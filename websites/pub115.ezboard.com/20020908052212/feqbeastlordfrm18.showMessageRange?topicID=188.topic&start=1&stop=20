I tend to be very vocal about the BL class and I don't think there is a person out there that can point to a single post I have made and show me talking negatively about the class I love. But here I am today doing just that. The turn around for me came when my own guild leader made the statement &quot;Beastlords bring absolutely nothing to the raid so why should I let them obtain items that other classes get more use from?&quot; How do I argue that with him? I mean I know his thinking is shortsided but in reality is he that far off the mark? Wouldn't a Flowing Thought 5 item do more for the guild in the hands of a shaman or cleric? Wouldn't that 17/19 weapon do more damage to a mob if weilded by a monk? When thought of in those terms how can you argue with him. <br>
<br>
I have be very active in expressing my opinions to the developement team. I have taken many many ideas that have been posted here and I have forwarded them on to VI in hopes they might spark an idea and get us some much needed attention. The problem is I'm just not seeing anything being done or at least not done fast enough. Some of the pet changes that went in lately &quot;unintentionally&quot; left us out. I have to ask why? Why is it everytime someone at Verant is quoted while talking about major pet classes that they later have to come back and apologize for excluding the BL class when they made that statement. Why has it been nearly a year now and I still don't have any unigue AA skills? And why do I still have a druid strength spell scribed in my spell book? a spell that is so clearly a mistake that it makes you wonder how many spells did they mean to give us but accidently left out.<br>
<br>
If any of you have been visiting these boards since the early days you will find that I have been a vocal proponent for the BL class. I vehemently detest the generalizations from the &quot;we suck&quot; crowd and I have fought very hard to make people aware of how valuable the BL class is to nearly any situation. The problem is now that I have played for over six months as a level 60 BL I have started seeing some of the high end issues become more of a problem and less of the minor annoyance I used to think they were. In addition to my 60 BL I have leveled an alt shaman to 60 this past weekend. Its is my third shaman and second one to 60. I never planned on this one ever taking over as my primary toon and I will quit before I let that happen, however in the last 3 days while playing my shaman I have received no less than 5 tells an hour asking me to come to ToV, Dragon raid or some other serious experience group. Wanna know how many tells my BL has recieived asking me to run across the world to join a group? exactly zero in six months. That says alot to me and it should to the developement team. It means there is a problem. Every single class in the game except for the Bl has one particular thing that makes them standout. While some of those things that make other classes wanted may not be completely unique to the class, SK's and FD for example, it still makes them a valuable assest. We have not a single thing that makes us a wanted assest to a group/raid. <br>
<br>
I apologize for venting but this past weekend really opened my eyes to some things that I hadn't been willing to see before. I know ther will be many of you that will post replies to this thread that will attempt to convince me I am not seeing the big picture. You will say things like Spiritual purity and Savagery make us a valuable assest, believe me I know these statements well because I used to be saying the same things. Hell I have even been know to chastise people that didn't see the value of the the class. The problem is that what we do have to offer is not significant enough to get people to seek us out on a regular basis. Look at it this way, you are forming a group in sebilis and you already have a shaman, enchanter, warrior, cleric and Paladin. You would like a sixth person and you see  a ranger, druid and beastlord looking for a group. Who are you gonna pick? Ranger has snare huge damage output and really nice buffs, druid has snare, evac nice nukes and tons of utility spells, BL has 3 hp/3 mana regen, a very situational ATK buff and mediocre damage output. Yes mediocre damage output because most people don't have the high end weapons that some of use were fortunate to have picked up along the way. <br>
<br>
I'm gonna resend this very post to VI in hopes I can get Rich to comment.   <p><img src=http://www.mbray.inet.net.nz/sig/bukar_sig.gif>

I agree 100% with your feelings. I have not been level 60 as long as you but i too know the feeling of being nearly "worthless" when compared to any other class.<br>
<br>
In regards to the weapons issue you discuss in the first paragraph: Dead on the the mark there.  I have had those same things said directly to me (in tells) by members of my own guild.  Why give FT or high DPS weapons to someone as gimpy as a BST?  No one relies on our DPS or our spells so why give us the good loot?  It's insulting but if i step back and look at it from another classes perspective I would have to agree with that feeling.  If i were a shaman and my guild gave a Helm of Grim Blessings (for those unfamiliar with the the helm look it up and drool) to a Beastlord over me I would be angry.  That is why most of the upgrades we'll get at level 60 will either be in a points based guild or by default, almost never by merit or virtue of our class.  And to make it worse VI decided not to add any decent level 60 gear tagged for BST only so the problem has no immediate solution.<br>
<br>
As many of us are hoping for, perhaps PoP will address these problems.  I really don't see anything getting solved before then. <p>Vecsus Strangiato <br>

I can't fathom why a company who creates a new class with an expansion, leave it unfinished for this long.   Is it so hard for them to hire more people (even if it's just for a temp time) to address various issues, small and great?<br>
<br>
Last I heard a couple months ago, top people in DAoC were working in closet space (I guess to save money *shrug*).  I've seen a photo of Verant's work complex; they are doing very well off.   <br>
<br>
They did this to themselves by letting issues (not just beastlord) build up more and more, while working on an expansion before Luclin was even finished (still not finished).   It's now bogging them down.   They need to get their @#%$ together and get stuff done NOW.  Then later, they'll have a lesser work load and be able to conentrate on any new issues that arise, more quickly and accordinally. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/uvashran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vashran</A> at: 8/13/02 12:32:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/uschezar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Schezar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Savage Hunter</span><br>  Posts: 498<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/13/02 12:57:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=188.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bukar's Rant</span><hr size=1> Well, I've been here since the beginning because I really liked the new class. I still like it, and I still have fun, even on raids. The class may not be an obvious powerhouse on raids, but it's still very useful. SP could use a boost, but even as it is every single class except epic wizzies wanted it last night for our emp raid. When used correctly Savagery is a very powerful tool as well, though I still think it should be made into a group spell.<br>
<br>
In terms of solo or group power it's really hard to beat a well played BST. Slows and good DPS make for a very powerful 1-2 punch. That we get halfway decent buffs to boot is also going to be something groups like.<br>
<br>
I dunno, maybe being in a guild that has always had lots of hybrids has given me a more fault tolerant view of things. We are by far the most versatile of all the hybrids (except bards, but they're just funky anyhow) and the most powerful for most of the game, only being surpassed by rangers who have amassed 57 AAXP points at 59+.<br>
<br>
In the end it boils down to what you want out of a class. BSTs have an awful lot going for them, and with the pet class fixes that are incoming will be pretty darn near perfect. But your mileage may vary. <p>See me at: <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47953">Schezarine's Sexay Stuff</a>

I have a small advantage in that I'm in a 50+ guild, not a high end type guild (quit the one I was in when my son was soon to be born).  My gear is steps beyond what anyone has because of my time there and being that most members are not 60 yet, I dish out more damage than almost all of them (but not by much =/ ).<br>
<br>
However, we did a raid on the Chardok royals this weekend and took out all 3, unfortunately, i was not on my beast.  With our level 60 shaman present and plenty of melee it was decided that I would be best serve the raid on my mage.  (Yes, I am one of those and this is the first time I think I have ever revealed that... 60 epic mage).  Yes, Savagery would have been nice to cast on the MA as she tanked the King and Queen but not needed and not even missed at all.  Yes, Spiritual Purity would have been nice for the added bonus, but not needed (KEI chanter in our guild) and not missed at all.  My mage fit the bill much better, not only did I provide the best DS, it provided FR as well.  I kept the clerics armed with T-Rods, I kept my epic pet out and whoopping butt (I love the upgraded epic pet, wow) and I added my nukes just about every battle.  I had our nukers armed with nuke bracers (my name for 'em - increase damage of nukes) and a few of our melees lacking resist gear took advantage of my elemental blankets and defenders.  I can honestly say I was far more effective than I would have been if I were on my beloved Sithrilon.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I love my beast more than any other class I have played (60 Mage, 57 Warrior, 60 Cleric, 59 Druid, and quite a few others into the mid levels)  I aim to keep on working on him (I never XP with my mage anymore - my former favorite) and improving melee the hard way - via AA.  I aim to keep involved in my posts and fighting for improvements.  I dearly hope that VI is paying close attention to our posts and our letters.  Otherwise, I will do the only thing I can do, which is be patient.  /bleh<br>

Ouch, if you're in a DKP guild and they won't let you spend it that just sucks.  If you've got the time(points) you should get to use them.  <br>

Let me guess... you wanted the 17/18 +20wis h2h weapon that was recently changed from BST only to BST/MNK.  And your guild leader said &quot;that's MNK loot&quot;.  /sigh <br>

<br>
If your role in a guild is to be a pawn, someone used as a means to an end, and not treated as a peer worthy of the same chance for benefits and upgrades as everybody else, why help phatten everybody else's inventory at the expense of YOUR game time? Go back to soloing, farm plats from HGs or whatever, and buy the stuff you want. So you may never get your epic, SS armor, or whatever you're after. Would you really have gotten these things from a guild with that attitude?<br>
<br>
The reason I won't even consider applying to a Tier 1 guild is I know I'll be put in the pawn role. I was as a Shaman, and at least they have some talents that are indispensable to a raid (Malo, Avatar). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/usnowleeper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snowleeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beast</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/13/02 4:33:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=188.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fairness</span><hr size=1> That certainly was a 1st tier answer!<br>

Shamans have Malo and Avatar, and often act as primary slowers even when Enchanters are present.<br>
<br>
If we had a 100% irresistable Sha's Advantage (except of course on slowing-immune mobs), we'd suddenly skyrocket in importance. Similarly, if perhaps we could AE cast Savagery, that too probably would be a ticket to ToV and other high XP groups.<br>
<br>
We're a very new class, and we've come out when VI is too busy to give us many tweaks to improve our happiness in the endgame. For them, their economics dictate they do things that improve happiness of Druids and Rangers because they represent over 40% of all server classes. Notice how Rangers will be able to self port in PoP? How druids got a right click port earring, and a clarity like spell?<br>
<br>
The other economic is if you have an alt, like that 60th shaman on the same account as your BST, VI stands to lose no income if you quit your BST unless you also quit your SHM. Extremely few BSTs have no alts in the game, therefore losing BSTs will actually not impact the subscription fees paid for EQ.<br>
<br>
I am one of a very few who have NO alts whatever. The old 60th SHM I used to have I can no longer play. So for me, it's play the BST or quit EQ. I've tried every other class and every race in EQ and have been the happiest with BST.<br>
<br>
I'm 56th now, and indeed getting a bit bored with how little there is to do anymore, how slow the xp comes... if not for being in a small guild that gives me groups a few times a week and having a lower-level SHM friend to group with, I'd probably be gone by now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub115.ezboard.com/ubukudahoesmakker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Buku Da Hoesmakker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><center><b><font color=#050369>Savage Overlord</font></b></center><br>Admin</span><br>  Posts: 867<br> <font color=#871F78>(8/13/02 5:14:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub115.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=188.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Bukar/fullsize/Bukarsmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bukar's Rant</span><hr size=1> Sokul before you jump on the &quot;we suck&quot; bandwagon go back and re-read my post.

I just want to see us where I think we should be not relegated to the low end game simply because of the class we play not because we the player lack skills. If you choose to quit playing the class then that is great for you. I for one am not ready to quit. I'm sticking around because I know things will get better, they have to get bettter. <br>

Now that I'm 60 I'm begining to see a lot of holes I did not see before. All the classes in the game get something worthwhile at 60. Beasts get a very limited atk buff and a slow I will never see, and a pet that even though is only capped at 55dmg still is not doing max dmg because of the pet haste problem. At lvl 60 I'm still feeling like I'm lvl 58 or even lower. The no class speciall aa thing is another stupid problem that should have been fixed by now, excuse the language but @#%$ the ui and bazaar because there is an unfinished class in the game with glaring problems. We should have been fixed before the ui or bazaar went in. I had to vent as well because I have been getting irritated with the class of late compared to other classes.

While I am usually right with Buku on the side of defending the class, in all honesty I'm usually, more often than not, jumping on someone not so much for what they said but how they said it.  Buku pretty much laid out many of the problems with the class, and retained a sense of professionalism and tact in his approach.  Aye, I agree.  The class has many downfalls right now, and my guild is slowly realizing these as I progress up the ranks, and while I'm better equipped than most of them, my power increase has been not quite as impressive as just about everyone else in the guild.  I played a monk for years... since about a month before Everquest got out of beta.  I have tried various other classes, and they never quite fit my personality, as it was.  Then the beastlords come out, and I like them.  I slowly start playing my beastlord more and more, till now he's equal level to my monk, and in all honesty, I will choose the beastlord over the monk any day to play.  But, Buku's right - we really don't provide anything that some other class doesn't already do, and generally do better.  Our spell list is mixed up, with Strength of Stone, and Sha's Advantage only recently dropping.  We are missing unique AA's.... and considering the AA's and Beastlords both were released in the same expansion, one would think that Beastlords would have had an advantage on the AA's.... but, we don't.  That's not a huge concern for me at this point, for I plan on working on many of the non-class-based ones, in an effort to counterbalance some of the shortcomings.<br>
<br>
Now, my guild is far from &quot;uber&quot;; I myself am far from &quot;uber&quot;; We're really not even high-end, but we are heading that way (even tho we try not to be).  Every day it seems more and more of my guild reaches 60, more and more of us have epics and Skyshrine armor.  Many of us have joined in on the upper-level raids like in Ssra temple and even a couple to Sleeper's Tomb (before someone woke the sleeper on our server).  But, we do hold a belief of not catering to the selfish, which results in many people leaving when they realize they can't have their own way.  As we don't cater to the selfish, I get equal chances as another person would on loot that I would use.  True, I have frequently turned that down, usually when the upgrade would be much more significant to someone else, rather than to me (like going from wu's fighting armor to thurgardin quest armor).  Luckily, not having a key usefulness in the raid isn't as important to me, because my guild likes me around, and we like to hang out together anyway.<br>
<br>
Maybe, just maybe, if Verant sees the problems we are having.... lacking the insults and flames directed at them (insulting the people who have the power to help you really makes your task more difficult, gotta be on the right foot for this), with reasonable, realistic suggestions how to cope with them (hell, some of the off-the-wall suggestions might work too - after all, how do you think Verant dreamed up manaburn?), maybe we will see the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel.  With hybrid balancing/gameplay adjusting coming down the road, I only pray that we get a massive overhaul, and become the class that was originally envisioned. <p><div align=center><img src="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/skyknights/OgulerSig2.jpg" alt="Oguler Denju" width=450 height=140>

Back on topic, even at 45, my guild appreciates me being there, but I'm not essential, just an extra bit of melee damage(and the food bitch. 'hey, keg, I need food.'

<br>
month ago.. <br>
&quot;We will start Bard balancing after we finished casters&quot;<br>
<br>
days ago..<br>
&quot;To say casters are balanced is like saying Everquest is finished&quot;<br>

How you like the new patch?<br>

Something that makes them desirable as a whole. <br>
<br>
Myself personally I soloed from 46-51. Then my solo spot wasn't lucrative anymore so I tried to go out and get groups again. (I ended up soloing all that time in the first place because I had given up on getting groups). Low and behold after 4 hours of trying to get in a group I was literally broken. My BST is my first and only character and all I got was a resounding slap in the face all day long that according to the masses BST is a worthless class. I was beside myself and almost quit because I was sick of feeling useless and being stuck soloing and being anti-social instead of the occassional group. I was fortunate enough that another hybrid that was in my guild felt my pain and suggested a few places for me to solo at my lvl. Sad that a BST can't even get into a pick up group. <br>
<br>
But as far as raiding goes thus far I haven't seen any real good use for us. Hell the biggest reason why I've got my epic now is because its the best and easiest attainable set of weapons for me. I don't really get overlooked in loot etc with my guild. Anything that is BST only is mine by default since I'm the only BST main in the guild anything else is decided by a loot council. Actually I've been fortunate enough on a raid with another guild being awarded boots that any leather class could wear. But I'm sure when push comes down to shove and that sweet Ulak or whatever drops I can guarantee you almost everytime its going to a monk. <br>
