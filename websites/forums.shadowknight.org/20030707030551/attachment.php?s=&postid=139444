Notes:

1) All pets have a reagent cost of 1 Bone Chip
2) You can give any pet a weapon.  This will not affect the delay of the pet's fist, but may affect the damage.
   The pet will swing for its own maximum damage or the (weapon base dam * 2) +1, whichever is higher.  Pets will not
   equip NO DROP weapons and a few "unbalancing" weapons (ie. Weighted Axe).
3) A pet's level based resists are determined by your level or its own special resist whichever are higher. (Changed in the     7/24/02 patch)
4) Unless changed recently, the higher level pet's lifetap ability does not work in all zones.
5) All pets from level 22 on can hit for magic with their fists, before that they must be equipped with a magic
   weapon to hit for magic damage.
6) The Pet's level is used to determine what weapons it can proc.
