But, about 6 to 8 months ago a guild on Mith Marr, Forsaken Realm, had on their website where they had let a druid tank AoW from start to finish.  <br />
<br />
Again, I'm not taking anything away from your accomplishment, I'm just stating that things like this are possible and then some.  I personally think knights should be MT'ing more often on raids due to our abilities to hold agro.  It's good to think outside the box and congrats on the tanking job.</font></p>
