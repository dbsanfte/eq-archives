<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">OK I know we are all constantly trying to get platinum! So, I figured I would share some of the ways I got platinum with you! (I'm not sure if this is in the right place, if not please move it to the correct place =) ) Also, if you have any advice please share it so other people can take part in it, too! You may or may not know all or some of these, but I just found them out and LIKE them =P<br />
<br />
<br />
Okie dokie, here it goes:<br />
<br />
<b>Gornit, Ocean Of Tears </b> - I recently discovered Gornit in the ocean of tears. He is a level 34-40 Hill Giant that spawns on one of the Islands. What you have to do is get the freeport boat, and wait for it to dock on the island in Ocean of Tears. Don't leave yet! Wait until the boat passes another island, and on the 3rd island jump out and swim to the ledge. You don't want to go up into the mountains unless you are adept at killing seafury cyclops. Hug the edge of the island until you reach a ledge near the buccaneer camp. In the water Gornit, the hill giant, may be spawned or not. He spawns in the water and he is about a 5-6minute timer. He drops anywhere from 1-45plat each kill, and I have made close to 1k (800-1,000p) in an hour camping with my friend. If there is someone already camping Gornit, I sorry =(.<br />
<br />
<b> Rathe </b> Ok, I know you have ALL heard of Rathe, but its always crowded! Right? Wrong-o. 3 days in a row I never saw more than 6 people in Rathe, and was killing HG's easily with a lvl 54 partner. I am lvl 38 and still getting experience. If you are around my level, spend a few hours here. The platinum is harder to make here but well worth it.<br />
<br />
<b> Burning Woods </b> You probably all know about Burning Woods, too. This is for 55-65 level people, no ickle 10-40's =P The Giant Fort in Burning Woods is a great place to make platinum! 5k in 4 hours of work! The loot is key here. Foremans tunics, forest loops, gems of all sorts, etc! Go wild with strength buffs and only leave when you c3-5 fades!<br />
<br />
<b> LDON </b> LDON is a good way to make cash and get experience. If you are bored, take part! It's not alot for an hour and a half of work, but its still plat. Plat, adv points, exp. You can get some good gear thru adv points, and spend your plat on some peridots for that Temp and Virtue. Not a great way to make plat, but still. =P<br />
<br />
<b> Gobbies! </b> You have all heard of this. If you are really low and just made your cleric, take part in the Goblin camps in ButcherBlock Mountains. Their blood and heads sell for 4p each to the magus. Great way for low people (lvl 6-11) to get money and exp. If I am just passing through, I will visit the one by Dragnors Cauldron and the one on the way to the docks. If you are passing through don't miss the chance to make an easy 50plat. If you want the exp AND loot, this isn't very good. Long spawn times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know you have probably all heard of these methods, but for the people who haven't heard about them, take part! It's a long road to the money you want, but well worth it. Also sell any items that are usless to you for a cheaper price then bazaar traders have. I usually sell -50 or -100 what the traders sell, its fast plat! Also, do quests around your level. I recommend <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com" target="_blank"> Allakhazam</a> for quest lists.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting! These may not be the best methods, but worked for me if you are patient at all =P</td>

Miraguls always gave us the highest plat of all the dungeons.  Guk was the lowest with Ruj not far behind.  Tak and BB seemed about the same, a little above Ruj.  I have about 200 missions, with the most in Tak (about 63) and about 30-50 in all the others.  All of these except for 2 have been level 65 dungeons.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Small little extra tid-bit to add to Buzie's info on the BB Green Goblins.  About half the distance from the PoK book to the fork in the road (on the right hand side) is a small little inlet with 3 Green Goblin Warriors.  If you are farming for plat, most people know about the main Green Goblin camp (near the fork), but if you wipe this camp, got to the warrior camp and wipe that too.  Good way to kill some time while waiting for other camp to respawn.<br />
<br />
Also... if you're camping main Green Goblin camp, keep an eye out for Wandering Greenbloods.  They also drop a gold medal (can't think of what it's called right now) that is also worth the same as the goblin heads and blood vials.  The gold medals stack too!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have noticed that the cash loots in Tak have become severly depleted since the release of GoD.  Before GoD that theme was the one that I found to be the most lucrative.  I am generally main looter for my group of 65s.  Where I was splitting up to 1000 if not more before, I am now lucky if I get to split 400.  It may very well be that we have had a run of bad luck, but we have done about 6 or 7 adventures since GoD came out and they have had lower cash than I have come to expect.  <br />
<br />
I have to agree, Spider silks are a great source of money as are low quality pelts.  I have found that a great place to get low quality pelts is in Marus Seru.  The hoppers there seem to drop the low quality hides or Greyhopper hides (which also sell well) quite frequently.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">For money, I still love Dulak. Make between 1.5kpp to 3kpp per kei on the boats there. Gem drops are great in this zone, even the low level mobs drop the 60 to 80 plat gems sometimes. The boat mobs often drop diamonds and blue diamonds along with other assorted gems. You can actually bother with the weapons they drop, about 5pp each. I usually hold on to the weapons till my inventory is full. As I get new gems, I destroy weapons out of inventory as necessary to make room for them. This way, I'm leaving the zone full inventory, no matter what. If you two box, it's awesome. Personally, I use my bst to farm here, but if you have a melee friend, can probably kill as fast or faster than my bst and make some good money too. On a side note, at 57, my beastlord still even get's exp. here, so it's not even wasted time, the farming.<br />
<br />
I'm told you make more in Seb., and I have the key for the place, but I have not yet tried it as I do not know the zone. Maybe soon.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">A few strategies I've found (prices on 7th Hammer):<br />
<br />
Low level loot: Keep the bone chips you loot and sell them in the bazaar for 5g-2pp each.  Same goes for zombie skins (1-10pp), spiderling silks (~10pp each), snake & basilisk eggs (not sure of price, but these must sell well as bakers need them and they're hard to come by) and all qualities of pelts (even ruined sell for a couple of pps each).  Several ppl already mentioned spider silks.  Someone also mentioned making low quality pelts into leather padding.  I highly recommend this, and want to add that you can make any high or medium quality pelts into low quality by combining them with a skinning knife in your sewing kit.  I've found that these two are much easier to come by than LQ. (Don't do this with HQ bear skins though!  Make those into handmade backpacks and sell for ~50pp).  <br />
<br />
Great places for farming pelts and silks are East and North Karana.  I also frequent the static spider spawns in Upper Guk.  They don't drop as many silks as the crag spiders in the Karanas, but you can clear the camp and tailor while you're waiting for respawn, OR run out to the Feerrott and farm spiderling silk.  I've found this zone to be the best for this, on the east side between the NE corner and the druid rings. <br />
<br />
Solusek B: Lots of fine steel weapons and some leafy greens and mushrooms (for alchemy or poison making I assume?) drop off of the kobolds here.  I duo until my inventory is full, gate to the gypsy camp right outside in Lavastorm, sell, shimmy back and start over.  It's very decent plat and *great* experience (there must be an xp bonus here).<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns: I imagine all the camps are good for pp in this zone, but the primary one is the Geonids.  These drop expensive gems quite commonly.  I grouped here with 2 others for a couple of hours one day and we came away with several hundred pp each.<br />
<br />
Prismatic dyes:  I've been making these since I read someone suggest to do so on this board.  Thank you! :) I camped my enchanter alt at the merchant in the lighthouse in Gunthak, have her buy the supplies, log on my cleric to combine them (requires mastery skill of pottery and brewing to combine w/o failing too often) then log on to my bazaar alt and have her sell them while I sleep.  The process takes about 30 mins to make several stacks, and I net about 15pp profit on each dye.  Brewing and pottery skills are easy enough to raise.  The best part is that the demand is steady for these - I never have a problem selling them despite the fact that there are several other regular dye sellers.  Drawbacks are that it requires some investment (about 1200k for 2 stacks) and may not be as convenient for someone without an alt to leave in the lighthouse.<br />
<br />
My last recommendation: check around before you drop/sell foraged or looted items, especially if you're low level.  Many of those things are required for tradeskills and will go for at least 1pp each in the bazaar.  Some of them may even be rather valuable!  You could make a decent living as a newbie selling bone chips/silks/pelts/foraged stuff in the bazaar.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Also, if you are a high level, keep those droppable items you loot! If anyone in your guild doesn't need them.. pfft...<br />
<br />
Also, if you fish up keys in abysmal, turn them into a guy there (dunno where he is friend told me about it) he will give you a troll illusion potion! Sell them to a vendor for 57p or sell them in bazaar for 75. Vendor is faster tho =P</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hiya,<br />
If plat is your game in 2004, I would try this (kind of cheesy and anti-roleplaying):<br />
<br />
1] kill wolfs, bears, and lions for their meat or hides (or visit merchants and buy from them)<br />
2] kill snakes for their eggs<br />
3] get your forage to max and run to a PoP zone and forage wildly<br />
<br />
Now set up your trader in the bazaar and charge:<br />
1] 2PP per meat, <br />
2] 2PP per egg, <br />
3] and anywhere from 5PP for hides to 300PP for rare foraged items in PoP<br />
<br />
Secondly, you can make intermediary tradeskill items and resell them in the bazaar:<br />
1] spoons, pans or cheese<br />
2] noodles and vodka<br />
<br />
The lists go on. With the new auto-inventory, folks stand to make lots of PP from helping "fledgling tradeskillers". I find that people would rather buy 100 stacks of cheese from the bazaar versus running to Jaggedpine forest - to make that lovely Pasta with Cheese!<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
