I've played on test off and on for about a year.  I have 2 characters there that are in their mid 30's that are relief characters.  Candarie is right, the test residents can be downright snobbie to "proddies" (from prodiction server, or non test server).  Even the most innocent /ooc  lis met with jears of "go home, proddie, we dont do that here" and other such nonsense.  Once you are 30ish, you are albe to find a little more acceptance but dont expect open arms till you reach 50 or so.<br />
<br />
If you are looking to start totally over, Stromm is the newest server, which is also a fresh start server.  It was opened awhile ago, so by this time there are already a quild or two in Elemetals, though I still think they are Time free at the moment.  Economy isnt ruined <i>yet</i> but everyday things are still expensive.<br />
<br />
Maelin Starfyre is another relatively new server.  Started about a year ago, it accpeted transfers from other servers that gave uber guilds a chance to make a run to be the first in Time.  Economy was trashed from the outset, but there are still people in the mid to low levels so grouping when starting from scratch isnt too hard.<br />
<br />
FV is ok if you like roleplaying, though not much of that goes on there.  It can be a hassle to learn the languages because no one speaks common there; the language doesnt exist.  Human tongue and elvish are the norm, but you run into all sorts of languages.  (there is one guild there that speaks only in obscure tongues like kobold and dragon /shrug)<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've tried all different types of servers.  Rodcet is still home though, even if it is infested.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">One thing about Stromm...Although it is the newest server, it is really no longer a new server. I'ts been around seven months and is does have a time guild...Realm of Insanity. It also has three elemental guilds as of today (If Decerto Verum beat Saryn today as I believe they did).... DV, Asylum's Edge, and Lost Sock Patrol. After these 4 guilds there is a huge gap before the next guild in the progression. <br />
<br />
There are still quite a few newbies in the newbie zones, but the twinks have also started to come out in force. The economy on stromm is horrible. Prices are incredibly high and there is still not a great quantity of high end items. <br />
<br />
Overall, I like the server, but it is no longer the newbie friendly place it once was.</td>

<br />
As for Luclin, we have a guild that had beaten Quarm and has since pretty well fallen apart and is rebuilding pre-EP. We have two other guilds in time, on phases 4 and 5. We have three other EP guilds, one of which is a small off-hour Asian guild, and another a Euro. Finally, there's one guild that lives in VT on patch days and is one RZ kill from getting into elementals. Plenty of competition for anything post-ssra.</td>

There is one other guild in Time as well (IvM) but they are not yet past tier 4 last I heard. The top guilds for the most part are all friendly towards each other and back flag each others app's. A-Ro also has a unique 'gathering' of players who form a strong raiding group to flag folks who do not belong to an 'uber' guild, so far they have been VERY successful killing many pre-elemental gods.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Yes, for quite a while Cypher was battling it out with RoI (who have defeated Quarm) in the elementals. Then they had inner guild issues and ended up disbanding. Many went to Rel in Por, which helped push RiP into the elementals. However, more guild problems caused RiP to disband, and many members from RiP got together and formed Decerto Verum. <br />
<br />
Some other guilds on Stromm that I forgot to mention that are in Luclin content right now are Prime Syndicate and Final Door. I don't know much about PS except for a while they were keying up to do Emperor SSra but hadn't tried him yet. Final Door just killed Emp for the first time and is about 20% keyed for VT.</td>

Now that cross-server transfers are becoming more commonplace, it is simply a good tool for those in situations like the original poster.  I can empathize with him, though in reverse - it's hard being guilded with people in a different time zone.  Using this chart, he can contact guilds and find one that fits his schedule and his playstyle.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I don't really have anything against normal servers but if you're bored you can check out one of the pvp servers.  By no means am I denigrating non-pvp servers, just throwing out the option there for ya.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek and Vallon Zek servers seem to be the destinations of choice for most people transferring in from a normal server.  I'd say Tallon Zek as well but we've been getting some transfers to VZ from that server and the people seem to be dissatisfied with the current situation there.  That is not necessarily an indicator of what is actually going on there though.  I don't think you can transfer to sullon zek so I won't discuss them.<br />
<br />
If you happen to be interested in Vallon Zek i'll break down the current situation.<br />
It's a team server but all of the top guilds have players from all four teams in their membership.<br />
<br />
Defiant has beaten Quarm but their recent recruiting/backflagging drive is going to slow down to a trickle very soon.  They are mostly PST for raiding purposes although they do include several europeans.  Defiant is kos to all major guilds but Aerist but raids with no one.  Their app guild is called Midnight Haven.  They have been the server power since about four months after velious came out.<br />
<a href="http://www.defiantvz.com" target="_blank">http://www.defiantvz.com</a>  is their website.<br />
<br />
Ancient Dawn is the resident european power, they've broken into time but I'm not sure how far they've gotten.  Phase 4 or maybe 5 I think but don't quote me.  They're not a bad guild at all although personally there's a lot of bad blood between myself and some of their older members.  They are marginally allied with Adeuntus although they don't often raid together.  Their app guild is called Fanatiques. <a href="http://www.ancient-dawn.de/" target="_blank">http://www.ancient-dawn.de/</a><br />
<br />
Zephyros is elemental flagged but has only killed Fennin to my knowledge.  They're currently in the process of restructuring but they still raid actively.  At this time Zephyros has no major allies.  Their app guild is Oblivions Dance.  <a href="http://zep.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://zep.blogspot.com/</a> is their website.<br />
<br />
Aduentus is elemental flagged and is prepping to start taking on the elemental gods.  They're kos to everyone but Ancient Dawn.  This is an interesting guild in that they have a good mixture of european and american players.  They've survived a very long time being kos to guilds that outgeared them but their pvp record in guild vs guild combat has been marred here and there by some questionable actions.  Still not a bad guild if you are not afraid of pvp.  <a href="http://web.webstore.fr/webabonnes/eq/aduentus/aduentus.htm" target="_blank">http://web.webstore.fr/webabonnes/e...us/aduentus.htm</a> is the only link I could find to their site.<br />
<br />
Aerist is not elemental flagged but they're catching up fast.  They do VT and farm the hell out of the tier 1 bosses and soon they will be making the push for elementals.  They have a good membership base, good raid attendance, and qualified raid leadership.  Aerist is not a bad guild to be in right now if you're looking to get familiar with VZ and want to be in an up and coming guild.  They are kos to Adeuntus and Ancient Dawn.  They are kind of in the middle of the current war between the main american timezone guilds.  Their app guild is called Mythic Guardian Council.  <a href="http://www.aerist.net/" target="_blank">http://www.aerist.net/</a> is their website.<br />
<br />
The purpose of app guilds on vallon zek is for potential members to have a tag over their head that prevents confusion in pvp and also for communication purposes.<br />
<br />
That's about it for VZ.  I make no particular recommendations and I won't say which of those guilds I am a current app of.  Just posting some info for you to consider since you asked. :)</td>

Weren't Defiant in power since Kunark, with them emerging the better after the fights over Sebilis with Prophets? Or am I completely mistaken? :)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Defiant were definitely a power in kunark.  They simply weren't the acknowledged server power until they came out of a four month stay in sebilis and starting killing everything in velious and doing a bunch of server firsts along with beating the hell out of everyone in pvp.  Up until Defiant made their move, Prophets were considered the de facto power because of their levels and gear.  This is the first time in my 3.5 years on VZ that I haven't been kos to them.</td>

I'm in The Celestial Rapture, the top guild on KB and we're always in the market for clerics, especially ele flagged ones. Have to be able to raid Euro time though. If you're U.S a good bet is Kamiff's guild, Evolutia.<br />
<br />
You can check us out at <a href="http://www.kane-bayle.com" target="_blank">www.kane-bayle.com</a> or make a lil toon there and scout around seeing what it's like. If you're bound at the stones in potranq, the only thing you have to fear is some horny lil dorf cleric grabbin' your butt every so often, but other than that he's harmless and makes a great coffee table, you can rest your beer on his head while expin'. /hides from Kamiff<br />
<br />
<br />
If you'd like more info, I'm available daytimes US time as Malicia when raiding and lately at night on my lil twink Rowrr, shoot me a tell if you'd like.<br />
