A place where I might share with you my adventures in the grand world of Norrath. A bite to eat, a drink to warm my soul, and simple bed to lay my head is all I ask in return for my meek but meager attempts at entertainment. Gather round now, and I, Matterius, will fill your minds with tales of action, tales of humor, tales of suspense, romance, and maybe a bit of mystery. Tales of epic proportions - at least to a young bard such as myself. Stories of heroes and villains, monsters and slayers, innocent travelers and pirates that sail the sea. All the parts will be played by me, of course, but you should still be able to identify with the characters as separate people. Close your eyes, open your minds, and be filled with the world I speak of. Enjoy. <br />

<br />
----Introduction, The Matterius Tales, 07-20-03 <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Gather round now, gather round, as I weave a tale that begins in the great City in the Trees, Kelethin, and ends in lands quite different, and quite distant. A story of family and friends, and the trials they endure as both. <br />
<br />
<br />
Metelius. A Ranger who calls the woods of Faydark home. A Ranger whose adventures leave him little time to return to such mundane surrounds as what you or I would call home. We meet up with Metelius today on one such rare occasion. He is visiting Kelethin, the largest city in the woods of Faydark, built in and around the giant treetops of the forest. Only reachable through the use of "lifts" it has been a safe haven to travelers for many a year. Met was riding up into the trees on one such lift this day. As the lift slowed to a stop, Met stepped onto the sturdy construction of the city floor. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, an arrow whistled through the air, directly at Met's head. In one fluid motion, Met snatched the arrow from its course, leapt into the air, flipped, and landed with the arrow notched in his own bow, and posed just inches from his attacker's own head. As quick as his motion had been, it may not have been quick enough, as his attacker now held a blade to his throat. <br />
<br />
"I could cut you down where you stand." The attacker said. <br />
<br />
"Cut me, and I release the arrow into your brain." Met replied. <br />
<br />
"It looks like we have ourselves a situation, then." The attacker said. "Put down your bow, and I shall lower my knife." <br />
<br />
Met grinned slightly as he replied, "I think not. You see, you cut me, you will die, but I may not. It just depends on how deep your blade bites before the arrow strikes you dead. On the other hand, I release my arrow, you will surely die, and frankly, my arm is getting tired." <br />
<br />
"Oh don't give me that." the attacker said as he sheathed his blade. "you could hold that bow steady for days." <br />
<br />
"And you are becoming quite adept with that blade, cousin Arenikus." Met said with a smile as he lowered his bow. <br />
<br />
"Good to see you haven't lost your edge cousin." Arenikus said as he embraced his older cousin. <br />
<br />
"Your skills are moving right along, Aren. It won't be long until you might handle a blade better than myself." <br />
<br />
"I have always handled a blade better than you... It's that damn bow you always win with." Aren said with a sly grin. <br />
<br />
"Heh, we will settle that later," Met replied. "but for now where is that brother of yours? I expected you both here today, or is he laying in ambush elsewhere?" <br />
<br />
"I haven't seen Elsman in months." Aren frowned. "He went off to try and track Kendorium through the Jaggedpine Forest last I heard. Apparently Els needed his help in tracking some bandits or some such." <br />
<br />
"Whatever makes him think he can track Kendorium? He isn't found unless he wants to be found. Not to mention as much as he travels there is no telling if he is even on the same continent. Surely, if Els could track Ken, then no bandit in the world could ever escape him." Met pondered this a moment then continued "Unless he thinks Ken will want to be found." <br />
<br />
"You know Elsman. There is no telling. Let's not waste our time while he wastes his. Let's get a move on." <br />
<br />
"Without a third, I don't think we can actually survive the trip I had planned." Met said with a degree of annoyance. <br />
<br />
Aren replied, "I know. That's why I arranged for a friend to meet us on the way." <br />
<br />
"You have friends?" Met smirked. "Who is this friend and how combat ready is he?" <br />
<br />
"She is named Lavendaar, and she is very ready" Aren said. <br />
<br />
"A girl? Why didn't I guess. With your reputation I am surprised you could even get a female Wood Elf to talk to you, let alone meet up for some half crazed trip across Norrath. Hell, I am having my own trouble trying to find one for myself that you didn't date first." Met replied with a straight face that hide a secret envy of his cousin. <br />
<br />
"Well, she isn't a wood elf, we aren't dating, and why do you need a girl when you have your bow?" Aren said smugly. <br />
<br />
"Not a Wood Elf? What then? A High Elf? Half Elf? Don't tell me you are trying to seduce a Dark Elf?" <br />
<br />
"Don't concern yourself cousin. She can handle herself." <br />
<br />
"Who ever heard of a Ranger named Lavendaar anyway." <br />
<br />
"Who said she was a Ranger?" <br />
<br />
"Oh no, what are you getting us into?" <br />
<br />
"She's a Cleric. A good one too." <br />
<br />
"A Cler.. A CLERIC? Now I know, you are just doing this to spite me. What is she going to do? Huh? Speak mean words to the enemy? Bandage their wounds after we strike them down? A CLERIC?" <br />
<br />
"Riiiiight, we better get going cousin." With that, Aren stepped onto the lift and hit the the switch to be lowered to the ground. <br />
<br />
Met stood there for a moment watching Aren be lowered, then had to jump down the twelve feet to the lift as it lowered. <br />
<br />
They both cast quick, but silent spells on themselves as lowered to the ground, enabling them to run at a faster pace. This was a tradition with the two of them. Met pretended to fume while Aren seemed to enjoy getting under his skin. This time, however, Aren also smiled as if he knew something more he wasn't letting on. <br />
<br />
At the pace the Rangers set, it was only a matter of a few days before they were on a boat bound for Iceclad Ocean. This was the longest part of the trip, as they could not speed up the boat. During this time they lost the demeanors they had put on in Kelethin, and became like brothers. Often found around the ship laughing, joking, telling stories, catching up, and drinking together, it was obvious they were friends. <br />
<br />
As the boat neared Eastern Wastes, often going out of the way to avoid icebergs and glaciers, Met and Aren started to become serious about the mission on hand. <br />
<br />
Met spent the last few hours of the trip drilling Arenikus on the plan. "So basically" Met concluded, "We slip in, track down the kobold jester, dispatch him, take his crown, and then we trade it to that Everdeath I mentioned to get you a really great bow." <br />
<br />
Aren wasn't sure about this, "So we are supposed to be able to slip in that deep unnoticed?" <br />
<br />
"That is what the Necro told me. She said it should be simple, and I see no reason she should lie, as she really wanted the crown." <br />
<br />
"No reason a Necro should lie, huh? How about the fact that they are a NECRO? She's a Dark Elf isn't she?" <br />
<br />
"Um, yeah, why do you ask?" <br />
<br />
"Yeah, that's what I thought. You talk about my reputation with the women, but everyone knows you will go out of your way to help a pretty face whenever she bats her eyes at you." <br />
<br />
"That's not true." Met said, turning a bit red. "And besides, YOU are the one bringing the Cleric." <br />
<br />
"Yes, I am. You will thank me later, but you are just too trusting. You think everyone is a good person. Anyway, she should be meeting us when the boat stops." <br />
<br />
"I will thank you huh? You trying to set me up with her or what? Is she hot?" <br />
<br />
"She isn't my type, really, but I am told by others that she is considered extremely beautiful." Aren said with a slight grin. "I told you, we aren't together, so if you want to go for it, be my guest." <br />
<br />
"Hmm. You're up to something." Met said warily. <br />
<br />
"We're there. Let's go" Aren said and jogged over to the boat ramp. <br />
<br />
A moment later and they were walking on the icy surface of Eastern Wastes. <br />
<br />
"Ah, there she is now" Aren said as he walked into the snow that had just begun to fall. Aren walked up to Lavendaar and hugged her. <br />
<br />
Met's jaw dropped. "A fro.. A FROGLOK? Oh Tunare, take me now." <br />
<br />
Lavendaar just smiled and said "Just like you described him Aren." <br />
<br />
Met blushed and remembered his manners. "I'm sorry, I um, heh, spend a lot of time in the woods. My name is Metelius, but you can call me Met." <br />
<br />
"I am Lavendaar, named for my purple skin obviously, and am pleased to meet you." <br />
<br />
"Let's get going" Aren piped up. And he quickly cast a spell on himself and on Lav, and and disappeared with her into the falling snow. Met cast the spell on himself, and followed a moment later. <br />
<br />
The run across the continent of Velious was treacherous at best. Covered in ice and snow, mountains were sharp and jagged. Cliffs were nearly impossible to see in the frequent blizzards until it was almost too late. Lavendaar was quiet through most of the trip, and Met could see the journey was rough on her. She was strong and kept up, but not used to the long treks at such a fast pace. By the time the trio arrived at Velkator's Labyrinth, Met was officially impressed. She may not be useful in a battle, but she was athletic. <br />
<br />
Just outside of the cave entrance to Velk's, the trio stopped and rested a moment. Then Lavendaar stood, and started casting spells on the three of them. Met felt his fatigue from the journey fade away, and felt much healthier than he ever had. Strength poured into his body and he seemed to be protected in a magical armor. Maybe having a Cleric around has its uses, Met thought to himself. Lavendaar had to sit for a moment to rest after casting so many spells. She began to meditate to relax, and the strain slowly faded from her. Then they were ready. <br />
<br />
They stood, and slipped into the cave, stopping just inside to take in the sight. The cave was completely carved from the ice, and the walls sparkled and shimmered with a light of their own. They looked around the entryway, and saw no enemies. <br />
<br />
"That's odd." Aren whispered. "You would think there would be guards." <br />
<br />
"Hmm" Met said quietly looking at the ground, "There are signs of battle all over this floor." <br />
<br />
"Maybe someone came in and wiped the bad guys out already." Aren suggested. <br />
<br />
"Maybe." Met stated. <br />
<br />
"I have a bad feeling about this." Lav said. <br />
<br />
"You Clerics always get worri...." Met's voice trailed off as he heard a skittering behind them. <br />
<br />
As one, Met and Aren whirled around, blades drawn... Only to discover nothing was there. <br />
<br />
"That's not good." Aren said. <br />
<br />
"Yeah, I have a bad feeling about this." Met replied. <br />
<br />
"Told ya so." Lav said. <br />
<br />
The skittering seemed to move around them, but it was hard to tell where it was coming from as the sound echoed in the cavern. <br />
<br />
"Let's move back out of the cave" Met said as the group started backing out the way they came. <br />
<br />
As they neared the entrance, two spiders shimmered into view. Each stood almost as tall as the Rangers, and taller than Lavendaar. Each of the sixteen legs that now stood between them and the only way out came to a razor sharp point that dug into the ice. <br />
<br />
"Your Necro friend forgot to mention the spiders here turned invisible?" Arith asked smugly, taking a fighting stance. <br />
<br />
Before Met could reply, the spiders leapt at them, attacking with several of their razor pointed legs at once. Met and Aren were both forced backwards, deeper into the cave. Lavendaar stood by patiently and seemed to study the battle, more than become a part of it. "Help us out here, there may be more!" Met shouted at her. <br />
<br />
"I am not a fighter." she replied back. <br />
<br />
At this time, Aren successfully blocked a leg that was thrust at him with his sword, only to be knocked back as the leg straightened, catching him in the chest. His chain mail took the brunt of the blow, but he was still knocked backward across the cave, such was the strength of the blow. Aren's head struck the icy wall, and he slid motionless to the floor. The spider that had attacked him moved quickly toward him. Upon seeing Aren go down, Met was distracted from his own fight. A moment later saw him impaled upon the spider's leg, lifted off the ground, clutching weakly at the large leg that penetrated his chest, and exited his back. He managed one last look at Arenikus, expecting to see a similar fate for his cousin, but instead, saw the other spider tangled in roots that had apparently grown straight up through the ice around the spider's legs, still several feet away from Aren. The spider holding up Met let his body slide off, and drop to the floor. Met stared blankly at the ceiling for a moment, and as his wounds went numb, he knew that he was dying. <br />
<br />
Lavendaar looked down at Met and asked "You going to lay there all day? I don't have the energy to hold those spider's off ya'll for long." <br />
<br />
What a stupid thing to say. Met thought to himself. Here I am with a hole straight through me and... His thoughts trailed to other things as his hand found his wound. Or more accurately, failed to find his wound. He sat up, and with a sudden burst of energy, realized he had been completely healed. He looked to where the spiders were, only feet away from the still unconscious Arenikus, both cutting away at the roots wrapped around their bladed legs. Met was suddenly filled with a tremendous amount of hate. Try to ambush me will you? Try to kill me will you? In one motion he unslung his bow from his back, and loaded three arrows onto the string. <br />
<br />
"Hey ugly" Met yelled at the spider that had attacked him, "Get you some!" The spider turned on Met, just as it broke free of the roots, and Met took aim and released the arrows. <br />
<br />
Arenikus awoke suddenly. It took him only a minute to remember where he was at, as he opened his eyes to the sight of the spider that attacked him. It was only a few feet away, but suddenly, it turned on Lav, who had sat down against the far wall. It seemed to be caught on something for a moment, then skittered towards Lav. Aren knew Lav much have cast a healing spell on him, as he felt as fresh as when they entered the cave. He bounded to his feet, then leapt into the air, flipping, then landing square on the spider's back. He used the momentum from his flip to drive his sword into the base of the spider's skull, spewing blood all over Aren, and killing the spider where it stood. He turned to aid his cousin, only to find Met standing over the body of the other spider, which now had the tips of two arrows protruding from each cluster of eyes, and a third from the monster's mouth. <br />
<br />
"You and that damn bow" Aren said with a grin. <br />
<br />
"Not as bloody as that blade." Met grinned back. <br />
<br />
"I think we should leave while the way is clear." Lav spoke up. "If these were only the outer guards, things will only get tougher as we move deeper." <br />
<br />
"She's right," Met agreed, "I really don't want to go through that again anytime soon." <br />
<br />
"Wow, you agree with a mere Cleric?" Aren Smirked. <br />
<br />
"Yeah, I think I may have been wrong all this time. I also think I will try to get a Cleric to go with me whenever I try another one of these schemes." Met said while holding a hand over the hole in his shirt. "You are a welcome part of my hunting party, Lav." <br />
<br />
"Thank You, I appreciate your kindness. This, however, strained me to my limits, and think maybe I should study a bit more before I try back." Lav replied with a grin. "Maybe wait until after I can afford some of the more expensive spell scrolls." <br />
<br />
"Maybe," Aren said as they headed to the cave entrance, "We can go back to Oggok and kill some more Ogre guards, and make you a little money that way." <br />
<br />
"You two killed Ogre guards by yourselves?" Met asked, looking shocked. <br />
<br />
"They aren't so hard when you have a good blade, a good Cleric, and can catch them alone." Aren said with a grin. "It's something we do when we need some plat. Those guards carry some good coin, and merchants will buy all the gear we can carry from them. And hey, they're evil, so why not?" <br />
<br />
"I underestimated you both, and overestimated myself, which almost got us all killed." Met said. "I tried to protect you instead of taking care of my own attacker, and almost paid for it with my life, only to find you were handling yourselves ok. Clerics are powerful allies you know." <br />
<br />
Aren and Lav laughed, and Aren said "Yeah, I know." <br />
<br />
Lav seemed to relax noticeably as Met seemed to accept her. With a giggle she told him "Hey, your a Ranger. You die so I don't have to." <br />
<br />
Soon after, they were aboard the boat home. Often found around the ship laughing, joking, telling stories, catching up, and drinking together, it was obvious they were friends. <br />
