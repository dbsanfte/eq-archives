<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, I've been with eq froa bout 6 weeks now and find myself changing classes every 3 days or so. And having trouble sticking with one thing. I have a 32 bard and lost much interest into it cause of its lack of casting and meleeing. As of right now I have a 14 high elf paladin. And seem to be having much interests in Clerics "Their amazing buffs and ability to heal and resorect. Although most Clerics are people who are older with kids, kinda like the protection. So, would anyone be able to help me with this problem that I am incountering. Yet I am only 15 11months of age and seems like most clerics are much older. Eq get frustrating when it should be fun. Please help if you can.<br />

<br />
what kind of help were you looking for?<br />
<br />
seems to me you are going about it the right way. when you try a new class you should at least play it to lvl 30. that way you get a feel for what the class can do. most classes are pretty equal in str and weakness till beyond lvl 30. <br />
<br />
no one can tell you a class YOUR going to like. my first caracter was a monk. big mistake, it is so hard to make any money as a monk as if you loot, your wt goes up and ac goes down. my monk made it to lvl 25. my second try was a warrior. my problem with my warrior was lack of healers lol. i had met a freind that also played a warrior, we would go out to gether and explore. well it got to the point that bandaging each other was no longer good enough for the exp we wanted, plus dying in bad places ment long CR (pre PoP) my warrior is now stuck at lvl 35. so i made a cleric to team with my warrior friend and i have never looked back.<br />
<br />
so alot of class picking has to do with what you want out of the game. i would never recomend a monk as a first time player. warrior is good, but without a healer they petter out around lvl 30. now a cleric, they can find a group alot faster than alot of other classes. plus, a cleric and just about any melee partner can find something to kill. i would recomend a cleric to a first time player.<br />
<br />
i also have now made a rogue my rogue is lvl 37 and i have a blast playing it, but it is twinked, so i am still soloing at lvl 37. my most recent alt is a shaman, and she is a blast!! i am soloing my heart out with her at lvl 24 now. i would recomend shaman as well for a first time player.<br />
<br />
alot of people go druid as first time players as well. since a druid at young age isn't as gear dependant as say a monk, warrior, rogue. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hehe. Keyera beat me to the post. Was almost done when boss walked in and I hit the X instead of the _ button. Oops. I will retype it any way.<br />
<br />
I started off as a Rogue. Made it to lvl 21 when bandaids got to be not enough. I had trouble getting a group as I always made people mad (so it seemed) because I didnt know how to play EQ much less a rogue. Made a Warrior next. Had fun. Got him to 27 when bandaids got to be not enough again. Odd hours of play made it difficult to get groups, but I was learning the game by this time. Wasnt that much fun to me, so I made a chanter. At 17, I decided that chanting wasnt for me....delete... Monk...21... delete.. then a friend wanted to Make a pair of Dwarf Brothers. We started at the same moment almost. Grouped up (no twinkin) and went out. We partnered together until lvl 18. Was cool, because we dinged on same kill 11 times. Cool I thought. I played  Phixin exclusively for 9 months before I started a new toon. Now have 7 toons over 35. I always end up comparing my abilities to a cleric.<br />
<br />
As Keyera said. You have to choose what you want to do/be in the game. Clerics have to sit and med ALOT, but have the ability to stand up there and get in the mobs face better than most casters, but your main job is to sit back and let the others do the fighting. You just plug the holes when they start leaking.  I also get lost easily. I make a TERRIBLE puller. I have learned my limitations. I can use all of my toons, but I am a cleric, and it took several toons to figure this out.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your search, but most of all. Have fun. And dont forget it is a game. Nothing to get screaming at the monitor mad about.</td>

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Kolayne is my first character. I started out a cleric basically cuz my ex when explaining the classes told me I couldn't be a cleric, I wouldn't be able to handle it and it would be too hard for me. At that instant I thought, "thats it! I'm a cleric." I love my cleric, and that's what i am. I play my druid and she's just not the cleric I want her to be. Initially with the druid, I liked her because she had track, and ports, and damage sheilds, and all these things that Korlayne doesn't have. I went back to playing cleric after playing the druid for a long time and was a tad frustrated. These days I'd much rather be on Korlayne. I don't like playing the druid. She's great and all, but I'm a cleric through and through. I think the reason I faltered that long was because Korlayne was still low. Clerics get better and more fun the higher level they are. Druids start out great. I mean they can sow at 14. But towards the end of the the game, all they are good for it ports (which they aren't needed for much anymore) and buffs. Tears is now dual boxed by bf who plays his 57 ranger in the other box and I group with them and i buff my great buffs and heal. She buffs her buffs and sits there. Its me that saves the day not her. <br />
I'm not trying to turn this into a "Clerics are better than druids" essay.  Cuz, I don't believe that. Druids definately have their place, and i'd never give mine up. I just beileve that, and that's what I was getting at, everyone has one class that they find and become. Mine is cleric. My bf has a 46 mage and he loves his mage, loves play him, but i watch him play the mage and he wants to be a ranger so bad. I've never pulled so many things off one person ever, "Stop attacking everything, you are a mage!!!" Don't give up on a class after a few levels either. You never know. Phixin and Keyera had wonderful points. I just thought I'd add a little personal experience of mine to the mix as well.</td>

I just can't seem to find the right server to play on where there is not people who just blab on and twickes everywhere and never respect any newbies. Not that they should get much respect any ways.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">here is a twist for you.  Have you thought of playing a necro.  Is kinda like the best of both worlds as far as caster/melee.  You get mega dots, can FD, can nuke, can heal some, can rez at lvl 53 for 93%.  You can lifetap your hp's back taking from the mobs hps.  You can regen your own mana up to and beyond clarity 5.  You can locate corpses (yours and others).  You can summon corpses out of anywhere.  And the big melee bonus is you have a wicked pet that rips stuff to shreds.  And you can fear kite up a storm.  Snare, fear, sick pet, dot and sit and med and watch the dot burn them down and pet rip them to shreds.   Necros are one of the best or the best soloers imo and one of the most powerful classes there is.   <br />
<br />
They are great for grouping too.  Or duoing as you don't need a healer when you fear kite.  And they can heal the partner when needed also.  Partner one with a cleric and you have a near unstopable combination.  <br />
<br />
I myself have a lvl 51 necro that has only 9 days played and has made over 60kpp.  I did have a good mentor that was a high level necro that I grouped with using my other chars so I knew more how to play them before I started it.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well in that case you are probably on the perfect class then.  With the plate armor and good offensive and defensive skills of a Pally you can't go wrong.  Plus you get priest type spells to boot (cleric).   Pallys are really powerful in the endgame also.  And valued highly.   <br />
<br />
As far as clerics are concerned I hardly do melee.  Unless i'm grouping and the tank is well enough equiped to where I don't have to med all the time to heal him.  Then i'll pull out my summoned hammer and mem Yaulp and go to town. We can do some amazing dmg with the summoned hammer which procs for up to 150dd (level 54+ for a decent one).  And can proc up to 20 times a fight when you have a good dex buff.   <br />

In normal play and raiding we usually stick to healing rotations, Keeping the main tanks alive.  And other healing strategys.  On some we'll nuke a bit or cast our reverse dmg shields.  It can get pretty intense and I enjoy playing the class a lot.   Of course we always buff everyone in one fashion or another.  <br />
<br />
I myself started with a Ranger and played her to lvl 56.   I created my cleric when my rng was lvl 40 and got her to grouping lvl and dual boxed her to lvl 54 where I then made her my main and flew past my rng in levels and experience in the higher end raids and zones.  <br />
<br />
For some a cleric can be boring as a lot of the time its Heal,sit, stand and heal over and over.  But there is a lot of strategy to what we do.  Esp at the higher levels.  If not played correctly everyone dies.  <br />
<br />
Oh another thought is to try a Shadow Knight.  They are just like a Pally in offensive and defensive skills but do not have priest spells (cleric).  They are part Necromancer and can FD, Dot, fear and even have a pet (but much lower then Nec's pets are).  <br />

Hope this helps you some with your decision.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">How's a Bard? Right now I have a 32 Bard seem fun when I play him but i always seem to leave him. And I am looking for a server, Seventh Hammer people i donno just can't explain it. I kinda want to go on a server with alot of expersinced people maybe? I have thought about making a cleric though. Seems fun all those high level buffs are crazy. As of right now i don't know what to do and it get frustrating, but i still ge ton and just talk to people cause i have nothing eles to do. I've played a ranger as well to 25 and i never used the bow i didn't like the ranger that much cause of i donno no plate. I was told by a duke paladin that the paladin's are kinda worthless. They don't do much damage and everything that they can do a cleric or a warroir and do better just seems like playing this game shouldn't be like this and that i am the only person that is having this problem. I came to this site because i was just looking around and came across it. It seems like a very well thought out community with people who are dedicated to the site. Speeking the truth about this game is that it is a wonder makes me think about all the other times i spend on other games sittin there wasting time. Unlucky most other newbies these days i myself had researched the game for a little bt before playing. And a friend told me about it like a few years before i started playing. I am trying to enjoy myself and see the high end of this game just seems every character I play has a problem with it something i don't like and i can never focus on what i like its always what i don't... So far atleast. Sorry for writing a book to you guys but i need some help and i am wondering what i should do as i await your posts.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Cleric and Paladins come from the same line of spells.  Depending on what you want out of your playing time will help you decide more...<br />
<br />
Clerics spend ALOT of time medding only to get up, heal, and sit back down.  In the later levels ( 56 + ) we get hammers we can summon and Yaulp 5 has mana regen so its possible you can still melee and heal efficiently.  I've heard plenty of people say clerics can also solo all the way up to 50+.  I have a hard time believing this but people do it.  I'll say this for now, it would be very difficult to solo, so as a cleric you are very group dependent.<br />
<br />
Paladins (although i've never played one beyond 21) are the melee versions of clerics.  They get the same spells (plus more) like the cleric but later in their life.  So, its possible to melee, keep yourself and group healed.  I would think its alot easier to solo as a paladin as well.  As a side note, Pallys DO get the rez line as well so you will be able to rez yourself.<br />
<br />
IMO, it sounds like you are leaning toward a paladin more.  However, level them both up to 30 or so and see which one you like more.. what do you have to lose?<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My main IS my 55 Paladin, enjoyed him alot, but post 50 grouping with my schedule can be disheartening to say the least. with only small pockets of time (2-3 hours) to play. I found post 50 game hard to play.<br />
<br />
So I made alts, first a Shaman, played to 15, then a druid, played to 41, then a monk, played to 19, and now Im playing a cleric, currently 23. I truly enjoy the cleric, and being a paladin for 55 levels, I know the spell lines well, so the adjustment was easy, finding groups quickly usually isn't a problem, and making many new friends in the process.<br />
<br />
I still play my other alts and main when possible, but the cleric is extremely fun because at any time, the entire welfare of the group could depend on me, and I like those risky situations that test my abilities.<br />
<br />
All I can suggest is play what you enjoy playing, after all, this is a game, and is meant to be entertainment. Times may force you to try other classes, or just play an alt, but above all..  HAVE FUN !!</td>
