<font color="orangered"><b>Whoever can tell me the most embarrassing story about an everquest experience, that YOU had, will get it all! I like to laugh, so odd's are if you make me spew Dr Pepper out my nose while reading it, you stand a good chance of winning!</b></font><br />

If your curious about what PP I speak of... <br />
<br />
<--------Look in my profile over there to the left. It was at 15k when I started this post. But you will get it all whatever the amount is at the end of the contest.<br />
<br />
One little rule, after your have got your account set up the way you want it. With all the fancy gadgets for your account from the <a href="http://www.eqcleric.com/forums/store.php?s=&action=main" target="_blank">EverQuest Cleric Store</a> you have to come start your own contest and pass on what you have left of the PP. Where by you must include the same rule for your contest and so on and so on...<br />

<br />
I was in a group with several guild mates in Plane of Fear.  I was a young cleric at the time and in some back row group not doing alot.  We were having a chat, and over the course of the long, drawn out Fear raid, things were getting more and more explicit.  There was another female in my group and we were having fun teasing the men :)  We started out talking about comedians and before you knew it the raid was 2 hours in and we were discussing sexual preferences and doing imitations.<br />
<br />
Guild chat had been silent the entire time.  The raid was carrying on in OOC/Shout (no channels back then).<br />
<br />
All of a sudden my entire guild sees:<br />
Candarie tells the guild, 'I DIG THE LESBIAN ANAL/ORAL!' <br />
<br />
The rest of the night was me with a bright red face and my group trying miserably to explain how that could possibly have been in context.  It got copied around quite a bit, because half the server seemed to hear that one line of guild chat :) (the oh-so-subtle error: in that one line, /g became /gu)<br />
<br />
I still to this day occassionally get asked about that (in jest).</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">When i had a ranger (ugh...) as my main i decided that questing for a Swiftclaw Sash would be a good idea! So i enlisted the help of a 55 Monk friend and off we went hunting for the heretics... After about 8 hours of camping the entire zone and running from end-to-end countless times, we both finally had the right amount of heads to complete the quest...<br />
<br />
We both went to the NPC, he handed his in, and got a sash! I handed mine in, and poof! The container, and the heads disappear!!! Upon careful scrutiny of my actions we eventually realised that i'd made one fatal flaw - i'd forgotten to press the 'combine' button on the container...;( <br />
<br />
I was pretty mad by now, and tired (think it was about 4am?). Mainly mad at myself for my stupid mistake when i was just starting to consider myspelf past the 'noob' stage.. I was gonna give up when my friend suggested asking a GM for help, saying that although i made a mistake, the items still should have not disappeared.. To which i agreed!<br />
<br />
So after wrestling with the GM's for about two weeks, they finally re-imbursed my container, complete with heads! Off to the NPC i one again went, did the hand in, and.... Gratz! One Kejekan Tribal Headband... :,(</td>

     I was a leet level 16 with all bronze, and an Axe of The Iron Back, WITH an Axe of Frost.  I was going to start a new guy,  with leet old gear, so I was selling this Brazen Brass Kiliji or something.  I unequipped it, and showed a guy.  I didn't have room in my inventory so when he cancelled, the weapon dropped.  He picked it up and ran.  Can you believe that?  Grrrrrrrrrr......</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Sadly I have a few of embarrassing moments - none probably worthy of winning the PP but worth a chuckle if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Firstly I was in the Karanas as a lil barb warrior and we decided that we wanted to head elsewhere.  Whilst running to the spires we heard the 'spires will cast in 2 mins' message.  However, we had a griff in tow that would smush us within the 2 mins to headed across the bridge and zoned to loose it.  Zoned back, it ahad gone and the spires had one minute till cast.  Ran like fury up to the Scion woman with the necessary text ready, hit return, really chuffed I'd made it and found myself naked back at EF, with my husband packed up laughing, pointing out (between the hysterics) the difference between return and auto-attack (<br />
<br />
Similar story in Tactics too but this time on Hinmer.  Just killed Behemoth for my proper flag and headed over for a guild group there.  Got there first with hubby in tow and went to talk to the lil gnome guy at ZI.  Suddenly my hit points shoot down to half and I'm being shouted at to run like the wind to the zone out.  I'm hightailing down the stairs thinking 'good job its only me and him.  Really embarrassing if anyone else knew'  when over ooc came 'OMG Hin, you hit the gnome' and various other uncomplimentary things from my guildies who had just happened to enter.  So the whole zone then knew and I can't go in there now without several peeps standing between me and the gnome to protect him (<br />
<br />
And then the time in /gu when I was explaining to all who'd listen about how I was gonna whip some mob or other when my appalling typing (and sheer bad luck) took over and I came out with 'And I'm gonna wipe his ass' :(   to which some sharp eyed guildy replied something to do with toilet roll and whatever takes my fancy.  And that got a star outing as quote of the month on the guild site - hmmmf...</td>

Was running thru EW chatting as I went... and ran off into the canyon leading to Kael... took Phixin took 20000hp damage.. Larry took almost 500hp damaging snotting pepsi from laughing so hard... so on the run back to rez myself, I was telling one of my best online friends how I had just taken 20k damage... and ran off the cliff again.<br />

That time, my buddy took the 500hp laughter damage.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">this was embarrassing i think:  my husband & i have been learning languages, set up hot keys and all, usually we are partnered when we do this so that we don't annoy anyone else.  mine is simple.  5 lines, one word each...it ends up saying "Can you hear me now?"...his are a little more explicit.  so one day, grouped with some other folks, we decided to start doing languages and he hits his hot keys...and he proceeds to tell the group in COMMON tounge some of the sexual things he likes doing with me.  i almost camped right then and there.</td>

Ah well...I guess, the time that I started my twink ranger, and at the time, I had no idea endless quiver was an AA ability, and I thought that it was somethin you could buy and put one quiver in, and it would last forever.<br />

Anyways..I proceed into our server market and /1 PC on endless quiver?  And everyone starts laughing and calling me a moron...it was completely embarassing.  :,(</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">hehe... good ones all... Here's mine... <br />
<br />
Few months ago my guild was trying to drop Mr. Marr... well being the Marr worshiping paladin I am, I didn't really take kindly to this, but needed the flag desperately... Zoned in a little late and invised my way to his room and found my guild on the right side of the doorway... a bit later, Mr. Marr did not think kindly to our guild trying to kill him, so he wiped us... <br />
<br />
Working on another computer while we did the CR, I did not realize that everyone had moved to the prep area just left of the building entrance... I ran, invis (with potions mind you), directly to MM's room thinking that's where we'd prepped... well... I didn't see the guild at all... seems this was not the prep spot the guild had in mind... I turned and ran back out (still invis) and found the guild on the left side of the building entrance... then I hear one of our scouts shouting, "Oh S**T, someone just trained MM's Room... <br />
<br />
Still invis, I figured it hadn't been me... well... little did I know, some of those mobs see invis and I had trained our newly rezzed-buffed-CR'd guild with about 20 mobs... needless to say, I was solely responsible for our 2nd wipe of the night... I felt terrible, but I was cheered up by guildies saying, "Awesome Train bro!" and such... My guild leader and raid officer weren't incredibly happy with the situation, but both reluctantly forgave my error. We went on to kill Mr. Marr and I got my flag... =)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well it is well known amongst my friends in EQ that one of my true passions are trains. I enjoyed everyones stories and many of them made me laugh or at least smile and shake my head.<br />
<br />
But I decided that Merigol is the winner. Trains in BB and the like are funny, but training a GOD is the best! I envy your train Merigol! Some day maybe I can have such a wonderful train story to add to my list!<br />
<br />
Now, as the winner, this means that you can use the PP for whatever you want to improve your name, signature and custom title. After that I ask that you take the remainder of the PP and start your own contest of any kind and pass on the rest of the PP to the winner of your contest.<br />
<br />
Congrats Merigol!<br />

<br />
I was just a wee cleric, welding my most recent spell "Bind Affinity".  I mistakenly believed it to be something like TL to bind point...  my knowledge of eq was limited at the time...<br />
<br />
So, running around in East Commons, back when there were lots of high levels there.. oh wait, there are high levels there again... anyway..  some guy is /ooc ing that he needs a TL to bind... I think you know where this is going.   I try to hook him up, he pays me, I group with him, and cast...<br />
DOH!   You feel yourself bind to the area....   made for one very unhappy peep... giving his money back didn't seem to help... this was before the days of PoK books...</td>
