<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">So, what kind of craziness/myths/wacko theories have you heard over the years?<br />
<br />
My favorite was when I first started I heard that if you handed an SG a gator meat, he would give ya 10 plat in return. Yes it's crazy now and obviously a hilarious ploy to get newbies killed. But back when the game first came out, no one actually knew unless you had tried it or knew someone who had. I mean come on, 10 pp! Man just think of the possibilities! Anyways, I honestly wondered about it for a couple days, thinking the whole time it was a trick, but at the same time, going "what if?" LOL<br />
<br />
Then there is the Ancient Cyclops theories! Everyone you know has the "secret answer" of how to make him spawn and they know because they have proven it! I mean come on, if everyone has a fool proof method and they are all different then why is it they all work? If there was honestly a "trick" to make the AC spawn, don't ya think after 4 years the info sites would have that info already? ROFL come on! No one get offended please. I have tried all the AC theories I could find and 12 AC laters, I can honestly say they all work. Which obviously is a clue to something here! LOL Maybe it's like some people really say, "just kill everything and pray the god's shine upon you this day!" Personally, I think he is a rare random spawn. Just kill it all and let the random mob generator sort it out!<br />
<br />
So, what else have ya heard over the years or even recently? Silly? Funny? Serious? Let's mull em over and see what we can solve! /confused <br />
<br />
I think if anyone in the world of Norrath can firgure out the meaning of the Norrathian life, surely it would be us Clerics! Right?! /yes <br />

<br />
A new person to the game was being a big jerk in our party for like 3 hours.  We put up with him because we needed the tank.  A bit later he asked us if we knew anything about quests he could do.  A fellow party member told him that EQ had a full quest list loaded in now just type /q.  I personnally had no idea what he was talking about either way (and was quite curious if this was true).  Well needless to say a few seconds later we were looking for a tank.  It was quite mean to do...but at the same time he kinda deserved it.  I suppose that it wouldn't work on anyone who knows what they were doing...but I have to admit it would have worked on me...I didn't know any better.<br />

Easiest way to see it is to go to one of the mansions, with models off, walk into the wall, and sit/stand. Your camera will go through the wall, and you will see the tunnel behind the rock next to the firepot that clearly is a zoneline. Only reason i got in there was due to a really odd bug concerning lag, and lding through a place with a cable modem. It was interesting. just a plain tunnel, standard neriak graphics. it led down, turned a 180, and down again, in the middle of that turn is the zoneline. I hit it and was ported to the succor point, while giving me the error "that zone is not ready to recieve players, taking you to a safe point inthis zone"...the same error i'd get when riding the boat in Oasis before i had kunark. <_< >_> <_<</td>

About 3 months after EQ was released it seemed there was a MAJOR influx of beggers that came about. One of the things I use to love to do, was to tell them to stay right here, I would bind, run to the bank, grab 10000000000 copper pieces, gate back and hand it to the newbie. They would be all excited thinking, I'm rich! But when they went to walk and was perma rooted, they would send that inevitible tell, "I can't move please help". That's when I got to drop the bomb.  I would say "Tell ya what, instead of begging why don't ya try earning your way like the rest of us had too, the only way your gonna be able to move is if ya drop some of that coinage or share it with someone else". It was just plain great to see them wrench at having to share or drop their coins! Of course ya can't drop coins now and ya either have to share or destroy them, which makes it even better. I haven't had to do that in a long time, but if I ever get the cahance you can bet I will.<br />

All of these are off topic but fun to discuss none the less.<br />

Along with the truth of this "myth", another myth from HHK that proved false was: If you bought a room key to HHK, you could store your stuff there and no one could take it. /yes <br />

This has a basis in truth actually. Back in Year 1 of EQ, there was indeed a patch that ended up making it so you could forage/fish a CoF(Cloak of Flames). The servers were only up about 2 hours before they were taken down due to this.<br />
<br />
Another "myth" that still seems to persist is: Skel form makes you non - KoS in Hate Plane and Mistmoore. This was only true for a brief period, then it was changed due to it's "unbalancing nature. Yet there are still people who ask if it's still possible, 4 years later.</td>

This is still considered to be true by many. Including myself. I have experimented with this and will swear black and blue that my food lasts a lot longer if its placed in slot AFTER a plains pebble. Many other rangers agree.<br />
<br />
I have not seen the Neriak hidden zone, but I have seen some seemingly hidden areas in many zones. Its easy, just go into wolfform and put your nose into a wall, you can see through to the other side (it can be very handy at times). Try going into HHK to the top floor and putting your nose into a wall (in wolfform), you can see most of the keep.<br />

I have heard this one before and can't help but laugh everytime I do. Absolutely no truth to this one at all! No Offense Savyrass. <br />
<br />
No one be offended by my following statement, I am not directing this at anyone in paticular.<br />
<br />
Here is my best advice for decideing if something is true or not. How long has the theory been around? If it's been around a while and not come about due to a recent patch, then do some research on the main info sites or class specific sites. If nothing is posted there to confirm it, then guess what, it's probably not true. Don't you think, if after 4 years of EQ being LIVE that if something exists, like a 4 year old rumor, it would already be on one of the info sites, confirmed?! 400,000 people out there playing this game, trust me if someone has discovered something to be true, their human nature can't help but want to get credit for discovering the answer. Someone would have revealed the truth guaranteed! Sorry, I'm one of those people who has to have proof before I believe anything, or test the theory myself proving it correct or incorrect.<br />
<br />
I started this thread to help me remember some of the funny myths that have existed over the years. And you guys have helped me remember a bunch I had forgotten and some I have never heard. I certainly didn't want to start a debate thread, I apologize if that is what I just turned it in to! /confused</td>

No offence to me, I know that one isnt true.<br />
<br />
But you cant always prove some of the things in game. For example the plains pebble thing. Its pretty hard to actually prove that you eat faster or slower either way as there may be many more factors involved. But many people, myself included, believe that it works. Ive done enough testing of it myself to believe it. But either way it does no harm :)</td>

It was level 1, had more or less millions of hitpoints, hit for like 1 or 2 or 3 max.  I took a rogue and enchanter down there, equipped enduring breath, went in the water, and hasted the rogue up with the enchanter (ragebringer + AQ = 100% haste capped), and turned on autoattack.  Noticed the thing wasn't really losing health.  Rehasted, went afk, came back about 15 minutes later and the thing barely had a dent in it.  I don't remember if it was at like 97% or 99% or 100%, but I just remember it was going to be a 15+ hour fight or impossible to solo with the rogue, so I gave up.  Anyway, it was perma-rooted, so you couldn't really "pull" it by accident with an AE, but the river being alive thing is more or less true, and you could probably aggro it if you AEd while under water.  Thing is, aggroing it would not matter one bit, because it was level 1 and hit for 2 max damage.</td>

Then I remembered this thread and giggled as I checked the Agility for each char.<br />
