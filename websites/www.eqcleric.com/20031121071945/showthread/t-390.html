<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Okie, this is my first time posting here, im SO glad to find an active forum just for clerics! The others i visited are all dead and buried =(<br />
<br />
Anyway, my question is this - Earlier tonight, a friend who hydras or has hydra'd in the past, 2 different clerics told me that i have my spell configurations all screwed up.;( <br />
I am level 52, and my spells are where they were pretty much since i got Cheal. That being :<br />
Cheal<br />
Superior heal<br />
Group heal<br />
Celestial heal<br />
<br />
Despite the slow cast times on all of them, i've never had a problem with these spells before. I very very rarely lose a group member to poorly timed, long casting spells, and try to keep everyone fully healed, if i have the mana for it, beyond my reserve.<br />
<br />
The friend argued that i should NOT keep strict tabs on anyones health but the tank, the chanter and myself. <br />
he also said that i should instead use these heals.<br />
<br />
Cheal<br />
Remedy<br />
Celestial<br />
Divine (When i get it.. Come on, 40% more xp to go!)<br />
and disreguard group heal and sup heal as inefficient. <br />
<br />
Well... Im at a bit of a loss now. As i said, i've never had problems before, and even found that Remedy just doesnt fill up health. Granted, its more health for less mana, but isnt a spell that heals all the damage thats been taken just as effective as two less mana costly spells for slightly more healing?<br />
I know its confusing, but to cast a spell twice in a row seems even less efficient to me... What do the other clerics do?<br />
<br />
Also, group healing... i personally HATE seeing a person at low health, and even more so, my whole group with just a bit of damage. I know i can top off their health quickly and easily for a chunk of mana. As i said, if i have the mana, i happily do it, but the above friend said NEVER to do this. While i can see the effectiveness of doing this often, or for healing only two people when casting two Sup heals would be less mana and a great deal more healing, why is it so bad when you have the mana and inclination? <br />
So there's whats bugging me.. Can some high level clerics, those around 52 or so :D  give me some pointers, or tell me the spells you keep up at all times? Thanks in advance!</td>

Cheal<br />
Remedy<br />
Celestial<br />
<br />
<b>Remedy</b> - the puller has taken a beating and all other heals are out of range and 'OMG heal him NOW' heal. Also known as the 'WTF why doesn't the MA's cleric cast CH's on time - bah I'll slip in a remedy to keep the guy alive whilst that lazy **** cleric thinks about doing his job' heal. <br />
<br />
Amazingly fast cast time and range - frankly this has saved quite a few lives in my groups and raids I've been to already and if you haven't loaded this one then you should. You won't regret it.<br />
<br />
The quicker cast time and longer range more than make up for the lesser number of HP healed compared to Superior Healing. I use Celestial as a general purpose heal.<br />
<br />
I never use group heal unless we've all just zoned, are all very low on health and we're in a relatively safe area.<br />
<br />
In a live group situation I tend to fill up slots with 2 or 3 stuns  and would rather be able to chain stun a mob and prevent damage, than have a slot taken up by a heal that I might use rarely.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">A lot of it I think depends on what your fighting... Remedy is almost a must for me (I also play on PvP server though). The HUGE range is has coupled with the fast casting has let me heal multiple party members outta the magic 1 bub of life and agro everyfriggin thing... Also on PoN mobs... they hit so fast, so hard i cant get a 4 or 5 sec spell of in time, so i chain cast remedy till the druid/shaman/pally/beastlord gets a heal off to give me the needed time to properly heal. Celestial Heal is great, heal someone taking moderate damage and move on to the next needy victim and they can maintain... or Celestial Heal because slow wont stick to give me time to cast the Complete Heal on th quadding 400 monster... All are usefull, and as long as no one is dying, min down time to med, then to be honest, no one should complain. <br />
<br />
Ever notice how at level 60 people tell ya how to play cleric... Because they got a cleric alt to 20 once? hehe, everyone's an expert... Just my 2 bits :)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Typically I don't have a group heal up in an xp group; however, I do have one up during raids. <br />
<br />
For my level, 56, I always have the followin active:<br />
<br />
Divine Light<br />
Complete Heal<br />
Celestial Remedy<br />
Remedy<br />
<br />
I rarely use Divine Light during a fight because it's not necessarily fast and certainly not mana efficient. I'll use it to after a battle, however, when  CH isn't necessary. Remedy is typically for the chanters and other castors. Celestial Remedy is, likewise for casters or if someone has gotten nicked. I usually use it if I'm grouped with a shaman/chanter/bard who isn't getting the slow up in time (Ill cast it on the tank just as he is pulling) or I will use it if we're forced to break a camp with unmezzable and or rootable mobs, as the celestial gives me extra time for that complete heal to land.<br />
<br />
As for not healing others in the group. Umm, I do. But, sometimes the shaman or druid wants to/doesn't mind watching other people, so it all depends.</td>

Im going to keep it up from now on, and maybe take out group heal... i certainly dont mind switching it out of my standard grouping configuration for new spells. I think mostly, the guy just made me so mad, telling me not to bother healing anyone else, unless of course they were about to die. I just hate that kind of arrogance. <br />

I keep both my divines up cause sometimes you have to draw agro and when it does I can usualy channel a divine through  and then drop it as soon as tank has agro back or in the rare case of a total wipeout I can use it to mem gate and then come back it has saved alot of time binding right outside where we are hunting and gateing out during wipeout and coming back to rez , or if a raid is gone bad and we need to try to camp a cleric I will hit divine and then /q out 90 percent of the time by the time divine wears off I'm ld and mobs ignore me although sometimes they notice me hehe when I get back i'm naked but normaly it makes for fast CR cause we have a cleric there to start rez's immediatly my spell setup might not be what anyone else would use but it works for me and I rarely have people die unless the mob throws out some real bad damage , my wife is a druid and is usualy grouped with me and as such I can tell her since she is next to me when I need her to pop the tank or whoever for that matter with a small heal just so I have time to get that CH off hope this helps and realize you need to find your own style and setup that works for you it will happen and only comes with time so have fun learning what some of us old timers have had 4 years to do you won't learn it over night but with places like this board you will learn from others mistakes and previous experiance</td>

<br />
However, all that has changed.  PoP mobs are so unpredictable.  They hit random amounts and quick. My spell line always is:<br />
<br />
Complete Heal<br />
Divine Light<br />
Remedy<br />
Celestial Heal<br />
<br />
I sometimes also mem the group heal for encounters where a DS is involved ( HoT ) or it just looks like everyone is getting agro.  <br />
<br />
Divine light is a GREAT upgrade from Superior Heal.  After getting this spell, I moved Sheal to the back of the book.<br />
<br />
Remedy has saved my tanks, enchanters, myself NUMEROUS times in PoP.  Very quick heal and with Blessing of Faith I can repeatedly cast it on tank until I've stabilized his health enough to Cheal.<br />

If you're comfortable with your healing style and you keep everyone alive, use what ya want :)</td>

I cant tell you how many times the group heal has saved my party. If everyone is taking a beating, but the chanter is about to die, I hit 2 which is my macro for "stand close, group hug" and casts Group heal. This saves the chanter and everyone gets a hp refill at same time. Groups also love seeing everyone in the group get 400 hp, so it helps morale too. <br />
<br />
 I macro everything now, just to let people know what's going on.  I also have a macro that targets the MT, casts CH, and announces it to group. That saves one button from having to be pushed. I set one up for healing the Chanter if I have one too.<br />

Remedy v/s Superrior Heal? .... Doubt that I will ever load Superrior again.<br />

If you cannot keep EVERYONE upright, your goal becomes keeping as many as possible upright.  That usually means keeping the MT alive to hold agro.  Of course, raid situations can change that a lot, but that's really a seperate discussion.</td>

Amen to that one, Brother!<br />
<br />
Xp groups actually become trivial, in my opinion, when everyone controls aggro properly. In fact, I've seen remarks from the non-MA about how they purposefully grab aggro to keep the Cleric awake! Bah! Hope they're joking!<br />
<br />
I warn my group that my first priority is to keep the MA and myself alive, with secondary priority going to the slower and mezzer...others are last priority. So it is everyone's job to keep the mob hitting the MA. I don't think most non-healers know how very mana wasteful it is to be healing the non-MA...sheesh!<br />
<br />
My most recent great group(s) was our latest guild raid in PoG. We had 2 groups (mainly low 50s people) and I was the only Cleric, so was in group one with the MA and SA and slower. There was a shammy in G2 for healing them, but everyone was so awesome about aggro control that I only had to heal the MA, and SA on adds. It was great! Worked like a well-oiled machine. But, those groups can go from trivial to disaster in moments, when the wrong guy(s) starts taking damage!</td>

I couldn't agree more, obviously my job is to keep everyone upright and healthy.  However, I have *one* MT, no one else is allowed to taunt, if they do I yell at them.  ;)  It's hard enough in the planes to keep those with low hp's up if the get aggro let alone dealing with two tanks trying to out damage one another, timing the ch's on those two can be horrible.  Thankfully, I generally group with a great bunch of peeps that know this.  :)</td>

You'll find that as you progress from 52 and start getting closer to 55+ that  celestial healing will be used less and less , unless its just to top off a Paper Tank or Caster , in between fights ...</td>
