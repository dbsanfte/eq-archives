<br />
Forget about targeting someone above the level cap and expecting those below it in your group getting the buff either.  It will not hold on them.<br />
<br />
This will certainly change the way that people have been playing (new players, alternates, powerlevelees, etc.)<br />
<br />
After reading this I made a mental note to start doing a little research on what cleric spells I have that are group buff level restricted and seeing how it will affect my little enchanter (level 34 now) that I have been powerleveling.  Something for us all to think about because the change may not only be made for enchanters KEI if it makes it "live".</td>

<br />
Seriously, this is a *great* idea.  Sorry, but who actually runs through PoK saying, "Anyone casting Clarity?".  I donate more than an average amount for KEI but I would be happy to have to take the lesser cousin if it made the game more fun for middle level Chanters.  SOE Puleeeeeze help me with my terrible habit, I'm sure its doing bad things to my brain.<br />
<br />
Level restricting spells to within even 10 levels would be an improvement over the way things are now.  Just imagine, Rez 10% might actually be in demand!!!!  My DARING spell might actually stick on Tanks sometimes.  My heals would heal more than 5% of a 15th level fighter's HP coz they wouldn't have 2000 of them.<br />
<br />
If the middle game were more fun people wouldn't be in such a hurry to get past it.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Penecillin the thing you said about the "middle game" was rather an eye opener.<br />
<br />
I got over being bored with EQ by starting a few alternate alternates (I already had a main alternate if you get my drift - on another account)  Well those alternates are in the middle game.  They are not uber and consedered to be quite lame to most I meet in groups.  I am sure most know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Your insight on the "Daring spell might actually stick" or "heals would heal more than 5%" is something I encountered when I started my alternates some months ago.  To this day it has become quite a different game and I usually end up soloing, 2 boxing or grouping with close friends with these alternates.  Not just because I am powerleveling, quite the contrary I enjoy grouping irregardless of exp or loot.  I do not enjoy grouping over being insulted about equipment or not having uber buffs though.<br />
<br />
Everquest has tackled issues like KEI before and I am glad that they have allowed it as long as they have as most here have I am sure.  Cutting it out now may help the middle game though.  There are a lot of people still in the middle game too!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Yes.  In the same way that XP forces people to group around their own level it would be good if people were forced to depend on Buffs/Heals/Rezzes around their own level too, well within 10 levels anyway.<br />
<br />
If I pick up a Velium Staff at level 6 I get some message about me not being able to control it properly.  It makes sense that the same should apply to KEI and other spells.  "Your mind cannot grasp the enormity of the spell.  The spell fizzles".  This wouldn't stop a 65th level character casting a 14th level buff on a 10th level friend, they just wouldn't be able to give them +1300HP, +57AC, 15 mana regen/tick and a 25pt damage shield.<br />
<br />
The way the game works at the moment, people depend on massive buffs to PL through the low/middle levels.  I think it creates a bad expectation of the way the game works later on.  After reading some posts here I played without KEI and then with vanilla Clarity.  Both worked fine, it was just slower and more of an art.  I couldn't just Stun, Root, Nuke, Nuke, Nuke, Nuke, Root, Nuke, Nuke, Heal, Heal, Heal, Neeeeeeext...<br />
<br />
Realistically, the only reason I want to PL through the mid game is that its not much fun.  The most fun I had recently was standing in PC offering cure diseases.  People were interested in that.  I didn't ask for or get any donations.  It was just nice to have people want my spells.  After a while, a repeat patient asked me to join him and off we went.  Niether of us were twinked and we had a great time.<br />
<br />
I think it would all be in the best interests of a better game experience if KEI and all other high level spells were kept for those of an appropriate level.  What's the point of a 96% Rez on a 20th level Character anyway?  What's the point of a 10% Rez for that matter, why not make the Lvl 19 Rez a 96% Rez for those of an appropriate level?  Wouldn't it be nice if people at 20th level were interested in their neighbourhood 20th level cleric's buffs?</td>

It's about time Sony owned up to this negligence. I don't care if you're offended, it shouldn't be. Level 1 players are not supposed to have over 2k HP. They're supposed to have 30. They aren't supposed to have unlimited mana. They're supposed to learn how to use it effectively.<br />

However, I've buffed my baby wizard with HoV, KEI, FoS, and it's just too much. Baby toons shouldn't be that powerful from just buffs alone. <br />
<br />
People *could* say that about twinking, but honestly I don't see twinking ever being shunned by SOE. They *know* high-end people need a plat-sink, or else there'd be too much plat rotting in banks. In fact, that's happening, even with fully twinked alts. Twinking also doesn't unbalance the low-end game nearly as much as high-end buffs do.</td>

[Haha, best thing was hand of virtue and C5 on my level 20 magician, he could clear mobs in PC better than any group. I would like to see the top level spells buff people down to 46 though. For the reason that many guilds accept visitors or members down to that level and they shouldn't be left out.]<br />
<br />
If the game balanced out the spells a bit all guilds might be interested in having mid or even low level members.  Then it wouldn't be like inviting permanent buff beggars into your private game space.  <br />

I'm a member of an increasingly mid-low level guild.  We don't do raids obviously but we use the guild to group together regularly.<br />

Its on Xev and its called Mystic Swords of Honor if anyone's interested in it for their mid-low level alt.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have mixed feelings about this one.  On the one hand, I like having those buffs available for if I want to make a twink. I have been playing EQ since Kunark and I have leveled quite a few characters through without having the uber buffs. I don't feel any super pressing need to do it yet again. On the other hand I see people who are legit n00bs to the game depending on KEI and not realizing that there IS a certain finess to their class.  I know people will think it is stupid, but personally I want it to stay as it is. My current primary won't suffer if it is changed to even any one of the suggested approaches above, hell none of my charcters will, but  I like knowing it is there if I ever finally get around to making that mage or whatever.</td>

I prefer to play with what I have so that if some higher level character comes through the zone buffing it is a surprise. One minute you have 600hp and the next BAM 2k! And I am going OMG where did THAT come from?!?! WOO HOO I get to be Uuber for a while!! I like to try and stick with my buffs and that of my groupmates, when I am actually grouped with others that is. Usually it is just the two of us. Recently on the Terris-Thule server it has been harder for us poor midlevel clerics to get groups so it is very handy to have a warrior partner with you all the time :D Well I am out for the night it is waaaaayy late here Later all! /zzz /zzz /zzz</td>

Just to see how far I could get one, I made a Pally Frog a while back. I got AEGO and C3 in Nexus at lvl 1. (I know, pallys dont get spells till lvl 8.) then headed to Kurns tower. With a 52 Ranger friend casting thorns and heals on me, I went from 0 exp to 16 in under 2 hours, and have now got him to 24 with under 5 hours played.  Now tell me ubber buffs arent over rated.  Yeah, it was fun to do, just to say I did it, but where is the fun in learning your character?  At lvl 24, I dont know what spells I am even suppose to use on the Pally, and all skills are crap.  Probably going to delete him and start over.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think this is a good idea, there will still be people selling KEI/Aego etc in the nexus and PoK so most of the higher lvls can still get it.  What a shock to someone who just started the game to have a member of their group tell them I don't need your buff I got someone else's. Or Not being able to lvl because they can't get a group because their buffs are no longer needed. <br />
<br />
On a lighter note it will make the life of enchanters, clerics etc easier, because I myself rarely have free time to do some of the stuff I want and being stopped in the Nexus by a lvl 5 Druid wanting KEI or Aego when trying to hurry to the bazaar or bank is sort of frustrating. I don't mind helping others AT ALL, but I think I was lvl 25 on my first character before I had any kind of mana regen at all!  I can still remember the days of "Bard looking for group.........I have the mana song" lol</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Personally I think they should restrict the high end spells to level 46+ simply because as a spell caster now, and having grown up without having these buffs then I learned what spells actually did.  Now a days, when someone forms a group that I can join with my mid level characters, I know I won't have to buff anyone with my puny buffs since they just came from the nexus/PoK/bazaar and got KEI+, BOA+, FOS+, and I have even been in groups for lengthy time having a blast when those buffs start failing, and the group wants to take a 20 minute hiatis just to run back for another fix.  These high end buffs have made it so a low level buffer might get his lvl 1-14 spells, but why even bother with additional spells until you hit 44+ cause you can always find someone to group you and cast a high end group buff for plat.<br />
<br />
I think if they put a required minimum level of 46 for a group buff to stick, like they now do with some items for use, it will restore faith to the lower level casters until they can aquire their ubber buffs at 46.<br />
<br />
The only time I cannot see the change effecting is if someone uses Mass Group Buff to cast the group spell, then that spell should hold on any in the area.  Although many casters take MGB, with the re use timer, it would reduce the ubberness effect on lower levels.  Just my 2cp.<br />
<br />
And yes, I too have played since Kunark, and I play avidly still, as reflected by having 4 accounts spreading out my 12 odd characters ranging from 25 to 65, although I spend the most time on my high end characters mostly now, those are 52 bard(1 fight from his epic), 54 wizzie(transport), 63 chanter, 65 SK, and 65 cleric.</td>

From what I saw on Test, it was limited to level 43 and higher, but that could change when it goes live. It affected group buffs, as well as Mass Group Buffing. It was all spells, so Focus, Brell's, KEI, HoV, BoA, etc.</td>
