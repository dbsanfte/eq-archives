<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Last night I was in a great group in the Dreadlands (50 warrior, 45 warrior, 46 bard, 53 rogue, 46 shaman then cleric and myself). We were set up north of KC and was killing at a fast pace. The group started out with myself and the 50 warrior and we just added more as we fought. He wasn't looting at first, so before the corpse would rot I would loot them. I made sure to allow enough time for him to loot but he preferred to be pulling instead.<br />
<br />
Later when the group existed of the lineup mentioned above, the 45 warrior was looting every kill while it was dropping. At first I didn't mind as it kept the corpses cleared. However I was noticing nobody else was getting a share of the loot (as you know, the splits are minimal compared to the loot that can't be divided from the mob which usually consists of a few pp) including gems and other drops so I sent the guy a tell asking him to ease off and give others a chance. He agreed and for the next few mobs everything was fine. Next thing I know he's back at it looting as mobs are still falling and when the rest of the group is engaged with another mob (that pissed me off seeing him looting while everyone else is getting beat on). So this time I let him know in the group channel and everyone agreed with me. Next thing I know, it was a controlled situation and everyone had a chance to loot and share the riches from this great hunt.<br />
<br />
Ya this is beating the ol' horse, but it really annoys me to see this kind of behavior. Maybe this guy is used to being in groups where nobody says anything. He ended up getting razzed a bit later on by the rest of the group.</td>

I, personally, don't hesitate to send a tell once someone's Ninja-ing tendedncies are revealed.  The truly selfish ones automatically reveal themselves by saying, "Well, split is on, what are you worried about?"<br />

Few minutes later another diamond drops and we all roll again and the shaman wins. I voice my opinion about letting everyone get a nice item then you can win again but he won't here of it "no one said that before hand!" One other person agreed with me the other 4 just stayed quiet. <br />
<br />
I argued with the shman for a minute then just say "i'm leaving in 10 minutes" Immediatly half the group wants to give me the diamond. Like that will make me stay, all I wanted was some fairness. <br />
<br />
Every planes group I've been in has looted this way, everyone gets a drop then you can roll for another one. So it's not like I was expecting something strange from the shaman.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">/me agrees wholeheartedly with Numo, Hannorel & Braeaelin<br />

Every group I have played with HAS to have these rules..<br />
1)autosplit on<br />
2)A rotational Looting of those who want to loot. (some of our members are content with autosplit earnings)<br />
3)Items dropped go to those who NEED/can use first.(if more than one, Only they roll)<br />
4)Random rolls for all other items with Winner dropping out until rotation is complete.<br />
<br />
Thats the way our Guild hunts.For Example: It makes absolutely NO sence for a Necro to loot a piece of Corroded plate in Kael when there are Warriors and Clerics in the guild that can use it. Anybody who claimed that they "Wanted to MQ it" for plat wouldnt fit in our guild for long while Guildmates could put the item to good use in strengthening themselves and our guild as a whole.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I agree with Keyera. Master looting is by far the best method. Autosplit always favors the main looter fairly substantially. For classes/races with low str, it can lead to quick encumberance too.  It is better to have a trustworthy high str. type do the main loot, sell, and split evenly. I realize this is not always practical, but generally, it is the best method. This is what we do, though i tend to hunt with the same people regularly.</td>

Trust is usually something that has to be earned and there is always someone out there that tries to take advantage of others:(. I'll have to give it a try anyways just to see other's reactions. I'll volunteer myself because I'm usually on my drogmor where weight restriction isn't an issue (as greedy as that sounds ;)).</td>

and youre right, he hasnt been much of a friend lately, and i'm just not sure how to deal with this. i've known him since 1st grade and we've had ups and downs, but we always ended up on good terms. in 6th grade i did a social faux pas and i yelled at a popularkids and litterlay lost all my friends but him and another. and in 8th grade i went through some surgeries induced by whom i considered a friend at the time and ended up realizing that all the friends i had made in the last two years like the kid who put me into surgery better, he was there for me again. but this past year (9th grade) he's been becoming more and mroe of an asshole and i'm not too sure what to do. <shrugs> i know this doesnt really belong on a cleric message board and if it did not this topic, but eh, i'm depresed right now and i dont care</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hey Battering sorry to hear you are having trouble with your friends.  It wasnt that long ago I was 15 and its a tough time.  It sounds like he's taking his frustrations etc out on you because he knows you will forgive him as a friend.  You should let him know you he's being a total ass.  Sometimes we dont realize it and sometimes we just dont care when we are, but maybe if you put it to him straight he will.  Any way just my thoughts having been there.  I've lost friends before, but dont worry you will make new ones, and sometimes when people grow up (which is what your friend needs to do) you can go back to being friends. Hope all goes well<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">A great tactic I use on groups that have ninja looters is very simple, it goes like this:<br />
<br />
I give said ninja a few loots.. see how serious he/she is about ninja'ing.  When I'm satisfied that I won't be getting any loot, I proceed to watch the mob's hitpoints.  As it's getting close to dead, I start hammering my LOOT hotkey (yes i have one made for just such occasions".  As soon as I get the loot rights, I say "ninja!!" in group say<br />
<br />
I do that a few times in a row, they usually get the point, and my friends get a good laugh at it :)<br />
<br />
Try it sometime, it's really fun LOL</td>

<br />
Ninja looters...you are a cleric with the power of life and death, they will understand dying (maybe first time offenders deserve a warning first..."you understand, of course, that my heal macro gets bugged by ninja looting, and may not reliably target you"). Letting ninja's get away with it is a disservice to the ninja and the EQ community.<br />
<br />
Cleric Master Loot...I am sure everyone here is honest, but I started my own cleric because you could not trust the master looters on my server....about 30-40% dishonest, don't be surprised if you catch a little static...and do us all a favor, cover your component costs, be truthful about what you are doing, and then be extremely honest with the split afterwards.<br />
<br />
Friend in Jerk Mode...if you are his friend, you owe him a bit of honesty, being quiet is doing you and him a disservice. (see ninja looter above)<br />
<br />
Ok, maybe not quite worth 2cp.<br />
<br />
History Lesson:<br />
<br />
Ninja looting originally meant sneaking up (like a ninja) and looting a person/groups bodies before they got to them. Its evolved into meaning any unfair looting. Just like KSing used to mean letting someone else soften up a mob and moving to get the kill and the exp with a nuke or a charm. Now it means taking a mob once someone else has gotten aggro.</td>

There are some that I group with I know I will not get anything and others the mobs rot, because I forget to loot them.  If I am master looting and the group breaks up all at once, the planes being as they are I will suggest we all zone out, I go sell and do a split. If the others are staying I will give the ones that didn't get any loot some of the stuff that I looted. <br />

well i started out by suggesting that i ML. he spoke up oh man greedy clerics i hate that.<br />
I explained that on my first character i played a bard and was bugged by seeing greed, so to go ahead , everyone would get their fair share. gems etc drop , playing wraps up and i do the split.<br />
<br />
i explained real fast that i was covering my dot costs with X gems, then proceed to hand everyone a gem + the bum jewlery that drops. asked if everyone was happy, they all said wow, yea!<br />
<br />
after dot costs, i felt that everyone get a fair share and no one complained.<br />
<br />
in short, explain what you want to do and see if everyone agrees. ( even had the ninja hand me a gem he looted from his leet ninja skills :) )</td>
