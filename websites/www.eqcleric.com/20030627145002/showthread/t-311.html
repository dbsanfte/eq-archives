<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hey everyone I was just wondering about a few things and I don't have any frinds in RL that play nor do I reallly know anyone in the game enough to start buggin them with this nonsense. (this will probably be a long post)<br />
      The other day I was hanging out by myself when someone asks me if I would want to group up..so I say fine and for the next two hours we just go to town and take out anything on screen.  Now for the last two hours all I have been really paying attention to is healing, casting damage spells on the undead and regaining mana, while (s)he has been fighting and doing the subsequent looting, which is mostly low level gems like pearls and bronze and fine steel weapons(not all that bad for lvl 25-27)  I really don't care because I am already emcumbered and we are autospliting the money, so at least i am getting someting.  But the problem arises later when more guys join group and we head off to the harder parts of the zone.  Right before we start fighting  the guy I orginally grouped with says that he gets all gems because he is too overweight for anything else..no one responds or argrees and we head off.  No more than 5 minutes later all hell breaks out because a gem dropped and the other guy in the group looted it. Well my original partner goes off and starts yelling at him that its his because he called it, and eventually disbands and leaves after being told that he can get the gem if he beats him in the roll.  Then the tells start coming to me to disband, to which I tell him "no i think you are wrong and, by the way, you didnt hear me complaning when you took about 20-30 pp off the corpeses from our group." After this, he tells me that I am a moron blah blah blah and i should go to hell.  I don't get the chance to group that often but it seems to me that too many people are too greedy in the game....they seems to think that everquest money is no different than real money and they need to hoard as much as possible so they can become the all time everquest king or queen.  I think that I spend enough time out of the game working for REAL money and don't want to spend the 3-4 hours a week PLAYING a game and worring about FAKE money.  Any of you have these problems and if so do you think that the guy who looted the gem was supposed to give it up because someone called for it depite the fact that he has already looted close to 40pp of items and can easily afford a stack of the gems? Also what could happen if I would of sent a profanity riddled tell back to him because he really deserved it. I imagine that they view this as a family type game and would probably boot me for it??<br />
 This is too long aleady i will put the next questions about RP and specializaton in another post..thanks to anyone who responds</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">He was a selfish, loot hogging, immiture even for his age kid! He should have at a minimum offered you some of the loots when you were just partnered. Once you were grouped, everyone should have gotten loot. Once he made his stupid CLAIM to all the gems, you should have disbanded and left him sitting in the dirt begging for scraps.  Being a group leader does not mean he is dictator for life!<br />
<br />
Please dont take his self centered attitude as the norm for the game.  It has been my experience that clerics get forgotten when looting because you are medding, so dont be afraid to ask for the ocassional FS drop, or any component drops you need. Chanter/mages/necro's all ask for page/words/runes as they need them for research. <br />
<br />
Also, most experienced players, especially tanks, know which gems you need and offer them strait up as soon as they loot them.  They want you medding to keep thier blood from getting low!<br />
<br />
Oh, the only exception is if someone in the group is hunting a SPECIFIC gem for a quest or something, not just claiming any gem because he was over weight.</td>

<br />
if you are going to ever be able to aford being a cleric, there has to be a master looter, period. and it is best if it is you. when someone uses auto split, the whole rest of the group gets cheated, it would be ok if the game split everything equal, but it dont. if the mob drops 3pp, 12gp,6sp, 12cp.. the one who loots gets 3pp, 2gp, 1sp, 2cp... while you all get the same, except no pp!!!! <br />
<br />
what i always do, is ML then before anyone leaves the group, do a quick split first. then at the end of the night, ask if they want me to go sell and split after, well most of the time there is no vendor near so you get to keep all the vendor trash. if you do happen to go sell all the loot and they want a split of it, make sure you keep out your costs FIRST!!! then split it. let the group know you do this, so then maybe, if you group with them in the future, they might get the hint that those symbols are not free to you!<br />
<br />
my poin, ALWAYS have a ML, perferably make it you!!!!!!<br />

<br />
Do these not exist anymore?<br />
<br />
Alpha looting meant you guy by name in turn you loot a kill,<br />
what you get from that mob is what you get.<br />
<br />
Honor looting meant anyone can loot any mob and keep what was on it.. but if someone in the group spoke up for a piece it was usually given to them.<br />

be creative in dealing with loot issues.. dont' make it So important that the fun of the group itself is lost. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I always make a point of explaining to my group how I do loot, which is as follows: There is one ML - often but not necessarily me. Noone besides ML loots and before the group breaks up, the ML sells all loot and reimbuses clerics, enchanters, magicians, necros and all others who have had expenses during the grouping session. Then we split the rest. Evenly and exactly so all get their fair share.<br />
<br />
People have been angry at clerics long enough for being greedy about gem drops (especially in places like Sebilis), and it's about time we do our best to turn around the opinion.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I agree that clerics should be able to recover gem costss wen they are grouping. However as a fellow enchantress I really hope that other enchanters aren't running around tossing Rune IV on everyone they group with or something like that. The difference between our Rune line and your symbol line is this. You have increased your max hp for a set duration of time with symbol. Rune is just a damage shield. a 300hp damage shield could drop in 3-4 hits in lvl 50 zones and there goes your peridot. As a chanter, if I had to keep wizzies and clerics runed all day long, I would be running around naked.<br />
<br />
So in other words regent cost coverage is MUCH MORE important to clerics than to chanters. However if you wanna group with me and give me all the money I won't complain :D<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have never been a big looter and sure have paid for it over the long run in this game.  There is nothing for me to learn to be a more aggressive looter, it is just my nature.  Still I have been in the poorhouse more often than not because of my nature and it has made me proud to have never changed my ways.  I enjoy being known as a fair helpful individual.  I know I have been taken advantage of many times, but this is my game and does not bother me.<br />
<br />
I generally spend 20 to 100pp a session in groups on gems, and have recently become more aggressive in being compensated.  It has become more important because there are zones that the loot is horrible, and a cleric can go through a lot of cash just on gems.<br />
<br />
The cost of our cleric reagents has always been an issue, but think of the power we bestow by their use (HP benefits.)  The newer spells that offer group buffs alleviate the cost somewhat, but I for one still believe our reagents cost too much!  Not every cleric is comfortably entrenched behind a wealthy guild.  Even a somewhat lengthy raid can use up quite a few peridots.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">When you play as early lvls, (1-20) It's ok to just have auto split and do some looting order. But for higher lvl places I think that there should be a ML, prferably a druid, cleric or shaman. This provides much easier way of getting through battles and any gems or stuff that is tradeable u keep till the end and eitehr give it to the person, or like Jarvis said, roll for it if more than one needs it. It also helps if you're the ML because like everyone stated, our reagents cost a LOT. I mean, i normally like to carry around like 200pp on me, and after one grouping session and reimbursing my reagents, BAM no more pp. But one helpful thing is when you are grouped like a Tank, who gldayly pays you the cost of a reagent for every buff/ symbol etc. you give him. Don't be afraid to loot, but don't let it go to your head.</td>
