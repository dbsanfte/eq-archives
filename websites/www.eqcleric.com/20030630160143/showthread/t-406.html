As for the type of macros I have? It depends on the situation, of course. If I am raiding, then I have /target keys set up for a variety of people, such as the MT and ST, chanter, other cleric, etc. In addition, I have a litany of keys setup for my heals, which range from the ch to the quick heals to the group heals. And, last but not least, I have keys set up for divine barrier/aura.<br />
<br />
For xping (group), I have my heal keys, my "offensive keys" (for bash and the like), and the divine barrier/aura keys. I also have keys setup for my clickable items, such as my BP or whatnot. Lastly, I have a key set up to announce when I am "marking" something. Unnecessary, yeah, but it makes me feel better. :D</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">MT = Main Tank. The main tank is the meat shield that is doing all the taunting. He usually has the highest AC (armor Class) and the most HP (hit Points). He is suppose to keep all the agro so that your job as cleric is much easier. If the MT keeps agro, you dont have to worry so much about wasting mana healing that wizard that casted too many nukes in a row, etc...<br />
<br />
Agro = attention. If you agro a mob, you have his attention, you are put on his HATE list. Usually you get his full, undivided attention if you hold the agro. A tank holds the agro by taunting, kicking and attacking, but whenever someone does any damage to that mob, they move up the hate list. When the tank taunts again, the last agro moves back down the list a little. If someone gets higher on the hate list than the MT, they gain agro, and you get to use extra mana healing them, if you have time. In high level encounters, you might not have time when the mobs are quad hitting for 400-600hp.<br />
<br />
MA = Main Assist. In some groups, you will have someone doing the pulling that is not the main tank. Monks are a prime example of this. Monks are usually not the MT in a group if there is either a Warrior, Paladin, Shadow Knight, or Ranger in the group, but monks make excellent pullers. When they get to camp, everyone uses &#123;/assist MTname} so that all are attacking the same mob. If there is an enchanter in the group, their job will be to "MEZ" or Mesmerize any ADDS or extra mobs that join the one that got pulled. If someone breaks Mez on the mob not being engaged by the group, it can really hurt the group, or get all of them killed. Especially the Chanter. Mez is a VERY BIG agro and puts the chanter at the top of the hate list.<br />

Hey, since you brought it up, I've always been a little confused about the difference between the terms MT (main tank) and MA (main assist). I'm not sure I follow how it works. Either the main tank IS the main assist, or the puller is. If the main tank is the main assist, why are there two terms for him? He's just the main tank. If the puller is the main assist, then why is he called that if no one ever "assists" him?</td>

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Your MT can be the MA, but, normally the puller (when not the MT) is the MA. That way every one targets the same mob. If the puller come running in to camp with 3 mobs on his tail, it is much easier for the MT to /assist puller than to have to try to click thru the inc targets to get the one origionally pulled. On a raid, the MA might be the raid leader also (have seen that once in 12 raids). It is also the MA's responsibility to make sure everyone is taking down the mob's in the order needed. <br />
<br />
There are many different ways to use this as well. The MT might have the puller set as the MA, while everyone else in the group assists of the MT.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are in a really good exp group, your puller will be leaving when the mob is at 15% hp unless the healer calls med. In that case, assisting off the MT would be everyone except the puller's best option.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: This is my interpretation. It is not a hard and fast rule anywhere.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">as far as some of those macro's go, i would do away with any that make you sit, or stand, or pause. (being in a CH rotation is different)<br />
<br />
what if you press it, and your standing? akk ya sit, and no heal. also sitting right after a complete heal is not a very good thing to do, a complete heal + sit makes mob want to bonk you. same thing if you have pauses in there, what if ya do a CH, then have the /pause 100 then all of sudden your ench is going down? your screwed cause you have to wait for pause to get over.<br />
<br />
only thing i have macroed is:<br />
<br />
for each heal<br />
<br />
/cast "whatever gem slot it is"<br />
<br />
/g incoming "insert heal name here" fo %t<br />
<br />
/cast "whatever gem slot it is"<br />
<br />
i have that macro for 4 different heals, and in each i do the /cast thing twice to catch fizzles.<br />
<br />
then if is a raid, i also have my MA and SA hotkeys<br />
<br />
they are just:<br />
<br />
MA<br />
<br />
/target "MA name here"<br />
<br />
SA<br />
<br />
/target "SA name here"<br />
<br />
<br />
all my macros are simple and to the point, no need to spam everyone with a bunch of text, it is cool to have all that fancy text the first couple times ya see it, but to have it everytime you heal, for a couple hours in a camp? bahhhh lol<br />

anyway this IMO your milege may very......<br />

Tie your movement keys to a hot key and put sence heading on each hot key page in the same slot. <br />

click options -> keyboard<br />
select macros -> click on Hot button Number (alternate)<br />
then hit what ever key you use to go left or right<br />

This will make it so that anytime you go left or right you use the sence heading key.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I keep my macros short and sweet. Considering most of the time im on a horse, sitting isnt a big deal, and the whole accidental sitting idea steered me clear of making that part of my macros when i first started the clericy proffession. My first panel of macros looks like this:<br />
<br />
(1)<br />
Complete heal<br />
/cast 1<br />
Complete heal inc to %T(Target) in 10 seconds--- Hang in there!<br />
<br />
(2)<br />
Divine Light<br />
/cast 2<br />
Special mana drain just for %T!<br />
<br />
(3)<br />
the Sit key, taken from the actions window, because it changes from sit to stand depending on if you are standing or sitting. I did this because its easily accessable, and i now have it across all my caster chars (Once used it on my ranger, but realized it was too deeply ingrained in my memory when i sat down trying to fight Black Reavers)<br />
<br />
(4) <br />
Remedy AKA Caster heal<br />
/cast 3<br />
A kiss for your boo boo, %T<br />
<br />
(5) <br />
/cast 4<br />
Celestial heal or Nuke, as the situation calls<br />
<br />
<br />
(6) Usually just a spell gem, rather than a macro, as this is where my heals end and i have a nuke, buff or summon hammer spell here for easy access<br />
<br />
I have reassigned my target group member keys to the<br />
Home/End/Delete/Page up/Page down/ Insert bank of keys on my keyboard, so my right hand can be targeting the right group member while my left hand uses the first 6 of my macro keys (Traditionally 1-6 on your keyboard) to heal,nuke etc. The last 4 in my UI are used for (7) Random nuke/buff<br />
(8) horse bridle for easy clicking (9) Divine Aura and (10) root (Translates to 0 when bound to keys) <br />
Since the bottom four arent used as often, but are handy to have around, its not a big deal that their on my "off hand" side of the macros bank of keys.<br />
I also use a different bank of macros with the same set up but different messages for raids. No one wants to see my "kisses for you boo boo" message in their raid window, so i just do /rsay Incoming Remedy to %t, and things like that, but otherwise the same exact set up as my grouping bank.</td>

There is no room for error if you use /stand instead of /sit off.  I do the sitting part on my own because there is nothing like casting a heal, getting agro, then sitting down while being beaten. From most of my experience, you take about double average damage if hit while sitting.</td>

At the time /stand was not in the game yet. so I had to use /sit off to include in the macro. Go us old schoolers :p Truth be told I did not even know /stand had been added. /rolleyes  The game is alot nicer on the lower level player now than when I first started I mean you die and still have all your equipment left No CR in LFay at level2 Lost all the nice twink gear the guys that got me startede gave me. A bard bought me a Helm to go on the CR I could not believe He spent 10PP On it I mean WOW 10PP Boy how times have changed I destroy more than that in copper and Silver most of the time.

Complete Heal<br />

the complete heal hotkey gets channels added to it when in a raid and I too have the /cast 1 again in case of fizzles.  great thing to have :)<br />
<br />
*edit* after reading the replies after my post I thought I would clarify my post as well.  I too have to be in a guild cleric channel so it normally goes<br />
<br />
/cast 1<br />
/2 Inc CH on <name> - guild cleric channel<br />
/g Inc CH on <name><br />
/rs Inc CH on <name> - for when in raids<br />
/1 Inc CH on <name> - normal guild raid channel<br />
/cast 1<br />
<br />
by the time that whole thing recycles with the channels and such its almost perfect on the timing.  I take out the /1 for normal grouping situations.  I've rarely had both CH's fizzle but this set up has saved me a few times where the normal raid spam I didnt catch that the first CH fizzled.</td>

in my privious post i left out the part about saying it in raid, and in cleric chanel as well, i do that too, lol all us clerics in guild are required to be in cleric chanel at all times. it is auto logg in, is funny, we of exping apart, and we can tell when a fellow clerics group is in truble, "supernal exlixer for so and so...inc...supernal elixer inc for so and so...supernal elixer inc for target" oops!! death.<br />

forgot to add that i hav to set it up a bit diff or the message won't go to both chanels, i had as the above poster has, but it seems sometimes it will only go to first chanel, and give me the you can't do that while casting message, but ever since i put the two /cast 4 before second line of chat, it works perfect.<br />

with that, and normal chat set to raid, it says it in raid, and in cleric chanel, in a complete heal rotation i also have to add: so and so your next!!!</td>

I too have started to use macros for casting. This is a smart way to play I think. It keeps everyone informed and also keeps me, as a healer, more alert. There are more than just heals that can be good information for the group to know. For instance, (ok, strange situation, but you group with who you can get...) I was grouped in DSP last night and a rogue was our tank (yep, a rogue. The group was me, a wizzy and a rogue). So I created a macro for my stun so that the rogue would know when a potential backstab opportunity was coming up. <br />
<br />
I have seen people use /say, and I've seen people use /g. I prefer /g because it shows up in the "group" color as opposed to it being mistaken for some chatty lumpkin standing nearby. Also, I don't want to necessarily spam nearby groups in places where it's crowded. The only drawback is when a higher level toon is helping you, and is not grouped for XPing purposes. We had a higher lvl druid who was pulling for this group, and he dropped several heals on top of mine thinking I wasn't going to get it off in time ("Step off Mr. Drood! Healing is MY territory!"). Anyway, that's the only downside I know about.<br />
<br />
Also, the Function keys are wonderful for targeting group members. Get to know them. They are your friend. You don't have to worry about crappy framerates making your cursor slow or targeting people in a crowd...heck, you don't even have to be facing the battle to target and heal your party member. I hear some exclusively play with their back turned to the action!<br />
<br />
Anyway, too much information in my opinion is better than too little.<br />
