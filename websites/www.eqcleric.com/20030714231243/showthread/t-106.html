As far as chanters giving you your 5pp back for KEI... 2 things.<br />
1) WTF do you need KEI for at lvl 12? Do without.<br />
2) Giving a chanter 5pp for casting a spell which takes up 900 mana on you is an insult. If you're going to donate, donate 50pp or more. If you don't have that kind of pp, then don't get KEI. But using some good-hearted chanter for KEI and then insulting them with a 5pp "donation" is a slap in the face; it takes a 60 chanter about 10 seconds to loot 5pp off a mob, and it takes them a LOT longer to regen 1/3 of their mana bar.<br />

I don't normally pay the tank for pulling or anyone else for their benifical spells.  I also do not accept donations.  As a front line battle priest, it is kinda my job, to assist those in need without expectation of monies.  <br />
<br />
Through out this world of Norath, we all benifit for what the other offers.  It will become more apparent in your later seasons.  As a follower of Tunare, I feel it is my duty to assist those in need.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">as to needing KEI i should explain this<br />
<br />
according to murphys law, i always get stuck in groups with stupid people that dont understand "WAIT I NEED MORE MANA" or "USE HARMONY FIRST!" so when i play battering (who is my main now) i find myself needing to heal atleats 60hp quickly when my spell only does 30. KEI helps with this. it boosts my wis, which i would pay for alone at this point and gives me the second fastest mana regen in the game. I've played a Chanter for a long time and know how under appreciated of a class it is. So when they say CASTING KEI FOR DONATIONS, i do do my darnedest to give them what i can. In fact untill yesterday when i sold a sword for 1k for my friend, i had never seen more than about 50pp. That explains my feelbe attempt to donate to the chanters. I also realize how that when some one dies, their scapegoat is of corse the healer. Even if its not our fault i often hear and ahve a few times said "WTH WHERE YOU DOING? I HAD LIKE 2HP LEFT YOU F*** A$$ HOLE!!" With kei i can cast a 30hp heal constantly as soon as i recover and have often brought people back from being unconscious sever times in the same 30 seconds. That is why I need kei and why i donate so little. I know how much it sucks being a chanter and how much appreacation they need and that is why i do donate what i can even when its under 10pp. <br />
<br />

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'd like to adress two of the comments made above... <br />
<br />
First, casting KEI does not consume 1/3 of a level 60 Enchanter's mana pool, unless they are SEVERELY under-equipped.  If an enchanter had 2700mana at level 60, they would not be in a guild capable of obtaining the KEI scroll, nor would they have money to spare to purchase the scroll, as they should be purchasing non-newbie equipment.  In addition, most intelligent enchanters specialize in Alteration, and thus the mana cost would be even less.  <br />
<br />
Second, it is a very bad idea to get into the habit of chain-healing.  You do not need KEI at level 12.  You do not NEED KEI at level 60.  What you need to do is learn to manage your mana pool efficiently.  Don't worry about melee overpulling.  If you have warned them, let them die.  They will learn soon enough.  Eventually level will catch up with you, and KEI will not save you if you have not taken the time to learn how to play a cleric appropriately.<br />
<br />
And, as a previous poster said, 5pp is more of an insult than a donation.  Nothing aggravates me more than someone asking to buy a service, then showing how little they value my time.  This is why I do not respond to any /tells, or /ooc unless someone comes right out and says what they are willing to pay.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Level 12 Templar, LOL!  If you are making a cleric to make money, stop now.  Make a chanter instead and get to 60 asap.  No other character can stand around in Nexus half afk and make SO much money.  I have seen a chanter friend make 1k in 20 minutes getting 100pp from each person, grouping them, and casting KEI.  <br />
<br />
So don't expect much from your rezzes, and by the time you get 100pp for a rez, believe me it will be all you can do to keep that out of the dot fund.  <br />
<br />
Aego costs me 10p 5g to cast for singles, 42pp for groups, and although OCCAISIONALLY someone comes up to me and hands me a dot or 20pp for Aego, I have never been paid 100pp for a group Aego cast, ever.  Not even 142pp, which would be 100pp for the 2000mana cast and 42 to cover the components.  KEI is only 900 mana, and my Aego stays on just shy of 3 hrs with my current gear and AA's.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, your job is to heal, and until you get some decent wis and mana gear expect to be OOM basically your entire career.  Think of it as job security :)</td>

Druids get paid for sow and port, wizards get paid for xloc, chanters get paid for clarity, mages get paid for focus items.  But when a cleric wants a small donation to save a trip across 6 zones and a lot of time fighting, it seems like he's speaking in some foreign language.<br />
<br />
And I have to agree that no one *needs* KEI.  It's nice to be able to fight non-stop for 2+ hours, plus throw in some nukes for a change, but it's certainly not needed.  As for the 5pp being returned, if someone offers a clarity and I don't have a respectable donation and am nowhere near a bank, I usually keep a Rose of Firiona or some thoughtful item in my backpack that I give in return.</td>

This is the reason I always pay, and I do not randomly resurrect/TL people whenever they ask.

<br />
I think this is a great concept, and so far I've lived up to it myself. When the guild handed down the Emerald Dragonscale Tunic to me, I handed my Sebilite Scale Coat to a fellow cleric in the guild.<br />
<br />
The Seb tunic I had bought myself in my early 20's, but rather than sell it for a fraction of what I once paid, it made mroe sense to give to to someone who was in dire need of an upgrade.<br />
<br />
When I get my Templar's Breastplate I plan to hand the Emerald Dragonscale Tunic to another cleric in dire need. Of course this particular example is more related to guild than anything else, but this is what I'll be doing with all my non-NODROP items I have as they get upgraded.<br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed since I received my clickstick is that I rez people for free (runby rez) a lot more than before. I usually didn't have rez memmed when running A to B for instance, as I needed Root, etc etc...<br />
<br />
Now that's not an issue, and I can rez people without even using mana... Only makes sense to me to pay it forward for all the cleric help I got myself growing up. I feel a certain responsibility to other players below me in game, to help if I can. It is a game built on human interaction and intervention. If I can help a guy who's been trying to get a rez for the past hour and then reject a payment, that's a good feeling :)</td>

Back to the res discussion.  Yes, we all could use more money, but the idea of charging to cast a spell that doesn't cost a reagent seems very greedy to me.  If it's out of your way, or you're busy, then don't do it.  If you do cast it, then that was your choice.  My policy has always been to accept it when it's offered, but to never ask.  Like most of you, I've gone WAY out of my way for complete strangers, I've resed them, and more often than not.... I don't even get a thank you.  I don't do that very much anymore.<br />

While I strongly agree with the basic idea of your post Krystanie, that being there are too many people who used uber buffs all their lives and don't know how to play their characters, I don't think you've identified the correct cause of the problem.  The issue isn't the players SELLING the buffs, it's the ones BUYING them.  <br />
<br />
Do you really think people don't ask a lvl 60 enchanter for KEI just because she isn't auctioning to cast for donations?  Or a lvl 60 cleric for Ageo?  Whenever I go anywhere I have buff beggars sending me tells...hello /roleplay.  <br />
<br />
If anything, charging for those buffs instead of giving them away reduces the number of low level people to whom these buffs are actually available.  I know this doesn't stop the twinks, but NOTHING can stop the twinks!  <br />

I agree with Embrael, we've all been there. I think its cute when they try to give me the 5pp that they have cuz they are so happy that someone helped them. I smile cancel the trade and tell them to buy something nice for themselves. Or, I'll sneak in 100pp  or so that i have on me so they make pp ;). I've 9 out of 10 rezes lost money doing the rez, cuz they get rezed, healed, and buffed including my best regent costing spell. I don't mind doing it and i love helping those that need the help. The people that can afford the donate i'll accept. Guild members, group members, friends of friends, people that i've seen run past me before, they all get free rezes. <br />

About the whole epidemic thing, yeah today everything is about money anymore. If you don't see it walk in the bazaar, join the bazaar channel or sit in PoK for a while. People don't have to do their epics anymore. If they have enough money they can find someone to multi-quest it. I hate the idea of multi-questing. I don't think its honest. My bf said something about paying to multi-quest my epic and I'd rather not get it at all. People don't do quests at all anymore. You can go to the bazaar and pick up an item thats better than the questable one. The game has just gotten easier, you don't have to work anymore to get what u want. Yeah, I'll pay for a KEI. no I don't need one and I'd rather do without, but sometimes with the groups i'm in, having a KEI comforts me. I pay well for KEI's when i get them. And ports, i pay pretty well for those, if I search you out to do something for me i don't expect u to do it for free. <br />

On the humorous side someone in my guild wanted me to help him start a cleric because he wanted to make money. After i stopped laughing my as off i corrected his horrible mistake and suggested he try another class for money making bliss.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Earlier this week I was in LoIO I was grouped with a monk guild friend of mine, we were fighting undead at the skele hut.  An enchanter sends me a tell asking if I would mind rezzing him.  I didn't reply right away cause we were fighting and I was a tad busy.  He sends me another tell before I get to reply saying that he will gladly donate 35p.  Now, I'm only level 25, and someone willing to donate 35p for the rez I can offer is obviously NOT looking forward to the run back to their corpse.  Either that or this person has run into problems where people refused to buff/heal/teleport/translocate/rez without a donation (notice I said *people* not Clerics specifically, I think people sometimes are afraid to ask for help in general for fear of people being rude to them).  At any rate.  I refused the donation, rezzed him, and he ended up joining our group.  It was a lot of fun and we've grouped a couple times since then.  I know if I am ever LFG and he's got a spot he'll have an open invite for me, and likewise for him.<br />

This is mostly directed to the original poster, sort of as a lesson.  Sometimes the few minutes you take out of your time to help someone out can come back to be a blessing for you.</td>
