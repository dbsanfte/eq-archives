<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">ok, last night I got into an EXCELLENT XP group in MSeru and managed to get a full level (Yay me! Ding 23! :) )<br />
<br />
2 wizards, a berserker a ranger and a paladin started off the group and we tore through mobs. <br />
<br />
I have a few questions though:<br />
<br />
 the Healing over time spells, while they take a good chunk of mana, the Celestial Remedy healed a lot more than my healing spell - does it also generate appropriately more hate or would I be better off tossing a few Heals on?<br />
<br />
I think I did a fairly good job of managing healing agro - only got bopped once in over about an hour of fighting, but the mobs were dying quite quickly so I don't know if they had time enough to hate me enough to come try and tear my arms off.<br />
<br />
is it a good idea to keep symbol on everyone or just the MT, myself and the enchanter (if one) while keeping the non-component HP buffs on everyone else?<br />
<br />
I currently have 2 +6 wis rings, would it be better to drop one of them in favor of a Moonstone ring with the extended range on there? (current wis is 222) <br />
<br />
And would a book of Obulus (provided I can find and afford one) be a worthwhile investment for me at 23 or is there something else that can increase the amount of HPs I heal per cast?<br />
<br />
Then later on, group members started leaving :( and I was made leader.  I got some Leadership experience...is there a place I can see how much I have and what does it do for me or the group?  (I'm betting I missed a URL that explains this...)<br />
<br />

Thank you in advance :)</td>

<br />
I rarely symbol anyone other than the Enchanter.  I don't draw agro often enough (as my Defense of 34 will prove) to worry about it, and if I am slow enough on the heals, the extra HP won't really save the tanks.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the gear thing.  I'm working on saving for a Book of Obulus myself.  I can't see how it would hurt to have one, if you can find it.</td>

<br />
HoT's actually generate MORE agro, however, they generate it over a period of time.  Thus allowing the melee to keep ahead of it.  As the melee fight and build "hate", unless under extreme circumstances, they will almost always generate enough "hate" to keep the mob from making a bee-line towards you.<br />
<br />
I find these days that most people come into a group already buffed (but not always).  I was a young again, I would "help" people learn agro management by only casting HP buffs on the tank and a chanter (if you have one), and yourself of course.<br />
<br />
As far as the moonstone ring, unless you are fighting in areas where the mobs cast AE's (Guk, Dalnir's.. etc) I don't forsee them doing enough for you to warrent replacing the 6wisdom rings.  Although, extra distance can be helpful.<br />
<br />
Cannot comment about the low level improved healing items :(<br />
<br />
While in game.. press the "L" key :)<br />
<br />
*side note* Enju, seriously, work on those defensive skills.  You WILL hurt later, if you don't.</td>

<br />
No.  Heal over time spells generate less hate than direct heals, and at your level are more mana-efficient.<br />
<br />
Don't get too addicted to heal over time spells, though.  As you level up, more and more often you encounter situations where you've got to heal a lot of hp NOW and deal with the consequences later... taking aggro is not always bad, and you need to maximize your defence skill at every level.  You'll thank me for that advice later.  ;)<br />

<br />
AT LEVEL 23 don't symbol anyone who doesn't need it.  As you rise in levels, you'll find that everyone needs a cleric hp buff eventually, but for the moment, hang onto your gems.<br />

<br />
Definitely.<br />
<br />
Never mind the Extended Range... the moonstone ring gives +30 mana.  At your present level, that's as much as you'd get from wearing a +15 wis ring.<br />
<br />
All you need at 23 is 200 WIS, and less than that would be fine too (I was at about 140 WIS when I was level 23).  200 WIS is the "soft cap" beyond which there are very diminishing returns for having any higher.  Look for items with direct +hp and +mana on them in preference to +WIS and +STA - one of the best is the jewelcrafted 65hp/65mana necklace.<br />

<br />
Focus items are good.  For a level 23, get them in this order:  Mana Preservation II (most important); Improved Healing II (less important); everything else (hardly matters at all.)<br />

<br />
From the default UI, press "L" for an explanation.  At level 23, though, I'd say you want to turn this off and keep it switched off until you're in your 50's or 60's.<br />

I rarely symbol anyone other than the Enchanter.  I don't draw agro often enough <b>(as my Defense of 34 will prove)</b> to worry about it, and if I am slow enough on the heals, the extra HP won't really save the tanks.</td></tr></table> <br />
<br />
Enju Enju Enju.  At 39, your Defense should be 195.  Your AC when you're nakies should be over 500 now.  Find a 39+ mage, necro or BL and duel their lvl 39 pet for a while, k?  Don't go to PoP until your Defense is a lot better.<br />
<br />
I can't figure out why you think tanks don't need symbol.  At lvl 39, you've got a Pinzarn that's giving the tank around 300 extra HP.  How can that not make a difference?<br />
<br />
The tank, as well as the chanter, should always have your best buffs, and if you've got a necro in the group, symbol on the necro isn't a bad idea either (since hp = mana for them, they'll love you for it).  I almost always use component-free buffs on myself while exp'ing, unless I'm somewhere that the mobs hit hard (like PoP).  But don't neglect the tank.<br />

Dustscryer's Crystal Ball<br />
Fine Antique Ring (<a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16371" target="_blank">PoK quest</a>, quest items are tradable and can often be bought in the bazaar)</td>

I recommend doing the Fine Antique Ring quest for Mana Preservation II, it's a really easy and fairly inexpensive quest for a very good focus effect. Go with the Moonstone Ring for the other ring slot.<br />

If you get an Improved Healing II spell, use Greater Heal over your current HoT when you get it. Likewise use Superior Healing over your level 29 HoT when that comes along. (as a main heal that is, of course on big pulls you'll want to lead with a HoT).</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">HoTs own - learn to use them and love them.  Yes they generate less agro.  As to getting your defense up I found this pretty easy.  Solo light blue or dark blue mobs in the old world.  Get in there and swing that mace, club or hammer when the mobs get down to about 30 or 35%.  You will get in a few hits  and take some hits but mob will likely drop before you get killed from them.  Your offense and defense skills will go up.  This is also a good time to start learning when the appropriate time is to hit your DA and DB keys.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe it is just my style, but once I got into the Pop zones I found myself regulary throwing an HoT on incoming on the MA.  Really helps mitigate the big drop in hp until the mob gets slowed.  Then if slow gets resisted be ready to throw the fast heal.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'm going to jump on the "get your defense up now bandwagon".  You can only get skill ups from mobs that are blue to you.  The more you level, the harder blue mobs will hit.   Defense gives you an AC bonus, the lower your AC, the more damage the mobs will do to you, thus making it even more difficult for you to skill up in defense. It's a nasty cycle. <br />
<br />
If you try some zone line skilling up, not having a hammer will make no difference at all.  Although if you want to try to get your 1hb skill up, just summon the lowest summoned hammer and beat on them.  When your health is at 20% zone out and heal yourself.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Don't wait too long.  The longer you wait, the harder it's going to be.  If the orc camp thing really works, do that -- it's certainly worth giving a try.<br />
<br />
Besides, you don't need to buy a weapon to switch into your primary.  Just use your summoned Hammer of Striking (or Hammer of Requital at 44).  It's not a fabulous weapon, but it gets the job done.<br />
<br />
edit: What Dulcinea says is absolutely correct.<br />
<br />
I think those of us being the most emphatic about this are the ones who have been there.  My first cleric got to lvl 40 with a Defense of about 80.  I was able to convince a friend with a mage to duel her Defense up to 200 in two sessions, but it was *painfully* boring for both of us.  Really, you want to do this now while blue mobs don't hit so hard.  I let my druid's Defense get behind, and it hurt to get it back up when she was in her 40's, but it can be done.  With her, I rooted the mob, let it beat on her, backed up and healed.  If you can find a druid partner to do this with, so much the better -- if you're SoW'ed and the mob is snared, it's much safer.<br />
<br />
Max'ed Defense gets more and more important as you level and then move into PoP.  1st tier mobs max hit for 250, 350, depending on the zone.  2nd tier mobs hit for 500-ish.  That's why we're suggesting you do this now rather than later.  :)</td>

Thanks for the recomendation.  I may not be 45 or KEI'd up, but it's working perfectly well anyway.  Already picked up 12 points in the last half hour or so.</td>
