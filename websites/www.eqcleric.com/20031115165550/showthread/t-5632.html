Maybe I am missing something...what is the average level Clerics get there Epics at, and why?<br />
<br />
I can see where you obviously do need a decent size guild or group of friends for Chardok, Ixi, etc... but I can't see where level plays a part past 45 or so.<br />
<br />
If I hadn't had Shazz, I would have had to have someone help me with the shards, etc...but Gimpy and Gurgle would have been soloable easy enough at 45.<br />
<br />
So why does everyone who doesn't already know me seem surprised that a level 54 Cleric has their Epic, and go into shock when I tell them I have had it since 51 (and would have had it at 50 except I leveled too darn quick)?</td>

That seems to be the major hang point...and it makes sense, since it isn't exactly a 15 minute fight.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Personally, I was level 60.  At the time, hardly any clerics on the server had their epics before level 60... in fact, when I got my epic, I think I could have listed nearly all the other epic clerics on Xev by name.  ;)<br />
<br />
Overking Bathezid was something we didn't even consider trying unless we had at least thirty people and five clerics.  We used a two-monk pull team with several enchanters on mezz duty, and it was hard going moving through Chardok palace ahead of the respawn.  Despite the huge force being employed, I still wiped out my entire guild five times on successive attempts in Chardok - requiring coffin CR's - before we finally brought down the Overking and I looted my singed scroll.<br />
<br />
Chardok used to be so hard.  But the Ragefire camp, that was truly awful.  I spent well over 300 hours /played just sitting watching Zordak's spawn point, usually with at least one other cleric sitting there with me waiting to call in her guild if he popped.  First in force got the kill...<br />
<br />
Nowadays, we don't even bother to log in our mains for Bathezid.  We can take him with four or five of our twinks, and the same force for Ixi and Rage.<br />
<br />
I have the impression that everybody's twink cleric seems to get her epic about level 51, but that could be seriously inaccurate... in the level 65 game, I very rarely see a cleric without her epic.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The first cleric in our guild who got her epic did not bother til she was 65. She didn't see the point, but we finally talked her into it. We also found out that our small family style guild is quite capable of handling this epic, especially with the help of our guild allies. The Overking is not so bad if you have a CoTH mage with good Chardok faction, and while our guild does not, our ally guild does and has already told me she is willing and able to help me when I am ready for that part of the program.<br />
<br />
I "started" mine at 52, but just finished up to the plasmatic priest at 53. I would like to finish it before I actually GET to 56, just for the kicks and giggles of having the spell before I am "supposed" to. However, since i am also attempting to level up during this time, who knows which I will actually finish first.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I would hardly consider myself someones twink , as I am my only char, but the game is much different now then it was for clerics who started in beta, players are much more powerful at  lower levels, just because there are so many cheap, easy choices for people to gear up and go.<br />
I NEVER could have done my epic alone at 51 but my guild felt it should be a priorty for us to have a cleric with click rez for raiding, so I got a lot of help.... people of ALL classes are getting epics early, just because it has become much easier...no I havent been playing since beta but I have played for 3 years, and it is amazing how much has changed, and frankly, how much of the challenge has gone out of it :(...that being said, I am enjoying my epic and how much it has helped my guild and guild alliance raid team , made things much more enjoyable for all.<br />
Most level 65s I see on Fennin have their epic in bags, since they have stuff so much better, ...things have changed.<br />

I had no luck with any of the camps, between 5 and 14 hours. The Overking we got with a CotH mage. The respawn time is 2 hours, so basically we killed him 3 times, for 3 clerics, instaid of doing another raid. <br />
<br />
By the time I got the epic, I was so sick of camps and raids (of course I was going to raids for al the other guildies who helped me with mine), that I stopped playing for 5 or 6 months. Now  I love having the epic. I could have been 65 in the time it took  me to get it, but I'm not sorry I'm not there yet.</td>

Heh, I am still at the point where I just can't imagine bagging it...and I have nothing better. I have a SoulStripper, but I gave that to Shazzog since I get better stat bonuses from the epic...though the SoulStripper probably does better damage.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, what weaps are out there and available to the average player that is better than the Epic for combat?</td>

There was a Ragefire rotation order on Luclin that was so long that I didn't see it as worthwhile to start on a quest, knowing that I couldn't complete the final step until more than 8 months after I was ready for it. Just after people convinced me to work on it and get my pearl, they moved Rage to Skyfire. (I did my time camping in SolB for the turn-in though!)</td>

Once I turned 50 I moved through the epic fairly quickly I think I was up to Ixi/Chardok at 51. Once I killed Ixi, I hit a brick wall.<br />
<br />
My guild is a very small Role playing guild, We were never able to pull off a chardok raid alone. so we had to ask are allies to help. But we were never able to kill the king, In the end it Me(61 cleric) 65 Mage 65 Bard to kill the king, the bard and mage were not kos. after chardok it took me 3 days to get my epic a 3pm to 3pm camp in Sol B then the next day took out rage fire...  Now that I have my epic I am thinking of sacrificing down to 55ish again to make some money selling EE and to group with my guild mates again(I'm the highst level char and too high to group with our GM hehe)</td>

When I got the piece from the King in Chardok our server was still doing a rotation on Ragefire. They hadnt come out with the shards yet. I had just gotten on the rotation when they changed it to having to have shards. Then I took 5 months off from EQ, came back and had my epic done in 2 weeks.</td>

Duhikae is on a leveling freeze until Gadjette catches up. Hopefully another 2 weeks and he will start climbing again. (I'll have her to 30 this weekend, then prolly 40 by next weekend...but until she hits 46 or so, he won't be able to move to higher areas where he can get decent XP)</td>

Dangit, we need a Rasberry emoticon.<br />
<br />
The short version is:<br />
I noticed 2 things- first was that my guild went from one active Shaman (me) to a small platoon of them. Second was that we still had no darn enchanters.<br />
<br />
So Shazzog is off on AFK Island for a while and I am bringing Gadjette Jonz up through the ranks.<br />
Her sisters, Gajjette (SK) and Gajette(Mage), are still down in the low single digits for days when I just actually <i>feel</i> like PLing a lowbie...but Gadjette hit 24 last night and I'm shooting for 27 tonight.</td>

i envy you clerics that have to do the whole shard camp thing. sure, it may take a while, but c'mon. you can do it with a duo, or small group, or whatever. with good faction, you can duo the king nowadays (something i'm planning on doing for a friend in the near future).<br />
<br />
summer, 2001, i was 48 when i started mine, dinged 51 during a naggy kill while waiting for ragefire to pop, and i had planned on retiring the cleric at 49, go fig. we worked on each piece 1 per weekend with another cleric, ragefire was done by list, 2nd on list supposed to help out 1st on list. mine nearly stole my camp twice cuz he didn't like how i was doing it, and after he got camp, he scratched list and ran 5 of his guildies through, essentially ending the list.<br />
<br />
begurgle: 17 hours (other cleric 5)<br />
gimblox: 13 hours (other cleric 3)<br />
plasmatic priest: overkill<br />
ixiblat: 12 groups, 10 clerics got their piece, 2 wipeouts<br />
chardok: 4 attempts, till i REALLY lucked out with QA's help under Lling<br />
ragefire: 166 hours - 2 short of 7 days *twitches* - including helping as 2nd cleric while guildless<br />
<br />
but, all in all, my boyfriend still loves me after that and the bard epic, and i became the lowest on our server to have an epic (at the time) including being the only hate raid cleric and only vox-capable with epic :) gotta have some bragging rights when you can complete it on your own. now i keep losing it in my bags as i have a better weapon for meleeing O_o</td>

The hardest part I'd say was Chardok, only because that required a 3 hour or so commitment from people where the other parts (ix, rage) people only had to put in 30 mins or less.</td>
