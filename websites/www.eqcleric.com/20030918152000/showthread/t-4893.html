<br />
Brewing is a handy skill to raise to 200 as it can be applied to other tradeskills. I'm going to be working more on smithing only because I can carry ore around no problem in the PoK with my drogmor. Otherwise I just don't have the strength to carry it in an indoor zone like Neriak.<br />
<br />
At this point in time, I think I'm going to GM pottery as there seems to be some great high end items with focus effects to put into circulation. There never seems to be enough of these around. And yes, I'll be attempting the prayer shawl quest/dead. I raised my smithing up to 200 on another server so I'm dreading doing it over again with my main character now.</td>

I have accepted the fact that I'm not destined to wear the prayer shawl. <br />
<br />
I have recently been working on trade skills again because the Aid Grimmel quests are very tempting. But I have chosen to get all my skills at or near 200 before I begin the actual "quests".  Rather than focus on a particular skill, I have have dabbling in most of them for an hour or two when I have the free time.  I am enjoying the diversion and having something to do whilst chatting with friends and since I don't have a "goal", I find them relaxing.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Raising your own tradeskills will not make you money unless and until you are a Grandmaster.  Working up your tradeskills is a huge, direct investment of time and platinum.  Even after you are a Grandmaster, Brewing, Baking, Fishing, or Fletching will not make you rich.<br />
<br />
Pottery is a relatively easy and relatively cheap skill to raise, but Grandmaster potters are becoming quite common now.  Jewelcraft is also easy to raise but requires more money.<br />
<br />
If you would like to be a Grandmaster Tailor or Smith, you're embarking on an EQ career which will absorb hundreds of hours.  Personally I'd advise you to start by creating a necromancer on a second account and powerlevelling that character to at least level 50 so they can farm the components for you... honestly, I think that's probably the easiest way.  ;)<br />
<br />
In pp per hour, you're much better off soloing HG's in the Rathe Mountains or Guard in Sebilis than raising your tradeskills.<br />
<br />
However, there is a flip side to this bleak picture.  Many people with surplus pp enjoy raising their tradeskills, and they may well be prepared to purchase tradeskill supplies from you.<br />
<br />
A good way of raising money is to farm leather paddings.  You'll need to be level 20+, and you do it like this:-<br />
<br />
1.  Buy a sewing kit and a skinning knife; the skinning knife is made by smiths.<br />
2.  Go to the Feerrott and head to the standing stones.<br />
3.  Kill all the spiderlings there, which are plentiful and respawn quickly, until you have a couple of stacks of spiderling silks.<br />
4.  Combine two spiderling silks in your sewing kit to make a silk thread.  Repeat this until you have a stack of them.<br />
5.  Get a port to the Stonebrunt Mountains, or if you're a little higher level and a little more confident you can get there through the Warrens.<br />
6.  Kill the leopards and leopardesses.  You want Low Quality pelts; but if you get Medium Quality or High Quality pelts, you can combine them with the skinning knife in your sewing kit to downgrade them to Low Quality.  (Other kinds of pelt are not useful for tradeskills.)  Repeat this until you have a stack of them.<br />
7.  Combine a Low Quality pelt with a Silk Thread to make a Leather Padding.<br />
8.  Sell the Leather Paddings in the Bazaar to the highest bidder.</td>

But with 200+ wis on my cleric, I gain skillups fast enough to go from 0 to 101 in no time on a trade. I got up to around 140 in fletching last week in roughly a half hour.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Tradeskills am teh debil!  But I have to admit they become highly addictive after you start one of them.  I spent an ungodly amount of time skilling up for my 8th shawl not to mention a fortune on components.  I have skills of about 200 in all of them but I dont feel like going any higher atm.  <br />
<br />
Just as Shadow stated, Smithing and tailor will break you if your not sitting on a fat stack of plat already.  On smithing alone I spent about 40k getting all the Ore and junk to get up to about 190 or so.  After that point it becomes all farming and very time consuming.  It would be hard to break even once you do become a GM.<br />
<br />
Tailor is all FARMING.  Everything needs to be farmed.  I nearly went insane with all the time it took to gather all the components just to skill up.  To this day I cringe at the thought of Rockhoppers and their damn hides.  However, if you can put up with it there are some decent things to be made by GMs.<br />
<br />
If you take a look at Fletching, there are some really nice PoP bows that can be made and skilling up with fletching is cheap and no farming needed till I think 200 or so.  Also the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12481" target="_blank">Blessed Champion Arrows</a>  are a nice cultural piece that many like to have due to their extreme damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Pottery is a nice skill to attempt as well but as Shadow said many GM exist now do to the simplicity of becoming one, thats not to say it is easy just more so than others.

heres my question:<br />
I have very little funds to spend on tradeskilling (<i>maybe</i> 100-200) and i was wondering what skill is the easiest to raise and will provide the most fun and possibly profit in my down time?<br />
<br />
And what dose a GM in Fishing do? Is it worth the time to just get my gnome to fix me some animated bait and a collapsable fishing pole to raise it while sitting at the SH Pool?<br />
<br />
thats about it, should probably get back to my summer school class. Now i see how you guys at work all day feel. this is death!!/dead</td>

I have not started to tradeskill yet with Elli but Raevynn, my Shammy, does all of them but the jewelcraft. She is at about 100-150 for each of them. The easiest and cheapest to raise is the brewing. This is how I raised mine (to 157 still not onto the Mino Brew's yet tried some but failed lots so went to the Shar Vahl essence instead) for less than 20pp /smilewink<br />
<br />
Fetid Essence -- 1-121 -- combine a FLASK of water (vendor stuff not foraged) and a fishing grub (Caden Zarik in PoK)  resells for 1-2sp to vendor <br />
<br />
Shar Vahl essence -- 122-187 -- combine flask of water and a payala fruit (ground spawn in Shadeweavers thicket under the blue leafed trees 28 total in zone you go in circles until you have about 2 backpacks full) resells for about 2gp to vendor  <br />
<br />
Minotaur Hero's Brew -- 188-248 -- combine 3 malt, 1 yeast, 2 flask water, 2 short beer, 1 cask (success yields 1 brew and 2 empty bottles, failure yields 1 cask and 2 empty bottles) have not resold anyof htese yet so not sure on resale value atm<br />
<br />
Oh yea word to the wise with the trade skilling if you try to do something too far ahead of where you are your skills will come few and far between eating a ton of your hard earned components along hte way but if you shoot for small jumps they seem to come faster ;)</td>

When i did it, i think i got to 142 and it cost less than 50pp to do  and took maybe an hour and a half.. and at that skill lv, you are starting to be able to produce Stat Enhancing Foods.<br />

suggestion, if you are going to do pottery, go farm gorge for heavy clay!<br />
past 199 this is the cheapest thing i have found to make, with the least amount of time spent farming.<br />

it is not for the faint of heart however, you have to go fishing in Sebelis =) for the firing anyway, you can do the skill ups and never fire them.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Due to connection problems yesterday, I couldn't stay connected so I didn't want to get into an experience group just to go LD, I decided to sit down and start Tradeskilling... and I want to give a big round of applause to those people that can actually sit and tradeskill all day! /cheer<br />
<br />
When I started, all my tradeskills were zero... after 8 hours of tradeskilling (not counting LD's)... Baking is 152, Brewing is 128, Fletching is 21, Smithing is 22, and Pottery is 21.<br />
<br />
I just have one question... how much should I expect Smithing to cost me to get over 200?  Just with the little bit I have researched it, it seems very expensive.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">if you goto ToFS or CC and collect your own velium, smithing don't cost as much. but it is still expensive buying the ore for the lower lvl smithing. and the patterns and molds do get expensive as well. the good thing is they at least sell back to the vendors for almost 75% return i think, matbe a little less. another way to cut the cost is to make your own leather padding.</td>
