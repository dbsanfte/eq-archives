<br />
For all of you who play on the Tribunal, hi, I recently left my old guild, the one that got me my epic and I leveled up in, from about 52 to 60.  I decided to leave at 60, actually when I dinged 60 because the guild was at the same point it had been at when I joined, 3 months earlier (Gestalt btw), Kael raids to palace and attempting HoT.  I was offered to join another guild (Eradication) and I decided to do so because the leader had been my friend for a while and he is an amazing EQ strategist.  Anyway enough of a back story, now to my actual question.  When I left I was surprised to be told that I was holding the guild back because I "do not know how to heal."  In PoV (mobs can quad 500 or around there).  It was claimed that the MT died 4 times in an hour, I think it was less, but same number-frame nontheless.  Now does that make a bad cleric?  On a raid if the enchanter dies once it suddenly makes you a bad cleric?  It seems we have the responsibility of the world on us, and anybody's death becomes your fault.  Now from a DPS class standpoint it makes it easy to blame the cleric, but from an enchanter's? where their success is only measured in mezing which may kill the tank, if not done properly, and then directly goes into the cleric not saving the tank.  I'm not exactly sure what reply I'll get from this thread, but give me ideas, it might even turn into an interesting discussion.<br />
<br />
On a side note,  Any easy ways to get the spell BoA with a guild that is a couple weeks from doing Vindi?<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, first off I would say, your tanks die no less than an average tank at  any high-end raid. Same follows for enchanters, druids, and yes, even clerics.<br />
<br />
That being said, what makes a "Bad Cleric"? Speaking from a raiding stand point, a bad cleric is one who is afk ALOT. Especially un-announced. <br />
<br />
A cleric  that doesn't maintain spot-healing, is a bad cleric. By that I mean, constantly, and fluidly assist healing. <br />
<br />
Clerics that don't help ress during wipe-outs (Speaking of epic-weilders only here..having it bagged is NO excuse ;( ), but instead sit on their ass and med or go afk after they get their ress. These are bad clerics.<br />
<br />
Clerics who ONLY heal their party members on a raid, and no one else...are bad clerics.<br />
<br />
Clerics who don't buff because "someone else at the raid always does it" aren't necessarily bad clerics, they just suck /rolleyes <br />
<br />
Raid healing is alot different than group healing. And while it can seem like you are responsible for the MT's health, the chanters health, and everyones health, to lay the blame solely on YOU, is wrong of your former guild. <br />
<br />
Every class has responsibilities/expectations at a raid level, but each of those classes also has to be willing to go above their "call of duty" for success. <br />
<br />
Yes, we are EQ's whipping post for raid failure, no matter what. The key  is just to do all you can, when you can, and blow that type of thing off. Granted, there ARE times when yes...it IS the clerics fault:( , but to say 1 cleric's healing methods held an entire guild back is ludicris by any standard.<br />
<br />
As for an easy place to get BoA, try punking some Western Wastes Dragons. They are easy kills, and generally drop spells. Or research it, as most the components can be gotten with one to two groups.</td>

Could you clarify that as to heal whatever the mob is hitting? as in spot healing? or when asked?<br />
<br />
And about BoA, its not listed on Alla's about WW's dropping them, only the regular aego, perhaps over the ridge? dangerous but get some good drops.  Research components is some kind of luck, BoA stuff makes KEI, and doesn't stay long in the bazaar if it makes it.<br />

<br />
Aye. And, conversly, a cleric who does "spot" heal, is a good cleric. To be honest, I think I enjoy NOT having the MT in my group on raids because it frees me up to do more spot healing--I love cycling through the various casters or quickly tapping out /tar name and dropping a heal off on someone. Just makes the game more enjoyable for me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Dyschord is right on target with everything she remarked about making a good/bad cleric. But I suppose I'll add some more items to her list.<br />
<br />
A bad Cleric is one who cannot keep a simple ch rotation going. Obviously, sometimes Lag is going to cause a person to miss his/her spot. Or possibly a stun or another form of spell disruption, but as a whole, the ch rotation is the easiest--most mindless--aspect of our job. And yet, people still screw it up.<br />
<br />
A bad cleric doesn't camp when he/she is told to. It's not so much of an issue in PoP, as wipeouts there certainly aren't so bad. But, for God's sake, if the guild is doing Hate, Fear, or any "old world" zone without a graveyard at least one cleric has to camp /q out when the raid leader calls it.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Apparently we posted at roughly the same time, but let me expound on what I view "spot healing" to be by giving you a very simple example of what happened in a raid this evening.<br />
<br />
We were raiding PoI to take down the Dragon. For those of you who have never done it, essentially you lead a gnome through the PoI zone, kill all the mobs, and eventually fight a big old mechanical dragon. Obviously, all the while the gnome has to live. Anyway, so the guild is steamrolling thorugh PoI and a caster yells out in /rsay that he has aggro. The caster wasn't in my group, but as a cleric I immediately targeted him by doing a /tar name and dropped a heal on him very quickly. That's how I view spot healing.</td>

At any moment that I'm not casting a heal, I'm hitting my assist hotkey.  That will put on target whomever has agro at that moment.  I'm ready with a fast heal when necessary - especially at the beginning of a fight, before the MT has gotten solid agro, a shaman might draw attention for a slow; or what's even more dangerous... a resisted slow.  /tar player is great to use when you see someone who shouldn't get summoned by a mob.  <br />
<br />
And no, there is no possible way one cleric could hold back an entire guild.  Sounds like a touch of sour grapes to me - perhaps someone angry at you for leaving and saying dumb things.</td>

I agree can not really add much more to what has been stated above on spot heals or Com Heal chains. The only thing is that when you get into Com Heal chains You have to realize that No matter what number 1 priority is the MA.

We've traditionally awarded it to druids, shaman and paladins, since they are not busy with healing to the extent that clerics are in the encounters in which the spell is critical.  <br />

1. I have serious questions about your old guild's leadership.  If they honestly felt your play style was holding the guild back they needed to pull you aside and address it.  They are responsible for coaching you and helping you be a better player for the improvement of their guild as a whole.  Leadership quite often isn't easy or fun but if the leadership fails to do it's often unpleasant job then the guild will suffer.  Giving and receiving constructive criticism with grace and dignity is an invaluable life skill in RL and EQ.<br />
<br />
2. I also question your motives for leaving this guild and wonder if you didn't use them to gain the qualifications to enter an "uber" guild?  It seems to me that they made an investment in you by getting you your epic and helping you through a difficult strech of levels, only to have you /guildremove on the day you hit lvl 60.  Why weren't you in your friend's guild at level 52, why wait until level 60?  Sounds to me like it was because you couldn't get in without being level 60.  Also, your stated reason for leaving is because the guild didn't progress in the 90 days you were in it.  It sounds to me like the guild's leadership was trying to make progress by investing in it's players, by doing important steps like getting their cleric his epic to make more difficult raids that much easier.  Can you see how they might feel betrayed?  <br />
<br />
I think their "bad cleric" comment is in fact "sour grapes" but I also think they could have been more critical of your character so you probably got off easy.  I hope you are more honest with your new guild than you were with your last one.<br />
<br />
Again, these are just my opinions based on the facts posted here.  If I'm dead wrong so be it, as I said I have nothing to gain or lose either way.  If I've offended anyone, that was not my intention, and I apologize.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Yea, I was thinking about Regular Aego when I posted locations..was late, after raids :(  My apologies on that one!<br />
<br />
As for the questions on "spot healing"...<br />
<br />
Those who suggested a blank /assist key are right on the money. It is one of the single-most valuable macros we can have. I personally have my finger on that macro constantly, as it will assist off the mob, then again assist off the person that was last aggro.<br />
<br />
I also keep a bank of macros that /target <MT name here>. I have the same for our raids "most summoned" casters, and bards. Even a couple for the SK/Paladins, who end up on off-tank duties. If we have too many mobs in camp, and targetting visually is tight (small confined spaces), I cycle through those that I know are off-tanking, to keep tabs on their health.<br />
<br />
For CH chains, I generally make this one simple suggestion to my clerics: Make an /assist <lead-off cleric's name> key. This helps for fast tank switches, and unless your lead-off cleric is dead, or LD, they should be the one you take your queue from. Also make a secondary /assist <cleric ahead of you> key, in case your lead dies, LD, lags. <br />
<br />
For leading a CH chain, keep that /assist key up! If you have a problem with video lag on raids, make a "mob assist " key (/assist <mobs name here>, so you can pick up the next tank fast. If a MT "chain" is preset, then having pre-made /tar <mt name> keys work great here.<br />
<br />
Another important thing, in a ch chain, is...if you Fizzle, or the tank ends up /oor for your ch...SPOT YOURSELF! I cannot stress how important this is, and I see many clerics who do not do it! CH fizzels? count to 5, then cast Sup Remedy, or Sup light (depending on your chain speed). It's things like that , that can make or break any fight.</td>

I just blow this off (knowing shes an high elf they can be a bit .... well you know ),So she tells the MT i heall you and when you get to 40% ill CH, 40 % ? im' thinking wow thts a 10 sec cast the tank could be dead by then,i usally chain supers to keep them up to full. so heres a question,not having much raid experince with high level mobs , Is that common practice wha she is doing? and do i need to get in the practice of casting CH durring combat?<br />
 Now ill finish the story,i tell her Is ok hun im going to be logging in about 10 anyway so there going to need you." So my pet SK pulls like 6 drovlags and all helll breaks loose,now i satrt my thing chain healing the Sk while shes telling me who im going to be healing and who she will be healling and on and on,so in the process i pull aggro from mmy healing ,the cahnter is getiing mobed and the wiz is running for his life,which leaves 2 on the SK still, so i instill the ones one me look around and the high elf is sitting down a few feet away, i go back to healing ,the mobs break i instill look around ,shes still sitting,only now shes moved away from the battle farther,the SK finhes the mob that was on the chanter and turmds to the 2 on him when mine breakfor the third time, at this point i have to run to the KC zoneline as im down to like 7% mana. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Wow DL, its been awhile.  To answer your first question Urry, Cheals are us Clerics bread and butter and our desert is this sweat spell called Supernal light (IMO).  From what I can remember I rarely if ever used Cheal in DL unless I got a Tank that should have been in KC in my group.  Now the term tank doesnt truely mean anything till u step foot in the planes because if i remember correctly in DL the "tank" was the person getting hit atm.  Sure its been awhile since I was in DL pounding away, maybe peoples alts are all tweeked out and able to actualy hold aggro now.<br />
<br />
To answer your question about Chealing, yes you will have to get in the habit of chealing ALL THE TIME.  Once tanks have about 6-9k hps the only way to truely heal them is to drop that 7.5k bomb on them.  Right now your wondering how the hell do I land a 10 second heal on someone?  Basically timing, knowledge of the mob, and knowing your tank.  If you wanna be a chealer and dazzle your fella expers in DL, start that cheal as soon as the tank engages.  That way once the 10 seconds is up he should be pretty beat up and be real happy hes about to get completely healed.  If say he dies before the heal lands...its back to Superior heals for you because hes lacking in the red bar area.  After that first cheal lands see how much life he has left because once hes taking that much damage that is when you can start the cheal and still save him from death...in theory.  <br />
<br />
As far as what she was doing...I dont have the slightest.  Im sure her intentions were good and your just adding a lil drama to the story, which is coo I like drama.  I can probably guess why everytime you looked at her she was sitting, medding is the simple answer and I can only assume since no one died in your story that she was healing then sitting and you never saw it.<br />
<br />
Back to the main topic, what makes for a good cleric.  I have to agree with everything mentioned above and have but one thing to add...Good Clerics single box.  Sure there are decent clerics that duel box but they will never be Good clerics in my eyes.  Being a cleric requires quick reflexes in some situations and being preoccupied by your War and Shammy on the other computers can cause you just 1 second delay in that cheal which can mean death or miss that the Chanter is under attack and land that SR in time. Just my opinion I could be wrong.<br />

I have to agree, with 1 small exception...<br />
<br />
I've 2 and 3 boxed clerics on raids (While playing my cleric, as well), and so has my guild-leader. Playing 2 or 3 clerics at the same time, is pretty fun, and actually very easy. (*Note: I have 3 machines, so i'm not using window mode to 2 or 3 box, when I do) 2-3 boxing clerics, when it's all clerics, has probably helped more of our raids than hurt. That's half our spothealing force, on most boss encounters, in fact. Hell, back in VT, that would be half our CH chain!/rolleyes <br />
<br />
I have seen people 2-box cleric on raids (It happens..clerics go inactive and you need the heals), but they do have to focus more on one toon (usually the healer). While I used to hate seeing people bot a cleric, I've gotten used to it, as EQ gets older and real clerics fade away:(</td>

i also do not like it cause i have a bit of a laggy comp when i am playing EQ and i often lag in Planes... lately this is not as bad but when it happens ppl almost, or do, die.<br />

Well, I'm a bit relaxed on calling heals.<br />
<br />
There was a time I used to spam that crap all over, but, it began to drive even myself crazy. I got relaxed on it, in group situations, simply due to the fact I mainly duo with my boyfriend, or 2-box my chanter for exp. <br />
<br />
In a raid situation though, I'm pretty silent. It's just my nature when I play. I will call an "important heal" (Tank switches, I call it right off, in /gu and raid (yep, seperate macro for that...can you tell I have much love for hotkeys?!) so spotters know the chain has switched, for example) I DO ask that our app/recruit clerics call their heals in raidsay, because I like to see how fast they are with spotting, /assisting, etc. As for our fulltime members, I just watch their casting animations to see if they are afk or not ;( /rolleyes. <br />
<br />
It's really a personal/guildleader call, on calling heals, raidwise. When you have 10 clerics at a raid, all that spam can be a pain. Groupwise, it's a personal call. Most tanks are cool with no called heals, some get antsy and need their hands held:p</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'd just like to point out that in some of the PoP zones where the mobs hit MUCH harder than the ones in Velks (for example), you may have to start CHing at 50% or more. Sometimes it can be hard to judge when to CH bc you can get in a pattern where a mob only takes x amount of hp in x amount of time and then suddenly the mob will start taking more. PoI is extremely laggy for me.<br />
<br />
I got accused of being a bad cleric bc this happened. I was lagging and I had told the group that I lagged and I asked one of the other people in group-- a beastlord-- if he would spot heal if I said "bh" (for backup heal) when I lagged or fizzled and saw that CH wasn't going to hit. I haven't yet gotten Divine Light. I'm stuck with Remedy as my fastest heal but sometimes it isn't enough to save a tank that needs a CH. And my recast time sucks. I've lost tanks bc I fizzled and recast timer didn't go in time for me to cast any other spells. Anyways, the bh thing was working for awhile. The beastlord apparently asked his guild why a cleric would need backup healer and that I should time my CHs better, but he did not say this to me. So I didn't think it bothered him. I've helped other clerics out with quickie heals when I wasn't sure their CHs would hit. It sucked bc my CHs would have hit if I hadn't been delayed by lag. So someone in group went and pulled two mobs and the tank got smacked. Chanter mezzed one of them. I started lagging. I was trying to CH and realized that bc of lag it wasn't going to hit. I asked for backup heal. Nothing happened. Ch hit like a milisecond after the tank went down. I immediately retargeted the bard and began CH bc he was getting hit hard. Again I asked for backup heal bc even the fastest I could press buttons on my computer wasn't fast enough. Again, CH hit just a milisecond too late. The beastlord complained that he couldn't heal while fighting and that I should time my heals better. The bard told me that I should've used another quickie heal before CH. Not realizing that with my connection, casting a quickie heal wouldn't have bought enough time and the recast time for Remedy wouldn't have allowed a save either. I can't remember if one of the mobs died, but I know that the second mob was unmezzed and the beastlord and pet were fighting it. All of a sudden the beastlord said "**** it!" and zoned out-- leaving the enchanter to get the aggro. I was trying to heal her when she managed to zone out. Then I had to zone out. It took me about 5 minutes to zone bc my connection sucks so bad (I get 19.2kbps bc my phonelines are horrible). When I finally zoned the group had mostly disbanded. I medded a little and the tank and I headed back in so I could rez. At this point the tank and I were the only ones in group. I asked if he knew what happened to the bard, he said "no" and told me not to worry about what the people said to me, that they were just mad. So we zoned back (which took another 5 min for me to zone in) in and I rezzed the tank and healed him. Then sat to med and was preparing to send a message to the bard asking if he needed me to rez him or if he wanted me to find him someone with a better rez-- unfortunately before I could type anything someone pulled a HUGE train. I had to zone out. 5 minutes later I finished zoning and got a nasty tell from the beastlord calling me a bad cleric and saying that he was putting me on ignore and blacklisting me to his guild bc I wouldn't even rez my dead groupies. I saw someone mention something /ooc (unrelated to the situation) and /ooc a question only to have the bard start flaming me /ooc calling me retarded and saying that I let him die and refused to rez him. I sent him a tell asking him where he got the idea that I'd refused to rez him. I had been trying to go rez him when there was a train. He ignored me. I /ooc that I was already on my way in to rez him and that I had not refused. Of course this might have looked like I was only going to rez bc I was pressured into it.. So it made me look bad. 5 minutes later I zoned in and asked the bard if he still needed a rez. He said "no". that he'd gotten one. I apologized and said that I had been ready to rez him but there was a train.  I was going to explain why it took so long due to my slow zoning but I went LD. It took me 5 to 10 to get back in and everytime I tried to say something to him I went LD. So I was stuck in chain LD for about 45 min.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should have done something differently but what was done was done. And I'm open to any suggestions. I mean, I was relatively new to the zone and was trying to learn how it worked and stuff. It's not like I was a veteran who had spent a lot of time there. I'm also going to be much more careful about my timing on heals. I guess the beastlord hadn't been present when I told the group that I had a really crap connection. I have since changed my preference settings so that my zones are saved and after the first time zoning in, they should take less time to zone in again.<br />
<br />
Oh, and another thing to list as a "bad cleric"-- <br />
1) a cleric who refuses to heal. <br />
2) I've been told a cleric who is /oom constantly bc they nuke or mele when they should be healing or medding. (an exception is when they are told to do so and keep just enough mana to do backup healers if they are not main healer).<br />
3) a cleric who will flee when they are not in danger and have not been told to "run" or do not have permission from the group to leave (if they do not say they are leaving or if they say they are leaving and are told to wait). <br />
4) does not give a damn about other players and is only out for his/herself. <br />
5) does not learn from their mistakes and repeatedly makes the same ones all the time. Especially if they have been told about what they are doing wrong.<br />
<br />
In response to what someone said about "spot healing"-- if you're in the lower 50s level range so you have less mana and happen to lag, spot healing isn't always as easy as it sounds. when I am on a raid, if my tanks in group are getting hit hard and fast and I need to keep them targetted constantly, I don't really have time to check on other group's tanks. Especially if nobody announces that another group's tank needs a heal. Also, I don't want to waste mana by healing someone that another cleric is already CHing. There are some exceptions. If my tanks are not in trouble I can target the MT and do a Remedy or Celestial Heal. I always ask people to tell me if a person in their group needs a heal from me. For the assist, this may not always work bc sometimes the mobs can change targets very quickly. I have assisted a mob before and right afterwards they switched to a new target and slammed them. It all depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
For the buffing, someone who does not buff is not a bad cleric if they are told that someone else is buffing and they are to save mana. It is someone who is unwilling to buff that is a bad cleric. If you have a higher level cleric with better buffs on the raid, you might want to defer to them for buffs as it will help your people more and their buffs will overwrite your own.<br />
<br />
I like to think I'm a good cleric. Well, I'm not a bad one IMO. I try to be a good cleric. I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. And when I realize I've made mistakes I feel really bad and apologize profusely. If I make a mistake and don't realize it I need someone to point it out so I can learn. I've learned alot through mistakes and it has made me better at what I do.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I have to admit, I have upset people before by not zoning when I was told to bc I wanted to stay to heal the tank. I don't like to leave people without help and I've had tanks get mad bc they stopped to wait for me to zone and I was waiting for them to zone. I'm the kind of person who holds doors open for everyone... I don't like to have the door held open for me. Now, I don't always wait. If I realize the tank is going to zone soon and that they will make it to zone I will go. I've stood at the zone healing the tank saying "I'll zone in a sec, just go now" (err, that was what I said). I've saved some of them that way. So a cleric who doesn't zone when told to isn't always a bad cleric. I'm usually pretty good at judging when I have time to heal and when I should just run the hell away.<br />
<br />
Like one time in velks (one time at band camp?) our main tank accidentally pulled the castle. I saw him go down faster than I could even start a heal and my group started going. I knew that there was no way I could get a heal off in time to save anyone so I ran my encumbered high elf ass to the zone. I felt bad about it and apologized but my group said that it was ok bc I would've just died too. And I was there to rez them-- and the other people who died from the train. Since my group had pulled the train I announced rezzes for free. Ok, I almost always rez for free. I've never asked for a donation, I just accept them if offered.<br />
I'll try to hush now. :-)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I am confused at some posts here in experiences that they have had. I know that a cleric is the prime healer, when did he become the ONLY healer. Where is anyones job in a group etched in stone. Anyone who has healing abilities whould also have a corner of their eye on hp screen. How many times does a tank in tier 2 in PoP get down to near 40% with a CH cast on him and all of a sudden a mob that is slowed starts whacking for 500+ triples.  A clerics ch timing is from experience from zone and tank in group but shit always happens so others should be ready to assist for the good of the group when it does. The same goes for a chanter when a bad pull occurs and 4 screaming razorfiends are approaching is it the chanters job alone to mez all. I think not. If so usually all will be dead when cleric agroes and dies trying to keep chanter alive. The life of the group is the responsibility of all in the group. Why are the casters with root nuking the one mob on the tank as the other mobs are after the cleric and chanter. All in group are also responsible for some part in crowd control. Yes chanter is main controler but others classes also  need to do their part. Too many times i have drawn agro in a healing frenzy  and never have gotten assist from druid with a heal because he thinks that i am the healer. It is not a hard game but eq has created classes with mutiple taskings so use them. I also have a root spell up as a cleric to help save self in an agro situation or to root one incoming to assist chanter as 4 come pouring in. Also i have found it beneficial to cast celestial elixir  in tier 2 pop on tank as mob attacks right at start when there are 2  and target chanter immediately in case of failed mezz.This has been done a lot and agro never seems to occur. Same can be done to shammy who tried to root mob. This give me more time that tank doesnt need a heal. Final note uber players in a bad group will still be a bad group.<br />

A bad cleric is one who fails to keep one or more members of his or her group/raid alive when they might reasonably be expected to have succeeded.<br />
<br />
Cleric is not a forgiving class.  When you make a mistake, everyone sees the consequences very clearly; so people who are "bad" clerics rapidly get a reputation for being "bad" clerics.<br />
<br />
Someone who has a reputation for being a "bad" cleric will lose the confidence of their group or guild, and will find that when they are looking for a new group or a new guild, only the more desperate groups or guilds will take them on.<br />
<br />
Once this has happened, the "bad" cleric only gets into desperate groups or guilds, and the desperate people will throw the cleric's "badness" into sharp relief.<br />

Most people understand that dying happens while exping especially in the planes.  Rez them and appologize if you like but do not make excuses like oh lag spike or I fizzled.  This can create a aura of doubt around you.  Instead say hey that was my bad it wont happen again.  Even on my best days were Im consistently landing my cheals at 10% I mess up or something weird happens.  Just kill the mob keep whoever u can alive and rez the fallen right away then buff them as soon as they zone.  Most EXP groups just want EXP and getting them back into action asap is better than any excuse you can lay down.  <br />

OMG /agree totally Dyscord.  Heal spamming whatever channel it is in getz very annoying.  I tend to not call my casual heals such when clearing to Boss_Mob_01.  The patch healers tend to drive me up a wall with their spamming of Inc Patch heal to %t.  Their heals are so small that they have to cast it 4 times to make any kind of difference ending up with 4 seperate heal messages.

To conwyn, seems you got served the shaft end of the stick.  Somethings arent always ment to be.  For instance Im not tall so I wasnt intended to be a basketball player.  Good internet connection is not so much a bonus but a priorty for good clerics.  Does this mean your a bad cleric...HELL NO.  It just means you have to make some lemonade out of those bad boys.  It does mean however that you're not gonna advance to the top rung because high end guilds require Clerics to have solid connections and good comps.  As far as your story goes, you did your best but unfortuantely on that day it wasnt enough and some people are just assholes.  Thats just how it goes, pick up the pieces and try again.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is healing is a rough task and we arent truely outfitted for it till post 60.  Like Conwyn said, If he missed timed his Cheal and had to revert to his patches, it wasnt even enough to counter the hits.  This can land a young cleric oom fast.  Things change once you get my all time favorite heal Supernal Remedy.  This was designed like an eraser on a pencil.  Mistimed the cheal?  NP.  Just duck with at least 2 seconds left and the tank is 1400 hps happier.  Repeat till you have enough cushion to cheal.  Great spell but until we get it we are ill equiped IMO.  This can often be misleading to other classes that think we are bad clerics when in reality we are doing our best with what we have to work with.<br />
<br />
So hang in their young Clerix and you will get the tools needed for our trade including Supernal Light which I still dont really see a use for other than dedicated patch duty...anyone?  Guess that one could be another post all together.<br />

p.s. Supernal Remedy is bought off of Vicar Cearan the one that you turn parches into.  I made the mistake of thinking it was a parch spell and went the better half of my level with out it.  Just a lil FYI.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hi. My name is Galvatist Goodhealer, and I announce my heals.<br />
<br />
No one in my guild/group has ever told me not to announce the heals. In fact, when I stop announcing them for a period of time I got some tells to heal and so on and so forth. That was a handful of levels ago, however, so I guess old habits are hard to break.<br />
<br />
As for the lagging issues--<br />
<br />
Just want to make sure you have all the opstions (models, spelleffects, corpses, names, clipping, etc. turned off). Also, if I have lots and lots of lag (PoI hates me too), then I stare at the ground, wall, or something else. Personally it's no big deal to me since I was one of those clerics that spent 35 levels staring at a book while I was medding. In fact, it's because of the lag I get that I usually do a /tar instead of an /assist. Targeting the mob many times is impossible because of lag I get, so just punching out a handful of letters (I never type the full name) works more quickly for me. Perhaps I am doing something wrong when I am assisting, and if that's the case, let me know.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I always call me heals. I expect others to as well. On clearings CH is a spell that simply isn't used. In some cases you're setting yourself up for failure on raids. Flurry drakes back in old NToV, Elite Diaku guards...there are some mobs you just don't wait 10 seconds on. Everyone just tosses lights and remedies and chloros and infusions. I want to know when ppl are doing this so I don't go overboard wasting mana, and don't simply watch the tank drop.<br />

Supernal Remedy is not a *necessary* spell until you get it. To say that clerics below 61 are ill-equipped is a lame statement at best considering that the level cap was 60 (or less) for over 3/4 of EQ's existence. Divine Light sucks, especially sucks your mana, but to say you are ill-equipped just isn't fair.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to agree with what someone said earlier. The bottom line is a cleric must pay attention. It's often a boring job, often a job that makes you go cross-eyed, but be aware of everything and react to it and you will do fine 90% of the time. The other 10% is experience in knowing how some reactions aren't the brightest idea. (Here comes the pull...Supernal Light on the tank!)</td>

Very good question! I was thinking that myself. And I should've said something to the people who critisized me for those deaths in PoI. When I mentioned this scenario to someone else they said "Why was the beastlord in melee when they have a pet to do that for them?"<br />
<br />
I turned all models, 3dsky, particle effects, bard songs, others hits, others misses, etc all off. I have the graphics set to lowest settings (a shame since i have a GeForce Ti 4600-- and 1Gb of RAM so it tells me I should be able to have all of them on). I don't have trouble in most zones. But zones with alot of people and really heavy graphics tend to lag me. I dont' know what it is about PoI but sometimes I just get bad lag spikes. I usually tell people in my group when I am lagging or when I think I am going LD. If I say LD it means my meter is red, I'm unable to move, and I think I'm about to get totally disconnected.<br />
<br />
Paying attention is very important. If I know I'm not feeling well enough to pay attention I tell people that I'm not feeling well. I generally won't even go group, I'll work on tradeskills when I feel scatterbrained. And I get annoyed when people in rl distract me. Like when someone is calling my name and asking me to do something for them every two seconds. Gah. Especially when it's stuff they can do themselves.. (little venting there. heh).<br />
<br />
I think what he/she meant about clerics being ill-equipped pre lvl 60 was more along the lines that clerics aren't as effective as they are post 60. They aren't necessarily bad, but a post 60 cleric can do more. Of course it all depends on what gear you have. I have some gear that saves some mana when I cast spells below a certain level. And some that saves components. And those buffs that lower casting time.. A pre-60 cleric with focus items and mana preservation items can be more effective.<br />
<br />
I generally don't announce when I'm doing Remedy bc I don't have a hokey for it. I hold down ALT and 1 to cast it. CH and celestial heal I have hotkeyed to announce. My sister taught me to use my mouse as little as possible. I type /tar to get people-- sucks if they are out of range though. I sometimes use /loot if my mouse is acting up. I use the function keys to target people in my group. and if there is only one mob I can use F8 to target to cast Mark of Retribution or to nuke. I have my CH and CelH macrod so it announces in /g and /sa. I fix it to say it on raids so that other clerics do not waste mana to cast those spells.<br />
<br />
Here's another thing I just thought about : Sometimes it is more mana efficient to nuke a mob and get it closer to death so it can't continue to keep hurting the tank. I've found that the mana it cost to nuke a mob to death is sometimes less than the mana it would take to keep healing the tank for the duration of the fight. I've had people tell me in group "why are you nuking instead of healing?" and I tell them that healing is taking more mana and nuking is taking less and causing less injury to the tank. I remember one time (in Velks) when I ran oom, had no mind buffs, and the tank was going down. I knew that I wouldn't be able to get enough mana up in time to heal the tank again. I asked the wizzie to evac. He ignored me. I got up and started bashing the mob with my shield so it stunned it and it couldn't hit the tank as much. I told the tank to back away for a sec and he let me beat on the mob for awhile. Finally convinced the wizzie to evac us (we had gotten hit by a train bc an angry ranger/warrior had started shooting arrows at mobs our enchanter had mezzed-- chanter had already died bc of it). We managed to kill off the mob I was beating on. I think it probably would've killed the tank if I hadn't intervened. (I can bash harder than I hit with my centi warhammer). I also get up and mele when I am full mana. If I see tank getting low I just use function to target and heal, and then assist to go back to the mob. :-)<br />
<br />
Ugh. I hate when the mob suddenly starts doing more damage to the tank than usual and I know CH won't hit. Especially bc for some reason my recast time is so bad. Well, that's mostly when I'm in the planes. Unless someone has a huge train on them in Velks, I can usually heal fast enough. Velks is sooo much more relaxed than the planes now. I mean, I used to think Velks was hectic.. Although trains are nasty there. I was lucky to have Hodr (a wizzy) last time I was there. Someone pulled a train, I thought I was gonna die bc I caught aggro from healing. Next thing I know I'm zoning bc he evacced us to the zone-in. Having good people in group really helps. <br />
<br />
Oh, runspeed 3 is a HUGE help. I caught aggro in velks bc invis wore when I was surrounded by spideys. I was able to outrun the little buggers. It's especially nice in zones where you can't have sow cast. (anyone else think it's unfair for npcs to be able to sow themselves indoors while players can't?). I recommend putting AA points into runspeed before anything else. Now I'm trying to figure out what to put my next point in.<br />

<br />
The post was aimed at XP groups in the planes, Conwyns to be exact.  No you're right, we have made it this far with out SR but when in the old days have we XP grinded with mobs that trip for 400-600?  Its damn near impossible to catch up on a missed Cheal with ER taking 3 seconds and only healing less then 1k Hps.  SR is a heal made with the Planes in mind.<br />
<br />
So I guess I should restate my opinion to Clerics under 60 are ill-equiped for groups in the <i>Planes</i>.<br />
<br />
Conwyn I felt your lag pains when PoP first came out.  The screen lag/latency in the Planes is just sick.  First time I stepped foot in PoK I thought I made a wrong turn into the Bazaar.  SoE pushes more crap products into our laps before finishing them (read PoTime) with each expansion.  Now Im no computer wiz but Ive been told that PoP has some major memory leak problems and the longer you stay online the more noticeable the lag.  Ram is a great way to reduce lag and load times if you have a decent connection.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Speaking of lag only, in the past I used to build maps for the game Half-Life. There was a certain "rule" that you could make the maps as detailed as you'd like, so long as when the map was full of players the frame rate was acceptable to everyone. If certain areas of the map had a high poly count resulting in low frame rates, that area would have to be optimized otherwise the map would be totally unacceptable by players no matter how cool the level was. In some instances the visibility to a zone is cut down by placing a wall or turn in a hallway so when a player is in one of the areas, the engine won't be forced to draw more on screen than the recommended computer can handle. This rule appears to be totally ignored by the level development staff at Sony making zones as pretty as possible, then having one or two people run around to test them out to see how they look. So the zones end up being pushed to the limit to run smooth when only a low number of players are in the zone. They either don't test zones with twenty plus players or they simply just don't care.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any planes other than the PoK but I must say that zone seriously lags for the little they're trying to show (or should I say <i>too much</i> to show). There simply is too many polygons being drawn to what most computers can handle. The bazaar is another story. Sure it runs smooth as silk when nobody is in the zone, but look at it when it's populated: with your clip plane up you can view from one end to the other almost (minus the arena, wtf is with that anyway?). There should have been more dividing walls to break the zone up more. It would have been smarter to get rid of the arena and put some of the stalls in that area. Do you notice when you enter the arena the lag goes away? The visibility blocking is quite effective here.<br />
<br />
I have a decent computer and there is no reason I should lag heavily in places like the PoK. There is simply too many polygons so when combined with the player models it brings the frame rate to a crawl. Sony has basically thrown any sort of standard out the window and just build these zones to look pretty.<br />
<br />
Now mind you these rules are for a twitch game where frame rate is everything, but I still think these rules should apply to EQ as well. I don't enjoy grinding through a zone.<br />
<br />
Sorry to get off topic, this issue just bothers me constantly as it does no good to people who depend on having a constant frame rate.</td>

I know too well about lag. Up until a week ago I was running a 450 mhz with 8 mb integrated video. When Luclin first came out, not only was it awfully laggy, but suddenly all of Velious and much of Kunark was as well. I never had any lag dealing with the server fortunately, but I have had such bad video lag that when playing my bard, running with selo's, I could not run away from a snared mob.<br />
<br />
I would disagree with nuking; that is almost never a good idea as a substitute for healing. In most cases your group can outdamage your Reckoning (or whatever nuke) in the time you cast it, plus you're using mana and taking up precious seconds not healing the tank.</td>

Err, I should rephrase and be more specific.. I meant in a situation where the tank is not about to drop dead. One where the tank is not hurt too badly and it just drains more mana to keep healing when it would take less mana to just kill the mob.  It all depends on the mob and the situation. Sometimes I know I will run out of mana if I just keep healing and the mob doesn't get hurt worse. There are times when the tank is not delivering enough damage to some mobs and nuking comes in handy. Sometimes my nuke can be the finishing blow that makes the mob turn to run or go snare frozen or even just kill it. But it ends the damage to the tank and allows me to med to give a better heal. I guess it's kindof hard to explain unless you are in the particular situaiton..<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">See, i'm glad to hear that i'm not the only one that kills people... I was starting to get a complex. I haven't hada lot of time to play lately so i was at 80% to get 52 for like two weeks, I had the time and energy to get on and get 52 yesterday, and the ranger in my guild that was helping me died probally 3 times the whole time I was with her. I felt so bad. With my horsey Bela and a KEI, and sometimes some nice shaman buffs i'm able to sit there and not only heal but nuke and I've started to use blinding luminance to build up my divination. Only when i'm doing really well on mana though. If i'm struggling to keep mana i sit there like a good girl and med while i wait to heal. Nuking and anything else i do never comes before healing. <br />
I usually do not like grouping with other cleric (though the higher level i get the better the other cleric are around me), because they are usually those people that arent clerics. they are people that have a main thats a straight melee and has 5 other alts. They do three things that drive me up a wall. (1) They superior heal the main tank at 80% always keep the mt 100% health until they have no mana, which is like a minute later. (2) If they do CH they start it at 60% and 99% of the time it lands on the tank when they are 50%.(I mean regular xping) (3) I ALWAYS announce my CH's. I have hot hotkeys made for all my heals, but a quick spot heal i don't always announce. When I cast a CH (usually around 35-45% depending on how fast the person is losing hp) the entire group can see it and its in ALL CAPS. The other dumb cleric does a superior heal on the person i'm CHing a whole secong before the CH hits so my CH hits the person and heals them the last 40% was useless and I've wasted mana. <br />
So as you can see my recipe for a bad cleric is a cleric that wastes mana. Your mana is your lifeline and your groups and if you are constantly without it then your in sad shape. Things happen and sometimes you need a lot of mana really fast and if you've just wasted a CH healing someone for 800hp and don't have the mana to save your group then you deserve to die not them. <br />
I don't honestly think I'm a good cleric. Its the complex I have. I always like watching a good cleric and seeing what they are doing right. Everyone good cleric i've seen knows when to heal who and never casts when unneccissary. I also think it comes to people. You aren't always gonna know when to cast, its something that u learn. I remember sitting in crushbone I was always trying to use every spell i had. I never had mana cuz i was constantly casting. Now i think what's up with that?!?!?! I've found that you don't always need to be casting. There are lots of times that you are sitting doing absolutely nothing but watching your group not lose hp, but there's lots of other times that you are casting away saving the day. I take the time i have sitting waiting for the perfect time to heal and i make my group laugh and enjoy themselves. I think that's another part of our job description.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Korlayne, you just hit on another point that I think is good for discussion: How a cleric works with other clerics.<br />
I learned from a good cleric that we could divide up healing duties. If there is more than one person who gets hit often each cleric is assigned one tank to take care of. And the clerics are assigned to heal eachother. That way if one cleric is getting hit, he/she isn't left being expected to heal him/herself. I've been in group where I was getting injured and someone in group said "Heal yourself!" and I was like "I can't! I'm getting interrupted".<br />
When we have a full group I usually pick the first 3 people in group to heal and let the other heal the next 3. So I can use function keys to easily target.<br />
If we only have one member who is taking alot of damage we take turns healing. One of us can get up and nuke or mele while the other heals. Or one heals and nukes while another meds and then the second cleric is backup healer. It can work well. I actually like grouping with other clerics bc it means I have a better chance of getting healed and it takes a little pressure off of me for the heals. If I need to run afk to the bathroom I can know that a healer is there to heal while I'm away (although I always announce my afks). If there is no other healer I will just hold it and ask the group not to pull for awhile if I really really have to go.<br />
You'll find that in the planes two clerics are a blessing. I've had to CH at 80% in some of the planes just bc the mobs delivered so much damage.<br />
A horsey? I wish I could afford one. I've never gotten close to that kind of coin. Never gotten even 4k. Don't feel bad about taking a couple weeks to get to 52. I took about a year. I was busy PLing people and tradeskilling. (My mother made me PL a few of her characters all the way to lvl 34 and I had to PL my two of my brother's characters to 40). <br />
Anyways, I just lost my train of thought... TV is distracting.. So, I'll shut up for now.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">While my cleric is only level 16, My shaman is 62, in a high end raiding guild.  Let me pass some of the things I see that EXCEPTIONAL clerics do.<br />
<br />
1.  Hot keys are your friend.<br />
   A.  Set up your hot key for your CH rotation to cast CH twice, with a (very) short pause between.  In the event of a fizzle on your first cast, the second cast will catch it, and CH is on the way faster than you can respond to the fizzle message and retap the key, or click with the mouse.<br />
   B.  You can also hotkey your heal call, so everything gets done at the same time.  Wouldnt be a bad idea to include /stand (or is it /sit off) to ensure that you dont forget to stand before you cast.   If a big raid, set up CH rotations and call your CH in channel, then call the next person to CH.  (example, somthing like "CH for %t.     Pause 40 &#123;4 second pause}(more or less depending on how tough the mob is)  Cleric x, heal now.)   This does 3 things.  Calls your CH, Casts your CH, and tells the next cleric to cast CH, all with one key stroke.<br />
   C.  Have a second and even third hotkey set up to quickly switch to second and third tanks in the event that MT goes down, or to extend rotation pause once slow lands.<br />
<br />
2.  Use channels, and set up a healer channel.  Use a noticable color, so you dont miss important messages.  Have all the clerics in the raid (or even druids, pallis, shamans, etc if needed) in that channel.  In a 72 person raid, the less message spam in main channels, the better.  If the MT wants to hear the CH calls, have him join the healer channel.<br />

3.  From a suport healers standpoint Shaman primary), my main job is to keep #1 my cleric alive so he/she can heal the MT,  #2 keep myself alive so I can heal the overnukeing wizzies or druids, or the resisted shamans and chanters, etc alive.  This only takes effect AFTER my primary class functions are complete.  Malo, slow etc.  I dont want my cleric to be distracted from their primary job of keeping the MT alive by having to spot heal other people.<br />
<br />
4.  Clerics MUST be organized, flexible, and able to adjust with the battle.  If the MT goes down, they have to instantly target and CH rotation on the secondary tank without missing a tic.  If slow is resisted, they need quick CHs on the MT.  If the mob is slowed, they need to increase the time between CH's so they dont go OOM before the mob is down.<br />
<br />
5.  Horsies can be great for mana recovery, but remember, if you just cast CH as the MT drops, you are stuck casting CH for the next 10 seconds.  Dont hesitate to click off Trigger so you can duck and get back into the action.<br />
<br />
6.  Know your enemys ahead of time.  Know what mobs you are going after, how much they hit for, and how fast.  Its too late when you show up at the gunfight armed with a knife.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is more I'll think of later, but dont want to get too drawn out.<br />

:1.  Hot keys are your friend.<br />
   A.  Set up your hot key for your CH rotation to cast CH twice, with a (very) short pause between.  In the event of a fizzle on your first cast, the second cast will catch it, and CH is on the way faster than you can respond to the fizzle message and retap the key, or click with the mouse.</td></tr></table><br />

   B.  You can also hotkey your heal call, so everything gets done at the same time.  Wouldnt be a bad idea to include /stand (or is it /sit off) to ensure that you dont forget to stand before you cast.   If a big raid, set up CH rotations and call your CH in channel, then call the next person to CH.  (example, somthing like &quot;CH for %t.     Pause 40 &#123;4 second pause}(more or less depending on how tough the mob is)  Cleric x, heal now.)   This does 3 things.  Calls your CH, Casts your CH, and tells the next cleric to cast CH, all with one key stroke.<br />
<br />
   C.  Have a second and even third hotkey set up to quickly switch to second and third tanks in the event that MT goes down, or to extend rotation pause once slow lands.<br />
<br />
2.  Use channels, and set up a healer channel.  Use a noticable color, so you dont miss important messages.  Have all the clerics in the raid (or even druids, pallis, shamans, etc if needed) in that channel.  In a 72 person raid, the less message spam in main channels, the better.  If the MT wants to hear the CH calls, have him join the healer channel.<br />

Having a second cleric in your group can be awesome. The most important thing is COMMUNICATION!. Know who you are responsible for healing. Make a heal channel if you have more than one group or are in a raid. I was in an awesome group in Velks the other day. 2 clerics, 1 chanter, 1 warrior, 2 Sk's. We rocked for 4 hours. I took the warrior and one SK (and the cleric). The other cleric took the Sk, chanter and me.<br />
<br />
Ask group if they wanted heals called out. Every group is different. Know the MAX HP of your tank completely buffed out. Watch the first battle to see how hard he is being hit. I (being a 51 cleric) was grouped with a good RL friend (52 Warrior). In some places I needed to CH at 40% others not till he was at 20%. It depends on how much he is being hit. <br />
<br />
Know your own limitations. What is the max you can heal for and how fast can you cast it. Watch the health bar of everyone in your group during the fight, the bard or chanter might have gotten agro and need a quick heal. I usually keep 3 heals up at one time. Celestial, Remedy, and Complete. I also have the THurgadin greaves for Word of Health. Keep root and stun loaded. I have found in my adventures that asking the group what they expect or want is best. Everyone has different playing styles. I have been called a bad cleric, I have been called an awesome cleric. It is all a matter of opinion. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Now, I wasn't saying that I entirely hate grouping with other clerics. I've loved a few clerics I've grouped with. I've found it to be a learning exerience. I also love knowing that i'll get a heal and if I can't get a heal off cuz i'm being pounded that there's someone else there to save my group. I've had to zone a lot to save myself and then as your zoning you are praying that your group is still alive... I hate that. There are those clerics though. I've gotten in groups with some before that i send them a tell asking how they want to handle it and get told to either sit there, that the group doesn't need me, or they flat out ignore me. And those are the ones that are Oom like 30 sec into a fight. Groups of more than one cleric are great, but like KimmyKay said communication is necissary.</td>
