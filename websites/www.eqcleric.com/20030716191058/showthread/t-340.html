<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">SMC3 I wish I had done this myself. It saves 15% mana on EVERY spell you cast. I looked at what was a prereq on other Class specific and went with Crit heal because every Class type that had a prereq had crit heals as it's prereq. What a waste actually. I will prolly not get any of those MGB does not have any prereq other than 12points in Arch. So if you want to go after MGB Right away the go SMC3(12points) the MGB(9points) then look at what else you want. As for after you get Run3 I have many say add to stamina to increase your HP. It is not as easy to find a Sta/Mana item as Wis/mana item. But for that I think it is all personal prefrence. Anyways, as I think anyone can tell you i never take the short way of telling you anything :p But Hope that helps hehe.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">SCM3 I believe to be the single most beneficial AA there is, at least for a caster's mana pool.  I know the feeling is shared by most, if not all, casters of my acquaintence.  Yeah, it takes a total of 12 points, but they are well spent points.<br />
<br />
After that... I think it just depends what you are doing with your character.  I went for MGB, as it was far easier on large (50 - 70 people) raids to have to use 8 peridots and a half bar of mana to Aego the raid than simply doing it by the group - or *shudder* as was the case before anyone got Hand of Virtue, individually.<br />
<br />
I went for reinforcement then, Aego that lasts 4 1/2 hours is far superior in my mind than Aego that lasts for 3 hours - I got so buffed out in the days before Aego, casting three buffs on everyone for 60 levels.<br />
<br />
Then I chose healing gift, as at the time PoP was on the distant horizon and I had no idea that the PoP abilities would so outshine the class abilities as to make class - well, worthless, IMO - I won't be an Exarch until that point in time that I feel I have 7 points just to toss away.<br />
<br />
In PoP, I'm working on adding to my wisdom pool, 3 points at a time /rolleyes - while also adding other really useful abilities:  <br />
<br />
Radient Cure:  I have this at level 3; it is amazing.  It cures the group.  It cures virtually everything.  Curses from the top Luclin mobs, diseases from the Crypt of Decay; it even cures Malo.  <br />
<br />
Divine Arbitration:  Wow.  No time for a CH to hit?  Mash that hotkey - unbelievable.  The dying one's life goes up, everyone else goes down - toss on an EE and get back to healing the tank.  Game altering ability.<br />
<br />
Unfailing Divinity:  Increase the percentage that your death-pact type spells work.  You say "death pact is a waste of a pearl," and I agree completely.  Divine Intervention, however, I've seen save the same tank's life twice in one encounter.  Our MTs even get charisma buffs to help their chances.  At a cost of two emeralds per cast, and a duration of 10 minutes, it is well worth the chance to not have to switch MTs mid-fight in some of those endurance tests that Verant has given us.<br />
<br />
That's just what's in my immediate game-plan.  So many abilities... so little actual experience time :p</td>

oh and definatly get run3 it is a must have. it is great for dongeons when there is no sow. also has saved me so many times i can't even count. one time latly was in PoD in LCY, we got a supper bad pull, no one had sow, two of us made it to the zone, we both had run3. on that pull the mobs came out of thin air, the pathing can sure be bad out there, but the exp is just soo nice, i get like almost 3% aa every two kills.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I know everyone has different goals in the game, some like you Dingalin dont' want to out level friends and such and thats totally honorable.  There are more reasons but,<br />
<br />
In General terms,  it is by far to your advantage to get Levels prior to getting AA exp.  Mainly because post 60 spells are infinitly more valuable than their predacessors... <br />
<br />
for example.. Remedy is a decent heal Early in your 50's but I would wager that 9 out of 10 level 60 clerics never memorize it.   Because its far to small of a heal to do much more than quickly erase 1 rounds worth of damage.  <br />
The 61 heal, Supernal remedy, is Highly Valuable.. even in the Tier 3 planes where I have been spending alot of time. <br />
<br />
Why? because its so fast 1.8 seconds and heals a substantial amount.. No better heal for saving your caster rogue bard.. or you own butt.  Specially when you get some nasty aggro from an unslowed mob wailing on yah for 500-700 damage. <br />
<br />
Its the same for most of the spells.. Virtue 400 more hp than Aego,  nukes with some decent mana/damage ratio(well for clerics anyway)... new quick stuns.. the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Level > AA<br />

<br />
Once you go down into the jail area and beyond, however, stuff is dark blue.  Juggs, shrooms, Ilis frogs - all dark blue.  Pretty decent experience as well, even at 65.  Fun to do, because one cannot help remembering when it took 3 - 4 groups to camp that fortress area before Trak's lair.  Now one group and easy kills.  Protector's a wuss.  Reets are just frogs.  Nasty, stingy frogs - they didn't drop that crown for the Wood Elf mask /rolleyes <br />
<br />
CT... I'm afraid I've not even been in that zone since PoP.  But stuff there was close enough to 60 before; I'd have a hard time imagining it not being dark blue.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73"><font color="darkred">hey all...just need some advice...I'm level 60 and have aquired a copy of the spell Virtue which is lvl 62. What I was wondering is should I stay at 60 and get some needed AA's cause all I have right now is Run 3 and Innate Metabolism or should I go on to 62 then start on AA's again ? I also have most of my lvl 61 spells..well the important ones. There is only one thing that's holding me back...I am not in a guild that can get me any flags to be able to fight in higher places..I have a flag to POV but I don't know of any where else that i can fight if i go to 62 besides PoV, PoN, and PoI...I was lucky in getting the flag for PoV. My husbands guild needed a cleric for one of thier many runs and I got to go. I hope to soon be joining the guild cause I was once a member and left on good terms. I just have to wait till I can get the money to get my own computer cause thier Probation period is intense. So I'm thinkin that I should go on to 62 then work on AA's but I just want to make sure that I will have plenty of places to fight and still get good exp. I think that the AA's would help me out a lot though also. Unless I'm wrong in this assumption Keyera and I are in the same boat. That's why I was thinking to just go to 62 becuase I do have a flag for PoV and from what I hear its good exp there up to 65 too? Not sure on that one. The only reason I guess I'm really asking is cause I don't really have any good AA's yet that are class specific and I hear they help out tons. Not sure. Any help is appreciated(hugs) </font> /confused</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Currently if you have the flag to PoV, you should also be flagged for Plane of  Storms.  In eigther case these 2 places provide xp that is by far the best in the game for leveling past 60.  <br />
<br />
Xp in 61  and 62 slows to a trickle in the tier 1 planes, most common mobs become light blue to you there and makes it very difficult to get any reasonable reward for your time there.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the spells you get at these levels are far and away so much better than their predacessors that the jump to these 2 levels is highly desired.<br />
<br />
On prexus in particular, Plane of Valor is one of the major 61+ xp zones with plenty of opportunity to massive xp.  A camp known as outer caves is known for some of the best xp there is... even when compared to tier 3 zones.</td>

<br />
I'm currently 54 and in a fairly large raiding guild.  I'm also the lowest level raiding cleric.  My plan is to get run3 and probably something else at 55 ( would like to be a baroness ) and then level until 60 where I can spend my time gaining more AAs.<br />
<br />
Now given my situation, would you say that I should still wait until 65 to start AAs?</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">to those of you that say that you have no access to spells, you need to think about what you are saying. If you dont pay for your spells, you need to get them as drops. If you are only hunting in tier 1 and old world of course you dont have your spells, that isn't where they drop. You can easily get your spells in tier 2/3 planes, which everyone is able to get flagged for. Every trial group needs a cleric, so join one or make one. Saying you want to exp in the old stuff is just rediculous. Killing in Seb is not exp, its farming plat. The rate that exp comes in in tier 2 and higher planes is so much faster than the old stuff that there are very few good reasons to stay behind.<br />
<br />
So your guild has events in old stuff? Big deal you can still go. Then spend 5 minutes in pov making up the exp you would have got if you were still level 65. Lets rap it up:<br />
Stay at level 60, get really slow exp, no spells and no possibility for advancement.<br />
Level to 65 before doing aa: Get spell drops through normal exp grouping, make aa's a ton faster than you would at 60, and fight in fun/challenging zones.<br />
<br />
Why is it so tough to understand? Move on, if you need plat, go farm it. If you need exp, level up and start making aa's in under 2 hours while getting those spells that you need.</td>

<br />
it is nice to get exp, as you farm, it is nice to play with friends, and get exp, it is nice to go on mini raids with friends and get exp. and at lvl 60, teir one in PoP sitll gives over 1% aa per kill. so if i was lvl 65, i would be stuck in PoP teir two or higher and only be able to get exp there, and would also be stuck in pick-up groups. it is fine to be lvl 65 if all your friends are. and i was told aa exp in teir two is about the same as teir one.<br />
<br />
so to each his own. was great to go into seb this weekend with 3 friends and in 2 hours i got 15% aa and 1k plat. now if i had been lvl 65, would of got no exp. i eeded to farm to support mt tradeskills, so i would of been doing it anyway, the exp was a bonus that i wouldn't of got if i was lvl 65.<br />

While i agree level is greater then AA in general it does not work out to be best for everyone.<br />
<br />
I have thrown together a few PoV groups for the caves and the crystaline golemns mainly, but unfortunately in the evenings PoV is jammed packed with people and on weekdays anyway our time is usually broken up into 2-3 hour sessions which means taking 30-40 mins to form a group, wait for everyone to get there etc really cuts into our playtime. Consequently 85% of my experience gathering is spent duoing with my wifes ranger.<br />
<br />
We have tried duoing in PoS and PoV but it has not panned out so we rely on gaining experience in tier 1 zones, mainly PoJ. Once we finish up a few of her aa's however we can duo in HoH (endless quiver and archery 1) which i have done with another guild ranger. She just hit veteran status last night so we are 14aa from our goal. Lol it has been tough the last 2 months to be 1 blue bubble of experience from 61st but we know if we hold off till we get those aa we will be much better off.<br />
<br />
I believe the type of guild (and members) that you belong too also dictates which aa skills you may be interested in to some degree. Currently we kill veeshans, sleepers, Ntov and Aerin dar in PoV. There are several clerics in our guild and in regards to total aa i come in about 3rd (a very distant third). We have 2 clerics that are almost always on and have over 100 aa each including MGB and are at every raid so i didnt really need to get it. As a result i went for aa's that would benefit our exp duoing rather then raid function.<br />
<br />
RUN 3<br />
WIS 5<br />
SCM 3<br />
MC 1<br />
CF 1<br />
HG 1<br />
CA 1<br />
4 aa curently banked towards RC1, DA1, IE1, PP1 which will take a total of 10aa. This way i can get them as soon as we decide to level to 61st. I am also strongly debating dropping 3aa into metabolism as i would like to cut less of a swath through stat food.<br />
<br />
Personally the class abilities dont really have any draw for me.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Theres a few ways to look at this, And most of this is in my very humble view of "the grand scheme".<br />
<br />
Way back in the day, Life was good and easy. But then came Kunark, and then Velious, and then (god forbid that patch day never happen again!) Luclin *shudders*. <br />
<br />
60 Was the highest level limit now, and people did Everything Verant threw at them(yes it was haarrrddd!). So guess what that means. It means you can do it at 60 to. But they had a mass load of AA's to do it with. So are pre-pop mobs doable without leveling past 60? Yup Yup! been done before can be done again.<br />
<br />
Then came Planes of Power, and whoa boy. The power these "exp" mobs showed us. Having to start Complete Heals at over 70% health just to keep the main tank up! Slows being required for EVERY fight. life got hard, hoo-boy it got hard. do you see many level 60's in PoV/PoS lfg? and how long will they be there? because no one really wants them? Think about the Trial of Execution! it was made to push the limits of any group and FORCE you to play good. But alas, The gods failed in keeping The lower levels from being "pulled" through. Anyways, i'm rambling to much. my point here is this.<br />
<br />
I believe in leveling to 65 before you even start on your AA's(except run 3, get this ASAP!) It's a matter of prestige`, It's a matter of Showing you have the skill,It's the matter of showing people you Work for what you want! I wont even get into the fact of Resists, Skill ups, Spells, AC, HP, Mana Pool, Fizzle chances, AA abilities Unlocked 61+!, Because anyone can figure this stuff out, right?<br />
<br />
This is my opinion. I am currently level 65(trust me, get to 62 and get in PoV, and the word of the day is "Grind" that EXP) and you'll break through to Archon Faster than you think. Not only that but you'll be happy to shout 65 Cleric LFG, or 65 Cleric at your service! Alternate Abilities are great, they are god, they make us more useful and they make us VERY VERY productive in raids, But listen close, because here comes the point of this whole ramble session(wow i'm chatty today!) AA's dont make us cleric's. Levels dont make us cleric's. We chose the harder path in EQ, We cant Aye on Super weapons, or awesome armor, we dont worry about attack, or ac(well not till "end game") We are the healer's, Complete heal makes us, The Remedy line of spells make us, The elixer line makes us, But most importantly of all. <br />
<br />
SKILL MAKES US. Play well, Play smart, Play hard, After you do this you sit back and bask in the glory that all those melee couldnt have done jack crud without us! <br />
<br />
I love you all, For the path you have chosen and the Healing you do everyday for people who dont appreciate us! Until we meet In game, or speak to each other Server Wide. I will remain Faithfully Every one of yours,<br />
