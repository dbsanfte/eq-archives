<br />
This quest starts on the top floor of the library in the Plane of Knowledge, in the council chamber. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Councilman Srethix.' <br />
<br />
Councilman Srethix regards you with narrow eyes, then smiles. 'Greetings. I am Councilman Srethix of Kartis. It is good to see some new visitors to our little corner of the cosmos. I certainly hope you can find what you are looking for here in the Myrist library. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that I am quite busy seeking some rare books at the moment, and I do not have much time for light conversation. Otherwise, I believe my aid Garuuk may have some chores he could use help with. That is, if you feel up to it.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What rare books? <br />
<br />
Councilman Srethix glares at Garuuk and turns back to you. 'You are interested in a job seeking knowledge, yes? Very well, I think I may have something suitable for you. I happen to be seeking an ancient tome containing some valuable information about artifacts of power. I have learned this book is somewhere in our very own library but so far Garuuk has been unable to locate it. Find me the Tome of Dark Power and I may see what other jobs I can pass along to you.' <br />
<br />
The book he speaks of is the "Locked Tome of Dark Power" -- a ground spawn at +50, +1050, -60 (bottom of a shelf). Return this book to Srethix. <br />
<br />
Councilman Srethix says 'Very impressive, this little tome has eluded my aid for quite some time now. How good of you to discover its whereabouts and bring it to me. But from the looks of it, this book has a strong, magically-sealed lock upon its cover. I wonder if Elder Tal Almad would know how to break it? Take this to him in the Plane of Tranquility and let him have a look at it. If he can open it, bring it back to me.' <br />
<br />
Go into the Plane of Tranquility and find Elder Tal Almad. <br />
<br />
Elder Tal Almad says 'Welcome traveler, are you here to meet with someone or are you new to this place?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am here to meet with someone.' (Doesn't look like you have to talk to him really.) <br />
<br />
Elder Tal Almad says 'Well then, if you do not need my assistance, I will continue my work. May you find that which you seek.' <br />
<br />
Elder Tal Almad looks the book over carefully, 'This is a most interesting find indeed. You seek to break the seal that surrounds this tome? This may take some time, please be patient.' As he waves his hand over the lock and mumbles a few syllables, the clasp instantly falls open. With a surprised look he says, 'That was odd, the seal was easier to break then I thought it would be. It's almost. . . Well, it's almost as if the book had a will to be opened. I sense much power inside this tome, you best be careful with it.' He hands the book back to you. <br />
<br />
Back to PoK. <br />
<br />
Councilman Srethix says 'It's good to see my instincts about the Elder were correct.' He opens the book, begins thumbing through the pages, and frowns. 'What's this? Some pages are missing, eight of them to be exact. I'm afraid this book will be of no use to me without those pages. You can have it. I wonder what happened to them, whomever had this book before must have removed them for some reason. If you find the missing pages somewhere, be sure to close them up inside the book and return it to me. ' <br />
<br />
The book is a container at this point so have a slot open. <br />
<br />
Casting the spell Identify reveals "Item Lore: Missing pages 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19.." <br />
<br />
The Pages of Dark Power drop randomly in tier one Planes (ie Nightmare, Innovation, Justice).<br />
<br />
<br />
this is a very easy quest, i have done it twice already, and i never went out of my way to do it, it was just normal exp grind. i found i got most of my pages in PoI, it seems they were more common there.<br />

This quest starts in PoT<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Jimlok Keylifter'  <---- he is located on top of stairs near entrance to PoN<br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Well met, traveler. Can I be of assistance to you? Can't say as I got much to do at the moment. I'm just attending to a little fishing while I wait on my friend to get back to me. Hopefully he doesn't keep me waiting for too much longer. I can only stand so much of this place.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what friend' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'This is the situation. My friend Gilor Swiftfoot and I were going to try our hand at breaking into the Plane of Justice. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you're thinking that's silly and all, but how many people do you know of that can say they've broken out of the Eternal Prison, let alone in? 'None', right? So, we were all ready to go in when I got word that something else needed re-appropriating all quick like. I told Gilor to wait until I got back, but no. He had to run off, eager as always and as patient as a gust of wind. Now, I think he's in trouble.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what trouble' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'People here seem to think that he tried to make the prison break by himself. They've found another way in, so maybe he took that route. I'd like to check on him, but if he isn't in there, I'm liable to get myself in trouble. I think I'd be much better off staying here and waiting for him. If you want to go look for him, I'd be quite grateful. I doubt you have the skills to get far in there. You don't look like the burglarizing type, but I'd even be willing to give you the document that I picked up on my last job if you look for him.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what document' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Don't you worry about that unless you bring me some word of Gilor's condition. Trust me, it's a strange and mysterious document. Just the sort of thing you adventuring types love. Find Gilor and it's all yours, I give you my word.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'i will look for him' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'Alright, friend, you need to be on the lookout for a gnome about my height, with one bad leg. He's got a bit of a limp, but he's still a hard one to chase down. If you can't find him, be on the lookout for anything that resembles a small bottle. He's got a way with rodents; so if you see some little pest carrying a bottle of some sort, grab him! It will most likely be a message for me. Bring it back immediately. It won't be of any use to you anyway, since you can't read our code. Be quick and good luck!' <br />
<br />
Go get a bottle with a note in it from &#8220;a festering rat&#8221; in Plane of Justice. <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter sighs deeply as he hands you an intricate schematic of some device. The notation on the document is written in a strange language that is completely foreign to you. 'This doesn't bode well for Gilor. He says he's found a secret tunnel and he's going to go in deeper. I guess I'll go in and find him if he doesn't return soon. Well, a deal is a deal. Here is the document that I mentioned.' <br />
<br />
Jimlok Keylifter says 'The person that I was supposed to lift it for was a jeweler of sorts, but he mainly dealt in mechanical devices. I wasn't able to track him down to get my coin, so I don't know what you'll do with it. Maybe my cousin Tabben will give you something for it. He's got himself a little tinker's shop in the Jeral section of New Tanaan. Show him the map thingy and see what he says.' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal (he is found in the building behind the area of the soulbinder in PoK, second floor, same building as the forges on the first floor) says 'What is it? What do you wan. . . Oh bloody underfoot, do forgive me, traveler. I'm not used to all this bickering and flittering about -- you know, the bustle of the 'living' city. The racket, the noise, and the wails of the children. Bah! I came here to escape it, not to relive it. But if I survived it once, I sure as Brell's holy bottom will do it again! In hopes of getting you all out of here as soon as possible and the peace and quiet being resurrected out of your blessed absence, I've agreed to lend some of my knowledge of the more inferior levels of tinkering to those who have an interest in this art. If you don't intend on purchasing any materials, then be off with you and leave me in peace. However, if you have coin in your pocket and you plan on spending, then do so quickly. I have more pressing things to do with my time than wait while you leisurely browse my wares.' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal takes the document from you and looks at it for a moment. 'Well, this is a beautiful looking schematic. I wonder what they are trying to make with it? Where did you get this? No wait; don't tell me. I'd rather not know. I can make some of this writing out but just barely. What I can read leads me to believe that I'd be better off not knowing.' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal falls victim to his curiosity and grabs a small kit from the table behind him. 'Take this kit and look for the following parts,' he says as he scrunches his nose at the schematic again. 'We'll need a Tri-coated Metal Casing, one Size C spring, some Creeping silk strands -- whatever those are -- and some Congealed Bile-based Ooze. I'm not sure if this thing is wanting us to make a device or some sort of nasty ****tail, but that's what it's asking for... ewww!' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal says 'Seal those things up in the <br />
container that I just gave you and bring it straight back to me. I'll wait here for you and see if I can decipher anymore of this schematic.' <br />

Tri- Coated Metal Casing &#8211; Random in PoI , <br />

Tabben Bromal says 'Oh, you've returned! Very good, Tiggil! Saria and I have made some real progress on the document that you brought us. Watch this and you'll see what I mean!' <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal quickly opens the small case and removes the parts. He takes a tiny spanner, several small bolts, and a long wire and quickly pieces together what appears to be a small clockwork talisman. He pulls a leather string through the top of it and offers it to you. <br />
<br />
This gets you the &#8220;Small Clockwork Talisman&#8221; <br />
<br />
Tabben Bromal says 'That should work for you, but from what we gathered, there's another layer of mechanics that works to shield and envelope the existing talisman. It's going to require more parts. So take this container and let me know when you're ready to write down the names of the next set of parts<br />

both of these quests are very easy, the tailsman one is a bit harder as one of the parts, the "tri metal casing" only drops off the spiders in PoI, and as there are not too many spiders, this rare drop becomes harder to get as the there are not that many mobs in the first place. the other parts of the tailsman are pretty easy to get, kill the low lvl spiders in PoN for bile, the ooze things in PoD for strands. and in PoI just about any of the mobs for size c spring. and remember!!! as you are doing these quests, you are doing normal exp !!!!! so turn that exp grind into a quest!!! and you can work on both at the same time! oh, and the bottle in PoJ for tailsman is a very comon drop off the rats.<br />
<br />
well i hope this may help someone with the quest blues.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Both quests are fairly easy, but don't expect to get through them in a hurry.  The Casing is a rare drop of a semi-rare MoB, and the drop rate on the pages is very low as well, and you need alot of different ones.  They are fairly easy because you can do them as you're XP'ing, but don't expect to get them done in one night.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">the reason i called them easy quest is because ya realy don't need to go out of your way to do them. and yes i do belive they "nerfed" the drop rates on the pages. i remember getting tons of them when PoP first came out. enough that i completed the cloak of wise twice.<br />
