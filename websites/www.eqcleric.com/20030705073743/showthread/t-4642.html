I remember back when I was in my younger levels and I would rezz someone and they would offer me a donation for my time, but I would always say no donations needed. Now when rezzing someone in Planar zones it's like common practice. They always say thank you, but really don't donate anymore, which is fine with me because I never accept donations, but the thought that counts. I guess when you get into higher levels everyone helps everyone out in one way or another.<br />

<br />
My guild decides to visit the new Plane of Hate, so we port on up there right into the middle of 20 corpses and a FD'ed SK.  I heal up the SK, who asks if I can rez their cleric to speed up their CR and save the cost of porting him back there.  Sure, no problem, clr is rezzed and he starts bringing back their raid force.  <br />
<br />
As I said, we've not been there before so we're pulling to the zone in to get a feel for the place, and we had told these guys were going to do this.  Once their force is all rezzed they tell us how they don't appreciate us moving in on their camp, to please leave PoH!  <br />
<br />
We start working our way south, just to move away from these clowns, and get into a nice little groove (two Gems of Faith!!).  Naturaly the other raid group wipes and wants rezzed again!  Can you say "HA!"<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: forget getting a thanks or a donation, just be grateful they don't demand you leave "their" zone after you've rezzed them.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
PS: unlike the old PoH, the new one can easily support multiple lower level raid forces, and actually would be a good place to exp grind for a good group in the high 50's.  We had three raid groups working different parts of the north and central portion of the zone and didn't interfere with one another at all (once we dispersed from the entrance)</td>

If they're on and want the rez I don't mind. I mean I'm standing there doing nothin cept waiting on a group so its not all that much. Now if I have to run from PoK to Droga, I better get well paid. If a raid party wipes, common practice of mine is to go ahead and rez them, /shrug maybe I'm too nice but it sure made a lot of Casus Belli guildmates happy I was there to rez them. Didn't have anything better to do. Unless a person states up front that they're paying, you can expect nil, nothing, nada. Donations are always nice but don't expect them. If someone wants a rez and I'm in a group, drag the corpse to me. As for that wiped PoH raid, if they asked me to rez them after they had told me to please leave their zone.

You know...<br />

A cleric friend and guildmate of mine made a comment to me the other night, after a really intense raid we had.<br />
<br />
One of the pullers, who we were grouped with, said "wow, people sent me tells thanking me for pulling" To which my cleric friend replied "You know...no one ever thanks us for healing them :( "<br />
<br />
It kinda struck a chord. No one ever thanks the healers for rezzing, and doing their job after a big raid...</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">That's a good point Dys.  I generally get thanked after rezzing when we wipe, but I don't expect it.  What I do expect, is when I go out of my way to rez someone, a simple thank you is all I want. When someone drags a corpse to me (usually without asking first ), & asks me to rez their friend.. A simple thank you from the person I rez is all the payment I expect. I never take donations (yeah, it shows in my pocketbook).  There have been many times I've been asked to rez, & the person I rez just walks away without even acknowledging I did them a favor. those are the people who end up on my no-rez list.  It really isn't that hard to type /t gwenevieve thank you for the rez, I appriciate it.  When anyone does anything for me (drive by buffing, casting sow, Kei, or whatever, I always send that person a tell thanking them.<br />

What is that? Is it so hard to type the words "Thank you"? I mean, if you really are "thankful" for something, wouldn't you have the common courtesy to type the actual word out?<br />
<br />
I know, it's small and maybe petty. I just find it irksome that people, in general, lack the manners to be truely polite. When I ask for buffs, etc, I'm anal, so I type out complete sentences, and say please and thank you. <br />

I'd almost rather no thanks at all, if the thanks I get is gonna be "leet speak shorthand"./rant off</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I logged on yesterday and didn't feel like going for xp so I figured I'd try to get my spells and such, maybe go help out some lower level guildies. I go into the bazaar and search for my spells... Wake of tranquility 3700pp UGH! Okay screw this people wanna charge that much it's time to make it by rezzing their sorry asses! I gate back to PoK and setup a funny hotkey and WHAM right away I get this tell "my group wiped in PoI could you come rez us for 1k?" If I wasn't already sitting I would have fallen on my ass. <br />
<br />
On my way to PoI I get 3 more tells for single rezzes and I respond that I'm doing a bunch and I'll send them a tell when I get done to see if they still need me. These people actualy waited like 20 minutes for me. And all of them were falling over themseves thanking me over and over! I get back to PoK and a few people send me tells but say they're broke, no sweat man! where the corpse? More falling over themselves thanking me. Then I get a CoM raid that wants to give me 1k to come rez them all. More falling over themselves thanking me. It took so long to get everyone rezzed they started buffing me!<br />
<br />
So right now I'm thinking the word "donation" means "fall over saying thank you, hug/kiss me to death and fill all my buff slots"<br />
<br />
There was so much gratitude that I'd run into someone I'd rezzed earlier in another zone and they'd start /ooc'ing thanks and "numo's the best" I felt so much love for what amounted to me saying "pay me and I'll rez you" even though I did do a lot of free rezzes and I was running by corpses. Was fun anyway, got to see a bunch of zones I hadn't been to before. <br />

And damn do I need a Vanishing Device. Went through 2 bags of cloudy potions! I also got my Wake of Tranquility spell WOOOT!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I used to be one that subscribed to the "no donations, ever." train of thought when rezzing people. I was a cleric dammnit, and I wanted to be pious and whatnot and goodwill toward men and whatever you can think of a priest bieng. (not counting the petophile part/uhoh )<br />
<br />
Anyway, the day came when I realized. . . "uh, oh. I just might have to buy a whole stack of peridots!" A couple levels pass by and i'm carrying a small bag full. Now this costs money as you all know and quickly turns into a permanent money sink for us all.<br />
I figured when I hit my 50's money was coming in at a reasonable rate and I could afford some of the small luxuries like the occasinal KEI. Make no mistake, on FV the regular payment for this spell is 50pp and up. People pay this money and SMILE, Now why oh why couldn't someone afford to pay me at least 50pp for my saving them at least an hour's worth of exp'ing saved?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong , I don't think I've become jaded. I still do most of my level 45 and lower rezzes for free. But when you have to go rez someone in a dangerous zone or have to travel your butt off to do it I think its worth any high level players time to make a small donation, I never ask for it, but I have to say I do feel bugged after a long run only to get handed 12pp /dead.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, sure greatfulness is always nice, but rezzing to me has become a business to fund my Dot's and nothing more, Time is money, and a quick thanks in the way of PP is all the thanks i need anymore.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Yeah... Sunday night and tonight all I did was go around rezzing people. Just sit in the rez channel and shout in PoK. In 2 3-4 hour session I pulled in ~10k enough to finish off most of my 55 and 56 spells along with getting a bag full of peridots (most I ever had before was 2-3 stacks!) At first I felt like crap taking the money but after what some of these people wanted... 5 zones away running all the way, dropping the Cloudy Potions like pods of water I feel better about it.  What I will do though is if I see a corpse on the way I stop for a second and rez it and continue on.<br />
<br />
I still drop them and not accept anything if I'm there. Some people are so scared to ask for a rez when they don't have anything. Those are the people that come back the next day remembering me and shout nice things about me in the zone.<br />
<br />
Plus after looking at future spell prices that people want in the bazaar.. Screw that they can pay for a rez!  Only time I scoffed was when I ran 4 zones to rez one person and when I got there his group needed rezzing and he gave me 100gp, yes gold pieces, and he conned red to me.<br />
<br />
I still stick by my "have em pay and they fall over themselves thanking you" cuz 99% of the rezzes I've done in past couple days that's exactly what happened!</td>

I was in Lake Rathetear the other day, working on the beginning of my epic.  I got a tell from a Level 48 Mage that had made an error in judgement in testing out a new AE spell near the gnolls at the zone to SK.<br />
<br />
So, I run over there after I'm done with what I was doing and rez him.  He gets 49 back (a spell level, in case that aspect is missed), and all I get is a thanks.  Yes, at least he gave me a "thanks", but I'd like to think his level, and more importantly, the spells it returned access to would be worth something to him.  Looking at his gear AND the fact that most folks know how good at farming mages are, I know he could have afforded even 50pp.<br />
<br />
I've often considered putting it upfront with someone I am doing a rez for (outside of my guild, its allies, friends and guildmates, of course); I'll list the percentage rezzes available from me and the minimum I expect in return for them.  Will I make friends with that person?  Nope.  Will it make me lose sleep at night?  Nope.<br />

As was mentioned in a previous post, people eagerly fork over decent plat for KEI, Aego, Virtue, PotG, Pot9, F07, etc, yet get incredibly stingy when it comes to compensating us for saving them time.<br />

You see enchanters all the time sitting in PoK casting KEI with "donations appreciated". Now I know you can give them whatever, but here they are spending their time casting for other people. At least make it worth their while for sitting there. If a cleric is going to traverse a zone/zones to rez someone, at least make it worth their while! Surely there is something better the cleric can be doing with their time. I know I don't have all the time in the world. Corpses you come upon during everyday travel is an exception of course and no payment should be expected.<br />
<br />
That 100gp is almost a slap in the face. Unless that's all they had at the time and access to a bank was far away. Maybe I'm just tired and crusty.<br />
<br />
I remember when I was level 14 when I just received Reanimation and I was in Nektulos Forest when someone asked for a rez. I told them I can resurrect them but for 0% xp. He said fine, corpse is at the south end. I ran down and the corpse was his own! I cast, he repositioned next to his corpse then he gave me 2pp lol. I guess he wanted to know what it felt like. Pretty good coin at the time.<br />

The necro shows up buts hes still not there, I'm like "Hello, dude I'm rezzing, hoping to go get some expierence soon." He says he'll brt..

I only have a 60% res, so I dont get asked often. But when I do get asked its completely free. I dont accept donations at all (except return buffs) and will happily tell the person "just a thanks is enough".<br />
This may change when I get higher res if I have to spend my time going to help people though, then I may accept donations (but not ask for them).<br />

My rant is of people who want your help, then dont want your help. This happened to me a few times, but most noteably just recently.<br />
I have two clerics at level 40, myself (dark elf) and my evil brother (high elf). Though my evil brother is not really played anymore.<br />
The other night I was waiting for some guildys in PoK when a guy starts calling in /ooc that he needed buffs for a CR.<br />
So I sent him a tell "where is your corpse I may be able to res it for you" he told me his corpse was in HHK. So I told him that I can res for 60%, is that ok? I said that if that is ok could he arrange for an invis for me as Im KoS there.<br />
He ummd and ahhhd about getting an invis (I should have taken the hint then) and we tried to work around the problem. Eventually I just said to him, "look its ok, I also have a high elf, Ill log him in and meet you at the rivervale stone".<br />
So off I go to get my evil brother. My twin pops in and sends the guy a tell, he said he is waiting for me. So I run to the Rivervale stone and say hi. No response. I tell him to invite me, which he does and then in group say I here him say "wow cool Ive just managed to find another res, for 93%"........<br />

Heh, on the few occasions I've gotten rezzed or the slightly more often I look for rezzes for guildies, the subject of "What Percent?" never even comes up (unless we happen to know we have a friend in bound with a high percent rez. Happened once so far)<br />

And the few times I've turned down a rez, it was because I had just been reKEId and decided that the KEI was worth more than the XP loss and running time. I still thank them for the offer, though.<br />

Got him to level 8.5 last night between E Commons and FoB. Right now I am just giving him the 49 Shammy buffs and letting him run out and gather a few reds, then pull 'em back to the Troll to kill (so if it does go south, I can send in OldYeller to end the fight quickly).<br />
<br />
I figure I'll get him to 20 or so then start grouping him up to learn the nuances of being a full blown Cleric. I'm thinking that <20 his only group job is healing and assisting the Tank....both things I know very well from my Shaman. Does this sound reasonable? (Keeping in mind that my Shaman usually ends up being the healer for the group since my guild tends to be melee heavy)<br />
<br />
Heh, the hardest part is going to be learning mana management for Clerics now that I can't KEI him. I may have to reverse PL a bard for manasong...Or pull the enchanter out of storage and get him up to Clarity level. Definitely need to see about a Earring of the Solstice.<br />
<br />
...and he finally has a name...Duhikae!<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to being able to go set up an Aid Station in a few weeks. Park and camp my Necro with a inventory full of coffins, bring in the Shammy and Cleric and sit somewhere hellish like Paludal helping out for a few hours.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I set up an CLERIC AID STATION and SAND GIANT EXTERMINATION service in Oasis one time a while back. Had C3 and a buddy parked his bard at the docks to help me out while he was gone.  Had a blast buffing/healing everyone in Oasis... which is fairly empty these days.  The ocassional SG kill made things interesting too... oh, and pulling a spec to the docks and keeping him rooted nearby to scare people.. sorry Endo.. was fun too.  <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, after my spouting off before. I thought I owed it to the person involved to tell of a very positive experience I had last night.<br />
I was sitting in PoK once again, had just logged on and was waiting for a guildy to drive past for some swapping of gear. When I noticed somone OOCing for a res.<br />
I send the person a tell (anonymous, so I had no idea what he would expect) and told him that I can offer him a 60% res.<br />
The guy was overjoyed and saidd he would pay 100pp, I ignored that and proceeded to get details.<br />
It seems he was doing part of his epic (shaman) in Eruds crossing and had died in the zone. He had no idea where his corpse was though. hmmm<br />
So first off I told him that being a dark elf I didnt feel comfortable going into Queynos, but that I had a brother who is welcome in Queynos and he also has 60% res.<br />
So I go get my brother Savurass. When he finds the shaman i then proceed to look around for someone to summon the corpse. Luckly a guild friend was on that can summon, but the coffin was going to cost 180pp, shaman had no probs there and said to go ahead.<br />
Then as we were going to be 2 level 40 with a naked shaman in a zone that had killed a high level shaman (found out he was 52 by this time) I decided I would prefer some more support and called for help from a 52 druid friend.<br />
So off we go, we sit and wait for the boat and during that time had a good old chat with the shaman, he was froglok so he was even kind enough to help raise our froglok language skills while we were waiting.<br />
We get into Eruds Crossing and all goes very well and extremely easy, corpse is summoned, res, buff, heal and druid ports us back to PoK. All done.<br />
Then came the bit that made me smile. The Shaman gave the necro 300pp for helping out and offered me 200pp for the trouble. I didnt accept it but I was grateful for the offer and he was very thankful.<br />
It really made me happy to help out, if more people were kind like that Im sure all of us would be more willing to put ourselves out to help.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Fastest way to make 20 is to take that cleric to PC. you get a exp bonus and group bonus there. SO it has a double advantage if you wanna group  or if you wanna take a character up there to PL.....  I have a tiny little corner i love to park my PL characters in when I borrow my husbands shammy. run past B1 and go up the steep hill on the right..... dont go over the bridge but keep going right til you reach a spot thats a small corner near a tunnel. The spot should have one of them grime tunnelers parked there. Kill it and park your guardian angel (Shammy, Cleric, Druid, whatever) right there or on the small shelf by it.  Then have your baby character (preferably start at lvl 8 or 9) run and grab a creature.  Yea those ugly dudes have a disease dot but dont worry about curing it. Just keep your character healed and with buffs and you are fine. YOu can go to about 15 or 16 in that spot....... then all you do is have your guardian angel follow the pl character up the tunnel next to that spot as you kill your way up.....get lost up there if you wish but PC is the best place so far to PL a character. If you can fnd the tunnel with the blue fly lookin things then those can take you to lvl 20 or so.  OK ok smart person says go get a map......Smartass person (like myself) just gets lost in the tunnels and has fun taking out everything.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73"><font color="skyblue">As much as I love the XP bonus in PC, I loathe going in there any more.  Waaaay back when Luclin was still new and hardly anyone had heard of the place, Paludal was truly a great place to XP.  If you're not worried about coin to be made off of the bandits (both what they drop and the armor they drop), then maybe PC isn't so bad, since there are plenty of other mobs to kill.<br />
<br />
If you're in PC during any of the prime times and at a bandit camp, expect to have headaches.  People that in almost any other zone would respect the camp/spawns you have twist interpretations of the Play Nice Policy to whatever suits them.  The worszt ones have been, in my experience, the ones that are getting PLd.  They usually take an entire bandit camp, and rarely are willing to share with a group.  I've been in groups that had a camp to themselves then were unwilling to share it with a second group; I've told them that the camps can support two groups easily.  Maybe this has changed now that they can't get Aego/Virtue/KEI any more.<br />
<br />
Sol A would probably be a good alternative to the PC crowd.  BYOG and have at it killing gobbies.</font></td>

If only the very thought of Paludal didn't make me shudder. ;) <br />
<br />
Did 1-5 in E Commons, 5-8 in FoB (Monday night)<br />
<br />
Did 8-12 in Befallen, just because I hadn't been there since my original days in EQ before expansions...figured it would be empty and I was right. One enchanter there that left before I got a chance to ask him if he wanted to join. A guildie brought his level 10 Cleric in to join me, so I got 'em both a few levels in an hour or so.<br />
<br />
12-22 has been in the Warrens and I think I can suck one more level out of it before it becomes too tedious. Same XP bonus as Paludal, and always empty of XP farmers in the King's Chamber and Muglewump\diseased area. (A key factor for me, because I always hated seeing someone bring in their PL alt or high level farmer to suck up everything in the area when I was growing up)<br />
<br />
Guildie brought his Cleric for two of the nights, and I was alone for the last 2 levels.<br />
<br />
I think I scared my friend. I would run out with Duhikae, grab a train of a dozen or so and run back...usually picking up a few more on the way. He kept talking about 'Bad Pull' until he realized that neither of us ever died or even came close. The worst that would happen is that my Shammy would have to toss out a heal before we had firmly grabbed aggro on all of 'em, and we would lose a few to Old Yeller when they took a swing at the Shammy.<br />
<br />
Important Safety Tip: Your level 20 Cleric is *not* ready for Gunthak, even with HoS and all the other nifty 49 Shammy buffs. Especially if he is still equipped with his two CHA Steins instead of his normal Dark Ember and shield. Duhikae has now had his first death.<br />
He did slightly better once I re-equipped his weapons, and I could actually have done it but it would not have been cost effective...so I brought him back to the Warrens for a few levels.<br />
<br />
Now he is in level range with a bunch of Guild alts, so between guildies and pick up groups, I'm going to start using him solo.<br />
<br />
He's spent about 1.5 hours in PoK so far chain casting to get his spell skills up. I'm guessing there is at least 2 more hours of chain casting in his immediate future. He wasn't doing much spell slinging when he was being PL'd, so they kinda suck right now.<br />
I've got a hotkey set up with a Macro to chain cast a level 1 spell 4 times then Yaulp II. 35 seconds between clicks, so I can watch TV and just set my finger to 'auto-twitch'.<br />
<br />
So for anyone who wants\needs to PL someone and dreads Paludal: Go to the Warrens. If you want to make decent (for that level, at least) loot, the kobolds even drop bronze stuff fairly regularly.</td>
