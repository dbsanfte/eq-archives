<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">So, my Alliance held a BBQ in SkyFire on Friday. RageFire was the entertainment and the main course.<br />
<br />
We beat on the Scaly Piñata twice, and now I have my Epic along with another Cleric in my Alliance.<br />
<br />
Once turn ins were done, I headed for Dulak. Sadly, I never made it that night. Halfway there, I got a call to use my Clicky Stick for the very first time. Seems a group that had been at the BBQ went to Maiden’s Eye right afterwards and managed a wipe in short order.<br />
<br />
Shazzog deliberately drops Invis around Mobs…I swear it. He wasn’t the first recipient of my new mana free Rez, but he was number 3…<br />
<br />
I wandered aimlessly for a bit after that, looking for other people to rez. I was getting ready to log out, and decided to run my baby Ranger in to PoK to give Grillie the tailored quiver he had when I got a /tell from a level 9 wizard asking me if I wanted to group. Had to tell him ‘no’ of course, since I really did want to go to bed…<br />
<br />
Wizard_01 tells you, “How do I get a group? Where should I go? I’m new.”<br />
<br />
You tell Wizard_01, “Hmmm, maybe low end of Paludal? Or Field of Bone, then go to Kurn’s Tower. Warens would be good, but you won’t find a group there. Do you have access to PoK?”<br />
<br />
Wizard_01 tells you, “I have it, but I don’t know how to get there. I really new.”<br />
<br />
The player behind the toons whimpers silently, as he realizes that the night is about to get much, much longer…<br />
<br />
You tell Wizard_01, “Okay, give me just a minute, I’ll switch to my Main and show you the ropes.”<br />
<br />
A /who Wizard_01 all showed him in Freeport. Yep, about then, he tells me he died.<br />
<br />
Switched to Shazzog and Duhikae and went on down to Freeport, gonna have ourselves a time…<br />
<br />
I was talking him through how to find me about the time I noticed a large mass of guards running my way…seems some idiot thought it would be fun to kill the newbie guards, then realized he had no Clue and decided to demonstrate that to the world in general.<br />
<br />
Oh well, Shazzog really didn’t need that brand new KEI he got after his last death 30 minutes ago…<br />
I rezzed Shazzog and got the newbie wizard to my location…explaining some of the terms along the way. <br />
“I can’t meet you at the gates because Shazzog is KoS…that is Kill On Sight. Somewhat like what just happened when an idiot trained the guards on him at the PoK Book…”<br />
<br />
What should appear before me but a little Froggie wizard named Agrek. (Actually, I’m drawing a blank on his exact name, but it was something like Agrek, so I am going with that so I don’t keep having to call him Wizard_01)<br />
<br />
Grouped him up, buffed him up, and showed him how to get to the Book in West Freeport. <br />
<br />
Once in PoK, I gave him the $.50 tour…introduced him to SoulBinder Jerra and had him rebind, showed him the main Bank, the Nexus stone, etc.<br />
<br />
He was using backpacks and wrist pouches, so I gave him 20pp and had him swap them all out for <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6205">deluxe toolboxes</a>. He managed to accidentally delete his Newbie Chow, so I brought him to the merchants behind the Library, handed him another 20pp and had him buy a few stacks of Iron Rations and Water.<br />
<br />
Through out all of this, I pushed him in to information overload by telling him about Guilds, buying and selling with Vendors, basic zones to look in, how to use /LFG, etc. I knew there was no way he was going to absorb all of it, but if some of it stuck, great.<br />
<br />
We were about ready to head out…only a few more things I needed to show him. I brought him to the smaller bank on the Evil side, and showed him the Halfling banker. It’s a much better bank for smaller races, since they don’t have to fight through a crowd and try to peer over a counter.<br />
<br />
We were now ready to head over to the Field of Bone, but he still needed to know how to get home. Luckily, that portal is one down from the Cablis stone.<br />
<br />
I showed him the Grobb stone and explained how come it was A) on the Evil side and B) called Grobb instead of Gukta.<br />
<br />
“How does your Troll feel about that?”<br />
<br />
“Best not to talk to him about it.”<br />
<br />
Smartass.<br />
<br />
Away we went to the Field of Bone. I sent him off into the Pit with instructions to pull one at a time and make sure he stayed in casting range. I took the downtime to tell him the advantages and disadvantages to being PL’d (and what PL means). His spell skills were doing somewhat okay to that point, but they were about to take a serious hit since he would not be doing a whole lot of casting. I told him about chain casting to get his skills up later on, and not letting himself get PL’d too far without grouping and learning how to use his spells.<br />
<br />
The Pit was mostly blue to him so we moved into Kurn’s. Since we would be there a little while, I announced to the zone that they could send me a /tell if they got killed. I ws quite warmly received, needless to say.<br />
<br />
Agrek got a quick lesson in Kurn’s annoying agro rules when he brought two skellies back on his first pull, and they turned on the toon he ran them past.<br />
<br />
The poor beat upon bystander (who I had, by the way, fully buffed less than 15 minutes prior) shouted to the zone that Agrek had ‘trained’ him. Then zoned. Then came back and ran right up to Agrek and got agro again. Then zoned again. Then came back. Idiot.<br />
<br />
/ooc Since when are two low end skellies a train? Besides, he’s killing them now.<br />
<br />
Once he got the hang of it, we moved downstairs and pulled from the basement door. Before you knew it, he was level 12 and it was 3am.<br />
<br />
We gated back to PoK, and I showed him how to get to the Library and where to find his spell vendors. As usual, they didn’t have everything he needed, so I gave him another 20pp and sent him on his way back to Gukta with a fresh set of buffs.<br />
<br />
Saturday my Normal Band of Misfits tried camping Mr. Annoyed Soul Stealer. He popped once for us, but didn’t drop the Soul Stripper. Still, Beeff’s alt got a pretty nice back item out of it, so not a complete loss.<br />
<br />
Shortly after that, a Shaman who had helped me on several of my Epic raids asked for help in the Hole. He was originally going to try to do his turn in for his Epic.<br />
Once he did a bit more research and found out there were changes, he decided that we would just do an exploratory mission instead. We were shy of enough people to do the turn in safely even in the old Hole, he didn’t want to try it till he knew what it was like now.<br />
<br />
I like the Hole…we cleared our way down to almost the old turn in point with 7 people. It got hairy every once in a while, but never to a panic point. I’m guessing we will do the real thing next weekend, or possibly even this week. I also managed to ding 52 while I was in there.<br />
<br />
We called it off when KEI started dropping on everyone. It was just supposed to be an exploratory mission, and we had accomplished that, so we decide not to take unnecessary risks. Besides, a guildie of mine that had come along with us needed to kill a named Froggie in the Swamp of No Hope.<br />
<br />
I had left Shazzog sitting at the fountain at the Warrens entrance, so I collected him and set out for the Swamp. One of our new Shaman logged over to his 62 Warrior and came to tank. 15 minutes later, Thistle had his drop and I camped out for Pizza.<br />
<br />
When I cam eback, I got a fresh KEI and headed to the Armory in Dulak. Just before I was joined by an Ivory Order necro, I managed to kill <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11382">an Ore Refinery Overseer</a> and get something I had never seen before; a nice little <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20123">SK weapon</a><br />
<br />
Next respawn, the Overseer was back…and the Necro had one as well.<br />
<br />
Crasek, one of our newer SKs, came on about then, so I had him come down to join us. I handed over my new toy, and he promptly equipped it. That thing is HUGE in the hands of an Ogre! Also joining us was Massy, the shaman who had offered the services of his Warrior for our little foray in the Swamp earlier.<br />
<br />
I still hadn’t had a chance to rez anyone that day, so I asked Crasek to suck up a few deaths for me so I could work some of the stiffness out of my new Water Sprinkler. I figured I had given him the new lance, so he owed me, right?<br />
<br />
The ungrateful bastig thought I was <i>joking</i>!<br />
<br />
“Hey, I’m serious! No heals for j00!”<br />
<br />
I started pulling again, and in no time, his health was dropping nicely. Then he went to full health again.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Who’s healing him? I wanted him to die so I could rez him!”<br />
<br />
Shazzog looked at me funny, “You did, Du.”<br />
<br />
Ah damn, I had. Damn this Cleric Twitch Instinct!<br />
<br />
Everyone in the group got at least one diamond and a few other gems before we called it a night, and the necro got a Ding.<br />
<br />
Crasek steadfastly refused to die for me, though…so I never got to rez anyone on Saturday.<br />
<br />
I only got to play a few hours Sunday night, but I did managed to ding 54 on Shazzog, and go on one rescue mission into the Mines in Dulak. I solo’d the Armory, and picked up 2 Blue Diamonds, 2 sapphires and a few other gems. <br />
<br />
While I was getting my last 3% on Shazzog, Agrek came on and said ‘howdy’.<br />
He “was someplace called the Orc Highway”. Yeah, go go Old School zones!<br />
Shortly thereafter, his group moved to Paludal. As my last act for the night, I wandered up and buffed him and his group before I called it a night. My timing was excellent, as their tank had just died, so I was able to work the action on the Rez stick some more.<br />
<br />
All and all, a very eventful weekend for me.<br />
<br />
How was everyone else's weekend?</td>

Ah, the wonders of helping newbies. You never know if you helped the mighty Wizard, who will one day save your life, or just the next fool who pulls a train and destroys you :)  Endless possibilities in endless worlds!</td>

Yep, hence why I try to start training 'em in proper fashion as soon as I catch 'em. Strengthens possibility 1 and decreases odds on 2</td>
