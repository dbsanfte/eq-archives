Okay, here's some background. Im a 37 Dorf Cleric of Brell and i have been doing some hunting in the Overthere.<br />
<br />
I'm hunting in a group that I've been with for a few hours and I am about to Ding level 37 when I /gsay BATTLE CLERIC!!! and run up to melee a mob that is almost dead. While im off smashing the Sarnak to death, our Druid starts making a string of profane comments about what he already told me. Then it dawned on me that our Druid had asked me the previous day to not use the term Battle Cleric because of some horrible experience he had had in the past. I quickly appologize so that everyone in the group stays happy.<br />
<br />
Maybe 15 minutes later, when I see a Kunark Rhino is on its death march, I run to the fron lines with my Hammer in my hand and I restrain myself from /gsay Battle Cleric! because of the Druid. So instead i say /g i AM a Paladin! bwarharharhar! Our Paladin starts making fun of me as the Rhino takes its last breath and our Monk states that I'm actually more of a Battle Cleric.<br />
<br />
Of course this sets of the Druid in one of his characteristic rages. He starts swearing and yelling and making comments about the Monk's mother and what have you. The Monk starts making fun of the Druid in a not so friendly manner and the situation escelates into a full blown battle very quickly.<br />
<br />
So, being the Cleric that I am, I decided that I should try and calm the two parties down so that the group can resume hunting. My initial attempts at 'Hey guys, settle down!' or 'Common, just ignore him' fail miserably and the bickering starts to really get on my nerves. Pretty soon, I remember discussions we have had about leaving groups that are bad for you, so the idea came into my head to threaten to leave the group if the fighting doesnt stop. So I give them to the count of three to stop the fighting, or else I'll leave!<br />
<br />
1....<br />
2....<br />
3.... adios guys<br />
<Disband><br />
At this point I dont know what is being said in the /g but i do see the Druid walk off and the Monk walk the other direction, posting their LFG. About a minute later, I get a tell from the Monk about how immature I am for abandoning a group like that, and how childish I was for leaving over a stupid argument.<br />
<br />
Wow, some people really get my goat.<br />
<br />
/rantoff<br />
<br />
So here are my questions:<br />
Was it a good idea to leave a group that I'm not enjoying because of two idiots like that?<br />
Should I have expected the two arguing parties to stop at my command?<br />
What would you have done?</td>

1) yeah, for sure. You should feel free to leave any group if you are not happy or comfortable. I would have.<br />
2) No, you should not have, why would they?<br />
3) I would have told the Druid he is an idiot and that Ill say what I like when running into battle. If It were my group and he continued I would have disbanded him, if not my group I would leave. There is nothing wrong with yelling Battle Cleric and if the druid took offence to that he needs to loosen up a bit.</td>

1) It's a GAME  if your not having fun don't play. In this case with the druid and later  the monk.  It wont take long for another group invite, so if your not having fun find another group to have fun in :D <br />
<br />
2) Only if they are RL friends or they like the way you keep them alive and want to continue to hunt with you.<br />
<br />
3) Told the druid I was in roleplay and when I go into battle I yell "BATTLECLERIC" and tell the monk to pull /smilewink <br />
<br />
Start your own group, that way your always the leader  ;) <br />

I have sat here for about 10 minutes reading over other posts and I "Still" can't figure out a single reason why someone wouldn't like "Battle-Cleric" said during an attack. Poor Druid had a horrible experience in the past? Poor Muffin.. He seems to be spreading those "Horrible" experiences wherever he goes.. <br />
<br />
Were you right in disbanding? IMHO you were. You never mentioned who was the group leader, but I probably would have sent /tells to the other group members who where not being asses and sudgested reforming the group minus the "emotional baggage". I'll bet you and that Paly could have done very well together as you never mentoned him joining in the bickering and a Paly-Cleric combo can Rock in the Overthere.<br />
<br />
As for the Monk's /tell about how Immature you were for leaving.. well file that one along with the Druid. Its a game that You PAY to play.. you PAY to enjoy yourself, you don't Pay to listen to children squabble and exchange foul language./disband and /ignore are very usefull tools to weed out Nobs, NooBs and Snerts.<br />
<br />
Been looking for ya online Battering.. My "Lackey". Muhahahaa.. . I have an Alt group that is rapidly approaching your level and we could use a Cleric. Right now we have a Ranger, a Druid and an Enchanter.. but it will take a bit more time to catch up to ya.. I'll keep searching for ya online and send ya a /tell when I see you. Until then, don't give up the fight!</td>

I think I'd be more inclined to show them that it <i>can</i> be done...and that it can be a benefit.<br />
<br />
The people I generally group with know and now <i>expect</i> that I am going to be a Battle Cleric as much as possible.<br />
I've had a few announce that, as far as they were concerned, I could pull and tank any time I wanted.<br />
<br />
Granted, this works as well as it does because any group I am in also has Shazzog off to the side making sure the mob is slowed, sending in Old Yeller, and standing by as a backup healer in case I run into trouble. Without a slower and buffer, I'd have to do a lot more healing, and probably <i>would</i> have to sit on my can a lot more.<br />
<br />
That's the key, though...they know that I am going face to face with the mob because I know I can still heal them up, or I wouldn't be doing it. (Same goes for me rezzing or buffing the random player who needs help. I've never had anyone complain or get worried. They know it means I am sitting down the next few fights, but they will still be fine...they just won't have my 'uber dps' added, and someone else will have to get off their butts and pull if they don't want to wait)<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the problems only occur in pick up groups, since they may not have learned to trust your skills. One more reason I avoid complete pick up groups. I'll add Random_Player_01 and maybe _02 to my known group, but the core of the group is going to be people who are used to me and know they will stay alive as long as no one gets stupid.<br />
<br />
Still, I would think that after enough pick up groups, you'd have fought alongside enough people that your Legend would spread. Too bad we can't carry Letters of Recomendation from previous group members.<br />

"To Whom It May Concern: This Cleric is a fully qualified Battle Cleric who knows when to sit and med and knows when it is safe to beat on the mob. Shut up and enjoy the extra DPS."</td>

After about 20 min of this dr00d going on and on about how horrible everything in EQ was, and me haveing asked him in /tell and in /group to stop please, he would not. Finally, I had taken as much of it as I could stand, so I say, in /group So who's leaving, me or the Druid?.. 4 seconds later, druid was disbanded.. not necessarily the most diplomatic means of shutting him up, but it got him to stop..in group..

I think that a cleric has a spot in melee under certain situations.  Obviously, if the mob is at 30% or lower, I dont see how the cleric could steal the aggro from the MA at this point.  There are a lot of factors though.  Do you need to train in 1H or 2H Blunt?  Did you heal the MA (if needed) before you started melee?  Did you ask first before going into melee?  Some people are just uncomfortable with it, and after an incident, I do realize it.  <br />
<br />
I was grouping with a 59 Druid, 65 Monk, and a 65 Necromancer in Great Divide, killing the wurms in the tunnels, when I decided "Hey, I'm level 50, I have some great tanks with me here, why dont I just jump in and melee?"  Well, somehow the necromancer ended up getting aggro'd, I'm still not entirely sure how that happened, perhaps I aggro'd some mobs over to us and they ended up hitting the necro somehow?  However, the next thing I know, I looked up, there were 3 wurms, all 3 of us were basically tanking our own mobs, and everyone slowly but surely losing hit points, and I am unable to heal becuase the wurms are knocking the crap outta me, so we had no choice except to succor out.  Luckily the druid was not in combat, and was able to do that.  Needless to say, the necromancer was a bit disappointed that I entered melee, and asked me to stay out of it.  Heh<br />
<br />
After that incident, I was pretty shy about doing melee, but once I reached mid 50's, when you finally get the Hammer of Judgement spell, you get a weapon that actually does some good damage, and when combined with Yaulp V, you can attack pretty fast.  So, I decided since my 1H blunt and Offense were basically at newbie levels (only around 60 each), I made sure to ask the group before I entered melee, and the MA was fine with it.  So, I have come to the conclusion that if you see that your group can handle the mobs, make sure it's ok with the rest of the group if you "practice your 1H blunt, and offense", and generally that's an accepted reason for a cleric to melee.  I was doing melee and pulling very little aggro in IC camp at Plane of Valor on the razorfiends.  Cast unswerving hammer, sit back and heal until the mob gets down to 50% or lower, then jump in and melee some, making sure to do a CH or a HoT onto the MA before you begin, that way you can ensure the safety of the group, and everyone gets what they want.  DPS, practiced skills, healed MA, dead mob :)<br />
<br />
I still dont think that clerics are very well at melee, unless they've trained their skills high enough.  (NOTE: be sure to melee as much as you can at earlier levels, because finding a group that will allow you to melee is less common at higher levels.  Either the mobs hit too damn hard, and your mana and meditation is more necessary, or, the simple fact that clerics aren't the best soloers, so, just be careful, and considerate of the group)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Some times people argue over stupid things...just a fact of life.  If the group can't overcome it then I would leave as well.  As a cleric you can usually get a group when you want to anyways.  You hold the power most of the time, unless the zone is flooded with clerics.  I will put up with probably more crap in a group than most but you have to know when to say "when".  Some times the animosity in a group can lead to some poor judgement.  I have seen people do things to purposedly get others hurt because they did not like something about them.  I don't like it and I am sure none of you do.  We play this game to have fun and release some stress, not create it.  It is not worth it.  When some one goes ballistic in the group for something sometimes it is better to find another group, play an alt, or just log off for a while.</td>
