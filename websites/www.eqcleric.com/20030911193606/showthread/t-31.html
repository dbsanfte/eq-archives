<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Rich Waters posted a more detailed response last night to the recent changes done to Clerics on test:<br />
<br />
<table border="0" align="center" width="90%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1"><tr><td><i>Lately, we've been working up some changes to help balance out the cleric class. This is important to get done before Planes of Power, as it's the foundation for the growing role of priest classes in the future of EverQuest. The goals behind these changes are to:<br />
<br />
<li>Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing <br />
<li>Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain <br />
<li>Increase the level of variety and interest involved in playing a cleric <br />
<br />
The first part of the change was to add the following spells:<br />
<br />
<li>Hammer of Judgement - CLR/56 (summon a hammer with a powerful and frequent proc effect) <br />
<li>Yaulp V - CLR/56 (self only melee and mana regen buff. Adds haste, dexterity, mana regen, and stamina regen) <br />
<br />
These spells are useful in allowing the cleric to do a new form of combat damage. Clerics use the new Yaulp spell to gain melee haste, standing mana regeneration, and increased Dexterity. This helps out a great deal by allowing the cleric to use their new summoned hammer at peak efficiency. <br />
<br />
The summoned hammer is a unique weapon in that it has a very high proc frequency, doing 75-150 damage per proc. This allows clerics to do reasonable melee style damage by relying on the procs alone. The cleric's pet "Unswerving Hammer of Faith" has had it's mana cost and casting time lowered, as well as it's effectiveness upgraded. The hammer pet cannot be riposted or effected by spells, though it is rapidly killed if no one is tanking for it. The hammer pet still poofs after each combat, but for the new price of 250 mana, it adds an amount of damage that's very competitive with other damage-over-time spells. <br />
<br />
Using Yaulp + the Hammer of Judgement, the cleric begins to be effective in toe-to-toe combat. Other supporting spells available to the cleric are his low cost summoned pet, and the Mark of Retribution/Mark of Karn spells. Using a combination of these spells, along with the clerics excellent buffs give surprisingly good results. In testing, clerics have been effective soloing the entrance to Charasis and Chardok, grouping in a number of high end dungeons, and even making reasonable experience as a two-cleric duo in Cazic-Thule. <br />
<br />
This upgrade allows clerics a new style of relatively effective soloing, as well as some excellent options to add value in groups. While this may not be sufficient to get clerics into groups by itself, it does add significant value and allows even multi-cleric groups to be profitable. Fairly extensive play-testing, both by game designers and clerics on test have proven these spells to be effective, and perhaps more importantly, very entertaining to use. <br />
<br />
In addition to the added spells, we'll be trying out the Bash skill for Clerics, beginning at level 25. While this skill will cap out lower than their melee counterparts, clerics should still get a decent amount of value out of this addition. It adds a bit of damage as well as a free chance to stun opponents. This also works well with the recent improvements to shields on Test, that give a meaningful boost to armor class, in addition to a chance to block incoming blows. <br />
<br />
The following heal spells were added to the cleric class:<br />
<br />
<li>Ethereal Elixir - CLR/60 (group version of the Celestial Elixir heal-over-time spell) <br />
<li>Ethereal Light - CLR/58 (upgraded version of Divine Light single target heal) <br />
<li>Ethereal Remedy - CLR/59 (upgraded version of Remedy single target heal) <br />
<br />
These spells are not expected to add a great deal of power to clerics, as clerical healing is already more than sufficient. These spells are all minor but useful upgrades to existing clerical heals. The goal with these spells is to round out a cleric's healing versatility and allow them to tailor their memmed healing line-up to whatever adventuring situation they find themselves in. With this large selection of healing spells, clerics are able to fit various situations more efficiently than any other class. <br />
<br />
It's important that clerics maintain their role as the premier healer of the game. Raid quality heals are being added for other priests to allow them to fulfill their role as secondary healers in most situations. Clerics have always been a healing specialist, but the situation has escalated such that many raid level encounters may not be undertaken without disproportionally large numbers of clerics. No other class has been able to fill in if a cleric is absent, and healing is too important of a role to allow one class to dominate it so completely. After these changes are complete, clerics will still be the very best of healers but other priests class are able to substitute to some degree. <br />
<br />
Clerics are going to receive additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping. The final ability choices will be made after this first set of changes is evaluated and tested more extensively. It's very important that clerics have an ability that makes other players say "I really want to invite a cleric because they can do X, and that will be really helpful." This is vital to the health of the class. All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true. <br />
<br />
We understand that there's a lot of trepidation at major changes, and fears that your class will become less valuable in the game. When the changes are finished, I think most people will be pleased and will feel that their concerns have been listened to and addressed. The health of all classes in the game is as important to the dev team as it is to the many people who've spoken up passionately about their concerns here on this board. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience, <br />

I play a 34th lvl cleric and fail to see how these (granted the changes are not finished yet) changes will help enhance either of the above.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I whole heartedly agree...<br />
<br />
My main concern with these changes is that a cleric will not be as desired in the grouping experience now that druids and shammies can perform these functions to a greater extent.<br />
<br />
Now let it be said that they will not replace the cleric's superior healing capability at all, however it might diminish the need for a cleric where one was needed before.<br />
<br />
The big question will be whether these changes gives the cleric more of a realistic soloing capability compared to the loss in group desireability. It remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
This is another step in VI's quest to extend the upper section of the game. It's hard to say what will really come of it until we get to experience it first hand.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">To answer your question, I believe should these changes go live, you will find many clerics able to solo.  In other words decrease the mandatory dependency for groups for reasonable gain.<br />
<br />
How it works? <br />
<br />
after fully buffed, Stun pull a mob (new hammer in hand). Cast Mark of Karn and Mark of Retribution (this heals you when you hit them and damages them when they hit you) on the stunned mob, by that time stun is broken.. Start Melee.<br />
Yaulp V every 20 seconds or so and stun.  Casting in the Unswerving hammer adds even more melee damage. When you life is gettin  lower. Stun, tab-heal, tab fight again.. Should be highly effective.<br />
<br />
If they are doin the entrance to charasis .. that screams the potency. <br />
<br />
And, given that this works, wouldn't you agree that this adds some versatility to the class that isn't there atm? And doesn't being able to do things that you cannot do currently add some elements of enjoyment and interest in playing a cleric?<br />
<br />
Granted I am high enough to take advantage of these immediatly should they go live. The tendency is to add these things at high level, and retro fit them into the class down the road( the latter being much more difficult to keep balanced I would think.) Lower level versions of the mark line, adding stats and procs to the other summoned hammer spells, just a few examples of what they may do.  At level 25, you had to begin to see that your role changed alot, you were no longer as able to stand in the fray. By 34 certainly you are Med/heal/buff repeating eh? Wouldn't you find it more interesting to add more to the group. Not saying that keeping everyone alive isn't enough.<br />
<br />
I find these possibilities enthralling.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I am not sure what is meant by "Raid quality healing".  If this means that the CLR class lose their eminence in healing by having competitive CHeal'ers in other Priest classes - this is a very bad thing.<br />
<br />
It is bad enough that we have lost the monopoly on Rez'ing.  The last straw will be losing the only factor that makes all the pain of building a CLR through the low levels finally worth it!<br />
<br />
I doubt if changes to a summoned hammer or pet spell will every make the CLR more than marginal at melee.<br />

I for one do not wish to be "balanced" into oblivion by losing that which makes us unique, as a class.  Especially where the "reward" is the ability to be substandard melee.<br />
<br />
If the issue is there is a shortage of CLR on raids - the answer is not to gut the class by making the core skill accessible by all priest classes</td>

<br />
We have held complete sway over healing for so long.. it is a difficult thing to just see goining away to other classes.  Yet, I don't see a 3k hp heal replaceing a Cleric cheal that is holding a tank up.  Tanks on high end raids as you know are getting 5.5k-7k hit points..  No heal but Complete heal will suffice.  Certainly this will be a benifit to dru/shamans in spot healing tanks... and morso holding up all the other members of the raid(those with more average hit points).  <br />
<br />
As for our supposed new melee abilities.  News from the test server states that clerics are able to provide decent melee/spell damage. Number they were using ranged from 30 dps (damage per second) to 43 dps.  To compare Paladins can do about 34 dps.  The hammer procs an 80 -150 dd every 2-3 swings.. with MoR doin 15 damage evertime the mob hits and the animated hammer double attacking for 40-60 you can see how it adds up quickly. That in addition to the new things added for shields and particularly the bash skill.. (Instead of hitting for 1 damage its hitting for 20-40 and someone stated AA abilities having it crit in the 100 range). This stuff is exciting. Plus it plays on our past.. Most of us still want to get in there and mix it up a bit from time to time. And now we can be effective. <br />
<br />
Do these changes redifine clerics on raids? <br />
<br />
This I cannot see.. <br />
<br />
Do the changes redifine us in groups?<br />
<br />
Most certainly.<br />
My hope is that its all for the better.. Let the druids Cheal for a change.. I wanna bash something. :p<br />

<br />
What do Clerics get out of this - nothing that they shouldn't have already.<br />
<br />
I haven't summoned a hammer since newbie levels.  The hammer line of spells is a complete waste of time by modern Norrath standards.  It is about time the line was upgraded to something remotely relevant - independent of any class balancing issues.<br />
<br />
Who wastes a spell slot on any Yalup line?  Again, by modern Norrath standards - noone in their right mind.<br />
<br />
These are the rewards for losing our last and greatest point of singularity?!?<br />
<br />
<roleplay=ON><br />
<br />
Fie!  The gods of Norrath so despise their most ardent and faithful worshipers that they wish to bestow their greatest gift on the less devoted.<br />
<br />
<roleplay=OFF><br />
<br />
To end on a positive note - the Cleric defensive ability could be boosted as some partial compensation.<br />
<br />
If the 10% healing penalty for DRU and SHA is coming off - CLR should be compensated with the ablity to Dodge and Parry to high skill levels.<br />
<br />
I repeat - the proposed changes to the hammer and yalup line should not be considered class balancing issues - the changes need to be done because of ability inflation.  I remember the days when ancient heros faced Dragons clad with some bronze!  These days every Warrior has super-uber weapon/armour expectations to go Orc hunting.  The available lewt has kept up with these increasing expectations - the spell lines have not!<br />
<br />
I also remember the early days of my first Cleric - where the notion of the "Battle Cleric" was put forth.  The Clerical community rejected this for what it is - a complete sham.  Who specialises in anything other than Abjuration?  Where are the Evocation specialists?  To think that the "Battle Cleric" can be forged from melee skills (instead of spell casting offense, of old) is an equal absurdity.<br />
I get the feeling that the Priest class balancing is being done by Druids and Shaman :(<br />
<br />
The warning is that the Clerical class is being further marginalised.<br />
<br />
My message to my Clerical comrades: DO NOT ACCEPT THE DILUTION OF THE CORE COMPETANCE OF OUR CLASS!!  We are being offered trinkets as a salve to a gross injustice - the betrayal of our devotion to our Gods.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have to agree with Monaco. The changes would be exciting if they weren't accompanied by the changes made in the other classes. <br />
   I've already lived thru a point where groups prefered a druid with their ability to ds, and snare. I don't want to go back to being unwanted because druids can heal 'good enough' and have other abilities we don't. I don't want to be able to solo! I want to be wanted and needed in a group!! That is why I chose a cleric, that is why I perservered through levels 15 to 30 when I could not find a group most days and could not solo. I like logging on and knowing that I will be the difference between an ok group and a truely successful one! I have paid my dues and do NOT want to be pushed off into the margins again.<br />
   And where does VI get off "balancing" the class only for the upper end? How long does it take to get around to helping out lower level characters. Due to my RL situation I level VERY slowly. When will I even get to take 'advantage' of this new 'balancing'?<br />
   I've had a very long hard 3years(RL years!) getting my cleric to level 47. With nearly 10 more to go before the 'balancing act' effects me.... I don't like it. It stinks! No thank you, keep your proc'ing hammer! :P~~<br />
<br />
ok, rant off... I'm really a very sweet person in game and in rl... I just have a little bit of an opinion on this particular subject. :)</td>

Just a bit of a question.   When are the shaman/druids getting the Cheal?   at what level?  Or the 3k heal or whatnot?  This will make a difference.  I dont know, I aint a cleric, shaman, or druid to any degree.  From my viewpoint, the changes should be positive overall.  I mean, true it might cut down on some of your grouping potential in the high end game, but from what Ive noticed,  clerics generally are a 1 per group class, this proposes to change that.  In high end zones, if all the groups have a cleric, you are SOL.  now you can actually go solo, rather than run around beggin for a group.  On raids, clerics will always be wanted.  With these changes, it looks like, it wont be so redundant to have more than one cleric in a pickup group.  But, time will tell, I suppose.<br />

Don't you find your own self holding back that nuke so that the group can go ahead and pull again right away, or so as not to waste the mana you might need to heal? <br />
<br />
If a druid is going to be a main group healer... they won't be able to provide all the benifits to the group that they have at thier disposal..all at once. <br />
<br />
Eigther they buff/heal.... or Snare, crowd control/heal... or DoT/heal.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, their low ac.. heals of this size are goin to get them killed.. and alot. They cannot take hits as well.. can't run away like usual( gotta keep the group alive).. can't DA to save themselves.  <br />
<br />
The beatings we take for healing seem normal to us.. try havin only 800 ac and a serious lack of hp (can't buff themselves up like we can) its goin to be deadly.  <br />
<br />
Still backup healers folks.. <br />
<br />
Shamans on the other hand.. they're goin to rock.. hehe but  a lucky few shamans already have torpor and its more mana efficient than their new "CHeal".<br />
<br />
Fact is:<br />
<br />
To call these spells "Slightly toned down versions of Complete Heal." was the wrong way to address this.<br />
<br />
Would the general uproar in the cleric community have reached these levels if the announcement had been:<br />

<br />
So what will be the effects of the Priest class balancing - the absolute difference a CLR makes to a group will decline - this will mean less demand for CLR and a tougher time for CLR at all levels.<br />
<br />
Even worse - the new "Battle Clerics" will most likely be Dwarves.  They have STR and DEX advantages over the other common Clerical race - High Elves.<br />
<br />
The proposed changes take too much away from the Clerical class and also change the race "balance" within the Clerical class.<br />
<br />
If we are going to end up being "second tier" Paladins - I'd rather see significant improvements in the defensive capability of the CLR class.  This would make more sense from a "story line" perspective.  CLR can't draw blood - but can excel at defending themselves.<br />
<br />
This would give some scope to the "Battle Cleric" - tough to kill - and the traditional "Caster" cleric.<br />
<br />
Final point - do the proposed changes also apply to NPC Clerics?  With the increase in offensive capability, taking on that Spectral Curate in KC will involve a whole new world of pain.  What about NPC DRU and SHA - they will be alot tougher to kill.<br />
<br />
I remained silent when we lost the monopoly on Res'ing.  However, these proposed changes are the last straw - we either defend the integrity of our class or pass into oblivion.<br />
<br />
Remember - once enacted - the healing improvements given to DRU and SHA will never be withdrawn.  What is the way forward to "rebalance" the CLR class when nobody wants to play a CLR anymore?<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have been bitching and moaning about Clerics since I hit 30th level back in the 1st couple months of EQ.  I complained nonstop that clerics only had 1 skill (Dodge) and it capped out at a measly 80.  We had shields but couldnt bash.  Our maces were slow and did no dmg. We had zero weapons that proc'd.  My remedies for these problems in the early days?   Allow clerics to have bash.  If they werent going to give us decent melee weapons and cap our 1hb/2hb skills so low, we should atleast get double attack!   Divine Aura but we could get stunnned?   The list goes on... If you look at the 1st two years of EQ, I can count how many positive adjustments they've made to clerics on 1 hand. ( I am dead serious.)<br />
  <br />
<br />
I for one craved to be a batte priest.  A Dark elven priest of hate... yet I was religated to med boy.  It was terrible.  When chanters were nuking undead with DD spells that did more to undead than my undead nukes I was ranting and raving again. I always believed that we should have an ICE COMET comparible spell vs undead creatures.  When I found out we had a pet I was stoked, then I learned that it was killed in 1 hit and took up way to much mana... And again I was disappointed in clerics.  I stopped playing EQ when my cleric reached 56th level.  After a lengthy break I came back and made a warrior who is now 50th level.   Upon hearing the proposed changes to clerics, I am chomping at the bit to get back on and kick some butt with my cleric :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am absolutely stoked about these changes.  Granted we still need some work... like making the Strength line of spells actually work like Shamans... (Gods grant spells that are absolutely useless and actually turn into curses?)<br />
<br />
We should have see invisiblity (Divine Sight), Invisiblity , and levitate style spells. We should have water breathing and a horde of other spells. Anything other than heal, buff, stun would be a great addition.  From what I am seeing they are working on the cleric and this is all I ask!!!  <br />

<br />
Correcting this is not a "Class Balancing " issue.  These changes should happen  because of "ability inflation" and Clerics have NOT kept up!<br />
<br />
It seems clear to everyone that the proposed DRU/SHA heals will reduce demand for CLR at the top end of the game.  And remember this extends to all levels when the 10% healing bonus CLR have comes off (relative to DRU and SHA).<br />
<br />
We have part of the Clerical community that want to be "Battle Clerics".  To be fair - this was a notion introduced at the start of the game and never adequately supported.<br />
<br />
These are three separate issues.<br />
<br />
The CLR spell set needs revision because there is so much useless, lightweight crud that needs to be scaped off.  This would also be a good opportunity to deliver on the design intention to create the "Battle Cleric" - by improving melee capability.  I also think that adding first tier defence would be a useful proposal.<br />
<br />
As far as "Class Balancing" is concerned - CLR are big time losers given current proposals.  The CHeal-lite offered to DRU and SHA is not a "re-balancing" - it is a complete "re-design".<br />
 <br />
Why not let CLR cast Clarity, Ice Comet and have Double attack?  This makes as much sense as passing an uber heal to DRU and SHA.  Why can't we DoT and DS to uber levels - because we are NOT DRU.  Why can't we uber buff and make potions - because we are NOT SHA.<br />
<br />
The proposed changes will make CLR the weakest of the Priest classes.  <br />
