<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My group camped Enraged three times this weekend…got the SoulStripper all three times. (woot!)<br />
<br />
The first time, it was Shazzog and I, Beeff the Warrior, Grillie the Warrior and Widda the Druid.<br />
SoulStripper drops, we all roll on it. Beeff didn’t know it was only usable by priest class at the time (Cleric, Druid, Shaman). He said afterwards that, had he known, he wouldn’t have rolled.<br />
<br />
Grillie won the roll, and said he was giving it to his druid, Letta. Beeff had a problem with that, because he felt it should only have gone to one of the chars present that could use it. This, of course, is in line with common thinking of NBG, Mains first, Chars that are present getting first dibs, etc. (Though Widda isn’t the main for that player, that toon gets equal time along side the Pally main, so we would have counted Widda as a main)<br />
<br />
Again, I see where Beef was coming from. By normal loot rules (for our guild, at least) Grillie shouldn’t have rolled.<br />
<br />
I, personally, didn’t have a problem with it. Neither did Widda, aside from it meaning he still didn’t have one.<br />
<br />
My feelings in this instance were that Grillie had been there to help the whole time, and had a char that needed it, so no problem. If it were a mob that was hard to camp, or required a raid force, it would have been different. In the case of the Enraged, it just takes a decent group and some patience. (as evidenced by the fact that we got it every time we camped for it this weekend)<br />
<br />
The next day, it was Shazzog, me, Beeff and Letta camping the Soul Stripper. When it dropped, there was no question of who got it…it defaulted to me. Letta had hers, and Beeff wasn’t about to roll on it while I was still without one. No problems there, everyone was happy.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, we were bored silly in the SW corner, and Beeff requested (to me, in a /tell) we camp the Enraged again, because he needed money badly, and I had told him how much they sold for. I had no problem with that. We had no other Priest class present that didn’t have one, so if it dropped, it was definitely a Greed roll. We had one other Warrior, but he was afk fairly regularly, and wouldn’t really care about it anyway. (If he did, I would have offered to camp it again for him, of course)<br />
<br />
I went for a reKEI, Letta switched back to Grillie, and down we went. Along the way, we picked up an Alliance necro. We camped it for an hour or so, and were just about to have to leave for the Kael raid (which I didn’t make it to, but that’s another story), Enraged popped. <br />
<br />
I stated, “Okay, Beeff and Lecorpse roll. Grillie and I got ours this weekend, so we stay out. Muddle, do you want to roll as well?” (I knew Muddle was still afk, and even if he wasn’t, he would pass since he didn’t help kill it)<br />
<br />
Beeff agreed, both in tell and in Group Chat. The Necro didn’t really seem to care (I think she was just there to group with Alliance types who would get along and not act like idiots), but agreed to roll as well. Neither wanted to roll first, so I said, “Okay, I’ll roll first, but mine doesn’t count.”<br />
<br />
Heh, rolled a 96.<br />
<br />
Beeff, thankfully, rolled higher than the Necro. (I say thankfully because he <i>was</i> the reason we were camping it, but I couldn’t very well exclude Lecorpse).<br />
<br />
Grillie asked what alt Beeff was giving it to. I said, “The Bazaar Alt, more than likely”.<br />
Beeff confirmed it and said, “Yes, I wouldn’t take it if we had a char that could use it, but since we all have them that need them, I’m selling it.”<br />
<br />
I got the feeling, though he didn’t say anything, that Grillie felt he should have been able to roll as well.<br />
<br />
My feeling on it was that since we had both got ours with Beeff’s help, it was only fair that he get one as well (and Widda\Galihad if he camps it with us again) before we are eligible for a second one.<br />
<br />
Once the ‘normal gang of misfits’ have all received one, future drops can and will be an ‘all roll’ to set loot order again. On round two, it starts again…if you have received one, you aren’t eligible until everyone else who is helping camp it gets one. <br />
<br />
The only hard part will be how to handle people who only show up once or twice. I’ll have to deal with that on a case by case basis. If they really need the item, we will obviously default it to them. If it is a Greed item, then I think everyone should be able to roll, even if they just got another one. This lets the occasional groupie have a shot, but lets the regulars still have a reason to allow random people to join.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this sound fair to everyone? Would you have handled it differently?<br />
I seem to have become the default Leader of our happy little band, so I want to make sure how I am handling things is fair to all involved.</td>

I run all my raids/groups that way. NBG to the Chars playing first, then after that those who have not got a drop roll on items.<br />
If you get a nice item, then AFAIC you are out of all drops and rolls until the whole group has won an item..UNLESS...the whole group decide you should get it.</td>

Tell people who join late what is going on and what they can expect ... it's only fair and that is what you would want. ALSO ...

And now on my favorite subject ... WHat is up with Master Looters (ML's) now-a-days ? Do they really think that the whole group is there for them to abscond with the parties whole take for the afternoon ? Do they really think that we don't know how much a darkwood bow or a shimmering clover are worth as VT (Vendor Trash) ? Why is it that when the ML has to leave he never comes back with a share of plat for everyone ? Is the newest breed of ML just kids who have to run to the dinner tableand as such the reason "Mom's calling me for dinner" or "Dad wants to use the computer" allows them to keep 3 or 4 hundred plat to themselves. No wonder these guys have such UBER gear and I am so damned poor.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Most of the pickup groups I'm in are run fairly. Everyone gets a fair share of the loot with the cleric getting a raw, blue or regular diamond to pay for peridots. I did have an occurence in PoJ where an enchanter named Qlain took off with 3-400 plat worth of items because "his mom wanted him off the computer."He declared himself ML from the start and said he'd split at the end. I knew right away what it would amount to, he'd end up with a good chunk of cash and the other 5 ppl would get screwed. I go LD and come back, group except him are still there and they told me he had to go. I asked if he had split the loots, 2-3 ppl said Nope and had another similar occurence in PoV where a ranger thought it'd be funny to watch ppl fly for loots as he ninja'd them before the mob hit the ground. Though with the guild I'm applying to, nothing on raids gets looted unless you have the authority to do so. Gives no room for BS or miscommunication.</td>

Yep, thats the way we are on raids as well, but apparently that is a bit bugged.<br />
<br />
In Chardok last Saturday, one of my group members was able to loot a few items. I don't <i>think</i> the timer had run out, but it might have.<br />
<br />
In any event, it wasn't a problem, as he was also a guild member of mine. I just had him turn the stuff over to me before the raid ended, and we added it into the pool.<br />
<br />
We generally don't do open raids, so we rarely have that issue, even if someone does manage to loot out of turn.</td>
