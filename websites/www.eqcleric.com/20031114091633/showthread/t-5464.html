<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello All!! We finally made it back to the states and are now on the east coast (vs. Italy)!! After a long arduous journey and battles with the U-Haul from hell we reached our destination but not without a grave casualty...........<br />
<br />
/me sobs at the thought of the loss of a valued friend..........<br />
<br />
-----It all began when we decided to ship the PC's to ourselves from Italy to my folks house stateside so that the movers would not demolish them (as has happened in the past).  I made my merry way to the Post Office and mailed out "our babies", insured of course, and went on to assure the packing out of our house went according to schedule not bothering to worry about the computers because well they were with the US Post Office.  Our flight left on time and arrived in the states about 12 hours later, me Wardyn, our daughter and the two fuzzy rats (also known as the cats). We grabbed our luggage and the cats and then all piled into dad's van for the five hour trip to his house. Upon getting out of the van I am assaulted by 60 lbs of blonde fur flying towards me from the Direction of dad's front door! His dog realized I was home and decided she wanted to greet me first. <br />
<br />
/me rolls her eyes at the big mutt and grins<br />
<br />
All went well after I picked myself up off the ground and dusted off my sore and mistreated butt (12 hours on a plane and then 5 in a van will kinda do that ya know) then went updstairs to bed. I came down the next morning to my kid brother awaiting my arrival to deliver the bad news..........the post man dropped one of the PC towers off the back of the truck!! You can imagine my reaction to that news!! Sure enough Wardyn's PC was totally demolished we are talking case crushed fan rattling about and all the drives bent. He cried. Fortunately I had ghosted my system with all his info on it for his EQ account or the post man would have been hunted dwon and beaten to death.  I went and filed the claim at the post office to get him the cash for a new one (and wouldn't ya know it  is gonna take at least 4-6 weeks to hear about it).<br />
<br />
-----We thought all our bad luck had run it's course with the computer but little did we know what awaited us around the corner.  We spent two days locating a 10ft u-haul to collect his mother's things so she could come and stay with us (this is good news as she is the coolest mother-in-law anyone could hope for). After finally locating one Wardyn went off to get her and all her gear and less than an hour after he left the u-haul died on the side of the highway.  He had to walk half an hour to get to a phone and call them, they said "Ok no prob go back to the truck someone will be there shortly." He of course called me to let me know and I grabbed all the stiff threw it in the Hyundai Santa Fe we just bought and hauled butt to where he broke down.  Five hours after he broke down the mechanic finally showed up.  HE couldn't fix the truck so he loaded all the stuff in the u-haul into his van and took us to the nearest u-haul center where we got a new one and got back on the road again.  We didn't think any u-haul could be worse than the one we had just left. Boy were we wrong!  The shocks were shot, the radio was busted and the A/C blew out hot air even when it was off!! To top that off our 7.5 hour drive stretched to over 12 hours because the u-haul would not go over 55mph. (You have just been introduced to the U-Haul from Hell.) We finally arrive in Connecticut and it is after 10 pm and the kennel is closed until 7am so the cats get to stay in the Santa Fe for the rest of the night. The good news is we were given our house 2 days after we arrived, the bad news is they lost our household goods for a month. They finally get here tomorrow, and I go job hunting later this week.<br />
<br />
<br />
How was that for a trip to remember? I just wanted to let you all know that I missed talking to you and that I will be haunting the boards when I can pry Wardyn off my PC.<br />

What a scary story!<br />
<br />
The truth is...I probably will move...some time... We're on a 6 year plan here, aiming to move back to Norway the entire family when time is right, and I cringe at the thought of the computer equipment having to make it from A to B without nothing going wrong... <br />
<br />
I knew there was a reason i bought a solid steel computer tower...It was so when it falls off the truck it will hit the mailman and remind him not to mess with a norseman's computer equipment!<br />
<br />
I'm glad to hear you finally made it back, and if nothing else went good you are both in good health and the cats are not permanently scarred from the trip.. Possessions are material things that have no real value if it comes at the cost of your health and well being.<br />
<br />
Having said that I can imagine the pain, the frustration and overcoming the agony. Hey, maybe you can sell the rights to your story to some low budget movie company that firmly believes this will be a great movie...albeit short unless you can add on some other fun stuff.<br />

Gah! Sorry to hear about the bad move.<br />
<br />
I've moved so many times in my life, I have it down to muscle memory now. Gah.<br />
<br />
The Case and boards may be toast, but chances are the drives on the PC are just fine. Definitely try to give them a spin up unless there is a huge dent in 'em. Those things are designed to withstand more G's than we are. I see you say the drives are bent, but I'm wondering if you don't just mean the drive bays?<br />
<br />
I would think it would take more than a drop off a postal truck to bend an actual drive. Well, I'm hoping so for your sake, at least.<br />
<br />
If the drives are damaged, but you really need data off them, find some techgeek to rip them apart and try transferring the platters to an identical model housing. They won't stay running for long, probably, but will probably spin up long enough to do a dump of the data.</td>

Well the drives were actually bent as in the whole thing the circuits inside were fried and the MB fan was rattling around in the housing..joy rapture bliss. Yeppers this was one of the military moves from hell that we are all soooo familiar with lately.  Unfortunately my cat did not come through it very well we found a massive lump that is growing out of the bottom center of her ribcage and are at the moment srounging up the cash to get her to the vet for tests (the cheapest quote i have so far is about $150)<br />
