Invested in Jewel crafting about 1.3kpp to raise my skill to 190.<br />

Invested 300 pp or so in Fletching, still need more pp to raise it higher still.<br />
<br />
As for tailoring... Im stuck at 158, don't know yet how to raise it higher, I would hate failing sowing the rune on.<br />
<br />
As for components for 7th shawl, Royal Kromriff Blood is a pain, but can be purchased for about 2-5kpp ( ouch ! Im poor !! I live a life of misery !  And ppl wonder why I dont carry stacks of peridots to buff their little self... )<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">i completed the 7th shawl with only 156 tailor, and using a geerlok. was risky, i know, but unless you want to spend even more for tailoring, i found it was easyer to get the ingredients for another attempt, then to raise tailoring. as long as you don't fail the brew part with the kromif blood.<br />
<br />
hang in there!!! you guys can do it!! and once you have the 7th.. you can take a rest from tradeskills till you can either farm enough velium hound fur, and velium blocks, or save and buy them one at a time (it took me 12 fur, i had a few fails :( ) . i shoped the bazaar everyday to check the prices, and i wouldn't buy them unless were 400pp or less. the hardest part of making armor for 8th shawl was getting the unrefined stones. i did it all mostly solo. i would get a invis potion, run through the caves to make sure no shimmering were up. if none up, i would then just kill the first 3 over and over till a shimering would pop. any geonid is a PH for the shimmering. <br />
<br />
<br />
after i finaly finished all the armor, i think i had less than 100pp left in the bank.<br />
<br />
then the other day in PoV, i won a parchment drop, turned in, got the lvl 62 DoT. scribed it, pulled my master key out of the bank for ToFS (never used key since keyring thing) and ran on over. <br />
<br />
that DoT destroys just about every unded mob in that place all the way to the 6th floor. granted everything in there is not undead, well my hammer destroyed thos easy as well. <br />
<br />
well anyway, all the mobs from floor 2 up, drop at least 5 pp each, plus you get some drops that sell nice to vendors, plus a bunch of other armor and item drops off other mobs. <br />
<br />
when i got to the weding floor, floor 4 or 5.. i would stand in doorway, cast the DoT on one mob after another, even with the first one beating on me, by the time i made like my 5th cast, the first mob would die, me never hitting it once! by the time i cast on all parties in the wedding party, i would be close to oom, cast a heal on me, and then wade into the 5-6 mobs beating on me, and about every 10 sec one would die from the DoT, it was great. <br />
<br />
in two days there, about 2 hours each time, i made almost 4k!!! and that was without having the luck of getting one of the rings to drop that sell for 1.5k on drinal. then i would just sit and med, i would get FM before they repop, then soon after do it over again. was great money!! and all the weapons they drop sell for 5-6pp to vendors, plus each mob droping 5-10 pp!!! <br />
<br />
i am so excited about that place!!! i could do it without the DoT, but was alot of fun watching them drop as i just stood there :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well now i prob gave away my farming secret, well i hope not too many peeps from drinal read this, as each time i went, it was deserted or at most a couple peeps inside.<br />
<br />
oh, and on 4th floor, on the way up i killed cara both times, and both times she droped the embalmers knife, a knife that procs bandages, i sold them so fast in bazaar, first one for 150pp, it sold before i could even finish setting the prices on all my items!!! second one sold sometime last night for 175pp. also some of the mobs drop velium :-). woot!! awesome place!<br />
<br />
ok, i droned on and on, and no one prob even read this far lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
good luck on your shawls!! don't give up!!!<br />

I did my 7th shawl with a 158 + gearlock, and got it first try. Tailoring gets spending to raise. (Not as bad as smithing, imo, but still costly)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I also finished my shawl with 158 tailoring and geerlok.  Keyera suggested gathering velium hound furs once you have your 7th, I'd like to suggest getting them now, the soft fur padding isn't trivial until 176, so you have the chance for a skill up just by making those as well. :)<br />
<br />
Royal Kromriff Blood is dropped by either of the Iceshard brothers (Klaggan or Vorken) in Iceshard Keep in Kael.  If you take a group or two depending on your level, you also have the chance at getting yourself and your friends some Thurgadin plate quest armor if you trigger the 9th ring event with Doldigun.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I feel your pain.  I spent a solid 7 hours doing nothing but raising all my skills to above and beyond 170 last nite.  It turned my brain to goo doing it.  Alot of people told me that it is a waste but Im a perfection freak and couldnt let my self attempt a half @ss combine with 20 less then the trivial when what I needed for skills was right next to me at the vendor.<br />
<br />
Smithing and Tailoring am teh Debil as we say in my guild.  For tailoring I went the Hopper/Acrylia route.  Both crazy expensive on Fennin, up to 80 a block and 200 a skin.  Aside from being a semi perfectionist Im also a penny pincher and I realize most others are, usually not by choice.  <br />
<br />
So what I did was I told my chanter friend that I wouldnt rez him again if he didnt come to help me in DSP.  We camped the hopper caves when they were to crowded, he grabbed one of those NPCs over in the near by camp. Dragor Fuax I think is the best one to charm IMO.  The neat thing about these lil NPCs is back in the day I guess people were tearing them apart for exp and they are also quest NPCs.  Well VI couldnt have that so they gave them an ungodly amount of hps well over 15k.  So with this lil bad boy hasted and mini buffed I would proceed into the cave and grab every last hopper exit and DA.  When about 30 of them were on me, my chanter friend would start chain stunning.  I would drop a few AEs myself to soften them up while The False Dragon (I guess thats his name translated) would tear them a new one.  Doing this we could clear the cave in a matter of minutes and I would get about roughly 6 superb hides and plenty of other qualities, a cave load.  Do this for several hours and you will have several stacks.<br />
<br />
Acrylia is another story.  People say TM is a good place to solo but the drop rates there are literally next to nothing.  I suggest gathering up some friends and heading over to Acrylia Caverns.  If your under lvl 60 you can still get exp, although not good exp, exp none the less.  About a 2 to 3 hour session in AC with good killing speed can yield enough for 20 combines.  Also i found that the best camp is to the left of zone around the RBs pool.  The mobs are easier and only one DB (deathbringers HT for up to 600).<br />

With a Wisdom of 285 at the time was able to get my tailoring to 176 from Wus doing this in less than 2 weeks.  With a geerlok and a tailoring skill of 176 I was successful on my first attempt of the 6th shawl and I beleive Im also over the trivials for the other 2.  <br />

The Royal kromif blood I found was incredibly easy to get with only a group of above lvl 60 characters.  3 kills and 3 bloods, not very rare.  You can invis all the way to the house then single pull the giants to walk inside.  If you have a slower and a moderate lvl tank its a cake walk.  When we arrived there we were prepared for a decent camp but got all the blood we needed right off the bat so we decided to stay and do the cycle for some Thurgadin Plate drops (Also easy with a decent group).<br />

Well I have to appologizes for whoever just read this post.  I left my computer several times while writing and I might have veered off the topic.  Oh well... it is the rant and rave section. /smilewink <br />

p.s. Aside from gathering hides in DSP it was also the most fun i have ever had farming.  Running in a circle from 30 rabid hoppers cuz the chanter missed a stun and hoping sow doesnt fade is damn funny.  Ciron says to you, 'OMG ROFLMAO LOL By far the funniest thing ive ever seen!' as i run in a circle from a train of 30 mobs.</td>

I sometimes find it very relaxing to sit and do this. You can do fishing and any of the other skills w/ portable combines at the same time.  So I reach the trivials I need for most of the combines.........and BAM here comes Sony w/ the earring quest from the planes /sigh.........they just couldn't be happy w/ the amount of time we have gone insane getting the trivials we needed they had to say UP IT!!</td>

The other day, I spent 8 hours Killing wolves, mammoths and Lava Basklisks for meat and eggs, then did all the combines required to make Halas Pies, put all my wis/int gear on, got KEI, then sat down at an oven in PoK and made 80 combines on Halas Pies... 80!!.. How many skill ups? 00000 with a skill level of 190.  That night, I decided I didnt need to do more than one major tradeskill, set up a trader and sold 6k worth of silks, zombie skins, and ore I had planned on working on tradeskills with.

There was a druid that was there waiting for the dorf today. So while he was placing his pet i ran around to help with the spawn.....we had the Death squad on us 4 times and then he said he had to go. <br />
<br />
My husband came in with dinner (yes he can cook) and I sat down my cleric on the ramp while eating.....<br />
<br />
POOF almost in my lap there he was!   I said the first two lines to him and gave him my velium vial and got the note.....that druid left maybe 2 minutes before that dorf poofed in front of me.<br />
<br />
I was a very happy camper so i gated ....my bind point was in front of the bank in Thurg. YEY me time to grab my shawl in teh bank and do a turn in..........<br />
<br />
um.........where are the bankers? Where  are the merchants?     While i was being chased by the death squad they had a 10th ring War and failed. So here i am in Thurg with my little note from the dorf and I CANT do my turn in........grrrrrrr<br />
<br />
Thankyou faithstone or else i would be stuck there.</td>
