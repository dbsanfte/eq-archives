<br />
I was wondering..how do you find that guild that is perfect for you? How did you do it? <br />
Did you actively seek them or did they find you? Is there any good spot to look for guilds seeking<br />
for more members?<br />
<br />
Reason I'm asking is because I'm wanting to find a guild, a guild that suits me, a guild where I fit in.<br />
A guild where people actually speak with eachother, a guild where they are not all d00ds.<br />
<br />
I've seen some guilds recruit in shouts\OOC\etc but more often then not they are either:<br />
a) very very small, which I dont mind unless they are also the one below.<br />
b) All members are like 30 and below so I cant group with them anyway.<br />
<br />
I dont want to join any big giant raiding guild (doubt anyone of thsoe would want me anyway), they can have 5 members for all I care, just as long as they are a friendly bunch that enjoy grouping and act mature.<br />
<br />
Thing is that I dont got a clue where to start looking for one. Any advice will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Every guild I have ever joined has been because I first grouped with some of their members in pickup groups. Once I started to see multiple good players from a particular guild I would look into that guild as a potential home. That being said after being in four or five different guilds in EQ, I'm now in a guild my RL friends and family formed. It's great for guild management too. If someone in the guild acts up we just smack him/her and Sunday dinner. :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">So far I've been in one guild, was a pretty large guild compared to what I'm used to when I was on DAoC, got invited to it after I had grouped with a member of that guild. He was a really nice guy. But I didnt really fit in there so I left. <br />
<br />
One thing that should be said is I'm not a highly social player heh, sure I talk to a lot of people since I'm a cleric but I'm not actively seeking them up to group with them the next day, I just go find another pickup group. I might have 2 friends that I trust totally (one is my real life friends) so starting a guild with them is not an option heh. <br />
<br />
I would never ask either if their guild is seeking if I group with some people, 75% of the time my pickup group changes after every adventure and then I never see the people that leave again and if I do I dont remember them anyway.<br />
<br />
Usuall LDoN group (only do LDoN basically since I'm not experienced with the planes and dont got a clue where/what plan to hunt) dont have any small talk either, it's strictly talk about the mission, how the mana is, which way to go etc etc. So dont really get to know anyone that way.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up..I dont got a clue what to do to find the guild that suites me, might add that I'm in Europe and the few guild invites I've got are from USA guilds that are basically not online the time I am.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have been in two guilds thus far in my time in EQ.  My first and current guild was started as an in-game chat channel for message board friends.  We don't raid, we don't do much of anything, but they're a great bunch to just talk to.  Mostly, I use them to feed my need for talking when I get into quiet groups.<br />
<br />
My second guild found me.  To be honest, I am not entirely sure how they found me, but I got a tell out of the blue from one of them.  After a few conversations, I joined up, and immediately threw myself into the guild.  Within a month, I was an officer and head of guild activities.  I made some of the best friends I've had in EQ with that guild.  If it weren't for internal politics that caused the guild to sort of explode, I'd probably still be there.<br />
<br />
Not to helpful for your situation in either case, but you may want to just keep your eyes open.  It's pretty easy to see which guilds are having fun together.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">You all seem to have had a easy time finding one that suited your needs, problem for me is that if I group with someone let's say from a guild that is a really nice person. I dont have a clue where to start. I cant really just ask him questions about his guild out of the blue..at least I dont want to sound desperate...oh well not to desperate at least ;)<br />
<br />
Besides most of the time the group splits up after the adventure anyway and people log, I guess I could just get names and send them a tell later. But usually they are getting to bed and that is my que that they are from the states or another timezone at least.<br />
<br />
In the beginning I did ask people if they knew about any European guild on Solusek but so far I've heard of none.<br />
<br />
I knew I should have started on a Euro server hehe, but I didnt know about those when I started and I dont want to pay to get transfered thus loosing all my equipment/money. Besides I enjoy being on Solusek.<br />
<br />
Is there any web site for Solusek? Or any site about guilds recruiting on Solusek so you can check some sites, read up on some guilds or something similair? Would be so easy to seek what you are looking for that way.<br />
<br />
I think EQCleric should have a forum section dedicated to recruitments :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've been in a few guilds in my time in EQ, 9 Does that sound bad?) and I agree it is a tricky balance. Ideally you don't want to do an "/who all guild" when you log on and get the message that your request was cut short as to many players on, that usually means that your chat window will be clogged with guild chat very soon and with that number of guildies on all the time it's hard to make friends and get things organized. On the other hand you dont want to do /who all guild and find out there's only one other person on, or everyone else on is 65 and your 25 :)<br />
<br />
Ideally I like guilds where there's about a dozen players on the same time as me and they are mostly roughly my level. I joined a new guild last week and so far that seems to be the case. I've grouped with 5 or 6 of them and as I cleric it's great to have half a group of guildies ready to go at any time. Also with about a dozen on at any time you can chat and get to know them better.<br />
<br />
As it was my latest guild found me, their guild leader asked me to group with him and then invited me in and so far it looks like a great guild but it was mainly luck that I got invited in.</td>

I'm still a friend with him though but I left the guild since I never grouped with anyone but him (nobody asked either) and I never talked to anyone but him (nobody in the guild said anything anyway, except talking d00d speak and stuff like that)<br />

I don't know about sol ro server but on luclin there is a server website that lists the guilds on the server (as long as the guild leader has posted a listing) there are links to each guilds website that will give you more information about the guild. I've been in 3 guilds and all 3 I found their website before trying to find them online, but before you join, group with as many members as you can to get a feel for how they act.</td>

Though the main reason I quit was because of a game breaking bug that ruined EVERYTHING I had worked for.<br />

Anyway your right I know pretty much what I am looking for, big problem is finding a way to find it.<br />
I tried searching for a Solusek message board but didnt really find any, will give it a second go though.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">First: in my opinion, if you see a guild shouting/oocing for people to join, run -- don't walk -- away as fast as you can. It is quite likely a guild that is so interested in adding warm bodies that they aren't very discriminating about what those people are like. They may get some good people, but they are likely to go through some rough times as they separate the good from the not-so-good, and they may not survive the process.<br />
<br />
There are a number of boards that have lists of guilds on each server with links to websites, and you can actually just do your own search using a search engine like <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a> -- search for "solusek ro" and "guild" and see what you get. You can add "Everquest" if you are getting a lot of off-topic links.<br />
<br />
Here's a <a href="http://www.solusekro.com/eq/" target="_blank">site with links</a>  to 25 seemingly active guilds on solusek ro. If you don't feel comfortable talking to people about their guild, this can be a way to quietly get a peek into what the guild is like. Most guild boards have public forums -- you won't see the innermost workings of the guild, but you will likely see their charter, which will give you some idea of what type of guild they are/want to be, a roster, and generally some messages by people who are not in the guild interacting with people who are. What may be equally valuable is you get a chance to see what type of forums their guild board has, post counts to let you know how actively their members use the board, etc, to let you know if it's a guild that actively communicates. often the boards will have short clips describing the guild's latest accomplishments, screen shots, etc, that really help to give you the flavor of the guild.<br />
<br />
Look at a number of these boards to compare them against one another. keep an eye on guild tags of people you group with -- people that you like and people you don't. If you meet one or two people from the same guild and feel like they are people you would enjoy getting to know, see if you can locate their guild. If it's not on one of the lists you come across, do a web search specifically for that guild name.<br />
<br />
Guild boards almost all include a description of their recruitment procedures, and a forum where you can post a short message proclaiming your interest in checking them out.  My personal bias is to make sure that the guild is careful about who it tags -- that they require prospective recruits to group with them, attend a few guild raids or events, etc, as a way for both sides to figure out if it's a good fit. To me, this is a sign that the guild is interested in maintaining a sense of stability and camraderie, and is not going to tag anything that breathes simply to have more bodies to throw at the next dragon. <br />
<br />
A few other tips: check for a calandar of events, or any indication of the kinds of activities that they are currently involved in -- are these things you are interested in doing and that you would be able to take part in at your level? Also, try to get a feel for the typical time slot when members are active. Sometimes the guild's web site will state what time zone(s) they base their raiding on (or, if you can see their calendar, check what time they schedule events for). If not, do some /who all "guild name" commands at various times, and see when they have the most people on, when they seem to be gathering, etc. It's definitely a good idea to do this anyway for any guild you feel like joining: If they never seem to have more than a couple people on during hours that you typically play, it's probably not going to be a good fit.<br />
<br />
Good luck! Being in a guild that feels comfortable is important. Take your time and explore your options until you find one you like.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Do a Google search with the name of the guild. If the name of the guild alone isn't sufficient, try adding the word Everquest and the name of your server to the search. Many guilds have websites where you can look into the guild philosophy (if they have one) and see the roster of members and how they balance out in terms of races/classes/levels, etc. If you find one you think you might like, find out who the officers are and if they're recruiting new members and what their requirements are.</td>

<br />
First guild I joined was when I was level 15 or so and it was called "Shadows Light" they were a very cool group of people, but one day I logged on and  the guild was gone...<br />
<br />
Second guild I joined was called "Forsaken Fellowship" BEST GUILD! They were awesome! I joined them because two friends of mine I had been grouping with (Jotahn and Naryan, Beastlord, and Druid) had wanted me to join up. But I decided to leave the guild a few months ago because currently I am stationed in Germany and most of the guild was in California so I was never on the at the same time..<br />
<br />
Third guild (and one im still in now) is Veni Vidi Mori. Really great guild, a lot of people in Europe for me to group with, and very friendly. Not really many raids, but the game isnt all about raiding now is it? ;) Besides im still kinda low for that (Level 52 and proud of it! ;)) <br />
<br />
Yup thats basically it..</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I was lucky in that I found my guild relatively early (my shadowknight was level 35; this toon didn't even exist). I found it because I knew a couple people who were in a guild called Company of Wandering Souls. I was JUST about to ask them about COWS when I noticed that one of them, Jhet, had a different guild tag. I asked him about it and he directed me to two of the nicest people I've ever met online -- the new guild leader of Crimson Snow and her husband. We talked, I liked them, their play style and ages matched mine. They expressed a desire to build a family, slowly and carefully over time, to pick more mature players (the average age of CSers is probably now about 30 -- I should do a poll to figure it out; I know we have a few older teens but we have members in their 50s as well), and to build a no-pressure guild where people could grow and learn at their own pace. It matched my idea of a guild, so I joined. Shortly afterward, I was asked to become an officer, and today there are over 300 toons in CS (probably 50-60 active members). We haven't strayed from our original vision either. We're not an uber guild by any means, but we are solid, have a nice record of accomplishments, and more importantly, stay true to our original belief system.<br />
<br />
Compare this to what happened to my then-level 5 enchanter, Eliste (she's 40 now). I was running her around in EC hunting bugs or some such, and was sitting down to rest. A guild that shall remain nameless (it was  young at the time; it's grown a bit since then, but I still have no respect for them) was shouting in EC about how they were on a "recruiting drive".  Now, although I was in Crimson Snow, I hadn't had this particular toon tagged yet, so I was tagless. This guy runs up and suddenly I see the guild invite box on my screen.<br />
<br />
Puzzled, I declined. Brief pause. It flashes up there again.<br />
<br />
I declined again and sent a tell "Excuse me, there must be some mistake. I've never even talked to anyone in your guild before. You must have me confused with someone else."<br />
<br />
He sent a tell back that said something like, "No mistake. We're on a recruiting drive."<br />
<br />
THIS is their idea of a recruiting drive? Going around to untagged folks in newbie zones and inviting them without so much as a howdy-do? I've never gotten a good GROUP that way and I can imagine what kind of guild I'd get.<br />
<br />
I told him I was already guilded but just wasn't tagged yet. He went on and I noticed that they DID manage to pick up about 10 new members this way at least. <br />
<br />
Best way to find a guild is find people you like, whose play styles match your own, visit their guild website, talk to people about the reputation of the guild. You're wearing the "union label" after all, and that guild's baggage will be applied to you by default. There are guilds on my server where I will happily invite members to a group without reservation, and there are some guilds I will NOT invite to a group because my experiences with their guild members have been overwhelmingly negative.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that I have only ever had one guild, do realize that a guild membership is not permanent and if it isn't working out for one reason or another, you have the power to leave. OTOH, guilds do talk to each other, and people who get the reputation of "guild hopping" may not get into their preferred guilds.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I really liked the guild I'm in now when I first joined.  I had known the guildleader for a quite a while (not realizing they were a GL) and when I finally made the leap, everyone in the guild was incredibly accepting and were almost always willing to form up a guild group at the top of a hat.  Basically, my guild kicks butt.  Problem is, this big, snotty, know-it-all "uber" cleric who used to be in the guild came back, and since then it hasn't been much fun.  All I ever here is "Yay-me-this" and "Yay-me-that"... gets kinda tedious.  Doesn't help any that he's now working for my favorite online Cleric site, either.  I mean, if it weren't for that big headed...<br />
<br />
But, I digress.  Main thing is, no matter how you find a guild, or what you're looking for, don't be afraid to change your mind.  I was actually in another guild when I joined Antaean, but I'd only talked to one person in the other (the one who invited me, and only that one time).  Knew almost right away that the other guild wasn't for me, but still had a twinge of guilt as I left.  Glad I did, though, 'cause like I said, my guild is righteous.<br />
<br />
As for the big-headed, "uber" cleric, well.  Maybe I'll just have Agmy beat him up for me... oh, wait a minute...<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Watching that site right now stratys, Thanks a bunch for the link. I actually remember some of the guild names that are there from my time hunting with pickup groups. And I can tell you that I would never join a guild that shouts for members (unless they got a interesting name and I talk to them first and asks about the ground rules and goals, stuff like that).<br />
<br />
Heh and I got one guild that I will NEVER EVER group with again..a little quick rant:<br />
/Rant on<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a warrior and these three guys want to join up. They speak extremely bad english but I dont really judge people by it. So we let them join and we are telling them that the warrior is pulling (was in DSP by the way). So they ask me for mana regen, I tellt hem I dont have any mana regen. <br />
<br />
Before we know it one of them comes running with a couple of those tribals. So we kill them and I tell them that the warrior is pulling. They say ok. Good good I think. So the warrior heads off to pull. I look around and two of them are missing, just me and the beastlord left. Warrior gets back starts whacking on the tribal when those two came running back with one each. I *sighs* to myself and root them before they reach us completely. <br />
<br />
After the fight I tell them that the warrior is pulling dammit! They say ok and ask me for mana regen! So I'm starting to get a bit impatient and tell them that I'm a cleric and I cant cast any mana regen on them. Guess what they say?..Yupp they said Ok. Told them that the warrior was pulling....they say...ok.<br />
<br />
Still they keep pulling and asking for mana regen!!! That's when the warrior and I leave them alone.<br />
I did group with one of them another time..but that was the last time was about the same as the first one excep I guess he got his mana regen because he didnt ask me about it.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Oh well back on topic...uhm where was I..oh right I'm going to check out the site now, Thanks all for telling your stories on how you did it and coming up with some tips & tricks for me. Appreciate it!</td>
