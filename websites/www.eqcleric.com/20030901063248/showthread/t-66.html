Hehe Just joking around with that one. <br />

I always watch the action on raids because I am one of those clerics watchs everyone to see if they are getting hit by AoE, Rampage, Whatever. I click so much on people it is not funny while keeping an eye on my groups HP(which I agree is from sitting with that book in my face) I have actually hit My F3 button and Hotkey to com heal a war in my group while I was playing my warrior once boy did the raid get a kick out of that one What made it better was that Hot key was my CHARGE VOX NOW key I was the MA.<br />
<br />
I also have this VERY bad habbit of not watching my own HP, a dead cleric can not help the raid but Luckly my wife used to play a druid and was always watching my hp to heal me because I hardly ever did that now when she plays her bard she still watches my health bar and tells me to heal myself if I do not notice it:p</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I remember when they lowered the spellbook requirement from 50 to 35.<br />
<br />
I was level 50 (a druid at the time, hadn't made the cleric that turned into my main yet), sitting in the hot tub in Mistmoore with a couple friends camping Xicotl.  We'd heard rumors that the spellbook was going to go away for those above level 35, but it had not been posted in a patch message yet.  My friend, a cleric, stood up and started screaming OMG OMG OMG!!! She said she'd just been sitting, without her book open, very lom.  When she stood up, the mana bar filled.<br />
<br />
I tried it, and sure enough - my mana bar filled when I stood up.  It was bugged at first - your bar didn't go up while sitting unless you were behind your spellbook, but your mana was regening as if you were medding even though it didn't show.  I don't recall myself feeling cheated because people who were level 35 didn't have to go through 15 more levels of spellbooks than I did, perhaps I was just too thrilled that I'd never have to look at it again (well... then after that I made the cleric and was I ever eager to hit 35).<br />
<br />
Yeah, people who start EQ these days have it a lot easier than we did, long ago when there were very few clerics high level enough to do a res, there was no clarity spell or assist feature, and the Guise of the Deceiver that was usable by all from inventory still dropped in Lower Guk.  Does that ruin the game for me or for them?  It doesn't for me, I guess time will tell if it does for them.  <br />
<br />
I do know that I'm sick to death of getting tells from some level 19 three zones away wanting me to run over to res them.  My res rule now is I won't cross a zone line for someone who is anon.  They show themselves or get someone else.  If they're under level 30, I'm not going out of my way to res them unless they are bound far away from their corpse (and then they have to listen to my lecture on how they take things others can do for them too much for granted and they need to take some responsibility for their own game, not rely upon finding someone who will give up their own personal game time to benefit a total stranger).</td>

<br />
I like those that make an effort to have a unique and funny way of asking for rez. If I like a person I'll travel around the world of EQ to rez them. I have a relaxed rule for clerics 30+. I try to be kind to my fellow clerics whenever I can.<br />
<br />
I remember having past 35 when they removed the spellbook mandate, and I didn't feel cheated, but I do think the clerics who did experience the spellbook view have a greater patience and appreciation for the art of a cleric.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">You're so right. I remember, back in the day we had to stare at the spellbook while medding, we had to start at it while casting, we even had to stare at the spell book when running around. Mobs would attack clerics first, and the tanks didn't have the taunt skill so we had to be really good at managing agro. We didn't have any weapons but had to use our summoned hammer, which was crappy because it would poof 10 minutes after we sumoned it. We didn't have plate armor and had to use cloth, and the cloth had holes in it from where we bumped into trees while running around with our noses in the spell book. There were no heal spells above minor heal, and we had to have 5 clerics in every group to heal our tank with minor healing. If you died, you not only had to do cr, you had to buy all your holey clothes over again because the mobs could loot your body and they'd hold the armor ransom until you gave them 10pp. And everyone would just go "rez now k thx" and never, ever, donate any money.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have been playin EQ for about 3 years now. All the changes are envitable especially with the game growing as it is. I wouldnt worry about all the clerics popping up either. Most people who dont start as clerics dont make it very high level. It takes a certain type of player to be able to play a cleric (patient type). <br />
Beggars-- THis used to bother me alot. But I have gotten use to it. Now I have fun entertaining ways of dealing with these people or I just ignore them all together. Lowbies can usually be dealt with easily. noob - "Buffs plz" me "250pp plz"<br />
Usually they will leave you alone, if not I ignore them unless they get rude. <br />
Higher level beggars can be fun to mess with. If they are real obnoxious about it I will say ok and give them lvl 9 buffs, usually they get my point =)</td>

The only thing I wasnt sorry to see go were the earlier hell levels I luckily got to miss those :)</td>

I said target me, face east, and type /due to pay your dues to Brell.  He did.  I accept duel, and promptly keeled him dead dead dead.  He wasn't too happy cause he wasn't bound anywhere near there.  I told him to think about harassing people during the long run back.</td>

I tend to help anyone that asks for it.  If I am hunting I set up an appropriate time to help when I gate for a KEI refresh or go to town to sell stuff.  I also generally spend the first hour of my play time each session offering help.</td>

 It's our way of paying homage to when we were newbies and cursing that rusty weapon we had, or wishing we could get a small heal to get back to wacking rats, bats and bugs quicker.</td>
