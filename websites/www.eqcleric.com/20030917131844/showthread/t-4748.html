<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">SKs and Paladins have similar abilities of Aggro Control and general tanking skills. Both can lock down aggro fairly easily and  they each take a blow about the same. SKs have an easier time losing it on themselves (FD), but that's rarelly good when they are MT. With HT, spears, life taps SKs can do more all out damage when needed too over paladins and FD can be handy in pulling. Still, Paldins tend to have an easier time getting a mob off a groupmate or protecting them somehow (i.e. with stuns, loh, root, or a nicely timed heal), they can cut the healing load on the cleric, and they can rez if the worst happens. They also tend to fit with an role playing vision of a cleric better (with all races except dark elf, of course). So, all things considered, I'd probably go with paladin. Though, both knight classes are comparable in abilities. <br />
<br />
Warriors are obviously the better tanks for difficult battles, as they are the better defensive tanks. While they lack the powers of snap aggro (as they rightly should to make knights a viable choice for tanks), they still are solid exp group tanks (with slightly different tactics) and the only good choice for particularly difficult battles.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">With the proper weapons and knowledge I say Warrior.  Again, I am biased because my main is a one.  Having procing weapons keeps the mob angry at you (of course they hate it more when a Pally stuns em - same goes if a cleric or chanter stun in a fight).  If the slower or another caster get aggro for some reason (resists, etc.) then the Warrior can use that /shield thing - which does work, just most people don't know how to use it.  It helps add points to their 'hate' list.<br />
<br />
Then there is also the player.  If they know how to play their class then they will know how to get aggro.  Oh, this mob hates it when I sit down..... sit... stand attack.  Who'd of thought a melee would sit during a fight, but it works if the mob starts making a run at a friend of yours.<br />
<br />
I will admit though, the general norm of the Warrior's is that they cannot keep aggro.  I have had to prove myself over and over again.  Sometimes making deals that if I don't do a sufficient job then they can kick me out.  I haven't been kicked out yet... and I always get the "Oh I thought all Warriors sucked, but you actually know what you are doing."  OK I like compliments so I thought I'd share :) .<br />
<br />
Stunning a mob to keep aggro is easy.  Harm touching the mob is easy.  It's the ones who have to do without those items that has a hard job... and for that I think they are the best tanks.  (To those that just hit 'A' and go afk - bite me - you have made Warrior's lives worse)</td>

<br />
First, SK's dont have to be healed as constantly, as the ahve life tap! woot it heals them durring the fight! on the other hand, Pallies have actual heal spells so they can heal other groupies (including the cleric) and they have the coveted LoH which can save a life, or potentialy waste on.<br />
<br />
So my vote does go to Paladins for the reasons above, the reasons previously stated, and the reasons paraphrased along with the fact that its just more fun being with a class thats alot like you (druid-ranger, cleric -pally, shamman-bst)</td>

The guy can keep aggro on himself almost all the time. IF a ranger or high DPS character pulls it then they dont have it for long. Within 3 seconds this guy has it back again. He's amazing!. And he's not some uber planer warrior or a guy with a ton of gear. He just knows his class and role THAT WELL.</td>

The Pally can take agro away at a moments notice, and hold it once he has it, easily.  The warrior does have some procing weapons, but nothing major.  For raid groups, I always try to have that pally in my group. He rocks, and I seldome get hit for more than a second or 2 if I draw agro.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The problem with warriors is that they need enraging blow weapons above and beyond the epic to hold aggro.  In a raid, warriors are what you want to tank.  In a group, I always get ticked off when I'm in PoV and theres a 61 warrior tanking (they always replace themselves with other 61 warriors).  These people dont have the equip and stats to tank mobs, yet they do.  I have met 2 pallies that I specially like to tank, and sks can usually hold their own.  The difference for battle clerics? Pallies slowly turn the mob, sks keep em straight.  Watch and see, you'll notice it.</td>

warriors as MA in big encounters tho. but also i don't mind them in exp groups either, all 3 do a very good job. just keep me away from tanking rangers :-)</td>

Thats right kids.  What more can you want than a tank that grabs agro with slow.. has great DPS for your group, and buffs your mana with SD and Paragon!? Actually while on this topic.. i'd fill an entire exp group with some highly AA'd BLs and be quite pleased.   Nothing like an exp group with an effective 12 tanks in it.   Cheers</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hehe.. Hank.. After my experience a few weeks ago, I would have to say that BL's are kick butt. Was in PoI with a freind, and he had to leave. I ask this 61 BL if he wants a partner, as he is killing one, then medding/healing then pulling another, slowly, as my Pally buddy and I were doing. So I join up with him, drop hero, shield and Symbol of Marzin on both BL and Pet, He hits me with SP or whatever version a 62 has and pulls.  First pull is an Archaic and a rusty. I am thinking, great Gonna have to zone first pull.... /laugh.  His pet soo ruled that rusty it wasnt funny, and he slaughtered the Archaic as well.  I ended the fight at 90%mana.<br />
Next pull was the 2 Tin Soldiers. CH pet for 2600 hp, and the BL for 2200hp, Now,I'm a little nervous, but half way thru the fight, I got my first Paragon experience... and I must say OMG... <br />
<br />
We slaughtered for about an hour, Ding #4 AA. and Page 3.  3 more pages to go for Cloak of the wise.</td>

For "MT", I guess I'm just so used to raiding that I will always say warrior except in special circumstances.  For a regular exp group tank, whoever wants to hold agro and has the most HP is fine...beastlords with lots of hp are fantastic at holding agro, SK/Pal are both obviously supurb tanks...I suppose I'm partial to SKs tho, since I keep one in my pocket as well...I think all the good clerics do :P</td>

With their assorment of stuns and Attack/HP/AC Cleric type spells they hold agro well and I think are more self sufficient that SK or Warrior...they can always give themselves that topoff heal prior to them pulling (this is for a different forum whenever that forum comes to be...but I LOVE having a Paladin pull...so consistent).  Against undead I don't think there is a better MT...seen a 54 pally keep agro from a 50 warrior in Veksar before.  Anyway...Paladins in my opinion are the better just because they are less of a mana sponge in the end (no need for a top off and stuns which reduce dps of mobs).  Never leave home with out one.</td>

Both classes can keep aggro very well but, I had to choose a shadow knight for one simple reason.  They can be large races and expecially ogres.  While the race usually doesn't make a difference the addition of slam can help with those annoying casters, also the fact that ogres can't be stunned from the front gives an ogre SK a huge advantage over say a Dwarf paladin.  If it was between say a human sk or human paladin it really wouldn't make that much of a difference in the long run.</td>

They also have the additional benefits of snaring, helping to keep their own life up with lifetaps, skellie pets for more melee power, and FD so we don't need to waste time rezzing them if the mob manages to be faster than the CH >_<  That being said, I think pallies and warriors can do a great job too and would gladly let any one of them take hits before me ;)</td>
