<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">On Saturday, Hawkestone woke the Sleeper on Xev. Needless to say, quite a few people were upset about this, as Xev was one of only a handful of servers (five I believe) to have the Sleeper still... well, sleeping. <br />
<br />
Anyway, they claim they wanted to see new content, but after thinking about it for awhile and discussing it with others, I'm throwing a bullshit flag. On Xev, there was an unwritten rule of not killing all the warders--it really is that simple. The most "uber" guilds on our server have respected this unwritten rule for years (regardless if it was to farm ST) yet, some 30 or so people in Hawkestone opt to go against the wishes of the majority? <br />
<br />
WTF?<br />
<br />
My guild is by no means the most "uber" on Xev. But, we have been progressing very quickly over the past few months. And we figure to be in ST and NToV by the end of the summer. But now, the thought of ST isn't so appealing to me anymore. Yeah, obviously there is some very good gear there for everyone, although some incomprable pieces are now lost, so doing ST for us is anything but a waste... but, it's different now.<br />
<br />
I've commented on this board and on other boards that EQ is just a game... as a whole, just pixels and a good time waster. Obviously, emotion is invested here, but in a limited fashion. But, this evening while pondering the actions of Hawkestone, I've come to a realization of how much EQ is a microcosm of real life. And how, no matter how big or small something is, someone out there will flip you the literal or figurative finger. Hawkestone, by there actions in game and on various message boards, illustrated to me just how inconsiderate and selfish people can be. In particular, one member consistently /shrugged at the grievances people brought forth.<br />
<br />
I realize now that there were two main goals I had when I first started playing EverQuest. The first was to get my Epic, which I long ago accomplished. And the second, which seemingly was within my grasp, was to take a screenshot of the Sleeper still deeply in his slumber. Hawkestone took this second goal from me and countless others--forever.<br />
<br />
EQ might well be a game, but how utterly disappointed I was at bravado and selfishness displayed by this guild on my server. With that said, grats Hawkestone for doing what the server as a whole wished not to be done. Grats for doing what numerous guilds could have done years ahead of you. Grats for taking an EQ experience from me what other guilds so kindly and considerately left for you. So it goes, I guess. People--even when playing "just a game"--still suck.</td>

<br />
I know of one guild whose claim on their guild webpage was "training Norrath since...."  They seemed to take great pride in being jerks, and I saw nothing to indicate this was even remotely intended as humor.<br />

you said you wanted to get a screen of him still sleeping, is this possible to do without<br />

The Sleeper cannot be taken down. Someone remarked to me that the best he's been taken down to was 96%. How true that is, who knows.<br />

<br />
There's a long explanation as to "what" he is, but in essence, he's a bad ass dragon that has been imprisoned by the good guy dragons--Temple of Veeshan faction. There are four warders--good guy dragons--in the Sleeper's Tomb (ST) that "guard" the Sleeper, ensuring that he will not wake up. If all four warders are killed, then Sleeper wakes up and kills a bunch of people. The rule in Xev was that thou shall not kill all the warders--I think it was the 1st one, but who knows. This ensured that the Sleeper would remain asleep indefinately.<br />

Typically, the sleeper was woken very quickly as many guilds were unaware of the loot that the warders dropped. BTW, the warders would respawn over a 3 day cycle (perhabps longer, I am not sure)<br />

Yup. He visits SS and wipes out some dragons. I also heard he visits other zones with good guy dragons in them. Not 100% sure, however.<br />
<br />
Now, how does the Sleeper being awake change the server? Really, not by much. A gnome illusion mask is no longer available--but now a dwarf one is. Primal weapons are no longer available, but instead they are Prismatic. However, two very important other types of drops are no longer available--a monk BP with 15 regen on it and a tank weapon with awesome taunt. The taunt weapon can be replaced, however by the PoI dragon drop. The BP, however, is pretty hard to top. The BP, btw is replaced with a 41% haste item instead--which doesn't compare, of course.<br />
<br />
Now, where do these drops come from? Well, instead of having warders that spawn, you have something called ancients. The Sleeper, however, will never come back.<br />
<br />
What's so important about it... for most, it marked the pinacle of success, so to speak. Remember how I mentioned before about the ToV quest being a rite of passage for every young cleric, as it was a very good, questable item? Well, seeing the  Sleeper sleeping on Xev was kind of like a rite of passage for entry into "uber land" so to speak. In addition, it was a symbol of cooperation among our high level guilds--it was a symbol of respect among all. And now, of course, it's gone for a crappy will 15 minute code that didn't work properly... such a waste.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see if the countless threats made on xevserver.com against Hawkestone will be followed through.</td>

Apologies, firstly, for snipping, since what the rest said was very true.  The bit I left is what I wanted to remark on.<br />
<br />
I have heard and been a long time supporter of the saying:  "Your rights end at the tip of your nose and toes."  In other words, <u>your</u> rights in no way, shape, or form, overrule or overwrite another players' rights.  Since everyone's rights on Xev cancel each other out regarding the Sleeper, then accepted rules within the community <b>should</b> have been followed.  This blatant disregard for those rules is simply a guild being very selfish.<br />
<br />
Hawkestone had no more "right" to wake the sleeper than anyone else had a "right" to demand he be kept asleep.  If the majority of the players on that server want the Sleeper to remain asleep, any mature, civilized person should be able to go by what the community has agreed upon.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact if I played on Xev that the only thing a member of Hawkestone would receive from me is a cold shoulder.</td>

No need to apologize. :) <br />

Waking the Sleeper is not necessarily "bad," as technically waking him is part of the EQ story; however, on a practical or pragmatic level, it doesn't make too much sense. There are two major pieces that drop only when the Sleeper is asleep. Once he wakes, those pieces are no more. And, one of those pieces--although the name alludes me--happens to be (supposedly) the second best monk bp in the game. No more sleeper--no more bp.<br />
<br />
Now, from an intellectual standpoint, someone posted that the Sleeper is an intelligence test: "The four warders guarding the Sleeper were an intelligence test - if you passed the test and killed all four then you proved you were an idiot."<br />
<br />
From a romantic viewpoint, the Sleeper was/is the most powerful mob in the game. And, guess what? If you were on Xev before Hawkestone opted to go against the serverwide wishes to keep the Sleeper snoozing, you could see that mob in all its glory. Hell, you could smell it or even touch it--figuratively--all the while taking screenshots. Silly? Of course. But, was it important to the people on Xev? There's a 36 page argument on our server message board about the issue, so yeah, I guess it was. But now? Well, to quote a little girl who witnessed the conflgration taht consumed the marvelous World's Columbian Exposition of 1893: "O, it's all over."</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My server opened (a split server; the Rathe and E'ci) in March of 2001, shortly after Velious went live.  My guild, which was started on the new server by friends who movelogged together, had just started killing the First Brood, before Luclin.  We had been farming Kael armor in West ToV for what seemed like forever.  We had eleven keys to Sleeper's; we'd not yet killed Sontalak or Yelinak.<br />
<br />
I'll never forget the day the "uber" guild on our server decided to take that content away from the rest of us.  They'd been farming Sleeper's all by themselves for months (well, another guild had been there as well, but they'd disbanded); they said they wanted to "finish up Velious before the expansion."  Zeb is a rabidly FCFS server, I guess really I'd not have it any other way - one of the reasons I movelogged was the silly thing that the "calendar" on the Rathe had become.<br />
<br />
It was a long time ago, but I will never forget how sad I was that I'd never be able to see Kerafyrm for myself.  Still have regrets about it, but such is life.  Not enough regrets to, say, tear up my roots and move when they opened - whatever that new server that they took transfers to.<br />
<br />
Well, we moved on - we continued to kill First Brood, we succeeded in killing Sontalak and Yelinak.  We had 3 groups worth of keyholders.  We went to Sleeper's and started the long farming session to equip our melee in primal.  The zone was so imposing; it obviously was a prison - when I saw the Final Arbitor for the first time, I nearly couldn't breathe.  Then the squares on the four corners where the Warders used to guard their prisoner.  And the empty bubble.<br />
<br />
We farmed that zone hard.  Gods but by the end of it I was nearly insane.  Because the utility of the zone had been altered; nothing existed for anyone there but melee - we'd restricted key awards to as few healers as we could get away with.  I felt like a machine /uhoh   <br />
<br />
I've not been back since the changes were put in.  I don't know what the zone feels like now.  For me, it felt too much like work to want to return.<br />
<br />
I hope that Sony never again gives content that one group of people can remove from the game.  Magnificent as the Kerafyrm story is... mobs repop all over Norrath to be killed again - or to kill us.  I cannot imagine what difference it would have made to keep the content there.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Apologies to Galv, but I think perhaps some of his answers need further clarification.<br />
<br />
<b>1) What is the sleeper exactly?</b><br />
<br />
Kerafym, offspring of Nagafen and Vox in a mating prohibited by the dragons.  The most powerful critter anywhere, ever, and quite literally unkillable.<br />
<br />
Estimated to have 3.28 million hit points, Kerafym is the only known critter to be able to death touch anything in the whole zone.  He does so every ten seconds, far faster than the other death touching critters.<br />
<br />
He is unkillable because any force large enough to have a chance at killing him, would also be so large that it would crash the zone concerned.<br />
<br />
<b>2) How has this been dealt with on other servers?</b><br />
<br />
He has been awakened by the first or second guild into Sleepers Tomb.  Only on Xev did the leading guilds have the courtesy and respect to leave him alive for the people who followed.<br />
<br />
There were a dozen or so guilds who progressed through Sleepers without waking Kerafym, and they did so over the course of several years.<br />
<br />
I am very proud of the fact that when I did Sleepers Tomb, I was one of those who voted not to waken the Sleeper.  Many guilds followed in our wake making the same decision, even after the Sleepers Tomb revamp.<br />
<br />
<b>3) Can it be put back to sleep?</b><br />
<br />
A GM or programmer could presumably do it.  There is no way within the game to do so, though; the script was intentionally writted to be a one-time-only, unrepeatable, irreversible server event.<br />
<br />
<b>4) Has anyone ever tried?</b><br />
<br />
No, see the answer to 3.<br />
<br />
<b>5) What is the role of the warders or do they respawn?</b><br />
<br />
The power of the four warders keeps Kerafym asleep.  They used to respawn every five days, providing that at least one of them was left alive.  When all four were killed at the same time, Kerafym was awoken, and the warders ceased to exist permanently.<br />
<br />
Since the zone has been revamped, they will presumably be replaced with the new Ancients.  This is actually a benefit to clerics, since the Ancients drop WIS caster loot; in Sleepers Tomb on Xev prior to 8/6/03, there was no WIS caster loot in the zone.<br />
<br />
<b>6) Can they help?</b><br />
<br />
No, the warders must be dead for Kerafym to be awake.<br />
<br />
<b>7) I've heard that the sleeper eventually starts zone hopping, is this true?</b><br />
<br />
Theoretically, Kerafym was supposed to move from Sleepers' Tomb to Skyshrine where he would kill his rival Lord Yelinak before vanishing.  In practise, this did not happen because the script was bugged.</td>

Whether it's right or wrong, will always be debatable. Bottom line is that most guilds did it back in the day, as a "****block" so other guilds would be slower to progress through Velious content. Alot of guilds also like the allure of setting off a one-time event.<br />
<br />
As to the situation on Xev, it is truely a shame to have such a long-standing serverwide agreement broken after all this time. The revamped Sleeper's, while offering more loot of different types, as well as quests, just isn't quite the same.<br />

Kerafym is NOT their offspring, as Naggy and Vox were never allowed to mate. They tried, and were punished, but they never "did the deed". This was confirmed at a fanfaire a few years back, when a Dev was holding a Q & A about Kerafym. While he wouldn't say who Kerafym's parents were (Some people theorized that it was Yeli/Hsagra, but that is also not true), he confirmed that it was not Naggy/Vox.</td>

<br />
I hear two different stories on Sullon Zek about wether or not the Sleeper has been woken on the server. All that say yes cannot say by whom (wich its such a monumental event why would no one remember it) and those that say it hasnt have very good back up and are realiable sources.<br />
<br />
Above was mentioned that primal changes to prismatic. The weapons dropping currently are prismatic, but the top guild on our server currenty says that this is only due to the revamp, not to the sleeper being woken. I have not maid it up to the actual room with the guardians and the sleeper itself to know for sure.<br />
<br />
I was speaking with the top guild on the server and heard he was attempted once by the two top ranking evil guilds at that time, dont exactly remember who it was. They made it to the final guardian and died, and decided not to attempt it again.<br />
<br />
What kind of clues, other than checking the spawn itself, could i tell on wether or not it had been woken. One that would garuntee it wasnt due to a revamp. Is there a certain mob somewhere that would not be up? Or would be in a different spot?<br />
90% of the people say he has not been woken, the ones that say he has said it was done by <Hate> who all deny they did it.<br />
<br />
I think a large reason he would not have been successfully attempted is due to how our server works. It makes cross teaming it nearly impossible, it limits some key classes from individual teams helping. The evil team, currently the largest and the strongest all lack an extra 1khp on raid buffs due to not having druids. the goodies and the neuts lack the numbers I think.</td>

If you were to get the details on the dragon names here, that should determine if Kerafyrm is still asleep. From what I understand, he's still asleep on the PvP servers and the new servers.

<br />
All of the above four dragons are in Sleepers' Tomb, and they no longer spawn.<br />
<br />
However, there are four new dragons called "Ancients" rather than "Warders" who spawn in their place.  I have yet to fight these creatures and I don't know in what way they are different to the Warders.  I do know, from reading posts from people who have, that their loot is different.  Specifically, the loot is better for clerics, druids, and shamen, and worse for warriors and monks.<br />
<br />
According to everything I've read and heard, the four "Ancients" do indeed drop Ancient Prismatic weapons.<br />
<br />
The Master of the Guard does indeed still spawn.  He's not precisely the same as he was before; Xev used to have the "new" MOTG encounter which had been implemented in the old-style zone, and it was buggy to say the least.  Since the Sleeper was awakened, the MOTG encounter is no longer so buggy and therefore much easier to complete.<br />
<br />
The Progenitor and the Final Arbitor also still spawn, and I believe that they are now guaranteed to drop Ancient Prismatic weapons.  For all I know, there may be new named further in as well, but I have not been down to the bottom since 8/6/03 and I can't confirm that either way.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'm told that once the Sleeper has been awakened, random yard trash in Sleepers Tomb also have a small chance to drop Ancient Prismatic weaponry.  That certainly wasn't the case before.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would say that it's somewhat easier to obtain Ancient Prismatic weapons now than it used to be to obtain Primals.</td>

However, a Rogue with Shroud of Stealth used to be able to run right to the bottom of Sleepers' Tomb and tickle Kerafym's tummy, and therefore it's pretty much a safe bet that a rogue could tell what's online and what isn't.<br />

I took my boyfriends bard to ST yesterday (we were planning to farm primals but the mobs were not up!) and used Eye of Zomm wall bug to poke around the zone.  I managed to get it into the sleepers chamber room once and it answered all my questions concerning wether or not he had been woken on the server.<br />
<br />
Sad to say, first thing I saw were two dragons. Both were ancients. I moved the eye around until I spotted the dome, which to my dissapointment was empty. <br />
<br />
Prior to this I put a post on the website of the guild im apping to to find out some more info. <br />
<br />
After I poked around ST, leaving in dissapointment, I read the board and found out by someone who was THERE that he had been woken quite some time ago by the guild <Hate> (not sure if others were included) and that the script had also been buggy on the server at the time. When the fourth warder was slain nothing happened. No deaths, no destruction.  They petitioned and got a GM (wow, GM's on Sullon that really was a while ago! LOL) to come. The GM respawned the fourth warder several times to be rekilled to see if that would set it off. To their dissapointment, nothing occured, however they did get some extra warder loot.<br />
<br />
My question on wether or not a patch was implimented to wake the sleeper on all servers has not yet been answered. I know that was the case on Vallon. They had a GM event waking him while a good friend of mine was online. My boyfriend was over at his house when it happened aswell. (or so I am told is how it happened).<br />
<br />
My boyfriend insists that this has occured and usually he is right, however if these recent events concerning xev did occur, then that is not true.... Any answers?</td>

However, Sony did have a patch that revamped ST for after the Sleeper snorts awake. Perhaps that is about what you're thinking.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Actually there are two issues here.  The first is the waking of the Sleeper, and the second is a patch (quite some time ago) that revamped the Sleepers' Tomb zone.<br />
<br />
Before the patch, there were no "Ancients" and no "Ancient Prismatic."  As I understand it, waking the Sleeper caused the Warders to stop spawning, to be replaced with... nothing.<br />
<br />
Also before the patch, as I can personally confirm, Dire Charm used to work in Sleepers' Tomb, and some of the encounters worked differently.  There's nothing like tanking the Master of the Guard with a 30khp Dire Charmed golem to trivialize an encounter.<br />
<br />
After the patch, the Ancients came in and the zone became the Sleepers Tomb we have on most servers today.<br />
<br />
However, on a few servers (notably Xev) the Sleeper was not awakened before the patch.  So we had a sort of hybrid zone... the new-style MoTG and an end to Dire Charmed golems, but with Warders instead of Ancients and Kerafym still slumbering down there at the bottom.<br />

My concern is that two of my good friends who happened to be on VZ at the time of the sleeper waking say that no guild woke him, but instead it was awoken in a GM event planned for apparently all servers to advance the plotline.<br />
<br />
The text concerning Sleeper's Tomb in EverQuest Atlas: The Maps of Myrist leads me to believe that either he has already been awoken on all servers, or is intended to be soon. This does not seem at all possible with what has happened on Xev as of late, though my boyfriend insists that it has. Is there a possiblity that this only happened on a few servers and some were left untouched? (though i dont see why that would be) Or can someone who was there for the waking of the sleeper on VZ confirm that a guild woke him instead of a GM?</td>
