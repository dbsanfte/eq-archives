Seems like Sony doesnt want Clerics around much anymore.... the comments were "The healing changes in general are aimed at significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations. While we certain maintain that clerics should be the best at healing, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting."<br />
<br />
Now Shammies will have the slows and the heals for many groups while clerics well... what do we have that is unique?  When mana is not an issue why have a cleric?</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">On the other hand...  what is the one class a group will never leave home without?  Cleric.  It's also unfair to expect a cleric to be required in every group, when other classes (oh, bard, rogue, monk...) are purely "extras".  Even with tanks, you can go warrior, shadow knight, paladin - and they all have essentially equal tanking ability.<br />
<br />
I can't say I like it, but I can certainly understand the argument for "balancing" the healing classes.  Personally, I intend to have faith and wait to see the changes before I worry too much.  If they overdo it and we "go under" balance-wise, then at least we'll be able to expect improvements in the next patch/expansion/whatever.<br />

<br />
as a druid main/alt (she's 62) i would appreciate even just a smaller heal upgrade, all my druid ever did in exp groups (& with my husband's necro & mage friend team) was heal. i feel like Lilliah is just a level 30 cleric with a leaf blower sometimes.<br />
<br />
i don't know about other servers, but on emarr it seems there is a HUGE lacking of clerics, good OR bad. i'm sorry but my 2k heal can't keep up with something kicking the crap out of you every 1.5 minutes in a LDoN. <br />
<br />
i'm not worried about it as a new up & coming cleric. i get asked to join LDoNs/groups a lot as main healer, people don't understand its not that i don't *want* to heal, it's just i *can't* as well as a cleric. give me a cleric, enchanter, dps to keep alive, FINE. but let the one that has the spells to DO it, keep the tank alive.</td>

At first glance, <i>if</i> this goes live, it won't be as bad a thing as you think.  Most druids and shamen don't <i>want</i> to be main healers, and are most often tapped only if a cleric isn't available.  This will simply allow a shaman to fill in (somewhat) for a cleric if they aren't available.  Trust me, <i>most</i> people are still going to want a cleric as their main healer.<br />
<br />
There's another thing we bring to a group that druids and shamen don't have - rezzes.  If things "go South," then you will always have a cleric there to bring back some of that hard-earned XP.  This was brought home when I saw someone 2-boxing a cleric and BST, PLing in Paludal.  I asked him why he wasn't using a druid, since they have spells that are a little better suited to PLing (IMO).  He said that this way if things went bad, he had a rez on-hand.<br />
<br />
So, try and look at this in as objective a manner as you can.</font></td>

<br />
What does make me whine when the other priest classes are tweeked once again is, when are clerics going to get something <i>fun?</i>.  Both druids and shamen are so well-rounded, and clerics are still essentially one-dimensional.  I feel like Sony inadvertantly created an over-powered class years ago and have been scrambling ever since to balance us.  It's unfair that we're so necessary to many group situations yes, but on the other hand, clerics are totally dependent on groups!  We can't solo effectively after say, level 10, and have very little variety in our spellbook.  As druids and shaman keep becoming more and more well-rounded, clerics remain as limited as ever.  (This fabled pet I've heard about is still unknown to me as I'm only level 47).</td>

(acturally i have been in groups with one of my characters that the paly was the MT and healer.) but druids and shamans getting better heal i think is great. also clerics still have res, best ac/hp buffs, and plate armor. now give a cleric a manastone and that would be great. i like my shaman cuz when i'm oom i just eat myself. good thing that they can cuz it seems i run outta mana fast with mine. anywho, i think its good. hmm...the other window that was loading the link is finally done and read it. just improved heal over time? blah. shaman need better instant heals!</td>

The clerics can do the main healing with CH rotation (ack...hate that) and targetting specific cgaracters but we need as many underhealers as possible doing the healing of all the other tanks/DPS classes that are taking AE or aggro damage. Often we might have 6-8 65 clerics on a raid of 50-60 and we are still unable to keep the MA's alive... let alone all the others in the raid... especially ourselves. I find now that I have to join the MGB heal rotation as well things are getting so tough (but fun).<br />
<br />
It would be nice to have something else added to our armoury as compensation, but when I do LDoN adventures I find I am tanking/pacifying/rooting/pulling/nuking as well depending on how things are going. We are no way one dimensional...we just have to use all our skills and abilities to the utmost.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Shamans need more to do on raids, plain and simple. And clerics in theory should only represent about 1/15 of the population, when in practice we need them to be nearly 1/6. It would be a slight shame to see shamans have stronger healing over time, but they need to have something, so I'm willing to concede it, since that's the type of heal they seem to like to use most anyway.<br />
<br />
Most shamans cannot keep a group alive by themself. Shamans in GoD definitely can't unless your group's gear is outrageous. If a druid hasn't replaced us as healer for the group, a shaman certainly won't. Yes, they can slow too, but if they try to do both, they're gonna die...and then they need a rez.<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about being reduced to a rezbot though. It'll take far more than an upgraded heal over time, unless its ridiculous. (Heal over time was the only thing I noticed in those links at a quick glance.) Other classes revel in their versatility, while we revel in our specialization. Jack-of-all-trades, but master-of-none, is only helpful when those trades are at least mildly effective. Some shamans don't even bother trying to back-up heal as it is.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hmm..<br />
I'll admit, at first rumors of Shammies getting better heals made me nervous, and a little bit jealous. I pictured being nothing more than a rez bot.<br />
But I do not have the slightest clue how to play a Shaman, so I looked at their spellsets. Turns out they don't get Superior Healing (direct heal for 583 HP) until level 51, we get it at 34. And as far as I can see, they don't get any more direct heals after that, just regen and HoTs. Oof, no wonder there are some Shamen out there that are hesitant to perform backup healer duties-I would be too if that were the case.<br />
<br />
I have been checking out zones in PoP, and some of them are out of reach for me without a backup healer. When I'm in the middle of a CH and the rest of my party needs heals/gets summoned etc, I don't care what spells my backup healer is using, I only hope that they have my back. Improved healing spells would help the Shaman to do this effectively.<br />
<br />
If better heal spells would help them backup heal with confidence, I say go for it. I have faith that as clerics, this will still be our specialty. We simply have a better selection of tools and can heal for more HP faster and with less mana. This is why we are wanted. I have faith that the Devs will continue to let us uphold our role.<br />

(I would, however, like to have the spell Invisibility as compensation. Riiiiight ;) )</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Our main guild shammy has been depressed for a long time. He has claimed that his toon is underpowered and unwanted even with more than 300 wisdom and 100+ aa. Let him have the stronger heal - I need back up.  With us trying to do hard LDONs - it takes all of my mana to keep a tank with less than 8k hp standing. I need the help....<br />
<br />
As far as us not having fun stuff to do well how about these: we have the option to melee our little hearts out with the shiny level 56, 60,63  hammer Sony gave us. While we will never be MT or outdamge melee, we can still whack something around with yalup on if we get too bored.<br />
<br />
Think of fun with undead. Dots on them sure are fun stacked with our hammer-dot and mark of kings and mark of retribution.. Speaking of which, ever try pling a group of 30's with these? Just aggro 10 or so mobs in DSP, put a heal over time on your self and marks on all of the mobs and watch the newbies pick em off. Fun for the whole family.</td>

I just dinged 40 and things look extremely grim on the healing front.  Sure, shaman are more versatile with haste, slows, dots, buffs, etc. but clerics are hands-down the best at what we do... period... no argument.  That is something that very few classes in EQ can say.  That is not something that I see changing without some quite drastic changes to the game.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I for one am not worried about losing our place as the main healers.  Trial 7+ in GoD I needed the help healing.  Now I have Holy Light so that helps but the extra healing from either a druid or shammy is almost essential, and the tanks I was with had 11k-13k hps.  Those mobs hit hard and fast (though they don't seem to have as many hps as other expansions).  So don't worry, just welcome the backup healing.  Sure in LDoN normals or some exp groups, they can fill a cleric role except rezzes, but I would venture to say most druids/shammys would much rather do other things than be the main healer.  Besides, if I don't have to heal as much, I can nuke or melee...or chat ;)</td>
