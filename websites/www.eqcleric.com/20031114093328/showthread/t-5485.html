<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, the update for LDoN didnt finish until 11:00 PM last night for me (Central European Time) and I didnt have time to do any of the adventures, but after logging on this morning i managed to nag a group with a monk, 2 chanters, a beastlord, myself, and a bard. We signed up for the Mistmore Catacombs adventure and off we went. First impressions of the dungeon were "Awesome graphics!" the mistmore catacombs were very nicely textured and the adventure part was a nice change from your average "Pull Mob, Kill Mob, Get XP" we were constantly faced by new challenges of traps, trying to pull only 1 mob at a time, and trying to find our way around. We did manage to get lost and go around in a circle which set off a trap that poisoned me, hehe.. Because we were lost for about 10 minutes, we didnt get the quest done in time for any adventure points. But, nonetheless everyone still enjoyed it very much. It was a major relieve to be able to go dungeon crawling and was very exciting! I admit that this expansion was really awesome! Cant wait to try oujt some of the other dungeons! So! You folks post your first impressions.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I enjoyed my first adventure....was a "kill the named at the end" type one, and we did not have a mezzer for CC. Druid and I just ghetto mezzed (rooted) adds, and our Pacify line did wonders! I used it so our warrior could single pull most places (only had a couple times with adds). Time was running short, and we still had a ways to go, so I just pacified and we scooted past many mobs toward the end without having to kill them, which allowed us to get to the named and kill him in time. I was congratulated for saving the mission by using Pacify, lol. Feels good to be a hero sometimes :D<br />
<br />
Got a few gem drops, but no augmentations. Experienced a "healing trap" in the form of a rocking crate. Had a few "flying blade" type traps, I think...didn't do much though. At first, I didn't like the time limit aspect....but then again, doesn't Chardok have a type of time factor, what with the fast respawn rate and all. You have to move quickly or get back-spawn, so similar in these dungeons.<br />
<br />
One negative I noticed, trying to get a group with my 46 warrior alt....not as many folks LFG in that range as there are in the 55+ crowd, so spent over an hour waiting to fill a group, then had to leave for other commitments :(</td>

We had a few augmentations drop as well as some nice items where I won the role on a shoulder item. It felt great to be on your own in the dungeon like some sort of VIP zone;). I too feel the timer might ruin the "crawl" effect as we ended up racing near the end of our first adventure. We had been lingering around looking at stuff and got off track.

We finished one mission late and got 4 points for it, the other we failed completely due to an LD and an over zealous Druid who couldn't resist running into the named's room and then bringing everything there back to us (our timer had expired, but we were hoping to finish it late and still get some points).

But if you have ballanced force you could do 2 at once. Also love how you can be in a dungeon and not get trained. :) All around the expansion so far rocks. Oh and to get out just go back the way you came yeah its easy to get lost in some of the dungeon setups but most the time after you win there is not much up.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I thought this was a superb addition to the game. It rewards players that can think on their feet and gets away with the dreary sit and pull mentality. As a cleric, you are gonna have to learn (although I suspect that most here know how to play their class well based on posts I have read) how to be extremeley versatile, doing healing, pulling , pacifying, tanking, curing, rooting etc. It has been a long time since I have had to change the spells I have memmed so often to keep up wuth the challenge. <br />
<br />
The timed aspect is great as well as it adds that little edge.<br />
<br />
I will add one other thing. The holy trinity which was looking extremely shaky before anyway is now dead. Clerics have to be the most required class for a group now in the game. Try doing the dungeons without one, and unless you have an extremely powerful group you are going to have a lot of trouble.<br />
<br />
I was joining a raid (before we realised you needed 2 successful missions each) and while just sitting there was contiunually spammed to be asked to join groups. I normally get the ocassional one when not LFG, but this was unprecedented. I very much doubt that any clerics will ever really lack for a group again.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Just as a side note. The poison traps I ran into were to powerful to cure with pure blood in one cast. I needed antidote to cure in one cast (two casts of pure blood worked fine btw). It's however extremely possible that the traps were tailored to my level and my part in the group (most of the stuff in the dungeons apperently is). So groups with lower levels in them would probably be fine using pure blood.<br />
Also tried out the new detect curse spell. Bit strange, cause usually I would get the message "this can only be cast on the cursed." Well, very mana efficient way to find out something is not cursed, I must say. In a different dungeon I did get to cast it. Lvl 14 version of the spell gave either "not sure if its cursed", "sure it is cursed", "sure it is not cursed". Recasting on the same object after getting a "not sure" message worked as I got a "sure its cursed" message. Since I don't have the remove spell yet we decided to smack it anyway :)<br />
It's fun!</td>

We did an undead one last night. We had to collect 24 bonechips (or something) to complete the quest. We had 51 cleric (me), 51 Enchanter, 55 Shaman, 55 SK and 57 Paladin.<br />
We came so close. We were down to 4 minutes to go with 4 bonechips needed, then we decided to go all out to get the last 4....of course it went bad, chanter died and then I bought it from healing her. By the time we ressed and got ready our extra half hour was almost up, we managed to get 23 bonechips before we were booted from the zone.<br />
None of us had KEI. I think if we had KEI it would have been a cakewalk...even if just I had KEI it would have been pretty easy as I could have added DPS rather than medding.<br />
Healing was a breeze, these guys hit for about 150 to 200, but slowed easily and didnt have manay HP's. Compared to the planes I would say it was about in line with PoJ.<br />

I got me 12th AA and we were down to 1 left with 2 minutes to go...I had been chain pullin the whole time and it was great.  Since we needed 1 more item I pulled tho because we could easily handle it unfortunately they did not drop the last one :(.  SOOOOO close but yet so far away.  The next creature we killed dropped one so I got my first 4 adventure points....long way to go for group Temp at this rate.  But I found with me pullin w/pacify and such we rocked the house and we musta dropped 80 mobs in those 90 minutes.  Now chain pullin and healin and pacifyin was kinda rough on the mana (pulled with Mark of Retribution...worked wonders) but I never once needed to take an extended med brerak...when I really needed to med I pulled two and let the chanter mezed one and I medded through tell told to pull again.  This expansion rocks in my humble opinion.  Best 20-somethin bucks I have ever spent.</td>

By forced, I mean, if you want to raid with your guild, you are forced to group to get "flagged" to do so. While boxers won't really feel the pain of that, alot of people who do like to solo seem a little bitter. <br />
<br />
I like the Augmentations, and I like that you really don't have to do boring low level quests to get your spells. Haven't played with Tradeskills from LDoN yet enough to form an opinion on that aspect. <br />

I do like the fact that overall, it seems LDoN has renewed the faith and the magic of Everquest for many again. It's cool to see some of my old friends happy to play again ;)</td>

2 of them groups had people leaving 10 mins into the crawl, DESPITE great performance due to RL problem. One realized 20 mins before the end it was late and his parents wanted him OFF the comp.<br />

Group that did win however were REALLY good people. They knew how to play their classes and were in general not morons. Went extremely well.<br />

Lol my first try I had (by the end due to bad performances) to be main buffer, healer, puller and crowd controller due to the fact it seems to be either a E-bay period or the fact there are simply that many sucky people playing eq.

I ran into a similar trap this weekend.  Not sure how much damage it was doing per tic, but from characters loosing half to almost a full bub per tic, I would guess at least 400-450.  Thanks to reading this thread ahead of time, I quickly loaded Blood of Nadox, and cast.  single cast cured everyone.  the most hurt toon was at about 2 bubs of life, so it was very nasty.  Probably only 20 seconds from trap trigger to cure cast.</td>
