Loving that LDoN?<br />
<br />
Well I am...only one small problem...I can't seem to win without awesome luck.  I am currently 2-11, the rest of my guild is even worse!  Is it just that my server can not figure out how to attack these zones?  I have seen that some of you have been greatly successful in your romps through these dungeons.  I was wondering if you could impart some wisdom upon a poor unsucessful cleric and his guild of nonubers...<br />
<br />
Oh and a tack on question...How come everyone keeps saying they are getting around 50pts per adventure?  Are you doing them on hard difficulty or normal?  I only get low 20s for completing a normal adventure<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I average about 18pts for each normal adventure. This is because others in my normal group are 4 to 5 levels higher than I, so they get 21 points.<br />
<br />
Tactics? Ive found all you really need to get these adventures done are high DPS and a cleric. Of course shammy and enchanter and the rest are useful as well. Get yourself 2 good tanks, a cleric and then fill in the rest as you can.<br />
Dont muck about in the dungeon. Fully buff and med before entering. Go in and start immediately. Those that want pets can get them as soon as they enter and then begin fighting straight away, you can buff pets as you go.<br />
Dont spend time looking at things, opening chests, waking Bitten Victims, or any of that other stuff. Go in and go hard. Chain pull the whole time (hence two tanks).<br />
Also, there is no med time. You (and any other casters) really need to know how to manage your mana. if you med you will lose.<br />
<br />
Ive had 5 romps so far. I completely failed 2 (one was due to someone opening a drunk trap multiple times and we just had to sit there until we were sober again and the other one was our first romp, a party member kept LDing); I have completed one just after time ran out; and have fully completed 2.<br />
Its not a great record, but we are doing ok I think.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have had good Luck so far 3 for 3.  The points reward seems to be level based somewhat as the group that i go with have been getting a point or 2 more than me based on being a level or 2 higher than me.  I have been getting 29 points at level 61 for the normal adventures.  Have also seen 2 augments drop on all 3 adventures so far.  The group I have been with has consisted of a Beastlord, Chanter, Necro, Tank (have had a Warrior or an SK so far as MT) and myself.  We have filled the group with a Druid, Monk, or Pally on the three attempts.<br />
<br />
We almost failed our first attempt when we set off the drunk trap.....man it was fun though :P.  Really low alcohol tolerance resulted in very low wisdom after that trap.  Lost the chanter to the second trap on that first adventure.  The time it took to rez and rebuff and let her med up made the time close.  If it wasn't for the Necro twitching to bring her mana back faster we probably would have lost.<br />
<br />
So far we have done the wholesale slaughter, gather stuff, and the rescue adventure.  I liked the rescue one the best.  Still want to try the Assassination one.<br />
<br />
I agree with the buff before and avoid med breaks if you can.  Go fast but don't rush :)  And of course remember to have fun!<br />

My favorite types are the kill the boss mob ones. If you are running late on time, you can pacify your way to the boss rather then kill everything in sight (a tactic I used today).<br />
You need casters with mind buffs and lots of DPS. Crowd control helps. My preferred group for Mistmore for example is me, monk hubby, Pally for tank, Wizzy/druid, enchanter and one other DPS. As was stated above, keep the pulls commin. Don't sit to med :(  And especially in undead zones (MM is YUMMY) get out that cleric hammer and add to the DPS! Yaulp to keep up mana and proc more. I also suggest downloading the maps at    <a href="http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/" target="_blank">http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/</a><br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">most of the key tactics already pointed out:<br />
<br />
1. fully buff and med before going in. you have 30 min to get inside, use that time to buff and med to full.<br />
<br />
2. save and chests, coffins, barels till after you win.<br />
<br />
3. chain pull is a must.<br />
<br />
4. i have found the easy adventure is kill set number of mobs followed by colection (altho have heard others think colection is hardest)<br />
<br />
and dps is key. altho did a guild group yesterday, two pallys and two clerics an enchanter and a shaman. and we owned it, enchanter would only mez if had 3 or more in camp, otherwise were killing two mobs at once the entire time. from the BB camp, most of the mobs are undead, so pallys and clerics shine.<br />
<br />
you CANNOT sit and pull mobs to camp, each room have the puller pull the first two, then move into the room and kill the rest, it will take too long to split them all. i think this is the problem people have with running out of time, too much time spent in BoT or other camps pulling to camp. you have to goto the mobs as much as possible.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'm presently at 16 wins for 17 attempts.  Failed one collection despite practically clearing the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore seems easiest theme, hardest is probably Takish'Hiz.  Easiest mission types are kill XX critters and Assassination; with Assassination, you just have to kill enough critters to get the boss to spawn, then pacify your way past all of the mobs in between you and the boss.  Can be completed in under an hour from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Collection is streaky.  Mostly it's easy but if you get unlucky with the RNG, you can lose no matter how good you are.<br />
<br />
Rescue is supposedly a pain in the neck in Deepest Guk, because that froggie you have to get out of the dungeon has the hp of a naked wizard.  I'm told it's easier in other themes because the critters you have to rescue are noticeably tougher.  I've tried to avoid rescue, in general.<br />
<br />
When forming a group, think in terms of damage output; these encounters are the Trial of Execution writ large.  Try to include mages and (in Mistmoore or Deepest Guk) necros.  Beastlords are great.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As previously stated, high DPS and constant movement. This is great as it means you have to constantly think on your feet and react.<br />
<br />
I have found that depending on group make up I will be rooting/pacifying/healing/nuking and always, always tanking. You just need to add your DPS in there especially if you use the summoned hammer against undead.<br />
<br />
I have lost 4 out of 16 so far, first one on the first night when one of members could not get it for some reason...so we were 5 doing a 6 missions a tank down, next two losses were down to poor skills by players...you have to be versatile and able to react quickly...if you can't...you die, and final loss was a collect mission where we almost cleared the dungeon and still didn't get the drops...just luck. we even went the extra 30mins and still only managed 20 out of 24...poor luck imho.<br />
<br />
TBH if the group has high dps and you work well together it should be a doddle on most missions. Best one so far was a kill mission in 35 minutes....usually the missions take an hour.<br />
<br />
Oh yes...don't touch the chests till the end.<br />
<br />
The wounded critturs are worth touching if you have a good group as you get pets, mana boosts and if they are 'traps' more things that count to a kill or drop collect 8-).</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've done 8 so far.  Here's some of the group combo's we've found to be good.<br />
<br />
Wife plays with me so if I'm playing my cleric(36) she's playing her warrior(41).  Sometimes our RL friend plays and he's a bard.  He usually adds alot of flexibility to our group.  So usually I'll try to first add some DPS in the form of ROG, MNK, or BST. (rogue preferrable)  After that I'm looking for Chanter for added clarity or SK for skele pulls.  (we had a SK do pet pulls in miraguls.   Almost always got a single pull out of it, I'd throw a Celetial on the pet when he got back to camp so when we were done he could pull again right away.  It worked amazingly well).  Lastly I try to get a druid or Shaman.  Having an healer that also can do slows, snare, evac, nuke while also being able to backup heal for me led to alot less downtime.  I've also subbed Wizards in my DPS slot but because they rely on mana that's just one more person who can go OOM and also I've run into more than one that doesn't understand they're not a tank and don't need to enter a room first or just plain and simple doesn't understand that they don't have to nuke the mob as soon as you see their eyebrows coming up over the hill.  So I try to keep wizzys in the party to only those I actually know and trust.<br />
<br />
Other classes come and go.  I never turn down when I'm starting a group but that's what I've found to be the most efficient combo that works for me.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I am a lvl 65 cleric. At present I have passed 9 ldon adventures and failed the first 4 while still getting 13 points for the failures. At lvl 65 group classes is not a big issue. I have passed with 3 lvl 65 pallys a shammy myself and a wiz with 40 min still remaining on the timer. The key is constant movement and good dps. Most of my raids have been in MM dungeon and there is little time to sit without agroing so i melee a lot for dps and use yaulp 6 with kei or VOQ. Most adventures i finish with 80+ mana and LR 5 helps whenh i am agroed so i can heal self till another agroes mob off me. Do not open any chest until mission is completed you will have 30min for any after that and any spell from trunk will not affect your fighting cause it is over lol. Mt only issue has been is other healing classes do not realize that keeping cleric alive in MM dungeon is crucial. If another dies i can rez during fight and lose little or no time pushing on after kill. If cleric dies makes it a bit harder not rezzing cleric and dealing with loss of mind buffs to help support others.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My shadowknight main had a couple early bad runs but four successes in a row. I haven't been so lucky, but although the group can definitely fail because of the lack of a good cleric, the group cannot absolutely win because of one. <br />
<br />
The keys seem to be:<br />
<br />
- a fast, steady puller who keeps the mobs coming<br />
- good DPS (I like a rogue as a secondary melee because of high DPS and the ability to disarm traps).<br />
- alternative forms of mana management to keep the cleric and casters as full up as possible (necromancers, beastlords, mages for mod rods -- necros being my personal favorite) to avoid downtime<br />
- a slower<br />
- a good method for crowd control (mezzing or pacify splitting) -- adds beat down the melees and healing that much eats a lot of mana<br />
- keeping your eye on the goal (don't get distracted with any mobs that won't aggro, leave chests and such alone til the end)<br />
- MAPS (maps.eq-toolbox.com) in the LoY map system to direct you in the right direction so you aren't wasting a lot of time clearing side rooms. Not necessary -- you can get the key ratios while staying on a direct course. Wait to clear side rooms or kill named mobs until after the adventure is completed.<br />
<br />
When I am acting as puller with my shadowknight, I don't waste time with mana checks. I tell and expect the casters to tell me if they are low on mana and need a break, but otherwise I assume they are managing their own mana. <br />
<br />
It is going to take some time for pullers to learn how to pull a dungeon because it is different from pulling other areas. With other areas, pullers mostly have time to study the lines and make sure everyone is ready for a pull. With a dungeon, you don't have time to waste. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">One thing with rezzes... I have found that binding (if class is able) outside the dungeon is MUCH better than rezzing the character back in.  You come in full health, and full mana, the way to your corpse SHOULD be clear, unless someone makes a wrong turn.  Not having to wait for someone to get over rezz effects and med mana back is a big time saver, and the adventures are all about efficiency.  Doing the most damage the quickest, while useing the least mana or taking the least damage.<br />
<br />
Clerics are NOT required for any of the dungeons I have been in yet, tho they ARE always desired.   I have yet to see a LDoN capable cleric /LFG for more than a few minutes, and I have jumped some with invites within seconds of them showing up on the /lfg list.  That said, I HAVE successfully completed adventures where I (63 shaman) was slower AND main healer.  Not easy, but was great fun.  Most un-stopable group I have been in had a bard puller and CCer, me as slower dotter, pet tanker, and nuker, as well as buffer, and a druid as main healer.finished a rescue in MM with almost 30 minutes left.<br />
<br />
A big part of success, is selecting a dungeon that suits the group.  Cleric/Pally/necro/SK heavy groups have the advantage in the undead dungeons.  Look at your group before deciding where to adventure.<br />
<br />
Last advice, make sure everyone in the group has the time available to complete the adventure.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Here's a strategy that I use, that I've found works well for me.  Keep in mind, I'm level 58 (not very high level), and am using all the spells available to me at this time.  I imagine things will probably be very different as I get higher, but for now this is working well. :)<br />
<br />
First off, everything everyone said about buffing before you zone in, and no one zoning in until everyone is ready is true.<br />
<br />
But more from a strategy standpoint, during combat, this is how I do things.  There's not a lot of med time in LDoN, at least not if you want to finish the mission in time, so you've got to find alternatives to medding.  Make sure you have KEI, either from a chanter in the group, or from someone in PoK.  Always make sure you have Blessed Armor of the Risen (or it's upgrade) on.<br />
<br />
As soon as the puller comes in, let the MT take aggro then hit the puller with a Cel heal (provided your puller is not your tank, this actually works better if your puller is your tank), and then wade into combat, by the time the tank is around 80%hps you should be FoM, hit the tank with a cel heal.  The mob should be dead, or nearly dead by the time the cel heal wears off leaving your tank at or nearly at 100% hps.  While you're fighting, keep Yaulping, it's a nice mana regen while standing, and will quickly fill the little mana you lose from cel healing often.  This allows you to keep fighting (adding dps) and not run low on mana.  You'll be standing pretty much the whole time, so you can also avoid sit aggro.<br />
<br />
I've been using the strategy with great success.  Last night we did a rescue in MM, the group was me, Pally, Monk, Necro, Chanter, Beast (level range was 54 (monk) to 61 (paladin), we finished the mission with 20 minutes left, and I never dropped below 80m.  It's great with lots of DPS, but I've found this strategy works well even if you don't have lots of dps.  I was grouped with me,  Warrior, Druid, and chanter and it worked just as well.<br />
<br />
The thing to remember is to keep yaulping, keep your mana regen buffs up, and keep cel healing the tank at around 80% hps.<br />
<br />
Of course this is all provided your tank is keeping aggro and other members of the group are not getting slammed.  I've found though that most folks around this level know how to play their classes fairly well and aside from the occasional aggro draw from a slower/tasher, things are fine.<br />
<br />
Give it a shot and let me know if it works as well for you as it has for me. :)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Great strat Merrybrook! I've been using that tactic somewhat but not to the degree as you explained. With your post you insured confidence in me and it worked out great last night! I was practically FM the whole time (at least until someone spawned 5+ mobs near the end...).<br />
<br />
I think something important to note here is Yaulp V's mana regen. You'll find yourself on the move constantly not being able to sit and med, and there are many times sitting will earn you the mobs full attention:)! What better way to compensate for lack of being able to med? Whether you're fighting or just running to a new location, be sure Yaulp V (or VI) is up to make the most out of your available mana regen. Mana regen/conservation/management in LDoN is critical.</td>

<br />
This is particularly comforting to me because yesterday I was in a pickup group in LDoN that quickly went  sour -- there were a couple of brain-dead individuals in my party that ended up getting the entire party wiped. Unrelated to this was the fact that the ranger in the party started yelling at me almost immediately -- "WTF IS THIS WITH ALL THE CRAPPY LITTLE HEALS?" and "dont you know how to cheal?" and trash like that. Mind you, he was remaining vertical and I wasn't letting his hit points drop below 75%. <br />
<br />
I started trying to explain to him that cheals are big aggro, my mana level was good, etc etc etc, but ended up not saying another word.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, I was never so glad to get wiped in my life. It gave me an excuse to get out of that screwed-up party.<br />

Make sure everyone has a fresh V/K Symbol.  Throw in a group heal (Ethereal Elixir) every now and then and you will have the mana for the dps. Use AA -Radiant Cure( I have RC2) and Word of Replenishment (may have to throw this one a couple times) for dots. I also Have the AA- Celestial Regeneration(working on Celestial Renewal) for manaless HoT (Heal over Time) group heal.  I use Supernal Light for my in between heals. <br />

For MM missions I have memed: Divine Aura, Supernal Light, Word of Replenishment, Comdemnation(for the undead), Sermon of Penitence(undead dot), destroy Undead, Pet, root.<br />
