<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I recently had the misfortune of having to camp Ragefire in SolB,  during my 53hr vigil,I ws trained about 5times by clerics that were trying to steal my camp.  Unfortunately one of these clerics was able to KS me while I ws healing my monk who was killing the LDCs he trained to me.  Many thoughts flew through my mind at that time like keeping watch on his guild to see when they were in skyfire and training the whole zone to them while they were busy with Rage... Luckily for him I had the next 23 hrs to talk myself out of that by telling myself despite what an evil little IMP that guy is, he will be doing someone a world of good with that little clicky stick.  I just want to remind everyone that we ALL worked very hard to get to where we are, and you may not want to wait in some line to have to turn in a piece for your epic, but niether did the rest of us, and we certainly didnt want to sit there for an extra 24 hours because you are too greedy to wait your turn.  But what goes around comes around, one day it will be you that ws trained in CT and I am the only one around that can rez you.....</td>

got a funny story about that tho.<br />
<br />
one time in DL i wanted a gg or tl somewhere, was having no luck, then a see what looks to be a wiz standing on top of that fallen piller behind N ruins but next to the KC wall, well since i was kind of in a hurry to get a ride i sent him a tell ( i never send tells asking for rides, well almost never, we all know what is like getting tells) asking if he could please TL me to wherever i was going, he said nope.. busy ( i had watched him for awile before i sent the tell, and i had also saw his /ooc wiz lfg). then few min later i saw a /ooc wiz to such and such ruins. well eventualy i got a ride. you can see how this would up set someone.. well it did me. the VERY next night, i log on and am sitting at north wall medding up after buffing my self getting ready to lfg, when who comes running up dragging his corpse, oh my god i almost splilled my drink. he sends tell "rez please". i send one back... nope busy.  then i /ooc cleric lfg ;-)<br />
<br />
but no.. i have no do not rez list. i figure if you piss me off bad enough, i will remember your name!<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Agreed. I once started with the intention of keeping a rez list. Being the geek I am I had a nicely made table on a piece of paper to fill in the meanie's name and a reason why I wouldn't rez him.<br />
<br />
I swear I have that paper somewhere...and I guess that's the reason that idea never went anywhere... :)<br />
<br />
But... I tell you this. Those players who cross me the worst, they leave a mark. I don't forget their names. Granted not many people have managed to get to me in such a way, and my ignore list is currently empty.<br />
<br />
However I figure the ignore list is also a perfect in-game DNR (Do Not Ressusitate) list. In fact...it works perfectly well, since that person won't even get to bug you :)<br />
<br />
Now wouldn't it be nice if Verant made a little way of adding people to a DNR list and down the road when the incident is long forgotten and the person come begging for a rez...you have forgotten and you cast your spell, only to have it stopped by a feature telling you this person is on your DNR list, and a short reason (entered in vain by yourself when person magically entered the list) why that person will only get a /rude.<br />
<br />
Now that is taking it a bit far...yes. But I be damned if some smuck from last summer who caused enough trouble to get my attention, AND be remembered, shall get to enjoy my restoring services.<br />
<br />
I tell you this... Rez is our most powerful tool. Would you really go up to a lvl 60 enc and piss him off with such a passion that you could just put him on your "don't even ask" list? Don't think so...There's no point, cause it's just a game and some day you might need his or her help...and the old episode won't matter anymore...to you, but might to the enchanter. :)</td>

This is not a new concept, people.  It's called disliking someone, and it is not something reserved for clerics.  Personally, I think the whole idea is ridiculous, seeing as how clerics are one of the most -- if not THE most -- co-dependent classes out there.  Every time you log on, you are going to need something from someone, and chances are, if you piss them off, you are going to end up paying the price for your bitterness more than the person on your "no rez" list.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I agree partially with this guy, there are going to be all sorts of classes that bring a bad name to the class. Dr00ds, W33zards, Sha-dr00ds ( shamans in full wis gear, no hp/ac ), Training Munkeys and SK's etc. Each class has them folks. You run up to druid sitting in DL and kindly ask for a sow.....no response.....he stands up and gates....alright buddy.../ignore....There it's fixed....People can always find a ride or sow, but can you always find a rez? Clerics are not as co-dependent as people think. I myself and others were soloing in DL's when we couldn't get a group. Retribution, Root..Retribution..Root..Med...Repeat<br />
<br />
There's two types of people that live in dungeons and you will get a reputation, good or bad, if you stay in one long enough.<br />
<br />
A) You know what you're doing and people will make pains to get you into their group. Folks hail you when you go lfg. <br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
B) You're such a pain in the ass that folks will actually leave groups when you join so that they don't have to listen to your BS and about get killed by you. People start gating out so theres not a remote risk they can be killed by a train you intentionally or unintentionally cause.<br />
<br />
Each class has them folks, we all know it, we've all had to endure it. Best thing we can do is to shrug it off and just remember, healing kills an monk sk or nec thats intentionally trying to steal your camp. The rest, well the rest, we just got to pray that we don't cross their path again.<br />

While still having rez effects and practicly no health the clerics group trained something to ehr area and poof she died again. The cleric ran off without even offering an apology or a rez.

I would hope at this lvl that you wouldnt need to rely on the services of one particular person that you decided you didn't like.  By now you should have at least a group of friends if not a guild that you could get help from.  And as far as clerics being the most co-dependant class out there, we are also one of the most needed classes, and if we are shun by one person or group, it's no matter because we WILL get another.  So if some guy trains me and I decide I won't rez him anymore, is it really going to hurt me in the longrun?-I seriously doubt it.  If my whole gameplaying experience was able to be ruined by one single player, then i should have put this game away a long time ago.</td>

You have these pretentious lists, and you cackle like dweebs while you scribble down names of people who <b>wronged</b> you, in hopes that you can "<i>pay them back</i>" by denying them resurrections in the future.  So, instead of realizing that, like you, these people have friends and most likely will never need your help, you choose to dwell on it.  Hell, you go so far as to drag it into your real life, and keep a notebook where you log the person's name and a reason why you won't help them?<br />

I suppose if it softens the blow of whatever they have done to you, more power to you.  I'm just trying to point out how stupid you all sound.</td>

As for dwelling on them or their crime, put them on ignore and forget about them, no need to keep a paper list, ignore works just fine.<br />
Clerics aren't as dependent as people think. Some of the clerics here including myself solo just fine or do well in groups also.<br />
