<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello,<br />
<br />
My name is Alyaa, I am a 60 cleric on the Emarr server.  The last time I looked at eqcleric it was completely different.  This is also my first time to post.  I don't want to start a rant or a bunch of argueing I just want some opinions.  :) <br />
<br />
I have been camping Ragefire since January of this year.  I have not gotten him yet of course.  I have put in my fair share of sitting there endless hours and nothing to show for it.  I think moving Ragefire to Skyfire Mountians was the worst thing VI could have done to a cleric.  I have yet to meet anyone who disagrees.  I helped 2 friends to camp him in SolB so I do know what that camp was like.  I have a few ideas on how they should change his spawn.  Well first off I have heard rumor they are going to change it but no clue what is going on with that.  <br />
<br />
My first idea is to change him back to the SolB camp and a triggered spawn, or if they want just make him a triggered spawn in SF and keep spawn time the same as it was before.<br />
<br />
My second idea is to make his spawn time every three days and not nerf his drop.<br />
<br />
My third idea is to put him in a harder to get to zone, after all look at what other epic mobs are in the planes. <br />
<br />
 VI says this is a very important epic and high end game then why not make it that way.  Of course it isn't fair for people with smaller guilds or no guilds but it would keep people from fighting.  VI thinks he made this more of a challange for us when all he did was to turn people agianst each other.  I read people's post saying first there and first to engage with the force gets him.  But what about when one person is camping him 3 days then another shows up to kill him the day he spawns on an hour before he is due?  It is completely unfair.  I don't know about your servers but on Emarr no one respects this camp like they did on SolB camp.  I have been ganked 3 times and I have seen other clerics ganked.  If I am camping him and someone shows up I tell them in a very nice manner that I was there first only to get a rude response of uncareing. Does anyone else have this problem?  I feel for any cleric that is after him and any cleric that will be.  I know a lot about the spawn if anyone needs to know anything.  And I know a GM will not double pop Ragefire if two guilds are there unless you are very lucky to have the GM in a good mood.  But to end, please let me know what you think and how the camp is going, or how it has been for you.  I would love some imput.  Otherwise good journeys in game.  :) <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The whole cleric epic is the biggest crock of crap VI has come up with. I think the quest designer was just getting over a divorce or something and his wife played a cleric. It's not just Ragefire that blows. There are 2 other camps along the way which are huge time sinks as well.<br />
<br />
However, Ragefire is the epitome of what not to do for an epic quest mob. You have a random spawn on a long timer in a zone that wizards and druids can both port to. You have a highly sought after epic item and even though there are time sinks involved beforhand, Ragefire's spawn time is so long its not enough to keep everyone from getting bottlenecked at the ragefire spawn. So the end result is you have anywhere from 2-5 clerics from different guilds all waiting on the same mob.<br />
<br />
This has created an environment of stiff competition for Ragefire. Whenever you have this type of environment, the worst in people tends to come out. It seems that most of the time Ragefire is dropped a GM has to be called in to clean up the mess. However the GM rarely does anything so it's too the point now where if you want your cleric to have his or her epic, you've got be willing to throw the rules of the PnP (play nice policy) out the window. This is the one camp where I can't blame a guild for KSing, training, ninja-looting or whatever because the high competition and lack of GM follow through has created this disaster.<br />
<br />
Verant has repeated several times there are no plans to change the quest because they "like to control the flow of cleric epics in the game and the bottleneck does that". That is the weakest reasoning I have ever heard of. There are much better ways of doing this than what they have done. Have the pearl you turn into Zordac be a very rare drop off a common mob somewhere. Say it will drop randomly off a wurm in skyfire or something at a rate of 1 out of 500 or something. That way several clerics can be camping the same piece but without the cutthroat competition. The rarity of the item will get rid of the mess around the Ragefire camp.<br />
<br />
Oh well, that got too long but the bottom line is the Ragefire camp is bad for the cleric, bad for the cleric's friends and guild, and bad for the GM's and Verant.</td>

<br />
We have some higher end guilds that refused to follow the list and for about 8 months...that had not been a problem.  We had a cleric camping the spawn as it was his time on the list...he had been there 6 days...long boring days...camping...when RF popped...he sent out the call for help when one of the bigger non complying with the list came in and sniped RF from him....What a mess...<br />
<br />
The guild that did it has now worked out a deal with the list makers...which I hope will work out...btw...I'm 27th on the list...woot...27 more weeks and I will have my epic...unless sniped again...hehe<br />
<br />
Anyway....something needs to be done with RF....an epic shouldn't cause so much discontent within a server...:(<br />

Hopefully, VI will take note and help us poor clerics...<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ok I found the new info on RF even tho most of you have already.  There is now a human female NPC in SF where RF spawns.  You have to get the box from her after you hail her and collect 4 shards to put into the box and hit combine.  Then you turn the box into her and she spawns RF.  She is a 30 mintue spawn and will not talk to you if you haven't completed the SolB turn in.  The shards are rare but not uber rare, a cleric in my guild got two in only a matter of hours.<br />
<br />
So good luck guys! Let me know how things turn out.  :)<br />

Say it will drop randomly off a wurm in skyfire or something at a rate of 1 out of 500 or something. That way several clerics can be camping the same piece but without the cutthroat competition. The rarity of the item will get rid of the mess around the Ragefire camp.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hey guys,<br />
     I have needed RF for about a year.  I am very happy that he is a trigger spawn.  I will gladly take the time to do the trigger "quest" i guess i can call it.  It's only 4 more items to get, no matter how rare they are.  I would just like to say that its about time varent did this.  There are several clerics that needed this.  Good Luck!<br />
