<br />
My question is do you guys charge for it?  I was in a group with my pally the other day.  We were in KC and the warrior asks the cleric for a temp.  He had put the other 2 buffs on both the warrior and myself but no symbol on either of us.  We all knew he had it because while the group was forming outside he was hawking his wares in OOC across the zone.  Anyways, he told the warrior he would temp him if he paid 20plat.  Being a cleric of no great level I was a bit taken by that.  I would assume he would make that back in the group over the course of time.  I look at it as being the clerics job in the party.  Buff and Heal are #1.  I can understand charging in POK if that is how you want to spend your game time, but not in a group.<br />
<br />
What is your take on this?</td>

However, even with exp groups where no loot was involved I still slapped HP buffs on everyone regardless. I too consider it part of being a cleric's job. If I play a melee alt, though, I carry a few stacks of dots on my and offer one each time I ask for a buff.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I never charge for it, but I also never have a problem getting a fair split of the loot. Yes, it means I make less than the others in the end, but I don't care...I always group with Guildies and Alliance types, so I have no problems taking the hit for them.<br />
<br />
Of course, I also have no trouble making money. If I was constantly broke, I'd probably ask to get dot costs covered. As it is, these are the people that made sure I had my Epic as quickly as we could get it, and who will cheerfully camp anything I need camped. Even if I wasn't getting any loot, they would get everything I had to offer them. (Any peris that drop <i>do</i> automatically get handed to me, though. I never asked for that, they just do it because the cleric and enchanter should <i>always</i> get the peris)<br />
<br />
As it is, I think I have blown through three stacks since Saturday just doing drive by Tempings on the people in OT and M Seru, where I have been leveling my enchantress.<br />
<br />
If I somehow found myself in a pick up group <shudder> I'd be a lot more likey to request getting at least partial coverage if loot was going to suck. Then again, money really isn't an issue for me, so probably not.<br />
<br />
If you are a broke cleric, though, I don't see a problem with getting costs covered in pick up groups. (Still not 20pp, though. You are getting XP, you shouldn't be looking to make a profit)</td>

I never charge them for it.  I think I have been fortunate in that all the LDoN groups I have been in have seen fit to give me any peridots that drop.  Many people offer me extra cash at the end but I don't accept it unless they insist.  I also don't hesitate to slap a Death Pact on the enchanter for good measure.  I usually break even or come out a little ahead with the loot gained.  That's a fair deal for me.</td>

No good HP buffs for anyone... Most of the time there are a few melees out there that carry dots and reimburse, and some casters as well... The guild also makes an effort to reimburse, or to at least make sure I get a share of whatever treasure may drop. Not all groups are so caring about whether the cleric gets a share of loots or not, though. Especially when looting is FFA, all caster types have a hard time getting a chance to loot.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I deal with Dot costs differently depending on who I am grouped with:<br />
<br />
Guild & Pickup group regulars: Temp if they need it no worries about the dot. Most are usually pretty good about throwing something extra my way to cover the costs but I don't sweat it. <br />
<br />
Unknown Pickup groups: I ask for dot donations or an extra vendor item to cover the costs up front. I still buff, whether I get cost/dots. Most folks recognize the extra costs involved and have no problem helping a cleric out.<br />
<br />
Buffing: I buff for a minimum donation of 11p or a dot. If I didn't, I might as well stand on a corner in PoK and 11p to everyone that walks by.  If folks feel like donating more, great, I appreciate the extra plat.<br />
<br />
I disagree with the whole "cost of business" ideology. Why should a cleric be expected to eat 50p right off the bat when they group simply because they have buffs. I could see the point if the buffs only benifited the cleric but everyone gets an edge from the HP/AC buffs.</td>

So i request everyone what wants temperance, to cough up a peridot or pay me at least 13pp.<br />
And the reason i just don't give it out for free in pickup groups (though i happily buff guildies) is because most is FFA, and i med my ass off and most tanks just loot soon after fight anyways, so i wouldn't make it unless i was standing close to mob when it died.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I also view buffing as part of the clerics job, however if someone does ask for a buff requiring a dot who is outside the group i do like to ask for a donation to help cover the costs.  Most of the guys are pretty good and will give a donation of about 12pp which is what dots cost me in PoK.<br />
<br />
But 20pp that i think is just price gouging.<br />
<br />
As for on raids, my group always seems to cover the dots for me 8D so i usually dont care much about the loot.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As a lvl 65 cleric I always  buff my group with with HoV before we start. I noticed that in PoP, groups were pretty decent in giving the cleric the first BD or diamond loot to cover the costs of dots. However in LDoN this is different, whereas there is a ML is usually used. I have never received anything to defray the cost of reagents in LDoN with the exception of my 1/6th share of the loot. If you are a cleric I would not ask for cash for buff but know your zone and ask for a particular item that drops to defray your costs. if your are in need of cash. If you are denied you are more than welcome to disband and let the cheapos seek another cleric. <br />
