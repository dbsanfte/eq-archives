At 39 I started In DL and also got my first taste of karnors (yes some people are psycho and if they trust you will take you in at 39) DL is like every other place on your Kunark trip so far. BORING! Sometimes finding a group here is a bit difficult too. The only real way to do DL is to partner in my opinion. Faster expo that way grab a 48 warrior or monk and just cruise one of the ruins. If you want fast exp take your self up to Deep side of Echo Caverns. at 41 I was getting almost a blue per kill (just a little under) and I was soloing. The 4 underbulks at the begining are a good start remember to pull at an angle first to break the camp or it can spell your doom. I went from 41-50 in here in a little less then a week. I even got to 51 in here killing taskmaster and skellies who were still dark blue to me. Remember watch out for fireclaw (Cant be rooted) and Trillcor (nasty Stun he has).</td>

Very funnys ight as Fungal Fiends just stop in their tracks and act as though the people arent alive. By the way Im not condoning the use of bugs to further your advancement in game. I will say this though. There are plenty of times where we live with the screw ups of VI and bugs there-in (I remember paying a nice chunk of cash for 2 weeks to get ported places cause the stupid boats didn't work). So it's just my opinion that if bug gets exploited every once in awhile then life just evens itself out.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I went partnering with a ranger yesterday (we had a beasty come later) for Rockhoppers in DSP. OMFG you wouldnt believe. At level 49, I was averaging 1/5th of a blue a kill. A STINKIN KILL. We set up in the second room inside the cave and just owned. Owned owned owned. PLus, the loot is pretty decent if your into the bazaar thing. Saryrn seems to have a demand for Rockhopper hides, and about 7 Flawless dropped over the course of 2 hours. 700pp isn't bad, with insane EXP. They don't hit hard, and con blue. At 48 Retribution (Lvl 44 DD right?) was doing about a bubble of damage a pop. Fun fun stuff. Scarlet desert I didnt like...wasnt noticing much XP gain. Sol B is still good stuff if you can get a partner or go solo. Fun fun. Kael is also really good if you have a small group. We did a small raiding group (55 war, 56 pally, 48 Clr, 51 Rogue) and I was still getting some good exp. I can only imagine what it would be like With some toned down levels...(does it matter though?) Well, g'luck to you all, with my new 53 monk pet I'm doing Nobles in HK, and let me tell you. If you can find a buddy to do that, it is phnomenal. Im going to ding 50 tonight for sure (its about dang time!)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">If you've never been to Tower of Frozen Shadow, grab a partner (preferably a Ranger and a few more if you want, but definitely a Ranger if no one else...Necromancers are good to have, too).<br />
<br />
First, purchase a Dawnfire, Morningstar of Light, if you can afford one.<br />
<br />
Quick guide to getting keys (after, of course, printing a map from <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com" target="_blank">www.eqatlas.com</a>):<br />
<br />
First floor: anything spawns the undead gnoll (drops key to 2nd floor), so kill everything.  Use fear...the mobs run straight to the mirror...easy to kill, just be careful not to click the mirror.<br />
<br />
Second floor: again, kill everything.  Don't fear, just heal Ranger, nuke some.  Anything can spawn the Angry Librarian (drops key to 3rd floor).<br />
<br />
Third floor: Again, kill anything.  Spawn enraged gnoll (drops key to 4th floor).<br />
<br />
Fourth floor: This floor can be a total PAIN.  Just focus and keep going.  Anything can spawn Carmilla Omican (not sure on name, but close enough...she spawns in a coffin next to the mirror that pops you to 5th floor; she drops key, a No Drop dagger, Embalmer's Skinning Knife, and Socerous Bowl).<br />
<br />
Fifth floor: Easy solo here for a Cleric, but you'll want to move to 6th floor for easier solo.  Kill anything and spawn enraged relative (drops Beer Stained Coldain Tunic, Velium Spiked helm, key to 6th floor).  Also, some broken (or unsolved) quest items drop here, as well as some nice resist gear (off of Nosja, Damad, and Priest Majes Medory).<br />
<br />
Sixth floor: Here you can solo.  Load up Superior Healing (if below 44; if 44+, use Celestial Healing), Panic Undead, Wave of Fear (in case of adds; just use Wave, then use Panic the Dead after all mobs are feared), Yaulp (if you want), Sermon of the Righteous, Turning of the Unnatural (if you don't have this spell, it will eventually drop), Banish Undead (or your most recent undead nuke), and a stun or two.  Follow the hallway and on your first left turn, you'll see a gnoll.  Sometimes he aggroes, sometimes he doesn't.  Eventually you will learn how to *not* aggro him before you can fear.  Fear him, then follow him to the wall, and melee/nuke/DoT.  Follow the same hallway and keep pulling the gnolls and spectres.  Only grab the 2 gnolls and 2 spectres from this hallway, then move to the opposite hallway.  With KEI, I was able to do the first 2 gnolls and spectres, and then 4 more gnolls before they started respawning.<br />
<br />
After getting your keys, the trick will be getting to the spot by yourself.<br />
<br />
First floor: use IVU.<br />
<br />
Second floor: IVU.<br />
<br />
Third floor: After getting to the mirror on second floor, cast a Cloudy Potion (sells for 11pp in Thurgadin) and run through the floor.<br />
<br />
Fourth floor: There is *always* a mummy that can see invis, but everything else can't see through normal invis.  Before popping to 4th floor, cast another invis potion and just pray you don't run into the mummy.  If aggroed, cast DA quickly and keep running.  The mobs won't follow you to the next floor, but camp if you want to be extra careful.<br />
<br />
Fifth floor: use IVU.<br />
<br />
After 10 levels here, I've only ran into trouble once with the 4th floor, and I leveled FAST, with or without KEI.  I grouped and soloed through these levels, but if I had mostly soloed, I would have leveled faster.  Exp is good to level 54, but slows down considerably after 50.<br />
<br />
The whole TRICK to this spot is, sadly, the Dawnfire weapon.  If you don't have one or can't get one (it's still a decent Cleric item, regardless), I wouldn't bother hunting in this spot.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Qeynos Catacombs, or the Aquaducts, whichever you prefer, is an excellent zone to kill in from lvl 45-50 for a cleric. There are 4 spectres in the back by the Bertoxx trainers who will stay blue to you until you are 50, although at 49 a good percentage of them are light blue. Because this is indoor exp, you get a bonus. My tactic for killing them were to fear them and nuke them - pretty easy huh? They went down with 3 undead nukes and they run in the same path everytime you fear them.<br />
The zone is pretty uncrowded, too, so you won't usually have to wait for someone to leave the camp. The only bad part about it is that the repop time on the spectres is an ungodly amount, around 10-15 minutes. I went from 45-50 in a week and died maybe twice.<br />

Kill Librarian, Assistant Librarian, Teacher and then any student and scholar you can. Dont get below 40m though, cause eventually the Angry Librarian will pop out of something you kill. Loot the key and either the Student's Homework, to sell, or Teacher's Sylibis to put in your range slot. Good Wis Caster item. Then move on to 3rd floor. Try not to engage the Armored Shadows as they have a lot of hp. Just root/atone them unless you bring along a meat shield. From entrance go right to the corner, then down hall to 3rd door, root/nuke the butlers to death, then go thru that room, kill the 2 zombies chics in there and set up camp. The mirror in that room is your exit out of the tower.  Again. Try not to pull armored shadows, but kill the undead gnoll cooks, butlers, and zombies. I made levels 44/45 soloing in there. Good exp, and alot of drops that sell for 1-4pp. The angry cook drops a nice ring that sells for 100p in bazaar. Wouldnt try to go to 4th floor alone until 49 or so. but once you get passed 4th floor, 5th floor has some awsome lootz.<br />

First of all, I'm thinking that there is something wrong with me because i'm in DL right now and suddenly my exp has seemed to have gotten slow. I'm just 44. Like it is 3-5 kills per percent anymore (4% per blue). And Dawnshroud is even worse. The best xp i've gotten lately is in Jagged Pines. I've got the luxury of having a 56 ranger of a boyfriend that xp's there regularly, and we have a 60 druid on a third account. We used the druid to put greater wolf form on me (to diminish aggro) and i follow the ranger around and fear poachers after he's snared them. The only problem is you can't stay in JP long because the aggro build on you and you train all the animals in the zone to the stone as you zone out. The ranger cracks up :) <br />

All of the undead spawns are much like the triggered wolf spawns in DSP, so unwanted aggro is almost unheard of.  KEI will help reduce downtime, but I wouldn't say it's <b>necessary</b>.  It takes longer to kill these guys prior to Banish Undead, but are definitely doable.<br />
<br />
The loot isn't so great, maybe a couple pp per corpse.  People killing the guards, however, will sometimes not loot the weapons off of them.  These sell for about the same as FS weapons, so that's potentially extra income.  There's also a bank in the zone, so you don't have to worry about getting overloaded with coins.</td>

I've spent a little time with some friends, in the Grey. I was just there tagging along for moral support. I got brave and started nuking a skelly with my uber undead spells. Went thru them like butter, so this can be a good spot for solo XP, provided you have an EB necklace. My suggestion, make friends with people hunting there. Get 3 organs from the Shissar and get that EB necklace from Katta. Then you can wander the zone without choking to death. <br />
<br />
I just got a new uber P4 system so i can see the worms crawling underground(i'm still amazed that Verant did that!) so you can dodge em. Fun stuff. There are tons of undead strewn all over the zone and a few good camps. Just watch out for the shissar, the golems(mean stun) and the stonegrabbers. <br />
<br />
The best thing to do is head left once you zone in and park it in a corner. There are some safe places in this charnal zone.<br />
Pull to that corner, there are spots to kite so there can be room to root and shoot.<br />
<br />
Important things you'll need or need to remember:<br />
<br />
1. Be sure to bind yourself outside in ML, coming into the Grey nekkid is a painful thing.<br />
<br />
2. ALWAYS have sow potions(i'm a potion nut. SOW, invis, and Gate potions are always on me. EB potions are good too, if you don't like having an EB necklace.)<br />
<br />
3. EB Necklace. I don't like the idea of depending on my own memory or common sense to watch for the spell to fade. I'll be dead before I notice, lol. A necklace takes that worry away.<br />
<br />
4. Have Gate and Divine Barrier up at all times. OK, i'm a total <meow>. I would rather run and live, then fight and die with Valor. That's for those clowns that litter the zone with their corpses and cry for rezzes for an hour before swearing at everyone. Besides, running into The Grey all nekkid and with no EB is for the shortbus folks. You know who you are.<br />
<br />
You will get decent xp and not really have to deal with crowds. Everyone is dealing with the golems and such. I'm sure there are better xp places. But they are crowded. No one is going to fight you for a spot here. Maybe I'm just nuts, but I love this place. Besides...would you rather sit in DL and watch 15 year olds talk about their sex lives???<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Mid lvl exp zone info <br />
<br />
This is part of one of my posts from my old guilds board. Keep in mind that when I posted this I was playing my Ranger as my main which was lvl 56 at the time and my cleric was 54. I leveld my rng from lvl 30 to 51 in this zone and I leveled my cleric to 34 - 51 in this zone (dual boxing with my rng). I also solo'd my necro from level 39 to 49 in the caves there. I made 60kpp+ with my necro solo and did the Shield of Bane warding quest 6 times with my rng and cleric boxing. Selling all shields for 20-25kpp each (only the skulls drop here for the quest). They go for about 10kpp - 15kpp now. I also made probably 20kpp from other drops and vendor crap with my rng and cleric. Ok on to the post. <br />
<br />
On the topic of mid lvl exp areas I favor Tenebrous Mountains. One major reason is there are LESS PEEPS there. Two is there is great exp and great loot at the same time. I exp'd there from lvl 30ish to lvl 51. <br />
<br />
There are two zonelines you can hunt from solo ( Katta entrance and Grimling Forest zone). <br />
<br />
There are also some great quests items that drop there like Shield of Bane warding piece ( Tormented vah shir skulls is one piece ). Which is a 20ac 20wis 12svm shield. That camp is to the far left of the Katta wall and is the safest camp in the zone (no trains and no wanderers). You sit at the rock (safe spot from all spawns) with the tree ahead of you and to the left and watch for the spawns on the hill by the corner of the wall. The respawn is 3 mins and constantly spawns a lvl 35 to 40ish npc of a different variety (grol baku, darkwing bats, craig lagi etc.) as the PH (place holder) for the Tormented Vah Shir. The TVS is lvl 45ish i'd say. You can also pull from the valley below while waiting for the repop. <br />
<br />
You can also hit the Coterie outposts after i'd say lvl 45. Which are spread around the zone along the zone barrier. They are a lot harder and lifetap like crazy. <br />
<br />
Or you can take one of the two grimling caves (drop runes, acrylia, windstones and some gems). Which is between the Grimling zoneline and the Katta wall. This is where I made the all my pp while soloing my necro. Selling Acrylia and Windstones to other players in the bazaar and selling the rest of the stuff to vendors. 200 to 600pp a day of vendor crap depending on how long I was there and my necro got up to 3 levels a day there. Up to 4kpp a day in acrylia and windstones (long day. lol). <br />
<br />
The loot in this zone is great and has great exp too. In one night off random mobs you could make 300pp+. The random mobs drop acrylia and windstones and essance of the wind(use for tradeskills or sell to other players in bazaar for great price), gems of many kinds (some sell as high as 16pp each to vendors) and some pp drops too. <br />
<br />
Now for ultimate loot and some good exp you could hit the Coterie Castle (aka fort). You will need a good FULL group of lvl 47+ with a good healer and tank. You will also need a monk or necro to pull so you can split the mobs. I have hunted here quite a bit and the mobs can be harmonied so a rng could do the pulling too. Druids just don't have the hp's and ac for it I don't think. They hit hard there and lifetap hard and some DD for up to 1k-2k. The mobs also invis themselves so watch out. I've seen each member in the group get up to 2kpp worth of drops from a night's work (5+ hrs). Sometimes more. Some really good INT caster loot drops here (blood weave), A rare cloak and rare wis shield quest piece (not SoBW). Blue Diamonds and many other gems worth in the 100pp to 300pp range to vendors and some are used for quest gear and tradeskills, Coterie gear (general boots and general capes), and other misc drops that can be vendor sold for PP split to group. The castle is located to the right of the Grimling zoneline (as you enter TM) in the corner of the zone. You will pass a coterie outpost on the way there (stay far right to get by untouched). You'll know when you get there by the size of the place. Its about 20 times taller then you. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps you all. I've spent a great deal of time in this zone.</td>

I've found it to be some of the better xp for this lvl.  Only problem is its a bit out of the way, but with sow/jboots, you can get there in one piece no problem.</td>

Solo:<br />
CoM (ok loot but not great)<br />
Specs in Oasis (not bad loot)<br />
<br />
Group (exp not cash)<br />
Taskmaster in Echo (played with him last night)<br />
CoM<br />
Elysians in Umbral Plains (this depends on getting a high quality full group)<br />
<br />
Group (cash)<br />
Ships in Dulak<br />
CoM<br />
<br />
I still have not spent much time in ToFS with my cleric. I know the zone very well with my Ranger and as much as I love the zone and think its excellent exp and loot for all levels 30+, I just havent felt like going back there.<br />
Maybe Ill go back and solo there soon.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Even though its is still primarily a byogroup. Gulf of Gunthak and Dulak's harbor are much better than any kunark zone. The other day, I was in Dulak's working on the temperance quest, which I did complete. I found myself in a group of 4, which included a 60 BL. All we did was camp one of the ships and I still got a full 1% exp per kill. In DL, in a group where I am one of the highest in level, I average between a half and a third of a percentage point.<br />
<br />
I personally am not a fan of clerics soloing at these levels. If I wanted to solo, I would have chosen a different class.</td>

Dulaks is a zone off Gunthak. You run through the tunnel that is on the beach in Gunthak. If you keep to the right side of the tunnel and follow it all the way, you will come to a small town, there are 2 zonelines in this town. Keep to the right still and circle the town and you will enter a zone, this is Dulaks.<br />
There are a few good spots for hunting here. Dont stay at the zoneline too long unless your group is ready as there is at least one wanderer that comes close enough to aggro.<br />
You can fight at the zoneline (I found this is generally one of the hardest places to camp). You can camp around the corner from the zone on the left wall (another hard spot). You can do the caves (better have a good group for this) or you can do the ships.<br />
Run to the right from the zone in and you get to the harbour. There are 4 ships along here and they tend to go from easier to harder. The first ship, Storm is the best one to start on and is the easiest. 2 People can do this no problems (any 2 classes). Dont worry about aggro from mobs, as long as you stay on the boat you are pretty right, just sit near the ramp on the boat. Pulling aggro is pretty good but use Pacify just in case.<br />
<br />
Gunthak beach is great. I havent been there in a few levels, but I would guess that levels 39 to 47 could solo here and get exp (great exp). The best place to camp is on the dead side (from the lighthouse, the left side is dead side, right is live side). From the Lighthouse follow the left wall to the beach, dodge around the few spawns near the wall..about halfway up the wall you will find a lone sailor. I cant remember his name,but he is a live mob. Dont hurt him, he will be indiff to you and wont aggro at all. You can sit anywhere between him and the rocks and be fine for aggro. There are some dead spawns close by that are out of aggro from others, but if you look north there are a few tightly packed, use pacify for them. Once you get the hang of it you will find that pulling singles is very easy here.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">ALot of those places are great, but I'm surpised nobody has mentioned Nobles in HHK.  I spent 12 hours there yesterday and leveled from 40 to 44.  Yeap, in 12 hours, I got 4 levels.  It was an even 4 levels too cause I logged off the night before having just dinged 40.<br />
<br />
I was getting around 1/3 of a blue to 1/2 a blue per kill.  This is PC quality xp folks :D <br />
<br />
Bad part is the Factions:  You loose Freeport, Qeynos, and High Hold Pass factions, along with slowly loosing Knights of Truth and League of Anontican Bards.  You don't loose the last 2 very fast because there is only 1 mob that gives those faction hits.   Good part is you gain faction with Mistmoore so after a good day or two of hunting there,  you should be able to walk into MM and go to a certain camp.  You also gain faction with the Ring of Scale which can be good as well.<br />
<br />
Loot is was decent.  Some gems drop worth up to about 20pp and FS drops up the Wazzu.  I got about 500pp there in 12 hours rarely looting.  <br />
<br />
Good luck all</td>
