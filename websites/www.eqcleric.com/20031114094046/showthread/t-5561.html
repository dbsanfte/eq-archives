<br />
This is my first guild experience, and I'm not sure what the best ratios\setups are. (technically, I was in a guild briefly when I first played, but I deguilded after about 2 days...I was young and foolish, and joined one of those ever popular /OOC guilds)<br />
<br />
What do you think the right ratio is? It is a 'family' guild, but we are raiding more and more with our Alliance.<br />
<br />
At the moment, we don't worry about making sure there is an officer from each class, or assign specific areas to specific officers. That may change as well, if we grow to the point that it becomes necessary.</td>

We usually run about 10 officer 2 leaders, I made philosophy long ago, don't make officers of folks that ask.  Make officers of folks you are confident in.  <br />
<br />
The best advice is to have as many officers you are comfortable with, and make sure they can work as a cohesive team.  This does not mean they always need to agree, but that they understand the guild goals and mission. <br />

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Here is the best advice I can give on the subject:<br />
<br />
You need as many officers as you absolutely NEED.  NO MORE.  Really....<br />
<br />
Do not get weighted down with trying to figure out who gets promoted, what new officer title you need, how many officers do you need per member, how many officers do you need to have on at one time so they can argue amongst each other more effectively..etc etc..<br />
<br />
For a semi-raiding guild here is what I would suggest to cover most of the bases: <br />
<br />
1 - Guildleader (for some reason you have to have one of these <shrugs>)<br />
<br />
2 - 2'nd in command (only when the guildleader is not on does this position matter.. and it's only function is to handle IMMEDIATE problems that a GUILDLEADER should handle.. namely, disputes between your guild and another etc..  2'nd in command should have NO other authority.. all actions will be reviewed by the executive council.  (ie: this doesn't have to be a seperate office.. you could have a rule that says the 'highest ranking' officer is 2'nd in command when a real 'crisis' occurs and the GL is not able to be reached..)<br />
<br />
3 - Historian/Webmaster/Secretary/Slave - Keeps the web up to date and all the player rosters correct and contact info up to date.  Does all the 'record keeping' not associated with other offices.  Keeps notes from guildmeetings and publishes them to the web for guildmember review etc.. (you really could split this into two seperate offices if you need..  it's a ton of work for one person if you have a very active guild)<br />
<br />
4 - Treasurer - Records deposits in Guild Bank and disbursements from bank.  Not associated with raid awards, just what the guild has in the bank.  Keeps spell-lists, research component lists etc that are available to guildmembers at large.  Runs the 'guild-trader-mule' and publishes the current guild-bank listing to the web.<br />
<br />
5 - Recruitment Officer - In charge of recruiting new members and making sure that applicants have performed all necessary tasks.  In charge of applicants until their probation period is up.<br />
<br />
6 - Raid Leader/Officer - One person or a few who are in charge of planning, executing and recording raid events for the guild.  Totally in charge of the raid force from start to finish.  Establishes objectives and strategy (hopefully along with suggestions from others on the 'Raid Committee').  Appoints looters and makes the 'call' if a raid goes sour or doesn't have enough people.  Keeps all records of attendence and loot awards.  Publishes these to the web for guild review.  ONLY experienced level-headed, non-confrontational people need to apply tks tks np np..<br />
<br />
7 - Officer at Large - These are people who are not holding a 'titled' position but have aquired officer status because of their leadership and dedication to the guild.  If you have a lot of these running around and they don't ever seem to do anything, then you probably have too many.  EVERY Officer-at-Large SHOULD be on some committee or otherwise contributing to the betterment of the guild in the background.  Not just by winning 'phat lewts' online but by putting in their comments, suggestions, tips, tricks or other contributions on the message boards or in committees and REALLY contributing to the betterment of the guild.  They should be ACTIVELY looking for ways to improve the guild and always should be working to better the guild and achieve it's objectives.<br />
<br />
<br />
The most important thing I could say is do not overload your guild with officers.  Do not make 'officership' a status symbol.  Do not 'reward' the 'cool guy' with an officer title because he won a popularity contest.  If an officer is not ACTIVELY contributing then they should be 'politely', 'quietly' and 'discreetely' asked to step down.  Give their slot to someone else instead of creating a new one.<br />
<br />
I've been an officer in two different large guilds and have held many positions.  My best advice is only create officers and positions that you absolutely need.  NO guild has the same playstyle as another.  Some guilds may need more officers, some may need only a few.  The only guideline that dictates any 'numbers' that you should have is that there must be enough officer positions to allow your guild to have at least one or two online at any time.  That is the only quantitative guideline that I think anyone can really give you.  The rest depends on goals, style, numbers and activity level.<br />
<br />
Remember, all officers are servants to the guild.  Once this attitude is lost, it's time to get a new officer.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">You can easily run into the "all chiefs no Indians" scenario with guild officers. I have seen guilds where it seems like everyone is automatically promoted to "officer" once they have reached a certain tenure in the guild. That just creates havoc, especially if your invitation rules are loose and people aren't paying attention to them. Having been an officer in my current guild for the past year (more on that in a minute) I can tell you that the key factor in our guild's success is very careful screening and selection of members. We don't get 100% on this but I can also count the number of people we have had to /guildremove on the fingers of one hand.<br />
<br />
I say I have been an officer for a year even though this particular toon has only been around since June 2003. In our guild the PEOPLE are the officers, not the toons, so our alts tend to get officer-tagged as well. It's especially helpful having my druid alt have the officer mojo, because she can easily travel to different sites to tag alts as needed. My main Zeralenn is the guild's War Master (raid leader). <br />
<br />
My guild has about 250 toons (about 60 mains) with 9 officers, a few of whom are not on the game much anymore. We have more than adequate coverage for what we need to do -- usually tag alts and audition new members, and very very rarely deal with problems and disputes (when the job isn't fun). So our ratio, rounded, is about 7 mains to 1 officer.<br />
