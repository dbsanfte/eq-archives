<br />
What, in your opinion, is the hardest class to master?  <br />
<br />
I, personally, would say Enchanter.  I've never played one (well, past the newbie levels anyway) but I've always admired the really skilled enchanter in a heated fight.  Takes nerves of steel to mez, have someone break mez, get whacked a bunch, stay in there and remez, yell at player who broke mez....rinse repeat.<br />
<br />
Clerics take skill and nerves too, but I'm thinking of class other then cleric.  WE all know clerics need skill, that's why we're all here reading these forums.<br />
<br />
Gimme your choice for toughest class to master...OTHER then cleric.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I don't really think this is a fair question.  Besides, all of them are equally hard to master ( if you compare the ups and downs of all classes.)<br />
<br />
First off, every single class has something that is really hard.  For Warrior, it is getting a ton of hp's and good output. (This may see easy, but I have played a Warrior to level 48, and the stuff is EXPENSIVE!)  For a Magician, it is trying to get a lot of mana and keeping his pet alive while not overnuking.  But for a Shadowknight, he has to get good hp's in case he ever has to be the main tank, and he has to maintain bone chips so he can summon a skelly to put out more damage.  And, for a monk, he has to keep aggro off of him, get high agility so he can dodge more, and have a great damage output.<br />
<br />
(All of these aren't just based one on class, but the category of class.  I.E-Damage Outputters: Rouge, monk, etc.)<br />
Just my 2cp.</td>

I'm talking about pure skill.  <br />
<br />
Melee, God love em, are fairly straight forward (my opinion).  I have a 60+ Rogue and I get bored to tears most of the time.  Not to say that Rogues don't take a fair amount of skill in certain scenario's, because they do.  I will admit that I have never played another melee class in the high end game, so I could be way off base.  Just a friendly question about difficulty level for diff't class's.<br />

Enchanters, to me, take a lot of skill...GOOD Enchanters take a lot of skill, I should say.</td>

<br />
Second would be Enchanters, I like to refer to them as the Traffic Cops of Norrath. If your not on your toes with this class your not gonna be very good. They have lots of abilities like the bard and keeping on your toes is a must. Learning to use F9 is something that takes a while to master. F9 use is a must as an enchanter if you plan to be a Great Enchanter. Also Enchanters can be like clerics at times and be slow. So they have their moments and like the cleric class ya never know when that moment is gonna arrive.<br />

Any time I see a bard twisting: March of Wee, Warcry of the Vah Shir (i think thats what its called), Haste, and Healing song while still beating on a mob i am always truly impressed.  But what really impresses me is when a bard starts Crowd Controlling on a over pull while still twisting in thier haste song.  Bards are a work of art when played well, IMO toughest class to master by far.</td>

Okay, if you put it like that, my answer would also have to be a bard.  My brother has a level 55 bard on the E'Ci server named Wrexx Wyndrider.  He can twist 4! songs while meleeing with his Troubadors Mace and Singing Short Sword.  Watching him play has taught me that bards are very, very hard, and if you have ever tried to twist songs, it can be even harder.  So, I think bards are the hardest.</td>

<br />
Yes, physically, a bard is difficult to play and hard on your hand/wrist. But as far as the skill of knowing what to do and when to do it, along with the number of spells you have to juggle, aggro and mana management, etc.  Druid gets my vote.<br />
<br />
And I think the large number of "bad" druids supports this. It is a hard class to play well.<br />
<br />
For background, My main is a 65 druid, I have a 51 ranger, 53 cleric, used a friends 60 enc for several months while he was gone (when 60 was the cap), and played a bard to the high 20's.<br />
<br />
Enc: Haste the melee, slow the mob, mez the adds. It's not that hard. Yes, it's easy to die if you mess up, but it's not rocket science.<br />
<br />
Bard: (sometimes) pull with pacify, then rotate between 3-4 keys when fighting. Swarm kiting is probably trickier. I never did it.<br />
<br />
Cleric: Sit-med-heal. Yes, I know some of you (us) do more than that, but no more is really expected of you. Overall, the easiest caster class to play, except maybe the wizard.<br />
<br />
Druid: I'll spare you the list of all their abilities/responsibilites. I will say my druid has 22 pages of spells he uses, compared to about 8 my cleric uses. Five of them are ports, take away a few more because he is higher level, but that still leaves about twice as many. <br />
<br />
In my 4.5 years of EQ, the most knowledgable and talented people in the game have consistently been the well-played druids. And yes, a lopsided majority of the jerks and people who get the group wiped have also been druids (closely followed by rangers).<br />
<br />

Bards are the toughest class to play, there's no doubt about it.  A bard has so many talents and has to be good at them ALL to be successful.  There's few things so sweet in the game than playing with a good bard.  They are the perfect grouping character.<br />
<br />
The point on druids has a lot to do with bards.  No, they can't mez and have limited charm, lulling and other skills, but because the druid has SO many skills and uses, it is tough to balance them.  A GOOD druid has to know all about his/her spells and when they can/cannot use them.  I've played a druid for over four years and he is probably my #1 character in fun and overall skill.  I never feel like there is anything I cannot do (barring silly stuff like soloing a dragon, even though one could argue it's been done).  I have seen SO many bad druids, it's boggling.  I have had the most fun with my druid soloing for the challenge, and since I've been 50+, the fun has been in PoP duo'ing with my wife's chanter and charming..  It's very exciting and challenging.  To know that two people can take down level 61+ mobs in zones that were originally designed as raid content is very satisfying.<br />
<br />
A cleric isn't tough for me, but stressful.  I have certainly seen very bad clerics.  Timing heals vs which heal to use, when and crowd control when aggro is out of hand makes the cleric stressful.  There's a lot to know and understand about aggro.. there's nothing worse to the group than a cleric who dies over and over because he has aggro.  An excellent cleric also knows when to melee and when to sit on his/her arse.<br />
<br />
I also have to say that the main tank is tough to play.  I say main tank and not a specific class, because it's the stress involved in being the leader of the group/raid as far as controlling the outcome of the initial battle, and possibly the ending that's stressful.<br />
<br />
So, for me it's:<br />
<br />
Bard<br />
Druid<br />
Cleric<br />
Warrior (since I have one, insert the main melee here)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">There's definitely a difference between asking which is the toughest class to PLAY and which is the toughest to MASTER. With some classes, it's not hard to figure out the basics and do a halfway decent job, but it might be much harder to get to the point where you are really wringing that extra bit of potential out of your class, achieving things the vast majority of people don't even attempt.<br />
<br />
Different environments can influence how hard it is to play a certain class. Some classes can be very complicated at times and very easy at others (I oftend find the enchanter to be one of the most difficult classes to master, but to some degree on high level raids it can become simple/boring.<br />
<br />
One also has to consider what is meant by "toughest"... for instance, without a doubt I think bards are the most physically challenging to play well (I say this based on reading up on the class and on having played a bard up to the whopping level of 13 -- I make no claim whatsoever to have mastered even the basics). Twisting requires constantly toggling songs on and off, so you're constantly at work, and switching among songs and instruments and weapons and so on involves intricate patterns of keypressing with fairly precise timing... there is a physical skill to be leanred, like playing a piano.<br />
<br />
The concepts involved in playing the cleric are pretty simple and it's not hard in most cases to do a halfway decent job (thus the reason you see so many cleric bots)... but in a group that pushes the envelope it takes real talent to come out shining and keep bodies from hitting the floor. In fast-paced play, the cleric can be one of "toughest" in terms of stress; spiky damage and mobs that can kill in a few swings means you have to be alert at all times, any lapses WILL be noticed. a fast connect is more of a factor than it is for many classes.<br />

Hands down easiest in my opinion is the warrior. As long as you are fortunate to get in a good guild providing decent loot, maintaining aggro and standing back with auto attack isn't too difficult (though I'm exhaggerating slightly).</td>

It by far requires more attention and management than any other class when played to their potential.. There are a lot of mediocre bards.. but when you see a truely exceptional bard, it's awe inspiring.. The best bard I ever saw could pull for the group, main tank, keep the 3-4 adds he brought back mezzed, dot and dd the mob we're on, and play all the group songs without missing a beat. it was truely amazing to watch..</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think more credit is due to warriors. In raid situations, with push elements, the warrior is responsible for the placement of the mob. If his turns and curves bring himself out of the clerics range he is liable to die and possibly cause a raid wipe. This is definately tougher than say a rogue, who's raid duties mean sitting behind the mob and hitting the backstab key, and dragging corpses.</td>

I think many of us are guilty of underestimating the nuances involved with all classes. Even the easiest class can be fairly challenging to "master". I know I'm guilty of it in my earlier post. <br />

See what I mean? :)<br />

I'll have to get my bard back out. I like a challenge, but it just didn't seem as hard as everyone is saying. Hotkeys do most of the work for you. Maybe it gets a lot tougher at higher levels.</td>

I've been in groups where even rogues have shined to more of an effect than just evading and poking.

<br />
New poster here :) As well as my 56 Cleric, I've got a 65 Bard who is my main.<br />
<br />
I want to clarify what some have said about Bards: we are NOT the hardest class to play. Some Bards will say we are, but in my opinion, all it takes is manual dexterity. Now, what we are is a hard class to play properly. It takes skill to know what songs you need to sing in any situation, and for that you will need a good knowledge of your class.<br />
<br />
A lot of players get daunted by this. But on the other hand, I'd be daunted playing a Shaman if I hadn't played one before! For one thing agro management is far easier with a Bard since we're specifically coded to not generate agro. An example: I can debuff, slow 52%, and snare a mob on inc. As soon as anyone else touches the mob, they will have agro 99pc of the time.<br />
<br />
And twisting songs is not difficult either. Choose three, whack them onto your hotbox, and press the keys to start a song, press a key to stop it and then start the next song. If you can twist four songs it doesn't mean you're a good Bard - it means you've got a fast computer and a good, stable connection ;) "Twisting" more then four generally means you have an effect from a Bard clicky / Epic proc etc which lasts longer than the 18 second duration of a Bard song.<br />
<br />
I hope this clarifies things :)<br />

Yes, that's why they're adding new abilities to warriors ~ because it's so easy for them to maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
Seriously they're not as easy to play as most people think.  My boyfriend plays a warrior and most of the time when we LDoN he's the only melee in group.  That means he pulls, guides us through the dungeon, makes my life easier by making sure he's the only one to get beat on (and with the tools he has as a warrior he does an excellent job), positions mobs, and keeps an eye out for adds.  The only crowd control we've used of late is pacification and sometimes rooting adds or in a pet heavy group, putting pets on adds.  I'm amazed at how much he does and how much he is aware of.  I'm convinced he's part chanter. ;)<br />
<br />
You might as well put cleric heal/med in the same category if you're going to simplify a class that much.</td>
