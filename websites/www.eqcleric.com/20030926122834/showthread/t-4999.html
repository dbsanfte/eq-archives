<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Epic camps.  Bergergle, Gimblox, the Skyfire shards, and the wait for the human merchant.  I keep reading posts from people who think those are time-consuming, and I just can't keep quiet.<br />
<br />
<i>The cleric epic is not hard any more.</i><br />
<br />
I helped a friend of mine to get hers epic in three days flat.  We killed Overking Bathezid with one group.  Of alts.  I think nobody who killed Bathezid even bothered to log in their main that day.  After a quiet afternoon spent at the VP entrance camping shards, we did kill Rage with our mains, because there were only three of us around; druid, cleric, and shadowknight -v- Zordakalicus Ragefire, and I spent more mana nuking than healing.<br />
<br />
Now, back in the day, the cleric epic <i>used</i> to be hard.<br />
<br />
I took a thirty-person raid into Chardok for my note from Overking Bathezid.  And we wiped between the palace gates and the library.  Five times.  If I hadn't been guildleader, I would never have gained the support to keep going.<br />
<br />
Five successive weekends running, the guild paid for 30 coffins to get our raid out of Chardok.<br />
<br />
A few weeks later, once I had my singed scroll, the "changes" to Ragefire were implemented.  Nobody had figured out his timer; I just sat in Skyfire and camped him.  When I got too tired, I had relatives and friends log me in and keep watch.<br />
<br />
Over 170 hours later, he popped, and another guild beat me to the spawn.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's 170 hours staring at the wall in Skyfire, for nothing.<br />
<br />
So I camped him again.  It took longer the second time.  And when he popped - at 4am my time, I was woken by a telephone call from Australia - I called in every favour anyone owed me in the game in order to get four groups together so as to be certain of killing him.<br />
<br />
And I had an easier time of it than some.<br />
<br />
I killed over 60 PH's for Gimblox, but compared to the rest of my epic, Gimblox was just trivial.  What's thirty hours solo camping a goblin?  You'll do worse things for your VT key, that's for certain.</td>

<br />
I just completed mine, and I have this feeling 'That's it ??' - certainly when you compare it to other classes, the cleric epic is not hard.<br />
<br />
Gimblox and Bergurgle can be soloed. Boring yes, but easy as hell. Ixi is a one group thing these days. Overking isn't that hard either, but can be a bit of a problem for a new guild. Shards aren't that bad, and ragefire is a bloody joke. I resisted all of his AoEs, we took him down in 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
Compare that to the Mage epic, then get back to me ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and another things... all of the mobs we need to kill drop the epic piece EVERY TIME.  Unlike the aformentioned mages, who need a staff from Phinny that drops maybe once in 15 kills.</td>

I did my Epic late in my career and I non-shalontly collected what I needed over the span of a week.  The hardest part was Chardok because it wasnt later till I learned how to get there with a single group so I had to wait for a few people to help me out.  Rage is a pure joke nowa days.  Just killed him this weeked and our tank didnt even need one heal.<br />

<br />
Yep, I am coming up on PH #45 for just Lord Gimpy. Yep, I am starting him now <i>because</i> there will be several other long, boring camps.<br />
<br />
It would be fine if it were like, say, my Shaman epic...some few hours spent camping, but not many. Just gather the right forces and have at it. (Of course, an epic that requires a Hole Raid, a Fear Raid and CoM time is still not a cake walk...but at least it's a plannable thing).<br />
<br />
Oh, and the classes that aren't even gauranteed to get their drop even after they kill the mob have my complete sympathies. Doesn't make me feel any better about staring at a wall for 14+ hours for one step, however.<br />
<br />
I sincerly doubt I will bother with doing the Epic for any of my other characters. The only reason I will put up with this for the Cleric is because my Guild (and, no doubt, countless random strangers) will really benefit from the clicky stick. <br />
<br />
The Shaman will prolly do as far as the InstaSoW Boots at some point, but and further progress will occur just because I happen to be there doing other things.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wish the Epics had been designed to <b>require</b> that they be done by the Character in question, and done solo. To my mind, it should be about how good you are with your class, not how many people can you bring for a ZergFest or how long you are willing to stare at a wall. That, however, is a rant for another day.</td>

ya sure epic is easy when you have caracters lvl 65 and hundreds of aa helping you.<br />
<br />
but belive me, there are plenty of people without the support or the guilds with uber twinked alts to help them out. because i bet the 3 of you that killed rage were NOT wearing kael armor or less.<br />
<br />
don't trivilize other people who are working on something that for them, is not easy. it seems to you that "back in the day" it was harder. well alot of people are still back in the day. and the only part that is easyer now is you don't have to camp ragefire.<br />
<br />
sorry if i am coming off a bit harsh. but when i did my epic, i was in a small guild, and it was a very big acomplishment when first one cleric in our guild got there epic, and then i got mine. heck my old guild just finaly got there first epic warrior done!<br />
<br />
the guild i am in now could go to chardok and aoe our way down and kill the king in 30 min or less. but to alot of people this is just not possible, and chardok is still the hell zone you remember "back in the day".<br />

I personally am stuck at the Chardok part of my epic. I am currently the highest level member of my guild, I think, and with my work schedule, I cannot get into any of the big guilds that have minimum attendance requirements. I was able to gather a group of 50-55's to kill Ixiblat.. 23 of us in fact, and when Ixi fell, 11 were standing.. since I had bound close to Ixiblat's spawn point, I actually died twice from healing agro. I have tried to fund one 2 party raid to get Overking, but it we got whiped very early on.. not even to royals.   I worked for a while to get my Skyfire Fragments, say 30 hours or so, getting whole groups or partners to go kill in Skyfire with me, or soloing them as slow as that goes. I am to the point now that all I can do is the singed scroll. <br />
<br />
You think the epic is trivial?  Try doing it as those of us who dont have lvl 60+ alts to kill everything for us have to.<br />

[B]/rant on (grrr i normaly don't rant) <br />
<br />
ya sure epic is easy when you have caracters lvl 65 and hundreds of aa helping you.<br />
<br />
but belive me, there are plenty of people without the support or the guilds with uber twinked alts to help them out. because i bet the 3 of you that killed rage were NOT wearing kael armor or less.<br />
<br />
don't trivilize other people who are working on something that for them, is not easy. it seems to you that &quot;back in the day&quot; it was harder. well alot of people are still back in the day. and the only part that is easyer now is you don't have to camp ragefire.<br />
<br />
sorry if i am coming off a bit harsh. but when i did my epic, i was in a small guild, and it was a very big acomplishment when first one cleric in our guild got there epic, and then i got mine. heck my old guild just finaly got there first epic warrior done!<br />
<br />
the guild i am in now could go to chardok and aoe our way down and kill the king in 30 min or less. but to alot of people this is just not possible, and chardok is still the hell zone you remember &quot;back in the day&quot;.<br />

<br />
Sorry to add this in but I must agree fully. I'm slowly working on my epic in my tiny guild on stromm we use what we get to drop and I just recently got out of all my newbie armor at 40.<br />
<br />
I dont even want to think of Chardok much less Ixiblat or Ragefire. Mobs that used to be trivial farmfests for me in my old guild on vaz are now scaring me again. I must say I like this, it brings new excitement to this game but as Keyera said don't trivilaize those of us who are just surving on what drops we get and barley affording our spells.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that was too harsh but I'ts how I feel and this is rants and raves :) No hard feelings back on vaz I would have said the same thing but now I live in a different world and its much more fun.</td>

<br />
One good thing about the overking though is that most clerics will wind up getting at least one of their rarer high-50s Kunark spells off him as well as their epic piece.  When we did overking, we stayed for a second spawn for another cleric (who was 65) so I wound up getting TWO spells I didn't have :)   Word of Replenishment and The Unspoken Word both dropped.. not the best spells in the world but hell they cost an arm and a leg in the bazaar LOL<br />
<br />
Sure the Ragefire camp is gone, and thank god for that.  To some guilds the epic is trivial and can be done in a day, but to the little guy, it's still a huge accomplishment.  I'm very very proud of mine :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">No disrespect for the newer Epic-doers, but I see some of what Shadowfrost is saying. Even if you don't have an "army of 65 level people" to help you, the epic of today is still easier than the epic of the Kunark era. Blame mudlfation for that, as there are literally tons of tools (items, gear, etc) available today that weren't available back then.<br />
<br />
I guess, with the changes of the camps, and the game in general, epics seem a little less "epic" than they did back then. (Granted, I still say most of the easier epics were never "epic" quests, because there is just nothing "epic" about sitting on your ass at a spawn point) To date, the only epic that comes close to being what I'd like to see is the SK epic, because it has a cohesive story. Most of the epic quests lack that quality, and it's a shame, because they could have done alot with many of them.</td>

I still do not hold my Epic, but being a roleplayer, it is difficult to follow the Cleric epic storyline as I have yet to find one.<br />
<br />
With the additions of Velious, Luclin, PoP & Ykesha, one would have thought that maybe they could have perhaps added a bonus to the Epic... more to the nonexistant plotline or for those who already hold their epics, a chance to inhance the Epic's powers even greater.. I mean with 4 complete expansions since their creation, the Epics could have been expanded upon in so many ways.. <br />

Personally I thought the storyline for the cleric epic was appropriate to the class and rather interesting.  The camps weren't fun but the story was reasonably good.<br />
<br />
It starts as a tale of contrition and atonement - killing Lord Bergergle was a Bad Thing To Do - and works its way up, through a conspiracy of the Plasmatic Priests working to summon a Big Baddie (Ixiblat Fer), to the final confrontation with the evil Ragefire and a reward offered by the Avatar of Water.  The cleric epic is about the triumph of the Triumvirate of Water over the evil Fire-based beings.<br />
<br />
A Water Sprinkler is also the name of a kind of medieval weapon favoured by those who had taken Holy Orders.</td>

/me becomes serious for a moment..<br />
<br />
All that to say that i <i>should</i> have said that I can't find a "roleplay" reason for my character to follow the storyline.. It works great for good races.. Heck if I was a HE Cleric I would be /shouting about Armagedon.. and praying for atonement for slaying Bergurgle but i am not. Thus far, the <i>ONLY</i>  reason i can find in reguards to Roleplay in gaining the Epic is to prevent a Good Cleric from gaining it first...<br />
<br />
As for this threads origional intent, I have to say that because I origionaly did the Paly Epic, I have a respect for the "old" quests before they were altered. I know a few clerics who feel "cheated" because when they performed the quest, it took weeks and major management of players to coordinate and gain the epic and now there are guilds performing the same task in 3 days or less.<br />
<br />
I personally hold any cleric who performed the Epic <i>before</i> it was altered in High respect and reguard but being a member of a small guild, I also have to be thankful that Verrant has taken steps to see that I too can gain my Epic. Were I the one to make the decision, I would have at least changed the color of the new Epic weapon or the color of the Epic's spell effects so that Older Epic'ed clerics had a small "Badge of honor" by being at least slightly different.<br />
<br />
That being said, I can also see where that might have split our class in two.. causing Rivalry and infighting in a close knit class like Clerics. Both sides of the coin have valid points..</td>

All I have to say, is be glad that our epic still has some use to it :)  Imagine being the enchanter, who has clicky haste on their epic but have a better haste they can cast now.  At least its still the highest percent rez we have (ignoring AA's) and normally costs lots of mana! :)</td>

Here's the dark elf MO: Hey, sounds like fun. Sure, I'll go kill a goblin. Grr, by Innoruuk's tiny testicles, I hate goblins! So you kill Begurgle and bring back his crown, and Natasha says to you, you crackfiend! WTH are you doing? Go to Omat Vastsea to fix what you've done.<br />

Well, I don't LIKE being tricked. Let's see what this water fool has to say. Ooh! Kill another goblin? Sure!...Plasmatic who? Grr, they were the ones that tricked me. I hate them too. Kill them all!<br />

There's more? Must kill...must not be used as a pawn...ok, I can kill this Vastsea schmuch afterwards, but first those fire bastards!<br />

OK, Hi Mr. Sarnak. Which way to the overlord? I have an appointment. No really I do. I don't care about killing the goblins in Droga for some stupid ring, I've had enough goblins with rings for a while. Now where's the freaking...you're making me angry. You don't want to see me angry...<Sarnaks get tossed around and mangled>...<pant pant> so one of these corpses must be...aha! Here it is.

Yeah, THAT Zordikalus Ragefire. NOW you've got it. See, you didn't put the two names together before? Dumbass.

I'm not going to, well, ok sure, I'll take this to your Ragefire guy up in Nagafen's Lair. <pockets pearl> Yeah, sure there will be a reward.

I don't really want to do this, but I may as well finish this genocide. How many more plot twists can there be? This pearl is so shiny tho...<br />

Excuse me, Mr. Ragefire? Omat Vastsea told me to give you this. Hey, don't kill the messenger! Oh, I'm making YOU angry? I already used that line three paragraphs ago. You think it's..gon..na...DRAGON!!!<br />

Geez, that dragon was a putz. I probably could have soloed him. Too bad that raiding party that wanted to kill Nagafen came along...morons, naggy was killed three days ago.<br />

Looking ahead to taking out Ixblat, Ragefire(s) and the Chardok King scare the hell out of me!<br />
<br />
I have to agree, though, that it looks like our epic quest has become a bit easier with Ragefire being a triggered spawn now. I also notice that our epic does NOT require us to visit any planes, which makes it easier in my opinion (fresh after visiting and wiping in the plane of hate). I think that we get our few potentially long camps (bergugle, grimblox) to make up for the easier zones.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess my point is that going after the epic for me is a monumental task, and I will be the first cleric in my guild to get it. It's all a matter of perspective...</td>
