In CoM, the group is a Necro, Cleric (me), Chanter, 2 Warriors, and an SK. <br />
<br />
All of the afore mentioned group have been grouping together for a few weeks. All of us are dungeon crawlers and have been living in Sol B, CoM and LGuk, pretty much just keeping each other <i>out</i> of Dreadlands. <br />
<br />
Our Enchanter is <i>excellent</i>, very capable of handling multiple mob pulls, we've handled 9+ mobs fairly easily. <br />
<br />
Maybe we were feeling ****y, maybe we were just itching to die... <br />
<br />
Our SK (who is our usual puller) had told us "Just a warning, if you ever ask me to 'make it a good one' when I'm pulling you <i>will</i> lose exp." So, on this fateful day, our Chanter tells the SK to 'make it a good one'. <br />
<br />
The SK runs off and comes back with about 30 mobs. Our Enchanter is furiously trying to AE mez to the best of his ability and I'm doing everything I can to keep everyone alive. The Enchanter tells the group in all caps "MERRY ZONE MERRY ZONE". <br />
<br />
I zone out of CoM listening to the sounds of my group dying behind me. <br />
<br />
Now, most folks would have been upset at someone in their group bringing a train like that on purpose, but we are a curious group of folk. As folks start poping at their bind point the group chat looks something like this. <br />
<br />
Chanter tells the group: 'omg that was spectacular!' <br />
SK tells the group: 'i told you never to say that...' <br />
Necro tells the group: 'merry, you make it out?' <br />
Merrybrook tells the group: 'yeah' <br />
Necro tells the group: 'what % is your rez?' <br />
Merrybrook tells the group: '90%' <br />
Warrior1 tells the group: 'omg rofl, that was huge' <br />
Merrybrook tells the group: 'no one ever say that again LOL' <br />
Chanter tells the group: 'a good one means like 9 not 30+ LOL' <br />
Necro tells the group: '/agree' <br />
<br />
Our SK (who is for some odd reason very skilled at CR) made it back and pulled everyone's corpses for me to rez. <br />
<br />
The next day we're back in CoM and 2 of our group members have to log off. There was a Monk and a Shaman that were grouped together looking to join a larger group. They had trained us a couple of times and caused us to wipe once. Thus I was amazed (after rezzing my group from the wipe thse two had caused) when I see them join our group. <br />
<br />
We head back to our camp spot and I get a tell from our Chanter 'get ready to zone'. I reply back 'why?' <br />
<br />
Chanter tells the group: 'SK, make it a good one'. <br />
<br />
The SK runs off and drops to around 60% health very quickly. I get another tell from our Chanter 'zone now'. And off I go! <br />
<br />
Ahhh, sweet revenge!  ;) <br />

Bwah! Love it.<br />
<br />
My favorite CR so far was pulling a Cleric's corpse out of the sonic wolves cave in Hollowshade. We had been there for a while when all the blue mobs suddenly dried up (no, no one had started the war. I still don't know what caused it). <br />
<br />
He said he knew how to get to the 'Home of the owlbears', so I said "Sure, what the heck".<br />
(Mentally wondering wtf he was talking about...especially since he needed my help finding Hollowshade to begin with)<br />
<br />
So he leads me towards GF zone, we get seperated, I get there and say "This it?"<br />
After a few area descriptions he said "No, it's farther south.'<br />
<br />
I looked at my map...yep, I see a cave down there...maybe there is a zoneline I don't know about. Okay, let's give it a whirl...<br />
<br />
We meet up at the cave entrance and see the sonics guarding outside. He insists this is the place. Our plan is that he will use DA and drag them away a bit, and I'll do an end run through to the zone. (Mind you, I was still very new to coming back, and knew <i>nothing</i> about Luclin zones. This wasn't any zone <i>I</i> had heard of, but maybe it was just something I hadn't seen yet...)<br />
<br />
Our battle plan firmly in place, he goes and grabs the sonics outside, pulls 'em away and DA's before following me in.<br />
<br />
I run in, see all the wolves and no zoneline, and start yelling "CAVE! ABORT!" while spinning around and running out as fast as my trolly legs will carry me. Too late, he had followed me in and was stunned by a Rabid Lag Beast. The wolves finished him off.<br />
<br />
I, on the other hand, made it to GF and was able to zone. A minute or so later, I came back in to watch the wolves migrating back to their caves.<br />
<br />
No Necros or SK's in zone...so no summoning for poor Mister Cleric, and there was no way he was going to get his corpse back without help. He made it back just as I managed to finish medding back to full, so I had him throw his buffs on top of mine and set off to recover his corpse...with him watching from a safe distance.<br />
<br />
I made it back in, targeted his corpse, and headed back out. Stunned twice. This could get bad...<br />
<br />
Nope, I'm out and high tailing it back to GF zoneline, hitting the /corpse hotkey like a madman. About halfway there I get a message from him along the lines of 'OMG!'<br />
Apparently, there was a moving wave of wolves on my tail the whole way.<br />
<br />
I had almost forgotten about the whole thing, actually, except last night a Druid friend sent me a tell...seems he had just pulled a huge train from the sonic cave to GF and was proud of himself for living through it. He's level 49.<br />
<br />
My response? "I did it twice...at 29"</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have found that things can occasionally get very exciting in BoT.  Specifically I am reffering to the South Top camp.  As many of you know, the mobs in BoT are frequently buggy.... this leads to fun times ever now and then.  As the groups cleric... expecting the obligation of rezzing everyone after the wipe... I've found a way to make things go a bit faster while having a good ol time.   I simply pop the DA and chug my short legs on down towards the Entrance camps.  Now of course as an honorable lil dude I certainly don't train my way out of zone.  But stopping at the doorway with about thirty giants on yer tail sure gets the zone all excited.  I can just imagine all the /g chatter  "oh shit, watch out"   ha.   But ya know if your corpse is chillin there close enough for the lower groups puller to drag ya for a rez.. it sure saves a lot of time.  Oh the fun of BoT. oh and by the way yesterday I killed the named up top there in the south.. and the punk dropped fungus and a spectral!  how lame.   Cheers</td>

Yeah I know what you're thinking. Those see-invis mobs. Well they got the group. I was able to root the mobs and camp out. <br />
I come back and they're all pissed at me for camping out. Whatever, I make it back to the zone line safe. Eventually they all show up back in the zone. One of them is looking for a necro in pok while I load up Wake of Tranquility and pull the corpses out of the arena to a spot where invis works fine =)<br />

5 corpses to the zone from the arena without getting hit once. I was so thrilled =)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hehe Merrybrook, Would you like to trade your Crazy Sk for a completely Nuts Warrior?<br />
<br />
Having just reached 35, Dowel, his trusted /pet warrior and their faithful Necro companion found themselves in Sro searching for the Ancient Cyc. After about an hour of killing whatever wandered by, the warrior stands and announces, "We need to kill place holders?.. then I guess it's  <i>Roundup</i> time".<br />
<br />
Not too sure what he ment, myself and the necro stayed sitting on the hillside by the oasis zoneline and watch as after a while, the warriors health slowly drops a percentage at a time..  After about 10 minutes, we told him to head back our way but he insisted that he needed "the final touch" and kept running all over the zone with this large dark mass at his heels..<br />
<br />
At long last he simply says "Inc" and from where we were sitting, it looked like an old 1950's horror movie with this wave of everything imaginable running behind him. I have no honest idea how many mobs there were but he claims that he got them "all"  including the orcs at the orc camp.. every madman, every drybones, every mummy every spider and all the extras thrown in for fun. AoEs were flying and the bodies were dropping everywhere until his "final touch" arrived... Terrorantula.. <br />
...<i>Loading...Please wait...</i> <br />
Having bound just on the other side of the zoneline , I was first on the scene.. and what a glorious scene it was..looked like a Civil War battlefield.. had to actually Loot bodies to find my friends corpses.. ROFL..<br />
Now whenever the Warrior is bored.. and claims its Roundup time.. My cursor somehow finds its way to hover over the Gate Spellgem..  but what a laugh we still get at what we call our "Epic Battle".</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Just last night as a matter of fact!!  What a craptacular whipeout it was.. validates Murphy's Law so well even the most hardened skeptics are forced to believe.<br />
<br />
All last week I'd been having serious issues finding good groups.  I would find a group, 10 minutes later a key member would leave and the whole thing fell apart.  It was harsh.. a neverending cycle until last night.  I get invited into this POV (Plane of Velks) Razorfiend kiting group!  Two mages, a wizard, a druid, a ranger puller and me.  And to make a great situation even greater, the wizard had 63 enchanter alt that he logged on to give us KEI!!  OMG!!  I was in heaven.. the killing was swift and efficient.. the xp was flowing.  I was on track to make level 60 before bedtime (12am EST).  <br />
<br />
About an hour and a half goes by with not so much as a glitch.  All of a sudden two of the casters say they have to leave and the ranger decides he's going too.  Damn.  Group splitting up!!  But WAIT!!  Another group is just moving into the Razor camp and they need a cleric.. OMG the luck!  I skip on over and join the other group.  My luck couldn't get any better!  Back to the rockin xp .. rollin along as fast as Rosie O'Donnell chasing a McDonald's coupon in the wind!  <br />
<br />
Approaching level 60.... 3% more xp to go!  Warrior calls adds............<br />
<br />
Shaman sleeping at the wheel doesn't root add when asked.. neglects to slow either mob.  I have no choice but to cast 1k quick heals to keep warrior alive, he's loosing HPs too fast for CH.  Two heals off with no aggro now... this just MIGHT work!  BLAMO!  Some freak trains a Razor right on top of us, that's a third and he's hot and heavy after me.  Not even enough time to get a DB off.. the sucker double-quads me for some ungodly 400+ per hit damage.  I go down like Rosie O'Donnell on a patty melt.  <br />
<br />
*sigh*  there goes KEI.<br />
<br />
Zone back in immediately and run back to razors.  Somehow 3 of the 6 of us survived and are kiting two of the razors around.  Another group has shown up and took the third one.  I quickly mem CH, elixir and quickheal.  Heal up the remaining 3 members and proceed to kill our two razors.  Everything looking great!  All three razors dead, I start rezzing.  Everyone is off to either side of the main razorfiend drag, recovering.  Everyone at low HP/Mana levels.<br />
<br />
As I trod foreward from the wall carefully to pull the last corpse back to camp, I realize I don't have consent.  So I pause to type "consent me please".   While I'm typing, god only knows where it came from, but a Lumbering Beast mysteriously pops up right on top of me... in the middle of the open hilly area.   CRAP!!  I high tail it toward the zone, there's no way we can handle it in our weakened state.  The warrior gets crafty and decides he can kite it around and pulls it off me.  Our weakened group engages and the beast won't stay aggro on the warrior.. the two rogues bite it and as I'm casting heal on the warrior he bites it too.  At this point the other group decides to try to help.  THEY also get the beat-down.  I'm the only one alive at this point.   I dismount and train it to zone.<br />
<br />
When I arrived back at the Razor camp, it was the most gruesome, body-riddled field I'd seen since the Great Chardok Royals Debacle of 2001.  11 corpses scattered everywhere... /uhoh <br />
<br />
I did wind up getting 60 a little while later though :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ahh, I'll always remember Dragonmeat's final hurrah! It was a raiding party I was in, not a guild, just a bunch of people that liked to raid, had similar views, so they raided together while staying in thier own guilds. After about a year and a half, it comes time for Dragonmeat to break up, so we decide to do one more raid. Trakanon was up, so we head out to Seb, about 15 of us. We fouht down there no problem, but it was getting late so we decide to save time by charming Tol while we kill Trak. We fight, he dies. Had a good number of losses, including all the crowd control classes and more people still are dying from poison. We start killing TJ, but we managed to wipe ouot on him. You guessed it, nobody bothered to loot Trak. We get an SK back there as fast as possible, he summons his corpse and starts FD flopping down. He got into Traks lair just in time to watch the corpse poof with all the loot. <br />
Friggin classic. But, as a word about this group of people, nobody was really mad. Everyone tought it was one of the funniest things they've seen in a long time.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">About 2 and a half years ago..my guild's first break into Plane of Fear.<br />
Talk about a wipe!  I was an enchanter in the 3rd group.  We ran to camp invis only to find chaos.  I just stood there with my mouth wide open while about a dozen mobs went tearing through people...and the other groups kept coming in...(Over 30 people on the raid).  Finally, a see invis spider came and whacked me down.  Had melees getting mage summoned items and any junk they could find in their bank to attempt another break :).  Finally after 2 or 3 more full wipes one of the server's top guilds rescued us.  People lost entire yellows of exp that day.  Best memory was seeing all that chaos, though...</td>
