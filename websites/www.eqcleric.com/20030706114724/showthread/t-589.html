P.S.  And my purpose here is to learn how to be a better cleric and to help other clerics.  I just happen to also have an opinion that you shouldn't call this site eqcleric since there has been an eqcleric site since darn near the release of everquest.  There is nothing wrong with two cleric sites, but there is definetely something wrong with squatting on someone elses name.</td>

<br />
Now, if this is regarding the domain, <a href="http://www.eqcleric.com;" target="_blank">www.eqcleric.com;</a> no wrongdoing there on my part. I was looking for a domain. I went to a domain registrar. I found eqcleric.com to be available. I registered the domain and paid the fee. If there's a problem there then I can't be held accountable. If gameglow.com wanted that domain they had a lot of time to grab it. I didn't steal the domain, hijack it or otherwise. Rayne never registered that particular domain name. Seems to me he could have grabbed it at any time if he really wanted it, so please don't come here and yell at me for registering an open domain name.<br />
<br />
We've approached Rayne on a few occasions with a suggestion to merge the two sites under 1 name and on 1 domain name. He was not willing to do that, and only offered us to forward our domain name to his website and let us maintain some sort of content system. I'm sorry you're so jaded about the subject, but it's been dead and buried for some time. We leave gameglow.com alone, and you guys can leave us alone.<br />

I find it humorous that you had to go to the lenghts of registering a new hotmail email address and use a different username than your info on gameglow. Guess that's how far some of you are willing to go just to prove a mute point.<br />

Trying not to "provoke" any incidents.  But if you want to clutter up the board with an argument, here goes.<br />
<br />
I think you knew there was an eqcleric site.  And you knowingly registered your domain as <a href="http://www.eqcleric.com" target="_blank">www.eqcleric.com</a> hoping that you would pick up misdirected traffic.<br />
<br />
That is wrong.  There are a million names you could have registered, you didn't have to register a domain name that is already associated with the name of an established site.  It is really that simple.  There isn't a whole lot to argue about.  You think squatting on someone else's name is appropriate, I (and many others) do not.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen of this whole mess, we are better off agreeing to disagree and call it good.  Alright? :)</td>

<b>I think you knew there was an eqcleric site.  And you knowingly registered your domain as <a href="http://www.eqcleric.com" target="_blank">www.eqcleric.com</a> hoping that you would pick up misdirected traffic.<br />
<br />
That is wrong.  There are a million names you could have registered, you didn't have to register a domain name that is already associated with the name of an established site.  It is really that simple.  There isn't a whole lot to argue about.  You think squatting on someone else's name is appropriate, I (and many others) do not.</b></td></tr></table> <br />

Actually yes, I did know there was another cleric site out there. In fact, I knew of 3-4 cleric sites out there. All suffering from the same problem: No content, no updates, just a message board. That was my inspiration in the first place. It was not directed at gameglow.com. That was the site I came across while surfing cleric sites, and the frontpage was the least appealing and not updated for months on end, and quests were all but outdated. After surfing several more cleric sites and realizing people had failed to create a strong cleric class site I decided to give it a try.<br />
<br />
I went surfing for names, came across eqcleric.com and since it was free I registered it. I considered it a gem to find such a name free. The gameglow site has been up for what? 2 years? 3 years? If that's not plenty of time to figure out you better grab a good domain name instead of using a sub-domain, then I don't know what is. This is probably the weakest argument I've ever heard. The name was free. I registered it thinking it would be a great name for a class site, and started developing.<br />
<br />
Like I said...Rayne had tons of time to grab the domain IF he wanted it. Seems to me he didn't, and neither did anyone else. I wanted it, so I paid for it. It's that simple.<br />

I just happen to also have an opinion that you shouldn't call this site eqcleric since there has been an eqcleric site since darn near the release of everquest.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">It seems to me, a very new player of the cleric class, but a veteran of EQ since pre-kunark, that the best way to "learn how to be a better cleric, and to help other clerics", would be to introduce yourself, and post in a non-contentious manner.<br />
<br />
As you can see by my post count, I am new to the boards.  I actually found this site wondering if there was a parallel to <a href="http://www.eqshaman.com" target="_blank">www.eqshaman.com</a> which I have referenced for many years.  I guess, in my case, Jarvis registered an easy to find and descriptive address, and I'm happy to have found it, and look forward to seeing it grow, and become a regular reference site for me.<br />
<br />
Your atitude, strikes me as simply rude, and I therefor have little interest in visiting the site you so blatantly spam.  Jarvis, on the other hand, at least from my point of view, has conducted himself most couterously, and has, at least to me, earned a considerable amount of respect.<br />
<br />
As I said, I am new to the cleric class, and I expect you have substancial knowledge to contribute.  Perhaps you might try packaging that information a bit more politely, and I think it would be better recieved.<br />

Its not a pretty sigh, Thatnk Innoruuk I've only encountered it a few times so far. But when you get a dozen halflings, each with a sucking machine. Its scary, even a war with the Fearless AA will run away like so many gnomes.</td>

Anyway, about gameglow--it's a good forum site, as many people there are very well learned about EQ. However, as remarked, it lacks quests, etc. In addition, it seems to sway toward the higher end game, which is fine but there are many individuals who aren't even close to worrying about mgb. I think this site does a fine job of assisting those new or recently returning to the class.</td>

<br />
Also, when I visit the REAL EQCleric site - it's this one.  Whomever the person is from that site needs some help obviously, because they intended to pick a fight with their Login name and their Signature.  I, for one, will not go there now - only because of the childish behaviour of that one person.  This site has more professionalism and quick responses to individuals who ask questions.  It will only get better from here.<br />

Posting those kind of messages is completely unnecessary.</td>
