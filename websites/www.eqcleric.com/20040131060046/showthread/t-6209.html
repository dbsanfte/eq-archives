<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">So all i hear is people and thier attitudes about hating beggers. Well, I like to help people on a young level. I guess there are people who get annoyed by people who are begging all the time, and i understand that, but should that person yell at a person in /ooc who asks for some help because they are a newb? i just want to hear peoples opinion on this and what you think about it. I know that when i was a young character noone helped me, and it was really hard, so that gives me the intent to ask people for some help if they arent using an item. what do you think about it? I know of people who have items sitting in there inventory, that dont move, that they are too lazy to sell, what would you do with it? Everyone will agree with me when i say, new kids are getting better and better, i have made 4 alts in the last 2 months, everytime i enter Paladul or Crushbone or HHK, the groups are lower and better. I was in a group the other day of 22's taking RR in HHK! All these twinked kids say, this is my main, im new. And when i ask, how did you get such good gear? they say, my friend who is higher helped me with some gear. That is not a bad thing, but everyone is welcome to state thier opinion on this thread about all the topics i have brought up. And if you feel like giving away the dusty gear you have for a cleric in your bank, Im on xegony :) (Cloudseeker). (see everyone can beg once and a while) <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">First off, I don't hate beggers. I do however dislike beggers who persist! Usually when a new person to EQ asks for help it isn't for gear, it's to ask how to do something or get somewhere. Anyone with any Experience at all should be able to spot the TRUE Newbie over the Newbie who begs to save PP or is to laxy to earnw hat they need.<br />
<br />
I have helped new players in many ways. Some with guideance, be it showing them a place to hunt or how to use their interface to giving them some PP to buy spells or bags. <br />
<br />
One of the tests I use to judge wether the person truly needs PP or not is rather than just giving up my earned PP, I will suggest a way to earn PP of their own, be it a place to camp for an item they can sell in the bazaar or what mobs to kill that give the best PP return. If they in turn make some sort of statement other than "thank you" or "how do I get there" I immediately know this person is just a lame begger who does not deserve anymore of my time.<br />
<br />
Recently I was in Thurgadin working on my shawl quests, when out of no where I get a tell from a guy who says <br />
"Hi, could you help a fellow cleric?" <br />
to which I replied, "Maybe, what ya need?" <br />
He then says "I need some PP to finish my jewelcrafting skill" <br />
so I do a /who on him to find he is /anon. So I ask him what level he is and he replies "19". Ok now I'm thinking to myself, level 19 working on jewelcraft? He obviously has another character who has earned some PP somewhere or he probably wouldnt be working JC. Then all of a sudden he pops up in front of me and types /plead. The guy is twnked with some expensive gear. Now Im thinking no way your getting any PP from me. <br />
So I reply politely "Sorry man, I am very busy and don't like to offer PP to beggers, however, I can give you some advice on where to hunt to earn some PP to help you finish your JC skill." <br />
He then replies "No, I don't want to hunt I just need some PP, please please please give me some" at this point he went on my ignore list and off I go to finish my quest. The kid follows me all over thurgadin, getting in my way etc. <br />
<br />
I am a very polite person IRL and reflect the same qualities in Everquest. But I will not be taken advantage of, nor will I stand around and let you harrass me.</td>

When I was about level 6 I had someone give me a Dwarven ringmail tunic and it was my pride and joy for quite a few levels.   <br />

I have had people pester me for items cause they're a "poor newb" and when I've inspected them they have better equipment than I do.  then of course it's always "My friend plays and he loaned me this stuff."  That I can't stand.  But I would be absloutely thrilled to find someone fresh in the game to pass on a few items to who would be gratefull and appreciate it.  <br />

I know one guy on DRo that used to cry about his corpse rotting and /ooc if anyone has any extra gear they could spare..blah blah blah.  And some nice people are always willin to help out.</td>

I do find a bit of a problem with this. The learning process began for me in this game doing the newbie armor quests. I had no clue how to play EQ, had no help whatsoever from anyone, and learned on my own. Granted, occasionally someone higher level would come by and SoW me, or give me some AC/HP buffs, but I never asked for them.<br />
<br />
My first character was a ranger, and to tell you how clueless I was I put my starting points in INT and CHA because I wanted a smart ranger that everyone liked. But when he got to be around level 40 or so I felt like I knew the game pretty well, knew how to research things on the internet on my own, and was fairly independent. Around this time I started my first alt, which is my cleric. Now I could have twinked the cleric up and bought him all sorts of armor, and gotten some guild mates to PL him. But I didn't. It was my opinion, as it still is today, that a sizeable portion of the learning experience of this game occurs early on doing your newbie armor quests. When I started my cleric I did each and every one of the armor pieces, and still have them banked on both my ranger and my cleric. <br />
<br />
When the cleric was lvl 15 or so and ready to head to PC, I will admit my ranger gave him some items, but I would hardly call it "uber gear" or even twinkage. My ranger had started working on tailoring, so the items not covered by newbie armor quests like face, shoulders, back, etc. my ranger made studded leather items and they were given to the cleric.<br />
<br />
As to the begging aspect, I'll wait until more have posted before responding fully. I will say this, however, that if more people would stop begging for things and go out and earn things for themselves, we would have a lot better players in the game today.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I ocassionally gave stuff away to people asking for help until I saw a Female High Elf Cleric running around in her newbie robe and a splintering club. I gave her a Centi Warhammer, a shiny brass shield and a couple pieces of old armor I had laying around in bank, stuff I had planned on giving to a new Pally I was trying to think of a name for.  The next day, this same Female High Elf Cleric was running around GFay looking for handouts.. yep.. in her newbie robe and carring a splintering club.  Since that day, beggers go on my /ignore list after I see them shouting to the zone 2 or 3 times.  <br />
<br />
Flip side of the coin - If I am in one of the newbie zones for some reason, and have some armor I have just looted off mobX that I plan on vender selling, or selling cheap in bazaar, and I see a sparsely dressed newbie working hard to kill stuff with the gear he/she has on, Often I will freely give out gear.  It is very nice to hear a truely thankful person's reply.</td>

<br />
It is usually pretty easy for me to sort out who is who, in much the same way as Agmy does.  If someone is asking for some plat, I'll suggest places or ways they can get some.  If they brush that off, then I know they're just a lazy player, newb or not.<br />
<br />
I emptied out some stuff from my bank that had been sitting there gathering dust and handed it out to some new characters in GFay.  I let them random on each item as it was offered, and they were genuinely thankful.<br />

Like Moonsorrow, I thought I was "the heat" with my Dwarven Ringmail Tunic and Shiny Brass Shield when I first had them.  Heck, Silver Jasper Rings and Earrings were awesome!<br />

<b>I ocassionally gave stuff away to people asking for help until I saw a Female High Elf Cleric running around in her newbie robe and a splintering club.

I hate that!  On my old Cyolos, I would (instead of selling it, because my brother and me had pretty good cash flow), give it away to some people that were higher level and low low gear.<br />
<br />
One time, I remember I was playing with my friend (he is retarded in RL, so I thought I could make him happy :D ) he ran across some character who was like level 5.  I had given him some items, not uber, like stuff for his newb armor.  He had his BP, his greaves, and his helm by then, also all cloth filled in.  They had a conversation.  I will try and remember it as best I can.  I will refer to the begger as<br />
"idiot"<br />
<br />
idiot says, Hey, nice gear for a level 7.<br />
My_Friend_01 says, Thanks<br />
idiot says, How much plat do you have?<br />
My_Friend_01 says, About 300<br />
idiot says, Wow, can you loan me 50 plat?  I want to work on my blacksmithing,<br />
(Right now I was watching, invised by my items, and I did a /who on him, and he turned out to be some anon dude.)<br />
My_Friend_01 says, Yeah sure, here you go.<br />
idiot says, Thanks!<br />
<br />
My friend is a bit nice (as he has a chemical inbalance in ihis brain),  and I found that the guy logged off, and this kept happening until he had no PP.  Dang chain beggars!  Stealin PP from from chemically unbalanced people like its an apple tree!<br />

<br />
Don't even DARE to come up and start begging from me, cause you will get a lecture about how I started out :)  Not once did I EVER  beg for a thing...I worked hard to get to where I am now, and it irks me to no end to have someone level 5 send me a tell saying "Hey you are 55? Cool... got anything to give me? Something expensive? Like a (insert expensive weapon here) I shouldn't be here in the newbie yard....I have to get to the planes by Friday."  And yes that has happend twice in the last 4 months too grrrrr<br />
<br />
I give my old gear and stuff away on occasion, but never EVER to anyone who asks for it. I invis, and hang around the newbie zones. I watch for people in their newbie tunics.... who are IN the newbie and semi-newbie zones and dying over and over with their newbie weapons.  I watch them for a good while, you know... and if they look like they are actually honest to goodness newbies (and over level 8 )...I will give them a little something to help them out...maybe some lower level armor or a better weapon that will last them til their 20's. If I see them begging in any form for anything other than advice, they are off my gift list. All I ask from them is that someday, they will do an act of kindness to another player, in some form or another... as in help on a CR or show a young player the ropes etc. If it is an item they are given, I also ask that they pass it to another little one.<br />
<br />
Yes, picky I know...but that is how I am. I made it with all my characters so far with NO power leveling, and no begging...all my stuff I have earned thru my own hunting, shrewd bazaar sales and group wins. No reason they cannot do the same.<br />
<br />
Beg from me? Ignore is my friend.  Rudely beg from me? Don't EVER expect a thing...ever...no rez no port, no nothing. Not from me nor from my alts.<br />
<br />
Sorry if you don't agree...that is my own opinion about beggars...I know I get hot under the collar about them.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have a very low tolerance for beggars, especially twinked ones. I don't care where you got the items from, if you have gear that is better than your level, you can handle fighting just fine. I don't even twink my own alts because I think it makes the game trivial so don't expect me to twink yours (most newbs you see running around are alts these days). I can always tell a true newbie because they won't send me a tell asking me for 50 plat (a sure sign that person has been in the game long enough to know how much money he needs and what it's called), and if I ask them a question, they don't know what the hell I'm talking about :).<br />
<br />
That is not to say I don't help people. I will give stuff away, buff people etc, but I will never give anything to anyone who has to ask me for something. The common response from me is that you have to level to get better stuff and to level you need to go out and kill things. You need to work for what you get. As far as buff begging goes, how they ask is very important. "Buff me plz" gets a nice "No, I'm busy", but if someone takes the time to ask politely, many times I will do it.</td>

I clawed my way up from nothing with no help from anyone. I was griefed, corpse camped, and ganked over and over by neutrals and goods that leveled up faster than I had..

I will admit i did have a little help from my cousin when i started, he bought me a few toys that i could use for a few levels (Ceremonial Hate Candle, Acrylia Studded Sleeves, Othmir Fur, and Acrylia Studded Mask), so nothing really Uber but stuff that was helpful at a low level and told me what i should try to save up for (Acrylia Cape, etc.).

So i do a /w on the guy and he turns out to be a lvl15 mage.

   However I do not mind helping a person in need, with a question, or just a newbie. I feel like a newbie could be of just about any lvl. Like If a person has 6 lvl 65's ( and has good playing skill and knowledge of the game ) and makes an alt at lvl 1 he is not a newbie. However someone's very first character ever at lvl 40 could be considered a newbie.<br />
   I recently helped someone while asking a pally LFG to join in a LDoN. He responded that he didn't have the expansion. I said np in which he then asked where he could go hunt. He was around lvl 42. I said Dreadlands. He had no idea where that was and after giving him directions I later found out that he could not get there because he only have EQ classic and PoP. I was really surprised to see someone that hi only having those two expansions. That is quite rare these days.<br />
   Considering there are very few zones he could have camped in especially if he wanted a group I told him to go to lguk which I actually had to show him myself. I gave him a quick tour and let him be. I continued talking with him a lot to find out that this was his first EQ character and that he was so excited about the game. I inspected him to find that he had less than average gear for a lvl 40 wearing a LOT of crustacean armor. To help him out I gave him about 10k pp worth of gear ( That I was just going to sell ) And I thought he was going to flip out. A bp with a higher ac than 25 and no stats WOW!!<br />
   Since then I have given him several rezzes and try to teach him stuff here and there. I think it is great to help newbies like this. <br />
   I have even went to newbie zones and offered to pay them 1 gp per spiderling silk they give me. A true newbie will be in awe of so much money. I had one newbie give me 14 silks and I in turn gave him 100pp. I knew that anyone having any knowledge of the game knows they sell easily for 5pp each in the bazaar and would not give me any. But I wanted to see if there was any true newbies who I could help out. So helping newbies rules but helping beggars is the devil!</td>
