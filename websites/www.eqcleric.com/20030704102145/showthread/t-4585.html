<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Greetings each and all. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ahmat of Erudin, Reborn Evangelical Battlepriest of Prexus. I serve in the realm of Firiona Vie, and am, to the best of my knowledge the only actively serving member of a small, and nearly unknown Order. <br />
<br />
My knowledge of the realms is moderate, my skills in battle and the healing arts are kept as up to date as my seasons of service will permit. I have but 27 seasons of service, and must say that I cannot imagine any other path for me. If you walk the many and varied paths of Norath, in the Realm of Firiona Vie. Please feel free to stop and pass a word or two, perhaps a pint of ale and a bit of news as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
((ooc <doesnt happen often, but in this case a little explanation is in order.> ))<br />
<br />
I have been playing for about a year and a half now..Beastlord, Monk, Druid, Shaman, and yes even a Necromancer (what a hoot!). After moving to FV(old school RPG vet here) and finding the experience there much more suited to my play style and tastes, I decided to try something ... as far from anything i had ever done as possible. On one of the board forums someplace i saw a list of most and least common class/race combinations... and.. Erudite Cleric is... I believe the second rarest one (Erudite Paledin being most rare.) ... then.. I read a bit about the "limitations" of the Cleric class.. and remembered that ..in my old tabletop D&D days (yeah .. even before it had an "A" at the front)  I used to LOVE playing a Cleric. and .. then it came to me ... think Jerry Fallwell, Pat Robertson, Tammy Fay and Jim baker... TV evangalist  et al... meets Norath!  <br />
Then... I got to thinking about the about "limitations"  of the class and .. I started asking some questions  mostly in game , of  high level clerics and what I discovered was.. a bit surprising. These "limitations"  are myths based on the experience of people who have never actually DONE it.  <br />
<br />
Myth one " Clerics cant solo after thier teens" ... hrmmmm so far so good anyway. As far as I can tell, its like any other class... pick yer fights carefully ... or..chose the fight you pick carefully.. ..or somethin. <br />
<br />
Myth two " You have to be guilded early to get anywhere as a Cleric. " .... Hrmmmm I am just guessing here.. but.. my guess is that... at least on FV... if you make friends.. and join raids and hunts as the "extra healer" , and build a good reputation, and build your skills and a network of friends along the way... then... you step up at level 55ish or whatever.. and say  "Level 55, Epic cleric, seeks (rp/raid/family/whatever you are looking for ) Guild. "   Then you will not have a problem finding a home. <br />
<br />
Myth three " Best Cleric Race is......(anything but Erudite)"  it was a bit odd how many times i heard this... sort of like the "Humans are only mediocre warriors at best..Troll/Ogre/Barbarian/VahShir/Iksar" are better.. thing... " (On Eci the best on the server is a Human.)   anyway.. So far... having a great time. <br />
<br />
Please pardon the length of the message, but.. i thought it important to let you all know a little about me before i start  posting many messages, particularly as some of them will contain questions... (yes very likely a few "noob" questions as well)  and having a bit more insight about Ahmat... might help with the answers a bit.  Well, that and the fact that I just  like to chatter.</td>

<br />
Since you are on the FV server to what extent do you roleplay your evangelistic cleric?  Do you sermonize?  Do you wear dark black eye liner that runs when you cry...like Tammy Faye Baker (hehe j/k.)<br />
<br />
Most of the myths you have typed about in your post have been disproved by many.  Certainly the which race/class combo is best started out as being an important decision, but with the additions to the game (items, spells, etc.) all races are alright.</td>

As per myth two, if you were on Fennin Ro I'd invite you to the ranks of my family... I've already won Numo over. You are right, you don't <i>need</i> a guild to get anywhere. But, i don't know what I'd do without my family. Its always so nice to see them all in one place xping and helping each other. People in the guild always find a group or at least something to do. Yeah, we'd all be ok without the guild, but none of us want to be. There's always someone to ask your questions of and talk into dying with you. Before you go thinking that guilds are useless and exculsive organizations, you should give one a try. You are never too young to have a home.</td>

I agree with you about soloing.  Its not as easy as grouping but it is very achievable.  It makes a difference too, I grouped with a Shammy and a Chanter last night and tanked resonably well.  Its certainly worth keeping your defensive skills up in case you get agro anyway.  With HP buffs and decent armour clerics can certainly pass for tanks in the middle levels, well maybe tankeettes.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Welcome to the boards, Ahmat.  I always wanted to meet an Erudite Cleric ;-) .  Like you, I'm one of the newer converts on this board (level 38).  My friends must have been living under a rock for quite some time, since they still don't think I can solo anything.  I'm sure those silly quadding druids get better xp, but I used to be a silly quadding druid myself, and I found it tremendously boring.  Check out ToFS when you're able to, probably level 34.  It's a fun place to take down some undeads, and it also keeps up the defense skill.  Personally, I still group more than I solo because I often play with friends, but sometimes a little soloing is in order after 3 or 4 levels of not working on melee skills.  Anyway, I hope you continue to enjoy your cleric and disprove all the myths out there.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Now.. I feeeeauuhl TRULY Blessed! (SAY AaayMaaayuhnn!!!). In answer to your questions about the peculiarities of the FV realm, and my small part in it. <br />
<br />
I can only say that as a Battlepriest of Prexus, in fact.. its very likely that I am THE Battlepriest of Prexus... I cannot walk the true path if i do not endevour , in all I say and do, to bring the light and truth of the Deep Lords teachings to each and all I encounter! GLOOOOOWWWWREAHHH !  (Can I hear a Halaleuia? ) <br />
<br />
We of Erudin are truly blessed to have developed our society to such a high degree that by our very nature we are superior among men. And with great blessing ..comes great responsibility. We should... nay we MUST  see to it .. that as many of the erm.. "less fortunate" souls as possible are brought into the light. It is a crude and backward view to hold against a person thier very nature.  Can the meer human help the way he was born? (not of Erudin that is..) He cannot! Nor the Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Ogre, Troll or any of Elvenkind. Race .. for any not born of Erudin, is simply an unfortunate accident. <br />
<br />
As a Battlepriest of Prexus is my solumn duty to bring the light and blessings of the Deep Lords truth to all! Sometimes... they are a bit harder to reach than at others... and while I admire those who worship the lesser brothers and sisters of Prexus, I must do my best to teach them the truth.  I will lay a banquet of the Deep Lords truth before all.. those who choose to eat..shall be nourished.. and made strong and wise beyond thier understanding.. those who choose to turn away.. are not my responsibility. <br />
<br />
On the other hand.... there are those .. who would through thier words, and deeds... and more often than not.. at the behest of some dark and loathsome aspiring Godling.. seek to disrupt the feast. They seek to spread the Darkness and dispair of Fear, and Hate, and Disease, among the folk of Norath. Through lies and deceptions, madness and war, yeah.. even unto the practicing of the Dark Arts.  They seek to smother the light, not only of the goodness of Prexus, but of all his Good and loving Brothers and sisters as well. It hurts to say that it is so.. but some follow the dark paths willingly and.. I am afraid the very best to be brought to them.. is a swift and merciful end to thier misirable existance.  <br />
<br />
The worst of course are the Heratics of Paineel... Evil in ignorance is.. at least to be pitied (a Troll knows no better, and who can fail to pity the Ogre's, poor cursed creatures that they are.. ) But .. the persuit of Evil even unto the practiccing of the Dark art of Necromancy,... is unforgivable... in a people who are SUPPOSED TO BE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER! <br />
<br />
There are many many wonderful blessings put here for the enrichment of our lives.. its pleasures are.. as many and varied as the faces of the folk of Norath. As a Battlepriest of Prexus, in the interest of bringing the light of truth to one not born of Erudin i must seek a common ground,  find a kinship with each and all and seek a better understanding of them, so as to better teach them of the Deep Lords Truth.  There is no better way i have found.. than to share in the entertainments and everyday pleasures of those whom I teach.  If for instance I am not able to fully appreciate the blessing of Ale, how is the child of Brell to understand the message I bring?  If I fail to appreciate the loveliness of the Elven maid as she tends the flowers in her garden.. and yea.. the beauty of the garden itsself... how is the Child of Tunare to understand the Deep Lords truth? If i cannot sit under a spreading shade tree and relish fully the bountiful pleasure of the Misty Thicket picnic then how is the child of Bristlebane to even come to understand the feast of blessings i bring before him? <br />
<br />
In short... I must seek out evil in all its dark and fetid corners.. and shine the light of the Deep Lords Truth  on it.  And I must seek out the pleasures of the world, and revel in them! That i might better my understanding of the world.. and my path in it. <br />
