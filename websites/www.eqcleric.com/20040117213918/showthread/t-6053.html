<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">and omg I wanted to cry :( <br />
<br />
We went to kill AoW and Vindi, and I at least got some decent faction hits. However, my first healing chain was not quite what I had hoped it would be. I have gotten compliments in the groups I have been in, and I figured that since I was a good cleric (at least people  said I was), that I would start breaking Kery into the raiding environment. Get her feet wet and test the waters as they say.<br />
<br />
Needless to say it was NOT what I thought it would be.<br />
<br />
It was AWFUL :(<br />
<br />
I was so upset by the end of the encounter, I was terribly glad that there was a thunderstorm going thru the area so I was forced to camp.<br />
<br />
I guess it is always hard the first time, but oh...I felt terrible cause my macro was off, and I was stressed; it is so hard being on the other side of the healing chain. <br />
<br />
I know I will do better next time, because one of the clerics in guild told me how she does her CH rotation, and I adjusted it accordingly. And I assume that having been thrown into the fire and survived somewhat, that it may not be as bad at times in the future.<br />
<br />
So those of you who are in raiding guilds.... how was your first time? And please tell me it gets better?</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Take a deep breath and relax hun . My first  serious raid was awfull :( and my second and my third lol<br />
<br />
I started off in a guild where the kael arena was a serious raid to us . When my guild  disbanded and I was forced out into the world (hehehe) I found a wonderfull guild . The first raid I went on with them I didnt know how to make a macro , didnt know what a rot button was . I asked our HC and she explained to me how to make my hot key , I was so proud and the first raid went well . I knew how to make a hot key but not  a rotation hot key . Well it was a simple raid for my new guild but it impressed the hell out of me . <br />
<br />
The next raid we went on was a Dragon raid , Klandicar. So our HC asks us to make sure our macro r gtg and we have out rot key and cheal failed keys rdy and so on she mentions a feared macro so i make a new hotkey saying " 3 3 3 Feared " feeling all proud of myself. <br />
Well needless to say a macro and a hot key r 2 different things ( this i know now) So we start the fight and i get feared and i am trying to hit my hot key like a freak and it keeps telling me i cant do that right now . So I start freaking out and telling my hubbie what is going on , I ask him " why would she tell me to make a hot key when they dont work ? I am getting upset as i feel like a fool and on my second rotation with this guild i am messing up  like a total idot lol. <br />
That raid taught me the difference between a macro and a hotkey and now when i look back to it i laugh my ass off. At the time tho i was so upset feeling like a bad cleric . <br />
<br />
The next raid i was gona show them i wasnt a fool just, new to this world of mobs that fear u and well r way tuffer then anything u find in kael arena lol. <br />
<br />
Well grummus was our next target and I was shaking in my boots . We get there set up grps and they call for us to start our buffs . I am buffing but not really watching health bars as we r safe and buffing . Well one member of my grp starts getting hit and his life is at 90ish and dropping very slowly . I look up and see a shammy wincing and the name at a fast glance looks just like the guy who is in my grp and is getting hurt. I figure he is the shammy and just feeding so i toss him a cel and keep buffing. Next thing i know he goes from full life to dead faster then i can target him and heal . Turns out he is a monk and was starting to pull to clear but only said so in pull channel so i didnt see it. Also turns out the wincing one was his room mate and they did have the same name almost just changed 1 letter . So the monk is kinda mad at me as he doesnt know me at all , I am just new member number 00005 at this point. This upset me even more and i wanted to find a rock and hide under it .<br />
<br />
I found the tension and stress i put on myself made me make mistakes i normally wouldnt have made. I felt like a totally bad cleric and told my husband that i was going to swich either mains or guilds as i wasnt a good enough cleric to play in the planes. I thought i had better just put away my ress clicker and learn to play a class that i could get really good at .  I had been told that I was an awesome cleric most of my game life. This whole feeling like i sucked was totally new and i didnt know how to deal with it. My husband encouraged me to stick with it and give it a chance.  He reminded me that playing a cleric wasnt always easy for me and i had to learn every new phase as it came . When I got cheal I thought it was a awfull spell as i had to wait so long to cast it i was so sure the person would die before i got it off.  In time I learned how to use cheal and it became my main heal. I learned how to use cheal and i learned how to be a raiding cleric. <br />
<br />
At first it was hard and scared me , but the reason it scared/upset me is that i wanted to learn and be an uber cleric. I will admit when something is out of my ability and i watch some clerics and am amazed by them . I know I may not be the best cleric on my server but i do a great job and i am told so by my raid leaders/guild leader and HC. Just like everything else that is new to u there is an adjustment. Once u go thru that phase u will find one of 2 things imo :<br />
<br />
1. u learn how to be a good raiding cleric and love it <br />
2. u learn how to be a good raiding cleric and decide it isnt for u<br />
<br />
I bet after u have a few raids under your belt u r going to love it. <br />
<br />
I went from feeling just like u to loving raids <br />
<br />
Your choice to play a cleric says allot about who u r as a person to me . And the fact that u had been thrown into the fire and survived tells me  that it may not be as bad at times in the future <br />
(kinda quoted u there hehe). This is just another stage of playing another style of cleric for u to learn . Once u figure out your grove so to speak i am betting u will fall in love with the kaos that is a raid LOL. <br />
<br />
Do your self a favor and ask tons of questions from other clerics in ur guild. Not durring a raid maybe as they might be busy ,but after a raid when the questions r fresh in ur mind. I am sure they wont mind filling u in on anything u need to know . Even if u r used to raiding every guild still has their own raid rules and strats they want u to follow, so even a cleric who raids every night will have to learn a bit when joining a new guild. In my guild our HC likes us to have all our hot keys look the same :<br />
<br />
3 3 3 3 3 Cheal inc to  -%T- next is cleric number 4 ( name of cleric number 4 here)<br />
<br />
there are also other things she likes a certin way and only time spent raiding with the guild and speaking to my fellow clerics can teach me that stuff. <br />
<br />
We were all new to raiding at one time and some of us will be new to raiding with a certin guild again. It is all just a learning process and once u r comfy with it then u can decide if u truly enjoy raiding or not. <br />
<br />
hmm its late and i am sleepy so this might not make sense, but basically i am saying stick with it . Raiding  gets a whole lot more fun after u adjust  to the new style of playing a cleric:)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hehe ya I can relate. I was unguilded until level 65, no raids or anything other than pickup groups along the way.<br />
<br />
Does your guild use /pause macros or manual count ? <br />
<br />
/pause macros: You set up a macro with a /pause in it for CH. When you see your name, you hit the button and the macro makes you start your CH in X seconds.<br />
<br />
manual count: You have a CH + Heal macro like in a normal exp group, only with a soandso next attached to the end. When you see your name, you wait X seconds and then start your CH.<br />
<br />
Seems a little unclear from your post what your guild uses. If your guild uses /pause macros then they should have helped you set it up, maybe they just assumed you had one. Otherwise if they used manual counting with a heal message they should have explained how the timing involved.<br />
<br />
The toughest thing is probably that you didn't have a clue what to ask, and they assumed you were fine. Raids really are very different, instead of 1 cleric keeping 1 group alive it's many clerics mainly keeping your raid main tank alive, and a few healers patch healing as needed. The pressure often is a lot higher as your missed CH could wipe the raid, but that's all part of it. Nothing beats taking down something you were sure the raid was going to die to, but pulled it off anyways.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73"><font color="skyblue">My first (and only) CH rotation experience was also in Kael.  I was fortunate enough to have experienced healers (clerics and a druid) that were willing to take someone new to the rotation (me) and walk me through it before the raid got underway.  They made sure I was in the right chat channel for the healers, and then we tested our macros to see how much lag was factoring in.<br />
<br />
I may be spoiled, since I'm currently batting 1,000; it can only go downhill from here, right?  Seriously, though, don't be so hard on yourself.  You obviously care enough to want to figure out what went wrong and how it can be fixed.  Those are both good qualities to have.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My first CHeal rotation was manual count. I forget who the target was. Went just fine, but we <i>always</i> spend a few minutes before things gear up setting rotation, discussing how we will do it, and going through a few dry runs.<br />

It wasn't until probably my 6th raid that we had some cleric come along and <i>insist</i> we use a /pause rotation. He had just joined an Alliance guild after leaving an UberL33t(tm) Guild, and of course, us backwater clerics couldn't possibly know what a CHeal chain was or how to count...<br />
He also stressed when he learned that not just one, but <i>two</i> of us were 2boxing our clerics! OMG! Because, ya know, it takes all your concentration to watch for your name, count to 4, then hit a button!<br />
<br />
We didn't have the heart to tell him that one of the boxed clerics was also the MA...</td>

Don't remember too much of hte second one.  But the third one it was a doozie.  It was in Chardok while going for singed scroll for my epic and someone had triggered Historian Selrin - a level 68 or so mob that sits in the Prince room.<br />
<br />
After losing the MA twice to this bad boy we decidd to do a 3 sec cheal chain.  Did a couple dry runs and got set in the pull spot.  Then puller goes down and raid leader yells Charge and off we going running up to the mob.  Well MA is too low by time first cheal hits and goes down kinda quick, we switch to SA and hold our own for a bit with some timely patch heals from druids and shammy.  SA goes down switch to FA (final assist) and as last tank dies and clerics go oom, the mob drops.  I am still such a rookie on cheal chains but learning .</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Vindi was my first CH rotation too and it was really nerve-racking at the time.  Thankfully, the others were really helpful and talked me through how to set up my hotkey and what it was all about.  No major disasters as I recall but then there was probably some heavy patching going on at the time of my cast just in case - hehe.<br />
<br />
I did find CH rotations really stressful at first - my husband used to laugh becasue I couldn't eat becasue of the worry I'd mess it all up.  But pretty soon it became natural and fun to do.  And it was a real honour when the head cleric asked me to organise and start rotations to cover when she was off - even tho that can mean being the first person dispatched back to bind point in a hasty fashion if done wrong.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I took about 3 months off in the middle of this year and when I came back to EQ and raiding again, I felt the same as I did for my very first CH rotation.  Again thats worn off now and I'm right back to enjoying myself again )</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The first time you're in a heal rotation is nerve wracking.. To know that the fate of the raid and whether or not the other 30-80 people with you waste their evening rests firmly in your hands(not so true if the other clerics are good) is very intimidating.. It will take some time to get used to it but once you do it's very rewarding.. <br />
<br />
As clerics we get both ends of the stick.. When it all goes wrong we tend to get blamed, sometimes even if it was because a bard gated a mob!! When it all goes right everyone pours on the praise.. Just look forward to the higher level encounters where you're in a tight rotation, and have to maintain that rotation for upwards of an hour (Hi Xegony!).. It's a very satisfying feeling to work together as a class to make these things happen.. Be it in time, doing rathe council, Vex Thall, or doing AoW, it all comes down to you..<br />
<br />
The nice part of this class is because of the amount of interaction with the other clerics in the guild you really do start to develope a close relationship with them.. It's a definate that of the people in my guild, I know the clerics the best.. I've known others longer, on the order of years in some cases, but I'm chatting and working with the clerics every day I'm on..<br />

I consider there to be no better class to play in the end game of EQ.. If I was any other class I would have quit long ago..</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">LOL my first heal cycle, I lead it. Talk about nerve-racking. I went on an open raid on the Behemouth in PoI. I got there set up with my group and then proceeded to ask if we had a heal channel. They made a heal channel, like the thought had never occured to them before, and then once we were inside proceeded to vote me in as HC. I argued and argued with them that I haven' done this before and someone with experience should lead this. It was a big circle so finally i agreed, if they would help. So i set up the order, helped them make hot key, did like 5 dry runs, and made them set up a hot key that said, "I'm stunned, next cleric (their name) you are up!" I was finally feeling better about my HC status and I knew that unless one of them freaked out (or myself) that we'd be good. But, we ended up having to use that stunned hotkey a lot, (like a whole rotation of it)because the enc let the spiders through and we all died within a rotation... <br />
I was scared out of my wits, but it was a good experience. I know once i'm in a guild that has a HC thhat know's what they are doing and I'm not leading them I'll be ok. But, that was one of the scariest things ever.</td>

I read up on CH rotations and stuff and had a macro set up bet never used. My guild likes to do manual counts, and personally i think this is the best tactic.  All i can say is when we started the event and like 12 worms spawned and like there was 5 offtanks it was pretty cools. Also ive found that Its best to pay close attetion to the tanks health and The dmg output of mob, cause if the tank is like full health right before you CH you should duck. When i first started being in rotations I would just cast anyways and well thats kind of silly, but now i like can last a lot longer in rotations. Ch rotations is all abouts gettin the first CH off in time and paying attetion to rage ehe h. other then that its cake.</td>

One thing that I have found to be invaluable is having multiple casts in your ch hotkey to make up for fizzles, your spell gems not ungrayed yet, etc. <br />
We use simply /auction CH =====%t===== no pauses, no your name next, just a list of who's in the chain and it's up to us to pay attention and know the timing, our turn, etc.<br />
We use /auction because of the tendency of chat channels to go down.<br />

Over time it becomes second nature, pretty boring, and just wait til you meet Xegony and have to chain for almost an hour straight:,(  By that time you'll have it down. Also helps to have a crazy italian screaming at you hilariously in the cleric channel when you screw up as well :)</td>

So true.<br />
<br />
I think I like sullon zek because of the lack of population. With so few people here, we arn't nobodies. Everyone in the high end guilds is know by everyone else. Your not just another <hate> member, your Sohyru, one of <Hate>'s clerics. You own these zones, you obviously can play your class if you have gotten them where they are. You are feared and worshiped, you are spited and praised. I love being a cleric on Sullon Zek.<br />
<br />
So much depends on you on riads. Clerics are one of the MOST detrimental class to have there. No more important than any other class, but more critical. Especially whenyoru in a cheal cycle. When your called for that, the pressure is on. If your off by even a second it can cause the guild the raid provided you don't have good backup padders. That is the sad part of Sullon, we don't have the quantity and are often left with JUST ENOUGH clerics to handle a mob, with no mistakes. We don't have druids or Paladins to help, we have shamens, but so few of those they are usually soley involved in curing/slowing/debuffing. It all comes down to your heal.<br />
<br />
There is so much stress involved in a Cheal cycle. Most people ive tlaked to wouldnt play a cleric soley because of that stress and importance placed on them. I mean, cycling for an hour, hitting a hotkey every 12 seconds for an HOUR!? Who wants to deal with that? But once it is done, once it is over, when the mob finally dies and the last cheal hits it is one of the most rewarding things. I wouldn't trade my job for anything. <br />
<br />
Sure you get all kinds of bullshit when the tank dies. Sure you get blamed wether its your fault or not, but who cares, you know you did your job, and you did it well. When you win it is >>> than any spite you may have gotten earlier in the night for not winning. When you loose and you know what went wrong, you learn and move on. <br />
<br />
My first cheal cycle was hellish. I'm this baby lvl 59 cleric who doesn't  have a clue about raiding any mobs that would need cycling. I don't even know what cycling is! From the way people talk about it it seems like this horribly hard thing to do. I don't want to ask how to do it because I am with Vindictive (second best guild on server at time) and I don't want to look like a fool. Thankfully I wasn't the only cleric there who didn't know, and I didn't have to be the goat that asked. <br />
<br />
After hearing that all you had to do was count seconds and hit a hotkey saying something, it seemed almost too easy. Sure I've ****ed up cycling, had bad keys, missed heals, hit the wrong hotkey, but everyone has. I don't care how stuck up, snotty, perfect a cleric thinks they are, they have ****ed up at some point. Don't feel bad. Were only <insert race here>. You will get better, you will get used to it, and you will feel rewarded. Nothing is better than seeing a mob fall down infront of your face and knowing "hey, without me, this wouldn't be dead, we would all be cring, we wouldnt have this cool loot"<br />

<br />
My first CH rotation was on Doomshade.  Yeah, I know, not very old content, but my cleric was my third 50+ character since Kunark was released.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow.. DS is an unslowable mob with a LOT of HP that flurries and basically is a pain.  He's similar to Vindi, but probably has more HP overall as he is in Luclin.   I think during the first rotation, I lost my target because I wasn't used to the raid window and clicked on someone else while it was up on my screen.  I also died and felt pretty embarissed about that as somehow I got either too close to DS or healed and just the right time to somehow get aggro.  If DS rampages, it's possible I got rampage aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyhow.. since then I've become a 90% raid-class cleric.  I now enjoy the thrill of the CH chain and the dependence the raid has on our team of healers.  I took great pride in those many DS raids (the guild I was in at the time tackled DS as much as possible for his loot and the excitement) that we can out unscathed because we had a solid team (with druids as well, since the guild was cleric-poor).<br />
<br />
My most recent exciting battle was with Saryrn in Plane of Torment.  It was a rather long fight and I died twice during the rotation (again, I believe I got rampage aggro, I believe she AE rampages).  Both times I was res'd in, rebuffed, mana dumped from necros and jumped back into the rotation to finish her off.  It was very exciting and I was proud of the way everyone got me back in there and how the other clerics compensated when a team member had dropped.  Our latest fight with Agnarr was similar, but mostly in length of the battle and endurance.  I believe that battle was on the longest I've been in.<br />
<br />
CH chains still make me a bit nervous, especially since lately I've been leading them or being the first to cast (there's always the worry that you'll be dead in 2 seconds after it lands).  Now, with the plethera of strategies used on PoP mobs, being a raid cleric is awesome.  Ch chains, celestial regen chains, spam fights where you can be totally outside an AE range.. it's all good to me.<br />
<br />
Another excellent battle was Terris Thule..  At the point she debuffs, it's just the cleric chain and the main tank in the dome with her!  It's kinda freaky to be sitting there just about alone with Terris, waiting on her debuff whlie the other 40 people of your raid force is outside the dome.  I've got a few cool screenshots of our healing team in that scenario.<br />
<br />
I agree with whoever said that's how you find out what kind of cleric you enjoy being.  I like playing a cleric so much that most of the stress of playing one has fallen away.  I used to freak out big time and feel guilty when things went wrong, but now that I am more confident as a raid and avid planes grouper, I know that is someone croaks, I either blatantly wasn't paying attention, or there was no way to save that person within the parameters of my healing powers ;)</td>

I am not in a raiding guild & I hate raiding, but occassionally our alliance likes to run around & slaughter random stuff & tonite was one of those nites.  I reluctantly agreed to set up the chain & thank God for the raid leader answering my questions lol.  I was so nervous being in charge of something like that b/c i'm not used to it.  I think maybe i've been in 5 or 6 heal chains since i've been big enough to raid so needless to say I didn't know too much of what to do other than setting up the order & making sure other healers had their messages set up right.  It certainly helped to have someone that was familiar with the mob to help me get the pauses set up, etc tho.  And for leading my first CCH, we lost our tank right when my heal landed & the baddie died.  I was so glad that the chain went well & was so proud of myself for being able to get everyone organized, etc.  lol I know that's not much to be proud of, but for me it felt so good.  Never be afraid to ask questions if you're not sure, lol that's what helped me tonite  :)</td>

Velktor, our guilds first attempt, and first "big hp mob", AND "first guild CH rot".  Yeah, that was.....stressful.  But we got it the second time (wiped due to all healers being oor when he went behind the throne).<br />
<br />
After that, I dabbled in it here and there, getting a little but not great experience at it.  Until I decided to leave my current guild (friendly guild that only raids about 4 times a month, very casual), to join a bigger, higher calibur raiding guild.  That was about a week ago actually.  So was told by my friend in the guild (former guildmate of mine) to raid a few times with them, to get to know them and let the know me.  So along comes saturday, I ask if they want a cleric to come along.  "Sure, come to BoT safe room".  Ok, no problem, I was actually in a group in BoT at the time so pretty short run ;) .  So....we doing a tower or something?......No, Agnarr.<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
So of course I'm put into the rot, getting pretty excited.  We get to him finally, and start the rot.....and it goes......and it goes.....part of the way through I was able to calm down and even relax a little.  The heal team (me included) handled it like champs, only a few minor deaths on the named spawns.  Felt really good to be part of that, even if it did take, what, 40 mins of CH rot straight?  I lost track, might've been more.<br />
<br />
I had been getting bored with my cleric, until deciding to join them.  Now I'm getting that thrill again, that tension of life balancing in your hands (ha ha sounds evil, but I'm a human cleric).  The raid really does rely on the healers, as they can directly cause a wipe with just a tiny slip up.  Just remember, when you DO make a mistake and slip up, don't get down on yourself, even the best clerics and guilds have failures.  It's what you do AFTER you fail that shows what kinda person/guild you are.</td>

<br />
I went to the Red Wings game and got online around 10:30pm est. My guild is in Plane of Earth and has just killed the croc and they are getting ready to do a named which I believe was the trigger for the Arbitor. Anyway, I'm late, they are deep in the zone so I run as far along the wall as I can, tap a mob on the shoulder and die like a good cleric late for a raid should. /consent guild_rogue_001 and send /tell to same rogue giving location of corpse. Get dragged, rezzed, buffed and I 'm gtg. Now I have been the cleric to start just about every rotation we have done in the past 2 months. Last night, however, since I was late and the rotation was already established, I was put in the rotation, replacing a cleric that needed to log in the middle since our cleric officer did not want to mix up the rotation they had been using all night. The hardest thing for me to do last night was to keep my finger off the "1" button on my keyboard until it was my turn. I had to laugh at myself as I kept repeating, "do not start this rot...do not start this rot" :,( <br />
<br />
We attempted arbitor for the first time last night, but on the pull somehow he got stuck underneath the world and after several attempts to get him out for what seemed forever...the chicken got scared and despawned. ;(</td>

<br />
True that of course, even the best of clrs heals sometimes get messed up =/ and I have watched that bar drop and watch my CH cast, and think "come on baby go go come on cast cast...only a few seconds left go go go - then "woops"  Sometimes you just think it will make it, and it doesn't...then you think, wtf where were those druids....am I the only one here?? lol hehe  Sometimes I think I got it, and for some reason the tank all of a sudden takes a major hit, and if its like say an LDON group, I just duck out and cast SR and then CH...On a raid, usually no reason at all to stop your CH because the other clrs are watching that MA and so are the druids and by god someone needs to throw in a patch!<br />
<br />
I find that there is nothing boring about being a Clr, I love it, and I would  never ever play any other class, except maybe every once in a while (bout once every 2 months or so) I jump on an alt and go kick some wee mobs around.<br />

I like to play a game when grouping with friends, I like to see how low thier health can get before I really need to heal, sometimes I say, "Oh hey, yell if you need a heal, I am reading a book k thnx" but its all in good fun.<br />
