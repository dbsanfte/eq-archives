The only problem with playing on someone elses server is that they do not have the bandwith that Sony has to accomdate large numbers of players so you get disconnected frequently. Also, most of the emulated servers don't have all the zones enabled. EQ is run on literally dozens if not hundreds of servers and no individual running an emulated version is going to be able to match that, so playing on an emulated server is going to suck anyway.</td>

The real problem lies in the fact that some of these programs allow you to explore all the zones without any mobs in them, thus no risk, and can sometimes permit you to discover things about the game that you may not otherwise have access to. That's why it's illegal, and that's why it's considered cheating and exploiting.</td>

You might want to consult with a copyright lawyer on this one.  A EULA is <b><i>exactly</i></b> a legal contract.  Why SOE hasn't "already sued IGE into the ground" would be a question you would have to take up with them, but they would certainly have very strong grounds to do so, if they wanted to spend the money and effort on it.</td>

The only reason they have not gone after IGE, Yantis, etc. is it would be too cost prohibitive at this point. They stand little to gain from it so they don't bother. They tolerate it and try to keep it as limited as possible. All high end items being NO DROP, using adventure points as a new form of currency, introducing things such as the casino and establishing a tribute points system to suck plat and droppable items out of the economy are all things they are doing to limit the cheaters.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, not to jump on the contraband bandwagon, but EULA's are truly just for show, and don't stand up outside of the wee fantasy world (especially not in a court of law).  The only case that has made it to court was in Japan, where the judge held that the time a player puts into a game is his own intellectual property and has a right to it.  The reason Sony doesn't sue Yantis is that they don't believe it would be upheld in a court of law (theres also a rumor that some company bought out Yantis for a few million). So from a legal standpoint you are homefree<br />
<br />
From a moral standpoint, if you are just using this to run around and play--to see zones and summon cool junk in your own world, I don't see anything wrong with it.  Now if you are tampering with actual gaming and other people's experience, thats bad and bannable.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, okay...if we're actually going to devote some time to this topic, let me backtrack just a bit on my previous statement.  I'll grant you that the legality of a EULA is debatable, but <b><i>only because there has not yet been an actual EULA case taken to court</i></b>.  Literally, none of the owners of the software in question has sued somebody who has been caught violating the EULA (interestingly, though, there is currently a <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-983988.html" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> making its way through the California court system, where a woman is sueing Symantec because she bought Norton, took it home to install, <b><i>actually read the EULA</i></b> and disagreed with it, then was told by the store where she bought it that she couldn't return it, since she had opened the software...they're currently trying to get it classified as a class-action lawsuit, but that's a completely different funny story).  <br />
<br />
There are quite a few known cases of businesses being caught with pirated software on their networks, and those businesses have, without fail, bought the necessary licensing to keep from being taken to court.  All we're waiting for is a company to stand firm and dispute the legality of a EULA one of these days, and risk going to court to settle the question.  So far, their lawyers are telling them that's not a wise move.<br />
<br />
But, I'm curious as to what logic people are using to dispute the legality of a EULA.  You have a screen that appears in front of you that states (whether you read it or not) that you agree not to do certain things while using this copyrighted software.  Even if you wanted to play dumb and claim you never read it and don't know what it says, it's discussed often enough (just as we're doing now) that you know the meat and potatos of the agreement.  You know that it says you won't cheat, you won't buy in-game items for real-world money, you won't use emulators to change your character or its gear.  And you know that you click "I agree" to all of the above, every time you play the game.  So, what leap of logic are you using to argue against the legality of this, that I'm missing?</td>

That's not the main reason it's prohibited, in my opinion. I would guess that it's prohibited primarily because it would permit people to stop paying EQ's monthly fees and still play a version of EQ via privately-run "servers"... obviously not at all a good thing from their standpoint.<br />
<br />
While it might be fun to see what kind of variations would be possible if people could host their own versions of Norrath, I don't think any of them would be able to generate enough revenue to make it viable to maintain and support a full world (besides, unless they were required to pay licensing fees, it's a huge rip-off of the people who created the game to begin with).</td>

That's because SOE typically won't sue someone over it, especially if it's just a peson playing the game. If they catch you they WILL ban your account. No, there may not be examples of lawsuits, but there are plenty of examples of banned accounts. Violate the EULA and you risk being banned as well.</td>

This site does not condone breaking the EULA.  The reasons for that are moral ones:  In our opinion breaking the Everquest EULA, which you agree to every time you play the game, is wrong.  That has nothing to do with the law - it's purely about what we think is right.  <br />

Of course, it's perfectly legitimate to discuss whether the EULA is enforceable or not, and I see no reason why that part of the discussion can't continue.<br />

Sure they have.  I'm guessing here, but I'd say there've been hundreds (if not thousands) of accounts closed down by SOE due to violations of the EULA.  I personally know two people who were kicked from the game.<br />
<br />
But, you're missing the true purpose of EQ's EULA.  Yes, it does conceivably allow them to chase down people like IGE.  But Sony wouldn't necessarily have to take anybody to court over violations over their EULA (and obviously hasn't yet).  Their EULA also works along the lines of <b><i>protection</i></b> from anybody who tries to take <b><i>them</i></b> to court, after being booted from the game for a EULA violation.  Say they get sued because Johnny's mommy and daddy don't like that he got kicked out of the game for violating the EULA.  So, if they're dumb enough to actually take a civil suit to court over it, the appearance would last just about as long as it took Sony to introduce evidence showing what little Johnny did, and then a copy of the EULA, where Johnny agreed that he would be violating the rules if he did whatever they kicked him for.  <br />

Oh, believe me, there is such a penalty, used at the judge's discretion.  The problem is, it's incredibly rarely used.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">On the legality of the EULA, that will depend all on what type of mood the judge is in that day.  On the morality of emulators, to me that would be a personal dilema (spelling?) as no one can really tell you what is morally right or wrong as everyone has different beliefs.  I agree that for SoE to start a lawsuit it would be very hard to make it through as they have let countless others abuse.  On banning accounts I too have seen this, and I have also seen peeps blatently abuse exploits and such and got /petitioned and all and still were able to continue on.  Its a "what type of mood am I today" attitude with in human nature that makes it hard to say what would be done and what should be done.  <br />
<br />
On the emulators themselves, I believe as others have said that the possibility is there to examine zones easily and with out interuption to find exploits and such.  Other then that, there really isnt a reason to use them other then for fun.  Which in time would become boring for the lack of content and lack of person to person involvement which makes up MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
I personally don't condone the use of anything that is anti-EULA, but at the same time, I don't go out of my way to find people that do it.  The only way I feel that the EULA is being broken by using an emulator is that you are taking content created by/for EQ and using it for something else.  Other then that, it doesn't really break the EULA.  As another poster stated, SoE keeps all characters on there servers as a security measure against such as these.  So unless you are also planning on doing some hacking, then an emulator does you really no good (barring the before mentioned ability to search out exploits and such).  <br />
<br />
We can discuss this matter over and over as we all have different situations, friends and acquaintences, and read articles covering these and other topics on the EULA.  But the one thing we can all definately agree on, is that we all have different views and neither of us are totally wrong in our beliefs.  As we like to say on our guild rants boards we agree to disagree :p hehe.  <br />

<br />
Based on this logic, a murderer could certainly make moral justification for killing someone.  But that's not the point.  We live in a country that has laws, and while these laws are based on morals (the morals of our forefathers, to be exact), they are NOT based on a moral system that changes with the population(except inasmuch as the federal courts "reinterpret" the laws).  If I kill someone and then claim it is moral, what difference does that make to anyone?  It's still ILLEGAL, and so I would still be punished.<br />
<br />
Homosexuality, on the other hand, while it is immoral in my eyes, is not illegal.  If two consenting adults of the same gender engage in sexual activity, they will not be persecuted in a court.<br />
<br />
Immorality and lawlessness are two very different topics.  One varies from person to person and so cannot be dictated between two belief systems.  The other varies only from country to country, and provides a "set standard" to regulate society regardless of the moral views of individuals.<br />

You fail to look at the big picture sir.  The statement is 100% correct.  In the whole world there are multiple beliefs due to religion, culture, and personal values.  Being in the military for multiple years (no need for ya to know how old I am :p ), I have been deployed and stationed in multiple countries.  Alot of third world countries do believe in killing and such and they do have a society that is not lawless.  Is it the type of society that we are used to??  Of course not as we are brought up differently.  Everquest is a game diverse of different cultures and countries that all come together to play this game.  Can you honestly say you have not grouped or raided with someone from a different culture then yourself?  Just in religions alone, there are as I call them "sects and cults" that do believe in certain types of killing as being just.  Not really sure of the exact terminology that should be used for them and I apoligize to any that might believe in such things as this is not a bash on any type of beliefs or religion.  Also, as was posted above, the Military, police, and government in a whole does believe in killing to a degree.  Yes, it is only in dire circumstances that it is approved on and they are trained to use it as a last resort only.<br />
<br />
I totally understand what you are saying, and as everyone on this thread has agreed, breaking the EULA is wrong.  Its the context of how extreme you place this and some of your arguements that are being taken into discussion and debate.  Your overall arguement is correct in that in America, without set laws (not morals and values) we would be a lawless society.  The morals and values of the government and "voting" public are what sets the laws and standards.  That is why democratic societies like America vote to make laws as everyone is raised with different cultures, religions, morals, values, and beliefs.  <br />
<br />
I do commend you for sticking to your values, as that is how things get done.  But, sometimes there has to be a comprimise in debates and such.  Not that I am saying personal values and morals should change, but that a compromise on the overall situation.  Again, I am not attempting to change your beliefs nor, am I trying to bash anyone on this or any thread.  I am attempting to show a different view is all.  Thank you</td>

By deeming it wrong, you have made a moral decision. Which is my point from earlier. You cannot argue the morality of something that breaks rules and/or laws. Whether you agree with a rule or law is a matter for debate. But whether you agree with a law(rule) or disagree with a law(rule), knowingly violating that rule or law is an immoral decision. When it comes to knowingly violating a rule or law, there is only one moral decision to make, and the moral decision is to follow the rule or law. Morality, in this case, is not open for debate. Agreeing/disagreeing with the rule or law is fine and can be debated, but as long as it is in place the only moral thing to do is follow it.<br />
<br />
I hope that clears up what I meant by my earlier post.</td>

I'm gonna have to nitpick and disagree with this one.  If there were a law (as there has been in the past) requiring me to bow down to a golden idol whenever certain music played (for example), the only "moral" thing to do, judging by my personal beliefs, would be to NOT obey the law.  I cannot, with my belief system, bow down to worship anyone or anything except for my God.  Therefore I would not only disagree with the law, I would (without violating my morals) refuse to follow it.<br />
<br />
Of course, this would still be *illegal* and I would certainly expect the punishment of the law to be forthcoming, regardless of the morality of my actions.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Yes I did make a moral judgement and say it was wrong.  Where on my post did I blatently state that I represent the whole world?  You can't as I never claimed to, nor is there any way that I might.  You did state that "I made the decision and can not dispute/argue that point" and your are not entirelly correct in that assumption.  I can do so as my right in America for free speech and my right with MY religion/beliefs of freedom of thought.  But that is now what we are discussing here my friend.  The disagreement that is here is "IS IT MORALLY WRONG AND/OR ILLEGAL TO UTILIZE AN EMULATOR".  And no it is not morally wrong to a person of a different background then you and I.  I do not dispute the fact that I totally agree with you on it being Immoral to "ME", but that it cannot be condoned as that for all.  Back home in Texas we have a word for people like that.  Let me give you an example on one of them.  "David Karesh" believed that everything had to be done exactly a certain way no matter what, which in turn caused the death of countless lives.  How do I know you may ask?  My home town is no less then 1.5 miles from where the compound was burnt to the ground.  I am in no way calling you a fanatic at all.  Just trying to prove a point is all.<br />
<br />
 Did I say it was illegal?  No, I did not.  I do not believe that breaking the EULA is breaking a law.  Why?  As I know you would definately ask.  The reason I say that is that in reality if it was a law, then people would get prosecuted for it. Has anyone??  Of course not.  Being banned is not taking legal action in one way or another.  It is the company using its rights to refuse service to someone for what ever reason they have.  All companies are entitled to this right as long as they do not break any prejudice or harassment laws.  So in turn, your arguement is flawed my friend.  There is NO law that states a EULA is binding in a court of law.  You might try and respond with the copyright laws, but again where in those laws does it state that if a user breaks the EULA they will encounter legal reprocusions?   They state that if you copy, steal, or even borrow other peoples/companies content/ideas you are breaking a law.  Now if we can get back to the original discussion my friend, is using an Emulator right or wrong?  IN MY EYES YES, but only as it breaks copyright laws as you have to utilize the content that Sony has the right to in a way it was not intended for.  That is illegal and DOES break laws.  Using an emulator breaking the EULA does not constitute being illegal.  End Users Licensing Agreement is an agreement to follow certain guidlelines set in place by Sony with the understanding that they have every right to ban/cancel your account for not adhering to those guidelines.  I am sorry my friend but Sony can try to take you to court for countless stuff against the EULA, but you will not see it come to that.  Now they could easily take you to court for breaking copyright laws if they chose too (unlikely to happen as they are in the business of making money) but they would have to be able to prove you used an emulator for that.  That is one of the reasons Yantis and all those other peeps are still around.  They are not stealing anything (well I hope they are not stealing accounts and such from innocent people).  They only sell items gained in game that is not illegal in any way.  They do break the EULA, and personally I think that is morally wrong.  Again I said personally.  If it was such an outrage to everyone, and was illegal, then why are they making millions of dollars?  How was IGE able to purchase Yantis's business for soo much?  Because it is not illegal in any way.  <br />
<br />
Now again, let me emphasize that I "DO" agree with you that to "ME" it is morally wrong.  But again I must state that you and I do not represent everyone in the world, nor do we follow every religion, belief, value, and thoughts as everyone.   THAT is the point I am trying to get across to you.  To claim that everyone MUST follow the same beliefs is wrong and unheard of in my beliefs and that of the Democratic Society.  And that my friend is why you are able to be here now voicing your concern and belief on this issue.  <br />
<br />
I do hope that this debate between you and I is not taken personally, nor as a bash towards you or your beliefs.  I respect what you think and believe in, but I can not personally agree with your logic.  In that we must agree to disagree.  <br />
<br />
I am glad that you haven't taken this to a flame session, and I must say that you have responded in the utmost respect in all of your postings on this thread.  This is how I wish all boards were in how they debate certain issues and such.  To that I bow before you and the rest of the EQCleric community as you all have continued to maintain the highstandards that should be maintained on all boards.  /bow   I only say that as on a different board I frequent (not anymore mind you), a topic was discussed like this, and it turned real ugly.<br />

No offense taken. I think we are in agreement for the most part, and that the disagreement is more how we each define things than anything. Your talk of law in this case is a misinterpretation. Which is why in my previous post I used the term "rule or law". I was speaking more in general terms, not specifically this case as it refers to the EULA.<br />
<br />
Let me break it down another way. Say we are playing Monopoly. There are certain rules of the game. If one of us knowingly violates the rules (cheats) we are making an immoral decision.<br />
<br />
We are looking at morality from 2 different points of view, and you are mixing religion and belief systems into it, which can cause flaws in logic. Morality "should" be looked at strictly from a philisophical and logical standpoint. <br />
<br />
To somewhat use Commence's post a bit: If you have certain religious beliefs that go against adhering to a particular law, one of two possibilities exist. Either the law is flawed, or your religious beliefs are. Yes, you can find examples of laws that are not followed based on religious beliefs, however, disobeying a law that is immoral is actually following a logical system based on moral code to actually do what is moral. When I gave my examples earlier I was going under the assumption that the rules or laws were moral, and was hoping everyone would follow that assumption without giving examples to the contrary. I was arguing from a point of view of trying to keep it simple without complex examples. I guess I should have explained it better and said "moral laws or rules, not laws or rules with flaws in logic/morality"<br />
<br />
The opposite side of the coin is using religious beliefs that are immoral to justify breaking a law or rule that IS moral/logical. An example would be a cult that believes murder is okay. That is their belief, but their belief is immoral, so violating the law is immoral as well. Just because something is someone's religious belief, does not make it moral.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: This is Sony's game. They own it. The EULA is a set of rules for that game. If you choose to play their game, the only logical/moral decision to make is to follow those rules. Knowingly violating them, no matter what your belief system, is an immoral decision. If you disagree with their rules, the only logical/moral decision to make is to not play the game.<br />
<br />
Holy smokes, now I'm in the mood to read "Atlas Shrugged" again. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">There seems to be some confusion between what is referred to as a "tort" or what is an infraction of the criminal code. <br />
<br />
A tort is a break of contract law rather than criminal law. If you are an adult and you agree to a contract and then break the contract, you could be held liable for damages as a result of your consequences. <br />
<br />
I really believe that most of us understand that we have formed a contract with SOE when we log on. The length of the agreement, the inconvenience of reading such agreement is not likely an arguement for defence that would hold up in any Western court of law especially Canada, Britain and the US. That is because our case law commons from a common source. <br />
<br />
However, SOE would have to prove in court how they were harmed as a result of your actions and also put a dollar figure on the the damages resulting from that breech of contract. <br />
<br />
When you look at the amount we pay on a (usually monthly) basis to SOE, the damages for a regular player would not be that much. Consequently, SOE will generally only bann the player from playing. The costs of pursuing court actions would far out strip any possible settlement. <br />
<br />
But there are parrells to the down loading of music from the Internet. In certain select cases, the music industry has selected certain "victims" to pursue in court. Though the amounts per conviction are very small, the thought process is to put fear into everyone else and stop them from downloading music. <br />
<br />
So, in theory they could very well select out certain players for "punishment" and sue them. And likely would be successful. Ignorance of the law is never a very strong defence arguement.</td>

<br />
The EULA would more likely be used to protect SOE from being sued. If SOE was ever sueed by a customer whose account they banned, their primary line of defense will be the database showing the amount of times the plaintiff in the suit clicked "I accept" while the EULA was displayed at login.</td>

<br />
emulators are not against the EULA (been awhile since i actually read it so they might have tossed it in later)....  emulators mean absolutely nothing to Sony... emulators only give you the zones, they do not give you the mobs or the items... some of the old mobs have been "released", but at the most, it is 2-3 expansions behind.. and no tradeskills.. those have to be programmed by the person running the emulator, which is next to impossible to do unless you have whole departments like sony... you cannot move your charatcer to or from an emulator to one of Sony's servers... so Emu's are totally unrelated to anything dealing with Sony's EQ<br />
<br />
i have played Emu's.. it's like playing super mario bro's on the old nitendo with all the codes in todays world.. an old game that is no challenge whatsoever that you get bored after insta killing the third mob<br />
<br />
EULA are not a sword but a shield for a company.... companies do not have EULA to go after people, but to protect themselves when they ban people that have broken the rules... without an EULA, any bannings could result in a lawsuit, but with an EULA, the company says "we said not to do those things or you would be banned.. and we warned them not to do it before they ever played the game".. <br />
<br />
the norton lawsuit is a joke because an EULA has nothing to do with the stores return policy concerning opened software... if the lady had called symantec direct, they would have refunded her the money without question<br />
<br />
sony does not care about Yantis (who was bought out by IGE, btw), they only care if bugs or exploits are used to get the items or plat.. two different issues.. EULA just protects sony from being sued when people get ripped off buying characters, items or plat...</td>
