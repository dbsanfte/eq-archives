<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">After wandering amazed through the twisting hallways of the Plane of Justice, I found Tamyna Willowsong lying on a bed in a cell at the end of a hallway.<br />
<br />
Your Location is 277.34, 115.37, -1.25<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Tamyna Willowsong'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong gives a solemn nod in recognition of Varalla, though her features are wrought with an unfathomable sorrow, 'Shhh, friend. The prisoners are not to speak here. If we are caught, we will be placed in solitary confinement, and I do not think that I would be able to endure that torment again. Nevertheless, your presence is comforting. It has been a long time since I have had another show any interest in me.' The Fier'dal's face gains a strange light of wonder for a moment, 'Perhaps you would wish to hear my tale and grant a brief moment of release from this torture?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I would like to hear your tale.'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong smiles gently, though the sorrow on her features almost sting at your heart, 'I'm grateful for it, friend. I was not always a prisoner and was once a being of goof heart a faith. A bard of Erollisi Marr, I traveled Norrath in hopes of spreading joy and hope to all of its citizens. During my travels, my own heart was graced with Erollisi's passions in a most unfortunate and tragic circumstance.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What tragic circumstance?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'I was visiting the city of Freeport, delivering one of my many tales to the people in the Theatre of the Tranquil. As I finished my tale, the most handsome man I had ever seen approached me. He gave praise to my tale and song and offered to walk with me a while through the Commonlands beyond. He claimed that he was enchanted and could not rest the night without being witness to my talents further, for my tales and voice struck his heart and spirit like no other. I was immediately enchanted with the half-elven gentleman and took his hand. Seemingly, it was a joyful man that led me through the calm Commonlands. I serenaded him with my lute and voice, all the while giving the glorious tales of Norrath's most notable legends. When the night turned to dawn and the sands of Ro were at our feet, he returned me to the city and our company parted at the bard's guild that housed me throughout my stay there. This meeting would change my life.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'How did the meeting change your life?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'The handsome man, who revealed his name to me as Tarraul, returned for each of my shows and each night for the three weeks that I remained in Freeport, we spent together. I had fallen in love with the man -- more passionately and truly than I believed my heart possible. He claimed to return the same feelings for me, having brought gifts of single flowers upon each night that we met. I thanked Erollisi silently, for never in my deepest fantasies had I dreamed that such a love was possible. The final eve before my return to the isle of Erollisi in the Ocean of Tears, Tarraul proposed but it was not a moment of joy for me, for he held a condition -- a choice that tore me apart.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What choice?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'Tarraul requested that I forfeit my place amongst the sister of Erollisi and join him solely in the city of Freeport. He claimed that he could not bear to be without me, should I be his bride, and that my dedication to the sisters would have us in needless separation. I asked if he would join me on my ventures around Norrath, but he declined, for Freeport was his home and his obligations resided there. I returned to the isle of Erollisi without an answer to my love's question. For a week I sat in thought and wonder, questioning my faith for the first time. How could I be given this gift of love -- so pure and whole in my entirety, but yet be asked to remove myself from that which had brought us together? I eventually made a decision, one that I would regret for the rest of my short life.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What was your decision?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'I found Erollisi to be a cruel goddess whose followers were naive. I could not understand how the goddess of love would place one of her followers on a path of choice between the two guiding passions in their lives. I left the isle in fury, rudely denouncing my faith in the Queen of Love and forever removing myself from the order. I returned to Freeport and my love that eve. We were married the following week in a small, private ceremony performed by one of Tarraul's dear friends. It wouldn't be for another three years before I would discover exactly what I had done.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What had you done?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'One eve, a knock came upon our door. Tarraul and a fellow merchant were occupied at the time, engaged in affairs of business. I answered the door and to my surprise, two paladins from the Temple of Marr were at our door. They exclaimed that they wished to speak with my husband. Surprised and confused, I allowed them in and questioned their reasoning for coming to our home so late. They looked upon me with pity and expressed their remorse in having to reveal the truth of my husband to me in this fashion, but they had no choice. I was so confused and demanded to know why they were in my home. Tarraul had come down the stairs and the knights, pushing me aside, drew their blades and ordered that he go with them. My husband looked at me, a sly grin upon his face -- one that I had not seen in the years that I had known him. A split moment and all was rent. It would be too late before I discovered the 'truth' the paladins had spoken.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What truth?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'My husband did something I had not thought him capable of in the past -- he reached out his arms in a graceful arcane motion and uttered an incantation. The three of them were immediately engaged. I was confused, and concerned for my love's safety. I did not think clearly at that moment and drew my rapiers from their proper place upon the wall and joined my husband's side. It would work, somehow, that both paladins would fall to my blades and in the end, Tarraul would stand, smirking with an immeasurable sense of pride and a wicked light to his face that I shall never forget. He then took me upstairs and helped me wash the paladin's blood from my hands. My clothes were disposed of and my weapons polished. He spoke not a word to me, despite how I questioned him. Only the light of dark pride filled his eyes. The paladin's bodies were disposed of before I had finished cleaning up. Frantically, I demanded answers of my husband and finally, he gave them to me.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What was his answer?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'I asked him why the paladins sought him and why his reaction was so brash and violent. He smirked at this and revealed something that should have torn me a part then, but had no effect. The half-elven man I had known for three years disappeared and in his wake, stood a Teir'Dal. He was an enchanter and an aid to the Dismal Rage and Sir Lucan D'Lere. He said he was proud of me, that the actions I was so quick to perform had surprised and intrigued him most deeply. I loved him still, for I cared not what race he was -- I still do not care. I could not see past his lies and deceit and I agreed to help him dispose of the paladin's bodies. We returned to our house and the last thing I remember was a muttered word and then darkness. I awoke in the prison beneath the Temple of Marr three days later. I never did see my husband again. The paladins would deliver unto me the short path that had dictated the rest of my short existence.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What short path?'<br />
Tamyna Willowsong says 'A priestess of Erollisi Marr entered my cell. She was aware of my former beliefs and allegiance to the Queen of Love and sought to save me. She did not blame me at that time, for she believed I was a victim. I strongly disagreed with her assumptions. I told her that I acted on my own conscience and accord -- that the blade that struck down their knights was true and whole in its conviction. I did not regret what I had done, for I saved the life of my only love. How dare they make light of the emotion Erollisi herself had granted to me. I saw then the hypocrisy of love and the reverence for it. I was in love with one who is considered a sworn enemy of my former beliefs and of my people, but my heart was true and I refused to denounce it. The priestess exclaimed that they could not judge me, for what had befallen my heart was within the ways of their path, but my acts were treacherous nonetheless. I was to be sent to a place of divine judgment -- blind to faith and the heart. That place is here, the Plane of J'<br />

<note that is how the conversation ended, i coudlnt' find another phrase to make her continue. Probably because i missed half the last sentence.></td>
