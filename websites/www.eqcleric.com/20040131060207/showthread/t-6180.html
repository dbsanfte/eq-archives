<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello All, did a search on this board for solo and was very disappointed by the lack of discussion.<br />
So, thought I'd start my own threat  :p <br />
<br />
Recently re-equipped my 62 cleric and decided to give it another go.  I really enjoy playing EQ with the wife, but it isn't much fun when we have to work to get groups going.  Her highest toon is a 63 chanter, so my cleric goes well with it.  We can get groups together in almost no time with these toons, so that is the positive.<br />
<br />
The down side though :(  ....   Sometimes I'm tired from work and politics.  During these moments, conversation isn't enjoyable to me.  But, I still very much enjoy the hunting end of the game, so I like to squeeze in an hour or two of soloing here and there.<br />
<br />
When I first created Olrest, I thought soloing might be possible with the new cleric improvements (hammer, damage shield, pet), but was extremely disappointed as I got closer to 65.  So, I quit a few months back and played another toon.  After a little break I decided that maybe I wasn't using the right strategy and was expecting too much.  I figured the only way to find out if a cleric can solo efficiently for exp, was to give it another earnest try.<br />
<br />
So, this week I've tried a few things and was pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
* Soloed a Stalker in PoN - Cost me all my mana and required a KEI, but was successful.  Not too dangerous.<br />
* Soloed several frogs in Old Sebelis.  About 1/2 are light blue, but seemed exp was decent and rarely used more than 10% mana per frog.<br />
* Soloed several mobs in Velks.  Some are easy (entrance undead mobs) and some are really tough.  Did have to gate once on a mob fairly deep in.<br />
<br />
Things learned.<br />
* Nuking is an inefficient thing to do.  Started this route, and found myself using way more mana than just straight up melee/heal.<br />
* Important to stay near the low end of mobs.  If a mob is more than 2 - 3 levels about Dark Blue, I get owned.<br />
* The procing hammer does a decent amount of damage.  I parsed a log from LDoN group other night and found that with hammer, I do 1/3 as much dmg as a well equipped warrior.  Not too shabby in my opinion.  During the coarse of a couple of battles, he did 12,000 dmg, while my melee + proc did 4,000.<br />
* Combine the hammer dmg/dly ratio + proc + pet + damage shield + plate class = decent solo tank. <br />
* Fights tend to last a long time.<br />
<br />
So, am I the only solo pioneer?  Anyone else solo a lot?  What have you guys run into?<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are plenty that have soloed.  Hopefully you will share some experiences and ask questions here.<br />
<br />
My Character<br />
62 Halfling Cleric with Zero AAs<br />
233 Wisdom with KEI<br />
1106 AC buffed<br />
780 Attack with Yaulp (not positive about this number, but close)<br />
120 Agility (I think this is an important solo stat, trying to raise it)<br />
220 Dex with Yaulp and Summoned Hammer<br />
3200 hp buffed with Virtue<br />
<br />
I believe with the right AA choices, I can probably solo for 70% of the exp I can get in a good group.  I'm thinking of getting these first.<br />
SCM3 (10% mana cost reduction)<br />
CS3 (10% damage mitigation)<br />
The avoidance one (can't remember the AA name, but increases chance of avoiding incoming blows)<br />
<br />
Anyway, thought I'd start there.  Besides working hard to get my AC up to 1400 (heard there is a soft cap), I'll be hitting the Tanking AAs.<br />
<br />
Would be very interested in some discussion on this topic.  Surely, I'm not the only one that doesn't enjoy grouping 24/7.</td>

I have tried and can usually get a couple mobs dead, but then I either get owned or have to gate.  I honestly don't think I have put forth an effort as you seem to have done.  Grats for sticking to it.  I personally went and started a Necro so I could solo on those slow days, or when I don't fell like being around peeps.  Hes catching up too.  :D currently lvl 57, need to play Kan a lil more me thinks. :p</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Solo constantly.. I enjoy the chalange. Havent soloed any planes mobs yet, though.  Soloed ToFS starting at lvl 48(?) using Dawnfire. <br />
<br />
My greatest solo achievement, at lvl 58, I soloed Allesaurs in OOT. Took me 31 minutes or letting that lezard chase me around the island as I build up mana to heal myself, then jump back in and start swinging hammer again, but Woot.. what fun.. got 2 snakescales for my trouble... hehe<br />
<br />
I made 50 and 51 one day in KC as MT for a caster group.  2 nights ago I was grouped with another cleric and a druid and we were holding down all the Necro spawns in Seb. I was MT for that group too. <br />
<br />
I have soloed the 3 spawns at the CE camp in Velks many times.. havent tried it since lvl 56, but I assume I could do more easily, with a few more kills added in.  <br />
<br />
Chardok is fun to solo, because you can pull a mob to the entrance by Herald Telchu(sp) and they wont run. They act like the herald is a mezzed mob.<br />
<br />
For discussion purposes though: I do not solo for xp pruposes. I do it for the challange and the fun.  Hint: You can stun mob, and either heal yourself, and retarget the mob or root it, before he starts swing at you again, usually.  hehe.. if they are stunable.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">You refer mostly to melee soloing.  At 62, one of your best options is probably root rotting; you've just got access to the Sermon of Penitence spell.<br />
<br />
<b>Root rotting technique</b><br />
<br />
Pick a monster which is undead and dark blue.  For the original poster, a good place to start would be Maiden's Eye, where the Vampyre Bats are dark blue to 62 but not tough enough to cause a serious problem.  You may find you need Wake of Tranquillity to single pull them.<br />
<br />
Root them with Paralyzing Earth (Petrifying Earth is better for a level 65 cleric) and then cast Epitaph of Life and Sermon of Penitence on them.  Refresh each spell when it wears off.  Repeat until you get xp.<br />
<br />
When doing one at a time gets trivial for you, try root rotting two at once.  ;)<br />
<br />
<b>Shadowfrost's guide to soloing for exp</b><br />
<br />
Don't. If you don't have time or attention to devote to a group, then as a cleric, you will not receive a meaningful amount of exp solo. <br />
<br />
<b>Shadowfrost's guide to soloing for loot</b><br />
<br />
Go to Chardok B. The hardest part about Chardok B is getting there. If you have decent faction with the sarnaks, then it's easy. If not, then here is the procedure:- <br />
<br />
a) Bind in BW outside Chardok. <br />
b) Get DA, DB, and BDA up. <br />
c) Drink a sow potion (can skip this if you are familiar with the route). <br />
d) Run to Chardok fort and DB. Call a train now. <br />
e) Run through the fort to the first bridge. Jump off the left side of the bridge. <br />
f) You'll land in a room containing a couple of slaves with one exit. Take the exit and turn immediately right. <br />
g) Follow the left hand wall from here. It's quite a long way. DB will wear off; DA the moment it does. <br />
h) Eventually you'll reach the door into the bank. Go through it and through the next door as well, still following the left hand wall. You'll emerge in an open area containing a lake and a waterfall. Keep left, keep going. <br />
i) Swim through the waterfall. Just past the waterfall on the left is a small alcove. In the alcove is a lever. Click the lever and you're in Chardok B. <br />
<br />
Once in Chardok B, you can pull monsters to the entrance room and solo them at your leisure. They'll produce a bit of +Chardok faction, some PP, and a tiny bit of exp. You can melee solo them or root rot them, either will work. <br />
<br />
All of the static-spawn undead are PH's for the Rabid Chokidai. Rabid Chokidai cannot be pacified or rooted (and if you're duoing them, you also need to know that they can't be snared and mitigate slow). They summon, so you can't root rot them; melee soloing is about your only choice. With maxed defensive AA and halfway decent gear, they're a fairly easy melee solo. <br />
<br />
Their common drop is a 6ac 40hp 40mana earring (junk). Their rare drop is a tradeable caster earring with 45hp, 60mana and permanent see invis, which is better but still not worth it. For decent loot, go further in. <br />
<br />
Specifically, you need to invis yourself with improved ITU, go out of the entrance room, and turn right. Pretty soon you'll come to another junction where there's a bridge ahead... again, turn right. <br />
<br />
Be careful here. The open area to your right contains live critters which can see you. Hug the left wall until you're near the doorway at the other side of the cavern. <br />
<br />
At the doorway, there's a set of stairs ahead. Guarding the stairs are two golems. These are live critters and they can see you; the other critters in the room are undead. Cross the room smartly to the right hand wall. At the first sign of aggro, DA and run to zone; you'll have to zone back in and start again. With a bit of practise, you can cross this doorway safely. <br />
<br />
From here, hug the right hand wall until you reach the next chamber. You'll get a message about the "cackling of undead in this haunted chamber". The haunted chamber is your destination, and you'll need to clear one monster to establish your camp spot; it's over against the right hand wall. It'll be undead, so kill it however you like. <br />
<br />
There are several other static spawns and wanderers in this room. If you're over where you killed the first monster, you're out of wanderer aggro; they're subject to pacification so you don't need to kill them. Clear as many of the static spawns as you can. <br />
<br />
If a Rabid Chokidai pops in this room, it will have different drops. Common drop here is a pair of 15sta 40hp boots (junk); rare drop is a tradeable necklace with FTII. That necklace is your jackpot - it sells for 150,000pp to 250,000pp on Xev. <br />
<br />
<b>Shadowfrost's guide to soloing for brag value</b><br />
<br />
Go to the Halls of Honor. Drink an invis potion or use your Larrikan's Mask/GVD. Follow the left hand wall. Keep going until you reach a place where there are three wrulons. Run past the wrulons and you'll see six critters immediately in front of you which look like white suits of armour. <br />
<br />
These critters are rootable, undead, and do not summon. Therefore, you can solo them. They're worth about 5%aa exp each. <br />
<br />
Choose a corner of the building to solo in; corners are safe from wanderers and you can go AFK there. Select the nearest white suit and pacify the other suits near it. Pull it with Destroy Undead, and root it out of aggro range of its friends. Use Epitaph of Life and Sermon of Penitence to kill it, and Dawncall if you have a Hammer of the Sun (a Hammer of the Sun really, really helps here.) Expect root to break early and often, and expect the critter to resist stuns and roots sometimes.<br />
<br />
Kill one of these, and you've killed a monster with something like 40,000hp who hits for over 500, hence the brag value.  ;)</td>

I'm impressed Shadowfrost.  That is way more than I had guessed any cleric could have done.  Especially the part about Chardok B.<br />
<br />
Did a little more soloing last night in Seb.  Had to gate because of root not holding and runner had sow.  I do have one suggestion to new clerics.  If you are deciding on a race, Dark Elf with Inny diety is way to go.  Root is okay, but I have gotten in trouble with it a few times, where the snare necklace would have been a life saver.<br />
<br />
I plan to post here again when I have some new information.  That will probably be a few weeks from now.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Soloing up to 60 is possible. Been there, done that. Melee, nuking, dotting. Anything goes in the right spot.<br />
<br />
Soloing post-60 is tougher. There are a couple spots with baby blue mobs you can kill, like Karnor's basement and Nadox. The only place I might recommend at all though is HoH, at the white spirits camp. (Southeast shrine)<br />
Go to a front corner of the room. Pacify the side spawn. Pacify the near spawn in the front. Pacify the rear spawn on that side. Pull the side spawn, and root it in the corner. Dot it with whatever you've got, and stay on your horse as much as possible. Time root yourself so you can refresh it before it breaks, assuming it goes the full length. A Hammer of the Sun really helps for this, (right click Dawncall,) but can be done without. I'd advise using clarity unless you know you can do it without. It takes about 5 minutes to kill a mob with 3 dots, plus any med time you might have.<br />
When you pull the front spawn, pacify the other front spawn and the rear. Then the rear, if you get to it, is just pacify the other rear spawn. Unless you're so vewy powa, you won't get more than 3 spawns per cycle. I've heard of people doing two at once, but you'll go oom after just as many spells either way; don't risk it.</td>

<br />
I'd like to share some resent experiences.  If any of this is boring, just say so and I'll quit posting.  I'm kind of on a crusade to see if a cleric can solo efficiently for exp and if so what it takes to succeed.  I very much enjoy grouping and still do that about 85% of the time, but I'll always squeeze a little solo time in here and there.<br />
<br />
After a LDoN group last night I went to Velks.  I really like this zone, not too crowded and mobs are undead.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I went last night and early this morning before work.  During the LDoN group I dinged 63 and thought maybe the Rotting Peasants and Commoners might be easier this time.  They are dark blue and fall between levels of 50 - 52 (according to beastie list on Allakhazam's site).  I tried them the day before at 62 and was able to win a battle (barely), then had to gate on the second attempt.   As level 63 with the new hammer, things went a little bit better.  The first battle was won with only one close call.  And I finished with a blue bubble of mana.  The second battle went terrible from the start.  Got harm touched for 700 points of damage, then feared and summoned.  I finally got a HoT off and proceeded to apply the damage shield and summon a pet.  We exchanged blows for a while, with me staying between 20% and 50% health :(  Finally he feared me into the next room  where I died instantly.<br />
<br />
So, that spanking made me rethink things.  Until I get better gear, I'm going to stick to light blue / dark blue mix.  This morning I decided to try the light blue / dark blue area near the entrance (right where you go up the ramp).  All sentries and crusaders in that area.  That was a piece of cake.  Finished every battle full health and 90m or fm.  Only buff other than my own was KEI.  Killed five of these guys before having to log for work.  Only took maybe 20 mins and got around 1.5 blue ticks total.  I think I could average one blue bubble per hour (of real exp).<br />
<br />
My gear is pretty bad.  No focus items and self buffed 1080 AC.  I had 1100 AC, but had to sell a piece of armor to prepare for HoV purchase.  I think with 1200 AC, decent agility, and a few  AAs in the defense area, the Rotting Peasants and Commoners will be a breeze.  I'm planning to hit Nadox and Mines of Thurgian soon.  The soloing there is easy for a Necro, so probably doable for cleric.  Won't be fighting undead in the mines, but I plan on meleeing anyway.</td>

<br />
(1)  Only use your own buffs.  The only reason you'd do this is for the brag value - it's horrible loot and horrible xp - and REAL soloers do it self-buffed!  KEI is for wimps.<br />
(2)  Don't try this unless you're level 65.  Pacification is a must.<br />
(3)  It will take you about 4500 mana to kill one of these, and you want a bit of mana left over for emergencies.  You also stand a fairly high risk of the monster breaking free and thumping you for 500+.  I'd say that if you don't have 5k hp and 5k mana when you try it, you're running a fair risk of failure and the consequent downtime.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">just had to tell you all i went to HoH w/a necro to see what we could do at the camp Shadow mentioned.  well we were all set to go, i went to paci & OMG, after casting pacification 100 gazillion times in many other zones & NEVER have it fail, the mob resists...so i got 3 of these white suits of armour beatin on me and i assure you I went down quick :p  so, no big deal...necro had FD'd so he waited til they all returned to there little spots, pulled my corpse & rezzed me.  of course, now i'm too scared to try to paci, so he FD pulls.  OOPS, his FD works just fine, but apparently I am in agro range so guess what...dead cleric lol.  so i'm sittin in pok memming my spells waitin for the necro rez, again & he's not sayin anything.  so i ask if he's ok & he's like, yeah I'm killin one. anyhoo, long story short i get my rez & we got our stuff together & we root rotted like mad & got some really nice aa exp :)  thanks for the tips Shadow.<br />
<br />
before we headed to HoH, we decided to try out Chardok B.  Now the necro is almost ally to DiZok so he had no worries, i of course am still KOS.  so we invis & just start running until we get to some undead mobs.  boom, agro so we keep runnin, no big deal they're barely touching me.  so we're running & running & running all the while more mobs keep addin & i'm at about 20% health so i just DA there & start runnin some more.  Well sometimes i swear i've got the mind of a 90 year old cuz i completely forgot to load up DB AND i forgot the directions from Shadow's post.  Lost track of the necro somewhere & finally i just stopped where i was & let the sarnaks finish me off.  when i got the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT message i couldn't count all the mobs.  my friend just kinda stood there & started counting as they left my body & he swears there were almost 50 lol.  I was quite impressed w/the calibur of that train lemme tell you :p  eventually tho, we did get into Chardok B & it was quite fun.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello Again!   Thought I'd share my recent solo attempts in Veksar...<br />
<br />
I know some of you uber clerics have done way more, but maybe others will find this interesting/useful.  Please feel free to share anything you guys have experienced recently :)<br />
<br />
Finally was able to get my AC above 1200.  And also made level 64.  I thought with the new AC and Mark of Kings spell I might do a little better...<br />
The first pull was a Commoner (level 50 undead mob).  Besides self buffs, I had KEI and Spiritual Purity.  SP wore off halfway through battle, but none the less I finished with only 1/2 a blue of mana used!   The mob was dark blue to me.<br />
<br />
So, I was pumped.  Besides KEI, I only had self buffs at this point.  I pacified a couple of mobs and pulled a Rotting Peasant (51 - 54 undead mob).  At first things went pretty good.  He was hitting hard, but missing enough that I didn't use too much mana.  Then he started hitting a lot and my mana bar came in line with his health.  I finally got him down to 40% health when he interrupted all my heal attempts with a string off attacks.  I died with about 45% mana.<br />
<br />
Going to hold off on solo until I get level 65 and the AAs for damage mitigation.  I'm going for that first, because I want to see with my own eyes that it really will mitigate 10% of melee damage.  I pretty much have memorized how much max a Rotting Peasant should hit for.  I believe with the new LDoN spell, I get hit for 193 max, and about 226 when the spell wears off.  Eventfully, I hope to see that with damage mitigation, damage avoidance, and the POP defense abilities all maxed, I'll be avoiding/mitigating to the tune of having a 40% slow.  With that kind of defense, I should be able to take any Rotting Peasant with ease!<br />
<br />
One thing I learned...  Prior to this attempt I did win against a Rotting Peasant with only 1100 AC.  I now believe that the AC difference between 1100 and 1200 is minimal.  It just didn't seem like that extra 100 AC was helping much.  I felt that I was getting hit harder and more often with the higher AC.  I attribute that to bad luck and fighting a higher level version of the same mob, and AC having a minimal impact above 1100.  I'm still going to shoot for more AC, but it isn't as high a priority now.</td>

<br />
Heres a few mobs I have taken out... granted MANY of these HURT!!! and Many times did I DIE! But DAMM IT WAS FUN!!<br />
<br />
<b>lvl 52-54 - Chardok Zone in</b>. Pummeling welps and the ugly snarks, At this lvl my equipment was = to SS. with a normal mana pool and a "will to kill". Granted it was slow and often hurt.. Tricks n tips.<br />
-Bind at the entrance to chardok befor you zone in.<br />
-in my case I have the snare amulet so you may wana root rather then kite.<br />
-after about 1hr of watching a cleric beat up zone trash, someone will deffinatly invite you to a group.. join up and move to the fortress :)<br />
<br />
<b>lvl 54-56 - Howling Stones </b>, (Charsis) Again if you are super brave it IS possibal to solo this zone in, enfact its stupidly easy once you split the 2 zone in mobs...<br />
-bind outside in OT. (I bound atop of the cliff above the door, DA and jump/run like heck) granted I think Sony changed fall damage... so dono.. else bind in the hallway befor you zone in.<br />
<br />
once you zone in, DONT move. theres 2 wondering mobs, however you wont agro them untill you move. provided both are undead, IVU yourself and move across from 1 when they are togther.. Root one and root/dot the other to death.. once the upper two are cleared, set a timer for 15mins and fall down on the rocky ledge (levi helps) once your down you can esentually root rott anything wondering by w/o to much agro.. again if you get in trouble, GATE or run to the sparkels, (keep in mind for what ever reason mobs can still hit you /shrug)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I am an insaine cleric and push myself to the limits...<br />
<br />
<b>lvl 56-60ish - Kale</b> Nothing tough here, goto kale WL or EW side and nuke nuke nuke, (btw dont forget .... your a big cleric now... so "It's Hammer time"<br />
<br />
<b>ME</b> As already stated ME's great for soloing. (camp the 3 spawn directly out from DSP for VT shards well your there)<br />
<br />
<b>AR</b> Very easy place to solo, lots of room to walk around / kite or plant your mobs, best part is the trains one can make, and well no one ever goes there anymore other then for raid targets and shards. (well your there, go straight down the hall, past the first 3 way... keep going... hang a HARD left, theres a corner there with rock mobs... pull those and start camping your shards for VT)<br />
<br />
<b>Seru</b> This is kinda a nasty zone, mobs dont hit hard, but they hit FAST, making spell casting painfull. but if you can hack it, theres a great solo spot at the far back end of the zone on the right. can root/kite all along the back wall, at the same time as camping your seru shard. you want the legos.. (personally bribe/hire a shammy or chanter and split the shards, good xp and you get shards to boot)<br />
<br />
omg I almost forgot Sebilis!!<br />
<br />
B1 B1 B1 B1 B1... Woot! Good gems and cash, and well B2 and B3 will gladly donate for rez. fast cash decent xp.!<br />
<br />
Those were the only non pop places i gota chance to solo, all were fun, seru and charsis hurt the most, but were the best XP for their lvls.<br />
<br />
/gulp. Now for Pop.. lol..  (65 +++ A good AC and 4500+ mana) but more importantly "THE WILL TO KILL"<br />
<br />
Not so required items, But they HELP!<br />
#1 A Primal, if you dont have one, go blow up ST and get one! they help HUGE!<br />
#2 a Haste Item, I actually won one of these at B2... and well its probally my best /rand win todate.<br />
#3 proper spells, Ensure you have spells suited for what your killing, ie: dead? or undead? stun? ect.<br />
#4 a determination to KILL, if your not willing to die trying your not gona solo..<br />
other goodies...<br />
Hammer of the Sun, SSRA Cycle.<br />
Summoned Hammer, (get 56 one then 63 one, dont waste your $$$ on the others for 2 more dps)<br />
Dark Mace of Thought, Vex Thul, DXXT... yip chop em up, hes always got one... very nice mana drain.<br />
<br />
As for pop mobs Ive killed a few... ofcourse the normal HoH undead camp, EXCEPT. I wanted to feel some real pain, so I MELEE'ed ONLY one to death to make sure ViE works.. Lo and behold it HURT badly, but I managed to waste one, SELF buffed, with 1 dot only and my Hammer..<br />
Looked like, MoK/MoR Stun.. HoT wack wack wack DoT Stun wack wack HoT... Keep inmind this was a SOLO kil so it was UN-SLOWED.. and like I said hurt like Heck... but dam it I killed one!!! (yes it killed me the 2 times befor but I dont care... I wasted it)<br />
<br />
<b>CoD</b> As insaine as it sounds CoD undead is EXTREAMLY FUN! and when I mean fun, I mean death and carnage EVERYWHERE... Zone in, BIND beside the Exit! Invis to the bridge... then IVU yourself... Run past carprin and all his buddies (CON EVERYTHING THE ODD ONE SEE's INVIS, normally tho you can walk right past carprin with IVU) Run past the king rooms to the very end.. theres a corner towards the back with 1 mob... Root it.. Stun it and Dot it... remember to keep it stuned or else it will nuke you to death.. The undead mobs in CoD are CRAZZY solo xp, They HURT like Heck and offer an EXCELLENT challange. and YES they can be OWNED by a cleric, Solo. (granted I recomend a KEI for this one) :)<br />
<br />
If you have problems with CoD ... Rent-a-necro and go back, you 2 will totally own undead there and its awesome xp. (dueled you should be cranking around 250pct aa xp per hr at 65)<br />
<br />
<b>PoI</b> At 65 most can summon hammer, load nukes and stunn and just go nuts.. I dono what the best level to solo there is, but Im guessing 62ish. Hammer time...<br />
<br />
<b>PoNightmares</b> I only soloed this at 65, but the guards to ponB were kinda fun.. granted they are immune to pass and root, so you will NEED TO KITE 2 at once to split.. lol fun fun... :)<br />
<br />
<b>BoT</b> Theres not to much to solo in bot, however like HoH I decided that a cleric can own a giant melee... so yes, I got out the hammer and wasted myself a giant MELEE Solo! just because... and Like HoH w/o Slow... it Hurt like heck and was a pretty scarry fight... keep in mind this was a normal Mob from earth wing, (the easiest ones, but not the elementals) I forget name, because I try and avoid BoT like the plague.<br />
<br />
Recently I was privilaged with full elem access, and omg all I can say is FUN FUN FUN!!! <br />
<br />
<b>PoFire</b> sofar Ive managed to get a zone in trash mob, (not the horse but the other one at zone in) down to 31 pct... Granted mobs resist TONS here, HURT like heck and generally will cause GREAT whooooa to you if they touch you... nether the less they are FUN FUN FUN!!! and dam it I WILL KILL ONE! (not melee w/o slow tho, lol, theres somethings clerics wernt ment to solo 1:1)<br />
<br />
along with lots of resists, landing max damage nukes can be tough. Snare is a MUST, or else you can kite them with an Emp or Seru horse + levitate just behind zone in.. again tho.. they touch you and it's "game over man, it's game over"<br />
<br />
<b>PoEarth</b> hmm havent found anything I have a shot at killing sofar, then again im an earth n00b sofar... Im sure one day I will find something :)<br />
<br />
A little side note...<br />
<br />
Cleric Tanks!!!!<br />
<br />
Yes believe it or not clerics hold UNMATCHED agro... sofar Ive tanked (and I mean holding agro 99 pct of the time letting the other 5 ppl kill it) Every NORMAL mob in bot except Kriegars, (they just hurt) Air Mini and Fire Mini and Tower+ mobs, (yes atleast one cleric has tanked Oreen and Earth) :) (granted that was in a group WITH slow ect, but still TONS of FUN!)<br />
<br />
In HoH tanked everything except the really mean kitties in the back left, (guardians and the LT's mainly) their whimps...<br />
<br />
Sol Ro, Can tank the protectors, Although only got to tank once there... they kinda hurt..<br />
<br />
PoStormes, Tanked Forest Mini, sigh well most of it... bugger mana drained me to 00m at 30pct so I found myself a warrior to finish him off ... sigh..<br />
<br />
Tanking Spells.<br />
<br />
Supernal Light<br />
EE<br />
Superal R<br />
Stunn<br />
Stunn<br />
Nuke<br />
Binding luminance. or MoR<br />
Nuke<br />
<br />
BL / Stun / Nuke / Stun / repeat till dead... the other cool thing, is if you do lose agro and mob turns on someone else... no problem, just cast a high agro heal on the person and presto, mob glued to cleric tank! :)<br />
<br />
btw: tanking is where AA ability Channeling Focus comes in... :) well atleast thats the use I found for my 18 aa's in it, hehehehe.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, these are just my kills, Im not trying to seem over inflated, or what not, What I am saying is it IS possibal to push clerics to the limits! and push I will till I die... then Ill rez myself and try again!!! Sigh no wonder I can never make Alt's sigh, No Click stick for those "OMG, way too much to drink EQ tours" :)<br />
<br />
ps, sounds like one day I gota go blow up veksar too... woot!<br />
<br />
btw, most mobs tanked were with 250+ aa's and decent "stuff" and ofcourse more importantly the "Will to Kill"<br />

Unless you make it clear you're tanking, others will try to steal aggro, and beastlords do it without trying. I usually use the two "valid" stuns at that level, plus a couple lower level ones just to build up hate. I do next to no damage that way, but it usually works, and I'm not there for the DPS anyway.</td>

A Flame Lordling in PoF was slayen yesterday!

As for Agro Restandre, Generally I start with my Inny amulet when its at max range, then Stun ... Nuke .. and re-stun it. By that time its in close range, so I hit it with Level 34 Blinding luminance (dono why a lvl 34 spell is such high agro but it works well) Then Stun refreshes, Stun/nuke/stun/BL. About 95pct of the time that combo will out agro pretty much anyone... If by some chance the mob turns on another player, Let the player get whacked once and supernal rem them.. granted thats the offensive spell part, Im also hasted useing a FHoZ and Primal and yalp. (I think w/o proc thats about 8 or 9 dps.. with SoV more like 11 dps)<br />

sigh, the worst part about trying to tank tho is convincing the rest of the group to even let you... again, tho, its nice to have a second healer to help out when you cant get that heal off. wich is the real danger of letting the cleric lay some waste. all in all though, its a nice change, and EXTREAMLY fun! and deffinatly beats sitting in the corner and healing!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">After last nights raid I decided to head to HoH and give Shadowfrost's idea a shot. I had tried this once earlier this week and went OOM with the mob at 1% and dotted. He probably died as I was zoning to bind point but I'll never know. So last night I gave this another shot and did my first succesful solo of an HoH mob aka Valorous Spirit.<br />

I also kicked a monks arse in Arena before the raid. ;)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Only things I do differently is I've never used BL, and obviously I don't have a snare necklace. I'll give blind a try tho. Yesterday I was grouped in LDoN with a really well-equipped druid, and when our tank went LD, of all people, guess who I was fighting for the temporary position? Yeah, try as I might, I couldn't get aggro. I think the druid was chain-snaring and casting her Ro debuff or something.</td>

That reminds me of the last time we did the Ragefire dragon for a cleric in our guild a couple weeks ago. We had zero melee class and 4 people total. My guild leader is a druid, and before we spawned the dragon he said "MT is whoever holds aggro" He and I ping ponged that dragon from start to finish. It was so funny to watch that dragon just spin in a circle switching between me and my GL, that thing must have gotten dizzy not knowing who he wanted to hit.</td>
