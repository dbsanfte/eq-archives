<br />
When setting up a hotkey for a CH chain during raids, we often have discussions about how long the /pause actually is, in seconds. At the very first CH chain I partook in, it was explained to me that /pause 30 for instance, was 3 seconds. Later on I figured that this cant be right, its too slow, and then another cleric in my guild made some research and confirmed my guesses. Is there anyone who has a deffinite fact on how long, for instance 1 second is, in a /pause command? <br />
<br />
Would be glad for any help. :)</td>

I put /pause 25 and this seemed to pop a message exactly halfway through my cheal cast. So I would say that /pause 5 is 1 second.

Exactly .. if you are unhasted for example, CH takes 10 seconds to cast PLUS the time it takes you to refresh and be able to cast again, assuming unhasted still.. you would be able to cast CH every 12 seconds allowing for the refresh time. <br />
<br />
That being true when I do a 2 cleric CH rotation I never put a /pause in it at all actually. When I see the other cleric's CH has landed, then I cast mine with a normal group msg /g casting CH on %T sort of thing. That way no tiny bit of lag etc will cause the chain to stumble.</td>

<br />
so, when you're saying it's taking longer, you're right, due to lag in the zone, and other server problems, it's taking longer to get BACK to you, similar to having a tell lag, or channel lag...<br />
<br />
try this next time when you're bored....goto the bazaar (a zone which ever server has 500 people on all the time)....put in a pause ammount, and watch what happens...now goto a vastly un-popluated zone....and hit the same pause ammount...your results should vary greatly....<br />
<br />
EQ is highly in-accurate when it comes to timing....i've noticed it alot when 2-boxing my SK alt...CHs APPEAR to be taking 2+seconds in between, but really i hit my key as soon as i saw the person before me cast....gotta love raid lag....especially in PoWater >_<</td>

maybe they are not facts hun, but trust the experience of your fellow clerics here....we are not at the lvl we are now by simply doing something that is not right.<br />
<br />
Most of the answerews you ahve received here are fromn EP or time enable clerics who have used rotations for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Of course it is your choice to decide on what you have to do but trust me i think people wont answer posts if they have absolutely have no idea whastoever/.<br />
<br />
and AGAIN i am with Kamiff....pause in a CH rotation is the DEVIL :P<br />
<br />
<br />
and to my experience..you should start counting when the cleric before you  STARTS to cast. and guage yourself on the fact that CH takes 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
ex: when the lead cleric calls for a 2 second rotation...that means the casts are 2 seconds apart...in other words...there should be a CH cast every 2 seconds  ( cleric #1 cast CH, 2 seconds later cleric #2 cast CH, 2 seconds later cleric #3 cast CH....when you get to #5 the first clerics CH has landed and so on......)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">First in regards to the rogue consent hotkey...the reason pause is used in this hotkey is because a five line macro with /consent on it will not work. For whatever reason, the game mechanics will not allow you to consent 5 rogues that fast. /pause is used to put a delay between each consent, thus allowing the game to properly grant consent to each rogue.<br />
<br />
Now, aside from the fact that the /pause time will yield inconsistant results for many reasons already mentioned, the real reason why I hate pause so much is the fact that /pause locks you in and you cannot do anything else while the /pause timer is running. Say, for example we have 3 clerics and we decide we are going to run a rotation with /pause 40. Your healing away, all is working fine, and the MT takes a nasty round of melee and the second you hit your macro the MT goes down. I for one would like the freedom to be able to /duck the heal, /target the second tank, and throw a fast heal at him, while the other clerics can /duck their CH, /target the second tank, and re-establish a CH rotation.<br />
<br />
I know some may argue that's why you have druids and other clerics spamming fast heals during the rotation, and that is fine. But I want the freedom to be able to /duck out of a spell and cast something else if something goes wrong or needs adjusting.<br />
<br />
Another issue is if you set up a rotation with a set /pause. 2 rounds into it you realize the MT is taking more damage then anticipated and the lead cleric tells the cleric channel to pick up the pace. Every cleric now either must open the macro and make an adjustment, or go to ignoring the "NOW" message and start counting on their own.<br />
<br />
Once you hit elementals this all goes away anyway. We no longer count in our guild. When you see the CH message of the cleric before you, it's your turn to cast. If the cleric before you lags or delays for more then a second, you cast, brcause they may be dead and if you don't take their place you will be soon to follow. Mobs that can do 16K hp in damage in one round don't require counting. :,(</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Pause is widely-used, and also widely-refuted. The people that don't like it claim that it allows for less adjustment, and that it creates more trouble when there is lag. There are also two ways of doing pause - cast your CH, and then after a pause give a message for next cleric to cast. OR, simply pause when you see the previous cleric cast, and then have your macro cast after the pause and call your heal then. I highly recommend the latter if you do decide to use pause.<br />
<br />
For the general answer you wanted, pause is measure in tenths of seconds, and just how much pause you should use is completely dependent on the situation, but can not be less than 12 seconds divided by the number of healers on the chain. (With 5 clerics, you can't do a 2 second chain.) Best thing to do if you don't know is to start fast, and adjust. Someone who realizes the healing power is being wasted calls to SLOW IT TO FOUR (spammed) and you count a little longer. Ofc, this is trickier using pause, but you can quickly edit your macro while your cast is going, so it isn't impossible.</td>

<br />
A couple of examples:<br />
<br />
1.  6 cleric rotation with ~ 2 seconds between heals.  Now an AE kills off 3 of those clerics.  The remaining clerics must start chain healing.  You can start just casting CH but then you have no message going out.<br />
<br />
2.  The first few times you killed the mob your best-dressed tank was tanking.  You have decided on a great pause time in your macro.  This time the second best tank is tanking.  You notice DI has gone off twice and all the heals are way too large for safety.  If you use /pause you can't speed up the rotation.  The tank dies the second tank dies the raid fails.<br />
<br />
3.  Your fighting a mob the rotation is going very well.  Most of your heals are much less then 50% of the tanks.  Suddenly the ranger in your group goes down fast.  If you used pause there is nothing you can do, but if you are counting, you can duck out of the CH and hit Divine Arbitration.   You save the ranger and he can keep using trueshoot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure counting takes a little learning, but it's much safer.  Couple of pointers when counting during the CH.  First, turn off the TV.  Second, start counting about 3 people ahead of you. Third, keep an eye on how much you are healing for.  If you are healing for too much then cast more quickly and if you are healing for too little then wait a little longer before casting.<br />

<br />
1) Clerics who randomly go LD aren't welcome in the first place.<br />
2) Clerics who routinely lag aren't welcome.<br />
<br />
I'm going to get flamed for this next statement.  Using count instead of /pause is just a point of pride for clerics who don't want to be labeled in the same category as ch chain bots.  The sad truth is that clerics during uber mob fights aren't very difficult to play.  We distinguish ourselves in groups and on mass mob clearing /assist heal raids.  Clerics during single mob fights are a function of gear and lag, the intelligence level required to operate during these fights is nothing exceptional.  Either method can function well for your guild.  If your clerics are bored of using /pause then go with a count instead but either method will work.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'll agree once you've trivialized an encounter /pause will work Heretic, but I still go with the anti-pause crowd. It allows for adjustment which is very good for new encounters, i.e. you can speed up or slow down the rotation easily. Or when the MT goes down, you can switch to a faster chain on the secondary tank more easily. <br />
<br />
I've found /pause can vary by up to a factor of two. For example /pause 90 should be 9 seconds, but I've found it can range anywhere from 6 to 12 or so depending on how laggy the server is. So it's not just the flexibility, but the variance of /pause itself that adds to it not being a very good choice.<br />
<br />
The only downside to /pause is that it's up to your clerics being able to count consistently. However I think the variance of this is much less than that of /pause, unless your clerics are really bad :p .</td>

<br />
If we have a cleric lag out, we just hit the key sooner. Our rotations NEVER use more then 5 clerics in rotation for ANY mob I have yet to fight.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Just to interrupt the flow of the discussion for a moment in order to answer the original question...<br />
<br />
In theory, /pause is measured in tenths of a second.  In practise, you need to adjust it to take account of client/server lag.<br />
<br />
The adjustment which is appropriate varies from zone to zone and from player to player, and sometimes from day to day.<br />
<br />
However, if you're of the "let's use /pause" school of thought and you want a simple answer, here's how a lot of people do it:  If you need a pause of "n" seconds, then the pause you'd use is (n*10)-5.<br />
<br />
So, for example, for a three second CH chain use /pause 25; for a five second use /pause 45; for a six second use /pause 55.  Then do a practise rotation and adjust these numbers downwards if you have connection issues or a lot of lag.<br />
<br />
<b>Important facts about /pause and connections</b><br />
<br />
First:  it doesn't matter what you see on your screen.<br />
<br />
No indeed - the only things that matter about CH rings are what the <i>server</i> sees and what your <i>tank</i> sees.  What your client sees is irrelevant:  Your tank will die if either (a) the server thinks he's dead or (b) his client thinks he's dead.<br />
<br />
This means that a tank with a so-so connection will die more often than a tank with the best connection going.  Your heal might have landed in time, but if his client doesn't know that he'll die.<br />
<br />
So when you rehearse your CH chain before the actual encounter, get your <i>tank</i> to tell you how far apart the heals are landing.<br />
<br />
Second:  A very good way of timing CH casts is to use the ping counter at the top left of your EQ screen.  If your connection is good enough for you to be in the CH ring, that ping counter refreshes almost exactly every second, and you can count the ping refreshes to time your heals.<br />
<br />
<b>Edited to add:</b><br />
<br />
EQ gives a very good <i>illusion</i> that everything is happening without lag.  You move around smoothly, the monsters animate smoothly, chat seems to arrive quickly.  That's in contrast to some other MMORGS, where you get things like lag hotspots where character movement slows to a standstill.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is that EQ delegates a lot of information handling and processing to the client.  If your client tells the server that you've done this and that and moved to this location, then in most cases the server simply believes you.<br />
<br />
(In the past this fact was used to enable certain exploits.  I believe that what happened was that some people went into their eq zone files and edited them to add a tunnel leading - for example - from Sebilis zone in directly to Trakanon's lair, enabling them to skip huge amounts of content.  Nowadays there's a little more checking as to what's actually going on so this kind of exploit is no longer possible.)<br />
<br />
However, it's important to understand that the illusion is precisely that - an illusion caused by clever delegation of processing and excellent net code.  In reality lag affects most things that you do.  The difference between EQ and other games is that EQ conceals it from you very effectively.<br />
<br />
But it's still there, and with things like /pause, you come to see how much lag there really is.</td>
