<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">If you dont know how to play your cleric at at least lvl 30+ ITS TIME TO START A NEW CLASS PEOPLE!! LOL.<br />
I dont understand some clerics. Last night we went to UP, we had one spot open in the grp and there was a cleric shouting for a grp. We felt sorry for him so invited him. <br />
We decided since i was higher lvl and the mobs have way too much hp id nuke and melle and he would heal. BIG mistake. This cleric was casting Complete heal on our bard chanter and wizzie when they hit 20% and casting remedy on the tanks when they hit 80% health!!! <br />
Not only that the guy complained about how clerics have not enuff mana to heal correctly....um i wonder why...at all down times the guy was casting Words of Health (lvl 34 lvl grp heal, that heals for 100hp) untill we were full health!! <br />
then I decided this guy has no clue what he was doing so i started to remem my spells for more healing power then melle, went afk for 2 min and our shammys health kept going down and the cleric just kept on chattering, by the time i looked at the health bar the shammy was 3% health i tried to cast a quick remedy but it was too late, and mean while this cleric just kept chatting he didnt even know the shammy died until after the fight was over and we all freaked out at why he died so stupidly!!!<br />
I can remember at least 4 other times ive grped with a cleric that had no clue what they were doing...what i want to know is how in the world they get to such a high lvl!! I can imagine these guys getting booted from every grp they join. Unless they are E-bayers or something.<br />
I know that this dosnt happen very often and probibly 90% of clerics are great at what they do, but my point of this post is if you dont know how to play, get another class. Clerics are so important to this game, we are the givers of life we if cant do our job right then the whole grp goes down with us.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I guess in a way I understand your anger. I mean sure by 30 he should know how to play a cleric. Although some healing spells are new to you in your 30's your not blessed with CH before 39 nor are you blessed witht he knowledge of group heals at lower levels. As good as I have been told I am, No matter the fact that at 39 I was fighting in KC. I DIDN'T understand CH or when or how or who to use it on till someone explained it to me. I didn't know the best time to use ti was with 2 bubs of life left. hell I would have probably gotten people killed because I would have been casting it with 1/2 or 1 bub left. I guess the point of my post is, wouldn't it have been better for you to kindly send him a tell and explain to him what spells to use and how to properly use them. Maybe even show him. Waht good does it do to come on here and knock him about not knowing how to play his char? You just let him get away with being bad at what he does, only for him to go join another group and for them to suffer the same fate. This isn't a character flaw in him as much as maybe he dosen't understand. If we as people who claim to be "cleric know it alls" or claim to "know how to play a cleric" let it go then we are just as much to blame for the death of the future group mebers of these people.</td>

Heh, I hope you realize the error in this statement.  I would much rather group with a person who knows the theory behind their class, rather than "use complete heal at 2 bubs".  When I am grouping with guild warriors, some of which have 6-7khp, why would I use Complete heal on them in an exp group when they have 2k+ hp remaining?<br />
<br />
The key to being a good cleric -- or just a <i>good player</i> -- is to be adaptable.  If you simply play a certain way because that is how people TELL you to play, then you aren't doing a very good job.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think the key to being a good cleric is knowledge.  Let me expound on this.  <br />
<br />
1) Know the mob - What it hits for and what your MA (Main Assist) has for AC and HP.  <br />
<br />
2) Anticipate - If you see the someones HP's falling at a steady rate start your heal early.  Also if the mob your fighting enrages expect the tank to NOT see the message.  Make an /assist key and be sure to turn your autoattack off in your profile first.  Then you can assist the MA find out where the mobs life is and use key again to retarget your MA for that all important CH.<br />
<br />
3) Conservation - With the Mod Rod nerf that totally sucks ballz mana preservation is all that more important.  Don't use those small heals unless you need to.  Let a support class pick those up or wait till after mob is dead cause you never know you may get an add or something like that.  <br />
<br />
Lastly I learn new things all the time and I have been playing this game for ages now.  Most of the things i stated here allot of you already know I am sure.  So have fun and remember we are the life blood of a successful raid so be proud of your l33t skillz you have learned and earned!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I played with a pickup group several hours last night in UP. <br />
<br />
I also cast CH at 2 bubbs, depending on MOB, and each new zone, you have to learn each new MOB,  and  I watch SA and cast Divine on them if needed. If group gets low I cast a group heal as MOB gets low on health. <br />
I USUALLY have no problems, but several hours into group, for some reason this MoB beats my MA down, I cast CH but she went down like a newbie. I felt awful, they were shouting at the chanter, chanter says they were slowed. I dont know, I guess things just happen <shrug> <br />
I think I will start to throw CH at 50% health from now on, even if they gripe about it. I have has tanks tell me dont heal me ..bla bla... I have all these HP ..bla bla....LOL <br />
<br />
As far as a cleric casting remedy in UP, I would be scared to be the tank in that group. There is a disband button.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Sorry guys, i didnt mean to write on how to play , nor did i mean you suck if you dont Complete heal all the time. But this guy really sucked LOL. <br />
I was also the same way, when i got CH i was afraid to use it as i didnt know how, a high lvl pally fought with me for a bit and explain when to cast it and how to time dam vrs Hp to cast the spell correctly. <br />
Im sorry but if you in your 50's (or any lvl for that matter) and casting CH on priest/caster at 20% health, no you dont know what your doing. If your casting remedy on the tank at 80% over and over then you still dont know what your doing. I let him do his thing for about 15min before i said something to him. I figured he knew what he was doing and he'd start playing normally after awhile. <br />
I asked him why he was casting CH on my sister (bard) when she was 20% health to which he stated as a bard she can handle it. When he casted CH on the chanter i told him that when a chanter is low its not safe for the grp to wait till the chanter is low to CH. To which he replied.... a chanter can handle it LOL. Sorry guys i know what you all are saying and maybe i didnt explain everything, but this guy had absolutly no clue as to what he was doing. If you think a chanter at 20% health can handle a CH while getting hit, then thats bad. If i had not casted remedy on him a ton of time this guy would have certinly died.<br />
It was very frustrating for me that night as after every fight he insisted that he had to med to full but he would only med after he casted words of health 20 times untill we were full HP (after a fight most of us still had 90% health).<br />
Even though we told the tank to pull and that i was FoM the tank refused to pull becasue the cleric was his friend and he was main heal and was oom.<br />
After about the 4th time he casted CH on the chanter at 20%hp the chanter got angry and asked us (discluding the other cleric and tank) if we wanted to leave the grp and start a new one without them becasue he was sick of trying to explain to this cleric how to heal.<br />
Its not like we didnt tell him what he was doing was wrong, we did and everyone except the wizzie (who didnt speak english) told him what heals to use on who. Yet he didnt listen and always had the same response for everything, lol its like he had it on a hot key. "a chanter/bard/wizzie/cleric (whatever class it was) can handle it" that was his response to everything.<br />
I even mentioned this guy to my guild to which 6 people  in guild has grped with this guy and they laughed and said E-bayer.<br />
I know as my cleric is my first char ive made on EQ and ive only played for about 1.5 years ive done some really stupid things in my time. Of course everyone makes mistakes. But if a lot of people are telling you that you are doing something wrong (as i said my grp , and 6 people in my guild knew this guy sucked) then you probibly have to do some more research on how to play your char.<br />
Sorry if ive offended anyone or didnt explain myself clearly, but that night with that guy had to be one of my more frustrating ones ive ever had</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think my most valuable lessons as a cleric were learned in that *horrid* zone known as KC. It was there I learned the value of knowing a mob's agro, enchanter's lack of HP's, tank skill, tank weapons/armor, etc.<br />
<br />
I can't count the times I have been praised for actually healing an enchanter at any sign of damage. I felt it was normal. A stiff wind would kill an enchanter...fully buffed.<br />
Learned that rangers that have a clue live. Rangers that are goofs...die. Alot. Many other lessons from xp groups and raids. The dynamics of a healing rotation...oh the joy.<br />
<br />
Being a high-level cleric means one main thing typically...and this goes for all other classes as well: Know your class. Saying xx class can "take it" doesn't really mean they should. I can tank without much difficulty in OS or Velks, but I challenge you to see me doing it unless required. (Like when the enchanter is getting wailed on...those mobs have no sense of humor when it comes to rapid fast heals.)<br />
<br />
I know several people on my server that I refuse to group with. It's not that they are rude or mean, but rather they have no concept of what to do. A warrior that simply hits auto-attack isn't my idea of a tank. A cleric that wastes group time by using mana inefficiently forcing much down time is just as bad.<br />
<br />
Oh, one other thing I will mention. Everybody has bad days. I have gone in ToV HoT all day, in a single group, without a death. I have also had a group in Velks Villa that had several deaths in a short period of time. It's when the bad outnumber the good that I get concerned.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well id like to say i agree with people above. The bread and butter of the cleric class is the complete heal. To be a good cleric you must be able to addapt. example= your partnering with a monk lets say he has about 2.5k hp or so u c heal at 2 bubs he has 1k hp left. you partner with a warrior the same day obviously his base hp is highers and other things come into effect such as STA and HP items and he has about 5k hp give or take. you c heal at 2 bubs well he still has 2k hp left and yes that is a waste. in KC i would have to cheal at 2 bubs most of the time but now hunting in seb with and average tank i start at 1.5 bubs as my base see how they take hits and work from there some tanks ill have to start at 2 bubs some i can start at 1 bub it all depends on the situation. your job as a cleric is to watch mana/life levels and make sure they both stay up.<br />
<br />
P.S. about that cleric casting word of healing during downtime, by anychance did he have akkirus greaves that is the effect on those and since it is mana less using those legs to heal during downtime can be very efficient.(cant wait till i can do it =\)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My primary is a cleric, and I play her almost exclusively, 'cos I just love the class. :)  I'm only level 45 though, so the following advice is probably no good for the high-end game.<br />
<br />
I have a few rules I follow religiously when I play, which not everyone agrees with, but which work for me well.<br />
<br />
1) CHeal the tank at 50% if the hps are going down fast.  Find out what their max hps are (buffed) and work out a reasonable point at which to heal them.  Usually 20% is just fine, but depending on gear and buffness, you might need to adapt.  (For your own peace of mind, don't wait until lower than 20 percent.  It's just not worth the stress if a mob gets in a few good whacks, or you get lagged, or a sudden pop nukes your MA.)<br />
<br />
2) Chuck a celestial heal on the nukers as soon as you see that spell go off.  They -will- get thumped, and preventative measures go a long way.<br />
<br />
2a) If you don't have the mana for a celestial, throw the base-level stun on the critter right after the nuker has hit it.  It'll aggro onto you, and you can take the damage a damn sight better. (OK, this only applies if you're a battle cleric.  For non-defensive clerics, stick with the heal option) The non-painful alternative is to chain-stun it until the MA gets aggro back. Works fine, and no-one gets hurt.<br />
<br />
3) If any person does something stupid that puts them in danger, I'll heal them, and /tell them what went wrong and not to do it again.  If they do it a second time, I'll /say the same, so that anyone in 'earshot' can hear me warn them.  Third time, I let them die.  Without rez.  If you've died through your own stupidity after repeated warnings, DO NOT expect me to fix you up good again.  If I'm feeling nice I'll do the zero-xp rez back to your corpse for you.<br />
<br />
4) If any group I'm in has one of the No.3 people above in it, I'll hang there for the first 2 strikes, then advise them that I'm leaving.  I don't bother sticking around for Strike 3.  Its bad enough when idiots get themselves killed but when they risk a group, I'm outta there.  If the rest of the group lack the pattern recognition skills to see what's coming, then they probably deserve it.  (I'm talking specifically about post-30 groups here - people who've been playing long enough to know what constitutes good gameplay and what doesn't.)<br />
<br />
I know that these rules might seem harsh, but even though I'm a healer class, I don't see my role as that of Protector of the Dangerously Stupid.  My honest opinion is that it's better to let them die a bunch of times until they get their act together and work out where they're going wrong.  Pandering to them, compensating for their idiocy, does no-one any favours in the long run.</td>

My hubby was grouped once with a cleric who was too busy melleeing to heal! Yah this may happen once or twice but Everyone that i talked to complains that they were left to die while he was hitting the mob.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Been reading the above comments for when to complete heal and I have seen ranges from Tank health from 20% to 50%. My opinion to clericing has 3 objectives. 1) Keep group alive 2) mana management 3) Avoid agro if possible. In regards to the first objective, especially in high level zones, to keep group alive you main concerns are your main tank, slowers mezzers and of course yourself. Others in group are expendable and if they are drawing agro and i have a choice of healing the shammy or the ranger guess who loses. 20% tank health is not an option when fighting tier 2 mobs in pop for healing your tank. Even slowed mobs get bursts of hits and i have seen 6000 + hp tanks drop from 40% to 0 in no time. The method I use in PoV is on arrival i cast supernal elixir on tank as mobs starts its first damage. I have yet to have drawn agro for doing this. This allows we some time that i know 2000-2500 hp are going to tank in the next 24 sec to have slowers target ready incase of his drawing argo and needing a quick remedy. This has also worked with muti mob pulls with chanter being targeted after tank gets his first shot of HOT. Clerics take a lot of flack for deaths that are not their fault. This is a group game no one class can save a group but one bad player in group can surely cause failure. shaman and echanters do misread screens and holler mob slowed. Other class like druids, wizs bards and all other support classes must know their main role is to keep agro on tank and not themselves. ,  RULE #1 for cleric always watch group HP bar. If you wanna watch TV while playing eq start a wizard. Mana management is also a key, dont start using nukes and wasting mana when you join a group. Learn your groups dynamics untill you see what abilities they have to handle the mobs in the zone you are fighting. If after that you see you have extra time and mana for nuking or even melee assist then do so. Casting nukes and then having  to tell group to hold pulls is a waste of time.  Remember you main class objective is to keep group alive. Watch the flow of HP losses on your tank this will help ya learn what spells to cast for the lowest mana use for a fight. <br />
This is not foolproof but anytime something is foolproof life creates a better fool.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I try and time it so that cheal lands when they are in the teens of %hp left. Generally I cheal at 30-35%  depending. Depending on the mob, wether its slowed or not, weather its weakened or not, etc. Like in Poi, an unslowed mob will tear a tank apart and chealing at 35%...the person will either die or be chealed at unconciousness. It has worked once, it hit at 4% but...Thats a little late for me...<br />
I have hit a cheal at unconciousness before was in DL and right after i started another mob added and started beating him down doubly. Was a giant so we couldnt mez it and the chanter was having a hard time slowing. But yea...was fun...anyway<br />
In poi if we dont have a chanter, if its not one of the baby wussie mobs, I cheal when they drop under 45%. <br />
<br />
I betcha he thought remedy would heal for more because it was a higher spell. Guy obviously had no common sense. I know way back when Superior Heal was my primary heal, I'd use Gheal on casters if they got hurt. Same logic follows, Cheal was his 39 heal...remedy was his 51 heal, i guess he thought higher level heal=more healing healed. He thought wrong but...</td>

I do think people are a little too critical of clerics, so I listen to everything with a grain of salt. I like the tanks who can't tank and wear paper for armour, who tell you how to do your job. Usually backed up with the statment "my main is a 65 Cleric" I know what I'm talking about. And your other car is a rolls too, Moped boy.
