<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">When you aren't healing, you should be looking for someone to heal. Well, unless you're buffing or rezzing. Some clerics will disagree with this statement, but imho a cleric should under no circumstances try to add DPS to a real raid.<br />
<br />
Make two hotkeys. "/tar (MA's name)" and "/assist". The second one should have no target. Any time you see a mob, try to target it, and assist back and forth between the mob and its target. (Hopefully that will be the MA.) In multi-pulls, check the MA's health occasionally, but also make sure you assist other loose mobs; many healers won't do this while they chew the raid apart, especially when they can't be mezzed. Also, set your toggle key. This has been unbelievably useful since I learned about it, like when I assist the mob and get some enchanter likely mezzing another mob; toggle back to the mob (at no lag delay) and try again until it changes or you see some damage to heal.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have to respectfully disagree with Restandre about adding DPS to a raid.<br />
<br />
A raid typically has one main Raid Tank, a secondary tank, and maybe a third tank.  The raid tank will usually be taking ALL the damage from trash mobs on the way to a boss.  This means that the cleric in the raid tank's group has the main responsibility of healing the tank.  In our raids, if the main cleric is LOM or is having problems, he will call for assists on heals in our raid heal channel.  Usually trash mobs don't unduly tax the main cleric, and he will not have problems with mana.  During the majority of the raid, the clerics in other groups will have very little healing to do (assuming the raid tank is doing his job and the DPS knows how to do theirs).  This is the time for clerics to add DPS to the raid.  On the way to a boss, I usually have condemnation and mark of kings memmed, which I cast on every mob.  You should expend mana so that you are between 90-99% mana just before every mob.  Sitting or running around with full mana is a waste of mana.  For me that usually means condemnationx2 and mark of kings on every mob.  If you have to heal a group member during a pull, forego a nuke or two.  If you have to expend alot of mana healing, stop nuking for a while.  If the mobs in the area have been resisting alot of your nukes (as often happens), stop nuking.  Do something else with your mana.  Always make sure you are 90%+ before each pull comes in but not FM.<br />
<br />
During the boss encounter, you will in fact have very little time to heal the members in your group, as all our clerics are usually employed in a CH chain to heal the raid tank, or sometimes we all spam heal the tank, depending on the particular boss.  In between your CHs you may have time to save that DPS who is getting riposted or AEed to death, but remember that DPS in this situation is nothing compared to keeping the raid tank alive.  KEEP THE RAID TANK ALIVE.  Nothing else matters.  In these situations you will have to rely on your healing cousins the druids, necros and pallies to watch out for your group's health.  BTW, we usually have druids and necros in our heal channel as well.  The druids can be added to the CH chain or if the raid tank has very high HP they are employed as patch healers (since their "CH" would then be ineffective).  The necros are the mana batteries.  Clerics who are LOM will message the channel for mana, and our necros will mana feed them.  Patchers will usually each have their own personal mana battery.<br />
<br />
During the setup for the boss encounter we will have an established CH chain.  Who starts the chain, who goes after who, what the delay is, who will NOT be in the chain and act as patchers instead (usually those with the largest mana pool/fastest mana regen).  For example, if there are 7 healers on the raid, we may assign 2 as patchers and the rest on the CH chain.  Patchers are very important at the beginning of the encounter, as the tank's HP may drop very rapidly at first, when the boss is not yet slowed and the CH has not yet landed (sometimes the boss is unslowable, then it gets really fun).  <br />
<br />
Another thing, it may be a good idea for you to buy a horse, cuz sometimes bosses will automatically aggro anyone sitting down.  If you don't or can't own a horse, then just stand up and pray to your god to have enough mana to last the fight.  Either that or PST a necro. o)<br />
<br />
Here is my macro for a raid CH:<br />
line 1: /cast 1<br />
line 2: /3 Complete Healing on Jormungand in 10 seconds<br />
line 3: /cast 1<br />
line 4: /delay 35<br />
line 5: /3 Gozer start casting NOW!<br />
<br />
A couple points about the macro: /cast 1 is listed twice to cover any fizzles that I may have.  If you're on a tight schedule (e.g. a CH chain), having a fizzle is very very bad for the health of your raid.  Having two /cast commands reduces your chances of not casting successfully to basically nil.  The delay depends on the boss (and to some extent the tank).  If a boss hits harder, the delay should be less.  I've had to heal for mobs that have a 0 delay.  Basically the delay is how many tenths of a second the computer waits after receiving the command before it displays "Gozer start casting NOW!" in the heal channel (for me it's /3).  BTW, if you are in a CH chain, make sure the heal channel has its own window, cuz you don't want to miss the "you are up NOW" from the guy in front of you, or you might end up having several dozen dead people being very upset with you.<br />
<br />
General raid advice: ALWAYS listen to whatever the raid leader (RL) says.  Move when the RL says.  Stop when the RL says.  NEVER go wandering off or exploring or left-clicking things on your own.  You may get killed because of it.  The raid may get killed because of it.  If you don't like being told what to do, don't go on raids.  If you are an independent-minded free spirit, don't go on raids.  If you are not a very patient person, don't go on raids.  Raiding is about teamwork.  Teamwork requires leadership, someone at the top who knows what he/she's doing.  Leadership requires commands and obedience of commands.  I can't stress this enough.  I absolutely hate it when one of our raids is screwed up because a single raid newbie does something he shouldn't have, like when the RL says "hold at this position", he goes ahead to 'scout' and ends up aggroing a mob or six, or clicks open a door, or falls down a pit and gets himself kilt.<br />
<br />
A word about camping out: sometimes the RL will call for all clerics to camp out.  This means that the raid is going down to hell.  Why clerics and not others?  Cuz we have clicky sticks that's why.  Why camp out?  Cuz we've been healing and we are almost certainly on the mob(s) aggro list.  When the raid is all dead and the mob has (hopefully) left the premises, we log back in and rezz our comrades.  It's helpful to have an alt in these situations, cuz you can log your alt and communicate with other clerics, people who may still be alive at camp, the RL, etc.  How to camp out?  This is an active area of debate as far as I know.  Some people /quit out.  Some people /sit and /camp.  Which is better?  I'm still not absolutely sure, since I've only experimented with both a limited number of times.  As far as I have been able to tell, /quit seems to be the better choice.  They both seem to take about 30 sec for your toon to log out, but sitting to camp will almost certainly jack you up on the mob's aggro list, especially if you can't leave the area to log out and you have to sit down in the midst of battle with peeps dying all around you.  How do I know /quit takes about 30 sec?  Cuz that's about what it takes in real time for me to see my status on the character selection screen after I type /quit.  In any case, when you log out and go back to your character selection screen, you will see if you made it or not by looking at whether you toon is geared or not.  If he/she is neked and is back at your bind point, sorry, you died.  In any case, when the RL calls for a campout, run as far from camp as possible to a safe area, put up DB or DA, and type /quit.  If you can't run, DA up and just quit and pray that you are on the bottom of the mob's aggro list.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anything else atm.  I'll edit this message if I remember more stuff...&#123;slick}<br />
<br />
Edit: a note about the /tar command.  You have to be fairly close to your target in order for /tar to work.  In my experience, that means somewhere around a range of 100 (heal range).  This is an otherwise very useful command, cuz during a raid there are so many people that it is very hard to left-click on the right guy.....</td>

Well i have to respectfully disagree with Meatwaggon here...LOL<br />
<br />
I am in charge of our healing channel with help from another senior member in our guild and i would flip knowing that i have a cleric nuking her ass off instead of doing what she is suppose to be doing ..which is healing. <br />
<br />
Example, if you are doing rings in PoE which requires ALOT of attention from the clerics because you ALWAYS have someone getting hit( risk of aggro is immensly high due to people not listening no matter who it is..MA/SA/TA/RT/chanter/fellowcleric who got agro by healing....no matter what you always have someone'ass to cover. If a cleric yells out I AM UNDER DI!!! means very well that she or he is going down within the next few seconds...what happens if yoiu are currently casting a nuke? If your on a horse...that cleric has time to die before you even dismount/duck and target and cast.I agree we have help from druids/shammies and pallies...but that is not their first role and really not in fact to cover our asses cus we are busy nuking away. Chanter agro is very big in higher end zones...what am i saying...chanter agro is very big period,lol, so your chanters need special attention as well. A chanter alive is always more useful then that 1k-2k nuke you just landed on so and so.Keeping MoK or MoR on a mob i agree is very useful......We have a battlerez/buff/DI cleric who can take care of that. We are not considered part of the dps on a raid we are considered as dps "stabalisers"...keeping the "real dps" inc.<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally agrr that on a raid the #1 rule to follow is to listen and pay attention i can not stress that enuff.:p<br />
<br />
i would like to add that myself enjoy being a "battlecleric" ....i also like nuking away...but there are times for it...not on major raids.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">LOL, perhaps our raiding experiences are just different.<br />
<br />
When I'm not in the raid tank's group, I heal maybe once every 2-3 mobs.  The rest of the time I'm sitting with a full load of mana and nothing to do with it.  I have been on few raids where I feel stressed out to the point of having to constantly watch my group HP window to the exclusion of anything else, as would be required if one of my group members has the potential of dying in a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I guess the point is that it's situational.  If you're in an environment where any of your group members may potentially die in the next few seconds, no right-minded cleric would be attempting to pull off 6 second nukes during a pull.  Who does that?  On the other hand, if your mob is not bouncing around, or CC is working fine, you have all the mana in the world, and your groupies are not in danger of instant death, NO ONE including the RL should begrudge you your nukes.<br />

You are mixing up the argument here.  This quote has nothing to do with nukes.  I was referring to these classes in the context of a BOSS encounter, and I am in a CH chain.  In this case, I would not be casting any nukes under any circumstances anyway.  If I am in the middle of a 10 sec CH on the MT, you think I'm going to duck out and patch my ranja who is going down to hell as I cast?  No.  I type /g PATCH and continue with the CH.  When that pally in my group sees PATCH, he will usually AE heal.  Or the druid or necro will patch like I asked because they see the same ranja going down.</td>

<br />
Myself dont have time to nuke, i dont even have any nukes memmed during a raid.<br />
I apologize for mixing up your point. :P<br />
<br />
another advice for anyone who uses a cleric channel..is to avoid any type of useless jabber ( YA like thats gonna happen...my cleric channel is the juicyest channel going on during a raid  lol )<br />
<br />
but what i mean is to make it very simple.<br />
<br />
example <br />
<br />
line 1 > /cast 1<br />
line 2 >/1 (#1) %t ...........(name of next cleric)<br />
line 3 >/cast 1 (again in case of fizzle)<br />
<br />
<br />
That is all...no need to tell the next cleric to start casting because if they are paying attention they should have their count once they see their name .<br />
<br />
and the second cleric has (#2) in front of the targets name to indicate to those who do pay less attention where we are on the rotation.<br />
third cleric has (#3) ect....<br />
<br />
You will make you own adjustments to raid style as long as you progress and you will see what fits you best...the best way to learn is to experience it<br />
<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Unless the raid is just very cleric heavy, it's usually better to stand there looking sexy at FM rather than nuking/melee/etc.  It never really hurts to toss in a nuke every now and then, but raid clerics shine in the few moments of utter chaos when they turn a sure wipe into a success rather than through the whole of it adding DPS.<br />
<br />
However, if you're cleric #12 or you haven't found someone who needed healing in 30 minutes, then pretend you're a wizzie and kill stuff.  Clerics aren't required to be bored all the time, they're just supposed to play very conservitively on raids.  <br />
<br />
Until you're comfortable with raiding though, I wouldn't even mem a nuke.  However, once you're familiar with raiding, then use your judgement to know when to do what.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Depends on the place and your raid makeup if you should add DPS or not. Often getting to places in Luclin I find myself nuking and meleeing more than healing. Same goes for many Tier 1 PoP raids until getting to the target. Of course the harder things hit and the less Clerics you have, the less time and mana you have to add DPS. Also the safety factor, you don't want people getting killed on the way to your target, as that slows things down more than you not nuking would.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've never been on a raid, but from just reading this thread, the best advice I can give is "Ask someone you are raiding with who has been at it longer than you".  Clearly, everyone here has their own style that works for them.  And I will not say that their style is wrong.  But when your raid leader (or someone associated with the raid) is yelling at you for nuking rather than sitting and medding up, "The people on EQCleric said that's what I should do" won't cut it.  The best way to get better is to pester the people in charge with questions.  I'd recomend doing that during some off time, rather than any time related to the raid.  Before the raid, everything is too crazy while trying to get organized.  Naturally, during the raid is right out.  And after the raid, most of the people in charge probably don't want to hear the word "raid" for the next three weeks.</td>
