<br />
logical arguement i thought, im a human like anyone else, no one donates for rezzes anymore at least a please or a thank you or nicely asking is in question right? I guess this paly didnt think so.<br />
<br />
i get tells along the lines of "you dont have to be a F***ing D*** about it." and then the biggest blow of all "Looks like i know who not to invite next time i need a cleric" /sarcasm.<br />
<br />
since that im about 30 AAs stronger and thats because i dont lvl that much unless i feel like it lol. <br />

Normally I would say no since it's lazy, but I was in a good mood so I gave him some. Once he had the coin - no "ty" or nothing! Just took off to do whatever. So I said to him "your welcome..." and of course I got harsh language back. I told him not to bother me again for assistance, but obviously he got what he wanted.

When I was done screwing around, I went to Butcher Block. Found there were a couple of lvl 2's there busily killing stuff, so I shout that I was giving away free armor. Those 2 show up. I ask if they needed any of what I had. One of them says " OH, I thought you might have something good. Could I just have a few plat instead?"  OMG.. I gave the true newbie all of the armor I had, and even thru in 2 tailored backpacks to boot.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My Guild has a "pay it back" policy, where after we reach a new lv, we return to our Newbie zones and buff/ heal/ donate dropped armor/weapons to newbies. This policy, most of the time, brings out the worst in other players as they loose composure and try to get all that they can from us. All we ever ask in exchange for the armor/weapons is that when they gain better, they pass it along to other newbies that could use it. Maybe 99 out of 100 sell off the stuff BUT......<br />
<br />
Out of all the dozens upon dozens of newbies I myself have helped in this way over the years, there are 5 of them I know by name that still send me friendly /tells to say Hi or ask advice, hail me when I am in the zone, or in some cases /roleplay with me. Heck, I was in the PoK a few nights back and looking for Kei when one of the Enchanters refused my 50pp donation. confused, I asked why and she told me that I had generously helped her Alt Cleric and that Ext. Kei was free whenever I found her!!  WOOHOO! Talk about a sweet return for a Brigadine Tunic and a Vellium mace!<br />
<br />
All this to say, YES, there are alot of Jerks out there, but NOT all of them are.. somewhere hidden amoungst all of them are a few great players like us.. and to stop helping all newbies makes us a little more LIKE those jerks.. besides, you never know what might happen.... new friends, new guildies, or maybe just another nice player on your server.. and Lord Knows we could all use a few more of them..  right?</td>

As to beggars, I say piss on 'em.  As was said by Phixin, the ones that are busy working their ass off are the ones that are deserving of anything I decide to hand out.  Had a niely twinked FRG WIZ come up to one of my alts in the Bazaar just the other night and ask if I could give him a couple pp to buy a trader's satchel.  My reply was "hell no".  Then there was the bard twink, decked out in all Validous Custidous Plate Armor and wielding 2 Centi LS...and claimed they didn't have any money to pay me for Temperance, but "plzzzz I need Temperance".  /rolleyes <br />

So I casted my 0% rez on him cuz he didn't lose any exp anyway. And the guy paid my 20p. So there are ppl out there that appreciate what we can do and are willing to show it with plat.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">well, i've had the pleasure of being around since eq came about. on one character or another.<br />
i've seen alot of people come, and alot of people go. What bothers me is that usually the Nice,<br />
good, and friendly people are usually the first to leave because of the other people. But beside<br />
the point, back before kunark it was really easy to Make someone in Everquest's day, A couple <br />
plat or gold could buy almost a full set of leather from a vendor, and if you gave it to a druid<br />
that was in qeynos or freeport endless thanks came your way for minutes if not hours on end<br />
telling of how much it helps them. Even back then it was so simple to help someone out by <br />
retrieving a corpse or getting their gear for them, Back then i dont think anyone below level 45<br />
had even heard of a res.<br />
<br />
Now the vision is distorted. time has changed, and change has perverted all of what Everquest was.<br />
Now it's geared to make people INTO the mean and retarded people that now mass populate the game.<br />
All we can do is strive to be nice, play our class good, Get into a guild with people that we can call friends. And when the time comes for us to do something to help someone out, we do it. Because were not the mean and retarded people, were the kind of people who help even if someone doesnt deserve the help. Kinda strange me saying something like this. Because i'm mostly known for "hate" in my guild on my Wonderfully overpopulated Fennin Ro. <br />
<br />
We help because thats what we do, Some classes become hero's by tanking Rallos Zek the Warlord. Others by doing awesome Crit damage DPS. We become hero's and remain them by helping.<br />
<br />
/shrug sometimes i make myself ponder to many things.. <br />
<br />
/sigh i miss old everquest, before kunark came out and poluted what i liked so much.</td>

I recieved two tells, one was HEY this is (Soinso whom i think is a total jerk), how much you want? I replied 2k) I make the armor, it is not a big deal, but i hate the way this person plays, so screw em, pay me for my time.  SEcond tell was a "go ahead, give me a good laugh, how much?"  I did a /who all XXXXX ... shows a 30 cleric dwarf.  I replied hmmm, good laugh, 1200pp.  His reply: " that is a fair price, unfortunately, i will never see that kind of cash, GL to you on your sale. <br />
<br />
/em falls over in a dead faint cuz of a nice response<br />
<br />
I sent him a tell to meet me at the bank if he was not busy.  he came, i inspected.<br />
<br />
LEVEL 30 still in NEWBIE gear, i was in shock, had not seen that before on Lanys.... <br />
<br />
I put the arms in his trader window and asked him to "try them on" .. they looked good clashing Brown with all the other multicolors he had on, cloth, ringmail, some bronze .. :)  As soon as i saw them on him, I said : " merry Xmas" and walked away<br />
<br />
<br />
This guy followed me, tried to give em back and said ARE YOU SURE? HOLY BRELL REALLY? <br />
<br />
/em warm fuzzy feeling<br />
<br />
I told him the only thing was when he upgraded them to give them to someone who NEEDS.. and he would know the difference. <br />
<br />
10 minutes later <br />
<br />
XXXX tells you YEAH and he was really nice, he quoted me 1200pp before he just GAVE em to me.. :)  <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">VERY nice Pomedic.. You just might have saved a newbie from becomming a NooB with that one act of kindness. With a bit of luck, that player will continue playing, reminded of your kindness everytime he opens his inventory and will feel the urge to do the same to others.. <br />
<br />
As Clerics; or even as Players, we encounter hundreds upon hundrends of others.. and if these acts catch on and are passed along to only a few of them.. well there are a few more "Good" players than there were before, and thats comforting to me.<br />
<br />
Newbie players are players who have nearly NO skill in the game whatsoever so what info they gain in the early stages of their lives, will form their playing ways. Newbies see NooBs acting like NooBs and they figure thats how they have to act to advance in the game.. Newbies that encounter someone who "Pays it down" or helps newbies with info, tips and minor items that dont completely unbalance them at their lv will probably grow into players who will do the same as we do.</td>

They had said for 200 pp and being the broke one I have been lately from things rotting on my trader and 1pp donations for buffs I jumped on it.  Well, I get there rez and then buff/heal and voila 20pp.  200 was a typo it seems. Then they start with the spam to PL them.
