These days I make sure to voice my opinion about a persons actions in group as soon as I see it happen. If they don't bother listening and they keep jepoardizing the group and my life, I try to find a replacement and let everybody know I don't have time for that kind of mindless playing.<br />
<br />
It's not that I think I'm better than anyone else. Hell, I'm sure most clerics are better clerics than me, and thus I try to play better every day, but there are some things you shouldn't even bother putting up with.<br />

This is a game and all that kind of behavior is going to achieve is that you get upset, and then the game is no longer fun.<br />

But there was this one group in OT; I was lom because not only was our puller pulling, but so was our rogue, and I don't think this rogue knew how to evade despite my explaining it to him several times.  Consequently I was spending a lot of mana on keeping him alive.  The funny thing was, he had some REALLY nice gear, so he obviously had a higher level character...  Anyways, I politely asked for one puller only over and over again, as did our group leader.  I let his health drop, but I never let him die.<br />
<br />
Finally he almost got me killed and our group leader kicked him out.  It was kind of funny, after she booted him she quicky said sorry to the group for having to do it, but everyone was already /cheering her.  LOL<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">What a horrifying idea.<br />
<br />
When I'm in an exp group, my job is to keep people alive and I <i>do</i> that job to the best of my ability.  I have never intentionally allowed someone to die in my group, and I tend to feel personally responsible for every death that happens, whether it was really my fault or not.  I hate that feeling of guilt and I'll do everything I can to avoid it.<br />
<br />
The idea of a cleric intentionally letting someone die disturbs me.  It's like imagining a tank who won't taunt off his cleric because he doesn't like her... in situations like that, you don't have a group at all.  What you have is a bunch of people who're too selfish to help each other, and it's going nowhere: time to leave.<br />
<br />
The relationship between cleric and tank is so trusting that it's almost symbiotic.  The tank stands there and taunts a critter that can kill him in under thirty seconds because of the trust he places in his cleric.  The cleric stands there and heals that tank in the knowledge that it will irritate the critter because she trusts the tank to taunt it off her.<br />
<br />
Betraying that trust is wrong.<br />
<br />
If there's someone in the group I genuinely don't like, then I'll leave.  Clerics are in demand enough that I can get another group pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way:-<br />
<br />
When someone dies in an exp group, that affects <i>your</i> reputation, particularly if it was preventable.  Do it more than once or twice and your reputation will suffer, and it's a lot harder to fix faction with the playerbase than it is with monsters!<br />
<br />
Your reputation matters, and people will remember.  Do your job as well as you can - <i>all</i> the time.</td>

For what reason i have no clue,  but he would get 2 or 3 mobs and would start running in front of our group screaming for help while our tank was already tied up with another mob.  I about fell out of my seat watching him run from one side of my screen to the other screaming for us to get the mobs off of him.

It has been a very long time since I have in that manner though.  As the server has matured I find myself in the same old groups/raids etc with the same old people that all play well together.<br />
<br />
In my usual group I have purposefully let someone die (usually the ranger or myself playing the second warrior) when the fight is tough and to ensure mana for the groups success on a kill.  People die and the way some fights turn out you must decide who dies.  Guaranteed not everyone will be full health...all critters dead...great loot recieved every fight <wink>  Weller the friend who plays the ranger knows that I am the 2 box warrior that dies most and he realizes that either he or I will take the fall first first the group.  We are getting better at being able to handle Kael Arena giants though so this happens rarely this week.</td>

Im not sure you understand the nature of what the original posters intent was.  Even if you do, I really thought I would see a post of this nature even earlier in the thread.  I fyou have had nothing but super people to work with, gratz to you and your tanks.  In four years I dont have the time to put up with children.  <br />
<br />
When I first started eq 4 years ago, the cleric was the class that never made any money, couldnt solo (and still shouldnt imHo) and was the "throw around class"  I never could understand that and voiced it several times.  It should be known in a group that the cleric calls when to pull, when to med, when to otm, etc.  The groups cleric is the "God figure", and should not be treated better than anyone else as such, but with the proper respect.  While i think there are more clerics out there today than there once was, there have been so many times, even in our guild, that we have not been able to go somewhere if we could not find a cleric.  Letting a group member that doesnt understand this sweat a little bit, is not only fine, but encouraged...   The symbitoic relationship that you speak of happens when there is already a trust formed, not in the pick up group.   Sides, in my (little) clericing exp, its the pallys stun thats going to get the mob off me anyway.</td>

You know, some of those guys may be showing off and bragging about their equipment a bit. I play a monk though, and I call when my mend is up and try to tell the group healers it is up and that I'll be using it at ##% health because I'm TRYING TO SAVE THEM MANA. In such a case I'd think you would need the lesson in humility. I still have trouble finding groups that give me the courtesy of looting, but I make appreciative notes of who is trying to make my job easier. That monk saying, "don't heal me, mend is up" gets my respect. (Interestingly, I rarely find a cleric or other healer that honors that request. It's rather frustrating.<br />
<br />
Adding directly to the topic, I don't think I've ever deliberately let someone die. Being in the pre-50 grind I don't have as many choices in pickup groups as I'd like and must sometimes take whatever is available, but I try to stay out of groups with people who really annoy me or are going to get me killed.<br />
<br />
There was one person fairly recently that I found myself not buffing him or not fully buffing him. A wizard who was rude and constantly aggroing with overburns. At one point during an over pull I also had to make the decision to heal a melee who also was going to die instead of the wizard.<br />
<br />
Call that vindictive if you want, but I think that both actions were still wise and justifiable gameplay. Buff mana went right back into him through heals (he took more than the tank and any other group member combined, easily), and when I was forced to choose the melee took those hp and used them at least 5 times better than that wizard would have just thrown them away again.<br />
<br />
I play so that I don't have to decide between two people who dies, but it happens. When it does, I do what everyone has to do and choose who can help the rest of the group live. I made the right choice.</td>

In what way is it frustrating?  The point I was making originally is this.  You have the necro or shaman canning in one form or another and they get to like one bubble of health.  Its an instinct when playing a cleric, its hard as hell to not drop at least a celestial health or light heal of some type on them... but they get.... PO'd.  However, then you say ok... ignore so and so... when they die, you still get chewed out.  I tell necros and shamans, if you tell me not to heal, I will not heal unless you say so.  period.  Make no mistake I appreciate someone helping me learn manna conservation, if and when that is truly the case.  But for a melee to get ticked off for being healed??? <br />

I know I am a mother hen when it comes to a group. Any death no matter whose fault I feel bad for. One of our bard friends was being cheesy and said he was jealous cause the tank was gettin all my roses (my heal messages always have a rose in them pointing to the name ------&#123;------<&#123;@ name)   <br />
<br />
He started pulling and then on purpose he would go down to one yello of health before returning to camp causing me to CHeal or Supernal Remedy his ass.  Drove me nuts and the tank was about to take HIM out for it.</td>
