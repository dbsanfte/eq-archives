<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'm level 40 and have done a good amount of LDoNing in the last 15 levels.  Some advice for what to expect:<br />
<br />
You'll have to jump through some hoops to participate in adventures, and I had to ask a lot of strangers to figure out how so this might help you;):<br />
<br />
You'll need to talk to a certain person in your home city who will tell you a bunch of stuff about the Wayferers (which stores in your Journal) and then tell you to go see someone in a Wayferer camp. If you're a high elf, it's a blond high elf in the first floor of the Shop of all Holos, and she'll forward you to Vual in the camp in Butcherblock, which is the one most nearby.  Talk to Vual, he'll quiz you on what you know so far, and you can answer his questions by looking back in your Journal.  Then he'll give you an Adventure Stone, which will allow you to use the Magus (teleporters) to move from camp to camp.<br />
<br />
Some things about the adventures:<br />
<br />
Pulling in LDoN usually requires that someone Pacify pull or otherwise break up rooms.  If you have no paladin or enchanter in the group you might be told matter-of-factly that you'll be Pacifying.  My experience with this has been that I try to run ahead as my group is finishing and start taking care of a room so that we can move on quickly.  I have never actually been the one that pulls, but am the one determining which mob the puller will pull next.  Usually the ranger/warrior/whathaveyou /assists off of me and pulls what I target.<br />
<br />
There are booby traps littered around in LDoN so resist buffs + cures are sometimes necessary.  Don't go clicking or bashing on coffins, boxes, etc. 'cause you'll sometimes set off a nasty trap.  (Last night one killed three of my group members in less than 5 seconds).<br />
<br />
I use Celestial Health almost exclusively in LDoN because of the low aggro it generates.  Typically the only time I die is when I have to resort to insta-heals and generate more aggro than I can survive.  Since the adventure is timed I always bind right outside so that I can run back in when I die and recommence healing.  You can use the 30 extra minutes after the timer runs out to do rezzing, or wait until after those 30 minutes are up and the corpses are all kicked out of the zone to take care of it.<br />
<br />
Hope that's sorta what you were looking for...</td>

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well I'm usually the puller about 70% of the time, I dont really like waiting for the puller to realize which mob isnt pacified so I just pacify all but one and use strike (our first DD) to pull the creature and run and stand behind/next to the MT so he can get aggro fairly quick. <br />
<br />
ALWAYS ask who is the MT/ML before the adventure starts, also always ask if you are doing NBG or FFA on drops so that if something drops everyone is on the same page on who can roll. But if you dont care about any drops/cash then I guess that tip is kind of worthless.<br />
<br />
Also dont let people run ahead of themselves, try to contain them in the room you just cleard while the puller/pacify guy(s)/girl(s) run up to the next adjectant room to pull. It's nothing worse with those curious people that need to run into the next room that you havent even started pulling from and manage to get the whole room on you.<br />
<br />
Also SNARE! it's really important to have a snare/stun/root ready for when they run, you wont really survive for long if one of them runs away at full speed into the dungeon and bringing all of his friends from a few rooms (happened to me ugh).<br />
<br />
I think that's the tips I have..oh and if you can try to bring KEI everytime..will make your stay a bit more pleasant ;)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</td>

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In LDoN the mobs don't respawn, so you basically crawl through the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Until you can get KEI at 45, try to invite a backup healer or someone that can pull, slow, or mez. This includes another cleric, druid, shaman, bard, enchanter, paladin(at lower levels). If you have to pull and do all the heals through a LDoN adventure it will be fairly tough unless your MT is exceptional. <br />
<br />
If you don't have an ench or bard to pacify, you will probably have to pull. Pacify all you can and pull with something low aggro like your level 1 DD. Another good thing for pulling is to download the in-game maps, these make a world of difference when knowing where to go next and tracking nameds as well. <br />
<br />
As mentioned HoTs are very good when dealing with adds, they give you more time until you need to throw a heal that generates aggro.<br />
<br />
Through the 40s in LDoN damage output isn't quite as important as having no downtime. This is the toughest time to do LDoN or any exping as a Cleric. Try to fit at least 2 damage dealers into the group out of monk, ranger, rogue, wizard, beastlord, magician, necromancer, berserker, druid.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I would begin with the Mistmoore Catacomb dungeons which originate in Butcherblock.  The mobs in that dungeon are undead for the most part and don't run, so snare is not really needed.  Also, Butcherblock tends to usually have a fair number of folks who are LFA (looking for adventure) and getting a group is usually not a problem.<br />
<br />
Be sure and mem either or both of Divine Aura/Divine Barrier in case you need invincibility for a few seconds to get aggro off of you.  Just remember that you can't cast any other spells while aura/barrier is on.  Along this same line, be sure and set up a "HELP" hotbutton to let your melees know that you  are getting pounded on and need assistance!  That button has saved my chili more than once.<br />
<br />
Also, as the cleric, you are usually detatched from the actual combat, and therefore, should be watching over the battle and calling out necessary information to your team.  Things such as "ADD" or "ROAMER"  or the dreaded "RUN TO ZONE".   You are the eyes for your team.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, never hesitate to call for a med break if your mana gets low, and don't let your group rush you.  No mana equals no heals equals dead team.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">A lot of very good advice in this thread!! <br />
<br />
I have done about 100 adventures with this char and about another 50 or so with my alts. A lot of these I have been GL (group leader) and put together the team. This is what I am looking for as a rough guide<br />
<br />
Tanks - preferably 2 big strong guys! Wars are ok, but SK or Pallys have more flexibility.<br />
<br />
Utility slot - A ranger might fit here for snare or a rogue for added dps. A good druid could provide the snare and dps via dots. <br />
<br />
C.C. - for crowd control a bard or a chanter is very important. The high up the dungeon, the more important this position is. With a very good necro you might get decent C.C. as well<br />
<br />
Nuker - Wizzie or Mage <br />
<br />
Slower - Sham or Beasties. These are your mana friends. A MOB slowed means far less heals.<br />
<br />
Cleric - Drus can do this in a pinch but you cannot beat clerics for the real dirty work.<br />
<br />
Not saying that you cannot be successful with a different lineup! I remember one EF dungeon where I went in with 3 rangers and never lost one of them. It is the odds of you completing the dungeon successfully just are not as good. <br />

Final rule: DPS is key. The more you have the faster you finish and the more you can cover for some mistakes and miscues.</td>

If the group insists, get the cleric as far away from the chest as possible. Make sure that you have cure poison and disease up. And then pray. Even better, zone out and come back for the rezzes!!</td>

<br />
If you need to use spells to determine whether the object is trapped or not, then you definitely do *not* want a bard or rogue trying to unlock it.  The use of spells would confirm that it's a magic-based lock/trap, and a bard/rogue will be no better able to open it than would any other class.  You would need the appropriate unlock spell, to go along with whichever spell line was needed to detect the magic trap in the first place.<br />
<br />
Rogues and bards can only use their skills to open mechanical traps, which the LDoN spells would be unable to detect.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ok on ldon's you have to be very mana efficent. Most Ldon's your moving at a very fast pace and you don't want to slow down the group by medding all the time. Towards the end I'm usually running low on mana and I say CHing tank only so dont pull aggro. Also someone made the comment here that warriors are just ok as apossed to sk's or Pally's I disagree. I love grouping with a real Warrior (tank) there is no one else who can get to 30% health and stay there for a period of time and go berserk and do more damage while you start your CH. Everyone else when at 30% health will either stop taunting or back off or stop hitting to cast a heal spell on themselves and if you start CH on someone other than a Warrior they will die before you complete it.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have to agree that being low level does help a lot. There is a 7 level range limit for LDON so if you are 41 then ideally you want to be in a group of all 48s as the level of the mobs in LDON are geared towards the average group level.<br />
<br />
Be PATIENT!! I can't stress that enough. You have to be able to sit on your butt and med and not heal unless it is absolutely necessary. It is going to be boring as hell and you WILL be tempted to jump in and melee a bit or try to help out by pitching in a nuke or an anti-undead spell, but DON'T do it!! Save your mana for heals, and do not heal unless the spell you are using will restore the maximum amount of hp. Casting a 600hp heal on someone who only has 300 damage is a waste.<br />
<br />
At 41 you will have Complete Healing already. Forget it. Keep Superior and Greater healing memmed and switch between them as appropriate or as mana dictates. Nobody at your level has 7500hp no matter how twinked or buffed they are, and you are restricted in how many times you can use it on the same person in a given amount of time anyway. Also keep both your Celestials memmed. Celestials do not generate aggro like heals do and may be more appropriate in some cases.<br />
<br />
It can save your ass to keep either Divine Aura or Divine Barrier memmed. If the crowd gets out of control and everyone is about die or run away, cast a Divine on yourself and run like hell for the exit. Gate can also be used for this purpose if you think you'll have time to get it off without being interrupted. <br />
<br />
After you have grouped a few times, you'll get a feel for who is good at their job and who is not. If you want to make your LDON experience more enjoyable, try to sniff out the bad players as soon as you can and don't group with them in the future. Even if it means you have to pass up one group and wait for another it is usually worth it because the bad players get their groups wiped out quickly and you don't want to be a part of that.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I give my advice NOT from the perspective of the cleric, FYI.<br />
<br />
If I could define a perfect LDoN (sub level 55), it would be 4 mages, 1 ench, 1 cleric.  In all honesty, the cleric isn't even needed in such groups.  A druid would probably be slightly better, unless it was an undead dungeon.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are good also, except that some of their power comes from their melee, which means they will often require some healing (but which they can usually do themselves).<br />
<br />
Necros are also a decent substitute, although not as good as mages.<br />
<br />
Assuming all members of group are competent, a pet/caster only group can do a hard mission in 20 to 30 minutes without anyone dropping to even half HP.<br />
<br />
Heal rate on pets is phenomenal.  Most fights last about 10 to 15 seconds, and the biggest problem becomes trying to keep the last nuker from wasting his or her mana.  Even without clarity it's a "screw".<br />
<br />
Counter to that, I've experienced a melee-only group once.  Some of the group members weren't outrageously twinked either, although we did the mission on Normal because we weren't sure how it would go.  30 minutes to completion, plus another 30 minutes to completely clear the dungeon.<br />
<br />
So my opinion is that traditional balanced groups, while perhaps safest in cases where the members aren't very skilled, are probably the slowest.<br />
<br />
I would choose caster/pet only groups first, or 1 cleric + 5 melee (ideally most or all DPS).<br />
<br />
Remember, shorter fights are safer.  Mobs that fall down in 10 seconds have little time to kill a player.</td>

Make sure everybody knows their role in the group. Recently having an issue with melee drawing agro away from the MT. Which means wasted mana on heals because everybody is taking damage.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The normal risk and the high risk are totally different games almost at my level. On the normal risk I never drop below 80% mana. And I must say that I use cheal and use it a lot. On tanks it is often the most mana efficient heal.  The tricky part is timing. Try to ensure that you are only hitting the MT with cheal AFTER he has acquired agro. If not, you become the target of the MOBS affection. The absolute best time is just as the MOB is being finished off to when the puller is running out for another victim. <br />
The fun thing about normal is that I can easily mellee a lot and still have mana to burn!!<br />
<br />
High risk is another thing altogether. I am often running LOM, not always enough to call a med break, but so that I must be very frugal with my mana. I never mellee on hards. I never nuke on hards. I can only concentrate on keeping the MT alive. He/She is often getting hit so much harder that I will have to start that cheal at 50 -60 instead of 30- 40. <br />
<br />
Love them both for variety!! hehe</td>
