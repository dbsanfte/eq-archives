<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">This is a post asking for advice.  If there's anything you can tell me on how to do this better, please do.  I'm open to trying new things when it comes to healing.  Here's the problem:<br />
<br />
I've been regularly grouping with a paladin for about a month and a half.  I've always enjoyed grouping with paladins and I've found that their healing ability compliments mine wonderfully.  LoH and short cast group heals are their specialty, but they can also do small burst heals in a pinch.  However, with this paladin I never seem to get the timing right.  It's like he waits to heal someone until I've thrown a HoT or he throws his group heal only healing one person right when my CH lands.  The second part I can deal with.  He might be twitchy even though people don't die from mistimed CH's very often.  Usually I duck out and start my cast again when the tank is at the appropriate level of health unless the mob really is tough.<br />
<br />
Ok, here are the things I've done that may hinder the situation.  <br />
<br />
1) I no longer spam group with heal messages except for CH.  I could better communicate when I'm healing if I put them back in.  I would, but it seems like, and I know I might be overreading here, he waits until I throw a heal and tries to beat me to the heal.  Seriously.  <br />
<br />
2) Also, since he's usually the MT except on hards I usually heal the puller first and then him when they're both reaching the CH hp level at the same time.  He has less hp and less AC so that often leaves him low when CH hits, but the the puller is going to run out before the mobs are dead and will run out with 25% health if I don't hit him soon (which breaks our flow if I yell at him and make him come back for a heal).<br />
<br />
3) If the enchantress (who is the pally's girlfriend btw) takes a beating, but isn't in danger of dying I usually cast SE on her.  It's more mana efficient than throwing SR and it'll keep healing if the mob doesn't quite get under control.  She's got enough hitpoints that on a normal mission she's not going to go down too quickly and I keep an eye on her visually to see if a mob is really giving her trouble.   Maybe she doesn't like HoTs and has trained him to heal her anytime she's missing health?<br />
<br />
Ok, so I can communicate better and I'm certainly willing to try it.  I'm just not sure if it'll help.  I've tried talking to him about it, but he's kinda sensitive about the whole issue.  He got his healing AA's first, probably because he and his girlfriend used to duo a lot.  So he feels like he should contribute as much healing to the group as I do (yes, he actually told me that).  We don't let him pull because, well, he's not good at it and the warrior is really good at pacing and at knowing how to pull a room.  The paladin's not horrible at MT, but he doesn't position mobs, and for the life of me I don't understand it, but he can't get aggro unless he absolutely shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
He's a really great guy though and I enjoy grouping with them both.  So what can I do to keep me from pulling my hair out and not crush his ego?  I feel like he's not happy because he doesn't have a set role like the other 3 of us and he's trying to do everything.  I don't want to discourage him from healing because there are times when he's indispensible (like on hards).   Any suggestions are appreciated.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">This is only my first thought on the topic, and I don't have the luxury of a regular group to give me any experience in the matter, so feel free to ignore me if this doesn't sound "right" to you...  but, well, maybe if you find a job to assign to the pally, he won't feel quite so out of place.  A few ideas in this direction: <br />
<br />
If there's a group member or two only taking a moderate amount of damage, then the pally could be specifically assigned to heal that person (or those people), with the two of you mutually agreeing to "cover each other" if the worst should happen (or possibly with the specific exception of hard LDoNs, where the rules change).  This could cater to his apparent desire to play the healer, without wasting anyone's mana or putting a groupmate in severe danger.<br />
<br />
You could try casually mentioning your heal over time - or just how *much* this complete heal does ;) - in an effort to subtly remind him that it *will* hit, and that any heal he throws before that will be a waste of his mana.  (At this point, it might be beneficial to point out all of the other things that his mana is needed for...  What do you *want* him to be casting?)<br />
<br />
You didn't mention what the ML arrangements are, but I've noticed (as I'm sure you have) that there's a significant difference in mana drain when a caster MLs.  Since he's not pulling, perhaps you could put him in charge of looting?  (If charisma is a problem, there are always ways around it.  Worst case scenario, he could be in charge of collecting the loot and transporting it (dwarven strength?), but let someone else (the girlfriend?) sell if his charisma is too terrible.  But then again, with a Kobold Jester's Crown and a couple of steins (not too mention that cha buff his girlfriend will have), he could make for quite the charismatic guy with minimal expense.  My barbarian rogue does it to balance out her pickpocket skillups.  ;)<br />
<br />
Finally, depending on the enchanter's general attitude, you might try talking to her about it.  If she has trained him to heal her, then you may be able to work it out with her first so that the paladin isn't receiving conflicting orders.  If not, then perhaps she could help you get to the root of the actual problem, or even pose potential solutions of her own.  Obviously she knows him fairly well.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you've put a lot of thought into the situation and you're honestly trying to find a way to make this group work.  Hats off to you for that.  I think that through a little bit of gentle trial and error, you should be able to fix the problem.  Try to help him find his place in a way that won't interfere with you or the rest of the group.  Good luck, and happy hunting!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I was once told by a friend (a paladin) that I'm spoiled because our guild and our allied guild have some of the best played paladins in the game.  I consider BSS a self-buff because it is very very rare that I don't have it. I have a paladin in my group 99% of the time I play.  Like every cleric, every pally has their style, but it helps to know what healing tools a pally has in comparison to ours.  <br />
<br />
In some cases, their heals just make more sense than ours.  Paladins have a heal that casts faster than our Remedy line.  It's the perfect "Oh S***" the caster is gonna die" heal.  It doesn't heal for a lot, but usually enough to get someone out of frenzy-aggro range.  Your pally friend has probably learned great panic healing skills from his enchanter girlfriend.  Let him deal panic healing her.  His heal is faster and will help him get the aggro off of her.  You can follow up with a bigger heal if needed.  I have always been of the school of thought that you can't have a too healthy enchanter.  The pally should also be panic healing you. <br />
<br />
Paladins also excell at group healing.  After a Divine Arb, the pally should automatically heal the group.  If there are more than people in the group banged up, the pally's wave line is best heal for the group.  If the group is really banged up, pally's have an AA group heal also. <br />
<br />
In a group where the pally isn't MA, he can't use his stuns.  In a group with an enchanter, he won't be rooting much.  He should have mana to burn.  I would ask him to leave the MA healing to you, let him wave heal at will (assuming the Warrior can keep aggro), and let him handle panic healing the chanter.  I would also tell him if the MA hits 10% heal, feel free to cover your heal with a fast one.  Any extra mana you have can be spent nuking or pacifying for the puller.</td>
