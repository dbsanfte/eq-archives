<br />
DRUIDS!! <screams an an unearthly bellow into the night><br />
<br />
It wasn't enough that I had to compete with them for the healer spot in a group for the first 39 levels of my existence!<br />
<br />
It wasn't enough that I saw druids frolicking around AND SOLOING in zones (like umbral) that even 5 levels later I couldn't even STEP into without a retinue of tanks and spellcasters there to aid me!<br />
<br />
It wasn't enough that verant/sony gave them a 3K COMPLETE HEAL and nerfed mine from 10k to 7.5k so that YET AGAIN, I have to compete with them for the healer spot in groups!<br />
<br />
It wasn't enough that most druids my level have better equipment and more money than I do because of their incredible soloing power in nearly EVERY zone.<br />
<br />
BUT ON TOP OF ALL THAT, my druid friend complained tonight because my HB overwrites his natureskin even though "natureskin is better and even has a regen on it"!<br />
AND IT REALLY IRKS ME THAT IT *IS* BETTER!! More AC, more HP, and a regen! /grr <br />
<br />
I LOVE being a cleric! When I started EQ I tried every class except a cleric because I'd always been a cleric in D&D and wanted to try something different. NONE of them worked for me. So then I finally made a cleric; it was like putting on a pair of favorite sneakers! <br />
It just *fit* me.  I don't even have any real alts because none of them are anywhere as fun as a cleric. <br />
<br />
So WHY is verant/sony doing this to us?  For one of those who are truly passionate and take joy in our characters, it breaks my heart to see them so easily tossed aside so one class can benefit at their expense. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not in any way against people who play druids. I just think we left "balance" by the wayside long ago.<br />
<br />
Thanks, had to get that off my chest.  /sigh</td>

Paladins don't go beyond a 90% rez (at 59), yet. I don't imagine they ever will unless clerics get a 98% rez or something. Though, necros also get a rez of sorts (51 spell Sacrifice lets them make emeralds which provide a 93% rez. You have to "sacrifice" a 45+ player who dies and can't recuperate exp loss with rez. To find someone willing to sacrifice to make these emeralds once seemed monumental, but these days has been trivialized to a large extent, unfortunately. Though still not as convenient as a cleric or paladin rez.)<br />
<br />
I doubt druids will realistically get a resurrection spell, it seems fairly ludicrous. And unless their resurrection spells were in line with clerics (which seems out of the question) it wouldn't even even begin to solve their alleged problems. Most druids (even on the at times delusional DG) seem to realize this and don't actually want rez abilities, it should probably be noted.<br />
<br />
In their defense, it is probably fair to say that Druids are the least desired of the priest class in high end groups. Shaman offer the best slows in the game and clerics offer rezes and the most mana efficient heals, bar none. Druids would like to be as desired as their priestly brothers and sisters. Many druids take this to mean that they are completely useless in groups, this I don't get. <br />
<br />
Druids basic problem is that they are a decent dps class and a decent healing class, they aren't extraordinary at either.  They feel to get groups,they need to be extraorinary at one of the two (or add a new category-slow to where they can replace shamans, etc. in groups). This obviously would make druids overpowered moreso than they are now. Most druids on DG dont' seem to recognize this and, of course, will lash out at you and eventually ban you if you say this out loud.  <br />
<br />
My guess is that a good druid who has a good reputation and has grouped their way to 60 probably can get groups fairly regularly. But, then again, I don't really know for sure. And it is fair to say that druids are not the most beloved class in the game. Their rants, soloing prowess, sheer quantity of them, and attention from VI and now Sony, embitter a lot of folks. The DrOOds out there tend to make a bad name for the many too. This probably makes them less popular in groups still. Still, a good druid, recognizes that they have a lot to offer a group. <br />
<br />
I would also guess that with the new dungeon oriented expansion allegedly coming out in a few months, Druids/Wizards will find their popularity improving substantially as their role of evacer will be more useful.</td>

The one thing that just sets me off is when they start doing their gimp ass heals while im in the group.  Tank engages mob isnt slowed yet...no biggy but the Druids start spamming your screen with "Patching healing Soandso for 1750."  By then you have been casting your Cheal and its about to land on an almost full health tank and you have to dismount and crouch it.  Meanwhile the druid blew 1500 mana tossing out 3 pathetic heals that could have been bested by one cheal.<br />

I read the ressurecton thingie for Druid's and had to LOL!  It was rather amazing to see this on their "wishlist" as it is just that...a wish.<br />
<br />
Now the other aspect of there "wish" was the bring a person to their body without any experience gain.  Kind of like a teleport you to the body so you can loot your stuff get back to playing type thing.  That in and of itself would eliminate downtime for a Corpse Retrieval.  Yet at the same time that type of teleport could be abused severely without some type of downside (like ressurection effects) associated with the teleport.</td>

Them kiting mobs...they run over you with their mobs, then they get to many and baam! you get a lot of mobs on you for some reason /rolleyes (this happens more with bards than druids tho /sigh)<br />
<br />
<br />
These new higher end raids...Nobody wants Virtue even. Everybody wants to do Blessing of the Nine, Ward of Gallentry and Kazad's Mark. It's like UGH! Why do druids get this uber buff that takes NO regents...while clerics have to suffer and cast spells that you have to pay around 50pp for? I don't have Hand of Virtue yet (50k!!! My guild will never be able to get me that spell) I think it might even be pointless to even try to save up for this if higher end raids don't even want it. It's just stupid that Blessing of the Nine + Kazad's mark = more than Hand of Virtue. That's 6 dots, i believe, while druids cast what? 2000m? ooo /grr</td>

/em is drowned out by the make-the-sun-look-dark light of enlightenment...<br />
Ahem, In D&D, Clerics main player buff spells, Not only adds to the allies armor class, and svFear...but to their BaB (base attack Bonus)!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
OUR SPELLS SHOULD ADD TO THE TARGETS ATK!!!!!!!!!!AND AGAINST THEIR RESISTANCE TO FEAR!!....And druids should have to have reagents for their spells...like a diamond for skin like diamond!Na. They should have to buy relative in cost "naturey" reagents for their spells. Maybe costing 4 reagents at 12pp each at average faction and CHA for pot9?<br />
If we have to get stuck with this shit. let them have it too. Even the self only ones...Thr group versions require 2 of the reagent to cast!!!<br />
<br />
I mean Druids highest buffs are Resist Elements(Ignores 12 damage from one energy type per round), and Barkskin (+3AC) Are level two spells. Obtainable at level 3...a mere 3000xp<br />
<br />
Clerics highest buff (Not counting Miracle) is level 8. Holy/Unholy Aura ( +4AC, +4 resistance and SR25 against evil/good spells), Cloak of Chaos/Law (as Holy aura, but Law/chaos where applicable)  obtainable at a minimum level (If you have high enough wisdom...you may not at level 15 unless you had a naturally really really high &#123;18} starting WIS, or altered it magically) of fifteem thats 105,000xp. Notice a difference?<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont start off saying druids level 2 spell gives 3AC while clerics lvl 8 spell gives only 4AC and some other stuff you dont know about. Because SR25 resist means the caster of the spell on you has to roll above 25 on his Spellcasting roll (+ modifiers for spell penetration if he has any) to even TRY and get the spell on to you. IF they do pass this roll, you get a +4 wil/fort/ref save to negate/half damage the spell. Also! Clerics get shield of Faith at level ONE which gives +2 AC, and AC is a very rare comodity. one AC is a fairly big thing.</td>

Soon as clerics get new spells, BAAM, you see a druid post on there about that spell is so ghey and that druids should get something like it, How druids get ripped off on this and that, etc.<br />
<br />
When I see a cleric quad kiting in a zone where the mobs are dark blue, NOT undead and they get decent experience for, i'll let druids' moaning and groaning slide. I mean, yea, sometimes they have a hard time getting groups cuz of clerics but c'mon, they are meant to be soloers anyways, least they have an alternative. Clerics basically HAVE to group if they want good exp.<br />

I do invite druids to my groups, they are good dmg dealers. (as the guy said above) I just hate when they are spamming heals in the middle of mine then call lom /sigh I don't like sounding mean but I have to say something to them.<br />

I do see very few clerics actualy out there on the neutral and goodie teams. Tons of druids.<br />

The evils complain about being jipped that 1k hp in raid situations, yet are currently leading and have the only guild on the server in the Eplanes. (excepting those few characters that came back from legends flagged).<br />

From reading these posts, I can understand how poeple would feel that all tihs is unfair. I was not aware the druid high level buff w/ regen did not cause a regent and am quite dissapointed by that.  <br />

Either way, I can own druids in pvp any day one on one, so I really dont care about them. Any class universally owned in pvp by a cleric is just pathetic.</td>

It was full of Geekery (Copywritten word, all rights reserved), D&D refrences, the idea that our buffs should give major bonus's to ATK, and the idea that the druids skin buffs should have a relative in cost (Costing a little more at SLNature...cuz thats the first one with regen) that is naturey. Like "A Rock" for Skin like Rock or something . Also our buffs should be improved by 30-40%. What VI really needs to do is scale back ALL druid abilities "Nuking buffing etc" and give them something UNIQUE.  Something useful that they can bring to the table in a group. Like maybe beter pacifies, for simple and easy single pulling, Something  like a tartgeted ATK tap. Balance! C'mon people, we can think of something to give druids.</td>

<br />
I must say though Maelarr is right. If they really want to be desired in groups they must give up versatility for something unique. Clerics are desired not for versatility but for 3 things. We can (pretty much) outbuff any class hp/ac wise, we have the best and most efficient healing, and when things go bad we can restore lost xp and circumvent REALLY long crs.<br />
<br />
And what do we get for all that? Constantly poor from ninja looters plus stone cost. Some warrior saying I loot alot because I need to buy equipment as an excuse. Sorry to derail the post in a rant but I must throw the bullshit flag. My gear isnt cheap either plus I have to buy the buffs YOU expect some of which can get insanely expensive due to rarity and also buy the stones to cast them on your worthless butt. Wah wheres my chanter friend and his charm duo. Not like it was bad enough I had to compete for the healer spot with shamans and druids for 24+ lvls 34 being what really seperates us from the ghetto healers. Sad that we have to bank on the relatively new low lvl rezzes to get a group like anyone wants to cast them. I feel so guilty like maybe I could have done more, something, anything to prevent it instead of my group clicking rez boxes.<br />
<br />
Ok rant off now again sorry to derail just making a point. If all the whiner druids spent one day in our shoes they'd run off crying and kiting. If they just understood what being a cleric entails just maybe they'd understand and get it through their hippie heads.<br />

Ok....... to all those dr00ds that think they are at the shite end of the stick... they really should look at us. Before, there was at LEAST a year+ bottleneck for epic, we lost alot of our competition due to nerfs and whining classes. The cleric class is one of the hardest classes to play and I don't really believe alot play it correctly. It's not just stand, sit, heal. Most people on this board actually know what they are doing (thank Innoruk), but there are MANY more druids that don't know how to play their profession correctly. Which is really funny in turn because they are really a "Jack-of-all-trades", I mean, HTF can you screw that up?<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that if any druid actually took a step back and noticed everything they CAN do and we CAN'T do and took it to heart, Norrath would be a better place. :D <br />

<font color="orange">*Belerion turns his rant off</font> <br />

I know I don't really make sense when I rant, but I'm just really pissed off at alot of druids. Man, they just need to hardcore nurf the dr00ds and say F#@$ anyone who complains. :D</td>

All begins to change at L34 as you say.  I keep both Sup Heal and Gtr Heal memmed so I can heal casters with the smaller heal.  The tanks are now telling the druids/shammies to stop wasting their mana healing and start DoTing.  I don't have to say a thing.  2 more levels to CHeal...</td>
