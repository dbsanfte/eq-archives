<td bgcolor="#4D4D73"><font color="silver">So.. what do you all do, when the game becomes a job, & is no longer fun.  Right now I have X amount of time to play the game..(x right now doesn't amount to much these days) now, divide that by at least 3/4 & that is the time I end up spending raiding. (I'm in a non raid, family type guild). I can't just say "no.. I don't want to raid tonight" when I log in & there's something going on, because I'm usually the only cleric on, & without me, the raid won't happen.  Then I get all sorts of Innuendo's & crap for making the raid a no-go, Because I'm being *selfish* because I just spent the last 2 nights raiding, & I don't want to again. /sigh <br />
Trying to find a group, during that time I'm not raiding, is next to impossible. (everyone's like.. "but you're a cleric.. you should have your pick of groups...") But when there's 5 other clerics sitting in PoT LFG higher level than you, you're gonna get passed up everytime. I've tried putting groups together, & are usually told something like "Sorry, have a cleric already", or "nope.. I want a higher level ceric". So. I end up farming something (which is usually painfully slow, cause I don't have a ton of damage output), Or tradeskilling (you can only do so much of that, before your arm starts to hurt, & your bank empties) Getting a guild group is tough as well.. they al want the D*** druids in their group, cause they can heal almost as well as I can, & they have Potc, for mana regen, & they also have actualy damage output.  Only time I get anything, is when someone needs a rez /grr  :( <br />
So.. wht to do?!?!.. If I quit the game for a while, my guild's screwed, cause none of the other clerics even try to do stuff with the guild, or even bother to log in half the time.<br />

Your guild should understand this as there are other things to do besides raid. If you want some freedom, maybe even leave the guild and roam free for a while. You can always join up with them or another guild later.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Take a break from the character or take a break from EQ for a little bit.  I've done this several times before when I was getting burnt out or frustrated.<br />
<br />
I'm in a family type guild, as well.  Between us and our ally guilds, we have guild events ("raids") several times throughout the week.  One thing everyone in the guild realizes and supports is that RL > EQ.  I'm the second highest cleric in my guild at 52, and currently the highest active one.  Do I feel pressured to be at every raid/hunt we do?  Heck, no.<br />
<br />
It's a shame your guild is so selfish as to lay a guilt trip on you for making or breaking their raids.  Maybe some of them should level up a cleric to give you a break or ensure there's more around?<br />
<br />
Another possibility is to keep your eyes open for a guild that will appreciate the time you can and will devote to the raids.  If you're like me, leaving a guild is no small matter; it's hard to avoid feeling like you may have betrayed them by moving on.  Ultimately, though, if they are reducing your enjoyment of the game, it <b>may</b> be time to move on.<br />
<br />
Of these all, I would try taking a break from your cleric or even a short break from the game first.  It will help you build interest in the game again, and perhaps finally make it sink into your guildies' heads that they are being unreasonable in their atttiudes and expectations towards you.</td>

<br />
I am also in a very small guild, and it's funny that this was mentioned.  This is how Merrybrook came to be.  Until Merry we had only 1 active Cleric in our guild.  He is the best, and I very much look up to him.  However, we cannot expect him to be on every time we need him and we cannot expect him to be there at our beck-and-call.  It's not fair to him, he pays to play just like we do, and he has his real life.  Everyone in the guild understands this and is very supportive.<br />
<br />
So, I made Merry.  I'm working very hard to get her up to the level where she will be able to successfully hunt with our guild and be a viable resource for us.  As it is our current 'backup' healer is our guild leader, she is a 56 Druid.  With the heals that she has available she does a TREMENDOUS job, and no one has ever complained.  But when we have our Cleric AND her together we are that much more efficient.<br />
<br />
Asking someone in the guild to make a Cleric alt to take some of the burdon off of you is a fair request.  It shocks me that your guild has not recognized this and <i>someone</i> volunteered their service already.<br />
<br />
As things are, I am having an absolute <b>blast</b> with Merry, and I'm very glad I decided to make her.  It's fun for me, it's good for the guild.  Everyone wins! :)<br />
<br />
I hope everything works out for you...<br />

<br />
Talk to your guildleader, let them know how you feel, and discuss the possibilty of having someone level up a cleric for raiding, or even recruiting more clerics. Don't let it fester, because you'll only end up resenting the dependancy that gets attached to our class.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, just let your guild know that you need some "you" time. If they are a family/friends type guild, then they should understand, and be behind you on that ;)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I agree with Dyschord's last statement.  Being a family type guild they should understand your needs and take them into account rather than just focusing on their needs.  If they continue to lay a guilt trip on you, or make you feel bad in any way, why stay with them?  It is first and foremost a game.  If it isn't fun for you then there is no point in playing.<br />
<br />
Personally I put the game down and don't even login for a week or so.  That refreshes my batteries.  Alts are great for that too.  I love my cleric but sometimes I just need to pull out the shadow knight or magician and kick some butt on things.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I just went through the same thing, regarding your guild. I could write my own novel, but I'll spare you the reading. Ultimately, though, I did leave my guild. I'll admit, I was in a dedicated raiding guild, I signed on knowing that, and I had been with the guild over a year, but for several months between our healer shortage and lack of healing leadership, I felt obligated to attend everything humanly possible. Aside from the lack of green spam, going guildless can be strangely refreshing for a while.<br />
<br />
As far as finding groups goes...well, I can't say I feel your pain because druids are never as good a healer as clerics are. They suffice in some cases, but they certainly aren't giving superior damage output as the main healer of the group. I don't know how much you have to fight other clerics for groups, but I know that at select times of the night, there is *nobody* lfg. During primetime hours, I just turn on LFG and sit in a zone I'd like to group in while I talk to people.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I believe everyone's pretty much hit the nail on the head.  Here are my suggestions.<br />
<br />
1)  Make an alt and tell your guild you're taking a mini EQ vacation and that you'll be back in 5 days.  Being guildless and little is refreshing, esp. if you go to another server (I personally like Firiona Vie).<br />
<br />
2)  Take a break from the game altogether.  Maybe you need 5 days or 10 or just 1.  However long you need, take it.  This is a game and is meant to be fun.<br />
<br />
You should, above all else, talk to your guild leaders about how you're feeling.  Keeping things inside will only cause you to become more resentful and that's not fair to your guildmates.  One day, you might just snap and scream at them, and they'll never know where it's from and get cheesed off.  You'll probably want to avoid any situations that might lead to that.  :)<br />
<br />
IF your guild thinks you're being a jerk about not wanting to raid all the time, I would look for another guild.  They obviously aren't taking YOU, the person behind the toon, into account, and that's not fair or right.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In my guild we have written into the policy that you cannot and will not be mean or look down upon ANYONE who does not or cannot raid. THey must respect the fact some people log on to go run with friends for a day or do tradeskills. THe Polices were written by military and ex military so thankfullly my guild understands RL> EQ.     Thats a reason why i joined. <br />
<br />
I also have a very unique situation but will explain later when you all get to know me. The old guild I thought was home for me said they were raiding guild of friends.....then the GL started abusing the members byt sending these guilt tells to people who would not raid on certain nights. Being shorthanded of clerics he threw me into the Main Healer spot while i was still trying to learn the ropes. I was gettin beligerant people who did not understand that Virtue costs 1k per cast per player and one dot. And be the only Virtue cleric on a dragon raid and TOLD to virtue EVERYONE ...... so of course we are gonna sit and wait for a FT2 cleric to med while she gets enough mana to Virtue 25 people. **sigh** My husband was......was an officer and saw how stressed the clerics were but we coudl do nothing to stop top leadership from abusing the use of thier members.......we left the guild and joined the guild I am in now......<br />
<br />
I am enjoying the game again. They understand i can raid maybe 2 times a week if kids and military allows but they love having me around whether its raiding or me harassing the men in guildchat.</td>
