<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">After reading the thread titled What makes a bad cleric, I found myself bothered a bit.  Seems so many times, the negative gets more attention.  I want to start a thread detailing what people think makes a cleric exceptionally GOOD.  I'm cutting and pasteing my reply from the bad thread, because I mostly detailed good cleric stuff.  <br />
<br />
While my cleric is only level 16, My shaman is 62, in a high end raiding guild. Let me pass some of the things I see that EXCEPTIONAL clerics do.<br />
<br />
1. Hot keys are your friend.<br />
A. Set up your hot key for your CH rotation to cast CH twice, with a (very) short pause between. In the event of a fizzle on your first cast, the second cast will catch it, and CH is on the way faster than you can respond to the fizzle message and retap the key, or click with the mouse.<br />
B. You can also hotkey your heal call, so everything gets done at the same time. Wouldnt be a bad idea to include /stand (or is it /sit off) to ensure that you dont forget to stand before you cast. If a big raid, set up CH rotations and call your CH in channel, then call the next person to CH. (example, somthing like "CH for %t. Pause 40 &#123;4 second pause}(more or less depending on how tough the mob is) Cleric x, heal now.) This does 3 things. Calls your CH, Casts your CH, and tells the next cleric to cast CH, all with one key stroke.<br />
C. Have a second and even third hotkey set up to quickly switch to second and third tanks in the event that MT goes down, or to extend rotation pause once slow lands.<br />
<br />
2. Use channels, and set up a healer channel. Use a noticable color, so you dont miss important messages. Have all the clerics in the raid (or even druids, pallis, shamans, etc if needed) in that channel. In a 72 person raid, the less message spam in main channels, the better. If the MT wants to hear the CH calls, have him join the healer channel.<br />
<br />
3. From a suport healers standpoint Shaman primary), my main job is to keep #1 my cleric alive so he/she can heal the MT, #2 keep myself alive so I can heal the overnukeing wizzies or druids, or the resisted shamans and chanters, etc alive. This only takes effect AFTER my primary class functions are complete. Malo, slow etc. I dont want my cleric to be distracted from their primary job of keeping the MT alive by having to spot heal other people.<br />
<br />
4. Clerics MUST be organized, flexible, and able to adjust with the battle. If the MT goes down, they have to instantly target and CH rotation on the secondary tank without missing a tic. If slow is resisted, they need quick CHs on the MT. If the mob is slowed, they need to increase the time between CH's so they dont go OOM before the mob is down.<br />
<br />
5. Horsies can be great for mana recovery, but remember, if you just cast CH as the MT drops, you are stuck casting CH for the next 10 seconds. Dont hesitate to click off Trigger so you can duck and get back into the action.<br />
<br />
6. Know your enemys ahead of time. Know what mobs you are going after, how much they hit for, and how fast. Its too late when you show up at the gunfight armed with a knife.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is more I'll think of later, but dont want to get too drawn out.<br />
<br />
Give me some more ways to be a good cleric.  :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Pretty good cheal rot info you have there!<br />
<br />
For me and my guild clerics we Always have a channel up even when not raiding.<br />
Durring Cheal Rotations We ALWAYS go over it atleast once! Lets face it even the best of clerics mess up here and there!<br />
<br />
My macro key looks like this: <br />
/cast 4 (My Cheal)<br />
/1 111 C-Heal inc on %T .. Soandso YOU are next! 111<br />
/cast 4<br />
<br />
I generally do not sit durring a rotation we are either in a zone i can use my mount or i use yaulp and rods.<br />
<br />
Few other helpful hints:<br />
<br />
1. /assist is your best friend!<br />
I always assist heal off the mob.. and ive found that the designated SA doesnt always work out so i use this to make sure! <br />
<br />
2. Divine Aura/Barrier  <br />
Always have both memmed, these have saved me and my group soooo many times!<br />
<br />
3. Im a big celestial user. i through this one anyone low on health not in immediate danger, my MA gets it a lot. Im lvl 60 and i find that till i get a few more lvls and new heals that this is more mana efficient then my other lines.<br />
<br />
Thats all i can think of now Im sure everyone else has some great stuff too :)</td>

<br />
I find that as I gain more experience playing that hotkeys are very important!  The time taken to type and or mouse click is affected by too many things (reaction time, typing speed, mouse sensitivity, lag etc.)  Having the hotkeys set up and using them saves so much time and is very steadfast in accuracy.</td>

<br />
1. being very aware of everyone else's status not to mention your own.<br />
<br />
<embarrassing story><br />
I died unexpectedly during a 2-3 Mob 'add' while healing everyone else and trying to crowd control like a chanter (root != Mez, root != Mez).  Surprised me but not my party, they wondered what I was doing, no-one actually said anything though.  Lol<br />
</embarrassing story><br />
<br />
2. Reading others gsays.  %T is MEZZED DON'T ATTACK %T.  Why is it that all chanters yell in CAPS?  Because they're used to no-one litening to them.  heh.<br />
<br />
3. Being aware of how fast people are being hammered by the Mobs.  So you know when to stand up and throw in the heal.  (Not that I'm high enough to fully comprehend this yet)<br />
<br />
4. Letting people know what you're doing when you start waving your arms is pretty essential.  Especially when you wave for 5+ secs.  This all comes down to Macros and hotkeys as has already wisely been said by others.<br />
<br />
5. Be patient and understanding with others.  Always be quick to Lol and forgive.  Everyone makes mistakes.<br />
<br />
So to summarize, pay attention, communicate well with others and remember, at the end of the day, its just a game and all in the name of fun.  Pretty much class independent I would think.<br />

<br />
1. Is "rarely" AFK. <br />
<br />
2. Is <b>always</b> aware of what's going on around them Whether it be down-time, mid-battle, mid-chain; a good cleric notices deaths, aggro switches, on-the-fly instructions.<br />
<br />
3. Always has macros set up for <i>any</i> conceivable situation. That includes pre-made macros for fellow clerics for on the fly chain additions, MT /target macros, hybrid /target macros, Mob /assist macro (for those that are graphically challenged and cannot look up on all raids), an /assist <head chain cleric> or <next cleric in line> macro for sudden tank switching, and a permanent /assist key for fast spot-healing.<br />
<br />
4. <b>Always</b> "spots themselves" in a ch chain. (You know, you fizzle, get interrupted, etc).<br />
<br />
5. Doesn't make a raid "wait" for buffs. <br />
<br />
6. Is <b>always</b> prepared for any situation wich may arise while traveling. That includes an invis item (GVD), possibly potions to be able to invis on the run (Invis is fickle!), as a back up. A Levitate item/potions, shrink item/potions. In general, be as self-sufficeint as possible. Use what is out there!<br />
<br />
6a. Has DA/DB, Target DA, and even a DA item, if you can swing it! Just remember to be kind, and let your raid/groupmates know you are attempting to DA/DB so they don't sit there trying to heal you, when they could be healing others. <br />
<br />
7. Is able to manage mana in any given situation, and communicates well with those around (People don't have ESP, and tanks can be dense!)<br />
<br />
8. Doesn't sit around while CR is going on. Be active. If you aren't ressing, help heal, drag, rebuff.<br />
<br />
9. Has the patience of a saint, and the thick skin to match. Deaths get blamed on us. Don't get emotional. If you know you did everything you could, then don't ever let other's anger ruin your day/week/raid!<br />

10. Has the sense to look out for themselves monetarily, without being a greedy whore! <br />
<br />
11. Looks out for group/guildmates. If you know you have people waiting for corpses to pop in a GY, especially at the end of the night/playing session, take a minute and wait with them(If you are in no real rush). Seems like a small thing, but people really do appreciate and remember it.<br />

I'm sure I'm missing things, but those are some of my personal guidelines.<br />

I would like to add having root up.  I have it in my last spell slot with a hot key.  Last night we were in the zone off PoD and we kept getting adds.  We didn't have a chanter so myself and the shammy were rooting adds and continuing our jobs.  I can't stand clerics that freak out when a mob hits them, just relax, root and move on.  Announcing you are rooting it with the hot key in /gsay will let the others know they've got another.<br />
<br />
I always keep DB up as well, you never know when you will need it.  And, you can always click it off.<br />
<br />
I think Dyschord mentioned this, but I always have a /assist key so I can assist the mob and see who is getting beat down.  Obviously this is for a raid scenerio, and works quite well.  :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I noticed one other tool that I use in groups and raids. Also hot key DA so when cleric draws agro you holler cleric invulnerable next healer up to alert group that you are out of healing mode for the next 18 seconds. This will allow tank if warrior to go defensive or pally to be ready for his loh besides other healers to assist tank. In raids have an oom key ready when in ch rotaion that alerts other rotation clerics to skip you while you can med. These 2 suggestions i believe can help save many a group.<br />

A good cleric does what is needed to keep the group/raid functioning without hindering their forward progress. Learns how to adapt situationally to keep the group not only alive, but also feeling comfortable to continue on.</td>

All this makes a good cleric, but I have always thought and have never thought all  this was as important as the experience that you bring to the guild or group.  I also thank attitude is important, I mean do you think a cleric with a bad attitude is really a good cleric in the long run.  Don't worry be happy and by all means have fun what you do<br />

I love seeing this!  I would like to further this a little and add that a good <anyclass> will notice the above things.  I'm shocked at times to see that someone has gone down mid battle, even in the midst of adds and see several people say what happened to soandso?!?  Stay alert!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Being a good cleric is about paying attention.  You'll need a decent connection and a bank of hotkeys and knowledge of a few basic techniques, but at the end of the day, the difference between the cleric who pulls the fat out of the fire and saves the day against the cleric who misses a heal and wipes the group, is basically about who was watching the screen and who was watching TV/closing a complicated trade deal in tells/cybering with the hot halfling/playing an alt on the other computer.<br />
<br />
If you're a raiding cleric, it also helps to have the patience of a saint, a good sense of humour, and a bladder made of cast iron.<br />
<br />
When I'm playing one of my other characters and someone else is clericing, I tend to judge how good they are by how and when they root, how and when they stun, and how and when they nuke.<br />
<br />
Clerics who can use root, stun and nuke to manage aggro effectively, prevent critter gating and running, and act as ghetto crowd controllers always attract my approval.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think what makes a good cleric depends a lot on the situation you're in.  A good cleric in a grouping situation is one that can:<br />
1. Manage thier mana (and be able to do so without brain buffs).  I have found that by doing this on a regular basis in grouping situations you learn quickly to be very efficient, and are much better prepared for that suprise mob that dispells you.<br />
2. When mana permits and everyone is healed, clerics have quite an array of nukes, stuns, roots, and other utility spells at thier disposal.  Rather than sitting and waiting, use the mana for something useful when you have time to med it back.<br />
3. Learn your buffs, know which to use on who and when to use them.  You do not want everyone in your group to need a full set of buffs at the same time.  That will quickly put you oom and cost time.<br />
In raiding situations:<br />
1. Communication, hotkeys and channels are all a part of this.  Communicate with others and be very attentive.<br />
2. Mana efficiency is less of a concern when raiding, in my opinion.  Your main focus is to keep the tank(s) alive.  There should be support, such as rods and mana dumps if needed.  This is not to say CH every time the spell refreshes, but you shouldn't be as concerned about it.<br />
3. Pay attention to where you are and what you're fighting.  ALWAYS keep your tank in heal range, yet stay out of AE range.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The best bit I can add is DONT PANIC if an add mob is beating on you. Let the group know, dont accidently drag it over a wizzy and have the shaman's root hit just as you get there. You have decent AC and HP. Try to get a root off, or let someone get agro off you. If that doesnt work. DA/DB. That gives the group another 18 seconds to deal with the mob while it is wasting it's time beating on you.</td>
