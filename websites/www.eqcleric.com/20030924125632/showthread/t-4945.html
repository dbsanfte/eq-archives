<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I saw the favorite zone thread, and had nothing to contribute BUT... my least favorite was easy to think of :<br />
<br />
Estate of Unrest<br />
<br />
Reason why is that at lvl 20 (or so) everyone in the serverwide.cleric:cleric channel (plug, hehe), everyone told me that was just THE best place to go for a DE Cleric to solo. So, I trapsed by the guards in ButchBlock along with a kitty BeastLord friend and we went to try a duo there. Everyone told me I could solo there if I was careful, so with an uber partner like a BL, I could do no wrong, right? <b>WRONG</b> We had horrible trains and I kept forgetting to bind nearby so I had to run back from PoK every 30 mins or so :(. Later, I tried this zone with my bf (DE Cleric) and my DE SK. Again, it was rough.<br />
<br />
Once I had 3 peeps in group (Cleric, BL and my SK) all was much better. The trains were more controllable and I even managed to ding a lvl before we decided to get the hell outta there /sigh  Once the cleric left, I wasn't about to sacrafice my SK too! Hehe /smilewink</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">With the new pathing, Unrest takes quite a bit of getting use to. If you are too low level the entire zone can be on you for just stepping in the door it seems. Mobs aggro through the walls and ceilings. Literally, stepping or pulling too far into the hall on the second floor can net a massive train if the mobs are still experience giving to you. Certain camps there, such as the Magus, Hand, Knight, and Bar Room, are now impossible without high level help or several groups camping those rooms. It's quite ridiculous. It's still a good zone, it just has an obscene learning curve these days. As I said, the new pathing has made it very problematic.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73"><b>Least Favourite Zone:</b>  That's a toss-up. In terms of general gameplay, I'm not sure whether it's the Train of Valor, the Lake of Ill Manners, or the Swamp of No Point.<br />
<br />
For me personally, right now, having been in a guild which has completed all the camping in Ssraeshza Temple, left that guild, and joined another one which is about to start camping in Ssraeshza Temple, I gotta say that Ssra is the absolute pits.<br />
<br />
<b>Least Favourite Camp:</b>  Another tough call.  The truth is that my least favourite camp ever has been removed from the game (Rage in Skyfire back before he was triggered).<br />
<br />
The insignia camp in Ssra, the Comm2 camp in Ssra, the VT key shard in ME, and those stupid snow griffins around the entrance to Sleepers Tomb were all bad too.<br />
<br />
My monk's had some fun camps too.  Raster was okay until he got high enough level that all the critters went green.  After that, it was horrible.  He did three levels, solo, at Raster, and then spent at least that much time again without gaining any exp at all before Raster popped.<br />
<br />
Master Yael wasn't fun because so many people were camping him at the time, and groups were racing each other to the spawn.  The same was true of Drusilla Sathir.<br />
<br />
I camped the Angry Goblin in Droga twice, once for cleric and once for monk, back when the Regal Band of Bathezid was first implemented.  It felt like everyone on the server was camping him.<br />
<br />
But, I think that on balance, the title of worst camp I've done that still exists in EQ definitely goes to Lodizal.</td>

I had so many insta deaths there it still makes me cringe.  The same goes for PoI, as soon as some n00b wondered to close a mob would be right on top of ya.

<br />
Oh yeah, right there with ya.<br />
<br />
I hate Paludal with a passion. It was only out of desperation that I brought the baby cleric there at 22, and left as soon as he hit 24. It wasn't as bad then, since I had the shammy right behind him, and he was able to go wherever he wanted with relative impunity. Rode the Shiknar Highway for most of the time, killed the Big Giant Shroom, got out.<br />
<br />
Still, I expect to be there for several hours in the Very Near Future. What I hate most about it is also what will make it the perfect spot to set up my first Full Service Aid Station.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">hmm... I always seem to find something in a zone I like, but what comes off the top of my head first as most annoying:<br />
<ul><br />
<li><b>Unrest</b> for the ease of trains caused either by yourself/your group or other groups. I have never died in Unrest but have zoned out near death many, many times.<br />
<li><b>Dawnshroud Peaks</b> for the annoying MoBs that aggro when it's hard to see them most notably the wolves (especially when near a camp!). Also very annoying is how most groups like to setup camp right on the zonelines then complain when they're trained. Move off to the damn side!<br />
</ul><br />
<br />
I agree PC can be horrid, but what I do is filter out ooc/shout/auction channels and it can be quite enjoyable either by yourself or some companions.</td>

I've spent time with each group explaining, teaching, etc all for naught.   There is just no need for the organization that you need in other zones.   That is the most annoying to me.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Rathe Mountains - Some times a decent person can be found there.  Mostly upper level toons that are controlled by teenagers that would rather farm from greens than go pull items and money from mobs that is appropriate for their level.  There is no need to farm in this game.  I have always found that just hunting will generally get you what you need.  What these people don't understand is that there will always be another helm or staff that is "better" around the corner.  They get caught up in some strange race to have more toys than the next guy and forget that they could already do what they needed to do with the gear they already have.  Most likely they have reached the point of diminished return on their gear but that extra 2 points of DEX that they would get if they could just buy that "Staff of Whoopazz" is going to make every thing just right again.  Until they see something that someone else has that is better than what they have.  Then it is back to Rathe Mountains, killing thousands of greens to save up for an item that they should either hunt for or just forget about.<br />
<br />
If you can't hunt for it because you don't know enough toons in game to go there or don't belong to a large guild then you probably don't really need that item.  <br />
<br />
I have only hunted in that zone with 2 of my many toons, my mage and my druid.  Both were 35-40.  Both got exp.  Both had a difficult time finding things to kill because of alteast one higher level toon rooting multiple giants on the hill.  Both gave it a try for a while, disliked the agression that is flowing through the zone.  (Every one is ranting about some one that KS'd them) Both left there disgusted shortly after getting there. <br />
<br />
I am glad for the POK books now.  There is no need to run through there if you are spanning the globe.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant.  Hmmm...I think I feel better.  Do I have to pay an hourly fee for that?</td>

Dulcinea tells Random Paper tank, Sorry I hate BoT with a passion, but Naeron will happily leave a boring guild group in the Elementals if he can get a spot in a  BoT group. He's an uberer cleric than I am. <br />

Ever since I died five times in one hour in BoT (and managed to kill my friends chanter that I was using to rebuff after the first round of rezzes three times), I have only been back to kill Agnarr.</td>

Least favorite camp was, like someone said above, Ragefire in SF before he was triggered.. lol, when I finally got him it was 2am, wake up to the sound of my lvl 1 halfer watcher being attacked by a Bixie.. scroll up and see it was Rage that pummeled me dow.. omg /w all WALKERS ... there are 3 players on Everquest lmao.. oh well, we managed to get him anyway, amazingly I was the only one watching him for once. Spent.. I dunno how many wasted hours on that gimp.</td>
