Seriously, I don't think this has been discussed on the board yet, so why don't we. While I know the benefits of a horse, since I've just started using one, maybe a veteran who has been using one for awhile can share the pros and cons about horses for everyone so they can start saving their pp.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Been using one for a few months, and have figured out a few pros and cons.<br />
<br />
Pro's<br />
       * You med simply by standing still, no sit agro<br />
       * You can cast spells without getting up (good if you're lazy)<br />
       * You look cool<br />
       * Nothing cooler than a flying horse<br />
       * Nothing cooler than a flying cleric on a horse<br />
<br />
Con's<br />
       * You cannot duck or jump to instantly interupt your spells. For those times where you want to interput that CH that ended up not being needed, or if you need to interupt and cast a faster heal, you need to click off the horse and then jump. Takes too much time.<br />
       * Sow has no effect on horse movement.<br />
       * You don't stop instantly, or start going fast instantly. You slide to a stop, and need to pick up speed when you start moving.<br />
       * People will beg from you, thinking you have lots of cash.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a few more of each that I have noticed, but can't remember them right now. Hope this helped =)</td>

I'm not rich by any means, my significant other sold an earring he looted in Cazic Thule and bought the horse for me - prior to EQ, we played UO together and I always had horses in that game, and had always been kind of sad that there were none in EQ.<br />
<br />
I use him mostly for getting places, and to avoid sit agro should I be in an outdoor zone and need to mem a spell.<br />
<br />
Since the advent of the new Yaulp spells (I was really lucky on runes and got Yaulp 6 on my first Rune turn-in, and Armor of the Zealot on my second - still no hand of virtue though, darn it) I've found that using Yaulp is the best way for me to maintain my mana level while fighting.  In single groups I also enjoy meleeing - the hammers are so much fun to use, but a horse really gets in the way of melee, and of course Yaulp doesn't stack with the horse.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">yes, it has always worked. I consider a horse to be an essential piece of gear for any caster. If you turn off new models, and horse models you will never see the horse. The pros/cons with models off:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
sitting mana regen always, unless attacking or moving<br />
mem spells without technically sitting<br />
no sit agro ever(unless you click off the horse) this is a huge boon for pretty much all casting classes<br />
unless you melee always, you will have much more mana than not using a horse(even when kiting as a wizard I got a noticable increase in my mana regen simply because I have to stop running to cast, so I would get a few ticks of mana during each mob that I killed<br />
much easier to 2 box as you dont need to worry about sitting, or sit agro<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
cant use new models(most high end raiding types dont use them anyway)<br />
they do eat quite a bit<br />
bank acount is 8400pp lower(this is the minimum price, and the price of all 3 horses that I have owned)<br />
<br />
I got to a point that I was putting horses on twinks because it was worth more mana than any other item that I could get, except kei.<br />
<br />
With models off, horses really have no downside and every caster should have one before grouping in pop<br />
If you are of appropriate level to group in pop and dont know how to make 8400pp....learn<br />

If you want the horse for medding/agro control purposes only, get the cheapest one.<br />

The fact that my nag is at least as slow as Jboots and eats and drinks me out of house and home can be a problem.  Click off horse when following someone, just an excuse to get left behind if you didn't buy the fastest horse...<br />

Main advice?  Buy a horse!  Why have you waited this long? /confused  Ever since I got the horse I rarely get the crud stomped out of me for having the audacity to heal my group members.  Even Chealing numerous times in the same fight.  Did I mention, BUY A HORSE? :D</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'm 26, and for the first time in my life, i had more than 200 pp! i even had to swindle more than 100pp from my friend for spells at 24. Most of it i go in High Keep, good loot (4pp splits) and great exp, and about 20 from Loio, great loot crappy exp at my levle. <br />
  So anyways, i was wondering where in hell you guys could find almost 9k for a horse?? i mean dont spells at 50-60 cost like 100pp each? Is there some 50+ hidden kunark/luclin/plane dedicated for making money? Or is this some kind of a sick joke you guys are playing on us?</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">At higher levels there are places you can go where gems worth anywhere from 10-100pp regularly drop, pp flows into your pocket, and "crap" item drops can still be sold for at least 100-200pp (thinking seb primarily here). That doesn't even touch camps within zones where items worth in the thousands or (dare I say) tens of thousands of pp drop (albeit, rare). Trust me, when I was low level, I had your same feelings (as most peeps probably do) but the pp comes.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Oh, and some spells at upper levels are drop only spells. This means that the only was to get one is to loot it off a kill or buy it. Some of these spells sell for 10,000pp or more. I have seen necro spells selling in bazaar for 60,000pp.  <br />
<br />
     This being my first toon, I had no twinkage growing up. I yearned after many items of ubber loot.  At lvl 22, I decided I needed to make enough pp to buy myself a new weapon.  I worked my way across Kunark (before PoP) to Kurns Tower. I had heard there were free flowing bone chips there, and all you had to do was scoop them off the floor. I spent 5 hours killing every skelly I saw. <br />
     When I left, I had 4 backpacks full of bonechips. That's 32 stacks of bonechips.  I Gated across Norath back to EC, which was the pre Bazaar zone for selling stuff, and auctioned bonechips for sale. One Ubber necro bought every last chip from me, then asked if I had more.  With 300pp in my pocket and a Cloak of the Rygorr Oracle as payment, I felt rich.  I started shopping and bought myself a Centi Warhammer.  <br />
     I carried that Centi until 1 exp bub into level 48, and still cringed when I paid 500pp for a new Dark Ember to replace it.</td>

At level 52, it is sometimes tough to get a group in the planes... well, not exactly tough, but you do have to wait longer than say in DL or KC... def. worth it tho! When you hit 50 go to the Planes!!<br />
<br />
The horsie, combined with my Greaves of Forbidden Rights (12 sec group heal Word of Healing effect) is SUCH an incredible combo!!<br />
<br />
In most of the low tier planes, I chain heal with the greaves, and toss in a Celesial Healing, and (rarely) a Complete Heal...  leaving me RARELY below 80% mana.  With the right tank, I'm never below 90% except to buff everyone!!  This is all due to the Horsie!  And this is WITHOUT KEI!</td>

Lvl 60.  If you look at most of the pop zones, they are all outside.  You will find LOTS of your raiding at 60+ to be considered "outdoors".  PoP Zones, ME, UP,... the list goes on which is one of the big reasons for my getting the horse.  Remember they cannot be summoned in dungeons, Seb, HS, or may other places that you cannot SoW.<br />
<br />
If find I miss my horse sooo much when I can't use it.  Aggro from healing and having to sometimes wait for "taunting" or DPS to allow me to sit on my rump.  Also there have been times where I was say buffing, and had to throw a heal and for some dumb reason I didn't have Root up.. or there is a bad train, I couldn't sit and change spells without burning a DA, again horse saved my party, click summon, grab root FAST, and go doing chanter work with root.<br />
<br />
now .. about that money....<br />
I wish BD / BS / Diamond prices didn't fall through the floor, man that was nice before PoP.  Anyhow, even still, on my server, many camps such as Velks Frenzy / TS and Village are GRAVY camps, not NBG only.  One day I was there and got SCHW, two spider fur items and BP from Villa (?? Barbed Ring Mail ??  can't remember)...  Anyhow, sold them for 4,500 .. 300 .. 300 .. 3333 plat .  In one day made 8,433 .. in Velks alone!!  Granted it was a good day, but hell, I didn't hear Cha Ching!, I heard the rumbling of 4 Hooves !<br />
<br />
Yes money is very hard to obtain low lvl, but you will get your breaks.  Another thing I did was had an old white dragon hide cloak from Vox that I won way back.  Decided to do the quest, spent 3 days in Crushbone killing greens and turning in pads/belts so I could do a turn in (with wolf form) and 2 crafted jewlery turn ins.  (it's funny when people see a dark elf in kaladim/kelethin/felwithe)  Well it got me a cloak that I turned around and sold for 60K!.  Needless to say it was gone in a week.<br />
<br />
Just hang in there, and conserve your money.  Instead of spending 2K on an item that will only boost your status up slightly and leave you with an item that you can only sell for 100 plat, save up and get yourself something nice, before you know it ou will be saying WoW I have 4K... 5K... and so on... eventually it will burn a hole in your wallet though :)</td>

Not all PoP zones are outdoors. The Tier 1 zones are. PoS and PoV are. BoT and PoNb. After that you start to hit stuff that isn't. Crypt of Decay. Torment. Tactics. Gotta break out Yaulp in those zones.</td>
