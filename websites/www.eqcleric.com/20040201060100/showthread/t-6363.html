Two days ago I deleted every EverQuest file from my computer (except my hotbutton ini, just in case).  It was a sudden and drastic move, but I am assuming it was best.  My girlfriend hated that I played, she thought that I liked the game more then her.  My family was dissapointed that I played too much.  Maybe it's an extended break, maybe I will be done for good, I don't know.  For now I'm taking it a month at a time.  Guess I will see how it goes.  I'm bored all day though lol.

I used to play EQ like three hours a day until I started dating a friend of mine last year (which is a HUGE mistake by the way). Then I logged in, played for an hour and logged out. No big deal, just spending some 'me' time that all relationships, minor or major need. <br />
<br />
If it's at the point where your family are pretty annoyed then it's safe to say that you should put your EQ boxes on the top shelf and forget about them for a while, because sometimes we all forget the true value of life outside four brick walls.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Very difficult to change patterns of behavior but it can be done.  EQ was not created for the casual log on for an hour in the evening type of play that would be considered reasonable to the outside world.  It is a huge time sink type of game.  Playing "too much" is easy to do!<br />
<br />
I believe that once you have backed off from the game and you replace your computer time with what you used to do before EQ (organize photo files, surf internet, post to message boards. etc. or whatever it is.) you will find the craving subsiding I think.<br />
<br />
I know I absolutely love the game and have changed how I play like night and day!  I have been leveling up another cleric (Triksie is level 63 now) but only doing about 10 hours a week on her.  I am tradeskilling another character...so can log on for 30 minutes and still enjoy the game.  Granted I do miss out on our guild raids a lot more now, but face it 8 hour days playing EQ are hmmmmm.  Well whatever.<br />
<br />
I am reading a lot more now.  I am spending more time on other hobbies (drawing, web sites, etc.)  While family is not an issue to me (girlfriend plays EQ too) I am finding that we are doing things at times when I used to play EQ (like going to the library to study instead of doing it in front of an EQ screen!)<br />
<br />
We have all played games we no longer play...just consider EQ another one!</td>

I will admit...I was once one of THOSE GF's that got upset/jealous (whatever you want to call it) when he used to play.  I pouted and stuff, but then one day he dared me to try it and since then, well you know it's been fun playing together.  <br />
I too will admit that for a little while there, EQ consumed us and one day we realized it just wasn't healthy.  It's just like anyother hobby though, I am sure it can turn into an addiction if you let it.  But there is life outside of EQ, you just need to make sure you see that too.  <br />

good luck, it's a fine line.<br />

<br />
We quit playing for two years after I moved out here. There were just too many things we wanted to do together.  A friend of mine got me to play again and that ended up pulling my boyfriend in again too.  We find that the more we play, the more we want to play.  If we take a break for any reason, we lose interest.  Just took a break for the holidays and it's been kinda tough regaining interest. <br />
<br />
Give it two weeks (with no hanging out on boards reading about it) and you won't miss it.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I use to spend way too much time playing EQ.  My wife was possibly at the point of leaving me, possibly.  Anyways, she was pissed.  I use to play the old TSR D&D computer games, then Elder Scrolls: Arena (still one of the best games to ever come out IMO).  Then EQ came along for me.  <br />
I could spend 8 hrs playing the game when I wasnt in class or working.  It wasnt a healthy way to live.<br />
<br />
Now I still play, and spend a decent amount of time playing (about 10 hours a week), but its just not that fun anymore.  Its a timesink that is enjoyable to a point.  But really its not the same for me as it use to be.  Not an obsession.  <br />
<br />
I tend to quit whatever game I am playing at the time for a month or two, then come back for a while.(EQ>DAOC>SB>DAOC>Horizons>DAOC>EQ).  Every time I find that I enjoy the games less and less.  They just arent that engrossing anymore.  <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well had a nice break.  I must say I've been wanting to play lol.  I didn't actually play that much.  I still goto college and made a 3.76 gpa :)  Plus I see my girlfriend.  Oh well I will figure somthing out.  I should be playing again soon.  It was a nice break and got my priorities a bit more sorted out i think.<br />
Oh and EQ2 is a definite for me!  I got Lords of EQ just for EQ2 beta and me and my 2 other real life friends who also play eq have already agreed on a basic class structure.  I'm playing the cleric type(templer or th other havnt decided) one will play a tank and the other a crowd control/slower class.  So its gonna be rocking.  We didnt do very good on class structure starting in EQ.  Not much a Monk/Mage/Necro can do by themselves lol!</td>

But I do get bad wife faction sometimes for missing out on family activities because of my EverCrack habit.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I just started playing EQ again myself. I stoped in September when I started graduate school because a full time job, full time boyfriend, and almost full time school (9 credits) was a little overwhelming. I had to get my priorities straight. That is hard to do sometimes. I managed to pull a 4.0 this semester, but I missed EQ alot, so I figured I would start up again and see how the first little bit of this semester goes. <br />
<br />
It was kind of depressing for me to have to quit because the past 4 years when I was an undergrad (double major), I had two jobs, and my boyfriend, but i was able to maintain my GPA and graduate with honors. During that phase of my life I was playing EQ till like 3 or 4 am almost every night. I know it was not healthy, but it was an addiction... and I needed my fix.... I guess a real full time job and the demands of grad school were to much for me to try to squeeze in EQ. I quit my 52 necro, but I could not force myself to delete or sell the character, and I am glad I held onto her because even though I have the cleric, I still find time to play my necro.<br />
<br />
As for the social aspects of RL, I have been trying to get my boyfriend into EQ for awhile. I am in Yoshy's boat, his computer sucks so he can not really run EQ. As for my parents on my case, I just told them "If the worse thing that I do in your eyes is play a computer game, then you should count yourselves lucky because I could be a lot of worse things." They still argue with me sometimes about it, but now I tell them that I am 22 years old, I have a job and I go to school, if this is how I choose to relax then so be it.  <br />
<br />
I know that I spend too much time on EQ, but my boyfriend thinks it is interesting, unless he is mad that I am on Eq... then its "that stupid game" but real life is more important than EQ, even though sometimes people blur those lines. Keep your priorities in order, and you can enjoy EQ and all your real life has to offer you.<br />
