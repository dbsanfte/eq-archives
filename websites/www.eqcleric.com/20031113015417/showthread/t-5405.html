   Im currently lvl 53 and very close to being 54. So ive got some questions about fightin in PoV and other tier 2 PoP zones. As of right now i mostly group for exp in PoI and PoN, and like fighting there. I was wondering what kind of Dmg output should i expect in 55+ zones how soon i should start CH and any other advice you feel i should know. Also how well would i get groups? So far in PoN and PoI i get group pretty much right after going LFg. Can i expect this in PoV or is it hard to find a group sometimes.</td>

It took me several party member's deaths one night to get used to the tier two zones ... fortunately they were VERY helpful and understanding and encouraging ... they needed me for sure as there were no other available clerics and we played very late into the night. The big thing to do really is to be much more attentive to their health bars and watch the fight, make sure you call adds and are ready to get out, a dead cleric is of no use to anyone and losing your KEI in those zones when you are under leveled is death to you and will set you back a half hour to an hour.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">One of the most noticable things I have observed when healing in PoV is the MT's equipment. A well equipped MT vs a poorly equipped MT sticks out like a sore thumb there. I've had a lvl 65 SK that could not live longer then a ten second CH cast and I've had a 61 Pally that I could start a CH at when he was at 45% and it would land when he was between 35-40%. Both had close to 6K HP buffed with Virtue, and both claimed to have high enough AC. The problem - Agility. The SK had very poor Agility stat and he took some very hard hits as a result. After he died on the first two pulls, we adjusted and I would celestial him on incoming and follow it with CH while the shammie through a fast heal at him while the chanter was slowing. It did, however get old casting 4-5 CHes every fight and the group didn't last very long.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Don't go to PoV at level 55 unless you're very, very sure of your tank.<br />
<br />
Personally, I was level 60 when PoP came out and I dinged 61 with the first kill (in Plane of Innovation, it was).  I was level 62 before I even got access to the Plane of Valor, and during the time I was levelling there, everyone in the zone was level 62-65 and originated from one of the big raid guilds.<br />
<br />
The thing about PoV is that several camps (particularly the caves camp and the golem camps) offer exp that's as good as BoT or HoH.  So you do still see level 65 tanks in elemental gear with 200+ AA there; get a tank like that and the exp will just flow.  You can start a CH on a tank like that at under 30% and still be early.<br />
<br />
However, nowadays any level 55 tank, who's wearing gear they bought in the bazaar yesterday for 20k, can zone into PoV and try to tank critters that hit for 500+ and proc nukes.  You can start a CH on a tank like that at over 70% and they'll still go SPLAT like a froglok in the Troll SK guild in Neriak.<br />
<br />
I recently went back to PoV for a couple of evenings, and encountered this new breed of tank who's decided that now they're 55, they won't settle for less than Tier 2 exp.  With Divine Arbitration, Cele Regen, Supernal Elixir and Supernal Light I could keep everyone standing, although I did get smacked about a bit by the golems.  But it took all my skill to keep a 55-ish group standing at the Western Wall.<br />
<br />
My advice is: honestly, don't be in too much of a hurry to rush to PoV if you can't find a big tank.  You'll get more exp fighting in Nightmare, Disease, or even Justice than you will while you're waiting for the corpses to repop in Valor.</td>

The major adjustment that has to be made is the type of healing that you do.  Complete Heals take too much time sometimes.  Having the mana to use the other heals will be your mana pool by way of equipment.  I know the cleric I am playing now is lvl 58 and she has the worst equipment and it really shows so far.  When I play her I am always right on the edge of oom and lom to keep up with pull rate people expect.  Also the level is important becuase of the spells that become available to us.  The heals we get keep us able to heal, and the buffs are necessarry to add the hp's and ac that are needed on our tanks.</td>

It works, but I have to agree that the 58 and 59 heals will help immensely, as well as a larger mana pool. Also, I know the group suffered from my lower buffs...I replaced a 65 cleric (big difference between Valor and Temperance, eh? LOL).<br />
<br />
So, I've been sticking to Tier 1 for now, but the xp is really slow at 57...thinking about trying Tier 2 again, hmm....decisions decisions...</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">It is better to wait until closer to 60 to regularly play in tier 2 planes. While my first experiences in these zones were at level 56 and it's not a problem as long as you have time to heal, a beefy fast cast heal will help if needed (can't wait for sup remedy). Meanwhile you'll have to rely on Divine Light and Celestial Healing as backups.<br />
<br />
This is the same as when someone hit 46 they'd say to the group "well I'm off to get some of that uber PoP xp!". It really breaks down to who you are grouped with.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile I'm finding PoI and PoD CY to be some nice spots and I do enjoy the atmosphere in PoI which makes it more attractive to play in. As for PoN, I always seem to have a bad experience in there which has turned me off of it:(.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">wow guys thx for the responses. Ive asked around from group members what its like there, and well since they are not clerics they couldnt give me proper advice. From what it sounds like im going to stick with lower zones until about 60. That is unless the exp starts going real slow, but i dont think it will get to bad. Yah i can definatlly tell the diffrence in tanks now. I was grouped witha lvl 65 war with 8K+ hp in PoI for a little while. Who knows why he was there, but it made my life very easy. Then on another day fighting the same mobs, was with a 55 Sk and well lets just say the diffrence was light and dark. Thx much for all the good advice.</td>

Hehe, how things change.  I levelled to 60 in Sebilis; at the time, there really wasn't anywhere else to do it.  And we thought the exp was really good there...<br />
<br />
I was just past 90 days /played when I dinged 60, if memory serves me correctly.<br />

The game's much faster nowadays, and compared to the options available to a cleric now, yes, Tier 1 planes are "really slow" at 57.  But that remark did make me think, because I was level 57 for over six weeks, and I spent a lot of that time camping for Plane of Hate armour... you could tell an uber cleric in those days because of her purple plate, her sarnak battle shield, and (if she was REALLY cool) her epic.<br />
<br />
There's a cleric on my server who dinged level 65 and got her epic in just over 2 days /played.  How things change...</td>
