Patch Message from the Test Server. Keep in mind it may or may not go live:<br />
<br />
May 27th, 2003<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Grouping **<br />
<br />
We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in all of EverQuest. At its core, the idea is to positively reinforce grouping. There should never be any penalty to adding "that sixth person over there," whatever class they may be, into your group. That is exactly the type of behavior that should be rewarded.<br />
<br />
In a massively multi-player game, any mechanic that penalizes those who group is one that we need to take a serious look at. While there are definite benefits to forming "well balanced" groups in terms of damage, tanking, healing, and support, there shouldn't be an active penalty to those who cannot find groups of "optimal" balance.<br />
<br />
As it stands in EverQuest, groups gain a 2% to 20% experience bonus, which we refer to as the "group bonus", for having two to six members. In practice, however, this has never been much of a bonus, even in the case of a full group, given that the experience was already being divided six ways.<br />
<br />
In the past, we had also attempted to reward people for adventuring in the more challenging Planes of Power zones by making those zones give a better rate of experience.<br />
<br />
As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% "group bonus" experience for having two to five members. <br />
<br />
Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus. Their experience is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% "group bonus." For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger pie.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be decreased slightly. However, as long as person is grouped with at least one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
We realize that we are, essentially, "manufacturing" a new type of experience after a kill. As players, we also understand it is the people who spend time in full groups who have to deal with the most interruptions and setup time caused by organizing the extra people. It simply makes sense to reward that extra time, especially if it means bringing more people together. After all, that's the whole point.<br><br>We look forward to seeing how these changes play out on Test Server.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **<br />
<br />
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a person experience after they reach level 60. The "blue to 65" range has been increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45. The best benefits, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. <br />
<br />
The world of EverQuest, at this point in its history, is truly immense and full of the best and most interesting content and visuals out there. Ideally, when a person logs on they should have a wide array of places in which to adventure. The addition of new content shouldn't entirely obsolete what already exists. Hopefully these changes will once again make that the case.</td>

<br />
This was the topic of much discussion last night in cross-server chat. I like the change, overall, because for classes that "need" to group for exp will finally see better benefits.<br />
<br />
I also think they are "better late than never" on the exp change for PoP zones. While PoP zones should have high exp for the types of mobs you have to deal with, some zones just have a ZEM that's off the charts. (i.e. some mobs in PoFire will give a 3 person group 6 percent a kill per person)<br />
<br />
If it does go live, it'll be nice, for sure.</td>

<br />
The only thing I don't get is this portion of the message:<br />
<br />
As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% "group bonus" experience for having two to five members. <br />
<br />
Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus. Their experience is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% "group bonus." For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger piece of a larger pie.<br />
<br />
So, if I am reading this right, there is no difference in the amount of exp each player gets in a 5 person group as compared to a 6 person group. Now if I think about it, it would give the advantage of having 6 rather than only 5 since it wouldn't hurt anyones exp.<br />
<br />
I know from reading other messageboards, that this is a big issue that alot of people have recommended for sometime.<br />
<br />
I think this will encourage more people to group, which means for us the clerics more groups to choose from.</td>

<br />
This will be wonderful I think if it goes live. I always duo with a paladin and not only will we always be getting a 20% bonus for just not soloing, but also we won't have to regret picking up a 3rd member like we did the other night, or a 4th and so on. Most of the really fun places to hunt seem to require a large group if you are to hunt appropriate level mobs (meaning white and higher) but for so long it's been far more worth it to just solo or duo easier targets. Okay, I'm done stating the obvious now :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Maybe not so obvious to a lot of people Bonra!<br />
<br />
I got to thinking about my usual haunts as of late (where my 55 warrior/55 cleric hunt as a duo) and kind of take it as now we will get 20% instead of 2% experience bonus right off the bat.  We will will still split the experience that whatever we are killing gives us two ways.  We add the third person gives us 10% (group now gets 30% experience bonus to split) more exp to the group that we split 3 ways.  Is this bonus enough to offset what we would have received as a duo?  Not sure will have to check around for some formulas.<br />
<br />
You can kind of see what I am getting at here, as it has been addressed many times before.<br />
Example:  You have 10 units of experience a mob gives, a 2 person group split it each get 5 units...but there is a 20% bonus so each group member gets 6 units of exp.  With a 3 person group each group member gets 3.3 units for the base experience but there is a 30% bonus so each group member gets 4.33 units of experience from that mob.<br />
<br />
You really can't top the solo experience period!  Experience return goes down percentage wise the more you have in your group no matter what.  This change just sort of works on adding that 6th member the way I see it.  What about those zones with 18 people in them and everyone is soloing or duoing or 2 boxing etc.  I think they still need to fine tune the groupage stuff.  You should gain the most experience the more people you are grouped with per time involved per kill (more group members means faster kills versus 20 minutes solo kill etc.)</td>

You note that "Experience return goes down percentage wise the more you have in your group no matter what". This is true for the "per/kill" experience. But the "experience per hour" should increase as you add more members to the group, as long as the pull rate is increased to keep up with the kill rate. As we all know, kills are faster with more people in the group, so if the pulls also increase, the xp per hour goes up.<br />
<br />
I think that the people who prefer soloing experience do so because perhaps groups they have been in do not increase their pull rate, and thus the xp/hour is worse than solo xp/hour.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I look forward to this group xp increase....it appears that a 5 or six person group now will gain around 70% xp bonus per kill...therefore the xp will almost be double what is it right now (assuming the current 5 or 6 person group bonus is around 10% I believe).</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, some classes don't "prefer" to solo, rather, groups simply won't invite them.<br />
<br />
Ask SK's, Necro's especially, and they'll tell you, that for most of them, soloing became a way of life because there was no real "need" for them in a group.<br />
<br />
**note** Those classes fit well in groups, but it's more of a general attitude that those classes have put up with, since back in the early days. **<br />

I don't see the exp bonus as a "nerf" to soloer's though. Yes, the ZEM's for the PoP zones changing, will be a nerf to anyone that prefers to solo. Admittedly though, those changes needed to be made, and alot sooner than now. It's seriously sick how much solo exp you can get in certain PoP zones.<br />
<br />
Most soloer's expected this to happen eventually (I know I did), so it's not coming as a shock. Most of the soloer's in PoP zones, that have been sucking up the sweet exp for awhile are virtually done exp-hunting anyway. True, it is a knee-jerk reaction on Sony's part, but it's not as terrible as some people would think, imo.</td>

I think the most important part of this though is that it makes it hopefully worthwhile for 65s to kill below tier 2. As it is, people in PoD know better than to even ask me to join them, even though right now I don't have some guild affiliation that says "look I'm elemental flagged." (which I'm not)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Some notes of observation based on my limited experience (as a long-teim Test server player):<br />
<br />
Before and after the patch that introduced this change, I was in a group in the Halls of Honour basement.  We were fighting Valorian Guardians (level 62) and Valorian Sentries (level 63) (and some other things like animated armour and Vallorian Guards, neither of which can I remember the con level).  Before the patch, at level 62, it would take about 3 level 62 Vallorian Guardians for each percent of regular experience gained (at 100% going to regular experience).  I camped for the patch at 62.97.  When I returned, it took 5 kills to get that 3%, one of which was a Sentry, 2 were Guardians, 1 was a Guardian of Marr (unknown level) and one other kill that I got experience for right after logging back in.<br />
<br />
So instead of taking the expected 9+ kills to make that 3%, it took 5.  We had a full group most of this time, so I don't know how it effected things.  Once I made 63, I made another 10% in the next two hours (it took 4 kills for the first 1% into 63).  (I don't know how that compares experience gain in HonorA in a full or almost full group before the XP changes, though.)  The Necro in the group wasn't happy with the changes, however, because he said he could make twice as much experience solo.  Clerics, however, can't solo in PoP, so grouping is the only choice I have.<br />
<br />
So, take this for what it's worth.  I'll have to do more "research" into the changes to make a better judgement.  Right now I'm on the fence.</td>

I am honestly very much looking forward to this change (should they implement it).  I love groups, I love <b>full</b> groups to be more specific.  It bothers me when I join with one or two other people and I see someone shouting LFG for hours, and the the group doesn't want to take that person cause they'll "slow down xp".<br />
<br />
Usually I end up leaving the group and logging another character, or bothering until they let the person in. :)<br />

I know, I'm horrible, but it frustrates me! /sigh <br />

Explorer that I am, I'm often soloing with one character or another because it's impossible to make a group that will go to places other than the overcrowded exp farms (and all twinks now, you can't even entice them with phat lewt!). I keep my group skills up, but on even my monk I end up soloing a lot because I can't stand to exp in OT and Dreadlands. /rant on BRING PEOPLE BACK TO GUK!! /rant off<br />

ITS GREAT. <br />
<br />
<br />
It's an incredible boon to grouping. It's becoming more and more rare to have people ignored just because 'we're already making good xp'. Now when you let someone join the group instead of seeing a decrease in the experience you were making you've got a little bit of an increase, and of course you can usually kill things faster. It's really been great. <br />
<br />
I do hope they send this out to live... the experience on test has been interesting but we are such a small community that I'd love to hear how it works on a much more populated server. <br />

It's not really a nerf to solo exp. Well it is but only in the PoP. The reason it is being called a nerf is because they're lowering the ZEM on PoP zones. It's being balanced by the new group bonus; so it's not going to hurt groups. So this chance in no nerfs sub 50 soloing.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">It may not be a nerf to solo experience.  What I posted was based on just the first pass of the experience changes.  Since then, they have patched again with the following experience changes:<br />

<br />
In the test server update that occurred earlier today (server downtime), and in the PoP Zones Update that just occurred (PoP zones downtime), there were a number of tuning changes made to the new experience system and the PoP zones themselves.<br />
<br />
The effect of these changes should more closely match the intent that was described in the original message.  The first round of changes, by the numbers, didn't.<br />
<br />
It went the right direction in all cases, and a number of the group size vs target type combinations were covered well.  However, there were a number of cases where the target was overshot.<br />
<br />
Among these:<br />
<br />
- Not generous enough vs PoP NPCs for groups of all sizes, the smaller groups and soloists being the hardest hit.<br />
<br />
- Too generous with 4-6 man groups vs Non-PoP NPCs who can, in some cases, barely hurt their attackers.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're interested in helping test these most recent changes, here is the list of combinations that we're trying to make sure all reward appropriately:<br />
<br />
Solo - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range<br />
Solo - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range<br />
Solo - PoP<br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range<br />
Small Group (2-4) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range<br />
Small Group (2-4) - PoP <br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - New Blue Exp Range<br />
Group (5-6) - Non-PoP - Old Blue Exp Range<br />
Group (5-6) - PoP <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind while testing out group experience, as always, group bonuses only apply according to the number of people who are in range.  <br />
<br />
Feel free to try out as many combinations as you can.  As before, we look forward to hearing opinions on these changes via the boards and Dev Corner.  Thanks very much for helping out!</td></tr></table><br />
So, before it goes live, there will be further tuning for both groups and solo.  I imagine that there will be even more tuning once it does go live and they have a greater number of samples from which to sample data -- there are only so many people on Test, and out of those, only a certain percentage who are PoP capable.</td>
