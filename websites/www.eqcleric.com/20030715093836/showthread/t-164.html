<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">hI, I just made a new cleric as I'm trying to figure out what class to make my main.  I have an 11 chanter, 11 BSTL, 7 mage, and 6 pally and 4 Druid.  I want to role play an Erudite but want a character that can pull with magic and melee or nuke the rest of the fight when solo.  I like being useful in a group and surprisingly I realize that I like healing (in DAOC I have a Shaman)  <br />
My question is, does the cleric fit this description?  I don't want to tank as a main.  I must pull with a spell, I hate running things down, but I don't want to be helpless if something reaches me (see mage)  My chanter couldn't melee or take hits if spells were resisted and killed too slowly.<br />

If you enjoying being the hero this si for you...If you don't liek being the goat...this isn't for you. You can pull the best heal out of your butt to save someone from dying one sec and the next second yoru the worst cleric on the game cause of someone elses mistake. Cleric is 95% mental 5% physical :) (sorry its the jock in me) You have to know every classes/races strengths and weaknesses you need to be able to multitask very well (I guess not as much anymore without the spell book..but still..) So if you like the hero and youw anna be the person witht he ball in your hands for the final shot at the buzzer this is it..The Cleric Class...Sometimes hero...Sometimes Goat...Always #1</td>

The main things you should know about clerics are: <br />
1) their life is easier than most since they're always wanted for groups and therefore have no trouble getting them<br />
2) most people are nice to them because a) they will eventually want a rez and b) a group will ditch most anyone else before they ditch their cleric<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Just because every group wants a cleric (which is not even true) does not mean that there will be a group for every cleric out there.  Sorry, but melee have it much better off when grouping.  You don't say "Sorry, I already have a melee in my group, I want something else".  There is no reason to have multiple clerics in a group, since if you want additional healing, a cleric or shaman adds much more to the group than a second cleric.<br />
<br />
As far as wanting to pull with magic, be able to melee, and heal, go for a paladin.  Clerics are not a melee class, and their skills are to help them survive long enough to get help.  Clerics were never meant to deal melee damage (Verant just pulled the hammers out of their asses because they no longer have any integrity).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, any class can melee up to a certain level, like 10-12 (or higher, depending on gear).  After that, you abandon melee.  Sure, you CAN get up and whack things if you want, but it is pretty much a waste of time, and groups tend not to appreciate it.  If you want to melee as a means of contributing to the group, then you need to pick a melee character, not a priest or caster.</td>

You may want to play your cleric up to 60 before stating fact #4 and get in a guild that will actually challenge you.  Try camping Ssra insignias when you are the only cleric supporting 10 people in a mini-raid and tell me that you _STILL_ are a boring easy class.<br />
<br />
My opinion of cleric class in general is:<br />
You are either 1 of 2 different kinds of clerics I have seen:<br />
<br />
1.  You sit and get up to Complete Heal + HP Buff and then sit again.  You bring nothing to a group but unlimitted HP and you will get no further than ending up being a Velks bot the rest of your EQ career<br />
<br />
or you are:<br />
<br />
2.  You are an active cleric who Yaulps and melees while keeping an eye on the group, you cast MOR and MOK and bash and root park and know how to add real efficiency to a group.  You strive to be challenged by pushing your limits.<br />
<br />
Which cleric you are is up to you.  I am usually #2, but it's also nice to be able to be in "cruise control mode" which are cleric type #1 :)<br />
<br />
Cleric class is fun, but it takes a certain personality indeed to play one.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In terms of getting a group, I had some difficulty in the early 30 ranges because our healing capacity wasn't fully appreciated until then. Once you get CH (39), you can now start grouping with much higher level characters, which means you might die more frequently (because of your low-level/huge aggro) but you also have the opportunity to level more quickly (because most mobs will con yellow and red to you). Don't expect to solo much, however, no matter what people say.<br />

I enjoy being able to melee. yes i cant take on major mobs forever but I do help in groups. As for people in groups not liking it, those are people who fear they will die, so as i tell them "If you ever die in a group with me cause of soemthing I did, then you can tell em how to play my character. Till then Shut up". As anyone who has grouped with me will tell you. I know my limitations. I know what i can do what i cant do and how long I can do it for. Stereotypes are my biggest pet pieves. I also believe 2 Clerics in a group are great :) especially when you don;t have a chanter you are insured no 00ming. One takes heals while the other waits for him to lose mana. Then the other takes over healing while the other meds. I personally think ist great.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Let me clarify my post.  I can only play about 2 hours at a time.  so I need a character that can either get groups quick or solo in the times when I must go it alone because I don't want to leave people in the lurch.  I don't want to be a tank, but I want to be able to tank when I need to.  That is the type of class I hope this is.  Am I wrong?  I would hate to slowly get to 20 and realize I am totally dependant on a group for killing anything.  though I know everyone needs a group at higher levels.  My problem may be unfamiliararity with EQ.  In DAOC I know where I can go and get a group with my shaman real quick without putting the group in jeopardy if I leave.  I also know where I can solo if I don't have much time.  I don't know these things about EQ.  I also have a pally that I'm trying out (lvl 8 Erudite).  He's better than I thought but I have to do more running around than I like becuase I can't pull with magic.  I also have a beastlord which seemed perfect because I could tank or cast but I have big time problems with my sound on Luclin and keep crashing.  Also, I have to wait until lvl 15 to get a good spell to pull with.  So I thought I would go back to my original paladan <br />
and also try the cleric.<br />
<br />
I got real excited when I first made my cleric because I thought the class was perfect for me.  I was soloing in the newbie area and douing for a little.  Then I went back to soloing for about 30 min.  When I had spare mana, I would heal people and buff them.(mighty lvl 3 buffs)  It was perfect!  But reading on this board and especially the other board about waiting for a group then going to the place and waiting for the pull and between pulls.  Then not being able to solo for exp really turned me off.  Clarify please!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">if you play the cleric post 50 like that one poster said (option #2), cleric is a blast!!! i think i am finaly coming into my own at lvl 55. it is so fun to get KEI then get in a well balanced group. you get to stand up and add real damage to the group, i use yalp iv and a dark ember and with str buffs i have str of 199 and then with haste and my proc from the dark ember i add serious damage, not to mention my stuns i am using every time they are available i can go 4-5 mobs get down to 70m and then med for a mob or two and get right back into it. there is no reason to just sit at the post 53-55 lvl, before that my skills sucked so bad, only because i had never used them, i am so glad that they came out with the new hammers, that made me get off my ass and raise my skills. you still have times when of course you are going to have to sit and med, bad pulls for expample, but if you are in a good group i say get in it!!! just remember to watch the groups life. i also was teamed with a 54 wiz and a 55 rogue in the hole, i was the tank!!! i would stun to get agro so the rogue could BS then when rogue re took agro he would evade and i was the tank again, it was awesome!! so much fun! then we added a ench to the mix and we tore that place up! so don't let people tell you all a cleric does is sit med, buff, heal, because those people are not playing there class, or they are not clerics. but yes, there are times that it is nice you can say..kinda afk, but got a eye on your health ( i have 6 month old son and sometimes i have to play that way). but by no means is that all a cleric can do, you got the tools, use them!!!!<br />
<br />
whew.. that was way long winded for me!!!!!<br />
<br />

55 cleric<br />
