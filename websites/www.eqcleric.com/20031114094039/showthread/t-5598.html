<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hi all, first post; love the community!<br />
<br />
I know this is strange, but I was curious if anyone else had, or has, similiar dreams as I do. Each night after playing my cleric I will go to sleep and have dreams that I am in a group and everything that can go wrong IS going wrong. For instance, I will be in the middle of a CH and people will just start dying left and right in the group. No matter who I go to heal they are dead halfway through the casting of the spell. On top of that, becuase people have died, I hold to the belief that it is my responsibility to get them rez'd. Now the problem is that once I do get them rez'd they die again. It's an endless loop of death and and mayhem, not being able to get heals off in time until I wake up. This too is a problem becuase alot of times I will go back to sleep because I can't let those dead group members go unrez'd. <br />
<br />
Now when I play for real, I do push the envelope with my tanks, but never my casters. However, death is not a frequent occurance as I pride myself on being a good cleric and nearly everyone I group with for the first time tells me that I did a fantastic job when the hunt is over for the day. Most say they were worried at first, but I expect this, as putting your life in someone else's hands that you have never played with before can be quite nerve racking. Heck, on 2 of my first 5 or so trips to PoN I took the MT to 1% health. I have to say on those occasions I was biting my nails too, hehe. I feel confident in doing it though, becuase I know how to play the class, and I have a good gut instinct about when to cast due to my career of playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Although I already know I play too much, feel free to share with everyone if you had had similiar thoughts or dreams. I welcome any support or comedic jesting.<br />
<br />
** As a second topic: As much as I love the new expansion, I hate it at the same time. I need to do things with my cleric that requires other people willing to do the oldschool stuff. I have a plate Skyshrine helmet waiting to crown my head, but I can't find hardly anyone willing to do Kael for faction work even in areas like the arena where plate and other armor can drop that they too can use. I would also love to go Fungus Grove or Howling Stones, but everyone is either POP or LDON now and it's bothersome. Like I said, I love the exp and items and dungeon crawl experience, but I also want to enjoy the rest of the game too and it's so hard when you can't get company to do it with when friends aren't online to go with you.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">No, but the night before before every major Epic step (and in the case of Gimpy and Gurgle, during), I would spend the entire frigg'n night doing it over and over again in my dreams.<br />
<br />
For Gimpy (which I started with, then banked the ring till it was needed) I must have seen that bastard pop 1,000 times and killed him each and every time. I would keep waking up and thinking I was still logged in and that he had popped. And since he was a 3 day camp for me...<br />
<br />
Gurgle wasn't quite as bad, since I really only camped him in bits and pieces one weekend before settling and and getting him twice in a row on Monday.<br />
<br />
Nothing for Plassy, since he was a spur of the moment kill after taking down RageFire for someone else. ("Hey, since we are on the subject, can someone come help me in Temple of SolRo?")<br />
<br />
Chardok? Got to dream kill the OverKing <i>twice</i> since we weren't able to get him twice the first weekend (and I was second in line). Two weekend in  a row of watching him drop over and over and over...<br />
<br />
Ixi didn't cause me any issues that I recall. He was scheduled a few days in advance, and I knew that he was going to drop easy, so my brain didn't get obsessive on it. I had already helped kill him a few times before my turn came up...and knew that we would likely have 4 groups minimum- with 6 groups being more likey- show up. To me, he was nothing but an amusing, trivial, but required step. The only variable was going to be how long we had to wait for the Turn In NPC to spawn.<br />
<br />
I knew RageFire was going to get his butt BBQ'd as well, but the turn in...yeesh, I spent my entire dream cycle sitting in SolB, watching his butt spawn over and over again...usually spawning as his Dragon form. I knew it was going to be a cakewalk to kill him, but I was highly stressed that I would miss his spawn and someone else would take him, or I would get killed and go through hell getting back down (which did happen, btw. Guild Bonding Experience. I gotta remember that we still owe the FG's a few death cycles from that little excursion)<br />
<br />
Once the turn in was done, I slept like a baby that night, and killed RageFire twice the next night to get myself and another Cleric her epic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had similar issues when Shazzog was camping the Empty Flask for his Stoicism spell (which was every bit as major a turning point to him at the time as the SuperSoaker was to Duhikae later, and equally as frustrating as camping Gimpy. The loot and XP were just better)<br />
<br />
Short of that, the only time I Dream EverQuest is when I have spent several hours playing and try to go to bed right away as soon as I log. Then, I may well find myself still going on and on. I avoid that now by simply not playing EQ right up until I want to go to sleep. I read for a while, watch TV, do something- anything- to switch my mental gears.</td>
