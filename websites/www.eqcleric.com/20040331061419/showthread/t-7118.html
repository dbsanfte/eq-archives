<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Okay, I hope I do not regret bringing this topic up but I am seeking others opinion on whether it is time to look at our incomplete Complete Heal spell.  <br />
<br />
With top geared tanks hitting 12k and even decently equipped approaching 9k hp, I find it disconcerting to not be able to fill the tank, pardon the pun.  I understand that the raid versus xp group heal may need to be addressed as two separate issues.  Yes, I do use the whole variety of spells that are available to do my job in keeping folks alive, but it seems that for clerics as a class to remain the master of healing, sooner or later the devs will need to look at CH.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are in favor of bringing CH back to a true CH how would you implement it?  An AA ability? A level 65 spell?  Would you implement a true CH for a slightly (emphasis on slightly) higher mana cost? Of course, being a cleric if it were to be upgraded I believe it should continue to be a cleric only thing.<br />
<br />
*** Edit - In light of griping about the number of clerics needed for certain encounters, feel free to also address the issue of allowing CH to be modified by spell haste or perhaps AA ability.  ***<br />
<br />
Hopefully this post does not draw too many flames but provokes an open discussion of the issue. Thanks.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well I tend to agree with this line of thinking.... even though I personally I have only once grouped with a tank that actually had enough health to make my CHeal incomplete, talk about stress at least until I found out how many HP's he had.<br />
<br />
I dont think however that an AA should be the manner of doing this...since we already have AA's to improve healing ability and all... I think it should be a revision of the spell as opposed to a new spell.<br />
<br />
Here's some of my thinking on this: Complete Heal was around when level 50 was as high as you could go am I correct? Surely in those days 7500 HPs was considered common for a tank. No doubt there were some who had even more than that. But we do not want to wait for a CHeal to hit when the tank is at 01% health, though it may happen at times when things get nasty.... that is not the norm. Nowadays I see many tanks with nearly that.... a human tank I came across once recently had 6200 HPs. And he wasnt even level 60 yet.<br />
<br />
Anyway.... if you make it a new spell, at what level do you make it attainable? If it is at 65.... then you're gonna be forced to use an insufficient heal on the tank even tho maybe he has been well over that 7500 limit for some time. And HOW do you attain it...quest? Vendor?<br />
<br />
I think the Incomplete Heal should be addressed by making it the same as most of our other heals, the maximum upper limit should increase with each level you attain begining when you first get the spell and ending at say 56 when we get our 96% Rez...at maybe 12000. Or maybe set the max for 20K but not until level 65....that would be really good.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">It maxes at 8750 with all the healing AA's. It's too bad GoD didn't add another Healing Adept AA for the Clerics that hunt with tanks in the 11-12k+ range. In exp groups I rarely see the full 7.5k hit as you can't let a tank even with 9k get down to 1.5k safely in most spots.<br />
<br />
I see this as more of an issue at the Time level of the game and also moreso if the level cap is raised.  AA's or items that help CH would probably be the best way to go as opposed to level or a spell at a certain level.<br />
<br />
Modified by spell haste is about the worst idea you could implement. It'd make CH chains very complicated to set up, if say one Cleric casted CH in 10 seconds, another in 7.4, another in 8.0, etc. That's not to say there isn't an issue with CH healing more per second than blast heals generally do. Supernal Remedy being spammed heals less per second than a CH can, Supernal Light might be about the same but it's much less efficient.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As to the more mana cost.... well the problem I have with increasing it to 600  is that if you do it to the original spell like I suggested above.... then that's an enormous amount of mana at 39,  easily almost half your mana pool for some and still takes a great deal at higher levels. And while its not so much for me now at 52, the problem is that I have on several occasions had to cast it multiple times just to finish one mob.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I would have to agree with doing it in one of two ways:<br />
<br />
1) Replace our new Spell Casting Fury AA with another Healing AA which up's the max amount CHeal can heal for, because like Genolil said (not sure if its true, but im also not saying it isnt) there is a tank on Povar coming up to 16k hp.  Well lets work it out our 7500hp heal is LESS THAN HALF his HP (46.8% to be exact).<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) Give us a new Cheal available anywhere between 63-65 since at 63 you will occasionally get a group with a 10-11k+ tank and it would be nice to have.  Make the cast time 12 seconds and have it cost 600-700 mana and you would prolly be fine since most raids would continue to use the old Cheal in chains instead of increasing chan sizes.<br />
<br />
As for spell haste like someone said that is the worst thing you could do to CHeal, however Extended Range on CHeal would be nice or maybe even mana pres on Cheal (mana pres IV or Conservation of Whatever it is)</td>

With maxed out Advanced Healing Adept, I CH for 8925 (apart from the times I critical heal for 17850).  And the truth is that I'm more than happy with this.<br />
<br />
I can CH for well over 10k with a cast time of 9 seconds, if I use Word of Redemption with certain focus effects on.  If it's ever really important to me that I heal a tank to full, I can do it.</td>

Does /TGB Work with the group CH ? This would be a way, albeit an expensive one, to CH for more. <br />
Although it doesn't seem right that we get a 10k group heal but only a 7.5k single heal (base numbers). You'd think we could heal a single target for more than an entire group.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">EQ Devs said back when they changed CH to its current level that one thing they wished was that they had NEVER given clerics a complete heal spell.  I don't think they'll ever give us one again - but remember even the initial complete heal had a cap of 10k - no one could even get over 10k hit points (falling to your death was for 10k).<br />
<br />
I'm healing tanks regularly now who have over 10k hit points and I've never found my CH, with all healing AAs and Blessing of Marr focus to be in any way inadequate.  (Could be I'll revisit the way I feel about it when I have a tank to heal with 16k :p - but I really kind of doubt it; I'll just have more of a cushion for when to cast CH.)<br />
<br />
In a CH rotation, it's rare for a heal to hit for even half its potential, absent a burp in the rot.<br />
<br />
Edit:  TGB does not work with Word of Redemption; it only works with healing spells that leave a buff icon when cast.</td>

Extended Range II or higher does work on CH.<br />

Get a moonstone ring, ceramic sword of war, or kill Babs in Fire for the Mask of Insightful and you'll get your extended range. There's many more items but these are the ones I used and upgraded to as I progressed in gear.<br />

You can outrange the AE of RZTW, Xegony, and many other mobs AE with extended range. Try these mobs without an ER item and the AE will eat you up.</td>

<b>Here's some of my thinking on this: Complete Heal was around when level 50 was as high as you could go am I correct? Surely in those days 7500 HPs was considered common for a tank. No doubt there were some who had even more than that. But we do not want to wait for a CHeal to hit when the tank is at 01% health, though it may happen at times when things get nasty.... that is not the norm. Nowadays I see many tanks with nearly that.... a human tank I came across once recently had 6200 HPs. And he wasnt even level 60 yet.<br />
</b></td></tr></table> <br />
<br />
Actually, I'd be suprised if 6k tanks were common.  There's several factors you have to consider when comparing tank hps today vs original CH.<br />
<br />
<ol type="1"><br />
<li>Max Level of 50<br />
<li>Max Stamina Of 255<br />
<li>Fewer +HP Gear<br />
<li>Fewer +STA Gear<br />
<li>Lower HP buffs (No Aego even)<br />
</ol> <br />
<br />
Reallistically, the big jump for tanks started with Kunark and has continued to grow from there.  But the original Complete Heal (10,000) was designed to be an absurd amount of Hit Points that no one would ever see.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">When the cap was 50 a tank's HP would have been nowhere near 7500. Reso+Naltron only added 775 HP, and there was nowhere near the amount of HP on common items. I'd say around 4500 buffed would have been more common, for a fairly well equipped warrior.<br />
<br />
Unless you regularly group with a Tank over 13k HP (which would be about 1% of all tanks) I can't see CH "only" healing for 8925 being a concern. On raids CH will land above 50% the vast majority of the time, due to spike damage from things like flurry, procs, and AEs.<br />
<br />
Most of these people who complain about CH not doing enough aren't near the level of play where it matters. I've had about a dozen CHs not land for full without Healing Adept, and I've casted a lot of CHs.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Nobody should have the ability to completely heal someone. The EQ developers realized this long ago. The current "Complete Healing" is as close to it as anyone is ever going to get. They would nerf it further or remove it from the game if they could now, probably, except that some encounters are designed around a solid CH chain. (AoW, anyone?)<br />
<br />
As much as it can be disheartening when I cast a CH and it doesn't top off the tank, I don't think the spell should be modified. The only thing I *might* ask for is that improved healing foci worked with it. 7500 is bane enough to encounter designers though.</td>
