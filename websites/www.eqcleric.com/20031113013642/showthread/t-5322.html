<br />
A Few Days Ago, My (then) 38 Cleric Mastered 1H Blunt! :D <br />
<br />
At the time I was camping a spawn in Mistmoore with a RL Friend. When I Told him that I had Mastered Blunt, he was less than entheusiastic (sp?).  He Told me 'well i usualy give gratz to people that master skills..... but no.'<br />
<br />
/eek <br />
<br />
Then the next day IRL, we were talking about the night before when we camped the spawn, and my Master Blunt came up. I told my friend that really, I had only mastered Blunt because I'm often in groups where I'm the backup healer and I often Battle Cleric to break the Nuke fest. And also because after I pull, i usualy stay around and wack the mob for a little.<br />
<br />
<blank face> 'OMG You Pull? /confused  Play your class dude!'<br />
<br />
/grr <br />
<br />
So is it just me, or can a Cleric go out and pull once and a while, or run in and practice his bash when the mob starts its death march? Or Was he right, and do Clerics just have to sit back behind the lines and med the whole time</td>

I have pulled, and meleed, still keeping in mind that I am main healer and doing that job as well.<br />
<br />
I have nuked, meleed and still kept my group alive.<br />
<br />
I have had to do crowd control and root park and still kept my group alive.<br />
<br />
I have had to do nothing but med and heal cause the action was fast, very fast and needed me to heal only.<br />
<br />
Each class has it advantages, and can always be played to those advantages, but there are many more things that each and every class can do and even do well.  Don't let yourself get into the mindset that your a healer only and that you have to only sit and med and pop up for a heal.  <br />
<br />
I have pulled the new zone, SolC, since I can pacify mobs and we didn't have a FD puller.  Yaulp5, procing hammer, ranger atk buffs and you know what, pretty impressive dps from a cleric, mana regen keeping up and keeping group alive to boot. <br />
<br />
You also need to know when to switch roles, go from a puller/meleer to the sit and med version to the crowd control version, ect., such as when you get adds, if no chanter, bard or necro to mez, you play root parker and do crowd control.  <br />
<br />
Play the game as you see fit, but do remember that since your a cleric, it is your primary job to keep folks alive, as long as that happens, play as you see fit.</td>

<br />
I was just in PoD last night with a group (Shammy, Enchanter, Warrior, Rogue, Druid? and meself).  Things were going greats so I waded and and went melee on there arses.   The group loved it.  The Shammy and Chanter buffed the hell out of me (I already had KEI and Virtue) and I was wading through them.  Anytime I did have to stop and heal it was a quick function key for person needing heal then hot key then /assist hotkey and back to crushing and bashing.  Remember PoD is no joke I've had some horrible times in there, but I was adding great DPS and the mobs fell quick and I dinged 53.<br />
<br />
I was always meleeing until 33...then someone complained so I stopped.  And my skills started getting soo far behind it was driving me nuts.  From 33 to about 45 I did the sit and heal thing.  It drove me nuts...it's so incredibly boring.   So I decided then that from now on if I had the mana I was meleein.  At first I asked but now I just do it...if someone complains then they can find a sit and med Cleric. <br />
<br />
This is a huge debate over all "Should we sit and med all the time or can we get in the action while healing (which is what a Cleric is truly supposed to do...would we have yaulp if we weren't?)."  I personally got into an argument with a RL friend about this...he felt I should always sit and med no matter what "just in case."  Of course he had only ever played a paladin and never touched a caster class at all.  I can say that the answer is "Depends."  If mana is good and group is cruising...get in there and rough some beasties up.  The mobs will fall quicker and thusly the xp will flow faster.  So don't be afraid to get in there in that case.  But if you are taxing your mana or are in a notoriously high add area (KC for example)  or an area where your tank is getting pounded on I'd say sit and med...eventually the world is going to crash in and your going to have to bail out that fool puller.<br />
<br />
Guess what I am saying is don't listen to people who say you should sit and med all the time.  They have obviously never played a Cleric and realized how much of a waste of time it can be (especially when you are fm all the time).</td>

Ask the people I group with...the Cleric pulling <i>is</i> playing his class.<br />
Like Braeaelin, I do it mostly in Dulak for right now...well, and the week I spent in SkyFire, I pulled off and on if I had a group. (If KEI was going strong, I pulled. If it was toast, I sat and medded between pulls)<br />
<br />
Pacify makes us great pullers in some zones\situations. Sure, a monk or SK can FD to split mobs...but with Pacify, why bother? (obviously, this won't work in all zones...but it sure will in Dulak)<br />
<br />
We may be the primary healer, but that doesn't mean we have to do nothing <i>but</i> heal (unless the mobs are just that nasty or you are in a place where the pullers can keep you that busy).<br />
<br />
We pull, we tank, we nuke, we root park and atone, all while keeping our wards healed up and happy...we are the Amazing Wonder Clerics!<br />

get off yer arse anytime you can!!!<br />

your going to want that 1hb when you hit 56 and get your hammer. i haven't played the sit and med cleric since lvl 56. as long as you don't have a problem with getting carried away and forgetting to heal there is nothing wrong with you mlee as long as you have the mana. only time i have to sit and med is after a bad pull (someone else doing bad job) or if the tank sux (someone elses fault again). it is a crappy exp group that i can't melee in, and i leave those groups ASAP, it is not fun for me to just sit.<br />
<br />
clerics have many skills, use them all!! we can melee, tank if needed, pull, CC, stun AND!!!!! keep the group alive!!!<br />

Was your friend playing a Ranger? Tell him to to 'go play his class' by dying at the feet of a green con... </b></td></tr></table> <br />
<br />
Lmao! :D    Yes the RL friend is a Ranger and was a Dr00d untill an arguement with another RL buddy made him quit for 3 months.  /rolleyes <br />
<br />
Phixin you couldn't be more right. Who is he to tell me what to do in a group? I never tell him that 'Rangers can't melee! They <b> have </b> stand back and arch past 45'<br />
<br />
And yeah guys, i do all of that stuff. When i Hit FM and the group is doin some arse kickin power, i will always ask if i can pull and then i just stand there and melee untill i need to fall back and hit my heal hot buttons. <br />
<br />
I CONSTANTLY bother my group with my '/g Stunning %t with the vengefull Hand of Brell!' and '/g Casting WRATH on %t! DIE you FOOL!' hot buttons<br />
<br />
Just today infact, i was called upon to do a rezz in KC while i was grouping in DL. So i ran into KC and rezzed the person, with no donation mind you ;( , then came back to the Group and noticed i Had two mobs on my tail. So i stunned, rooted, ran, stun rooted, memed Atone and just memblured them. UNfortunatly i picked up two more and had wear out my '/g Ghetto Mezzing %t' hot button.<br />
<br />
And Garm I completly agree about the Yalup Line. I have always pictured a Cleric as a Holy Knight who gets his plate mail and his shield nice and dented up there with the best of the Paladins and who also has the Healing Powers similar to a Lay of Hands. <br />
<br />
<off topic> If you look at it, Clerics and Paladins are two different views of the Same Crusade age idea, The Knights Templar. These were holy knights who carried the cross with them into battle and had the ability to use a Lay of their Hands to heal injured comrads. <br />
<br />
If you squint a little, the Cleric and the Paladin both fit this description.<br />

Yep. I should note that I have <i>never</i> had anyone I group with tell me to 'play my class' by not meleeing. For one, they learn the power of the Berzerkergang Cleric very fast, and for another...they would not be in future groups.<br />
<br />
Ah heck, I suppose if I liked them, I may give them one chance to repent after I have pulled\tanked\healed for an hour or so. If they still insisted I shouldn't melee, Buh BYE! I'm sure they can find a group with a lethargic cleric that sits and meds all the time if they look hard enough. Try not to train us on your way out, thx!</td>
