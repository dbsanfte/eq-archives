You'll notice that I am not on one of the 'Zeks, so "group pvp" isn't an option. My position in Firiona Vie requires that I duel pretty much whenever I'm challenged, and when I rerolled as a cleric, I had my doubts whether I could put up a decent fight or a fight at all.  I just wondered if the community would share some tatics, maybe a couple key items that give you the edge...any help would be appreciated.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">For tactics, the hackneyed response is to say use Flash of Light. Only concrete thing I can really give you is to dispel your opponent as much as possible, and don't bother casting on them if they still have good MR. (If the first three spells don't land, probably none of them will.) A good old-fashioned beat-down may be your best choice; unless they can interrupt you well, you're winning if your mana > their health. If you're below level 30, you should be able to stand your ground reasonably well.<br />
<br />
If you can land anything at all, Mark of Retribution is a great spell to land, albeit that requires you to be in your 50s. Stuns are not worth your time against melee, but they are good for interrupting casters. Keep your first few buff slots open when fighting a class where debuffs - especially dots - are an issue. A shaman with good MR is your worst enemy. Try to keep the relevant resists up, and Blessing of Piety as 10 percent can make a big difference.<br />
<br />
To that effect, a tash stick is a good weapon to fight with at least until you get it to proc. Other than that, try to have a decent fighting weapon; the summoned line of hammers works just fine. If you're too low for that, a good ratio weapon is probably more important than one with a proc on it. Aside from more emphasis on resists and HP/AC, your gear will probably not change a great deal. Big resist items like Weight of the Gods are extremely helpful though.<br />
<br />
Other than that, not much else I can think of.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have to disagree. I duel for fun with friends often as a 58 cleric. I load all my stuns. Remember if you're doing no buffs but what a person has available to them per their class, a melee is gunna get OWNED if you just chain stun em. root and stun, and if root breaks from stun you got time to land it again. Finish em off with your best nukes and boom done. Works for casters too,  though the pet classes have a slight advantage agaisnt stuns, root their pet, and take the caster out, pets are not worth concentrating on.  When finghting casters your bash is an excellent tool as well. Punk ass necros can't tap you if they can't cast it.  Don't sweat it if you get dotted, any dot someone can cast on you will wear off if you keep yourself at reasonable health levels. I cannot repeat it enough.. STUN.. some fo the long stuns let you do rude thnigs, I love to hit a person with a long stun and sit in front of them and change spells just to be obnoxious hehehe.<br />
<br />
There is the blind/nuke method... which is also pretty simple, just blind your opponent and nuke em, then move off behind em so they don't see you immediately after blind wears off...  wash rinse repeat.<br />
<br />
Be careful of chanters and have your hammer and Yaulp up.. chanter will mez you and drain your mana.. necro will try that too, but  as I said concentrate on the necro, not the pet. I say keep yaulp up as most people can regen it's casting cost in one tick and then it ups the standing mana regen and melee.. YaulpV+ anyways. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</td>

The stereotypical duel is usually myself agaisnt a Dark Elf SK/Mage/Necro type, and as such, I probably need to polish up my pvp skills to a point where I can handle fighting two things at once (pet/caster).  *Sighs* Why can't we all just get along. /rolleyes</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Charrlee, the reason I say not to use stuns is because even though you tie up the melee, you're also largely tying yourself up while draining your mana and not doing a great deal of damage. If I was dueling a melee that just stood there and took every stun I cast until I was oom, they would probably not die.<br />
<br />
When dueling pet classes, especially mages, just root the pet. If he uses a swarm on you, cast DA and wait for them to die. With a necro, you just have to try to keep him from liching so he actually CAN go oom, which means either posing enough offensive threat that he doesn't want to (although they can lifetap so this usually doesn't work) or dispelling him. SKs...well...if they have good MR, they'll probably give you hell.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I managed to get second at the GM contest put on in the Rathe Arena back in the day.  I was 49 and thus entered the 45-52 casters category of challengers.  You can see I was two levels below standard and thus I didnt have high hopes for doing all that well... was just looking for a good time.   Well quite to my surprise I faired quite well in the all out battle.  It was an every man for himself type fight.  I did well b/c I was not percieved as a great threat... and when someone engaged me I was able to heal myself... something they apparently weren't quite ready for.  Several of the nukers tried to take me out.. but were discouraged when we would exchange nukes... and then I would heal myself, leaving them low on mana with no results, they ran off.  So i wandered around the arena finding the ones who where trying to hide, low on life, and picking them off one by one.  I had a horse by this time.. which was quite the advantage, continual medding anyone?  It came down to me and two druids,  the druids went after each other of course, and i choose one to kill.  The final two was me and a 52 druid.  Of course he had three levels on me, which was a challenge. We went toe to toe for the better of fifteen minutes.  We were both OOM by this point and meleeing until we had enough to heal ourselves and doing it all over again.  Well as luck would have it over the course of thirty seconds both my symbol and my KEI wore off.. leaving me rather vulnerable.  His KEI was still intact and alas this gave him an advantage that I was not able to overcome.  The point of all this ramble you ask....?    Clerics can duel and duel well... I find that there is an inherent value in being underestimated.  And if you use all of your abilities well.. I think that you should be able to enjoy yourself easy enough as a dueler. - Hank, 65 Archon</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Crimson Potions are good vs mez types - it's a weak DoT, that practically does 0 damage to you - but it keeps mez off.  It can't be dispelled, but it CAN be cured - thus a smart bard will recognize it off the bat and get it out of the way - chanters on the other hand, dont have a way to cure that I know of.<br />
<br />
If you cant get a Crimson Potion, but know you're gonna duel in advance - go to the Karanas, or Unrest and try to get Rabies - works as above, but less dependable due to the timer.<br />
<br />
Blind melee's (doesnt do much good vs casters unless their new to PvP as they dont need to see to cast their nukes and such.  Get a se invis item - even clicky (sensate eyes have a couple charges for like 2pp in the bazaar) - this will be the key to beating a rogue.<br />
<br />
Magic Resist is one of the easiest resists to raise - so it's gonna be hard to stick.  Playing on FV though, I'd imagine that a majority arent going to have the obscene resists that can be found on the Zeks, so I'd still attempt a few spells to test the waters at least.<br />
<br />
Paladins are tough to kill - and it's hard to avoid death from a SK, dont let yourself get into low life stages or his HT will drop you like a ton of bricks - Bard's are insane in outdoor PvP it's going to be nearly impossible to win outside - inside is much easier with proper planning, as are Rangers - but if you're fighting an archer Ranger, try to touch a wall when fighting - when you're touching a wall arrows will ALWAYS miss you.  Shaman have a huge arsenal at their disposal - like bards, they're tough to kill.<br />
Against casters its all about mana ratios - if you're heals are more efficient than their nukes, they're screwed.  Necros gain mana back quick however, so you'll need to be in their face somewhat...and Shaman have endless mana at times with Canni....all in all, every fight has the potential to be tough - plan in advance if possible to counter your opponents strengths (ie. crimson potion vs chanters, touch a wall vs rangers, etc)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">If you have access to level 65 spells, Mark of the Righteous is a great choice.  It has a resist adjust of -55, so say if someone had a 155 sv magic score, it'd be like casting a regular spell (Mark of Retribution) vs a 100 sv magic score, a bit more likely to land.  And it causes 34 damage every time they hit you, instead of 15.<br />
<br />
The hammer pet can't hurt, either, especially if you can get a hold of Greaves of Vengeful Fury for the free cast of them.  It's green but the thing doubles for 75 I think.  Only has 100 hitpoints, but it's a great way to annoy a caster who has to nuke it or channel through it.  I think the key is to have it mana-free, though, because at 250 mana you might not get the caster to waste enough mana to offset the cost you paid in casting it.<br />
<br />
Bring/carry invis potions so if the person doesn't have see invis going, you can drink one (they're instant, Cloudy Potions) and make them lose their target.  Right click items with damage shields are nice for vs. melees, too.  In the end, the higher level you are, and the more healing AA points you have, the more ridiculous the fight is going to be.  Imagine healing yourself for 3915 in 1.8 seconds for 400 mana (max critical supernal remedy with improved healing 4).<br />
<br />
I'm just not sure how to take care of a smart shaman.  Radiant Cure is good for the DOTs, and keep Pure Blood up, I guess.  Dispel them early and often so they can't use the Cannibalization AA skill as effectively (some might have enough hitpoints to use it anyway, but a well-timed nuke might take care of that).  If they have the Cannibalization AA skill, and enough hitpoints to use it, and resists high enough to make your nukes worthless, they're going to out-mana you no matter what, and stay alive, even if they can only heal with Tnarg (you can dispel torpor/quiesence, and bash/melee interrupt incomplete heals).  I guess with a shaman like that, I'd wait for them to canni down to low health, then melee with hammer pet and bash them when they try to heal, and hope for the best in finishing them before they can get that heal off.</td>
