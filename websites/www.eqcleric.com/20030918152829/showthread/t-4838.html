<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">It's tough to get in on the loot in a pickup group when you're always sitting on the rear line medding. What I do usually is if I'm in an outdoor zone, I'll park my drogmor beside the mob and if I'm medding I'll just hit it with my shield. If the melees are grabbing all the loot, I'll be forced to loot as soon as the mob drops. Either that or I'll say something about sharing. Normally people are pretty good about it and loot every fifth mob or so leaving the rest for others in the group. Last night the enchanter in the group wasn't looting so I would bring stuff back to him. Sometimes I just can't be bothered with looting and happy to receive only splits. At least looting keeps the corpses cleaned up:)<br />
<br />
Letting the cleric take a beating seemed to get his attention. Pretty annoying when people are more concerned about loot rather than the rest of the group. If it gets to be too much of an annoyance, it's probably best to leave or go find another group.</td>

I have also been in groups where no one was looting, so I ask if anyone else is going to loot before I start the ninja thing. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Last night I was grouped in DL on my alt Shadow Knight (Mynka).  It was me, a Ranger, a Cleric, a Bard, and a Shaman.  There was a Rogue LFG and I asked if we could invite him to group.<br />
<br />
The Beastlord promptly stated that he hated Rogues and no way would a Rogue be invited to group with him.  I told him my main was a Rogue and asked why he hated them.  He said that most people who play Rogues are stupid.  I had to agree as my time on Merry showed me that most people who play Rogues at lower levels simply do not understand the class, they twink themselves out and try to play as tanks.  On a Rogue this will work for a few levels, but not for long, eventually you <b>will</b> get to the point where you simply cannot take hits for any period of time.  I often joke around with my guild saying that my Rogue (Devia) has exactly 4 hit points and takes great pains to avoid getting hit. ;)  Regardless of that, I have never denied a Rogue entry to a group I was in, or insulted them for their choice in class.<br />
<br />
He then started going off on our Bard, talking about how much he hated Bards.  She laughed it off at first, but he wouldn't let up, he just kept complaining and berating her for her choice in class.<br />
<br />
Soon after that he found out I was a Dark Elf Shadow Knight (don't ask me how he missed this from the beginning) and started going off on how much he hated Shadow Knights.  <br />
<br />
Now...  Normally if someone hates the class I'm playing and I'm grouped with them I will assume that it must be something wrong with my play.  Especially if the person is as vocal about his dislike for the class as our Beastie was.  But a couple people in the group had already sent me tells letting me know what I fantastic job I was doing pulling and holding aggro.  And, given this persons track record I decided not to take his comments personally. :)<br />
<br />
Needless to say the Bard and myself got fed up with his constant complaining and he was removed from the group.  To which he replied "It's ok, I can solo just fine."  And off he went.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, short sighted people like this get me frustrated.  I have had good and bad experiences with players of every class, but I would not let that ever stop me from taking someone of a specific class into my group.  Or even be as rude as this person was in constantly berating his group members for their choice in class...<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long post, had to get that off my chest! :)<br />

<br />
Was grouped with my brother's 46 cleric (been leveling her up this past week or so) in Dreadlands at the southeast ruins.  We had awesome groups all day!  A 47 warrior happened to shout for a group at the time we needed another to fill group up, and everyone was saying "yeah!  He is a good warrior!"<br />
<br />
I joined this warrior to group and we kept killing.  I mean really killing!  None of us had any mana regen on and we were hunting just like the old days.  This means no clarity Spiritual Radiance, etc.<br />
<br />
The very first time the warrior (Main tank) was down to 63 percent health he asked for a heal!  I healed him.  The warrior was pulling 2 or 3 at a time with no crowd control but mine or the shaman's roots.  He was getting all the aggro so he would be down to 50ish percent health after each round, and ask to be healed.  I soon said it was more efficient to Complete Heal him when he got down to 30 percent health.  The warrior said nothing just asked for a heal again.  I told him he was more than healthy to go out and pull at whatever his health was unless he planned on pulling 15 mobs, meaning he ws doing well and it was uneccessary to heal him at this time.  He got all mad and said that was an insult of his pulling ability!  I giggled to myself and explained that I meant he could not possibly be hurt enough on any pull as tough as he was.<br />
<br />
Still it was funny how some peoples perspectives of clerics really relate to playing the game.  Being a cleric healing in Dreadlands for a group that is nonstop pulling 1/2/3 at a time mobs is not an easy task without some type of mana regen.  With the buffs we have at that level the warrior was easily buffed to 3K hp's and even at 50 percent health they had more hp's than before I even buffed him...LOL.</td>

Playing as my monk, I put together a small pickup group to go to Seb and camp NG for a while. Had basic tank/puller/cleric/shaman/ench/wiz setup and we were going along just fine. Shaman was MLing, and we were there for about 4 hours without any problems. We port out to Nexus to do our splits in SH. Shaman gets all CHA buffed up to do the selling, and cleric says "I need all the gems for dot costs before you sell." WTF? Anyone who's been to NG (thats the Necrosis/Guardian camp where lammy drops) knows the insane amount of gems you gather up there. I'm like "Bro, we have probably 6k worth of gems, not counting the BDs. No way you spent that much on dots." Then he busts out the ol humdinger of "Well  normal groups don't make this much money so I gotta make it back when I can." Wow. I'm not a rich player. Clerics don't make much, neither do monks due to thier weight restriction, but I've never tried to pull this BS. The biggest thing is, he was only keeping the Tank and Enchanter symboled! The group agrees with me, we sell gems, give him 350pp (more than he spent anyway) for dots, then we /split the rest and /random for the rest of the drops. Cleric is having a hissy saying how he has to buy spells to keep us alive and how peridots are sooo expensive.. We all have to buy things to do our job, wheather it's spells, armor, peridots, weapons, whatever, it's all something to eventually help a group. Deal with it.<br />
PS- Ever notice how chanters almost never ask for dot cost back, even though they go through 3x the amount a cleric does?</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">So true Heelar! I have a friend who is an enchanter and she was saying to me the other day she goes through two stacks of dots a day! It would be nice if everyone understood what other classes have to spend with regards to mana and reagents. When I get a chance I try to look at other classes spells to see what it takes to cast them so I can have more respect for what they do.<br />
<br />
As far as reagent costs for myself, I've been trying to decide what's a fair way to handle the cost while grouped. What I think is fair is since they are my spells I must pay to cast them in the group. After all, the tanks, enchanters and any others I cast on are helping everyone including <i>me</i>. If they want to donate a peridot or something of equal value that is fine and much appreciated. But I should attempt to cover the costs only through dropped loot and if that's not enough, I'll go out and farm some pp so I break even. But in the end I don't think it's right to demand group members pay for the symbol as it's only transferring the cost from the caster to the recipient. Let the damn mobs pay for it!<br />
<br />
That "hissy" cleric sure got a generous donation from you guys;).<br />
<br />
P.S.: Reagent Conservation focus effect is a real saver</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, since the thread is already here...<br />
<br />
Joined a semi-pickup group last night to try Nadox. Semi-pickup in that two of my fellow groupies were known entities (the Warrior that brought me into my guild, and a Ranger from one of our allied guilds). We then picked up a chanter, a mage, and a cleric.<br />
<br />
I spirit sighted everyone, and took care of invising my warrior friend, Ranger invised the cleric, everyone else took care of themselves, off we went.<br />
<br />
Cleric got separated before we even got to the tunnels. This should have been a Clue. We gathered her up and all met up at the tunnel entrance, no problems. Ran through to Nadox and met up with the Mage (who was waiting for us there).<br />
<br />
So now we are prepping for the lava bath. The Chanter asks for some HP buffs, since Chanters are made of tissue paper and levitate doesn't work here. I tossed my HoS and STA buff on the Chanter, then tossed my Fire resists on everyone. Enchanter asks Cleric for her HP buffs. No response from cleric. Enchanter asks again. No response from cleric. <br />
<br />
Okay, then...guess not.<br />
<br />
Off we go to swim in the nice, refreshing lava. We get down to where we are ready to climb the banks to safety and I see the Cleric is dropping fast. Not a problem, says I to myself, I am used to being a healer. I toss off a few Greater Heals while merrily burning away myself.<br />
<br />
The Ranger is leading, and heads up the bank out of the lava river. Chanter climbs out, Mage climbs out, Cleric climbs out. Me and the Ogre...we can't climb out. Apparently Size Does Matter, and we are too big. (That's my guess, at any rate). Still not too big an issue, we can head back for safety, shrink and try again. I'm about to tell him to follow me back when our Invis drops and we pick up bogeys. We do what all good warriors and shamans do in that situation...we pull back a bit so that the group doesn't bite it and we die.<br />
<br />
The Ranger was on the ball. He was asking me for consent before I could even orient my self at my bind point. Meanwhile, he has tagged an elemental and I see the Chanter has mezzed it. From what I could see in group chat, it went down quickly enough. Now the Ranger is going to go drag my corpse...and suddenly I see the Cleric disappear from group and a 'Party member has gone linkdead' message.<br />
I'm thinking 'perfect timing. Ah well, wait a few minutes till they can log back in...'<br />
<br />
The Ranger asks "Where did the Cleric go?". I tell him that she went LinkDead on my end. The Chanter says, "Yeah...but not before gating."<br />
<br />
So now I and my Warrior are stuck at SoulBinder Jerra in PoK, our bodies are in lava on the side of a riverbank we couldn't climb, and the Cleric decided it was all too stressful? I assume it was because it was all too stressful, at least. I can't say for sure, because she never said a word, and disconnected immediately, so we couldn't ask what happened.<br />
<br />
It certainly wasn't because it was too rough...the other group members were alive and well. Only the two Biggies died...and that mostly because we couldn't get out of the damn lava. Once the Ranger pulled us up and we were rezed, we would have been fine.<br />
<br />
Hell, the three remaining recovered our bodies and killed a few elementals without us while we tried to figure out what to do.<br />
<br />
In the end, I brought Duhikae on and had him run to Nadox to do 20% rez at zoneline.<br />
Because it took so long, the Chanter and Mage had to leave before we could get rezzed and organized again...but at least they held till they knew the situation was under control...and the Chanter stayed until we were both up and running again, just in case the Ranger ran into trouble.<br />
<br />
Ah well. Admittedly not the worst EQ horror story, but the thread was already here. I figure at least now I can say that my 2 box Cleric is doing what he was made for...helping out my Guild when we take hits.<br />
<br />
The three remaining ended up in Dulak, where we were joined by a Paladin and a Monk...and I died again. But that's another story..</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">anyone else think not keeping enchanters full life is wrong? nija looting happends. but know this, any enchanter in a group with me is ALWAYS 100% life. they just die waaaayyy too fast not to keep them toped off. they are the only class that i will over heal just to keep 100% life. i even still keep remedy up to top them off.<br />
<br />
as far as nija looters, as soon as you join a group, ask if there is a ML, if isn't one, tell them you will do it. then before anyone leaves, or joins group, do a split. it will save you so many headaches. and when it is time for you to go, offer to go sell all the loot and split it. you will find most times the group will decline and then you get to sell the loot and cover your costs.<br />

<br />
Yeah this is probably goin to piss more than a few off but they deserve it.<br />
<br />
iilanye(64 war) sends you a tell, can you please come out to pog, we are getting whooped horribly, several folks have died and this looks to be a long CR.<br />
I reply, yah sure np.<br />
I load up gate, DA, and DB cause I always hate the zone into PoG, never know whats there besides the whorl.<br />
I get a druid friend of mine to give me a ride out to WL after I pickup half a bags worth of invis pots....<br />
<br />
I zone in and immediately see multiple corpses of an iskar shaman friend of mine,alchemyz. I look around and see a group and a half of ppl way up on the hill behind the ring.<br />
I run up and start rezzing ppl and notice that most of them are all from the same guild,Sealed Fate. I recognize a few of them from ages ago. Mobs are continually coming into camp and beating the living crap out of the ppl there because ppl kept running around with their heads up their ass only aggroing more mobs which they brought back into camp. I end up blowing most of my mana trying to keep ppl healed and a horse decides its my turn at the loadin please wait. I run him around and eventually end up rooting him. I get back and start healin ppl again(by this time I'm extremely low on mana.) I send a tell to my friend iilanye telling him that this is BS. I didn't come up to PoG to heal these screwballs and end up dyin myself.<br />
<br />
I finally am able to get on horseback and start medding again. I eventually get iilanye healed back up but I'm still lom. We start getting the mobs killed. I and the other cleric are still lom tryin to keep everyone alive and not only does the other cleric do this but 2 others start looting while the tanks are getting whooped and I'm tryin to scrounge every bit of mana to keep them alive. We ask them nicely to stop a few times and then shout it. Cleric says Oh I'll split the gems at the end of the raid. I shot iilanye a tell sayin I'm sure she will, she'll split them with herself and her two buddies. After we get all the mobs and pogs around killed I send iilanye a tell I'm taking this diamond and leaving. I didn't come up here to bottom out my faction again and get shortchanged by some greedy assed cleric. Not too long after I had left iilanye sends me a tell saying wtf! she just called the end of the raid and had the wizard AE TL to bind. I told him, yeah I figured as much that would happen. Whew! Flame off!</td>
