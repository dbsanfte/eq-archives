<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, having just over 600 days /played, I've got more than my fair share of stories to tell, for sure. I will limit it , though, to just a few! ~<br />
<br />
Some of my "greatest" EQ memories ~<br />
<br />
The opening of Hate Plane! <br />
<br />
I was on Karana Server, at the time, and I happened upon a DE in Nektulos, who had all these players surrounding him, trying to get him to talk. I don't really even remember what I had said, but back then I was very much into roleplay, so I RP'd with this fellow a bit. After a bit of conversation, he asks me if I'd like to help gather forces for the King. I said yes, of course, so he sent me on a journey to South Ro, to pick up a Troll, and bring this Troll back to Neriak. <br />
<br />
Off I went, running to South Ro, and searching for a bit, until I see a Troll sitting off by one of the Derv camps. I go up to him, say what the gentleman in Nektulos told me to say, and the Troll responded. All is well, I'm thinking, so I ask this troll to follow me home. The troll, being controlled by a GM, was MOST misbehaved. everytime we passed players that were not of evil alignment, he killed them! It didn't matter if they were busy trying to get exp, he went up and beat them down! He also had to rest like...every ten minutes. This turned into the worst babysitting job ever, and also the longest run back to Nektulos I had ever had/uhoh <br />
<br />
After finally getting this troll under control, we get to Neriak. It was pretty cool, because I ended up getting cash, a few bars of platinum, and later, after the event, Mennix gave me a custom title. The big bonus to this event, for me, however, was actually seeing Neriak's King/cool . <br />
<br />
While I later found out the event went differently per server, this is probably one of the single-coolest GM events they did.It also solidified my belief that Mennix was the best GM ever! (As an aside, my custom title got nuked when I moved servers, but the memory of the event will always remain;) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Open Fear Raid ~<br />
<br />
Opening Day of Ayonae Ro saw what was probably the single longest and worst Fear raid ever. It was an open raid, lead by one of the server's oldest and well-known Erudite Clerics, Volan. There were no guilds formed yet, so everyone was still pretty happy with each other, though people from their former guilds on their old servers stuck together, until we could reform our guilds. <br />
<br />
In any case, everyone knew of this open raid on Fear, but most of my guild at that time decided to not go, and spent time just hanging out. I get a tell from Volan, asking me if any of us could possibly help him out. Bored, I said "sure", and dragged my co-guildleader, and my boyfriend along. We get there, to the Fear portal, in Ferrott, to find that he needed our help with some nasty CR. Seems the open raid had become a slaughter. So, after talking with my boyfriend, and co-leader, we decide to plunge on in. <br />
<br />
The three of us formed a plan, then went into Fear. What we found was simply the worst case scenario you could imagine. mobs were aggro and pathing all over, corpses were already starting to get close to decay, and Cazic himself was running rampant through the plane. Not to mention, there were paniced people zerging themselves back into Fear, to try to get their corpses/sigh .<br />
<br />
I sent my boyfriend to work. He started out training mobs around for me, while my co-leader and I worked on getting resses started on key classes. We got a few done, when a nasty little monk came in, and tried training us/grr . Luckily, I was fast with the camp button, and saved myself from falling int the corpse-pile. This monk went on for a time trying to be an ass. We ended up getting GM help, to get this monk removed, but sadly, the GM wouldn't help us ress/no .<br />
<br />
After a few near-death experiences, we managed to get about 95 percent of the corpses back to their owners, and most people safely ressed. Volan did great at keeping people calm during the time, and it  took our crew of 3 about 3 hours total to get everyone. <br />
<br />
The three of us didn't step foot inside of Fear again...for about 3 months after that night/dead <br />
<br />
Those are just a couple, but I've been long-winded enough!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">How does one define their greatest moment? Is it the time you narrowly squeezed by a mob or duelist in single combat, eked by a fight with their group under incredible circumstances, or snatched victory from the jaws of defeat on a raid? Is is the time you finished a certain quest you've been working toward, or finally acquired an item off a mob you've wanted so long? Is it the time you helped someone else do that? Is it the time you helped someone else in another way? Is it the time you did something so unusual and unique that it left you proud to no end?<br />
<br />
There are so many ways you can call a time your greatest moment, or at least truly great. Obtaining your epic. Narrowly and miraculously camping out in time to save a raid force for the entire night. Helping with a rescue mission. Teaching a newbie how to play the game. There are entirely too many ways to interpret this challenge - describing your greatest moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to admit though, the times that thrill me the most are when you truly dance with the mobs -- keeping your group alive, avoiding death yourself, and assisting in or perhaps entirely handling crowd control. In my earlier days as a cleric, I was grouped in the warrior room in HK. We had a full group of people, who while partially competent, were not hardened veterans of the game. The rest of the group is all melee, for some reason at that time there were no casters in High Keep.<br />
<br />
The monk brings a pull with an accidental add. I purposefully take aggro on the add, pull him to the corner and root him away - mind you this is not a large space to work with. As the first mob is almost half dead, we get a respawn. I root it and tell everyone else to move away. The warrior tanking isn't superb but I'm keeping him alive alright.<br />
<br />
Your immoblize spell has worn off.<br />
POP!<br />
<br />
Now we've got 4 mobs and one is pissed at me. The first mob finally dies and the group grabs the root-breaker beating on me. I heal the rogue being hit by the newer pop and end up with aggro on the second heal. I pull him to the one remaining corner and park him there.<br />
<br />
You have gained experince!<br />
POP!<br />
<br />
The tank moves on to one of the other corners, and suddenly two roots break. I barely get Divine Aura off, and tell someone to tank those mobs. A ranger moves over and takes one. I move to a free corner, drop DA, and heal myself, which bring aggro back to me from the free one. Stun. Root. Move away. Finally heal the warrior that is in sore need of it, and the rogue that keeps getting aggro. Root breaks. Ranger taunts it, I root it, we move. Unfortunately one of the mobs is rooted in the doorway corner, and suddenly a hallway mob comes running in.<br />
<br />
I'm at about 40m and half health at this point, and with lots of people needing heals. As the third mob mercifully dies, we've still got 4 more in the room. There's nowhere to stand safely in this room. The monk starts tanking an add while the warrior works on one. Just as I'm about to get a heal off on the warrior, who is starting to need it, a root breaks. Your spell has been interrupted. I try to stun, interrupt.<br />
<br />
Ranger runs over and taunts it, which fails. While I keep getting beat, the warrior is down to one bubble and backs off while a rogue tanks for a bit. I finally channel a spell and move clear. I heal the rogue who needs it, while the monk mends. Heal the warrior finally. He goes back to fighting. The ranger backs off and starts tossing baby heals. The first mob finally dies, the root on the fourth mob breaks. I replant it while the group moves on to the third and leaves the monk soloing.<br />
<br />
I'm at negligible mana now. The ranger runs himself oom while I pause in the corner. I can't even cast a root on the monk's mob. (Call this mob #2.) One of the rogues takes aggro and tanks that third mob for half the fight. Just as the mob dies, the root on the fourth breaks.<br />
<br />
The warrior and the other rogue go over to it, the rest of the group finally goes to help the monk. The monk finally feigns death before he dies. The warrior has to back off. One of the rogues is low and the other is tanking a mob. I'm not looking too good either.<br />
<br />
The warrior re-engages, while the rogue still has aggro. The rogue is gonna die though. Try Greater Healing. Not enough mana. Try Healing. Not enough mana. Finally in desperation I manage to cast Daring. Warrior takes aggro, with mob still at half health. Other mob still has a good chunk left. I tell everyone to get on the monk's mob and finish it. Meanwhile the ranger somehow steals aggro. Monk dusts himself off to jump back in. Somehow that mob dies with everyone below two bubbles, most below one.<br />
<br />
Last mob is beating on, I dunno, somebody, and I manage to get off another Daring just in time. The monk mends, but doesn't matter cause he can't get aggro. I'm desperate. I sit down to try to med. Oh look, now *I* have aggro. I see no other options left...<br />
<br />
I turn auto attack on. The mob turns back to the one rogue, who is at half a bubble, when my uber velium hammer procs - I had just turned 25, first time it had done that. Probably coincedence, but just at that point the mob turns and finally starts running.<br />
<br />
Group chases him down before he can run into range of adds. I blink dumbfoundedly at the screen a few times. Group is equally astounded. After a couple exchanges, I go afk and get a soda. I need the energy, and darnit, I'm thirsty.<br />
<br />
A year and a half later, I go onto eqcleric.com and start writing about it, and when I'm about done, I look back, and say wow I wrote a heck of a lot, and apologize to the people that actually read the whole thing.</td>

Then this lone figure walks up and stops at the foot of the slope by the zone and stands there defiantly looking over the carnage and dead bodies arround him. <br />
        Knowing that Mahong can only be opperated by a GM, my DE, shaking in his newbie armor, came close and hailed him. To my surprise, he actually responded and didnt incinerate me on sight. He outright nuked the human we had with us, but spared the Dark Elves. We Roleplayed about the constant assaults on his home, the filthy Gnomes, Elves and Dwarves that loved to slay his followers ect and the beauty of his home. He was asking for Neriak Nectar and one of us actually had some thinking it was drinkable.. hehe (its for smithing only btw)<br />
        In the End, we each recieved a gift, (mine was a shield, no drop, low stats BUT had MY name in its title),about 50 plat each and a few stacks of "Feast-sized" rations.<br />
         I am Proud to say I actually shared ELVEN WINE with one of THE most mysterious NPCs in the game. I HAD a screen shot of the two of us standing side by side, but a "crashed HD" removed one of my most Prized posessions in EQ.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hmmm greatest EQ moment .......<br />
<br />
/me sits back in her chair and ponders for a moment then a smile slowly appears on her face.......<br />
<br />
<br />
I had just finished a tedious visit to Marus Seru assisting in the Recondite population control and was finally getting to return to the beckoning lands of the Faydwer. I journeyed to the Plane of Knowledge and used the Felwith Portal to return home.  Upon entering the city I happened across a young high elf looking rather confused and overwhelmed. "Excuse me Young One may I be of assistance?"  She looked up at me and beamed a large and gracious smile saying "Oh thank you!! I have been trying to find my way out of this city forever! Would you please show me the way?" "Of course," I answered her "have you trained at your guild yet?"  "Ummm train?!?" she asked once again looking confused. "You might wish to find your guild master or mistress and ask their guidance in the ways of the path you have chosen to follow."  "OH!" she replied "Ummm this may seem silly but do you know the way back to the cleric guild? I have been wandering around so long I can't remember where it is." I laughed softly and told her, "Ahh a Young Cleric! Welcome then! I am headed to seek further guidance from our guildmaster as it happens." We wandered through the streets of Felwith as I lead her to the guild we talked of her life so far.  This was to be her first venture out into Norrath and the great Faydwer!!<br />
<br />
We arrived at the guild hall and I introduced her to Yeolarn Bronzeleaf our illustrious leader and explained that she would like to train in the ways of the Great and Mighty Clerics of the Koada'Dal.  After she had finished training with Guildmaster Bronzeleaf I took her to the bank and introduced her to the bankers. "I need to get some things out of the bank do you mind waiting a few minutes until I finish?" I asked her.  "Not at all and thank you again for helping me." she smiled at me.  Upon concluding my business in the bank I handed her a few rather heavy backpacks and several platinum pieces left over from my recent spell buying excursion.  She looked at me again "You need me to hold this for you?" she asked. "No Young One this is for you. You need to buy spells and I can not let a fellow cleric run out into the Fay with all the evil little orcs out there just waiting to pounce on a person. This is the armor, shield and weapon that was given to me upon my entering into the Cleric Guild by a fellow Cleric and I wish to pass it on to you as it was passed on to me and the Cleric before me.  All I ask in return is that you pass it on to another young cleric when the time comes." And with that the fledgling cleric donned her new armor and we went to purchase her spells and get her started on the path of the Almighty Cleric.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">/em reminisces about the day I really started to shine as a Battle Cleric. <br />
<br />
LvL 51, in Kanor's Castle, LCY. We had a very nice group going, well rounded. Our group consisted of a Shammy, Chanter, Druid, Cleric (me), Pally and a wizzy. After about 2 hours of excellent killing, the Pally had to leave. We were the only ones left in zone. The shammy was only 49, but decided to pull one to try it. He got beat down pretty hard.<br />
 About that time, a 46 cleric shouts LFG. Shammy runs out, invis him passed the guards, and we now have a full group again. I tell the shaman to buff me up like a pally, and self buffed up as much as I could, got thorns from the druid and went for a pull. I learned that with multipul stuns and root, I could hold agro very well.<br />
After about 4 hours of this, the group was still going strong, and had turned down several Melee types LFG. We had a blast. When I dinged 52, I had maxxed my offense, defense and 1hb.<br />
There were a set of cobalt boots dropped, and I was given it by the group, just because they thought I was crazy. We ended up getting a few lootz and some decent exp, even though it is slow in KC, and a great time was had by all. I still get tells now and then from people who were in that group, and see me in zone. <br />
<br />
That was one of the few times I have ever had an all Caster group be extremely successful. I learned alot about holding agro, and the younger cleric was extremely inspired and motivated by what he had seen me do.  Since that day, Battle Cleric has become my passion, even though I still do very well in groups as well.  Now, if we get an add, I just pull agro, take mob to the side and melee it until I can get a root off.  Some tanks freak out when they see the cleric getting beaten and drop thier mobs to "SAVE ME." I just tell them to deal with thier own mob, I got this one.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think the Moment I will remeber most in EQ was a Little Night in Fear.<br />
<br />
/em Sits back in his chair as the memories come back to him as if it where just last night......<br />
<br />
I had met 2 dark brothers one night while traveling and Although they where from the Dark side we got along Ok. They seemed to listen to me when I talked about the Mother and Seemed intent Although they have never converted their dark ways we are still friends. We would perform raids on such evils as the Plane of Hate and Plane of Fear really hurting the dark one's chance to spread their dark ways. Well one night on one of these such ventures into the Plane of Fear we had gather around 30 other people together to make a good Dent into the minions of Cazic-Thule. Everyone of us us where in between our 55th to 60th Year of Adventureing the world of Norath. Right before we are ready to Go in and start to make a safe place for everyone to gather Exmortis got a urgent call for his home and had to return to Neriak. 3 others had to return to their homes also. Well Myself and Shadora decide to lead thes adventurers in still. Well we enter and promptly are set upon by CT's Minions. We clear a good area to alow us to get everyone gathered together and start through our Spells of Protection on each other. This was my first time to go against the Minions of Cazic-Thule and All of a Sudden Shadora Disappears. He is no where to be found. 5 others also disappear at the same time. So Here I am looking at the faces of about 25 or so people. Some where dark brotehrs and sisters other where from the Wood lands. there where 2 particular people that came up to me. they where from the mountains region known as Butherblock. I had adventured with them before but just barely knew them. Fidelity and Fumblefoot where the names they went by. They told me well it is all on your shoulders now High elf. What do you mean i asked. These people are looking at you to lead them into battle. What do I know about Battle I am a Healer and I am always at the back trying to help keep people alive. The dwarven couple a cleric like myself and a warrior said they would offer there help and assistance. So I accepted and We are fighting and Doing very well when Over the hill comes strolling this BIG BIG skelotal Dragon. Everyone gasped and Backed away and Hid near the Skelotal tower we had just cleared. About half the people where saying we where doomed and where in a semi state of Panic. When we finally got them calmed down I turned to my Dwarven friends. They informed me that this dragin was named the Drackoliche. They told me it would not be the best idea to disturb him and to let him wonder away. How can we let something like that just wa=onder around at its own will? We talked about it and they said I would make the final decision and they would support me and Back me up. So I told the people gathered around me that we where going to take on this drake and we would prevail. I got them into an uproar. I told our Monk to Go and Bring that thing back. While the monk was away following the orders he was given you could here the seed of dought start to place itself in the minds of this army that had been placed in my hands. I was getting people telling me I was crazy that this band of people that did not really know each other had no buisness taking on a creature of such power as the Drackoliche. Well incomes the Dragon and Fumblefoot ran to meet the chalenge. Fidelity and myself  ran with him to heal whatever wounds this dragon would try and inflict. the others where a little relctant but follow us in, but did not want to watch us Go to a certain death if they did not help and one by one they strated joining us, soon the battle cries from Grobb, Halas, Kelethin, Ak'anon, Felwithe and everyother city from around Norathe rang across the battle field. in the end the Drackoliche's corpse lay before us. He did not go alone but through the will of Tunare and Brell myself and Fidelity where able to revive our fallen companions with little loss for themselves.<br />
<br />
As I look back this is one of the memories that stands out for me. Shad went linkdead for almost 7 hrs. I had never led a raid and Had no idea anything about the plane of fear. This was first venture in there and I ended up have to lead the raid. Fid and Fum where the best help I could ask for. they gave me information on where to move and What areas to have the Monk pull. they told me that We might have a chance at the drach but it would be risky and told me to go for it Why not. if it where not for their help that night i would have called that raid as soon as Shad went LD because I did not want to lead them into a bad CR as I had never been there.<br />
<br />
Of course my epic comes to mind I was actually Hyper-venalating when i completed it.<br />
<br />
But this moment with an open raid with 3 char at 60 (max at the time) and the rest around 55 56 and taking down the Drach just made me feel good. About 2 weeks later we took and open raid into hate and Actually Killed Inny. Something we had been told would never be done. No open raid can kill a god because they where all about team work and no open raid could perform to that level. The people that usually came to our raids where actually needing the armor drops from these planes. The was a gorup of about 10 of us that did not need anything but kept coming back to help others.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The absolute BEST time ever was when my guild leader *Shameless advertisment*<br />
~Inconceivable~ on Saryrn and I got desperately bored. On a whim we decided to visit Western Wastes. Seeing as we were both on CoV faction at the time, we explored for a while, then decided.. Yup.. Lets kill a dragon! We set up to the far left of the cleft that opens into ToV, and he tried to pull one singly from the wandering dragons up top. After many deaths, we decided to change tactics and go to the dragons instead of waiting for them to come to us. We scouted out a nice pretty one, Pantrilla, teased her a bit about her name and set to. We died the first time, but got her the 2nd with just myself, a 58 cleric at the time, and him, a 65 shamman. I have her talisman in the bank as a reminder of that EXTRA fun time. The faction hit was disastrous though, as i was still trying tooth and nail to get ally status with CoV to get my SS armor. We killed another for good measure and called it a night. On the bright side, we're NToV now, so i look forward to many more early morning dragon murders!<br />
<br />
What i learned from this - An idle shamman is the devils playground!! :D</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I can recall many good times in EQ, I am very lucky to have alot of RL family that plays the game and sometimes even get to group with them.  To narrow it down would be almost impossible, but I can think of at least one time that sticks out in my mind the most, as a turning point in my EQ adventures.<br />
<br />
I had just switched from sharing a 52 Mage w/ my husband to playing my own character and having her moved to her own account.  I was running through the EC tunnel and spotted some friends and stopped to give them a hug.  Up pops and invite to the group, so I hit follow and sit down adding myself to the little circle.  One of the nicest people I have met on EQ, at the time my GL, tells me that she is thinking of moving on and leaving the guild to someone. She said that as I went running by she realized that I was the one that should fill her shoes.  At the time I was only lvl 18 and thinking ya right everyone is going to love this LOL. We talked for a long time and decided that we would get me to at least lvl 20 and then announce to the guild her intentions.  <br />
<br />
We all met in Gfay for a guild meeting (remember those? lol)  and she began to tell everyone what her plans were and that she intended to hand the guild down to me.  Afterwards I answered lots of questions about my goals for the guild and ways I intended to deal with problems etc.  Needless to say I was shaking like a leaf, but couldn't be prouder of being the leader of such a great bunch called Destiny's Crusaders.<br />
<br />
Over the following months the guild grew and we began to raid and adventure together. I made many good friends in that time and still talk and group with alot if not most of them. Some have even come to join the guild that I am currently in and others are applying.  But alas I was told that I needed surgery and had to take a short break. While in the hospital I recieved flowers from 2 of the members and upon coming home found countless emails.  The first time I was able to log back on they threw a party for me in the arena and we had a great time exchanging language skills and killing each other!!  It came a time though that do to my health the stress and time it took to run the guild became to much for me, so I handed down to a still very dear friend of mine.<br />
<br />
That was the turning point in EQ for me, I met alot of the people I now call friends on this game and learned the feeling of pride in something you helped to grow and bringing many people together to enjoy the game and each other.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I had been in the same guild from Level 8 until Level 65.  The PoP expansion was tough on Medium, Casual guilds and soon after its release, we realized that our guild was dying.  We had been able to easily kill mobs such as Vindi, Velks, DS, RC, but suddenly we started to lose people.  One day lost to Vindi because of lack of DPS -- the utter frustration of seeing a once trival mob slowly wipe us because we couldn't keep up with his natural regen is indescribable.  The options for the guild were 3  -- merge with a like minded guild, disband and move on, or watch our guild further decline as we continued lose people.  We decided to merge and found a guild with similiar values in the same situation.  Despite  several months of "testing" out the idea of a merger and being excited at our future, the moment that I sat done in the stables of the bazaar with my closest chanter buddy and watched the guild tag disappear, then I hit F1 and typed /guildremove I was crying in RL.  <br />
<br />
With that background in mind and my most humbling moment in EQ being at the hands of Derek the Vindicator, the day that my guild, filled with old friends and new friends, killed all the boss mobs in Kael had to be the best.  We started with King Tormax for breakfast and ended with killing the Avatar of War.  It was truly a triumphant day.</td>
