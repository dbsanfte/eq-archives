<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Howdy all, I was curious.  I have been in a few groups recently where the leader wanted to do an LDON raid but there were no classes that could help regen mana.  I am only level 37 so I can't take a KEI yet and clarity will only last about the first 15 mins after we mess around buffing at zone, getting adventure and whatnot.  <br />
<br />
Is this a typical train of thought for group leaders?<br />
<br />
I am apprehensive to group with no bard/chanter because when we get unexpected adds, I end up healing many people at once (besides MT) and can go oom quickly with only 3 mobs attacking simultaneously.<br />
<br />
My gear is probably average for my level, and I don't see much opportunity to get more wis/mana at the moment.<br />
<br />
I am using superior heal and greater heal in order to maximize my mana efficiency and I also have mana pres II and improved heal II items.<br />
<br />
I HATE to have people die on my watch and I have no desire to start losing LDON adventures by holding the group back while they wait for me to get mana.<br />
<br />
Am I being foolish and prissy to want to have a mezzer/crack dealer?<br />
<br />
Any responses will be read thoroughly and given reasonable thought.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Did a successful mid-50s LDoN in Rujarkan Hills last night on a hard setting with no mana regen.  Hovered between 40-70% mana the entire mission.  KEI would have allowed me to add some DPS and/or more stuns but other than that, it wasn't missed by the group.  I never once asked for a med break.  Actually, the only med break we got was near the end when our MT (an SK) ran out of mana because <i>his</i> KEI dropped and without mana he couldn't aggro lock.  :p <br />
<br />
My group was cleric (me), bard (puller), sk (MT), rogue, beastlord, and another sk (offtank when needed).  Melee heavy and very disciplined about aggro control.  Other than the occasional mulitple pull, I was able to pretty much stick to healing only the MT.  We were all pretty much average geared for level and we had about 15-20 minutes left on the timer upon success.<br />
<br />
At lower levels LDoN should be easily doable without mana regen.  Mana regen is more for overcoming group weaknesses than for succeeding with a decent group.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'd also make sure that if you have no CC, talk to your group beforehand about who will handle adds and how they can be handled.  A suggestion I usually make is I can tag the add or heal immediately to get the adds aggro and then move it away from the group and then root park.  Without the group knowing about it, someone will surely try and come to your aid and go offtank the add, which is terrible on da mana.  Things gets more hairy when there are multiple adds, but if you can pull one off at a time (using stuns, don't heal because you'll get aggro from all the adds), and you have the space, you should be able to root park.  <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">someone already said it but agro control is the issue, with a Pally MT they can EASILY get agro on multiple mobs AND hold it with their stuns and taunts combined, yes it takes some skill but can be done.  An SK can do it as well, again it takes a bit of skill but can be done.  Its pretty hard for a warrior to do it before they get AE Taunt so it might be a bit hard there.<br />
<br />
And you forget with a cleric you are NEVER with out a Crowd Controller, no you dont have mez per say but you do have Ghetto mez, use it.  Keep a stun up to gain quick agro to ghetto mez (as someone already mentioned). <br />
<br />
But no i dont like doing LDoN's without a chanter or a bard, note i only have FT3 so not really that good atm, i love having their mana regen and haste.  Hell, i love having both a bard and chanter, Bard pull incredably well and can add haste on top of the chanter haste =).   But I wont say no to a LDoN group just because they dont have a chanter or bard (unless its a hard dungeon, than i say you pretty much have to have some sort of mez)</td>

I put together a group earlier today.  Myself (65 cleric), 2 65 sk's, wiz, mag and shammy.  3 minutes into the dungeon, something came up, and the shammy had to log.  Things cam come up, it happens, what you do from there is the key.  We sat for a minute to <u>discuss</u> each remaining persons job duties, as it was apparent NO ONE wanted to quit (woot).<br />
<br />
We finished the mission with 20 minutes to spare, and the lowest mana I had was 68m.  All the mobs were NOT slowed.  Now, I will add, one of the SK's had 214 8) AA's which helped immensely.</td>

What I do when I'm on my baby cleric (lvl 40) and have had no probs yet, minus the reg poons that you get on pick up grps.  Once grp mates become members of the purple club they tend to listen closer to your mana reports.  Not that Im saying threaten them with it (good rep is nice to have), but when you say LOM or OOM and they don't listen land that last heal right when their eyes are closing for the trip to bind.  The likely hood of losing exp usually gets the attention of most.  If not, well thats another story for a nother time :p  The missions are fairly often easy then not, to have to worry about it too much.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">If i remember right, the only difference i found going with or without was that on withouts i mainly stuck to healing and the occasional root. if chanter was in group i would have extra mana to nuke or stun some. we still seemed to get them done pretty quick. a lot quicker than higher lvl ldons. <br />
<br />
If you lack dps. i would not be ML. it does cut into your medding time. was actually in a heavy dps group where my healing was hardly needed and on that one i MLd. <br />
<br />
Some things i would suggest is to be as efficient as possible with your sitting. I'm only 55 so i dont have yaulp yet so for the most part on dungeons i sit as much as i can. the only time i stand are when i cast, move up or am afraid sitting will get agro. i've seen a lot of casters who move up on the call and then just stand there. <br />
<br />
another thing i did was remap my keyboard so i dont use the mouse. have spells hotkeyed to numbers, but have targeting, hotkey heals, sit/stand and assist all hotkeyed to my number pad. this lets me target, stand, cast and sit as quick as i can (also will save your butt in laggy situations). always have your target aquired before you stand. if you stand then get your target you are losing mana regen. if you are nuking have the toggle last 2 targets hotkeyed to something. lets you toggle between tank and mob quickly. in my mind i try to think of sitting as my correct state and standing as an oddity. keeps me from forgeting to sit down. Hopefully this will change at 56 when i get my first hammer and yaulp. i cant wait to melee some :)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As everyone has said before make sure everyone knows tank taunts and rangers watch when they snare and or root or dot. I have found if I have to heal a bunch of toons mana goes fast. I have found that if you are low on mana let the group know and if others are getting aggro dont heal them unless they are really low on health. I have found toons tend to be more careful at getting aggro when they are at 60% health inbetween mobs and I am not healing them right away because I am saving my mana for MT. Also when you hit 39 you will have CH which will help because you dont want to start casting CH until MT is at 30% health if a warrior or at 40% if MT is not a warrior.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have done a lot of LDON's with no mana regen and I do not usually have a problem. As said before when the cleric is OOM the puller will hold, unless they wantsto try to do it without cleric heals... they usually do not want to risk dieing so they wait.. :)<br />
<br />
Also, agro control is a huge factor when there is no mana regen....I was in a LDON a week or so ago when I told the wizard that I was not going to continue healing them when they took agro because they nuked things and then ran instead of letting the warrior taunt it off... She eventually listened and let the tanks get agro before nuking...<br />
