<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">So kinda of an interesting story, this other cleric last night cracked me up. I was on my 60 druid last night helping out guildies (No the druids not my main, thank God. She's just around to plvl, port and make money). So I ported them into DSP and the got agrooed immediately, and one died. So, I ported back into the nexus, and shouted that i'd pay anyone well that would come with me to do a 96%. I got no one... so I shouted again...nothing... Finally i offered 200p for the person that came with me... I get a tell from a cleric "I only got a 90% but i'll go." That's all i'm getting, so I'll go with that. I pay the chick 200p invite her to the group and i'm about to port. She tells me, what for so and so.  I invite him to the group and off we go. We get there, she goes over and rezes this guy first than turns to me, "are you gonna pay me for this one too?" "No, that's not my rez" He thought she was rezing him for free and whatnot, she feels ripped off, starts going off. He gives her everything he has on her. But, she's still yelling. I finally tear her away to follow me for my rez. She stops and rezes another guy and he only gives her 12p. OMG She goes off about that. She starts shouting to the zone about how she came all this way and had to find a port (Um, hello you were paid to port here!) and all these people give her are 12p! The gems used to cast the rez cost more than that!  /eek Now, i'm kinda wondering if this is a e-bay twink or something. Give the kids a break. Not everyone can pay 200p for a rez. Meanwhile, she hasn't even done the rez that she's been brought here and paid to do and she informs me she's now out of mana. So I finally get her to do the rez and she won't even heal my poor guildie after she rezed her, i have to do it. I'm ready to port all of us back to the nexus to get rid of this chick. But, of course we can go back til she's full mana. She finally permits us to go back (thank you masta') and she never disbands. I kept talking to my guildmembers and she keeps butting in so i finally disband her. She finds me and starts yelling "what the hell! You disbanded me!" "Yeah i'm loggin, i'll talk to you later." And I got on my cleric. She was sitting in the nexus yelling that she wants a guild and my bf ran through and saw that and was about to invite her, but I stopped him. He's like, "She's s high level cleric." "Yeah, I don't want to have to pay her everytime we need a favor" /rolleyes.<br />
Okay, so I understand that we to need money and we can't always do everything in the kindness of our hearts. We need to survive as well, but I've found that sometimes your good deads come back to help you when you are in need. I don't mind rezing someone for little or  no money when they are in need. At the same time, I've had people port me and buff me for free when i've needed a corpse run. I play a cleric to help people. I understand her frustration with the first guy thinking he was getting rezed for free. But, shouting to the zone was a little extreme. Especally since she made 200p being brought there and lost no money doing a couple extra rezes. She's the type of person i would expect to collect plat for heals in a group as well.  <br />
Am I alone here? I'd like to think clerics are here for the betterment and help of the world. My experience with her saddened me.</td>

When people ask me for a rez I will help them if I am available and not squabble about how much (if anything) they pay me.<br />
<br />
In your example, the person was being greedy IMHO.  They had already been paid 200pp... which is more than enough.  It's not like she gave everyone who ran by a Symbol buff that required a cost element or something.  Be kind, and eventually, you will get that kindness returned.  You will run into some jerks along the way unfortunately.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">That's insane! But I've come across some stingy clerics myself. If I rez someone and they donate I'll pop a symbol on them along with healing and other buffs. But this one level 55 cleric the other day rezzed me for 90% and since I dislike rezzing someone for nothing I gave them 100pp (all I had on me at the time) they didn't even heal me! <br />
<br />
Of course I was thinking "what a prick" the entire time I was medding to heal myself but I wouldn't start yelling out about it.<br />
<br />
But of course if I see a low level cleric while I'm running through a zone I'll stop and throw my bigger buffs on them. We have a hard enough time as it is dealing with out "pets" we should at least treat each other with more curtesy then I've gotten from some clerics in the past.<br />
<br />
And so someone doesn't mistake this as me taking a shot at them... I rez other clerics for free and don't even accept their donations =)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">That is kind of amazing to hear but I can deffinately imagine it happening.  Since I have been a cleric I have offered the highest lvl rez that I had if someone was asking for a rez even when it was only like 10 percent or so.  I came from playing a monk that is lvl 52 and it got to the point with him that I wouldn't even ask for a rez, loss of level or not, because of the fact that as a monk I never carried much pp around with me and therefore didn't have much to offer for a rez.  Now when I rez someone with my cleric as long as my group is not very touch and go I always heal them and if they donate thats great and if not I never complain. <br />
<br />
So in my opinion if you are a cleric and can spare the mana and time to rez someone if you get paid for helping a fellow player, great, but if not, that should be ok too.  If you dont have the mana and or absolutely expect a certain amout of "donation" make sure they know upfront or just say no.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Wow, what a jackass she was!  <br />
<br />
My first character was a shaman, I created the cleric because I enjoyed helping people.  I have never charged anyone for a rez.  I think in my 30's I was really broke and ran around and did rezzes for donations, but wasn't even making it a requirement.  I think I ended up doing like 5 rezzes and didn't make any pp.  ;)<br />
<br />
If I'm not doing anything and I see someone /ooc that they need a rez, I'll definately go.  As long as they can get me there, why not?  I'm not doing anything anyway.  Heck, I've even done rezzes on the fly while I'm grouping, as long as my group doesn't mind (it's normally guildies so of course they dont!).<br />
<br />
And not healing?  That's part of the whole process.  :/<br />

It is truly a shame that you had to encounter such a selfish and inconsiderate person.  Hopefully you won't have to deal with that again.  :(</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Honestly I feel that clerics like that should be drug into Velks Lab with no invis, no mana, and we should have a druid root them there until The Almighty comes and knocks their heads hard enough for some sense to maybe pass through.<br />
<br />
I understand completely the frustration that clerics get when it comes to money/rezzes/buffs, etc.  It kind of erks me, yes, that I'll stop what I'm doing, go across 20 zones, get trained, come back and rezz myself, then follow the person again only to have them get lost for an hour and a half until they find some kind of "landmark" which they recognize, and then rezz them for a donation of 7pp because "that's all they have on them".<br />
<br />
But do they know that it erks me?  Very rarely when I have had a bad day IRL and I should have logged on my little twinky monk to just beat on something.  I try to stay patient, but granted, that is not always easy.<br />
<br />
Her attitude on the whole thing was completely wrong.  Perhaps I also haven't gotten high enough in game, but to my knowledge, all rezzes do not require a gem to cast..unless there's something I missed post 55.  So obviously she was an e-bayer to have no idea what spells use a gem cost.<br />
<br />
I agree with Dexius, I don't usually charge for my rezzes, but I do throw the "donations welcome, but not neccessary" line out there when I'm bored and just wanting to do a good deed for the day.  After I rezz, if I can I throw the whole wham of buffs on em.  HP, AC, and if they're donating enough to cover the cost, I'll slap symbol on them.  Regardless of what all I cast on them, the one that ALWAYS is done, is a heal.  It makes possible near-by mobs not even look at them.  To not even have that common courtesy...just to me seems a little selfish in a way.<br />

I've ALWAYS rezzed for free and very rarely taken donations.   I think once I took a donation because I was taken to a zone and didn't have a way back. <br />
<br />
I always at least heal them and if I have the mana, I'll throw a HB on them as well.<br />
<br />
/boggle.  Sounds like a few clerics on my server.  Makes me wonder how they even got that far....</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'm glad to see that i'm not the only one she upset. I am also one of these people that will rez for free even when it takes my time. I even cast a rez on corpses as i run by them so see if I can help somebody out. I'm one of those scary people that chases newbies through low level zones shouting "Wait, let me buff you!" and, when I rez you, you get the full deal, rez, heal, buff. i won't rez you til I can completely heal you cuz I don't want to put you into any danger either.  I pay well for anything that i get. I feel bad giving someone 30pp for KEI and ports. I always try to give at least 40-50pp for KEI's and ports. And they get at least 100pp to do my whole group when i pay for it. And, that explains why i only have 132 plat to my name and i can only afford periots like 5-10 at a time. But if i don't get paid its no biggy. Its just mana, and I was gonna get the spell anyways. <br />
But, i see her around all the time now, but she doesn't know its me cuz she met me on my druid. My boyfriend started messing with her yesterday and we think she is a total twink. He made me come in the room and see his screen. She shouted to PoK "why are there so many people in the Plane of Knowledge?" to which the bf responded "Cuz its great xp!" More people started shouting about how they got 3 levels in a day there and stuff. It was pretty funny to read. She's also gotten into and kicked out of a guild already. And, she went to someone else trying to get into a guild last night and he told her he thought the guild was full and they couldn't invite any more. She was also shouting in the nexus that she paid someone for a kei then went link dead and she didn't get her kei. With the money I gave her she shouldn't be so cheap. I see her being black listed on the server honestly.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Players like that are just "Sad", be they any class, race or level. They can sometimes have the ability to "Suck" the fun right out of a gamming session if you let them. I use my /ignore on these players as soon as they become apparent. Why? cause i don't even have the time of day for them. They dont learn, they never seem to get the hint that they are acting like jerks, or maybe they dont care...<br />
<br />
  I encountered one of these "Special Players" once during a "Trak Hunt". This player went LD right at the start of the battle and must have logged back in somewhere near the end and spent a good 10 minutes shouting to the zone and ajoining zones as we made our way out, how "I" refused to regroup her before the battle ended. I tried, unsuccessfuly mind you, to calmly explain that as the Primary Cleric, I was more concerned with the Tanks Hps than ensuring that a lost group member was in for the exp and loot. She didnt buy this and I swore to never hunt big game with a "pickup group" again.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: There is one on every server.. one in every class and one in every race..  best a player can do is refuse to tolerate that BS and use /ignore or /report. /sigh</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Wow.  I have a story too (My first post here LOL)<br />
<br />
Im a 36 Cleric and this happened when I was 35.  A friend of mine needed a rez in "the overthere", but I was REALLY REALLY busy so I asked her to wait if possible.  She did but attempted to find another cleric in the zone.  He was somewhere between 34-38 because he could only rez for 50%, the same that I can.<br />
<br />
Anyway, she actually offered 100pp for this cleric to rez her.  He stated it was (AND I QUOTE) "Not nearly enough money for my time".<br />
<br />
When she told me I was pissed off.  How dare he say that, then INSIST on more money for a 50% rez.  Of course, I dropped what I was doing, went overthere to ironically the overthere, then rezed her for free.  I wanted to give the cleric a peice of my mind but she didnt want me to, and gave me the 100pp instead.<br />

I'm setting up a ME group in DSP to camp tribals.<br />
<br />
I have 2 peeps on there way.<br />
<br />
I shout /ooc ME group needs more<br />
<br />
then I see someone pull from the tribal and I look and this party is there.  Now they were camping by the GE zone line and pulling from this ME camp which was fine.<br />
<br />
Now I get about 5 mins later<br />
<br />
/ooc ME group if you don't have a kill we're taking camp sorry.<br />
<br />
so I move over to GE and join a group setting up over there.<br />

Then someone cries out in /shout Me group needs a rez.<br />

Well they didn't ask me and usually I volunteer (and don't charge for rezzes every) but this time I said screw them.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The thing that really frosts my cookies (love that expression...thankyou America) is when you do rez people and they don't say thank you! I don't expect money and will refuse it...take it if they insist but usually don't get anything. I like fly by healings and buffings, especially if you have KEI and time to spare.<br />
<br />
I was at Guthrak beach last night soloing looking for drops for spells, and the mobs are tough there so you need all the mana you can get. I had KEI but still plenty of downtime between kills. I had only been there 20 minutes when I get three requests one after the other to Rez...which i do...which means more downtime and less me doing what i came to do. They said thankyou which was nice. Fourth person then asks me and i say that i have no mana and am medding. He then has a go at me for not doing it having rezzed the other poeple (all in different groups i might add)...needless to say he didn't get a rez from me as i will not take bad manners.<br />
<br />
I then got a request from a chanter to rez the friend she is powerlevelling (lvl 60 chanter) and could i go to the Nadox crypt zone to do it as thats where the body is....um...clerics not known for invis and the run there is lethal even to a 50 cleric. Eventually she drags body and says do i need a kei...i say mine will drop soon so thanks. I think a nice scratch my back situation...i rez...they run off! I couldn't believe it being stiffed by an enchanter...usually the most generous of classes (after clerics of course). Shortly after...another rez request...actually in the crypt this time...he says he will come fetch me and camo me to get there cus of the aggro. I go and heal him, a 59 druid...what does he do...he ports out after saying thanks. I am stuck there as i can not get back through the tunnels due to the mobs and the camou dropped when i healed/buffed him....so i had to gate back to nexus and then do the run through warrens to get back.<br />
<br />
So....i do love playing the cleric because you can be very altruistic and help people a lot....but sometimes you do just feel that people are taking the piss (excuse the language).<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">You know that thank you part gets me too. And not even when its me. My group got trained by shrooms in DSP one night and we all died. We were all bound elsewhere so I asked my bf who was hunting there to shout for a rez. So he find some chick and she rezes my entire full group. then, she brings over an enchanter to KEI the entire group as well. So, I tell the group i'm giving her 200pp for her services, you may give her more. Not only did they not offer her anything else, but they didn't even thank her. /no and, to top that off they didn't thank me either. So, i ran off and went back to DL and grouped there. I'm not gonna group with people who aren't even thankful. <br />
The scary thing is that some of my horrible stories about ungreatful people are guild members, and that really ticks me off. Not all, but i've got like one or two people who expect everything from us and i don't even get a thank you from them for helping. The guild member from my original story, the one that needed rezed, and i paid so much to have rezed and went to all the trouble to get a 90% rez cuz my 75% wasn't good enough for her level 35 self, never even thanked me. She instead continued to go off about losing her KEI (which the bf and I have told her countless times as a 35 ranger  you don't really need one) that i paid for in the first place. So I offered to fork out money to reKEI her and she refuses it, and sits there pouting. I'm still in awe. She's the one that insists on following the bf and I to places that I'm barely high enough for and bitches when she dies (I refuse to take her to Drogga with us... that i've put my foot down on). :| Then i found out that she's still bitching about the whole instance to some of my RL friends.<br />
You know, I'm complaining about people a lot, and I'm glad i'm not the only one that has issues with people, but seriously, back to life.<br />

I get asked for Virtue all the time and I have sometimes given it for free or a few plat, some people give me a p-dot or 2. But im the type of player that likes to help out others, what you do definitly comes back to you in return. The other day I was hunting in PoV (love that place) I was at GY and someone asked me for a Virtue I said sure thing, he gave me 5 p-dots I told him no just one would do fine :)  Im not here to rip anyone off. Same thing with rezzes if someone shouts across zone or something, i tell them if im in a group bring to me and ill rez. Someone tried to donate 300pp to me, why i have a click stick didnt cost me a thing. So they were very greatful. Same thing on my druid I couldnt tell you the last time I charged for a port. I guess im just saying if everyone is nicer it makes everyones day better. :D Now lets get them enchanters to lower there prices for KEI, LOL!!!</td>

LOL since when does it cost a gem to rez?  <br />

My all time personal favorite is the person that drags a corpse and drops it at you feet then hails it.  No "please", nothing but a "Hail, %t's corpse" and then get huffy with me when I "Hail" it back.:D</td>
