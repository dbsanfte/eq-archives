Its not just high lever spells anymore that are way high priced i also saw unswearving hammer of faith the other day for 4k LOL.<br />
I was lucky tho, i traded a crappy hammer worth 700pp for judement and enforced reverence at the time i knew i was getting an alright deal but i didnt know the extent to it. Doing a PC on those spells Judgement the cheapest ive seen is 5k and the stun spell was the same. And 5k is rare! thats supposed to be the cheapest!<br />
<br />
Also do you guys think now that lvl 60 is not the highest lvl that 60 spells will go down in price?<br />
I totally agree with you guys blessing of aego (lowest ive seen it for is 27k) is way too expensive, especially on a cleric salary. I was acually saving up for that spell when i realized why buy one spell when i can upgrade my chars armour. I have single aego and thats fine with me.<br />
Everyone wants aego, well if you guys want it casted on you so bad why price it so that clerics cant afford it? if we cant afford it then sorry lol your not getting the buff.<br />
ya i know LOL when i post i always end up writing a novel ;))<br />

I have other things I have to do.<br />

I don't understand why it is worth so much! Other than the camp for the Great Saprophyte. I don't see people running around and frantically shouting "help, I'm cursed and dying!". Especially when at level 54 we get Greater Remove Curse which is around the level we'll need it anyways. The only places I've heard where a curse can be placed on you is in Ssraeshza Temple and very rarely in Swamp of No Hope.</td>

One of the spell components for the spell is exceptionally rare, (the Yaeth's page,) and I've heard it either drops in VT or in 4C of CT. That's just from the grape vine though.<br />

The bottom line is you should get Remove Curse, and not being overly concerned with GRC. I don't have it, and wouldn't mind - there have been times I could have maybe used it - but nobody died because I didn't.</td>

If your in a high level guild that sells these high dollar items.  Yes yes yes, some of the money goes into caster horses or, buying other items to help the guild, but i will hold firm that guild leaders come out the happier selling pp for the holy american dollar, or whatever currency you like to substitute.<br />

One of the things about the EQ economy is that for most items, prices are in a state of continual free-fall, while the amount of platinum in the economy tends to increase.<br />
<br />
(Yes, I know about fungi tunics and boots of flowing slime.  I said, `for most items.`)<br />
<br />
As an illustration of this, with Velious, I had enormous trouble getting hold of a copy of Celestial Healing.  I was level 53 when I finally scribed it.  The standard price for the spell at the time was 4,000pp and I could no more get hold of 4k than I could fly; I think the most I'd ever had was 1,300pp at the time.<br />
<br />
Nowadays Celestial Healing is a few pp in the bazaar, and people sell the spell to vendors.<br />
<br />
Well, the same is happening and will continue to happen to PoP spells.  There are some people who have enough platinum to fill their spellbooks first, and they'll pay the prices.  Once those people have filled their spellbooks, prices will come down until the next bunch of people are prepared to pay to fill their spellbooks, and then they'll come down again.<br />
<br />
Eventually rune spells will sell for a few thousand pp, but in the meantime there are a lot of people hunting for the spells and competition forces the prices up.<br />
<br />
As for guild leaders making RL cash... the allegation's been made, and in a few cases it's probably true, but I think it probably doesn't go on all that much.  I've been leader of a raiding guild (Blood Cult on Xev) and I can tell you that guilds have a lot of things to spend their money on.<br />

The weekly peridot bill used to be a fairly enormous item all by itself.  ;)</td>

As Shadowfrost pointed out, there are a few cases where this has been true, but for the majority of high-end raiding guilds, it's not. We have literally millions in plat for our guildbank, and it gets used for setting up cross-server apps in decent gear until we get them in elemental armor, buying flags for apps/recruits, helping people doing tradeskills, recharging ress sticks, as well as the obligatory peridot/emerald/coffin costs.<br />

If you can get that far, there are people around you that have RGC. My guild stopped caring when all the non-clerics were equipped with it. Their logic was that clerics will be too busy to worry about curing curses during a fight. I live without it just fine, knowing that others around me have it.</td>

However, it only stuck out in my mind, because when we killed Rathe Council, RC, or GRC are pretty needed, and the two people I mentioned not having it, were druids /grr. We had to sub in a couple of clerics for curing duty, because of it. (They didn't even have Radiant Cure, so it was a source of much b**ching from me in tells to my guildleader)</td>

It amazes me daily how some people still don't know how to use the in-game map function, much less take it upon themselves to carry invis. Every time I see a cleric, in /gu chat say "Can someone come to the entrance of xxx zone to invis me?" I cringe and kind of want to scream.</td>
