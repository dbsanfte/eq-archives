<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I know by reading the AA FAQ that from where I am at in my AA's, I should be going for SCM next, and I will. <br />
I have a question about SCR and SCM tho (sorry if this has already been posted). I cannot afford the EE IV and Mana Preservation IV items anytime real soon, so in the mean time, will SCM and SCR be comparable? I ask because at my current level (62.5), my mana seems to really drain when I buff the group with Virtue and BoR (I usually have KEI). Not to mention, neither one seems to last very long. I get the sense that some people I've grouped with get impatient with me that I have to med up for five minutes every time I need to buff the group or rez and buff a group member, and my wisdom is capped for my level. <br />
Not sure if it matters, but I don't generally buff for donations unless someone catches me with direct tell in PoK/PoTranq.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing your input. :)</td>

<br />
SCM is your best bet.  SCR is nowhere near as important and doesn't really get effective till level 3 anyways.  You can buy level 1 and get a ceramic shield of valor which will add another 15% to your duration.</td>

I cannot afford an EE IV item, including the Ceramic Shield of Valor. It generally runs about 22-25k and up on Bertox. I generally have about 1k in the bank between spells and tradeskilling.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">You are not necessarily doing anything wrong.  Buffing a full group with single version Virtue is very mana intensive.   Having 65 and HoV will help some with that, but even then it'll take a good chunk of your mana.  And Heretik is correct that SCR will not increase your buff duration very much until level 3.  It will make some difference though.  SCRM will make the biggest difference, but that is a big chunk of AA's.<br />
<br />
Your best bet if you can't afford MPIV is to look at your FT and total mana and see how much you can increase that with what you can buy/hunt.  You can get lots of FT in LDoN without having to spend a dime if you can put some concerted effort into doing dungeons.  You can raise your mana pool by getting items with +mana through hunting in the planes and LDoN (if it isn't feasible/desirable for you to raid for them).<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Not doing anything wrong, best I can say is to try and farm the caves in plane of valor to get the shining metallic liquid or whatever it is that tends to be the most expensive part of the ceramic shield of valor and find a tradeskiller who will do the combine for a moderate fee.  I ended up paying around 10k in components and getting a friend to do the combine for mine.  Saved me about 15k.  PoP is not good for your bank account at all.  LDONs are probaly your best bet for building up some cash.  If I were you I'd just put 100% into aaxp for awhile to build up essential aa while building your bank account for some gear without worrying about the spells as much.<br />
<br />
Yaulp 6, Armor of the Zealot, Hand of Virtue, Supernal Light, Sound of Might are the only 63-65 spells that I personally consider essential so don't worry about the other ones just yet.  Save up some gear at this point is my advice if you are not in a guild that is in a position to take out mobs that will drop items that have important focus effects.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Your not doing anything wrong Veint.  Its just Virtue takes just tooo much darn mana. :p  Aye I finally got my Shield of Valor (22k cheapest on Bertox).  What I did was to farm alot of lower zones and such.  I would get a group of guildies to go farm in Seb for spells and drops with everyone knowing it was open roll on all and we are just there for loot.  I've gone to zones such as Runnyeye and farmed the named in there (Black Medallion MP2) doesnt sell for a lot, but its free and some like it for the wis and its good for alts.  BoT is great if ya can get a group away from the zone in area (i hate trains) and get to win some ornate as they sell for a lot.  Another way for ya to get to upper tiers bosses for there loot is to join channel allmustdie.  Its a raiding channel for the casual raider and the uber raiders to get together and raid when nothing is going on.  We had a chanter get an awesome staff (+15 int and lots of others) doin HoHT Crazed the other day.  If ya ever get bored or need any help just send me a tell in game.  If I think of some more Ill let ya know.  But Im sure with the amount of knowledge from peeps on here, they will answer ya before I have a chance to research it :p  Good luck )<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hit 65 first. This will up your mana pool by a fair amount alone. For cash, I don't recommend LDoN any more since that was nerfed. If you need money get a friend (tank or pet class most likely) to help you farm rare drops in zones like CT, Droga, Veksar, Sebilis. Or find something to solo but this is usually a lot more boring IMO.<br />
<br />
SCM3 should be your first goal after getting Baron, since it works on CH unlike MP IV. <br />
<br />
EE IV is nice but with the price of Ceramic Shields, I'd just save the pp to get the 8th shawl (will run you 10-20k, depends how much you farm the components vs powerskilling). 8th shawl not only is 20% ext buffs as opposed to 15%, it has FT3 which is huge also.<br />
<br />
SCR3/Mastery are nice, I'd get that after SCM3 and AA's like Divine Arb. The biggest use is to extend Supernal Elixir by 50%, making it a 3k heal. Good for Virtue, Yaulp, Spell Haste, Self Armor as well.<br />
<br />
Single V on 6 people will take 6k mana, so there's not a lot you can do about that. If you come along a group where every single person needs it, they should expect to wait after you buff (you're not 65 yet, after all). HoV helps a ton as it is 2.5k mana, less than half the cost on both mana and dots. I'd just spell haste pure casters and main slower if it's expensive on mana. If other classes request it, grant it...otherwise they probably don't need it or care.<br />
<br />
I don't have MP IV yet, but I imagine it only helps more. Ornate boots only drop in Tower of Sol Ro as far as I know, so they're difficult to hunt for and expensive as a result. With a decent FT count and SCM3 things are pretty easy though.<br />
<br />
My advice is try to get to 4k mana by level 65, even if you can't try to get close. My gear was about the same as yours when I hit 65, ~1800 HP and ~3500 mana (which is low, but not too too bad for a new 65). I always fought with KEI at these levels just so it wouldn't take too long recovering. I do even now just so I can nuke and add dps to the group (less boring to me). Do LDoN to get up your FT with augs and try to camp 2 bracers at BoT Tables.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Your mana pool is pretty small for 62 at 1685.  You should work on some +mana items.  Getting your epic would raise that by 100 mana.  Cultural armor would help you tremendously if you know anyone who makes it.  I don't really know what specifics to suggest to you.  All of them will probably cost you some wis, but wis above 200 isn't necessarily worth a decent amount of +mana on an item.  There is a formula on the cleric FAQ for how much mana you get per point of wis.  It's a good guideline to use when seeing if something is an upgrade for you.<br />

SCM will make a difference.  It's one of the absolute best AA's we have.<br />

<br />
Don't buff all your group with Virtue.. they don't all need it, if you group with the same people then buff them and watch how many times you actually need to heal each of them. If you didn't need to heal them from below 75% or so then they didn't really need Virtue, they probably just like having a nicer HP number up on screen.<br />
<br />
So, buff the enchanter and your tank if others start to get major agro stop and ask if they would like a virtue (i.e. letting the group know they are getting hit more than you thought they would and making it their fault you have to buff + med up). If there is a ranger/druid/pally in group they can buff these other people with their hp buffs anyway and can med while you do.<br />

Oof, now I'm confused. At this level, with capped wisdom, how much does each point of wisdom return to mana? I think I'm understanding that it's either 6 points of mana or 4. Anyone have a straight forward calculation to tell if the wisdom+mana from an item will be better than the straight wisdom item that I have? Like Wis * X + mana=mana</td>

Hehe being picky but I think Krigers hit for a max of 583 or so, not that they still can't drop a tank quick. For this reason on many tanks I start CH at 80%, unless they have good gear and AA's of course.<br />
<br />
I also disagree with not V'ing everyone. If it's a huge mana burden what you can do is space them out. If it's a pp burden just ask for a fair split of the loot, most groups are pretty reasonable.<br />
<br />
1. V yourself before you get to the camp.<br />
2. V the MT and slower when you get there, only 2k mana so you can start fighting right away.<br />
3. V the damage classes as you get full mana (ask for a 15 sec break due to cast time, unless your tank can survive 30+ sec easy without you).</td>

<br />
Regarding extended range vs extended enhancement, an extended range item is an important acquisition, especially as a raid cleric. Some mobs have AEs that reach the edge of normal CH range but no further. I've had SCRM for as long as I can remember, so I'm biased in saying ER is more valuable since there is no AA equivalent, but I would take the sword to the shield if I had to make a choice.

Yep, Wisdom at 255 or over is what I meant. So, if I wanted to buy an item with say, 6 wisdom and 30 mana, that would equal out to 60 mana total correct?<br />

Love the ring, sounds way more obtainable to me than the shield, but I'll work on both options. I'm finding the Underfoot Platemail (cultural armor) to be doable for me by the prices, as well as upgrade to my mana.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ah, the everburning question.<br />
<br />
I think it boils down to a few things.. besides what your focus is (getting to 65 or learning to use some neat new toys).  First, it's where you primarily play, or play to, what type of groups you end up playing in (pickups, friends, guild) and buffs you end up having.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know that sounds stupid, but let me explain.<br />
<br />
If you are an adventure nut, or plan to spend a lot of time in BoT, go for levels + gear.  They both get you more mana, which is a must.  No BoT group wants a cleric with 5 CH's worth of mana before he's OOM.  For adventures, the time limit (well, they are pretty easy now) kinda forces you to be buffed with mana regen, some FT and a good-sized mana pool.   If you spend a lot of time in other places, such as tier 1 planes, Luclin, etc.. then none of this is such a big deal and you can spend some time on AA.  Especially if you are sub 60 and spend time in Droga or Veksar (55ish), the AA xp is really nice.  At 65 AA goes slow in a lot of zones, the best probably being BoT or an all-65 adventure (this is provided you have no PoP flagging done).<br />
<br />
I mention groups, because playing with friends all the time is a totally different ball game than playing with strangers.  There are less expectations, they don't generally mind downtime here and there, and you can "afford" to work on AA if you prefer.  I wouldn't go nuts on AA though, maybe get your 6 general and 12 archetype, then hit the road to 65 though.  There's a few nice goodies to get if you have trouble getting gear (SCM helps, MC1 or 2, Celestial Regen, etc..) all those really help regardless of your mana pool/FT/gear.  I think I finished off SCM3 before i hit 65 because to me, it felt like a more logical choice.<br />
<br />
Raiding clerics : 65 > AA, there's no real dispute about that.  A few early AA can't hurt, but mana pool, plus spells and level really help.<br />
<br />
I mentioned buffs for a couple of reasons.  If you can always count on having KEI/VoQ (I do, I play 99% with my wife who is a 65 chanter), and AoZ or you play with a beasty/bard a lot, then mana regen/pool isn't as big of a deal.  You can get away with having a little less mana since you're getting it back a little faster.<br />
<br />
This is just from personal experience.. I found that i was very worried about being in BoT and my healing powers, especially when pulling kriegs and the mini's before 64ish.  You're also more likely to get into a group if you advertise "65 Cleric" ;)<br />
<br />
BTW, that set of cultural armor is great for the cost.  I still have a few pieces..  The AC is really nice, especially sub 60.  You can crack 1100 easily by 65 with just a full set alone and normal accessories.  <br />
<br />
Good luck..</td>

I'm going to go ahead and get some AAs in once I hit 63, as I'm still in tier 1 Planes and learning a bunch of stuff before I'll feel confident enough to take on anything higher. As I posted on another thread, it's time to enjoy the game, not fret over what I don't have, and not be in such a big fat hurry. I'll get there eventually. :D</td>
