<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello!  I was wondering if I might get some advice from you all...  First let me set up the scenario...<br />
<br />
Last night I was invited to join a group to go to Tower of Frozen Shadow.  I found out later that the group was comprised of RL family members that usually group together.  As you can imagine they are a tight group that has tons of experience together.<br />
<br />
The group was comprised of 2 Druids, 2 Warriors, a Necromancer, and myself (the Cleric).<br />
<br />
I could tell that the group was fairly used to having their Druids as their healers since they would rapidly start firing off heals every time the tanks would reach ~75% hps.  I stated that it was ok to let the tanks drop to ~60%hps since I could sup heal them and it would get them back into the 90% range.  Despite this, and me calling my heals, there was a lot of cross healing going on.  I only got to use Cheal once, and that was because a tank got lost and I was able to heal her though a wall.  (It was lucky here that the Druid was able to track the tank to a point where she was in range and got off a Gheal that gave me enough time to get my Cheal off, <i>that</i> was awesome!).  <br />
<br />
There <i>were</i> two deaths...  One tank was pulling and on the way back got killed, I ran off to heal her, but by the time she was in range she was a corpse already.  The other was the Necro, which had gained aggro from 2 Wizard mobs (a shadow) and was burned down before any of us could get a heal off.<br />
<br />
Now for my questions (sorry this has taken so long)...<br />
<br />
1) Have any of you been in a situation like that, where your healing powers were underestimated by those used to grouping with Druids/Shaman?  How did you deal with it?<br />
<br />
2) I know neither of the deaths were my fault, but I still felt quite bad.  All-in-all I've had a pretty good run with Merry, I can count the number of people that have died in a group with me on one hand.  Not to say none of those were <i>my</i> fault, I have made mistakes just like everyone else...  But I still felt really bad for those deaths...   How do you deal with feeling bad for those who die in your care?<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining about the group, I just want to make myself a better Cleric, and I want to be able to learn as much as I can from the experience last night.  :)  <br />
<br />
The trip to TOFS was VERY fun, the group was a great bunch of people that were very funny.  TOFS is also one of my favorite dungeons in EQ, so it was fun to be able to go back.  :)   One of the tanks and the Necro got the roll on that dagger that summons bandages, so they were very happy.<br />
<br />
I sent these questions to my guild's main Cleric, and he replied with some great advice.  I wanted to open it up to you all to see if you had any words of wisdom to offer.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">it used to bug me when my heals got covered by another class. but i look at it this way. i would of used that mana to heal them anyway. so even though we both healed the same person (both heals not needed) at same time. i still used same mana i would of used anyway (and they are wasting mana, not me). it is better to have a over healed tank, then a dead tank. you will find later in the game, the other healing classes WON'T heal when you wish they would, they are too busy doing other things. <br />
<br />
what i would of done in your situation, would be to ask that they make a key anouncing their heals. if they continued to heal over me, i would of just ignored it.<br />
<br />
i don't think they were underestimating you, i think maybe they were just used to playing without a cleric. so were not used to the power of complete heal.<br />
<br />
deaths will happen. i still take them personal. but that is what rez is for ;-). don't let them get to you too much!!!<br />

<br />
I was grouped without KEI so the cracked out druid was throwing wild heals in with the liberal dusting of carpet nukes he was dishing out.  I just let him go and when a tank got to where my heals were economic I'd use them.  In the end I just stopped announcing them, it was pointless.<br />
<br />
When I got to FM and the druid was still healing I pulled out my hammer and shield and waded into the fray.  I never let my eye off the health bars though.  Just went with the flow.  It wasn't pretty, efficient or organized but it was still fun.</td>

<br />
It all comes down to what sort of level you're at, and what kind of pulling your doing. :) (and what buffs you have, KEI anyone? /smilewink)<br />
<br />
As a cleric, your mana is best used to heal. Your nukes are pathetic when compared to a druid of the same level. By the same token, a druid's heals suck when compared to a cleric of the same level.<br />
<br />
So... I would have explained, polietly, to the druids that I have enough mana to keep <i>both</i> tanks healed, especially if one is assisting the other and not taunting. (Aggro control is very important at the high end game, and it's best to start learning early.) If the secondary tank had to offtank, you could have asked the druids to spot heal, but honestly their mana is best used at what they do best... dotting and nuking (and strangely enough, many druids resent filling the healer role because their nukes are pretty darned good). In some ways, your job is easier if the druids are nuking, because that means the mobs are dead sooner and in the long run do less damage to the tanks. If you did get low on mana, then the druids could step in and help with the heals... In a single group one cleric is more than enough to keep the main meleers healed.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As for dealing with deaths in your group, i still feel bad most of the time when i really do screw up and get someone killed, but at some point, you decide that if they or someone else causes it, its beyond your control. There are even times when its BETTER not to heal, or let them die. As im typing this, im in a key camping group in Ssra, where 3 of the 6 people died, and rather than heal and wipe us all out, i had to watch them fall over one by one. Frustrating and naturally upsetting to most of the clericy persuation, but then you remember, its just XP, and you can just res them and their mostly good as new =) Just say you're sorry and keep goin.. fighting to get the lost XP is more productive than sitting there feelin down about it =)</td>

When someone is helping, it throws me off. I did have a druid in my group the other day that was a little over-anxious at times, but I kinda appreciated it.<br />
<br />
People dying is s omething I just can't stand. Sometimes there's nothing you can do...monk dies pulling, enc being beat on while the tank needs a heal, the group is gonna wipe and you gotta stay clear and aggro-free. Sometimes it's just cause you mess up, and I lament my every mistake. I take it much harder than I should, and if I slip twice I usually ask the group to replace me. The absolute worst thing about playing a cleric is that when other classes mess up, people don't necessarily die.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In end game grouping with a tank that is actually a tank (keep in mind thats either in a top guild or 150 plus aa or both) a druid can actually fill my healer role.  It is actually better to have a druid because if the druid drops 1 dot per fight, epic perhaps, its more DPS than a cleric.  Plus they get regen, dmg shield, mana buffs, and nukes.</td>
