<br />
Apparently the name was petitioned. When the GM looked at my name he told me it was offensive and vulgar. I tried to politely point out my side of the argument but as soon as I spoke out the GM told me that if I argue with him he will put me on ignore and not help me out at all (he actually changed it to Savyra...which is just dumb, and I wanted it changed to Savya at the least). So I had no choice but to accept this decision and move on.<br />
<br />
Its unfortunate but I do realise that we play a game with many different people and cultures and I can see that someone may (obviously did) find it offensive.<br />
<br />
So, as soon as I can be bothered Ill change my signature and everything, if you have me on your friends list, please change my name to reflect the new name.</td>

Actually, I have seen and spoken to a character on my server by the name of Savyoass. Now he is about level 60 or 65 I think, yet his character was made after mine (I levelled slowly I guess).<br />
<br />
I mentioned to the GM that there is a character who is over 55 with that name...would he change it? The GM said that they dont change names of chars over 55 and then told me he would say no more on the subject.<br />
<br />
I dont want to get that guy into trouble, I just wanted to compare the differences. so the difference of 3 levels (even though I have 2 levels of AA points) means more than the fact that the character has been around a lot longer.<br />
/em shakes his head<br />
I just cant work it out....LOL Im sorry, I keep commenting here but I do want to lay it to rest, hehe. Ill stop now, not another word.</td>

I can understand changing a name, I guess... not necessarily agree with it, but I can understand that they have a naming policy which is enforced.<br />

But to change Savyrass and yet decline to change Savyoass because Savyrass is 52 and Savyoass is 55?  THAT is a major injustice.<br />

A friend of mine created a barbarian beastlord called Boobarian Breastlord.  She knew it wouldn't pass GM scrutiny, but it hasn't been changed to my knowledge because she's Australian and plays different hours to most GM's.<br />

<br />
That's because the GM/Guide that took your surname away actually just changed your surname to " " (a blank space). That way you MUST petition them to get the new surname. Most of the time someone has their surname taken away for the first time has it done this way or they drop some letters out of the surname just to change it so that is "complies with the naming policy". This is done so that you are forced to /petition for the name change and that way a GM/Guide is actually approving your new surname.<br />
<br />
A guy I know who was in the first guild I was in has had every one of his toons names changed. He's even had a surname changed on the same toon 3 times, and the second and third names he chose were previously approved by other guides/GM's. He has caught the attention of SOE because the last time he rolled a new toon, the name was changed in the time it took to roll the new toon and go from the character select screen to logging in the game.

Another guy I know had his name, Darktoker Dasmoka changed because of the drug reference. They dropped the surname to a blank space and took the "K" out of the name to make it Darktoer. He petitioned and got the name changed to Darksyde (I forget what surname but you get the point). Funny thing is there is another toon on the same server with the name Madtoker. Madtoker's surname also has a drug reference but for the life of me I cannot remember it. It's blatantly more obvious though then Darktoker, yet remains untouched.</td>

Funny name side note, my Gnome necro was reported for the offensive name Vermyn Pusbubble. When the GM showed up he just laughed and complimented me on "an excellent surname for a Betoxxulous worshiping Gnome."</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, I do agree with you to an extent Gymp. But why 55? As I mentioned earlier I would likely have more contacts, friends, reptuation, etc on my level 52 that Ive played for over a year than on a level 55 that has only been played for 3 months.<br />
Not only that but add to it AA points. If I am level 53 with 3 AA points (which Im not, but just humour me) then why would I be more susceptible to the naming standards than a level 55? Surely Ive put in just as much work, Ive just taken a different path.<br />
While we are on it. What difference is there between level 54 (or level 52 and 2AA) and level 55?<br />
<br />
Sorry, AFAIC it should be all or nothing.<br />
<br />
Ive still yet to hear anyone say that they find the word ASS offensive...or even the phrase Save your ass.<br />

BTW I now have the email address of GM Ornklo of the Zebuxoruk server. If you have any issues on that server please let me know, Ill be happy to pass his email onto you :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Sav, until I looked at your name carefully, I always thought it was short for "Savoury ass," which carries a much different connotation from "Save your ass."<br />
<br />
If the 'ass' part of your name was the problem, maybe you could have asked to just have an E added to the end of your name? Savyrasse still pronounces the same, but it's not quite as blatant. However, there is also the issue of your name representing a phrase, especially one of more than two words. Surnames like Flamecaller, Stormwind, etc. are passe, (these have a named I can't remember,) but anything else is technically against the rules.<br />
<br />

Funny story: I once met a cleric in Lower Guk, who was obviously a wife learning the game, playing with her husband, a 60 paladin in the (then) second-highest guild on the server. I berated her choice of name at the time, but forgot about the incident. Many months later, I apply to the paladin's guild, and first time we're grouped on the raid, he mentions the incident. I had forgotten completely, but she's still playing by his side, without a surname.<br />
<br />
I wasn't responsible for the loss of her name, but for some reason I flipped out that night over the surname "Itsjustagame". I carried on that I would never want to group with a cleric named that because they obviously weren't terribly concerned about their success. I may have had a point, but I was out-of-line that night...I was talking to her the other night and it comes up in conversation, and I mention that it made me a tad bit nervous about my app. She said to me, 'Well, I wasn't going to bring it up. I just sorta laughed at the argument being presented to me from someone named Rest and Relaxation."</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">There is no lvl 55 "limit" listed in the naming policy, and as such the GM/Guide was probably using that for their own barometer for changing names. I guarantee you if someone got away with a name that was blatantly offensive and leveled all the way up to level 65, the name would still get changed. In fact, I was contacted by a guide once regarding my ranger's name, Miffas. Someone had supposedly taken offense to the "ass" with one S missing at the end. I told the guide that they were going to have to fix their random name generator then, because that is exactly where the name came from, and he "let me" keep it.</td>

Personally, I think the naming convention rules are too arbitrary and GM discretion can be a power trip for some. The problem is there will always be griefers,  whether its someone who tries a name to see how long it will last (IE: Maxxi Padd) to some rival guild/person who wants some sort of revenge. I just wished SOE was more consistient in how they enforce the naming rules. I mean come on, how many RanJahz have some phonetic variant of Legolas or Aragorn (especially now that LotR is all the rage.)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Restandre, yes adding an 'e' would keep the name pretty similar, but my biggest beef was still with all the hassle of changing all my files and everything and that would have to happen anyway, as well as the fact that it STILL is not offensive, LOL, it just isnt. Savoury Ass? LOL ok, so you got the r and the y mixed up, why should I get in trouble for that?<br />
The phrase policy is still in existance, yes. But its not adhered to anymore and if they did decide to start following that rule again, then half the server would have to get a name change.<br />
<br />
Kamiff. No there may not be a level 55 limit in the naming policy. But I have been a guide and I know that EVERY guides set of rules and regs list that limit for name changes. I wasnt going to mention that I had worked in the program before since it adds a new dimension to the argument that I didnt think needed to be here. I cant remember if it was in the EQ handbook, or the server handbook that I was given to memorise, but there was definately a level limit for changing names. I dont know if a GM has ever changed a name above that limit or not, but I would suggest that going by thier own 'handbooks' given out to guides that it would not be a simple thing to do.<br />
Even as a guide there was only one name that I raised with a GM as needing changing and it was something like "imgnafkuup" or something similar. <br />
<br />
Remember, above all else, that my last name was not only approved by a GM, but it was typed in for my by a GM. You have to petition to get a last name like Whe'Nimgudnredy, you cant put that in yourself, only a GM can do that. So a GM had seen and approved my first name as well (and had seen the phrase that it makes).</td>
