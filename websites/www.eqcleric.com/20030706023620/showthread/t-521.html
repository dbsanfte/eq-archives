I am lvl 55 and had a lvl 56 druid with me to help, and I'm glad I did.  It's not that the goblins themselves are so hard, but they heal each other as you're trying to kill them, even if you've only aggroed one.  <br />
<br />
/no <br />
<br />
But,<br />
It may be possible if you able to either slaughter all the gobbies down below first (the healing offenders) or if you drag each one away from the tower to kill it.  Either way you go, it's gonna be tricky and somewhat dangerous.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide to do, good luck!  Begurgle (or whatever his name is) is a real chump and should go down pretty easy.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Yes, you could theoretically use a monk. I'm not sure on respawn rates on the gobbos though. They have alot of hit points and you get interrupted while casting spells underwater alot more easily than if you are on land. A fellow cleric friend of mine was camping Begurgle already and invited me to come and join her. I went LD about 10 times along the way and finally got there shortly before Begurgle popped. I was lucky, he popped about 3 times while I was there. I went and handed in the item the next day and a lvl 54 wizzie and I killed the flame thing by ourselves. Oh, if you hit the guy before Natasha kills him and stand really close to where he dies, the flame will pop and aggro on you. So long as it does not aggro Natasha Whitewater, she will not attack it. So I got the aggro and my wizzie friend nuked it.<br />
The plasmatic priest was pretty easy. I had some high level friends who joined me. They cast SoE on me so I could float and run really fast. I pulled him to the zone and we killed him fast.<br />
Lord Grimblox was a royal pain though. If you think 6 hours waiting for Begurgle was bad, I camped Lord Grimblox for 26 hours straight before he popped. It was a nightmare. I had just given up and was starting to gate (I literally was casting the spell and waiting to zone) when he popped. I aborted gate just in time and proceded to kick his tail. (ok, technically at that point I had nearly passed out on the couch and my mother was sitting at my keyboard-- I told her to gate and she was the one who aborted for me). Btw, you can solo the whole room at lvl 54 if you break the spawn. For awhile I had help.<br />
I'm still trying to get things organized for the chardok part. I tried twice but both times people going LD or just not showing up sort of ruined my chances of getting to Bathezid. I'm hoping to schedule a massive raid sometime to get the overking.<br />
Good luck on the waiting game for the mobs!<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Regarding Bergugle, I was one of the lucky ones...only killed a single placeholder. I did the PH solo - didnt' want to tie up someone else for the camp, as you mentioned .... lulled the placeholder and single-pulled him to the wall underwater (north wall in my case) to kill him....my back against the wall to help avoid interruptions. You are far enough away at that wall to avoid heals from his friends.<br />
<br />
When Bergugle himself popped, I called down some help from a druid and a paladin. Did the same lull single-pull to the wall, and pally and I chain stunned him while pally and druid wasted him...fairly easy.<br />
<br />
You definitely don't want to fight him or his PH in-place at the tower...the others will heal and attack. Also, make sure you are only killing the center spawn (near Deep, the dark elf mob) as this is the only PH. I believe the other one or two in the tower are PH's for the druid epic mob...you don't need them for your pop.<br />
<br />
As for EB, I do not have an EB item, but my necro friend gave me a fairly long-lasting Dead-Man-Floating which has EB (lasts about 2-1/2 hours I believe), good for a few PH's.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you! (I'm currently needing the Lord Gimblox....camped him a couple hours for a few sittings...I'm too impatient for more than that....oh well, someday).</td>

If you can get an enchanter with project illsusion to cast air elemental on you you won't need EB as its in the illusion and the at the time the goblins didn't assist each other if you were in some form of illusion such as elemental or wolf.<br />

This guy can be taken down with a group of low to mid-50's easily. I did mine with 4 people, none above level 55, at the time. (Had Myself, SK, Warrior, Enchanter) <br />
<br />
Granted, my info is a little dated. 4 expansions and a whole host of character improvements have come and gone since I did mine, so I can only assume it would be even easier now.</td>

I petitioned it and the guide said he could not do anything and Would elavate it. Camped LB for 14 Straight Hours And Killed the Spirit again While waiting on the Elevate to get aswered Did my turn ins and Such. Lofgged in the next day And had a begurgle crown in inventory :( Wife was pissed.<br />

Be real Careful about Nat when you get the Spirit of Flame to keep her from KSing You. You may not get as lucky as I did because I have been told that I got lucky by someone else that had it happen to them.</td>

And there was no way in heck I could do it alone between lack of EB and fighting underwater. I was level 55 and still could not do it by myself. I'd advise getting at least one friend to come help. :(</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I found a way to prevent Natasha from KSing. One method that I heard of was to root her to keep her away (and then atone later). But I didn't have to do that. Just before the guy (can't remember his name right now) was about to die while Nat was killing him, I moved in close and smacked him a few times. I was right over him when the spirit spawned and the first thing it did was turn and hit me. If Natasha is closer it will attack her. When she is not attacked, she will not aggro on the spirit. So the spirit started hitting me, I hit back, and my lvl 54 wizzie friend nuked him to hell. Fight lasted maybe 5 seconds.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, after 7 hours of camping him, Lord Begurgle spawned. WIth the help of the little 43 Bard I was PLing, we wasted him fairly easily. Pretty much as soon as I looted the crown, a druid friend sent tell that he was gonna come camp him with me and try to get the corrupted to spawn. So he helped me kill Shemdrk and the spirit (Natasha never blinked). After getting the coral statue, grabbed a couple of meat shields and Killed Plasmatic Priest and got Bloody Robe. Woohoo. I have never been so nervous as when I gave that coral statue to A Seeker not know for sure I was on the right one. I dragged him to entrance and we slaughtered him... <br />

Now need to get a group together for Ixblat, cause I have Gimblox Signet Ring already too.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The seeker I needed wasn't up when I went there. I had to wait about 20 min to half an hour realtime. So I just practiced the run from his room to the entrance over and over and over until I was confident that I could navigate without getting lost or stuck. I had some high level tanks and a druid waiting for me at the entrance. They made sure the huge double doors were open for me when I ran back so I didn't slam into them or have to get stuck on them. I was so nervous when I handed the statue in bc I thought I was gonna get smacked down. I started the trade and turned around so I was facing the door, clicked GIVE and then ran like hell. I made it to the entrance pretty quickly with no wrong turns or confusion. Then my party proceeded to beat the crap out of the plasmatic priest. He died fast. :-)<br />
What server are you on? If you're on Tribunal I might be able to help with Ixi. :-)<br />

Yes this will cause you to have to wait for another Shemdrk to spawn. But Id rather wait another 3 hours for him to spawn then to have to camp another Lord B crown.</td>

But whatever works for you is good. :-)<br />
