<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In answer to the original question:-  It's okay for a cleric to melee if that's the most useful thing you could be doing.  As a general rule, that only happens between levels 1 and 20, and after level 56; between 21 and 55, you should be medding full-time, and if you have any spare mana left over, nuke!<br />
<br />
A lot of clerics in their 60's melee with our summoned hammer.  But personally, I don't melee much any more.<br />
<br />
The reason for that is that of everyone in the group, I do the least damage.  That means that I'm the member of the group who can most easily be spared to go and pull while the rest of the group is finishing off the monster.  If I can spare time and mana, I tend to nuke rather than meleeing.<br />
<br />
So in LDoN, I'm not a tanking cleric, I'm a pulling wizzicleric.</td>

Me?<br />
I melee all the time, unless my mana drops below 75% or if all hell is breaking loose...<br />
I especially enjoy meleeing versus undead, proc hammer proc! Whoopee, another one fades to dust.<br />
I'd rather melee than nuke, it's my own little thing.. I have a bad habit of chatting when I'm stuck medding, and getting into the thick of things ensures I am far too busy to fall into idle banter. More people have died to me being engrossed in chat, than me being absorbed in melee. I also enjoy pulling when I get the chance.<br />
Just don't get sucked into watching how much damage you do, it's meager and humbling until we get the proccing hammer. But even then, don't get hypnotized by watching to see if you proc. We do not do uber melee damage compared to "true melee" classes. But every DPS counts in the end, be it nuking or melee.<br />
Don't let people discourage you either. Once you set the right technique, a meleeing cleric is not a liability. A Cleric's primary function is to heal. If you are healing fine, then doing other things like pulling, or meleeing, nuking, or even mocking the mobs can be an awesome luxury that alleviates some of the tedium that can stem from medding all the time.<br />

I've consitiently melee'd throughout my cleric career, as long as I was above 70-75%m. Yes I'm the lowest DPS but any DPS is better than none.  Some argue its better to med and nuke than melee but I like getting my hands dirty in battle, it seems more appropriate to the character.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've found myself melee'ing a lot in LDoN, especially in MM :D  No point sitting there when I'm usually only doing a HoT or so on each pull, and sitting on FM (depending on how well the group works together of course).  Why not whip out my 62 hammer and hit yaulp, throw out a bit more dps.  Especially since I've had several times when 15-20 secs meant the difference between a win and loss.  If something goes wrong and I have to dump a little mana, than I just med a bit till I'm at a comfortable level again.  With the dungeon crawl that ldon is, you can't just sit there, stand, heal, sit back down, you're constantly moving.  So it's almost natural to at least take a few swipes.  It all comes down to "are you having mana trouble, or are you usually between 85-fm"?  <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">You should not melee under the following situations:<br />
1) Your group is requiring your full medical attention. (The usual reason - that is why you're there.)<br />
2) You're medding back from something that dropped you low. (Lots of buffs, nuked a little too much, crisis healing)<br />
3) You're getting in the way. (Blocking rangers and rogues, you can't fit around 5 beastlords with their pets)<br />
4) You'd rather be nuking. (Out of desire or usefulness)<br />
5) You feel you would be more useful pulling.<br />
6) Misc. other things occupying your attention. (Tells and RL distractions, playing ghetto CC)<br />
7) You conclude that your meleeing is useless. (Don't let this get you down.)<br />
<br />
Any other time you should melee if you are so inclined. If you are of the belief that you should nuke instead, then you REALLY should be meleeing unless you're feeling lazy. If you're nuking, you obviously have mana to burn and are focused on damage output, so why not stand next to the mob to do it and swing while waiting for your nuke to recycle? If I'm dealing with a mob that requires a spell interrupt, I'll always get near it, and sometimes melee while waiting for the "A Vann Geistlig begins to cast the gate spell."<br />

Often I will get tired of meleeing after a while and stop, but I think it's fun for a change, especially during the times when you "aren't useful" as a melee class. I used to always be a butt-caster. For 60 levels I was. Now I melee when I have an excuse.</td>

Really though, if your group is killing mobs that may require you to cast one or two heals per fight, why not get up there and add our "UBER" dps  to the mix? &#123;beat}</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think it's important for clerics to melee early in their careers, if nothing else but to build their defense skill. I meleed through my 20s and was even doing a little tanking in my 30s. When I have the opportunity (usually only with guild groups and when FM) I still like to melee on occasion. As a result, my 1HB is maxxed and my defense and offense are nearly maxxed. It has served me well when working on my epic.<br />
<br />
I have talked about this on these boards before, but I stopped playing a 37 cleric whose melee skills were so poor that her 1HB, defense, and offense were all below 20. As a result she was pretty much helpless if she got aggro. That is not the case with me; if I am getting beat on I am quite able to take some hits and wait patiently for a peel, which is much better than running around and making the tanks chase you around.<br />

Your job is a healer.  Do that first, then worry about anything else, and you'll be fine.  If no one is dead, and your progressing through whatever your objective; raid target, exp, or adventure, then everything and anything else is a bonus.<br />

this was when i was fom, everyone was full on health, and it was a single pull.  i only fight on (full or almost full mana) single pulls, when there's another cleric to heal, or in emergencies when we are trapped and i'm oom.  i sit back down as soon as my mana drops below 90, always.  i thought i was being smart, using these healthy happy pulls to increase my melee skills.  but, to my dismay...this warrior comes along (who supposedly has a cleric main) and gives me a lecture.<br />

Heh, gotta love those idiots. He may very well have a cleric...and bought into that tripe.<br />
<br />
We can melee just fine, and still heal the group (in many, not all, situations). The trick is learning when you can and when you can't.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that our melee skills are our strong suit...obviously, a melee class can and should do it better. <br />
<br />
But even without level 56 and it's nifty hammer, we can contribute just fine to DPS. My cleric is about equal to my shaman in melee damage...of course, the shaman has the pet and the slows\hastes\uber buffs, so overall he is better...<br />
<br />
A non fighting cleric is a broken cleric (IMNSHO)...your defensive skills don't get raised and you will be in a world of pain if you need to fight to survive.<br />
<br />
Healing comes first, yes. But you can still get in and swing away. Or sit back and nuke, if you prefer (though as someone already said, if you are so mana heavy you can nuke, you should also be standing and swinging between casts)<br />
<br />
Remember, slowers are your best friends...they cut down how much mana you have to use for heals. That gives you more time to return the hurt'n favor to the mobs.<br />
<br />
Of course, as Shadowfrost said...you may want to do pulling instead or as well.<br />
<br />
In my normal Dulak group, my shaman sits on his but and casts\sends in Old Yeller, I pull and heal and melee for 10 seconds at a time. Anyone else with us tanks and destroys anything I bring home to play with. Once you know the area, you will be able to pull just fine without having to worry about someone dying while you are gone. It's also a lot of fun.</td>

I dont let either of them heal me unless I get below 40% in combat, as I can self heal after fight, leaving them with more mana to produce DPS.  When i am partnered with either of them, We can keep either Stormwave, or Lady D cleaned without either of us running too low on mana.  If I take time to nuke, I end up running low on mana, then have to med between fights, causing slower pulls.<br />

The main thing about swinging your hammer is that you always have to remember what your job is. If the group stays alive, swing your hammer all you want. However, if anyone in the group ends up dying and they have noticed you meleeing, you will get the blame for the death because that's your number one job. My melee skills are all maxed but if I have the slightest hint that there's a good chance of a surprise healing needed I will stop meleeing and sit on my butt. I could never live with myself if I was meleeing and someone ended up dying.</td>

I melee & nuke, if I'm in a normal group, but it's rare that I am ever in a normal group ;) It also depends on the weapon your'e using, your mana, and the health of your group. Not to mention, as your bash skill goes up, your bashing can help in keeping a gating mob or healing mob from getting their last spells in.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">At level 65 w/ the summoned hammer I do about 20-40 DPS.  You can probably accomplish the same amount of damage with a couple nukes, though w/ melee you gain mana rather than spend it.  Regardless of which way you choose to deal your damage, if you're not having problems with mana you should by all means contribute some damage.  Just tell the loud-mouthed warrior or whomever that you're at 90+ mana so there's little point to medding.<br />
