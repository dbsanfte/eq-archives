<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ahh yes, money and rez, they go hand in hand. I don't know how it is on other servers but something is rotten on ECI. Hello I'm Valadon, a level 56 Templar of ECI, I do around 20 rezzes a week (depending on raids, and such) and I do not charge money. I do not ask for money from anyone, be it a guild mate or a stranger, but something bothers me as of late. People all over are starting to give less and less respect for the art of rezzing. I remember what seems like years ago when the conversation for rezzing was "Pardon me sir/ma'am but could I bother you to spare a rez? I'm willing to pay." "Sure." Rez. "There you go." "Thank you here is 5 platinum." God how I loved that. Now its a bit different. "hey u rez me" "Okay.." Rez "thx later" Sadly thats one of the better ones I've seen as of late >_<<br />
<br />
It's come from people begging for rezzes to people demanding rezzes! Why I can name 6 people off hand who never even said thanks or thx or plz or please. Don't get me wrong. I don't need to be paid, but being offered a tiny bit would be really great every now and then. What am I saying? Even a constant flow of thanks for my rezzes would be wonderful. I pray that its not like this on any other servers, if it is maybe...System wide rez protest? Hehe well thats my rant for the month. I feel a lot better. Take care<br />

I have in fact rudely refused a rez depending on the initial approach from a person needing a rez. Even gone as far as to reply 'sure, it'll cost ya 100pp'. Rude question warrants a rude reply.<br />

I have yet to reach lvl 14 as of yet.  Since this character will be my main one I am sure I will get my fair share of this treatment.<br />
<br />
I am alreadya smart ass in real life as well as a very nice individual.  I deal with customer's everyday.  To be exact I handle customer's over a telephone and or email/Chat program which makes it very difficult because like a video game all they see is your typing and or voice.<br />
<br />
I for one will heavily instate the "rude approach rude reply" program.  Courtesy will get you a free rez without a reply for donations...not even a peep.<br />
<br />
A rude response will get you either one of these if not multiples...<br />
<br />
1. no response at all<br />
2. it will cost ya's<br />
3. smart ass reply..."oh so you expect me to drop what I am doing to cater to you heh?"<br />
4. my favorite to cater to that "I r0xx0r j00 b0XX0r, l3wt d00d pl4y4"..."Me no speeka da engrish" :D <br />
<br />
I do not look forward to be a prick but I shall relish in the moments when prompted to do so.  Heck, I make some coin in the process.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">This is an age old EQ debate. I have been playing this game since it's inception and this is the way it has been from the beginning. (well ever since people have been high enough to rez/port etc.)<br />
<br />
I have had the pleasure of leveling a drood before I decided that  it was not enough of a torture that I decided to level a cleric. My response to the rude people has always been the same be it drood/chanter/cleric or whatever..... and that is ... nothing....then when they continue,  it is ...  /ignore.<br />
<br />
I have come to the conclusion that I play this game to have fun, and I am not going to let a few freaks spoil a game for me. For the most part people tend to be pretty nice about asking for rezes ports and what not, the ones that are not, do not warrant my attention, be it negative or positive.<br />
<br />
All the time  I get people dragging their body to me and say "here click this". My attitude is " my stick is broke... for some reason it doesn't work on jerks" It would be easy for me to just right click my clicky stick and rez them. doesn't cost me any mana and only takes 10 seconds of my time. But like I said if they cant be civil to me, then I have no interest in them. Thus I have no time, not even 10 seconds.</td>

I sat there in a bit of bewilderment, ultimatly deciding I wasnt going. Why should I have to drop what I'm doing, go 3 zones away, then have to hike back and try to fight for my camp? The guy later started sending me tells and shouting zonewide "Ganeiel is a fag, he would cum rez me. Now I have to werk hard again" most people just laughed, and his retort is common with all "dewds"  ..... STFU. Some people have alot of nerve..and some are way to greedy. I think what happened is awhile back we had all the nice players...but now there 60 and bored, so they quit, and we're left with pre-puebescent boys and what not...Not that theres anything wrong with that I guess, im only 15 (as of tommorow, DING! 15!)

But when you rez them and get nothing it just dosen't seem polite.  Sure it'll take me 10mins to meditate to regain the mana but I did a good deed.  Good rep is great for a cleric.  But i think whats worse is when they want buffs after rez, there where you tell them off by casting Donal's Armor buff...  haha  Anyways I'll keep rezing for donations beacuse i'm just a nice person.  Death sucks no matter what class you are.<br />

If I am asked nicely I will always refuse a donation. BUT  I often get this "hey I need a res in <zone>"  Then I say "Hey its going to cost you 300pp"  In other words get the hint, it isn't going to happen.  If someone says "Where are you, I need a res" I say "If you can find me I will res you" (as I run around and hide behind trees)  I don't take plz and ty or thx for please or thanks,  if they want a res so bad they can say thank you and please.  Its not hard at all.  And I NEVER say anytime after someone says thanks for a res, unless it is a friend because people have actually put me on their friend list to be ressed agian.  I also don't go out of my way to res a wizard or druid because these days they won't port you half the time if you only donate 20pp for the port.  Well that is just my two cp.  Feel free to try them out :)<br />

Now I assume he was desperately late for a VT raid or something, but if someone gave me 5p for a rez or didn't offer to donate I would add them to the list.  Commonly people donate, and I say donate meaning I do not have to ask, 100pp for a 96% rez.  It was typically 50pp for the 90% rezzes, and there is no way I am going to blow 20 min and 600 mana rezzing for nothing, much less someone who is rude.  My exp and my groups well being will not be compromised for a mere pittance.  Now if I am sitting around bored or doing nothing it is a different story, but it happens to me every other week or so, that sitting LFG I get offered 300pp + to go to a zone 3 zones over and do a rez.  My general rule is 50pp Rez and heal, 100pp+ rez and Aego, and rude = /ignore.  It takes quite a bit of time and mana to do a rez, time and mana I could be spending improving my character, if some poor fool wants to enlist the help of a 96% rezzer to save him 5 - 10 hrs of exping... he certainly had better show some appreciation.</td>

If I'm grouped, I split the rez proceeds with the group for one reason, they're waiting on me to regain 700 mana that could be put to use for other things, like healing the tank and exping. As far as running for rezzes, I don't run clear out to BFE Norrath anymore just to rez someone unless A ) They're paying considerably or B) Good friend of mine providing the port. One lvl 35 Rogue put an end to me running anywhere to rez someone. I was in East Commonlands watching the auctions go by and I get a tell saying Hey can you rez me plz I died 5 times. I was like well okay ( thinking to myself well I don't have anything better to do cept watch the spam ). Anyways I run down to Oasis. Yup, 3 zones away. I get down to Oasis and he's like my corpses are down by the tower. At this point I was thinking to myself Gee what a moron, you'd think at 2 deaths a person would stop trying to hunt them. I pull the first up on the bank, the second, the third, the fourth, and I find the 5th within a stone's throw of two deepwater aqua goblins. Luckily I didn't aggro them. I start rezzing him and 5 rezzes later he hands me 14 p!#@$ 14 PLAT. I mean if it was a newbie and he gave me 14 p I'd still be a little irked for running that far for pittance pay, but this guy had half Mrylokar ( Rogue click ) Armor on. He just shrugs at me and goes Sorry all I got. These are the kind of folk that make our lives hell. People wonder why we won't run 3 zones for a rez, ^^ thats why. I could have made 14p in less amount of time going and killing off the newbie guards and selling off their fs crap weapons.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ok heres my concern on this rant...<br />
To start off I'm not greedy or a loot hog - the games no fun if you are but at the same time we clerics do need funding to advance - our items get pretty pricey the higher you go (the selleable ones) and our spells - well thats a whole other ball of wax altogether!!  When I first created my cleric was when getting 20 was a BIG milestone, and it wasn't easy - neither was getting all the heals and then the resses...long story short - for a cleric you are NEVER there until you hit 60.  My one goal was to become a resser. Man the money would flow then!  I mean really it's hard work to get XP - takes hours of time and effort and when you lose that time WOW would you EVER be grateful to the guy that gave that time back to you!  Well I got my levels and climbed in ability and found out that lost time isn't that valuable after all.  Druids and wizards make fat cash from ports and enchanters get HUGE money from clarity - yet us clerics toss out our time for FREE or little or no money so that others can get THEIR time back from bad pulls or other poor reasons.  rarely do you see a cleric auctioning or OOC'ing in a zone 'ressin for donations! PST drag to me or I'll come to you for extra plat!' and even if we do how much are we makin? 5pp? meanwhile druids are doin p[orts of 6 at a time and makin 60+pp a trip and enchanters are gettin 30 to 100pp per person for KEI!  When was the last time you sat in the nexus and Aego'd people to pay off yer spell purchase of 20k to 40k??  WE CLERICS GIVE RESSES AWAY FOR FREE!! We did it to ourselves!! Back when I was among the 1% of tribunal clerics resses were goin for 300pp to 1kpp a POP!!  Now we're lucky if we get 3pp??  Are we BEGGARS???  The ressie NEEDS the ressor!! We provide a service - you life BACK!  I remember reading a paperback novel where some jids got caught in a roleplaying game and they had to get past the dragon to get home - one kid died doing it and they got home but had to come back to visit the clerics guild to get him ressed - it cost them in alot more than just money - they had to change themselves and the paths of their lives.  Life doesn't come cheap, it's about time we stopped selling oursleves short and charged a modest fee for our services.  I don't know about you but I always pay well whether it's expected, asked or demanded of me.  In return I want to be treated the same - 96% XP return is most of the time HOURS even DAYS and WEEKS of play - I demand courtesy when asked and recompense when I deliver that TIME back.  We need to get together and determine a server-wide RATE for resses - cause as it is we get walked all over. Nothing crazy but in my opinion anything from 1 to 2pp for each percent of XP returned is MORE than fair from people that have K and K and more K in the bank.  Be free to your guild, be free to CLOSE friends, but charge people that you dont know well and charge em DOUBLE if you dont like em.  If we get together and do this we might get some respect back. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I agree with Elashanti. I mean come on, you have druids who won't even port certain places unless they get 20-100pp. You have Chanters who hardly ever give away free KEI and when they do its between 50-100pp. I'm also not a greedy person, but spells and gems can kill you in the long run. No one really needs a port they do it cause they don;t want to take a boat or run half way across a continent. No one really needs KEI they just get it cause they don;t wanna wait for their mana to regen slowly and they could use the extra bit of INT or WIS. Although people DO need life, yet we give them to people cause we are the nice ones in Norrath. I don;t demand donations but it is nice for them to. Maybe now I should make it known donations of a decent amount are welcome. When i get to 49 i know i don;t want to run around rezzing people giving them back 90% of their life back for free. We really should discuss a decent rate, and let it be known to people on the servers that we have a going rate now and we won;t settle for being Norraths door mats any longer. :)</td>

Almost everytime they respond with an amount they are willing to pay. if i feel the amount is worth the time i agree or tell em "sorry, not worth my time." <br />
<br />
I got to this point because over my trip from level 1 to 53, i never got a free port from a druid/wiz (excluding group/guild) when i was needy. And back when i used to answer other peoples /ooc looking for rez, over half of the people told me no sorry i can't accept that %. Well kiss it bud you are now on /ignore (now i got a paper list since i filled /ignore).<br />
 Even worse, on a minor kael raid i was the highest level cleric (level 52 at the time) when the puller srews the pooch and gets himself killed. they drag the corpse back and since i cast a rez without even thinking/asking. the dude has the balls to say in the chat channel. "Sorry i can't accept only a 90%. I have a clickstick on another account camped back at the zone line. someone evac back and run him in invis."....<br />
This jerk stopped the entire raid for 45 minutes because he wouldn't 'accept' a 90% rez. needless to say i tipped my hat to the raid organizer and gated back to the nexus. I later found out the raid busted shortly there after becuse the remaining 2 clerics couldn't hold it together..</td>

I've *always been extremely grateful for any rez I've gotten.  Being a newbie cleric, I hope I don't run into a lot of this stuff.<br />
<br />
However, I've got an opinion about "donations."  If you expect a donation, or ask for a donation, it is no longer a donation.  It is now a fee.  If you desire or expect a certain amount of platinum pieces for your services (which are certainly deserved) then don't beat around the bush about it!  If you expect at least 25pp (or whatever) to do a rez,  ask for it.  Otherwise, you'll have to just accept what you get - and if you honestly aren't happy with it, then you shouldn't rez for "donations."  There's nothing wrong with wanting to do things a certain way and speaking out about them! :)<br />
<br />
Besides, there are far too many people with no idea of respect at all to have to rely on them to know how to treat their wonderful clerics.<br />

<br />
The thing that is making me think more about this is that on most if not all servers it is the general perception that if you want a port then you pay, if you want clarity then you pay, if you need a Res you 'donate'.<br />
<br />
Now this MAY be due to the fact that traditionally the Cleric class attracts a large number of people who wouldn't think twice about charging for a res.<br />
<br />
Whatever the reason Sornae is right about the fact that we as Clerics should demand payment if that is what we want, in the same way Druids demand payment for TP's. I long ago gave up shouting 'Donating for a TP to XXXX' as I am not donating, I am paying.<br />
<br />
At level 43 I don't get many non Guild requests for resses so I have to admit that I haven't had much experience of this sort of thing. No doubt that will change when I get to 49. At the moment I will request a payment if a stranger asks for a res providing I am free to perform it.</td>

I was thinkings would be a good idea till you hit maybe 49. You could charge 1 pp per percent. Such as 10% = 10pp rez. or 75%= 75pp for rez. I think that would be an easy price for most people away to remember. Now where we shoutld hit is Supply and demand. 90% and higher..Since I dont know what people donate for these (since i just got my 90% rez) I would think maybe 100-150? I have no idea what a 96% rez goes for either but the one I had I did give up a good chunk of change. Now I have a roomate who plays a druid and she often asks me what to pay on rezzes for now on ill go witht he % formula.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In response to Sornae, we don't expect donations for the most part if we're not busy and such, but if we're busy and they need a rez, they better be forking over the cash. I'm sorry, but leaving my camp because a melee thought he could do without the support classes that were lfg 30 mins ago and are still lfg, the melee can pay for his stupidity. As for gems and spells, it's not so bad at low levels, but when you hit Naltron, Marzin, and Aegolism, folks better be forking up the cash or gems to pay for it. When you fork up 2-3k at the vendor for a 10 slot backpack of peridots, it tends to drop the bank account quick. Usually, notice I said usually, and on most occasions, Sebilis and Velks groups have no beef paying the cleric for gems. I hit everyone with Heroic Bond, Shield of Words, and Symbol of Naltron. Although costly, it proves to be worth it. As far as Dreadlands goes, if you're in your 40's, ask the group for the first three decent loots(from that zone:weighted axe, axe of iron back,etc). Karnors, Karnors sucks, people give you jack for respect and corpses are plentiful. Karnors is not worth the time, gems, exp, or the possibility of you getting wiped by some moron's train. When you hit 49-51, goto Velks or Seb, it's worth your time and money. Unless you want the Kunark class armor or some specific piece from Karnors, steer clear of it. Chardok, BYOG=Bring your own group. Whew, think I'm done, lol.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">i live in Velks alot lately on Prexus... and well.. people fall and 10k alot.  castle trained alot as well.. sometimes i log on just in time to see the devestation of the train. oh my the corpses.  As soon as they see me it's like Mzry.. can you rez me and my friend and .. then this person and that... i've rezzed for 30 min and not gotten 1p or one thank you.  It has now become expected.  If you are a cleric around any corpse with a stick in your hand it is your duty to click them and walk away.  I remember being offfered monies.. i'd usually cancel trade.  I do expect some kind of donation if i need to travel from my zone to rez.. and if i'm in the middle of a group and it's making them wait because i have to rez.. a donation to split among my group is as well accepted.. but please.... i'm normally quite nice and click away, but i think i'm becoming bitter about it and fed up.  i'm just gonna stay on AFK and leave my message as "UMmmmmm.. NO... rot !!"<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've never asked for money with my rezzes, nor has my wizard ever asked for money with TL/Ports.  However, if I'm in a group then I will tell the person that I'm unable to help them since I'm in a group...most of the time.  There have been ocasions where I've rezzed someone whilst in a group, but only if my group leader is ok with it and if I'm the leader, then I won't do it at all.  No matter what, I've never asked for anything... but I gladly accept donations :-)  What I don't like is when someone makes me run all over the zone for them and then doesn't offer a donation - even though I don't charge, if I have to work alot for them, they should offer - and in these cases, the person goes on my "do not rez without a lot of groveling" list :)  Same goes for my wizard in this case - in other words, if I have to work to get you something, you better offer me something even though I've not asked for it!<br />
