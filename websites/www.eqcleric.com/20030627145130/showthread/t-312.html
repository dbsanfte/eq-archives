<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">First let me say that I don't, nor will i ever roleplay, I just don't get that whole aspect of the game.  I just play because it's a cool game that always has someting new to do regardless of how long you play.  Honestly I used to think that they RPers were the people who spent way too much time in game and needed to find new hobbies, but after playing for while I can say that for the most part they seem to be nice people who for some reason like becoming a game character. The whole problem comes about when pople who have the RP next to thier name start coming to me in character and want to start up a RP conversation.  So I tell them nicely that I will not RP and  if they need to be revived or healed or cured to just ask me, and if they want to RP they really should go elsewhere. I think that is resonable answer but on more than one occasion thyy come back with a tirade that says something along the lines of that EQ is a RPG and if I don't want to RP than I should cancel the account and do something else.  Why do these people expect me to Rp when I do not have the RP up on my name?? Can't they just find people to talk to through the use of filters?? Like I said they need something, all they have to do is ask but I am not going to do something that I don't want to do so they can continue to dwell in some fantasy world of thiers?<br />
Also while I really don't get a chance to group as much as I should I find it bizzare that while in group and we are all meditating or waiting for something to kill we all must talk everquest and only everquest.  Everyone needs to inspect each other and brag about what thier wisdom is  and what thier weapon does and how much damage to thier critical hits.   I have other interests like riding motorcycles and mountain bikes, watching movies, music, e.t.c. and I have on numerous occasions tried to talk about anythng besides eq, yet it seems that no on cares if it doesn't have a focus effct or high AC.  Anyone else have this problem, I think that is the reason why the friends list is empty is because I can't live and breath eq. I thought about joining a guild until I heard that they keep attendance and require you to play at x time on x day, sorry but I am not rearranging my RL to play a game.  We should start forming anti-guilds that are basically for the people( and I bet there are more of us than there are of the serious gamers)who like playing the game and want to join groups with similair minded people who are playing for fun.  Anyone agree???</td>

I have had one person start ranting at me in OOC for not realizing he was in RP once. I apologized but he wouldnt stop. It irritated me, so I went RP, and chalanged him to duel so we could settel thine dispute in the manner of knights. He declined but shut up. Probably good thing, as I was playing my 29 Shammy and he was on a 27 War.  Root/Rot...war toast. Please pardon me but yon mountain becons to me.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hate people who use incorrect Old English, And hate it when people use it to act like they are roleplaying. It takes a good Imagination to RP in EQ, Walking around in Neriak I can just imagine the uneasy looks I get from the guild loyal to Queen Thex. I normally RP in and around Neriak/Nektulos. All my characters are related and all have their own storyline. Buncha twins =|..Maelarr and Dugall are twins, Sebulsiss and Jabiss are twin brothers hatched from the same egg. Uaeelayianiu is Maelarrs neice through his older sister Shessar, Dugall is currently stationed in Faydwer and is on duty working with the Teir'Dal camps. Maelarr travels the world seeking to spread the good (bad) word of Innoruuk. How he is a God of Freedom and Power over those who would seek to capture you. Uaeelayianu recently attended her first guided meditation and mageling school =). She is never seen without a gust of air following her around now that she can summon elementals. Jabiss is training in the Tower of Kurn, practicing control over the undead, and effective combat routines against them (he's a SK) Sebulsiss(monk) runs daily patrols in search of escaped frogloks. Shaylee is Maelarrs bastard daughter, her mother was raped in the commonlands one night on Maelarrs first assignment with the Cauldron of Hate members, She has rejected her dark lineage and is currently in combat training to become a full fledged member of the Paladin order of Rodcet Nife. <br />

I NEVER assume that other players I encounter in game are into Roleplay as we are. I find a simple /tell to the player asking about RP right off the bat easily explains why my Dark Elf Cleric of Hate grumbles in /say about healing an Elven Paladin ect... The player knows right away that it is the Dark Elf complaining and NOT me, the player. I am always too happy to toss a heal/buff/rez to others and exlain it as that it prolongs that Character's time of suffering on Norrath.hehe<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Personally, I do not think its possible for you to play this game and not roleplay to some extent.  In my experience there are those who attempt to take on a classic roleplaying genre for thier class and have fun doing this.  Others,  choose to be themselves in as their character.  There is an evolution though that I have seen.  I for one am not entirely like Cerrick. Nor are my real life friends like their characters. <br />
Also, seems like you can gerenalize groupings of classes and the people that play them.  Rangers for instance seem to be quiet folks, not altogether engaguing in conversation.  I think the play style of the diffent classes lends itself to how much a person might roleplay or moreso, how their character might appear to the rest of the online players. Clerics have a tendancy to talk alot (cause we sit around and med).  Casters in general have less button pushing to do lending themselves to more outgoing people, or folks that would choose to say as much as they do.<br />
<br />
EQ is a roleplaying game in as much as anything totally online is.  Some choose to take this a step further, others leave it as that.. avatar's of thier own persona.<br />
<br />
Point is to have fun, and not ruin someone elses gaming experience by trying to force your RP approach down other people's throat.. that tend to make them want to vomit.</td>

<br />
The point is, a guild is just a community of like-minded individuals who play for the same purpose.  You shouldn't have any trouble finding a guild that shares your purpose for playing.  Ask around, guilds really do enhance your gaming experience and make EQ much more fun!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">everyone roleplays cause who you are in RL or who you pretend to be in game shows.  even if you are devoutly against roleplaying and think it is pointless...who ever you are and however you act..is your role.  you don't have to activly think about it it will just come out if you talk to anyone....i have been with people who use the old english stuff..and even one person who would not buff anyone unles they used it too..i disbanded them. i play a cleric cause i like helping people im the guy thats givin stuff away and spending 3 hours with a lv 1 newbie in Gfay to help him learn the game.  how many times has someone givin you a 5K item out of the blue? not often but i do it.  only to people i know deserve it and know it won't go invain.  you can tell when ya got a true noob and when ya got a moocher.  it is cause of the rarity of random acts of kindness that i do it.  when i was a lv 4 pally (long long long time ago...1999 ish) someone came up to me and asked me if i wanted to buy a lockjaw tunic..i said i had only been playing a week and only had 4 play so far..the tunic was like 50 plat... and he said here..you can have it.  that felt realy good and i wore that tunic proudly. thats why i give stuff away.  to people who need it<br />
<br />
as long as you play a class that reflects who you are...you don't need to roleplay at all..just be yourself.. and when i play my necro...im just a really nice necro....<br />

if ya really wanna roleplay try RP'ing a mute warrior =)<br />
