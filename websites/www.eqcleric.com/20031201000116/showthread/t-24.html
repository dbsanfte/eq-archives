<br />
The fact will have it that 255 wisdom is maximum of what you can get. However it's not the maximum of what mana you can have. A 19 cleric with 255 wisdom is a well set cleric. You have many levels to raise the mana pool by supplementing with mana equipment. I would not be worried for a long time :)</td>

<br />
     Now to this proposed "Balancing" I hear about from the thread, I agree with Monaco, they should be looking for better ways to enhance CLR'S, battle clerics are a long awaited arrival, but the changes that are being looked apun are deffinitly not the answer, I mean Look at what you are doing to the class and the other classes, SHA'S are potion makers and stat buffers, healers, DRU'S are DoT, DS, buff, healers now.<br />
<br />
     What does the cleric do? Heal, and HP buff, thats about all we are good for right now, we are not major nukers, cannot melee worth anything, are given a weak defense skill(Dodge), cannot DoT, no stat buffs that last more than a few ticks, we are given spells that I have never needed or used, we need grps at higher lvls to make any gain, at lower lvls till we actually get our next heal we are grped with some that make it imposible to get any good xp, sure we can get a better ac than other priest classes, but we are combat insufficient, we cannot hold our own in combat, have a hard time soloing to any degree of success and have long periods of down time.  And that is menchaning a few flaws.<br />
<br />
     We are the weakest class among the priest classes are VI are making the other priest classes better? Giving our bread(rezzes) was one thing, but our water(CHEAL), when will enough be enough, DRU's have gotten new spells to port to Luclin, we have not received anything.<br />
<br />
     Giving us spells and a pet at higher lvls will only help higher lvls, what about lower lvls? the druids spells are at the mid lvl point, so why not give us more mid spells?  I mean I want to solo but at 33 and not able to get to lvl 56 anytime soon, the new spells are pointless.  We need new spells for the lower lvls. I have had 2 cleric's, 1 is 33, the other is 60 and being 60, I still do not see any real use for the new spells, sure some may start to melee again, but after 20 some odd lvls? O...K...!?<br />
<br />
     If you really want to balance out the priest classes, let us clerics keep our domain as the ultimate healers and CHeal to us, change up the hammer line for lower lvls( even though I had a centi Warhammer at 20 from Bazaare), give us a mana regen we can use on ourselves and others, like clarity(even sounds like it should be a CLR spell), give us better nukes agains summoned and undead, at least 3 DoT spells for nonundead and summoned<that are at least decent please>, DD spells the hit about same as DRU DD spells, maybe 10 percent penalty there<for balancing>, give us a higher max on dodge<like around 125>, and parry<at least to skill value of 100>, Give us a pet that would stay after a battle and hits harder with more hp to it, not as much as other pets<which have insane amount of power when compared to the powers of there masters>.<br />
<br />
     If you would do at least a few of these things<keeping CHEAL for CLERICS only>, then the CLR Class would be balanced so that we would have the ability to do some soloing that would be at least a little beneficial, make us more capable to defend ourselves in Melee, with the new attack spells we would still be inferior to DRU's capabilities and still would not be able to buff like the SHA class<or make potions even>.  Besides all this SHA are ownly available to less developed races<tech and educ lvls, for Roleplaying purposes>and are such supposed to be less learned in the healing arts as cleric races, as the CLR class period.  DRU's are in tune with nature and protect it, only 3 of there races can become clerics, DRUs as a class are very well rounded, they can solo to the highest lvls from early on, so they can lvl faster than other priest classes, they can port to locations that CLRs need to get help with getting to and they can Buff stats a little less than SHA but way more than CLR could.  The issue is not would we like to "Balance out" the priest classes here, its lets fix the CLR class because clerics have not gotten the attention we deserve from the designers through the expansions.<br />
<br />
     To put it mildly, we CLR's will be no longer necessary to Narrath or her moon, we will become extinct as a class and the DRU and SHA will replace us, please make it a point to not let this happen.  The changes that have been presented would Destroy the ability for the CLR class to be redesigned<fixed>, if the cleric class is not updated to the changes that have happened in norrath thenwe all will need to say to ourselves "is this really want we want to do with our time?  Make a class thats useless?".<br />
<br />
But all this is just my opinion.</td>

<br />
Long ago, I was a druid.  Then, before the lands of Kunark were discovered, and I was bored of doing the same old things at the highest level then attainable, I decided to try the cleric calling.  Well, the poor druid is still but level 52... <br />
<br />
So now they think they are making us battle clerics?  Bah, they're too late for me.  I've been a battle cleric since I got my wonderful brawlstick...<br />
<br />
"Your body screams with the power of an avatar!"<br />
"You try to crush a Shissar Taskmaster, but miss!"<br />
<br />
I dunno what they're thinking!  Yeah I can, with my maxed 2hb of 175, hit with the primal 2hb for 190.  Of course, I also can hit for 5.  But mostly... I miss :p<br />
<br />
Honestly, I cannot see the end game role of the cleric being any different after the changes on test go live.  I can't complain that the druid in my group as a back up healer will be more effectively able to keep the group alive while I'm on CH rotation.  But that's got to be a different point of view than the cleric who is lfg in Sebilis or Velk's - something I've not done in nearly two years, so I think I have a rather shortened perspective of the whole thing.  I'm very fortunate to have a solid guild of friends, with shared goals, that I can group with - many of whom I've played with since EQ went public over three years ago, and some even from the game before EQ.<br />
<br />
Without those friends, there would be no game.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I hear alot of complaining from clerics crying about the fact that they will no longer be useful and that now they will be in the shadows of druids and shaman. I tend to disagree. Clerics also got new heal upgrades with group Celetial Elixer and upgrades in the Remedy and Divine Light line of spells. Clerics will never be replaced by Shamans or Druids when it comes to healing (btw they arent getting CH it's 75% and let's see what the cast time mana efficiency is like) during High End Boss battles. I guess the biggest worry people seem to have is the fact that clerics will now be shunned in exp groups. This is also not true imo. A good group is gonna have a shaman and a cleric first of all. Then the question is why a cleric and not a druid? Well either way you are gonna have more than enough hgealing with a sham/cleric or sham/druid in the group. Druid has evac DS and snare to offer? As well as some mediocre nukes. Cleric buffs are superior and now with the new hammer and yaulp 5 throw some shaman buffs on your groups cleric and not only do you have an exceptional healer/buffer but you now have a decent bit of DPS added to the group.<br />
<br />
If all else fails when it comes to finding a group for us clerics now go solo. We now have the ability to do it efficiently and trust me after sitting on your ass for all these years and doing nothing but healing, this will add a very nice touch to playing a cleric. <br />
<br />
Overall I must say I think this is a great thing Verant has done. I have played a cleric for 3 yrs now and after testing out the new cleric I am quite pleased.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello everyone...I look forward to participating in this forum.<br />
<br />
I came to EQ from a D&D background.  I loved playing D&D clerics and, of course, my first EQ character was a cleric.  I was so dissapointed that I almost quit the game.<br />
<br />
However, while doing research trying to find a way to play a cleric the way I wanted to, I found a few very compelling things about rogues, and have been one ever since.  I really enjoy playing the class.<br />
<br />
I've had an EQ style clerric as an alt for quite some time, but I spend very little time playing him, as I find the role boring and effete.  Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
But when I heard about the proposed changes to clerics, I created an entirely new cleric.  Dwarf Cleric, maxed out starting wisdom, put the rest into strength.  Gave him 1K to get started and went to the Bazaar.  Emphasis on STR and AC, got a nice fast Burning Brand to keep 1HB up.  Have soloed him to 20th in an amazingly short period of time (Thanks for Paludal, Verant!).<br />
<br />
With self-buffs only, he wades into battle with these stats (approximately...I'm not anal anough to memorize every single stat on my toons lol)...<br />
<br />
STR 131<br />
AGI 95<br />
DEX 106<br />
WIS 121<br />
<br />
AC 550<br />
HP 700 (Cast Celestial Remedy before wading into battle and effective HP jumps considerably)<br />
ATK 400<br />
<br />
Its very hard to keep 1HB maxed out, I plan on using training points toward this along with Bash.<br />
<br />
So far he solos exceptionally well.  I'm still developing tactics, but right now I can solo two dark blue mobs at the same time with relative ease (a Spell Haste focus item is essential for spell casting while meleeing).  I can take on three dark blues, but its an iffy situation...if I can get one successful root off, then I'll own them.  Other wise I DA, leap into the waters below and use the time the critters take to path to me to Gate out.<br />
<br />
Single yellow mobs are a good fight.  If I couldn't get a couple DD's off it would be a toss-up as to who would win.  With successful DD's I end the fight at about 50 life and 40 mana.  <br />
<br />
Double yellows are an adrenaline rush.  Root one, back off and melee/DD the other and kill it quick.  Re-root the other, heal and DD until there's only enough mana for Gate, then wade in and finish it off melee-style.  These fights (when succesful heheh) leave me at about 20 or less life and OOM except for the Gate reserve.<br />
<br />
Conventional wisdom keeps insisting that my battle-cleric will run out of steam somewhere between 25 and 30th level, and have to revert to a rear echelon role.  That may be, but I am prepared to bankrupt my main to provide this little guy with whatever gear will enable him to continue his career.  I love playing  my rogue, but if I can make a battle-cleric work, I will definitely demote the rogue to alt and make the cleric my main.</td>

Hit 60 with /played of 45 days, 11 hours, 4 min<br />
<br />
My first char was a Mage, played till lvl 36 and quit EQ being disenchanted due to never finding groups.  Started up again when some RL friends I heard had played on a PvP server, tried that, hated it, so started Noub here on Tholuxe again.  I wanted a char that was more groupable hehe.  Magelo stuff is here<br />

I reside on the server of Prexus and am just a few steps away from completing my dream of getting my epic.   I became a cleric so that I could heal the hurt and suffering of Norrath and I must admit it is much harder than you would think.  I wander about the lands healing, buffing and ressing the adventurers of Norrath and passing out goodwill and cheer, hoping that one day my crusade to bring happiness to others wins out over the darkness that has settled over our lives.<br />

Hope to hear more from you all!<br />
