Race: High Elf<br />
Class: Cleric<br />
Did it go anywhere: lvl 35 and counting<br />
<br />
Why did I have two characters with identical race and class and very similar names?  Well Qonos was to be my main guy which I would play with my two RL friends (who played shaman and warrior), and I created Qunos to explore the game ahead of time, before we were scheduled to begin playing together (my warrior friend didn't buy EQ until a couple months after I did, and my shaman friend has been playing EQ for 3 years on the RZ server).<br />
<br />
I was going to delete Qunos after playing for a while and then concentrate on Qonos.  How foolish of me to think that my life would not get totally sucked into the world of EQ.  I ended up playing Qunos far more often than Qonos, since I was only on Qonos when my two other friends were on.  Now Qonos is only lvl 35, while my "main" is currently lvl 65/71 and maxed tradeskills.  My lower lvl cleric gets all the hand-me-downs from my main whenever he gets a new piece of equipment.  They even have the same surname and identical dye pattern (dblue arms and legs, and white everything else).  It's funny when people that my main knows hail me and ask for V, and I say, umm sorry I'm not high enough lvl to V you.  What?!  You just gave me V a few hrs ago!  lol.....</td>

<br />
Serafin was born July, 2000 when my boyfriend started playing EQ.  I made her on his account and didn't think I'd like the game too much... needless to say, I did.  When we realized that using the same account really sucked, I abandoned Serafin and made a new identical cleric, Seraphin.  We leveled up together to mid-50s and quit the game, at which time I gave (not sold) both accounts to an aquaintance in game.  Now roughly 4 years later I've returned to the game and, understandably, my friend was hesitant to let go of Seraphin after leveling her to 65, getting her her shawl, epic, etc., so he handed me my boyfriend's account with my first cleric, frozen in time at level 26. ;)  She's 47 now.  I've never played any class other than cleric past the teenage years.  It's the class that draws me in the most.</td>

Funny thing was when he was gone away on a business trip I made a shaman and leveled her to level 12 before he got home. Now my shaman is level 52 my cleric is level 51 and monk still level 19 guess I can play the spell casting classes ok :D .  Another funny thing is that my exhusband quit the game when he discovered I could play the game better than he did he didn't like our in game friends reminding him that my chars were higher than his and he played EQ a year longer than I did. &#123;rolleyes}</td>

I also didn't have the patience to make my own spells (ehem, this was before I discovered trade skilling with a vengeance). She's still on my character selection screen. I just don't have the heart to delete her. But I am greatly enjoying my cleric, so I don't log my wizzy on anymore.</td>

she didn't stay alive long enough!  she kept getting lost.  those uppity folks at the campfire would not talk to her.  she was essentially blind.  she died...alot.  she couldn't get to the corpse to get her nifty cloth & rusty gear (wow! they gave me a sword to start with?) - finally, after many long and arduous battles, she perished at the hands of a very cruel guard at the tender age of 4.  from her ashes Malenya the woodelf ranger was born...lived to the ripe old age of 41 and has been retired.  Malenya begat Maleenia, a young bard who succumbed to her death at 35.  somewhere in between them all have been born several miscellaneous characters, all unique in their own Norrathian ways.

Worlik was my first toon and was based on a long running D&D character I have played for years. I raised his smithing to 178 back when banded mail was l33t.

Anarchy Reigns - DE chanter, Meatwall Saehrimnir - Ogre Warrior, Beyggvir Flygvapen - Halfling Druid, and Worlik haven't made it much farther yet. My only other high level toon is my third attempt at a rogue, Doover N`Over. His predicessor was a halfling rogue Redo Ransack, whom I killed off because I didn't want a Brell rogue. (Was KoS in a few rogue guilds and being pre-Kunark was long before their were trainers all over the expanded realms.)<br />

Then I logged off and didnt try and play again for a month or two. Never found the character again either. I finally figured out how to enter the chat area where some kind person explained thet there was a tutorial, then i went through that and made a human cleric who go to level 5. Someone twinked her with some crappy mace that i thought was the coolest. Then i traveled to West Karana, because I was level 5 and therefore was big enough to go anywhere. She died at the bandit farm and I never found her corpse. I was so upset i stopped playing all together intil 6 months later when I found out practically half the people at my college played.<br />

Mayliu is my first character and will always be the one I am most attached to.  I began playing because I was so intrigued by the game when I watched my husband play his Dark Elf Shadowknight.  I had no clue what I was doing on the server select screen other than picking the server my husband played on.  I also had no clue what I was doing on the stat select screen other than adding to the stats that were in green.  Maneuvering Neriak city was something I thought I'd never get used to.  Had a blast playing even though I quickly realized that PvP wasn't for me.  I stayed on VZ until I was level 60 and around 20 AAs and then decided to do a server switch to a blue server (before the days that transfers with gear were allowed).  I moved to Nameless in January of 2003 and I've been here ever since.  Mayliu is still my true love even after 65 levels and about 225 AAs and doing the epic quest twice (yes, twice!)</td>

When my roomie and I decided to start EQ, she got the game like two weeks before I did, so I settled down to watch her play. She made a high elf mage right off the bat, just by looking at the info on the character creation screen (and she still refuses to change mains to this day, 4 years and 65 levels later). Anyway, when she first logged into the game, the gamma correction was all the way down, and of course we didn't know anything about what was happening or how to change it -- all we knew was that the screen was so dark she could barely see. She kept falling into the water and drowning... it was so awful and frustrating that we almost gave up. Fortunately a kind soul came by and explained things to her, and once we could see what was going on, we were both hooked.<br />
<br />
I researched on the net for weeks before I started, trying to decide on my class, and ultimately decided on cleric. Originally I wanted to be a gnome, but my mage friend pointed out that I would start in a different city, and how would we ever find each other in game?? :) So I made a high elf instead.<br />
<br />
I originally enjoyed being a cleric very much, but eventually, my patience with the class waned -- I felt stagnant and trapped in my role. I tried a variety of other classes, keeping the cleric as my main... until I made my beastlord. I soloed him up so fast, and had so much fun doing it that it was only slightly painful for me to change my main to the bst without a second thought.<br />
<br />
Crovan came into existance when I started a second account and wanted to be able to rez my beastlord. At the time, character moves between accounts weren't available (or maybe I just didn't know about them, I don't recall now), so I started a brand new cleric, a dark elf this time because I had discovered that I like being evil. Elembri only gets played when I need to rez or buff or PL a toon on Crovan's account... sadly, he was my very first toon, and it shows in his terrible gear. Crovan had better at level 1 than poor Elembri is wearing at 53. I've always said that when I have plat to burn, I'll buy him some nice stuff just because I still have a soft spot for him.<br />
<br />
Now I've got two 50+ clerics, and I don't regret either one of them at all... I'm enjoying being a cleric again when I play him solo or group him with others besides my own alts, recapturing a little of what I liked so much about the class in the beginning. It's still not where my EQ heart is set, but I appreciate the class more for what it is now, and hopefully am a better cleric after playing and understanding the DPS and Tank roles that I fulfil in different situations on my beastlord.<br />

Well, yes.  Only about 8(? maybe more I dunno) months ago did I officially change my main.  I played the druid up to 65 eventually, was actually the second one in my guild to ding 65 (guild leader being first).  Think that drove a lot of the others in my guild to strive upward.  Anyway, yeah played him a while, but kept finding myself playing healer a lot, and only when no clerics were available (/who all clerics lfg........damn there are some gonna be lfg a while).  So started playing up a cleric on my second account, which took MUCH less time than my druid.  Figured why not, I'm playing main healer most of the time, might as well get the whole package right?  <br />
<br />
Playing up a druid sure helped teach me how to heal as well, even more so I think since druid healers have to be even extra cautious/mana effective.  I still have the druid of course, and he still has his uses.  I pull him out if there's a mob I want to take down, he plays healer while my cleric tanks, and usually my enchs there to slow (I have 4 accounts, 3 comps, workin on getting a fourth soon probably heh heh).  65 druid+65 cleric makes a GREAT pl team, DS on alt, DS on cleric, pull tons of mobs and all i gotta worry about is getting one hit in with alt.  <br />
<br />
OK, so he's more of a tool now, but I put a lot more time and effort to get him where he is than I did with my cleric when they were equal level/gear/aa's (course now my cleric is way better equipped, lots more aa's and one kill from EP flagged, druid got a bit left behind).  Still always have a soft spot in my heart for him, and there's still a bunch from the old guild (left for a raiding guild about 3 months ago) that still call me by druids name even when I'm on my cleric.</td>

Comments:  My very first char was my mage and I played her as my main until my hubbie and I bought a second computer and 1 of us had to restart their char so we could play together. I knew I wanted to try my hand at a cleric or chanter and when we got the second account my hubbie had a full time exp group he played with that had a chanter so I decided that insted of having 2 chanters I would start a cleric as they had a druid for heals. I dont remember that they had char transfer services back then so I couldnt just transfer my mage to my own account I had to start over. Once my cleric was born it didnt take long for me to fall inlove with her , she got all my play time until my cleric was 50ish. Then I started missing my mage and feeling like sit , stand cheal was my life and I wanted more LOL. By this time char transfers were launched and you could move chars accross servers and accounts. My hubbie was uncomfy with moving mains as he felt that they may be lost , this service was new and allot of people didnt trust it yet lol , our friends were telling us that we may loose a main if we moved it so we decided that it was safer to move my mage as she was an alt. My mage got moved to The nameless from MT and to my clerics account and I was able to play her when I needed a break from healing. For the first little while I got on my mage every chance I got and started thinking that a mage was maybe more of what I wanted to play. In time I have had ups and downs on my cleric but as time passes I realise that she is my fav char and all the others are just alts . My mage is 20 % from 56 /giggles she didnt go to far after fairy was born and only got the level she did from the times I was bored and wanted to solo for a while .<br />
<br />
 My mage will always have a special place in my heart as the game held so much wonder for me while I was a mage . I was in Gfay by the ent to Felwithe and minding my own business when this dark elf came up to me and asked me if I could take a min to give him a hand , he had lost his cr by some kos guards and needed someone to pull his cr away from the guards so he could loot his gear ( I had never herd of a ress at this point lol). I had never been out of the newbie area of felwithe so I was a little scared to be going off to somewhere I had never been with someone I didnt know , but I felt bad for this guy so I went with him. I followed him thru Gfay and into BBM ( didnt know it was BBM at the time) we got almost to the docks when I got attacked by gobbie, I died about 3 feet from the guards at the docks in BBM . It was night time in game and I also didnt know much about the gama setting so all I could see was a weird shape behind the guards but I had no clue it was the docks. When I returned to bind I got a tell from this DE asking me what happened and if I had moved his cr , I told him a monster got me and I was back at fel dead . He asked me if I was going to come back to him and help him , I told him I had no idea of where he had taken me but if he came back for me I would try again , and I also needed him to come back and get me so I could loot my CR . I waited a few mins and got no reply so I sent another tell and this time I was Told he was offline. I started to freak out as I had no clue where he had taken me or how to get all my gear back . I spent most of that night trying to get my Cr back but couldnt come even close to finding it as I had no clue where he had taken me , I lost my first Cr that night and in time once I realised how close I was to my CR I laugh my ass off at myself as it was so close but to me it was so far away .</td>
