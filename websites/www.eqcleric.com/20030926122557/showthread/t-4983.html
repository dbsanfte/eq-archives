<br />
What do you dislike about the class?  Now, let me point out that I believe all classes have their weaknesses - I do not believe clerics should have appreciable soloing ability.  But, what would you change?  And what do you think about the weaknesses of the cleric class?  (I'm personally hard-pressed to think of any outside of our lack of soloing for worthwhile experience).<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">What originally drew me to playing a dark elven cleric?  Definitely AD&D.<br />
<br />
One of the best memories of playing AD&D that I have is from around twenty years ago.  (Yes, I'm old, I know.)  We were playing through the "Against the Giants" modules, and this was back in the days when they were sold as three separate little booklets.  After many weeks of play, we'd finally made it into the depths of King Snurre's dungeons.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that nobody had ever even <i>heard</i> of the Drow at this point.  To us, Elves were good and nice, Tolkeinesque figures; an evil elf was unheard-of.<br />
<br />
It was then that the rogue in the party, scouting ahead, encountered the Drow Priestess, Eclavdra.  Now, at the time, we had the best DM that I've ever met, and our DM managed to bring the character of Eclavdra totally to life in our minds.<br />
<br />
And that's what Shadowfrost was when I rolled her.  An old DM's interpretation of Eclavdra, re-interpreted by me.<br />
<br />
What keeps me playing a cleric now, 175 days /played later?  I like it.<br />
<br />
I mean, the class suits me.  I'm an intensely social person and I like to chat, a lot.  Being a cleric gets me out into groups so I can meet people, and it's usually sufficiently undemanding that I can spend a lot of time talking.  I've generally got several windows devoted to different chats that I'm participating in.<br />
<br />
To me, that's why EQ has been such a success.  The actual gameplay isn't all that great, really... but it's easy.  Exp grouping, raiding, camping rare spawns, tradeskilling, none of these are hard, most of them are extremely repetitive, and most of the time they don't take up a lot of attention.  What they <i>do</i> do is to give you something to look at and a few keys to press while you chat.<br />
<br />
I suppose that to me, Norrath is basically just a huge internet chat room with fantasy-themed graphics.<br />
<br />
To someone with that attitude, cleric is an ideal class to play, particularly compared to the classes which require a large number of keystrokes.  I could never play a bard.</td>

<br />
I like the support role, feeling needed in a group and I love meeting new people.  My first main was a chanter and even when I COULD solo I didn't, I still grouped when i could find one. I enjoy chatting and getting to know people in a game that there are so many mixed personalities and being a cleric allows for that. Sure we can't solo, but if I wanted to solo I would have made a necro!!<br />
<br />
One of the downfalls I see is I feel terrible when someone dies in my group. I do my best to keep everyone alive and I know at times deaths will happen, but I still feel responsible.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">/agree Keyera - That's one of the driving motives for me to play a cleric.<br />
<br />
I began EQ last year as a Barbarian warrior. I fought in Everfrost, Qeynos Hills and West Karana. The cities I visited were Halas, Qeynos and once Surefall Glade. I didn't have any expansions at the time so I didn't see too many different races. The majority were Barbarians, Humans and sometimes I might see an Elf (this was before PoP mind you). I had different buffs generously cast on me at times and I always wondered what it was like to play a caster.<br />
<br />
The day came when I upgraded to all expansions (last August). I <i>had</i> to travel to the bazaar to check that out so I made the l-o-n-g run to the spires in WK. When I arrived in the Nexus I was totally blown away by all the different races, levels and diversity! One of the most fascinating races to me was the Dark Elf.<br />
<br />
Eventually the time came for me to make my first alt. It was going to be a Dark Elf but I wasn't sure what class to make although I wanted a caster. My cousin, who has been playing since the EQ release, suggested a cleric. I played the cleric for awhile but in the early stages didn't understand the role completely. In time and after reading many informative websites I learned what a cleric's part in EQ is (although I'm learning more and more each day thanks to you guys;)).<br />
<br />
Around this time I picked up "alt-itis" and began many new characters. It wasn't until January when I was playing my shaman in Marus Seru when a friend of the monk in our group, who was a 65 cleric named Semirahge on Zeb, came and helped us out. She cast BoA on the group and stood by assisting us for around an hour. I was totally blown away by the power she wielded and since then I've been devoted to my cleric.<br />
<br />
I just have the most fun keeping people going in the game. When I'm traveling and see someone sitting to heal, it always makes me feel good to throw a heal their way. And it's fun buffing low level players to help them out in their early lives. When there is a death, it makes me feel awful as well and it usually bugs me for quite a while after and I'm always thinking what I could have done to prevent it.<br />
<br />
It took me a while to find my calling in EQ, but I finally realized I'm a cleric at heart.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I started bouncing from toon to toon when I first started EQ. Tried a Rog, a war, a Pally.. I could rarely find a group. I had noticed that I had rarely seen a cleric even shout LFG as they got scooped up soon as they stepped into the zone.<br />
<br />
So I thought up a cool name (my prerequisite to starting a new toon.. vain.. I know) and rolled Phixin.<br />
<br />
I found that playing a cleric came naturally to me. Tremendous highs when you save the whole group from certian death, terrible lows when one or more people died.<br />
<br />
So to answer the question.. Yeah, Cleric is my favorite class. It is a difficult class to play unless all you do is med/heal/med/heal. I learned to solo, when to stand up with the tanks and beat on mobs and when to stand back and make sure no one dies. I love my cleric and I think (hope) I am a respected cleric on CT.  I just wish I had a better comp to make it FUN for me to go to PoP. I hate looking at the ground for 2 hours at a time to avoid lag.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In all games, I have over-emphasized the importance of longevity, mostly in the form of healing. I had issues with action games where one hit killed you. I always play some sort of class that can heal, or barring that uses ranged attack. (I was definitely made for Amazon in D2.)<br />
<br />
After glancing at the manual, I started a druid figuring I could "heal and do other stuff." I got exactly what I bargained for, until I started to realize at around level 50 that the other stuff was nice, and so was the healing, but neither stood on their own to make me worthwhile to people. I simply wasn't happy with my druid any more, so I decided it was time for a change. I had to choose between healing and doing other stuff.<br />

I chose healing. I don't think I'd be happy playing any other class.</td>

I originally had a dark elf cleric as a kid, when I played D&D.<br />
When I saw EQ in Beta, I knew what class/race I wanted from the get-go.<br />
<br />
As for what keeps me playing? Alot of it, is my boyfriend. If he didn't play as much as he does, I would play alot less. Partly my guild, because overall I love them to pieces. Lastly, just a general long-time love for the class. I have a god(ess) complex, and being a cleric feeds that, to an extent.</td>

Myself, I ended up switching to a cleric (from magician) because I like being overly helpful, useful, and needed.  Also, I felt the cleric was a lot more safe for traveling, self-dependant, and able to survive in general.<br />
<br />
What it came down to is helping others, though.  Whether it's just being a reliable healer for our exp group, or buffing random people on karnors wall back in the day, running three zones to do a res, or taking part in 1-group fear break's, I've truly enjoyed the cleric class.</td>

<br />
I still play my cleric because its fun to know you have everyones life in your hands and the group depends on you. In my case it's also fun to flaunt when your exceptionally good at playing your class =).<br />

It's also fun to know guilds need you and so do groups.</td>

<br />
looking back i think i needed to feel needed and i like to help people in any way i can in RL. i'm always the shoulder to cry on and i alwys have girls comming to me for advice on this guy they like, or on their boyfriend or whatever. <br />
<br />
also a big factor, was my cleric is my second character, my first being a gnome chanter, who made it to 16 and lost his corpse. at 12-15 in nro, chanters dont get the good press that they do at later levles. dont get me wrong, i got groups, but i found myself always beeing passed up for that extra tank, or the 3rd wizzy. i had always heard that clerics got groups right away which i thought would be a nice change. <br />
<br />
when i started playing a cleric, healing people felt natural and i fell rigth into the roll of helping out teh group and some times running it from behind the lines. i loved barking orders at stupid tanks in HK and i loved seeing almost everyone in the group at  1 bubble and oom as the last mob feel to the ground with everyone in there meleeing! its such a rush to get that "wow battering! you rock!" right after everyone almost doesnt makes it out!<br />
<br />
what i dont like about the class? the disrespect taht we get from the stupid n00bs!!! /grr <br />
<br />
dont get confusied, i know i'm a newbie and a lowbie, but by no reasoning in hell am i a n00b!!!! i was till about lvl 12, but i changed. now i look at all the people ahat that are lvl 28 and have no idea how to play their character and almost get the entire group killed because of their ignorance then dont thank me AT ALL when i save their butts! if i could change anything, it would be the way stupid people  act towards us./sigh</td>

<br />
I love playing cleric, it was truly a good fit for my personality.  I have played alts chaner, SK, mage, Pally, and Shammy; but I have not found a class that engages my attention in RL like playing a cleric -- watching health, adding utility where able, watching for adds.  We have one basic role but there are so many other tools that we have to subtlely enhance raids and groups.  I do wish we have some travelling utility -- even self only.  <br />
<br />
When I started a character on Stromm to relax, I recreated my cleric - same race, starting stats, and even appearance to see how much my knowledge will help as I level her up.</td>

My friend and I wanted to play Dark Elves and she wanted a Rogue. Obvious choice for me was a cleric. I've fallen in love and ever since, I haven't regretted a moment. <br />

Leveled him to 52 and took a little over a year off. Leveled a Wizard up to 61, got bored with soloing and the not-so-lucky LFG sessions. <br />
I got back to playing Senchen about a month ago and have really enjoyed playing him. The idea of a needed supporting player appeals to me as well as getting into groups easier. <br />
I like the idea of random acts of kindness as I'm walking through zones, heals and buffs just to help out the lower lvls. <br />
Plus, I have wanted this epic for a long time now.</td>
