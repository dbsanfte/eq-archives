All the symbols and all the HP buffs after Heroic Bond have been costing us clerics a lot of peridots to cast. A lot of people think that clerics are the rich bastages who master loot all the loot in Sebilis back in the day and didn't split it. Well, that's simply not true, we have to pay for peridots, and even then, I would always split the loot. /shrug, think I may have gotten off topic here, hehe.<br />

<br />
Maelarr if groups take a druid to heal over you thats just retarded and the group has mental damage. 2k hp heal, if your enchanter is your tank i myself have about 3.5 with virtue and BAoR pushing 4k when fully raid buffed. if your war is anyhalfway decent in a PoV group he should have at least 6.5k after buffs(ive grouped with a warriror with 5.5k buffed in PoV its not funny or fun kept him alive though :D ) i usually just take a BoT group if i can find it all the warriors that make it there are great.<br />
<br />
Bakanar theres a 65 cleric spell called Armor of the Zealot which is an upgrade to blessed armor of the risen where we get more mana and hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
now finally my take on druids...<br />
<br />
i never had a problem with them until i got to DL as a wee cleric and the majority of druids would sow and then go braindead for 20 minutes. druids got better as i got into higher lvl groups but were stilll preety useless with myself in the groups, why have like the 3rd best dots are the 3rd best nukes in the group just get a wizzy. then the worst thing the druids did was cry about how they cant heal at all, then they just became greedy bitches and i lost all respect for them, but even before that IMO as far as a group or a raid goes theyre the most useless class in the game. <br />
<br />
and yes I too have had a druid bring his weak kite attempt of a train onto my group.<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
Wow i noticed old stuff in my sig time to change it</td>

However dr00ds are a different thing all together. These aren't really a class it's more of a state of mind, or lack there of. You know the people who dileberalty do things to annoy you, cast their heal when your healing. Train your groups, KS you. on and on. Those are the people I hate in EQ.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Druids are your friends, your family, people you trust, folks that go out of their way sometimes to help you out. For instance I was in South Karana one day looking for Quillmane for my mage and a druid sends me a tell Hey come to loc xxxx xxxx. I go there and to my surprise he's going to let me loot quillmane's cloak if it drops.<br />
<br />
Dr00ds on the other hand have been around as long as their good counterparts. Dr00ds also play other classes. It's the mentality of the person not the class more often than not. They KS you for your camp spot cause they want it then claim it was your fault. They train you just for the sheer hell of it. They charge you out the ass for a port. <br />
<br />
This is what I'm referring to.<br />

Maosess says out of character Paying for port to Stonebrunt<br />
Morpork tells you How much?<br />
Maosess tells Morpork 40p<br />
Morpork tells you add another 30p on to that and I'll port<br />
<br />
...days later<br />
<br />
Maos says out of character Paying for port to Stonebrunt<br />
Morpork tells you how much<br />
...../ignore morpork<br />
I was about yae close to asking him how much he's going to pay for his next rez.<br />

Btw watch out for Druids and Wizards quadding in Dulak. I've seen horrid trains slaughter people in there caused by ppl trying to quad and failing horribly.<br />

Maelarr if groups take a druid to heal over you thats just retarded and the group has mental damage. 2k hp heal, if your enchanter is your tank i myself have about 3.5 with virtue and BAoR pushing 4k when fully raid buffed. if your war is anyhalfway decent in a PoV group he should have at least 6.5k after buffs(ive grouped with a warriror with 5.5k buffed in PoV its not funny or fun kept him alive though :D ) i usually just take a BoT group if i can find it all the warriors that make it there are great.<br />

<br />
Keep in mind, I'm only level 52. I've grouped with 58+ druids who have ALL tried to ghettoheal under my Cheals. I have, at best, almost 2k hp. Including AoF line and HB. My tanks dont have 6.5khp, my enchanters dont have 4khp, They arent getting Virtue, or even Aego from me. We arent going into BoT, PoV or any other Teir2 zones. all I'm grouping in is Seb, Pon, Poi, and Pod...Poj kinda really sucks I Dont go there unless I realy have to. I have to deal with groups who, upon finding out that I dont have my epic say "nope, we wunt 96% rez, sry". Even Velks floor groups want 96% rez. I have to compete with all the 56+ clerics, and clerics who are epic'd who can rez 96% for groups. I have to MAGICALLY obtain 56 despite the fact that NOBODY wants me in a group because I cant rez for FRIKKIN NINENTY-SIZ PERCENT!!! <br />
At my level, Evac + 2kheal+snare+nuke+dot=pretty damn good. They would much rather take the 4 levels above anyone in their group lvl 58+ druid over the 52 cleric that can Cheal. <br />
In summary: STFU!</td>

Huh a reagentless buff that adds to hp regen admittedly 2 hp isnt much at 50+ but still seems kind of out of line considering how close it is to herioc bond guess aego etc is supposed to make it for it being an all in one buff saving mana overall. Again sorry i dont know much about high lvl cleric buffs and i doubt hb stacks with aego or nature and id bet hb, nature are lower lvl then aego so it probably wouldnt matter forgive my ignorance but those 2 do seem out of line considering wed still have to cast symbol in addition to HB.</td>

Our buff can also be used as a very low agro heal, that was one of my favorite things about HB. How does it seem out of line? The druid buff at 59 has 6 mana per tick. They get added bonuses to their buffs to make them viable in certain situations over the superior HP/AC of the cleric buffs.

Do I know you Battering?  I think not.  You may have a few peeps you know that play druids and are asses but to class us all the same is a little ignorant.  I do not think I am an Ass when I play, but I may be wrong you can ask Jarvis, I have played with him before, but to throw us all into a common bowl and then insult me personally I will not stand for that!  People may not like Druids in general but I would think it to be best to get to know the peeps before you really start judging them and especially throwing them all into a big common Pot.<br />
<br />
I would also say that druids are really about the most pointless class in the game, you are all right, we do not have the best of anything, heals, dots, DD, and buffs.  We literally bring nothing to a group that can not be brought by another group that is even better.  Personally i think it sucks, but such is life, and that is why you always see druids out trying to do their quad kiting, or root/doting and all that boring BS that we get to do.  <br />

This is the kind of attitude from druids I just don't get. What does it mean to be "necessary" in a group?  No class is. Tanks can be Warrior, Paladin, or SKs; healers can be cleric, druid, or shaman. Slowers can be Shaman, Beastlord or enchanter, Crowd Control can be done by Enchanter, Bard. and improvised by others, Damage Dealers come in all varities, Pulling can be done by several classes, Evacs can be done by wizards or druids, etc. In general, no class is necessary...just types are necessary. It's the way EQ should be. There needs to be interchangeability. <br />
<br />
The basic truth is that in EQ only four real things are needed for a good group in a basic zone: tank, healer, slower/debuffer [and/or (depending on zones) crowd control], and damage dealing. Druids can fill at least two of these roles. Sure druids dont' heal as well as clerics, but they make a decent healer in exp groups and they contribute other things to the group such as a worthwhile DoT, DD, snare, ds, or charm. Alternatively, if a cleric is present they make fine back up healers who can do a fair amount of sustained dps while providing nifty things like damage shields and snare. Moreover, they are one of two classes with the evac line which is quite necessary in dungeons. No they don't nuke like a wizard, but then again the wizard can't throw in a heal if its needed.  So, druids aren't the best at anything per se, but few classes can do as many things for a group as a druid.  It is this utility, this being a good healer and a good nuker but not that best at either, that makes druids attractive to play and one of the few classes that can effectively solo. And maybe it does limit your attrativeness when folks want a "specialist," but it doesn't mean you don't bring anything important to the table. It just means that other players aren't aware of what that is.<br />
<br />
It strikes me that the druids greatest problem is bad press. Bad druids tend to set the reptuation for the rest. Morover, the complaints of the druid community on Druid's Grove tend to get heard widely and I think they embitter a lot of folks who feel druids are much more balanced than many other classes. Moreover, the sheer quantity of druids out there is staggering at times. I think the market is flooded with them, causing some to continue to sit on the shelf when the want groups. <br />
<br />
But most of us who have been around a while know a  few druids and are greatful for the times they've saved our hide. I'd rather not count the number of times I've been saved by a timely evac, heal, or nuke from a druid.</td>
