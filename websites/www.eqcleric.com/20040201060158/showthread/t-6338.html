Back in the early days of Everquest. I remember my first trip into Kithicor. I'm not sure why except maybe it was because it was ALWAYS dark and there were tales of "new" Undead that roamed the area at night. And believe me, for the first few days I was hunting near here, I was eaten by plenty of Undead Zombie Troopers and Tormented Corporal's!<br />

I followed the path because I thought to myself that surely I will be safe if I follow the path.  I immediately found out just how wrong I was.  A mummy immediately discovered me & made haste with my death.  lol I was so terrified to go back in there that I had one of my friends go in to retrieve my corpse.  So after that, I stayed as far away from that zone as I possibly could...until my 20's.  My regular hunting group decided to go to MM, so we ventured in & a brownie took out the enchanter otw, hence my fear of the brownie to this day, even at lvl 65 :p   Now when I go in for adventures, I just run right thru & make sure I stay clear of the brownies & the DE camp and I make sure I have SoW.</td>

First trip into Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br />
<br />
     I had just made lvl 39 and was memming spells when my guild leader at the time sent me a tell.  She was 47. She wanted me to go with her and a 52 Paladin to ToFS. The Paladin was trying for the 6th floor key. I was still memming spells when the druid ported us to Iceclad.  We ran over and zoned in. BAMM.. first thing I see is 2 spectre's there in front of me, and I had been killed so many times by the LOIO Specs that I nearly jumped out of my skin.  <br />
     After nearly an hour of working our way up, we made it to 6B..Everything had been conning RED to me for 2 floors.  Pally pulled and killed a bat.. OMG... A VAMPIRE JUMPED OUT OF IT!... and I nearly wet myself.. We got the key, then went back and worked our way up to the 5th floor and killed the wedding party until I got a ring. It wasnt the caster ring, but it was my first UBBER loot ever... it was also my first dungeon type crawl, and the first time to play with the BIG DOGS!  <br />
<br />
I stayed scared the entire time I was there.  By todays standards, it is just a zone to farm, but I will never forget my first time there.</td>

We made it to the npc camp and right away it started getting attacked by goblins.  I tried healing him, but he went down almost instantly.  I was standing there amid the NPC's watching as one by one they went down until finally there was only one left standing.  Somehow I survived the attack, but to this day I still remember it as one of the best NPC encounters I had.  At that time the game was still very astmospheric and surreal to me.<br />
<br />
Highhold Keep ~ Before I knew anyone that could port we used to make the run across Antonica.  Kithicor was still quiet and peaceful.  The one place that was like a gauntlet to run through was Highhold with goblins, orcs, and bandits along the way.  I remember being scared that I'd forget the way through.  I had a friend that gave me directions turn by turn.  I made it through at level 10 without a scratch, but boy was I scared.  I was bound back in Felwithe since I didn't have bind yet and didn't have the 2pp to pay someone for one in both Freeport and Qeynos.<br />

Fear ~ This was the first plane I ever broke and it was still a new thing on our server.  Just the hordes of mobs and the pure thrill of beating it.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My problem was, I was never scared *enough*.  I got turned onto EQ by a couple of RL friends at work, who played from Beta.  I resisted for about a year, despite their constant ravings, but finally started playing.  The graphics just blew me away from day one (yes...the pre-Luclin graphics...hahahaha) and I was constantly running around from zone to zone, just sight-seeing, and taking screen shots.  That came to an end when I died in Innothule Swamp one day.  After several failed attempts at a corpse recovery, I sent a /gu tell and asked for help.  One of my friends was on, with her Level 12 cleric, and she volunteered to help.  <br />
<br />
"Where did you die, again?"  "Innothule Swamp."  "Ummmm...I'm not sure where that is.  Show me."  And off we run, from Nektulos Forest, to EC, Nro, heading South toward Oasis.  <br />
<br />
Friend:  "Wow...you were a long way from home.  What level are you up to now?"  <br />
<br />
Me:  "4".  <br />
<br />
Friend comes to screeching halt..."4?!?!?!?!?!?!  What the hell were you doing outside of Nektulos?  You shouldn't even be *here*!!!"<br />

<br />
Friend:  "oooookaaaaaay...but I've never been down this way...I'm not sure I like this."  And on we continue, to Oasis, where we were both immediately squished by a wandering mob, camped at the zone line.  *grin*  This was repeated a couple of times, now with *her* corpses piling up alongside of *my* impressive piles.  She finally got pissed and logged on her mighty Level 22 Wizard, and we blasted our way through Oasis and South Ro and into Innothule, where we finally found my corpse under a couple of feet of water.  I thanked her profusely, and she warned me not to go to zones over my level any more.<br />
<br />
A couple of days later, similar situation.  I'm out sight-seeing again, snapping screen shots of mobs, just before they kill me, after which I run back and get my corpse...good fun for me, until I again get my corpse stuck where I can't retrieve it.  <br />
<br />
Back to /guild..."Ummmm...anybody available to help me with a corpse run?"  <br />
<br />
Helpful uber Level 30 Guild Officer:  "sure...where's your corpse?"  <br />
<br />
Me:  "Ummmm...I'm not sure what you call it...the zone where you ride the boat."<br />
<br />
Entire guild, screaming in unison:  "What?  You went to OT?  I thought Lyraic told you never to go to Oasis again!"<br />
<br />
Me:  "Hey...I didn't go to Oasis, okay?  I took the other boat.  The one that takes you to Vellious."<br />
<br />
Entire guild:  "*Groan*  OMFG, you are such a noob."<br />
<br />
The entire guild was assembled, to drag my level 4 butt out of Iceclad.  Mind you, this was a guild where the Uber-mains were mid-30s.  Not *too* many people died on the rescue mission. *grin*  (But, *man* I got some great screen shots! hahahaha)<br />
<br />
After that, I was given a final warning to stay in Nektulos until I hit 10, or I'd be deguilded.  Only took me another month. *chuckle*<br />
<br />
Edit:  (by the way...this story is about the early days of my main, who is now a level 54wiz, who was created about the same time as Vellious came out.  I was rereading this, and suddenly realized how odd it sounded, to hear a level 37 cleric talking about the good-ole-days before Luclin.  hehehehe)</td>

An uber level 40 something Ranger friend who had just gotten his Superior Camaflauge spell prceeded to fizzle like mad while trying to use it on my friend and me.  Needless to say this did not make me feel any better about running across this unkown snowy foggy zone.  He levied us and off we ran! I was feeling ok about this until I lost them both !!!  I was told to just keep looking up and running and if i got hit to just keep moving! .. omg i was totally breathless untill i hit that ice tunnel.</td>

back in the kunark days i made my first character... an enchanter... and learning fast i had to go to HHK at lvl 8 to get my new spells. Lucky for me i was told the opening hours for kithicor, so i would always sit around outside for long time periods. Especially after i found out about the stein of mogguk quest and the pp it could land me. Think that at lvl 12 i did it 20 times.. back and forth across antonica.. and always scared shitless of kithicor.... and every thing else since all zones could kill me soooo easy.</td>

Making and raising a new character just isn't the same as that first time experience entering an unknown zone.  <br />
<br />
I remember a number of zones that provided that "skeered" feeling and there are a number that I approach with caution today.  But the one that stands out for me as just a truly viseral skeery place when I entered it with my first lowbies in the 20s was Solusek's Eye.  Between the lava and the crazy goblins, especially the casters with their strange, eerie howling, the place was just a blast!!  Like a well designed spook house.  I still think it is one of the best dungeons around for a 20s group to learn dungeon crawling.</td>

Shazz has died to greenies a few times there, and it took me three attempts just to get to Gimpy's spot to camp so that he could do all the sit and wait...and he had one or two close calls then.

I also am VERY careful running through Paineel. Shazz had a mouse lockup one day coming out of the city and went a litle nuts looking for a Necro to summon his corpse...so now we all give it the ledge a wide berth and are very careful not to run too fast around it.</td>

Died 2 more times being rezzed before they dragged my corpse to the other side on the beach.<br />

But I really miss the early days.  Reading some of these post make me want to leave work and go home to play some more.  The days of exploration, wondering through new zones, trying to get to Qeynos form Freeport as a level 14 druid.  I miss that !  EQ will never be the same again.</td>

Im very adverntures, now that getting a corpse before you hit level 10 means nothing, i had fun making level 1 toons and hanging out running everywhere. I saw the accasional large creature, maybe something scary, but i'll always remember, my trip to naggy. I was level 46 beastlord (my main) and i was hangin out with some guildies when they said, "wel its time for raid", with my curiosity i said, "let me go, ill hold my own (i did)". Well to make a long story short, i poopied in my pants staring up at the large dragon Lord Nagafen. I was not killed, i was slaughtered. I got rezzed, and this time, i said WASSSUP NAGGY!! and she killed me again. SO another rez!! I was back for a third try along with rest of guild! i was feeling fine! feeling ready to fight! BAM- Im getting smacked around by naggy in the prep room! yea some stupid bard pulled her out on accident.. I turned around! Looked up at the super dragon! Smacked her for 2 pts of damage before i died. I was so proud. But i will always remeber the first time i walked through that scary zone to see that crazy dragon (since this time i ahve been on multiple raids and im no longer scared :))</td>
