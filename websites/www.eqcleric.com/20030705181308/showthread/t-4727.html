The second zone he spawns in is Ocean of Tears (OoT).  There he has a static spawn spot (but random spawn time) on the island across from Sister Isle.<br />

The AC in South Ro is noticeably easier (lower level) than the one that spawns in OoT.  Anyone can get the AC ring and Multi Quest the boots for you though.</td>

To fix your magelo  you need to enter in your skills for defence and dodge, and you mightr as wel enter in the others you still have 0s in. Aside form that you still have low AC items and hit hits hard and a lot.<br />
<br />
The bard will be able to do it easy, just chant kite it, that's how I use to do it. In the middle of the desert is a nice big "bowl" that a bard can run a circle in wide enough. Of course if you're there you can root and he can twist Bellows, Denon's and Fufil's chant. Making it go quick.<br />
<br />
The one in Ocean of Tears I was never able to make spawn. To spawn the one in Southern Ro, go to the side of the desert were it's starting to turn to green, if heading south, on the left you will find the top of a tower pointing out of the sand. In this tower a zombie spawns (I forget how often but it's about twice a Norrath day (which is 72 minutes) and he's only like level 8). You have to kill this zombie at night and only at night, I always waited till after midnight to make sure. Soon as you kill him one of the three named giant spawns will appear just north of the tower, you can't miss them. It seems to be random which of the three will spawn and none seem more frequent or rare than the others. <br />
If you don't get what you want then it's just a matter of waiting 72 minutes for midnight to come again and killing the zombie, etc. If you are a tailor there are cats and spiders in the zone you can kill while waiting. You'll just have to watch out for some goober coming by and killing the zombie or even worse, KSing your spawn.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I camped the AC in S. Ro for well over a month with my Necro.  My Nec was 44 at the time I was doing the quest, and <i>twice</i> I was KS'd by 55+ Druids.  I had my pet engaged, the AC dotted, and <b>bam</b> dead AC, no exp for my Necro, and NO RING!<br />
<br />
I finally did get the ring though, LATE LATE on a weeknight.<br />
<br />
The reason I tell this story is cause I <b>strongly</b> suggest you bring someone who can nuke with some authority if you are planning to camp the AC in S. Ro.  You may want to bring a Wizard or Mage as the AC in S. Ro seems to either be immune to fire based nukes, or has extremely high resistance to them.  <br />

Good luck with your quest, let us know when you finish! :)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Things I have found out regarding this quest:<br />
<br />
1) The AC in SRO is on the same spawn table as the pumas, it goes like this:<br />
Undead -> named undead<br />
Spiders -> terrorantula<br />
Puma -> SG -> named SG -> AC<br />
I can confirm this progression. There may be other ways to make him spawn, but this certainly does work.<br />
<br />
2)The AC in OOT spawns to 8am EST. I need to do much more testing of this, but I have confirmed that for the past 4 days he has spawned at 8am EST every day.<br />
<br />
3)If you are MQing the hand in you need to ensure that your MQer ONLY hands in the AC Ring. The person that wants the boots has to hand in the money (3250GP) and the Rapier as a minimum. I have confirmed this (dammit).<br />
It also seems that Hasten Bootstrutter will only stop at certain points, no matter how often you hail him. I have not yet confirmed this though and have not drawn up a map of the points yet either.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Sorry, but I'm going to have to get slightly rude here. Savyrass, did you even read my post? Your method simply does not work without the aid of serendipity. I went around reading post on this and found your method, tried it and it never ever ever worked. Ever! The spawn is simple and it is the only way it works. You cannot get Terrorantula to spawn except by killing the zombie. I guarantee you pulled the zombie and killed it while running around and killing everything else and so you *think* your cycle works. It doesn't! All your method does is frustrate people into not going after it at all and from what I have seen on most boards is propgated only to lead people form the truth so farmers can keep the secret, not to say this was your intent. <br />
<br />
The three names are spawned by killing the Zombie in the tower peak at night. PERIOD. It's simple, it's fact, and it's the only true method.<br />

In fact the only thing that comes close is the necro that spawns outside of the tower, but he also has no visible relationship with any of the "major" named spawns in the area.<br />
<br />
I had tried leaving the zombie until after 12am game time and all of the other suggestions you had mentioned with absolutely no results whatsoever.<br />

Did you really? Where did you find this and when did you try it? If you mean you tried it after reading it here I find that very hard to believe considering you posted your response less than 2 hours after I typed my guide.<br />

I have killed him one for my enchanter friend to get JBoots, which she now has. I killed him again so that I can get JBoots, but unfortunately we stuffed up the hand in (mentioned above) and now I need to kill him once more. I am not in this to farm, I am just pointing out what I have found to be true after speaking to MANY people, most of them who I trust and after reading many boards. You will notice that I have mentioned what I can and cannot confirm. Well, just in case you dont properly understand...If I say I have confirmed something, then I mean that I have seen it work at least once and I have more than one source to back up my beliefs. If something is not confimed I will say so meaning that there may be other factors involved (including blind luck) that I have not yet tested. EG the AC in OOT has spawned for the last 4 days at 8am est. But I dont know if he may be a 24 hour cycle that just hapens to be killed at teh same time, or a 12 hour cycle, there are more factors that could be involved there.<br />
<br />
The spawn cycle that I have mentioned in SRO, I have said I confirmed. I have seen it run once, I have run it once, I have seen it posted and have had at least 3 people tht I know tell me that it works. You say that it could have been influenced by others killing in the zone, but because of the timezone that I play in AEST, there are RARELY anyone else in zone, if so it may only be one other person. Sure, it could be blind luck, Ive heard others say that they have done nothing but sit in the zone and eventually the AC spawned. Who knows.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you have your opinion and that is fine, I have my opinion and you will respect that. Dont get rude at me because I offer TESTED alternatives. Instead go and get hard data and prove me wrong.<br />
<br />
Thank you</td>

*Disclaimer* This doesn't work 100% of the time, closer to 40%, but it's the most reliable method I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
1- Waste time until 7pm game time.<br />
2- Check in undead tower. two things need to be here in order for him to spawn.<br />
    A) The undead in tower must be up, and be a 'unique' mob like 'Desert Mummy' instead of the normal 'A Sand Mummy' or any other unique undead.<br />
    B) The necro outside the tower has to be alive.<br />
3- At 8pm kill the unique undead in the tower.. it seems to work more if he dies while still inside the tower, but that's just a feeling I have. Necro outside gets to live.<br />
4- Go to the top of a hill and make like a radar dish, if it was successful AC will spawn between 8pm and 2am, generally very close to the tower.<br />
5- Have a hotbutton "/o AC in engaged and going down." This limits the KSing, most people (on Vaz anyway) will just say grats and wait around hoping you die, don't.<br />
6- Go to RM and go insane waiting for stubby to spawn.<br />
7- Run out of RM faster than you ran in =)</td>

Sorry Maelarr, but Ive not seen him spawn with any relation to any of the placeholders. I dont think I saw the ogre at all last night.<br />
Heelar, Ill try out your SRO suggestions, but so far the only one Ive seen work everytime has been by killing the Pumas.<br />
I definately agree with Shadowfrost, it is a big advantage if you have track, and an even better advantage to use a Ranger that has the track sort options (put track on newest pop first and you will see the AC before anyone else).</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Killed AC in S RO 12 times now. I have tried every theory out there. Sorry guys, but it's just dumb luck. Just waste everything in the zone to occupy your time. He spawns when he wants! Period! Please don't be offended. Just telling you what I have seen tried and found out.<br />
<br />
I have camped the OOT AC 3 times and to be honest it's the only guaranteed AC kill out there. But is by far the most boring. I prefer the S RO AC since I can just walk around smacking the piss out of everything.<br />
<br />
Good luck those of you hunting him, as with everything in this game, patience is the key!<br />
<br />
*EDIT - Oh yeah one time my guild did a desert waste. We got him to spawn 4 times within a 1 hour period, and it was in the day time. We divided the desert into 4 sections and placed a group in each section. Now, let me say this, we were there about 6 hours before he spawned the first time, then BAM BAM BAM. So this shows it's dumb luck in my opinion.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have killed the the AC in SRO 3 times with my mage.  I was part of a 35 hour camp on OOT several years ago for the AC there.  I don't know for sure how they work but here is what I have gleaned from my experiences and thoughts on the matter.<br />
<br />
The AC in OOT seems to spawn about every 13 hours with constant killing of his placeholder.  In that 35 hour camp of switching off from different guild members we farmed 3 rings for 3 different members.  I was not one of the lucky ones...got tired and went to bed.  This info is from guild member...I was not there for even one pop.<br />
<br />
The AC in SRO is random but I think, like all mobs in this game are on a table of mobs all spawning in the same spot one after the other, like in a big chain.  His deal in this zone is that he has different spawn points.  I have seen him spawn next to the derv camp, next to the oasis zone, and in front of the little undead tower.  I do think that Sand Giants are in his spawn table as well as other smaller mobs.  I have seen undead, cats, and giants come from the same spawn points where I saw him spawn.  Sand Giants and other rare mobs seem to pop not long before he does.  Not that every Sand Giant is a precursor to his coming but everytime he popped it seems I had just killed one.  So leave enough mana to burn him down after a fite with a giant.<br />
<br />
The first time I killed him I just ran around the zone killing everything with my pet.  The horror, stinking bodies everywhere.  He popped near the oasis zone and i killed him with my pet and a few nukes.  I heard he was fire resistent so I used my Blades line to kill him quickly.  The crowd gathered quickly and some Ogre idiot tried to KS me and my pet, as if that were going to happen.  This took 2 hours.<br />
<br />
The second time I concentrated on only half of the sand area using the evil vendors as a divider.  Killed everything from the undead tower to oasis zone.  AC popped near the tower, I killed him and multied for an enchanter friend.  This took 1/2 hour.  I got real lucky.  Someone must have softened up the area for me.<br />
<br />
The third time I concentrated on just the back corner.  Anything around the derv camp.  My idea was that if he is coming out of any point.  I would just need to clear all the pops from a single spawn point to get him to pop.  The problem is that when they pop, they pop in multiples and they spread out all going in slightly different directions.  If you don't kill all 3, usually pop 3 at a time depending on which points you concentrate on, they will walk all over the zone until they despawn.  This will slow the whole thing down if this is correct. He popped near the derv camp. This took 2 hours.<br />
<br />
I may have been lucky on all 3.  I may be completely off base.  I do believe that the undead in the tower has something to do with the AC but only the one that spawns near the tower.  A friend of mine said that once there were 2 up at the same time.  That would support my theory of that there are several different spawn points and you really only need to work on one.  The problem is knowing where they are exactly and picking the one that has been worked on a little so you have less time to spend there.  What I mean is that if some one had been clearing the spawns in the tower for a while and gave up, when u come in all that work is done already and he has moved up the table that much closer to spawning.  <br />
<br />
I could be completely mad...but I have done it 3 times by myself.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">With regards to the OOT camp. I dont think its 13 hour rotation, 12 maybe, but not 13. Purely because for 4 days in a row he popped within 15 mins of the day before. On the 5th day e was 1 1/2 hours early.<br />
I dont believe you need to kill the placeholders at all in OOT. Reason is on the 5th day that I mention above I was camped for 4 hours beforehand and only killed one or two placeholders. Generally they despawn after 5 to 10 mins and respawn about 5 to 10 mins later. They can respawn as any one of the placeholders there.<br />
<br />
As for SRO, Ive given up trying to figure it out. I have heard and seen at least 3 specific ways of making the AC pop there and they all work. This may support your theory Norvik that there is more than one AC that can pop in SRO.</td>
