<br />
But I'm going to be a little different and change my answer to an Enchanter. We will both have to be grouped of course, but I think it's a partnership beyond the group or a team within a team. The Enchanter keeps me fed with mind candy which results in more heals for the group as well as <u>excellent</u> crowd control, slowing mobs which results in less heals, hastening melees to finish mobs faster and more. In return I keep the Enchanter fed with hit points/AC and healing, stun/root mobs that are a problem when the Enchanter is attempting to mez and even steal aggro from the Enchanter as I can take a beating a lot better. This is a partnership I cherish while grouped and I really think both classes compliment each other well. I make sure I take care of my Enchanter because he will take care of me.</td>

My second choice is to partner with a Necro friend of mine. Slap some serious buffs on his pet, then take a nap or go melee yourself some. Pet lifetaps to keep self alive some so seldome needs healing, and necro whines when you heal him.</td>

After them I would probably have to go with a warrior. DPS is usually not as good as pally/shadowknight, but they are still pretty decent.<br />
<br />
I have had great success partnering with a mage. You buff and heal the pet, and root the mob while the pet tanks and the mage nukes. The mage was using a fire pet. pretty effective combo. <br />
<br />
Have no comment about the necro, since I have not had the pleasure of duoing with one yet. However, based on what Phixin said, why would the necro even group if he and his pet can handle it by himself.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I don't have enough experience with my cleric to really have a firm or informed opinion, but...<br />
<br />
So far, my shaman looks to be a good partner (or will be when the cleric is old enough to actually group and team, not just use the shaman as a buffbot\healer)<br />
<br />
Both can tank fairly well and have good buffs to help each other out. Shaman is slowing the dinner and hasting the duo, cleric can chain stun or wade in knowing that the shaman can handle healing in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Probably not the best team in some ways (neither is a true tank, and neither is a true nuker), but probably the most versatile.<br />
<br />
I am also heavily weighted towards the necro or shadowknight idea. I actually created two new toons on FV for when I just feel like being alone and doing some casual destruction. Got a high elf cleric and a dark elf necro. I figure if I ever play them enough to make them truly helpful, I can offer them up as a Search and Rescue team. Necro can summon the corpse, cleric can rez. Of course, a shadowknight can track and summon as well, plus can tank a bit better, so may be a better choice if there are two players involved.<br />
I chose Necro in my case since I am two boxing when I do that, and can have the necro on the 'off box' with /assist /pet attack hot keyed, so I don't have to manuver him.</td>

The best exp can probably be had with an enchanter that does charms, but you usually need a third person to snare and inflict a hair of damage so the pet doesn't take it all. I also don't always find this to be the most exciting experience after you've done it once or twice. You want an interesting experience, try helping a wizard quad.</td>

I've had great luck with pairing with shamans and bards. With the shaman's slowing and debuffing ability, just about anyone can tank. If you get a good bard that song twists well and is used to grouping (which, alas, many bards are not), you both can easily harass mobs to death.</td>

They have the damage and utility you would require, they can hold aggro with no problems at all and can tank enough to be useful sure they dont have the AC and HPS that other classes have, but grouping with a cleric they dont need them. You can supplement the AC/HPS and heal with no worries of getting the MOB mad at you.<br />
<br />
Plus Track and snare are a godsend to a duo. In fact, a Cleric (who can fear anything) and a Ranger (who can snare, SoW and do huge damage) would be able to duo just about anywhere in the game without any real problems at all.<br />
<br />
I currently group mainly with an Enchanter and while its fun and has some advantages, its nowhere near as good as with a Ranger. The Enchanters pet sucks and charm is just not reliable enough.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well in my life as a Cleric, i must admit that i have partnered with Rangers mostly. As i got higher my main partner is a Mage.  My RL husband has a Mage and a Ranger both are really good depending on where we are hunting /duoing.  The ranger is great for the snare fear thing and his buffs, but depending on the mob i can use a lot of mana healing him.  While recently from Lvl 47 and above I find that the Mage is great his air pet is brilliant.  I cast aego on the pet and sit back and heal it, the mage does his 2k nukes and the mob is dead.   Its great.  We can now do the Ice Burrowers in WL it takes between 11 and 18 Complete heals to do it but it works.  I can heal the pet and not get agro from the mobs, but thats what i have found to work for me.  I still love the ranger but the mage is awsome as well.  Like i said it depends on the Situation and where you are hunting that the duo combo really works well</td>

If you were fearkiting with a Ranger you would theoretically use LESS mana. He/She would (or should) rarely need healing.<br />
Using a mage pet would use a lot more mana, you can't fearkite effectively as you dont have snare. Therefore the mage pet would have to tank the mob = less damage from melee and more mana used up healing the pet.<br />
<br />
I guess it depends on how good your partner is at playing each class. I know that I can fearkite Griffons in JP (Dk Blue at 52) with my Ranger all night with no KEI and no downtime at all.<br />
<br />
Also remember, your cleric has some wonderful stun/blinding spells that can be put to good use when duoing (or at anytime you have spare mana actually).</td>

<br />
at lvl 65 the whole partner thing is obselete especially in PoP if you want exp. i guess if you have a good beastlord on your side it is possible but it would take quite a while.<br />
<br />
Overall its hard to decide between SK/War/Ranger here it depends on what you want, i have taken paly out of the equation because alot of thier tanking has to do with using stuns and that makes the DPS horrible. if you go with a War your dps isnt very good but your safe with all that HP and you could hop in with a hammer if you want, the 63 hammer with yaulp 6 isnt too shabby. the SK will have more DPS and with his leech spells might not need heals too much either. Rangers are great dps with nice buffs for themselves, but are lacking in the HP area a bit.<br />
<br />
A good partner is an uber guild ranger =D. they tend to have around 6k hp buffed which is better than some warriors without the AAs. <br />
<br />
I love clerics but to be fair at higher lvls were not ideal partners without slow. put us in a trio and we wreck.<br />

ideal trio Ranger/SK, Shammy, Cleric</td>

Now in open areas and depending on pathing the fear thing is great but to be honest i dont usually use it as much as you think i might.

<br />
PoP High teirs - Duoing is laughable unless you have bots, Friend of mine a warrior, I a cleric bot a Mage and a Enchanter. This rocks, but Duoing with only 2? Ha, Enchanter or mage with a charm is the only real chance, its nice if you like risk....<br />
<br />
PoP Low tiers -  Slow is your friend, Bst, Shaman, Enchanter,  War/Rng with slow proc weapon.  Fear doesn't work on high level mobs but blind does.  Nice for gating or running for your life if the pet/ranger dies /yes <br />
<br />
Below that - I suppose it depends on your level.  For actual exp I have seen Cleric/Shaman duoing go far for instance in the Hole/Seb at 50-58.  Mages have powerful tactics, and so do Monks.  If you are above 60 then your choice here doesnt matter you're prolly farming I hope =/.<br />
<br />
40-55 I would say a Shaman+Cleric Duo could do more longer than many other combos, and do it all very safely, as in you won't die and lose the exp you were working on Hug your gate gems and let the pets take the fall.<br />
<br />
Some of this got deleted so I half-ass retyped it agrily! Sorry for what I prolly left out.<br />

AH YES! This was what I wanted to add and was left out.  I would have him do what he enjoys playing.  Then make your goal finding the best strategy with that class.  If you are creative enough you can make anything work ;) .<br />
