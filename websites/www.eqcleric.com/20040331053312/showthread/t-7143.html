I did so we had a little chat and he started saying he couldn't believe I was 51 now and how had I levelled so fast. I had a look and saw that he was 41, probably only a few levels on from when I grouped with him in DSP.<br />
<br />
Thing was I don't think I've levelled that fast. I'm by no means a power player, I usually play for around 15 hours per week and I've got to 51 in around 8 days playing time. Is that fast? I know it's not to slow but just wondered how it compared to the rest of you guys.</td>

I've got a bazaar mule, and the reason I have one is that it's much much easier to just log him in and type /trader then it is to get Raewyn, head to the bank, swap out all my packs for traders satchels and running to the spot and type /trader and then when I'm done and want to exp I need to head to the bank and swap everything back. Since I only play Raewyn it dont mather that I have a mule since I got plenty and plenty of free character slots.<br />
<br />
edit: Also I might forget to remove my satchels and put them in the bank when I'm done trading, and if I do I will be carrying to much weight so I cant move when I leave the bazaar, with a trader mule that is always in the bazaar I wont need to worry about that</td>

Helps to have one right there to pick up items and to do price checks anyway. Right now it is my 30 war. Not too bright but very strong!! <br />
<br />
Your leveling sounds maybe a tad faster than mine, Suzy. But as I said before, after 51 the leveling really slows down. But the bigger question is, are you having fun at it? Leveling quickly is not a great thing if you leave all of your close friends behind. And you are having trouble finding compatible groups. Some people however, enjoy the challege of meeting and playing with new people on a regular basis. <br />

As long as you are having a great time, nada dont worry!! hehe</td>

Now that i am grouping with other guildies in the same zones but they are lower then me theirs is zomming and mine is slow.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Greetings,<br />
I have partaken in both normal raw XPing and PLing. I think you can get a char to 50 in a matter of a few played days or less. If you started a char from scratch, I think you can make 50 in around 10 played days. I think it is based on player efficiency, dedication, skill, and knowledge. If you know the shortcuts, you can make 50 in 8 days (like you estimated). Also, "fast" is relative. I thought making 1 level a week was "fast" in 1999. Nowadays, "fast" is more like going from 60 to 61 in a few hours.<br />
<br />
Either way, just have fun and play at "your" pace.<br />

you can get 1 level+ in DL in about 5-6 hrs ( that is as of 3 years ago ).. i had a warrior that i leveled from 40-48 in DL. took a level a day.<br />
<br />
i PLd my cle from 8-40, then grouped in SolB for 41-47, 1/2 levels per day. (~ 8hr playing a day )<br />
<br />
it took me 3 solid weeks of nonstop duo'ing w/ my rog BF to get from 52-60. i went from 61-65 in 4 days in PoV ( lvl a day )<br />

my bard is 57 w/ 18 days /played. half of those were doing epic quest :\</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have 212 days of play time on Z. She was created July 2, 2000. She dinged 65 on July 5th, 2003. Five of those days at most were spend in the bazaar as a trader. The rest of the time I fought, quested, PLed my twinks and played the heck out of her.  I spend time fishing, and clearing orc camps for newbs, and sitting on the log in Nek forest buffing the little ones. I trudged through level 59 in Seb, duoing with an SK, because I hated PoP zones and I loved playing "steal the aggro" from him with my hammer and procs!  I didn't level fast at all. But I had great fun. I made tons of friends (I still talk to and group with folks I fought with in Blackburrow!!) I probably have set the record for taking the longest to reach 65. Ever. And I'd not change a thing about the way I've played. <br />

I usually average about a yellow a day, sometimes under. I expect it will take me at least half a year to gain the 11 more levels I need.<br />

My warrior on Vallon on the other time is level 42 with 27 days played - including all mess around time, AFK time and bazaar time. All the people I used to group with are raiding elemental planes now :(<br />

I am a notoriously slow leveller, just ask anyone in my guild - level 45 with about 7 or 8 days played is mighty impressive in my neck of the woods (cuckoo land).</td>
