<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hey I just wanted to say that some people may not agree with me on this but I want you to hear me <br />
<br />
out. Is buying pp really all that wrong? Most people will say yes and say that is crazy to spend 20 <br />
<br />
dollars for 20kpp or 50 dollars for 50k pp. It's "Just a game". You do not need to spend 50 dollars to <br />
<br />
play the game. However other people spend 12 hours plus a day playing the game trying relentlessly to<br />
<br />
 camp some item and lvl their guys. Some of them may not even work a job or only work part time.<br />
<br />
 While someone working a full time job could pay for 50k pp with only working 4 hours more than <br />
<br />
another and save all that time playing plus actually be ahead. That is just the beginning though. <br />
<br />
Whoever bought expansions like velious and LoY and LDoN etc.... is just as bad. You probably paid 20 <br />
<br />
to 30 dollars on an expansion. Why? Oh to have more fun. To get better gear because new expansions<br />
<br />
 normally means new gear and spells. Do you "Need" that expansion? No! You can get to 65 with <br />
<br />
Everquest classic and PoP yet most die hard EQ players own all the expansions. Think how much <br />
<br />
money you wasted when you could get to 65 with just 2. If you bought them all when they came out <br />
<br />
you have probably spent over one hundred dollars on them. And you don't need too. But someone <br />
<br />
having only EQ classic and PoP would be bashed for spending 20 dollars for 20k pp. That's crazy. That <br />
<br />
is not even the worst part though. I had an old cpu that I used to play EQ on. It is WAY out dated now <br />
<br />
though. With new expansions coming out my cpu could barely handle it and I definately could not use <br />
<br />
any of the new graphics. Well guess what . I bought a new cpu and now have all the good graphics. <br />
<br />
Why? Because it looks better I feel better. My old cpu could do all internet searching and homework <br />
<br />
etc... that I needed. So basically I spent 700 dollars on a new cpu to play EQ. Anyone who has bought <br />
<br />
an expansion or Especially a new computer has no right to say anything to anyone about buying pp. <br />
<br />
Also anyone who is on legends serever has no right because they spend 27 dollars extra a month to <br />
<br />
play on the server. That is about 50k pp every two months I could pay instead of the extra on the <br />
<br />
server. Paying for Allakhazam's? You don't need that. Just so you know yes, I have bought a cpu , yes<br />
<br />
 I have all the expansions, and yes I have bought 50 dollars worth or 50k pp over the internet. I have <br />
<br />
played this game since the month it came out and have quit 3 times for various reason's. The last time <br />
<br />
was for a deployment and when I got back I wanted to play again but gave my friend all my stuff and <br />
<br />
sacraficed my guy down to 45. So I had no stuff. This was a quick way to gear my guy and get rolling <br />
<br />
without all the tedious hours of play. So to wrap things up. PP duping is bad. Especially if someone is <br />
<br />
using it to sell. But buying pp, I can't say it is bad. And neither can anyone else who did anything like I <br />
<br />
said above.  Hopefully someone agrees a little bit with me on this.</td>

Enough said with that statement alone.<br />
<br />
Doubt your gonna find anyone to agree with you here Poppah.<br />
<br />
Beside the point Shadowfrost has made, supporting people who sale PP for RL cash only invites the same problems Diablo had by encouraging cheating. Once cheating is allowed to run rampant in EQ without some checks and balances, it will be the day EQ is over.<br />
<br />
As for what Jarvis said, he means that the whole thing is a huge bunch of letters all jumbled together making it difficult to read. Try breaking the post up into paragraphs. Hitting the "Enter" key will help ya out here. If you will look down in the right hand corner of your original post, you will see a small icon that has the word "edit" on it. Click that and break the post up a bit.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">okay.  you went overboard with the carriage returns.<br />
<br />
But, here is my opinion, as someone who very nearly bought platinum last week, because it's at an all time low, and all I really want in this stupid, electronic world, is a horse.<br />
<br />
PP buying is wrong because it encourages the real life EQ economy.  It is a violation of the EULA, and it encourages people to hack the game, because they can generate real life money from game cheating.  <br />
<br />
Look at it this way.  If you play poker with some guys 5 nights a week, and you pay someone... for sake of argument, lets call him... Yantis, who sits next to Sal, your arch-rival, to peek at Sal's hand and tell you when he's bluffing, is it wrong...<br />
<br />
a) if the game is just for fun?<br />
b) if the game is for bragging rights?<br />
c) if the game is for money?<br />
d) if the winner of the game gets to behead the loser?<br />
<br />
My answer is in all 4 cases.  You are paying money to a third party to break the rules of your game, in order to gain an advantage in the game.  This kind of dishonourable conduct leads to Sal deciding he needs to pay Yantis to signal you incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Soon, the game is no longer defined by who plays poker better, or by random luck, but by who is willing to pay more to the guy who is breaking all the rules in the first place.<br />
<br />
That is why buying platinum is wrong.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I wasn't complaining about having it, Restandre... I was tempted by the thought of it.  I thought "Hey, maybe just 10k... for $10 U.S. I could be riding on my majestic steed tonight!  And who would it hurt?  No one!  In fact, I'd be doing good!  removing platinum from the economy!  Sinking it into a vendor!  exactly where SOE wants it to go!  I'm sure even ABSOR would agree with me"<br />
<br />
And then my dumb ass woke up, thought about it as I did in my post above, and closed that webpage.  Forever.  Buying plat is Wrong.  Unequivicolly.  I don't care if you buy it to twink your 17th alt, or if you give it to the newbies of the world.  Or start a webpage to raise $1000 so you can twink out a little boy with Leukemia.   The plat sellers operate on supply and demand.  If there was no demand, they would not ruin the game with farming.  High scale, game breaking farming, cheats, dupes and exploits would exist but be less prevelant if people did not buy plat.  Because once you're level 65 and in mostly No Drop gear with all your spells... there's not a lot to do with plat, other than twink alts.   And how many times can you twink alts?  Like 10 before you have to start twinking guildies alts.  At some point you'll get sick of farming, duping, cheating or exploiting just for the fun of it.<br />
<br />
But at $10 per 5k... jeez.  If you got an easy way to do it, you do it.<br />
<br />
Again.  Plat buying is 100% wrong, and a bad thing for a good game.</td>

The "laissez-faire" attitude is very prevalent.  "Who cares what Bob does, as long as it doesn't affect me?" <br />
<br />
But the point is that it does affect you.  Whether you consider it in terms of my simplistic poker example above, or in terms of the proliferation and subsequent devaluation of plat, or you think of it in terms of Kant's Categorical Imperative.  Elsewise known as "What if *everybody* did as I am about to do?"<br />
<br />
Since EQ is an interactive game, the actions of all players have an effect.  Which means that what Newb_x does has an affect on you.  Furthermore, encouraging a 'meta-economy' based on money, gives EQ a dimension of value that means that you are likely to exploit it.<br />
<br />
Nobody ever got rich exploiting health bugs in quake.  Nobody ever got rich exploiting Aiming bugs in Half-life.  That is why those bugs do not ruin this game.  But somebody can get rich, in real life, off exploiting bugs in EQ.  While it is all well and good to say that these bugs should not exist, the same applies to detrimental overfarming and other anti "play nice policy" actions, and thus, the only way to prevent real life $$ from becoming the motivation for major interest in exploits, hacks, bugs, or other detrimental EQ practices is to totally discourage it's use.<br />
<br />
I stand by what I said.  Buying PP in EQ is wrong.  So is buying anything else which would encourage exploiters.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">First off im gonna start by saying, Yes i have looked on the net at the prices of pp and almost made the grave mistake of purchasing some.<br />
<br />
Well now time to spew my piece on this little topic and sit back too see what will be said.<br />
<br />
First off im gonna say that Selling PP from RL cash is garbage, as many people might have noticed the recent hyper-inflation of prices in the bazaar.  For example, a Copper Hammer of Striking used to go for 15-17k pp when i first started playing again, now go search for one in the bazaar and your lucky if its priced at under 22-23k, same for the Fungi Tunic when i started 40-50k was the asking price for it now its up to 60-75k and this all in a brief 2-3month span.  The question you have to ask yourself is What has caused this hyper-inflation to occur?<br />
<br />
It can be summed up to I feel 2 things, mostly it can be blamed on plat sellers and to a much lesser extent on LDoN. <br />
<br />
Ill start with LDoN since many of you will be asking WTF is he talking about :).  Well if you look since LDoN came out all the high level farmers can go in there with a couple of well-equipped buddies and if they dont mind taking the loss, in about 30 minutes or so fight their way to any named spawns (given they have a tracker) kill them, take the loot than rinse and repeat.  And on the rare occasion they can finish a dungeon when they get a supremly easy mission (Slaughter, Rescue) and get LDoN points too which they can use to buy augments to further upgrade their gear.  This doesnt sound bad in the first place until you go a look at it again, without these high level people off farming what they used to farm, the things like Ornate Patterns their has become a major shortage in the market place.  Ornate patterns whihc used to sell for a semi-resonable price have skyrocketed due to lack of people farming.  I cant remember the last time i saw an Ornate Boot Pattern in the market place or being OOC'd while im in PoK.<br />
<br />
Now to the major issue of PP selling.  The re-sale of PP for RL money is a MAJOR problem since it can be blamed as the major cause for the hyper-inflation of the EQ marketplace.  Since there is now so much plat floating around in the market place due to duping and other various tradeskill bugs.  With all this excess plat floating around, certain people have more plat to spend on that 1 item, which means that to ensure they get the item and with plat so easy to come by they can offer 20k instead of 17k for that Copper Hammer of Striking to ensure they get the item.  So now the people selling the CHoS say well i can get 20k for it so they do and eventually with the huge amount of plat people have thanks to buying it online they reach a new equilibrium price of around 25k.  This is happening to all the "elite" and fun droppable items in the bazaar.  You put them up for sale at an outragously high price and if you blink they are gone.<br />
<br />
Well all i can say is that if SOE doesnt want their first real sucess to crumble and die because the people who buy PP online are the only people who can afford anything, they need to pull their heads out of their ass and do something about it.</td>

<br />
And frankly I've never had much use for plat, I pretty much only ever used it to buy spells.  Clerics can create food and water, and there are a lot of nice quests set up in the game now, or drops.  Several years ago when I started on EQ, it was something very important but I haven't really given a gnomes behind about it (or loot in general) for years.  I play to have fun, and while ebayed jerks, idiots with gear they shouldn't have who were plvled to 65...do indeed put a damper on the fun of others.  I am personally very selective with who I group with, generally only inviting friends, or friend-of-a-friend situations.  This ensures that generally I don't have to deal with these morons (especially now that LDoN is out) and if I do, that's why I can disband and gate. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I just don't care I don't really have a use for plat and I never really did.  I'm not condoning people doing something illegal, I just don't have the time to get all worked up over the bugs in a game.  There are always going to be issues with exploits in games and yes unfortunately people can get rich through cheating.  As a person who will honestly and openly admit that they have (legally only) sold plat, items, and services to players on games (DAoC and Ultima) I don't think it's a wise choice, but if someone is going to pay me to do something I love and I am not cheating the game (it's legal and I use conventional [non cheat] means to procure what I sell) then I don't mind who chooses to purchase.</td>

I for one wouldn't play a game where that was condoned, especially a game where the advantages to be purchased are so great.<br />
<br />
I can't afford to be so selective about my groups as you, but I agree about the usefulness of plat, at least at lower and very high levels.  But the problem is that certain key elements available to our class (specifically the coveted spells in the 61-65 range) are impossible to get without raiding guild, or platinum.<br />
<br />
That means that the only way the casual (as opposed to hardcore) player can get these spells is generally PP.  Which means that many casuals turn to PP buying, which can and will lead to the devaluation of PP, which in turn inflates the prices of coveted spells, meaning that the plat sellers make money, and the honest folk lose.<br />
<br />
Can I do anything about it?  No.  Am I really all worked up about it?  No.  If I never get Armor of the Zealot, I never get Armor of the Zealot.  But do I hate pp buying in EQ?  Yes.  Just like I hate Enron-type book-cooking in real life.  It hurts people who don't deserve it.<br />

<br />
The bottom line is that SoE sells you the cds and the account and you rent time every month to play their game.  Any character above level 1 and any amount of money or gear on that account is yours though because you spent time getting it in some form or fashion.  If someone wants to make a business out of selling plat or characters or items then that is their prerogative.  <br />
<br />
The only thing you can shut down is the professional plat sellers which just opens the door wide for the individual scammers.  Not everyone can devote a great deal of time to this game and face it, xp groups and farming items is not fun for everyone.  If someone wants to pay real cash for plat or items then let them do it.  It doesn't affect you because if you've played clean and you've played well then chances are that you have a good enough reputation to get into a good guild that will reward you with no drop stuff and you can have the satisfaction of earning yourself.<br />
<br />
There will always be someone trying to cheat, hack, exploit, etc in these types of games and it's up to SoE programmers to be dilligent and defend against that.  The plat dupers got caught and banned and soon the server economies will be back to normal.  <br />
<br />
If someone wants to spend real cash to pay for the fruits of someone elses time I would say that is fair because the exchange of goods for services is as old as mankind.  If people are making money by cheating and scamming then I'd say that free market capitalism is being demonstrated in all it's glory.</td>

I don't know if you buy or sell plat, or if you never would, it is directed at a general "you" as those who would do such things, and at your points.<br />
<br />
The EULA specifically forbids the behavior.  The undesirable effect of having to "Keep up with the Joneses" in your possessions rather than your gameplay is a direct offshoot of this *forbidden* behavior.  Sony specifically has provided legal backup in all their licensing.  They didn't sell you the software, they sold you an account.  A Non-Transferable account.  Just because you feel like you created something in your time here, doesn't give you ownership of it.<br />

As I said, it is the 'laissez faire' attitude that inspired this behavior is exactly the problem.  Aside from the generalization that free market capitalism = scams and cheats, the heart of the matter is this:  EQ is not a free market capitalism.  The people who sell these characters, electronic items, or services are violating the rules of the virtual world they are part of.  They are violating the "Social Contract" of their universe, and are therefore immoral. <br />
<br />
Someone started this thread by saying buying PP is 'okay'.<br />
<br />
It's not.  It's wrong.  It violates the EULA, it violates the social contract of EQ.<br />
<br />
Saying that "someone else will do it anyway" is not adult reasoning, that's like saying "Someone was going to rob that bank one day".  Saying that "You can do it your way, still" is not logical reasoning, my ability to choose my behavior does nothing to elevate *your* moral behavior.  "This is the way it works in real life" is fallaciously applying the behavior of the real world to the microcosm of the EQ world.  And for the love of god, "it's more fun for me this way" is not reasoning at all.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that it is a failure to recognize, reason and act on moral grounds that causes people to buy PP.  I don't go so far as to condemn anyone who has ever done it, but I do think that if you reason as a rational and moral creature, you begin to see that it does nothing but overall hurt the game.<br />
<br />
Plus Croakes is right.  Sony said no.  It's their game, so stop cheating or they'll take their bat and their ball and they'll go home.</td>

As any player posting on eqauctions will tell you,  you are not buying the items, plat, or characters outright, you are purchasing the time of the player who obtained said items or plat and leveled that character.  <br />
<br />
Besides, End User License Agreements are just designed as a framework for the originator of the software to sue the hell out of anyone who violates copyright.  Selling the products of your time is not hurting anyone.  <br />
<br />
SOE is not concerned with people selling items, characters, or plat for real life cash.  If they were then they'd just start purchasing small amounts of plat from the people selling it and then ban those characters.  Since the only people they are banning are the people exploiting to duplicate plat it is safe to come to the conclusion that people selling the products of time spent in everquest don't concern them as much as people who are actually cheating.<br />

While SoE does say no in the EULA, they also are not earnestly trying to stop people from buying pp from the outside sources.  Just look at Yantis, hes been around long enough that they have to know who he is and what he does.  Heck if you search for EQ with Google or Yahoo he is one of the sponsered feedbacks.  So they gotta know that for them to get the plat and the accounts they had to log on at least once and click "I AGREE" to the EULA as we all do everyday.  I am not saying that buying accounts and plat is right or moral, Im just saying that if they really wanted this gone, people like Yantis would have already been sued and closed down.   Just look what DirecTV did, they bought out some of the hacking forums and such like MIRC, and have been sueing people left and right for using legal means to get illegal broadcasts of satellite TV.

Still, point is, even if the governing authority isn't stopping something that they declare illegal, doesnt' make it acceptable or condoned.

<br />
Ebay...apparently in the old days Verant came to an agreement with Ebay and because of this Ebay hunted down and deleted auctions that were related to EQ. I dont think SoE are interested in this anymore and so you may find some EQ related sales filtering through, but Ebay do still police it at times...thats what Ive heard and obviously I cant know if its true unless I was employed by either company (which I am not).<br />
<br />
EULA...again, just heresay, but didnt someone recently win a court case or something when SoE tried to get them in trouble for selling a character? I believe that they used the excuse of the person was paying for the time, not the actual character. Im very vague on this and will have a look and see if I can find more info on it.<br />
<br />
The only times you will find people getting in trouble for selling plat, characters, or other equipment is when it causes problems for SoE. Example. Person1 sells his account to person2. Person2 suddenly finds that person1 has stolen the account back and petitions SoE about it. SoE then says "oh thats against the EULA, and deletes the account". If the deal went smoothly, SoE wouldnt have done a thing. <br />
So you can conclude that either: A) SoE have so much other stuff to do (like creating events and such) that they cant police it properly.<br />
B) SoE cannot do anything about it legally, or<br />
3) SoE just dont care either way, until you try to inconvenience them.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Moonsorrow, in reference to your regular grouping situations...if you play a great deal, look up and make friends with people who seem like great players (from your random groups).  Eventually you can invite them to group and they will recripocate.  If you gather friends this way, and all play together and get to know one another you can often form a regular group.  People are willing to shift their time for EQ play hours to have a regular reliable group.  <br />

Especially if you are a home maker, and like me usually play in the early morning and then the evenings (taking the afternoon for all my cooking and housework) you find a lot of people in similar situations.  Evening hours are great too, since most people play at night.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">There seem to be a lot of flawed arguments flying around here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Argument: The sale of platinum is directly responsible for platinum cheats and hacks.<br />
<br />
This is obviously false. As mentioned (ironically in a post against selling platinum) other games exist that have no economy and no translation to American dollars. In these games (for example, Half-Life) cheats are rampant. I would go so far as to say they are on some order of magnitude more abundant than in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
We already know for a fact that people value EverQuest platinum as highly as they do the American dollar, at a certain ratio. Therefore, platinum must hold some intrinsic value to buyers (i.e. there would be no market if everyone was buying platinum with the future intention of converting it back to American dollars). People are willing to steal American dollars, it is therefore reasonable to conclude that people are willing to steal (hack, cheat) EverQuest platinum, regardless of relation to American dollars.<br />
<br />
Getting rid of the sale of platinum to American dollars will not halt the flow of cheats and hacks into EverQuest. I doubt it will even slow it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Argument: Buying and selling platinum hurts the EverQuest economy.<br />
<br />
How? In the arguments against buying and selling platinum, this is somehow taken as a given rather than a point that needs to be proven. If this holds true, then gifts of platinum would also be detrimental to the economy. We would have to argue that giving 5k to a friend to help him buy a horse is wrong. I doubt anyone here would be willing to argue that.<br />
<br />
In fact, the purchase of platinum ultimately reintroduces saved coin back into the economy. I know several high end players that are sitting on hundreds of thousands of platinum with no intention of doing anything with it. All their gear is nodrop, they own the highest end horse... what could they reasonably do with their platinum? Giving their platinum to a middleman who would distribute to players willing to spend that platinum would simply reintroduce coin into the economy that belongs in that economy. The fact that American dollars are exchanged and that the middleman is making real profit is irrelevant to the EverQuest economy. Certainly no one would fault a high end player going into the bazaar and giving away his money on a first come, first serve basis... why when American dollars are added to the equation is this suddenly an offense of morality?<br />
<br />
<br />
Argument: Buying platinum leads to a less skilled playerbase.<br />
<br />
Better platinum only means a player can buy better gear. This won't effect their relative skill level one way or another except in the natural consequence of faster leveling. To this end, the purchase of characters is much worse as the time to level is zero rather than just less. To illustrate this, how many of you, when meeting an extemely inept player that doesn't know the first thing about his class, assume that the person bought the character? How many of you assume that the person leveled the character from level one but with bought platinum which thus enabled him to level faster? The fact is, even without the problem of buying and selling platinum *or* characters, we will still need to deal with players who are twinked, powerleveled, or flat out don't understand the game. There is a solution to *all* of these problems, and it's very simple - keep an accurate list of people that aren't good at the game, and don't play with them. Introduce skill requirements to your guild. I guarentee people will stop playing this game when they are stuck on LFG for hours on end and can't get into a guild. If these steps don't sit well with you, then figure out some other way to discourage people from owning high level characters without the skill to support them... or stop complaining about this issue.  Eliminating the sale of platinum and characters would decrease the amount of low skill players at the high end of the game, but it won't get rid of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Argument: Buying and selling platinum is a breach of the EULA and therefore wrong.<br />
<br />
This has been brought up, but the exchange of platinum has, for a while now, been seen as an exchange of time.  When you buy 50k, you're buying the time required to farm it up, not the platinum itself. The platinum is just an expression of that time. It's a loophole. Of course, the consequence of closing this loophole, which however done would implicitly grant SOE ownership of your *time*, is unacceptable (I think this is a given).<br />
<br />
<br />
Argument: The "laissez-faire" attitude is ruining the game.<br />
<br />
I could really care less if people buy or sell platinum. This game, for me, will always be about large groups of people working together to achieve goals. I wouldn't even care if they decided to remove platinum from this game, make all wearable items no drop, and remove any semblance of an EverQuest economy. As long as I can get 50 people of like mind to log on and raid, I could care less how valuable my platinum is while it's rotting in the bank. I could care less if level 65 warrior A gives level 50 warrior B 100k platinum and an exchange of American dollars happens behind the curtains.<br />
<br />
It seems to me like the people most adamant against the purchase of platinum are themselves the ones that care more about loot and plat than in enjoying the game.</td>

I will however argue that there is nothing wrong with people who choose to spend real money instead of spending time "earning" plat.  I don't understand where all of the hostility comes from.  My biggest enemy in this game isn't talentless people who bought their characters because at least they have some gear that can sometimes make up for their own lack of talent.

They camp the items, so you cant.  Then they post the items for sale in the bazaar at inflated prices, which you can't afford.  So you are tempted to buy plat from them so you can give it back to their mule in the bazaar for the item that you could not camp because they were their first and will always be there. <br />

</td></tr></table><br />
<br />
The post you reference is my post.  The point you make is simply contraindicated by reality.  Cheater motivation in Half-life was usually motivated by one of two things.  Desire for fun, or desire for apparent skill.  Cheating in EQ is motivated by those two things AND the desire for money.<br />
<br />
Cheating in games where no real money is on the line, and the basis is not subscriptive runs rampant for the very simple reason that there is no incentive to stop it.  EQ has a player base to maintain.  Half-Life and Diablo 2 had *already* made their money by the initial sale of the box.  Therefore, EQ has more at stake, and slows cheating.<br />
<br />
I submit that if SOE did as only as much as Valve or Blizzard to stop hacks or cheats, then you'd have rampant cheating in EQ.  As it is, it's *hard* to cheat in EQ.  And because it is hard, the you need more motivation to go out and do it.  While I won't compare the relative situation of fun and desire, the addition of making money in the game is unlikely to *slow* the use of cheats and hacks.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, you argue, once again, that if people making $$$ didn't do it, someone else would.  This is a morally flawed argument.  If you shoot your wife, and then tell the courts that if you hadn't shot her, her father would have that night, then you're still guilty.  If you steal a pack of gum, and tell the courts that another kid was about to steal that pack of gum, you're still guilty. <br />

</td></tr></table><br />
<br />
There are several subpoints here.<br />
<br />
1) Selling platinum is no different than giving a gift of platinum.<br />
<br />
No one would argue that giving a friend 5k, or a random joe 5k, to buy his horse is wrong.  However, introducing money into the equation can, and is, a fair judgement of whether an activity is ethical or harmful to an economy.  <br />
<br />
If you give a friend 5k, because you like him, or you have no use for the 5k, that's one thing.  However, when you sell 50k to Yantis, for $45 to fix your dishwasher, or feed your starving somalian children, or whatever, you are giving it to him because what he gives you back is worth more in return.  Therefore, it creates a reason for you to generate more money than you need for the game, or all your friends, or even everyone you've ever grouped with.  Because while you'd get sick and tired of farming a 250kpp item if all you were gonna do is give out 5k to every newbie in Gfaydark, you will not stop doing the same farming, exploit, cheat, hack, or even simple honest money making if that 250kpp is going to be half your rent check for the month.<br />
<br />
Selling platinum makes platinum valuable much higher quantities than the game mechanics do.  Thus, more platinum is introduced into the economy.<br />
<br />
2) Selling platinum reintroduces coin into the economy, which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
This is a *very* complicated economic principal, which I am not fully equipped to address.  But I can say one thing to this statement.  <br />
<br />
While it is not inherently false, it is likely, that on the majority of EQ servers, the economy is one of consistent deflation.  Consistently deflated economies DO NOT need more currency.  <br />
<br />
They need less.  Less of something is more valuable.  The less valuable platinum becomes, the more out of reach items traded between players become to those who are not already rich, and are not participating in the illegal or unethical methods of platinum gathering.<br />

<br />
I agree with you here.  Buying platinum does not affect the level of skill you have.  It could, ab reductum absurdo, have an effect on the playerbase as a whole, but I don't think it's a significant effect of the platinum trade.<br />

Exchange of time arguments are fallacious from their outset.  Imagine this:  I work for an engineering company.  While I work for this engineering company, I specifically sign a document that says any innovation I make that is patentable becomes their intellectual property, as long as it is relevant to their business.   I spend time at home sitting and thinking up an innovation, and then go sell it to a competitor or an outside party, without their consent.  They sue me, and I defend myself by saying "Hah!  I didn't sell their innovation.  I sold the time I invested in making that innovation!"<br />
<br />
The argument may be a legal loophole, but legal loopholes have very little to do with definitions of right and wrong.  <br />

I don't believe I said quite that it was ruining the game.  If I did, i should be more specific.  I meant that it is ruining the game economy. <br />

And it seems to me that you went to great length to defend a practice that you do not care about.  But, more on the point, you're wrong, I care a great deal more about enjoying the game than about loot.  I probably spent 2 hours posting on this topic, all told.<br />
<br />
But I've spent countless hours enjoying EQ and making friends.  I don't have a horse, I've never touched a flowing thought item, and my best gear is all gifts from my wonderful family guild.  So saying I am a greedy loot-lover is a bit of a low blow.</td>

One thing I will comment on is the comments regarding Laissez Faire. Letting businessmen do whatever they want doesn't work. This was the prevailing thought toward the beginning of the 20th century in the U.S., and it led to tycoons that over-worked and under-paid their employees. There were countless shysters hawking magic potions, and horribly ill-produced products from "legitimate" businesses...notably the food industry. I know there are probably some Adam Smiths out there, but I disagree horribly with letting business do its own just in principle. How you apply this argument to EQ is up to you, but there needs to be some measure of control.<br />
<br />
At the very least, the issue of counterfeiting money (i.e. plat duping) should be squished on very hard, and has been addressed as of late. There are still plat sweatshops out there though, where people have a non-stop crew farming guard in Seb at some pittance wages. I don't want to know exactly how Yantis sub-licenses his clients' orders, but I'm sure he isn't sitting on Stormhammer leveling all these characters himself.<br />
<br />
More to the point, Everquest is a game, not a job. The only people who should be earning money from it are the people who are responsible for creating and administering it. I'll extend this to people who offer a legitimate service like Allakhazam, who I put on the level of, with it being far less of a waste of money, Prima's so-called strategy guides.</td>

<br />
I'll start by saying that the purchase or sale of platinum does not hurt me personally.  Without ever purchasing or selling pp, I've reached that stage of the game where there is no item or spell in the game available in the bazaar which would be an upgrade to my character and there has been no such item for months.  The only reason why I'm not sitting on an enormous pool of pp is my tradeskill habit and the fact that I've stopped worrying about reagent costs.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I have no personal axe to grind.<br />
<br />
I'm a former officer of a raiding guild, who's moved to a guild at a much lower level of achievement because my new guild is focused on roleplaying rather than raiding and that's what I enjoy.  I know people who have purchased EQ items for RL money.  I know someone who purchased a Sleeper's Tomb key for several hundred dollars, and someone else who purchased an Ornate Breastplate mold although I'm unaware of the price.  For rather smaller amounts of money, I've seen many others purchase things like FT3 boots, Staff of Flowing Water, and whatever.<br />
<br />
I've also seen the kind of person who will farm a Sleeper's Tomb key or an Ornate Breastplate mold.  They tend to be prepared to act very discourteously towards other people, sometimes even training or KSing in order to ensure that they get this week's EQ items sale paycheck.<br />
<br />
I'll repeat that this doesn't hurt me.  The content that I'm interested in is instanced so there's no possibility of training or KSing anyway.<br />

<br />
Half-Life and its counterparts are patched regularly to avoid player hacks. This is to maintain a reputation among the community. Without a solid reputation, sales for Half-Life 2 (or its counterparts) are apt to suffer. Regardless, without any hard data, neither one of us has a solid foundation here. Because EverQuest has the added impetus of economic gain, I grant you this argument, with prejudice, read below.<br />

If you steal a pack of gum, and tell the courts that another kid was about to steal that pack of gum, you're still guilty.</b></td></tr></table><br />
<br />
As an absolute moralist, this was the furthest from my intention in arguing. Hacking and cheating *are* wrong, I was only trying to observe that the buying and selling of platinum was not solidly linked to encouraging them.  In addition, I was arguing that because of the very fact that the American dollar and platinum have an exchange rate, platinum has an intrinsic value to certain people that would encourage hacking to the same extent that taking the American dollar out of the equation would.  Herego, the encouragement of cheating is related not to the American dollar, but rather to platinum itself, and the link is broken.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, and again as an absolute moralist, you have yet to show that buying and selling platinum is a morally wrong action in and of itself.  Because the purchase of platinum encourages cheating does not make the purchase inherently wrong.  Likewise, pushing someone down a set of stairs does not imply that stairs are morally wrong.  Knifing someone does not imply that knives are wrong.  Shooting someone does not imply that guns are wrong.  The fact that people abuse heroine does not make heroine wrong.  Until you prove that person A selling person B some amount of platinum is wrong, the fact that it encourages cheating, while practically significant, is morally irrelevant. However, continue reading, I have more to say on this at the end.<br />

Therefore, it creates a reason for you to generate more money than you need for the game, or all your friends, or even everyone you've ever grouped with.  Because while you'd get sick and tired of farming a 250kpp item if all you were gonna do is give out 5k to every newbie in Gfaydark, you will not stop doing the same farming, exploit, cheat, hack, or even simple honest money making if that 250kpp is going to be half your rent check for the month.</b></td></tr></table><br />

Again, the fact that buying and selling platinum encourages people to play the game does not make it morally wrong. See above arguments, I believe they all hold here.<br />

2) Selling platinum reintroduces coin into the economy, which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
This is a *very* complicated economic principal, which I am not fully equipped to address.  But I can say one thing to this statement.  <br />
<br />
While it is not inherently false, it is likely, that on the majority of EQ servers, the economy is one of consistent deflation.  Consistently deflated economies DO NOT need more currency.  <br />
<br />
They need less.  Less of something is more valuable.  The less valuable platinum becomes, the more out of reach items traded between players become to those who are not already rich, and are not participating in the illegal or unethical methods of platinum gathering.</b></td></tr></table><br />
<br />
This is true. I stand corrected. More platinum introduced into an economy will drive prices up, and since "wages" at the bottom level are fixed (monster coin drops and platinum loot) this will drive items out of range of the bottom most players. However, I would argue that this is a problem with SOE not balancing the NPC->PC, PC->NPC economy, rather than "rich" players reintroducing honest money back into the market. It is not the responsibility of rich players to hoard their money to protect the economy.  And yes, I grant that this is also a problem of hackers and exploiters accelerating the rate of NPC->PC income.  However, see above argument on the morality of buying and selling platinum.<br />

<br />
The company you work for does own your time. It pays for it.  If SOE was providing you with an office, and a computer, and an internet connection, and a salary, and you used all of these during off-hours to make platinum for personal gain, this argument might be more valid.<br />

As a further irony, I'll now disprove all my own ramblings. The purchase of platinum is, all by itself, cheating (thanks Urry). A player receiving platinum due to influences outside of game rules is unacceptable. It could be equated (for the roleplayers out there) to paying the DM American dollars to have your character happen upon some campaign treasure. If cheating is wrong (and I believe it is) then buying platinum is wrong.<br />

Here I will totally and wholeheartedly agree with you.  PP buying is not bad because it is a waste of money.  People can roll their money up into cigarettes and smoke it for all I care.

Buying/Selling Plat for RL dollars is a vilotion of the EULA, and thus a violation of the game. If you do it you break the rules of the game, ie, you are cheating.<br />
<br />
If buying/selling plat is cheating, and cheating is wrong, therefore, buying/selling plat is wrong.<br />
<br />
It's about as basic as that.<br />
<br />
As far as a couple of other things. The plat duping schemes can be considered the equivelent of counterfeiting. In effect what these people were doing was counterfeiting Platinum. The reason the EQ economy got screwed up was because a mass amount of counterfeit cash was introduced into the economy. This follows the theories of many economic principals. Ask any economist and they will tell you that a mass influx of counterfeit money into a capitalist economy will devalue that dollar and cause mass inflation in prices. SOE had to step in, just like the US Dept. of Treasury would step in and squash anyone counterfeiting the US dollar.<br />
<br />
As to why SOE does not squash someone like Yantis? Ask your self this and you will find the answer if you are a logical thinking being: In order for Yantis to do what he does, how many accounts does he hold on each server? And how many servers are  there? And how many others like Yantis are out there? You do the math and it all adds up to one thing. $$$<br />

<br />
Ok gonna steal the thread for a moment here. First let me say I respect and appreciate what your brother does for a living. However his statement is DEAD wrong. Laws like riding a bicycle while drunk were made because some dumbass rode his bike drunk and either got himself killed or someone else, or has done some extreme damage to public or private property or the potential for such a thing to happen is greatly increased while operating any form of transportation while intoxicated. Example: a few years back a man was riding his horse along the side of a highway while intoxicated, his inability to think clearly caused him to make a decision to ride across the road without looking before he turned. In doing so he caused an accident that sent a family to the hospital and destroyed their vehicle. The man on the horse was charged with DUI and convicted. Sounds crazy I know, however, it can clearly be stated his alcohol consumption was a direct cause of the accident and therefor cannot go unpunished because you or someone else thinks it's ok to operate a horse while drunk in a public place.<br />
<br />
Second point, while there are some whacked up laws out there, most were created because the potential for something greater was there. Laws are created for the protection of the public. NOT to give Law enforcement the right to Harrass the public as your brother wants to imply.<br />
<br />
Now with that said, let me say this, there are some laws I do not agree with nor do I think are fair. However, as an officer of the law, it is not my right to decide what is fair or right but to enforce said laws. And on that point, let me say this also, a Police Officer has the right to exercise something called "Officer Discretion" which is a lose lose situation for a police officer and whole different can of worms. This whole thing is a BIG can of worms that can be argued till we are all blue in the face, but I felt I had to speak up and make clear that your brothers original statement was flawed.</td>

<br />
Prices have been going up for three reasons.<br />
1) There is more money being created than spent. This has always been true. There isn't much that can be done about this without nerfing drop rates on mobs.<br />
2) Plat duping. Self-explanatory.<br />
3) Farmers. This is somewhere between the two above. Since the introduction of selling plat, farming EQ currency and items has become about more than just killing giants in Rathe Mountains to save up for a Spirit Tome. Players go out of their way, beyond the extent they did previously, to try to acquire massive amounts of platinum, because it does more for them than simply being rich in Everquest.<br />
<br />
Farming items is perfectly legal, but there is something inherently wrong with paying a team of people to take turns working a group of character in Sebilis to mine the gems from scarabs there. Farming items is strictly about exchange-of-hands. People sending their private teams to Sol Ro Tower to farm Ornate molds, while I find grievous, is really only annoying. Making massive amounts of pp directly from mobs and selling their drops to vendors has been making prices go up perhaps more than the plat duping has. (Only because it has existed for a lot longer, and anyone knows how to farm pp.)<br />
<br />
Every time I see a "how does a cleric make money?" post on these boards, there are two kinds of answers. Get items players can use, mostly tradeskill-based, and farm XX place to make the money from coin and merchant fodder. I can't attack people that do the latter because everyone has done it at some point, but they do it for their own EQ purposes, not for RL money. Saving 20k this way for a Hierophant Cloak is a game goal, something to work for. Saving 20k to pawn off on the black market is not.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that the farmers are only selling Fungi Tunics and Earth bows that they acquired, then ask where people get the money to pay for them. Either they bought it from whoever the farmer sold their last pp payment to, or they went out of their way to add the pp to the economy themselves killing Hill Giants...which they will do far more than they would have had to due to previous inflation.<br />

A SSoY is no longer a "high level" item though. It has become devalued, because it is obsolete. Newbies that have "uber" gear, by today's standards, are twinks.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, players have come to consider newbie-ness to last to a higher level these days, because it is easier to get to 60, with today's items, spells, and other benefits in the game, than it was during Kunark. I could possibly call someone that is level 57 a newbie. (I won't, I think that's wrong, but some players would.) To talk about new players and their needs is to talk about spell drops and items almost on par with the Velious armor that people were oh-so-uber to have before Luclin.<br />
<br />
My ranger is a well-equipped twink. She's level 34, but it would not be unreasonable for a player to have *most* of her equipment by level 55-60, depending on how financially-oriented they were. So let's pretend that she's a level 60 noob. I went to the bazaar yesterday, and there was absolutely nothing I could buy that would be even a minor upgrade for less than 10k. Mind you, I'm not rich enough to afford 10k items on all slots on my twinks. Some of the items I would have once thought about acquiring now cost over 50k. How long would it take a level 60 person, new-to-game, without a lot of resources at their disposal, to earn 50k?<br />
<br />
Depending on their best known method of earning plat, maybe longer than it would take to earn $50 flipping burgers.</td>

Its been a long time since college and my Keynsean etc is more then a little weak, but some of these statements about the EQ 'economy" seem way off base. This is a totally manufactured environment, and supply of anything is theroetically infinite, no? including platinum... demand is created by players wanting 'uber' gear, and that is only as good as the next patch, or expansion, I dunno, like I said any economists out there who can give a more inteligent slant to this? Whether you get platinum off drops or by buying, it still exists, and sticking it in a bank and sitting on it isn't creating an artificial shortage against inflation (ow, i think i just sprained my frontal lobe.... thats euff about this)</td>

<br />
1) What is your word worth?  You click "I ACCEPT" each and every time you play to a EULA that forbids plat buying and selling.  So.  You said you wouldn't do it.  If you sell or buy plat, what is your word worth now?  Well?  Let me tell you what it's worth.  Zip.<br />
<br />
2) Plat buying supports plat farming.  Don't come whining to me about high-cash areas and highly-desirable items being perma-camped if a) you also go around saying plat buying doesn't affect you, or b) you've bought plat.<br />

The first point is the most important to me.  My word is worth more to me than pixels on a screen.  Is yours?</td>

Until you prove that person A selling person B some amount of platinum is wrong, the fact that it encourages cheating, while practically significant, is morally irrelevant. However, continue reading, I have more to say on this at the end.</td></tr></table><br />
<br />
I read on, and I understand the ultimate conclusion you came to below, but I wanted to address this point.  The fact that it encourages cheating is both practically significant and morally relevant.  If we accept that cheating is an immoral behavior, and we accept that to encourage or facilitate immoral behavior is, itself, immoral, then we must accept that buying platinum, even if it is not, of it's own essence, immoral, it is immoral because of the effect it has.<br />
<br />
To use your own example, saying that People abuse heroin does not make heroin immoral.  However, I propose, and assume that without extensive argument it can be accepted, that the actions of producing, transporting, trafficking and selling heroin are immoral because those practices encourage immoral acts.  <br />
<br />
Causality is a train I prefer not to derail, so if you do not accept that heroin abuse is a direct consequence of heroin production, transporting, trafficking and sales, please just say so.  At some point we have to say that A causes B.  I am willing to accept that without A, there would be no B, so therefore A causes B.<br />
<br />
<i>EDIT: I read this and realized while it touches on one of your examples, it leaves alone the thornier issues of guns and knives.  Furthermore, it reads as if it simply overtakes them.<br />
<br />
Without getting into a discourse on gun control and the morality of weapons, I submit that murder is possible without weapons, where drug abuse is not.  And while shooting is not possible without guns, and stabbing without something sharp, these are implicitly different because of the element of *choice* that is part of their use.  Heroin, and indeed, any addictive drug, contains an innocence followed by a compulsion which is more significant, and easier to assert the immorality of the precedents.<br />
<br />
However, getting back to all of this, it means that I have disproved myself.  PP buying is not implicitly wrong because it does not *necessarily* compel more cheating.  Free choice is equally at work here as it is in the distribution of knives and handguns.<br />
<br />
Jeez.  If anyone else can follow my arguments, please say so.  They're starting to no longer make sense to me.  This is what happens when you type as you think.</i> <br />

The purchase of platinum is, all by itself, cheating (thanks Urry). A player receiving platinum due to influences outside of game rules is unacceptable. It could be equated (for the roleplayers out there) to paying the DM American dollars to have your character happen upon some campaign treasure. If cheating is wrong (and I believe it is) then buying platinum is wrong.</td></tr></table><br />

Heh, I enjoyed reading your whole post, Varyx.<br />
<br />
The point you make here, at the end, is, to my mind, the crux of the matter, and that's the reason my very first post in this thread had to do with it.  However, I was attempt to do more than simply assert that cheating was wrong and that pp buying = cheating.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I was trying to couch it in terms of an overall moral imperative.  <i>Why</i> is cheating wrong?  It is wrong because cheating, in a competitive environment, necessarily begets more cheating.  <br />
<br />
I believe at this point, Varyx, to proceed any further in our conversations, we'd have to begin to establish such questions as "What is morality?"  <br />
<br />
Is it the violation of an implicit social agreement?  Is it behaving in such a way that retards pleasure and enhances pain?  Is it behaving in a way that, if the categorical imperative is applied, would bring the world to a halt?<br />
<br />
I thank you for a very interesting point and counterpoint.<br />
<br />
I'm glad that at the heart of it, we agree.  And I look forward to another discussion springing up where I can exercise my underutilized philosophy muscles.</td>
