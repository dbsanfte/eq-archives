Others may feel differently, but I don't think you can ever go wrong with the Alteration route as a cleric, but if you do decide you made the wrong choice you can always do the Solusek temple quest to reset it so you can change your specialization.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The possible specializations are:  Evocation; Alteration; Abjuration; Conjuration; Divination.<br />
<br />
You can dismiss conjuration and divination out of hand; nobody ever ran oom from summoning hammers, food or drink, and nobody ever ran oom casting flash of light and invis to undead.<br />
<br />
Abjuration would reduce the mana cost of your most expensive spells (e.g. Hand of Virtue at 2.5k mana a cast) - but the truth is that most of the time when you're buffing, you have the chance to med up again afterwards.  And in any given hour of playing you generally use a lot more mana healing than you do buffing.  So that's out.<br />
<br />
Evocation would reduce the mana cost of your nukes.  But if you made a cleric in order to nuke people, I really suggest switching classes.   Nuking is something we do when we have surplus mana - it's not our core role.  Evocation's a good one to choose for your Secondary Forte but it's not a good choice as your core specialization.<br />
<br />
Alteration reduces the mana cost of your heals - including CH.  (Specifically, if you specialize in Alteration as opposed to Evocation, CH will cost you 8% less mana per cast once your specialize skills are maxed out).<br />
<br />
I believe that all players of clerics should choose alteration as their specialised skill.</td>

You don't need to tell me why to go alteration - believe me, I know.  I just wasn't sure if AA and all that hoohah had changed things any in the end game - I refuse to have to redo my specialization because I didn't bother to ask ahead of time =)</td>

Funnily enough, my druid was a pretty good cleric substitute back in that day, but I decided not to pick her back up as I didn't want to be "unguilded, formerly retired, out-of-date druid_348974365."<br />

<br />
I will also support her suggestion that Evocation is a better secondary forte than Abjuration, although I can understand the argument against. My basis is this, though: the amount of mana you will spend on Abjuration spells is fixed. You cast HoV once and you should be done with Virtue until somebody dies. The only spell you might cast repeatedly is Vie. The rest have a set amount of mana they cannot exceed (within reason.) Evocation otoh is what you do with mana you don't need for healing. You can possibly go completely nuts here; I go oom more often not paying attention and nuking than I do from actual healing in some groups. Since I'm actually contributing something that doesn't have a fixed value, I'd rather contribute more.</td>

The last time I played a cleric, level 50 was it - that's all she wrote, folks, end of game, stop here, don't pass go, and don't even dream of getting past island 5 in PoSky.<br />
<br />
The game changes, and so do strategies - if current wisdom was that you want to go conjuration with a cleric, I'd at least like to be aware of it.  Of course, if that was the current wisdom, I'd question everyone's sanity too, but I would polietly listen to the arguments first =)<br />

Second one is a bit of a toss up.  After rebuffing group after two wipes last nights kind of wished for Abjuration, but I often use nukes for kills shots on runnnin or gating mobs and when I have mana to spare so Evocation is where I think I am headed.<br />

To each their own I think,  after alteration of course. :D</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Like everyone said Alteration is really the only choice for a clerics specialization. Your going to spend ALOT more time healing than buffing. As far as a Second Forte really a toss up. With Virtue.Aego.Temp line we really only cast 1 buff (Well spell haste and Guard of Vie lines) so we get little use out of specialization Abjuration. Evocation depends on how often you find your self in a position to nuke/stun.<br />
<br />
Since I'm in a raiding guild. I'd probally end up going with Abjuration as menitioned before people die on raids and the faster they are rebuffed the quicker the raid can progress.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">well for your first specialisation there is only one choice, alteration.  Clerics do one thing well and one thing only ( for the most part)  and that it heal.  <br />
<br />
for my SF i will chose abjuration just because typicaly on raids ill be casting symbol, DI,  BoV, spell haste almost constantly during the raid it will save me a lot of mana,  ESPECIALLY since spell casting mastery 3  works with your specialisation to make it even better.  for me nukes/stuns are NOT something i mem very often.  Maybe I'm oldschool since i came out before hammers and such but I am far more comfortable with the role of sitting and medding and gettin up to heal and sittin back down.  I nuke only when im bored</td>

no...i kid...alteration is the way to go, however, SF I would go evocation, cuz i tend to nuke alot, and like someone said earlier, I always have time to regen my mana after I do a massive buff or anything of that sort<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello all,<br />
I now see this as a debate between: raiding versus grouping. If HoV costs 2500 mana, and you cast it constantly during raiding, then wont you only save 8% if fully specialized in abjuration? So, that means you saved a mere 200 mana. Wouldn't it make more sense to build a character as if you were to play solo/group and not entirely dependant on one philosophy/paradigm? Or do you always plan to "play to raid" and nothing else. When growing up I always thought of Clerics as "battle types", but after playing EQ, I now see them as the "purest" healer in their class. I guess if you are overmatched for your opponent, then you can jump in with your hammer and put some dps in, but I enjoy battles where I have to really think and focus my heals at the exact right moment. The game is more thrilling, when the odds are close - imho.<br />
<br />
Either way, have fun playing your Cleric.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">One of the best things about EQ is choice.  One of the even better things about EQ is the ability to customize not only the way you play your toon, but also the way your toon looks.<br />
<br />
As a cleric, there are many choices available to you.  You can choose to be a melee cleric and not worry about ANY raiding.  You can choose to be a raiding cleric and have the ability to melee and "mix it up".  You can also choose to be a healing Cleric (read 2 years ago, you sit on your butt all the time, doing nothing else)<br />
<br />
There are MANY in-between stages and opportunities.  These are some basic setting for how you want to grow your toon and help you decide on what you want out of the game.<br />
<br />
Generally, a person chooses their AA's based on decisions to choices exampled above.  Secondary Forte is nothing more than another choice :)</td>
