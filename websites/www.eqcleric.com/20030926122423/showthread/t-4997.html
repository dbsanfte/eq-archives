No such luck for me.<br />

PH #44 was a Large Fire Goblin at 0630 this morning.<br />

Considering I killed #43 at 2325hrs last night, I'm guessing he was the replacement at 2345hrs...there was only one other person in the zone when I left, and I doubt anyone came through over night.<br />
<br />
Ah well. If I don't get lucky tonight, I'll prolly bring my game box in tomorrow and camp it from the office. If I can make enough space for a second monitor and poke whatever holes I need in the firewall, that is. If not, it'll prolly be 'Work from Home' Wednesday.</td>

Good luck. Bring a book and a stack of DVD's. If you kill him with less than 40 PH's, I don't wanna know! /smilewink <br />
<br />
I'll be back to leveling Duhikae now until he can group for XP with Shazzog...then we will head off to Lake Rathe for the next long, boring camp.<br />
<br />
When he hits 40ish, we will go park ourselves in Skyfire for shards and XP, as we should both be able to XP there (though Shazzog will, no doubt, be set to 100% AA by then, waiting for Duhiakae to catch up)<br />
<br />
Once I have all the 'solo' stuff done, I'll gather the guild and allies and head off for the rest. May have to level and faction someone to help with Chardok, though...I hear that makes things easier if you can CoH the group in.<br />
<br />
and Congrats on 49!</td>

I was one of the unfortunate Clerics to be at the Epic stage when RF was on a week spawn rate. I Sat  there for 2 weeks last summer. Soo boring GMs came to the zone everytime he was due to pop just to mediate the guilds there to keep fights from breaking out. Was no fun at all. I had totally said screw my epic. After watching 3 others get theres as no one in my guild wanted to stay in zone so long to show force at all times. <br />
Needless to say Verant finally changed the end quest and 3 days after patch I got my epic :-) <br />
So moral to this is hold you head up it could be worse  :-)</td>

Bwah! Overkill, much? /smilewink <br />
<br />
My second night there I was able to chat and 'compete' with a 54 Mage trying to get his epic drop. Between spawns, he would wander around slaughtering pretty much everything that wasn't camped by a lower level char and periodically checking in on the group in the Bar. Eventually, I was bored silly, so I'd race him to the respawns. I'd have suggested dueling pets, but I already knew how Old Yeller would stack up against his pet...and didn't want to have to recast my doggie.<br />
<br />
Yep, the first few times I went there, the Gimpster was camped. I was quite happy to find him uncamped that morning I started my stay at Casa SolA. I was worried I'd come back to find it camped again the next day when I had to leave it that night. Got lucky, though. No one came to camp it the whole time I was there, I don't think. If they did, they did a normal camp check instead of asking about Gimpy specifically.<br />
<br />
I wasn't logged in with Duhikae, so no rez requests, but I did get a few buff requests. Told 'em if they could make it to where I was, I'd be happy to. Only left the area twice (aside from when I gave up for the night). Once to bring in a Guildy who just wanted to slaughter goblins and once to shrink an Ogre who couldn't fit through the doors up near the entrance.<br />

As for the ring, I didn't get a chance to even log onto EQ today.. but as it stands.. Gimpy is STILL a no-show...<br />

On the brighter side.. the Necro has promised to let me Immobilize Gimpy and she will Dot him to hell and back.. and I can sit back and watch him "Cook"... slowly.. painfully.. agonizingly.. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I strongly, <b>strongly</b>, <b><i>strongly</i></b>, <b><i><u>strongly</u></i></b> advise you to farm your pearlescent fragments in Skyfire before they turn light blue or green.  Get those nice friends up there to help you and get some xp while doing it.  Because otherwise, you're going to go completely insane in skyfire if it's all green.  I recommend the SW corner of skyfire so you can see to avoid the chromadracs (don't mess with them, it's so not worth it).  I mean, "omg I just spent 10 hours in skyfire without any @#$@ shards, but at least I dinged" is SO much more sane than "omg I just spent 10 hours in skyfire without any @#$@ shards, and my xp moved 2 @#$@#ing percent the whole time?!"<br />
<br />
I still hate how Sony rewards head-into-wall-bashingly, mind-numbing patience far more than skillful play, and numbers over finesse, but I guess we have to live with it.  (e.g. Korocust in chardok b - if they added the AE (<a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4015&source=Live" target="_blank">Korocust's Vengeance</a>) they were playing with on test, them the encounter is now 100% raid content, and they've taken away all ability of risk-taking, clever small groups with strong tactics or teamwork or both from having a shot at him, since the AE is a huge mana and hp DOT, with 42 counters of curse, resist adjust -225, and 250 range on the AE.  Considering his guards are immune to everything (snare/root/stun/mez/charm/slow/pacify), and he hits hard, has a large rampage range, and a ton of hitpoints, it was a very nice challenging single party encounter, but now a really cool dungeon crawl zone is more or less ruined.  Other examples include the mindless forced wait-time for rare but super easy mobs in epic and other quests (stormfeather in iceclad, ancient cyclops, etc)).<br />
