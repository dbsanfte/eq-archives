i would suggest first be IN the camp you want when LFA. so then when they ask you, you can say.."what camp?" then just politly tell them, i need such and such camp. if they still say well we are doing this camp...then goto the group, only take you a second..once joined, say lets roll for camp! most likly more than one in the group ALSO wants a different camp, and given the option, would like to roll as well. then roll before anyone can say anything, next thing you know, othes have rolled, at that point, it is too late for the "leader" to do anything but roll themself. and sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose... remember, wariors, SK, pal, they want tak as well...odds are on your side somone will roll that wants same camp as you ;-). good luck and good rolling!!</td>

I got mine at 54 and its paid for itself already in convenience and cost (plus its nice to be able to buff newbies for only 2 dots for 5 newbies :) ).<br />
<br />
I found that most people dont care what dungeon they LDoN in and in fact many are more than happy to try something new. We found SRO to be one of our favourite zones once we tried it (although they aggro much easier in there than in MM). BUT if you cant find any groups wanting to go there, then start your own group. Easy. Its very easy for a cleric to start a group these days :)<br />

It's because MMC is the easiest theme.  I won the first 50 of them I tried.<br />
<br />
In order of difficulty:-<br />
<br />
MMC (easiest)<br />
Ruj (easy, lots of large open spaces; concentrations of the casting goblins can be more challenging)<br />
Everfrost (mid-range; concentrations of the casting goblins can be quite tough)<br />
Takish Hiz (harder, monsters more clustered, casters more frequent)<br />
Guk (hardest, monsters sometimes very close together, highest frequency of casters)<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this will be constant across all of the servers.<br />
<br />
Pickup groups tend to like MMC, Tak (for the plate armour and the pet aug), and EF (for the chain armour, the anger proc aug, and the FT augs).  I'm pretty sure that someone relying on pickup groups won't get very many adventures in Guk at all.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">/em has more adventures in Guk than anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore can be easy, but I personally feel that they're really all about the same. Guk is slightly more strenuous to pull because of the room design and stuff, but the rest are pretty well in line with MMC as far as pulling goes.<br />
<br />
The reason people do Mistmoore, aside from the purported claims of it being easy, is that it is the place casters want to go for their top LDoN armor, and because there is a high concentration of undead. It used to be even higher, and I got a group there once with the top two paladins on the server who basically just ran around and killed everything and cleared the whole dungeon with plenty of time left to wait for the timer to reset before we could try again.<br />
<br />
Tak, imho, is popular because of the plate armor, and because mages can do CC there. Almost everything there is summoned. It's also very easy to pull once you understand the room designs. I only normally get unintended mobs when they're behind a door.<br />
<br />
Everfrost is about as hated on my server as Guk is. Poor rangers and rogues are always pulling teeth and donating organs to go there. I only hate it because the zone hurts my eyes. Hands up if you spent too much time in Velks when you were leveling~<br />
<br />
Ruj, while obviously people go there, because there's a high concentration of people with 30+ wins, is the one dungeon I NEVER do - and not because I choose it that way. I just never get groups that want to go there. I have 20 wins in all the other dungeons and I think 6 in EC. My experience with the zone is that the mobs are mostly pretty easy, but there's too many healers, and its really easy to get a train if you're not careful.<br />
<br />
Guk is my personal favorite just cause its my private playground. I was once ranked third on the server in Guk wins, am still first on percentage, and I've never been higher than mid-60s on overall wins. Everyone tends to go there once, have a bad experience because it caught them unprepared, and never go back. But it's also the place the type 7 20/20 augs drop, as well as the home of a bunch of useful spells.</td>

If we want an easy and quite night, we will do a High Adventure in MM. If we want a real challenge, we will do a normal run through Guk.<br />
Tak isnt too bad, we can do high there also, but as Rest has said, its easy to get adds with all the mobs that hide behind doors.<br />
Ruj...nps at all, not quite as easy as MM, but still pretty darn easy.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Jeez i would agree with Shadow on the rankings of difficulty except that i would say Efrost is easier than Rujark.  Maybe im on crack or sumthin, but i find the Rujark mobs to either have more HP or better Regen than the mobs in Efrost or Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
People dont like Tak because, well Door agro really.  On occasions you will open a door and have 3 mobs instantly rushing at you.  Its one of those dungeons where you gotta have a Chanter.<br />
Efrost imo is really the second easiest dungeon.  You can fly straight through there no problem with most groups.<br />
Rujark like i said i found pretty easy but I also found that mobs seemed to drop alot slower than in other themes and trains are super easy since all the mobs are runners, so someone has gotta be on snare/root at all times.<br />
I havent had much experiance in Guk, but on the few i have done i can say a few things: Lots of Casters, Room make up is alot differant than other dungeons, but best of all you can do one thing there than you cant do anywhere else: FISH.  I know most of you dont find that a big deal but hey when i dont feel like meleeing i just cast my Brell's Fishing Pole out there while the tanks melee, and the casters nuke and its all good :) .<br />
Mistmoore is still a cakewalk but it used to be even easier when everything, except the Gargoyles were considered an Undead mob.  Greatest group i ever has was in the old Mistmoore, 2 Pallys, 3 Cleric's, 1 Shammy.  Needless to say we were done pretty quick with all the undead Nukes flying around.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Guk is interesting and fun if you have a good chanter and a good puller; if you don't, it is pure hell. Also, I rely on pickup groups for ldon and as was stated, pickup groups do not go to Guk. Mistmoore is by far the easiest I think, but I get sick of everyone wanting to go there. I like rujark and believe it's the second easiest next mistmoore. Everfrost really depends. Sometimes it seems difficult and other times you fly through it. I get annoyed with the surroundings as I have a tough time seeing things at times. I can never get anyone to go to takish with me and when I do, it's usually a disaster because of the door mobs. THere's lots there I want, but I can't win there for the life of me.</td>

Probably should have paid more attention to the TAK armor and am now spending most of my time there, but I do try to mix things up a bit so I can get advances on my adventure stone</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Mistmoore definitely seems the easiest of the dungeons.  The Pepto-Bismol color scheme in Everfrost makes my vision blur.......lol.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm doing the N. Ro dungeons in search of the group Temp spell.  Mobs there are more widely spaced it seems.  Many large, open rooms will only have one lone mob standing around waiting on a free ride to eternity.<br />
<br />
I personally find Guk to be slightly hellish.  It all depends on who is pulling and who is doing crowd control.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've only been to MM twice.  I actually maxed dungeons in this order: Tak, Mir, Guk, Ruj.  MM will be next if just for the augs.  I did all of Guk with a "pickup" group.  I say pickup in quotes because it was me and two others and then always 3 from lfg.  You can find plenty of beastlords that want guk for armor and they can slow and do a great deal of dps.  Really with Pac you don't need an enchanter.  I just pac a few and then pull 2-3.  Then we rush the rest.  The worst areas are probably the room with water and the room with 3-4 tiny rooms all around it.  Tak is easy to do with Pac as well ~ I did most of it actually with Wake of Tranquility, which is horrible compared to Pac.<br />
<br />
I think all each dungeon needs is familiarity.  My bf gets to where he's just constantly pulling after about 10 runs in a dungeon.  He knows all of the room configurations by then.  We worry more about dps than cc at that point.</td>

 One of the best camps for Flowing Thought Items is EF. Also it offers the spell protection of Vie. ( I think I am butchering these spells names LOL ) For not too many points either!</td>
