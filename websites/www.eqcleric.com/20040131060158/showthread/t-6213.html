As you said the MT is expected to fall below 25% about 1% of the time. But over many Complete Heals (e.g. a long CH chain) you may see this happen several times. If it happened that there was a damage spike during your CH, the tank will have around 8k to last to the next CH instead of 10k, which might or might not be dangerous depending on the encounter.</td>

It's only worth spending the points on if you don't have anything else which is higher priority to buy.  I suppose I'd be surprised if I saw a cleric with 250AA or more who doesn't have AHA3, but I wouldn't sneer at a cleric who put off buying AHA3 while they maxed some other stuff.</td>

That would be me. I didn't even have Healing Adept 1 by that point.<br />
<br />
I have it now, at close to 300, and I do appreciate it and find it valuable, but I kept putting it off for something I felt was more worthwhile. It's rare you're going to land a CH that doesn't max on a chain. It happens, it's scary when it does, but I don't think your fellow clerics have much merit in attacking you for not having it unless you're working on far more trivial AA skills. Without going into too much detail, check the <a href="http://www.eqcleric.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=5851" target="_blank">AA FAQ</a>. You might reassess your other options and decide to go to HA first.</td>

healing adept = awesome remedies and lights, great when you have those casters who have a gazillion hp but still haven't gotten the defensive aa's up ;)<br />

i got healing adept fairly quickly, as i like to max my efficiency, specially if patch healing, or emergencies. crit heals do nothing (stress IMHO) other than let people know you're hitting the heal keys ;) that or get you killed if a cheal crits while mob is inc.<br />
<br />
i may sound stupid to some of you awe-inspiring clerics o) &#123;rolleyes}, but i have never regretted getting AHA2, where i curse the waste of aa on HG2 (and working on HG3 for CR)<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">The clue about Healing Adept isn't its effect on the CH. The difference with that is really minor important.<br />
The point about HA3 and AHA3 are the fast heals. SRemedy is pretty awesome with the Adept AA line and foci. And I think usually you cast those to patch fast. So the greater the heal amount with the patch heal is the more time you win to fire off a CH or SLight.<br />
So I personally think that this AA should be done by each cleric prior in same line as SCM or SCR.</td>

I used to feel that was very much true, and only initially got HG for Celestial Regen. Otherwise I would have gotten HA first, I think, based on my own opinions. That said, HG can be rather nice at times too. I reasoned that when I heal, I heal for an amount of my choosing, and HG isn't too helpful with elixirs or CH.<br />
OTOH, I had my class title without getting HG. MGB (9), BDA (6), SCRM (8), and random 3-point ability. (I thought Turn Undead would be fun.)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think something to consider is the investment to make HA3/AHA3 really worth it for you.  Most of the archetype abilities do not begin to really have any effect until the second level.  So, that's 6 points right there..  to go the full route of AHA3 is a little much when there are other excellent skills to obtain first, but I don't see a reason to put off HA3 for too long.  <br />
<br />
Basically, it all comes down to your play style.  Just like the MGB discussion, if you're not a raid cleric, don't bother with it (the MGB skill).  HA really shines if you do a lot of spam healing (supernal remedy/light).  If you're a heal over time person, or CH fiend (non-raid), then HA really isn't going to do too much for you.  If you're waiting for 20% hp on a tank with 9k HP to heal, well, that just isn't logical, and you're likely a raid cleric anyhow, so you'd want HA3/AHA3 anyhow ;)  Otherwise the normal 7500 heal is sufficient for most people.<br />
<br />
I put off HA for a long time because I didn't see the investment paying off soon enough for me.  I'd have to dump 12 points into it for it to really show anything substantial.  Well, now that I've got some other skills I wanted, I can go back to HA.  <br />
<br />
Do what I do.. If you don't want to say "ok, I'm working on [insert AA here] for the next 20 points.."  go for something you wanted more than HA.. then alternate.  Get level 1 in say, HG, then drop a level 1 into HA.. go back and finish HG2 and 3, then drop another 4 points to get HA2, then work on something else you wanted (say, CR since you have HG3), then come back and drop the final 6 for HA3.   I've got level 2 in a few of the archeypes now.. Going back to finish them off doesn't seem as tedious now since I'm saving 6 points, not pulling the full load of 12.<br />
<br />
Here's my advancement and why:<br />
<br />
6pts for General (blah)<br />
SCM3 (duh - nobrainer, it's the most important)<br />
HG1<br />
HA1<br />
MC1<br />
RC1 (needed for raiding)<br />
MGB (needed for raiding, I joined a new guild, wasn't planning on getting it for a while originally)<br />
HG2 and 3 (wanted CR badly)<br />
CR (woot, great AA skill)<br />
MC2<br />
SCR1, SCR2 (getting sick of recasting Kazad every hour, plus my MGB repop was longer than Kazad was lasting!)<br />
HA2 (back to this now that i've got some other stuff done)<br />
<br />
and that's where I'm at now.. I'll go back and finish MC3, HA3 now and to me, it's easier, then it's on to AHG/AHA or maybe DA or some other specific abilities like the Combat ones and some more HP.  I will probably do the level 1 and 2 alternations with durability and mitigation to make those easier as well, as I am now seeing the dire need for them both.  Going the full route with CR (the PoP upgrade, forgot the name), is also tempting as it affects HoTs and CR, which is an awesome AA, especially powered up to max.<br />

Good luck and sorry for the wordy spam ;)</td>

For that matter, does anything help with HoT spells (such as Spell Casting Reinforcement)?<br />

With Supernal Elixer averaging 2250 heal for 400 mana, I often use it on the MA in places like LDoN.  For solo, I definetly use Supernal Elixer.  Anyway, anything that would improve the efficiency would be good to know about.<br />

Ignore this post please.  Did a search and found some nice AA information on this board.  All questions answered....</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Used to think Healing Gift was a waste as well.  Until I got it.  Sure, it doesn't happen everytime, but it's great when you have to quick heal a tank if he takes a bad round of hits and you have to cancel the CH, and the quick heal lands for 3k+ for SR or 6k+ for SL.  Allows you to take a little sigh of relief.  Also really good for raids, if you're one of the clerics not in the Rot, and you're spam healing the MT/RT's to make sure they're covered (Sure sucks when Mith Marr decides to do his little 1500dd proc twice in a row on the MT, along with hitting him :p  ).  It's not something you can exactly count on to happen at the right time, but it does.  <br />
<br />
Besides, Celestial Regeration (HG3 is a prerequisite)+ Div Arb is great, saves a lot of mana when you have a couple/few adds and a few in your group take some hits before the enchanter/CC'er can get things under control (Div Arb....CR...0 mana....back to worrying about the MT).<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, Healing adept does not affect HoT spells, only instant heals (CH, SR, SL, words of restoration, etc.).<br />
<br />
However, Spell casting reinforments DO lengthen HoT's (to include CR, extended enhancement focus items do not extend CR however).  Nice to have longer lasting buffs, but I think longer lasting HoT spells is a much better reason to spend points in SCR.</td>

Excellent point. And titles mean didly squat. I'll be pushing close to 200 AA's before I get my Exarch title and that's because there are many more important AA's to get before getting the class ones that will earn you the title. IMO, an Exarch with 50 AA's did not plan their AA's out carefully, and only did them for the title.</td>

On a side note, it was mentioned that focus items do not affect heal over time spells... This is mostly true of course, but I understand that the Extended Blessing aug (10%) from the North Ro adventurer merchants is an exception to this. If you look up Extended Blessing vs Extended Enhancement IV on Lucy for example, you'll see that the minimum durations are listed as 24 and 48 seconds respectively. In other words this aug would work for Supernal Elixir, Quiessence (SHM have done tests on this), and I'd assume Celestial Regeneration too. Of course, 10% isn't a lot in this case. Question though: anyone know of any others that break this rule?<br />

So really Healing Adept for ME is mostly for cheal rotations.  (yes, with 6200 mana and maxed FT, chaining sup lights isnt too much fo an issue).  I think I am going to work on adept soon, but I was just curious as to opinions.  Thanks for all the input guys.</td>
