<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Unbelievable... as if there wasn't enough controversy about the new Druid/Shaman heals, now OUR complete heal gets shrunk down...<br />
<br />
/no  /confused  ;( <br />
<br />
Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes. <br />
<br />
Some mistakes aren't that unbalancing and are safe to keep in the game and work around. Others can sometimes yield gameplay that turns out to be even more fun than developers even imagined, as ingenious adventurers discover unrealized potential in their abilities. Yet others, even the best-intentioned ones, can cause an entire style of gameplay to shift dramatically in a direction that no one particularly enjoys. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, today, we need to address a number of the latter kind. For that, we sincerely apologize. It is absolutely our fault that certain abilities have been allowed to grow out of control. <br />
<br />
In our last letter, we stated that our goal for large scale battles in EverQuest was never one of endurance contests. We'd prefer to actively return to the type of battles that everyone feels are more fun - Battles that require tactics and skill, as opposed to attendance and endurance. <br />
<br />
Due to some specific abilities as they exist today in EverQuest, this unfortunately isn't possible. The mathematics simply cannot be made to work. In extreme cases such as that, the abilities themselves must be altered. <br />
<br />
It isn't possible, for example, to ever make another fast-action, do-or-die-quickly style encounter as long as Manaburn exists in its current form, unless it is targeted solely at an entire group of people who have this ability, as it will otherwise be trivial to those who do. <br />
<br />
Likewise, it isn't possible to create encounters that must be completed in a certain amount of time due to mana consumption, when Rods of Mystical Transvergence provide an essentially unlimited source of mana. Every challenging encounter must also be challenging for the massive raid of people who have infinite mana, and the encounter then becomes undoable to those who do not have the infinite supply. <br />
<br />
Hypothetically, the only alternative to changing abilities such as these would be to inflate every other class up to the same tier of relative power (be it damaging power, or mana regenerative power), then inflate the rest of the world to compensate for the sudden rash of new found power. Drastic, world-wide changes of that sort, however, are a guaranteed way to do more harm than good. <br />
<br />
The time has come to address these abilities. Fortunately, after doing so, EverQuest as a whole, and the encounters in Planes of Power, will be able to be tuned for forces who are interested in active participation in the game, as opposed to those forced to sit through yet another 45 minute encounter with a single NPC, as became the norm in Luclin. <br />
<br />
Manaburn. <br />
<br />
In addition to the problem described above, this ability was never intended to be a way for small bands of high level players to hold hostage the advancement of larger numbers of more appropriately leveled people. While this was not the universal case, it has unfortunately happened enough across most servers to where it became a large concern in recent months. The concept of someone looking to complete their epic quest via teamwork and overcoming the odds, only to have their attempts obstructed, in some cases, by small teams of players looking to profit financially from their power, quite frankly, is not a behavior that we wish the game to reinforce. <br />
<br />
In the next patch, Wizards who have purchased Manaburn will find that their ability points have been refunded. Please make sure that you have fewer than 25 pooled Ability points. <br />
<br />
At that point, they will be able to purchase a new Manaburn if they choose, which has most of the power of the old one. However, the new Manaburn leaves a temporary effect on its target when used that does not stack with other Manaburns. The delay that we will be tuning on the Test Server soon will allow a single target to be manaburned no more frequently than once every minute. <br />
<br />
Hopefully, this will bring the ability back in line with the original intent -- A powerful ability that allows a Wizard to do massive short-term damage, but not a method for a group of wizards to destroy powerful creatures with zero risk. <br />
<br />
Rods of Mystical Transvergence. <br />
<br />
The description above shows how this spell has perhaps singlehandedly altered the balance of the end-game encounter by turning it into an event where the largest challenge is setting up a timed rotation of Complete Healing. Once that is established, in many cases, the event is just as playable by leaving AutoAttack on, and wandering away to watch television. This does not make for stellar interactive content. <br />
<br />
We view Magicians as an excellent source of damage, especially with the many pet enhancements that have been made over the past year. To be honest, it is a more than a small shame that their full energies have been viewed as "needed" to be spent, full-time, purely on transferring their mana to others. Magicians are supposed to be the masters of elemental conjuration and highly respected as a damage-dealer, not the masters of mana transferrence. <br />
<br />
In the next update, Rods of Mystical Transvergence will be changed so that the spell summons an item that is still a valuable upgrade over the original Modulation Rod, yet does not provide an infinite amount of mana. The idea of sudden mana gain spells is only balanced if there is a net loss over time to counteract the rapid infusion. The initial version of the spell that we will be testing summons a Rod containing a single charge of 360 mana for 450 hit points, and can only be used by a person once each minute. <br />
<br />
In addition, the Rods themselves will be non-droppable, and spell will turn into a "target based summon," such that the Magician summons them directly onto the recipient, as opposed to having to hand them out manually or create a stockpile on the ground. <br />
<br />
Since there are definitely encounters in the game where this type of mana regeneration is mandatory for the encounter to be beaten by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters will likewise be re-tuned to shorten their duration, most frequently by lowering the hit points on the NPC in question. <br />
<br />
Again, our intent here is provide Magicians with a desirable secondary ability that would ideally be used before a battle, not an ability which essentially compels them to suddenly transform into a full-time support role, transferring their mana to others, as opposed to dealing damage. <br />
<br />
Complete Healing. <br />
<br />
The concept of any class getting their single best, most efficient primary ability at level 39, has never sat well with most people. In the days of characters having a maximum of 2000-4000 hit points, the spell was absolutely not imbalancing. However, as time went on and characters progressed, now doubling that amount of hit points, it becomes obvious that the spell must be scaled back slightly. <br />
<br />
This spell has, over time, become the defining cornerstone of the Cleric class. As such, it cannot be altered significantly. Taking that into account, and given that those with the most hit points in EverQuest have yet to hit the full 10,000 HP cap of this spell, the spell will remain nearly as useful as it is today, by being reclassified as a spell that heals for 7,500 hit points, down from its current cap of 10,000. <br />
<br />
This will allow it to continue to be used as it has been in the past, while allowing for more dynamic types of heals to be introduced in the future. Making this change will allow us to providing more entertaining high-end encounters that require more active involvement than setting up a Complete Healing "Rotation" or "Chain," then repeating the same motions until the Large Thing you are facing, eventually falls down. <br />
<br />
Monk Defense. <br />
<br />
Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks. Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment. This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose. <br />
<br />
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character. It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as "Monk Loot," as far back as before the launch of Kunark. <br />
<br />
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness. This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game. Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit. <br />
<br />
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power. The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this. Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class. Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem. <br />
<br />
Monk defense will be altered somewhat. It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes. (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.) It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to. As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage. <br />
<br />
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it. What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks. The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest. <br />
<br />
In closing, we would like to again apologize for the amount of time that we've allowed these abilites to remain in their current state. With Planes of Power on the horizon, in order to make encounters that most people would consider "fun," these abilities and class attributes need to be brought back into line as sane upgrades and logical progressions, as opposed to their current manifestations. <br />
<br />
We appreciate the many well thought-out letters that have been sent in on these topics and more. As always, we thank you for playing EverQuest and look forward to seeing you soon in the Planes of Power. <br />

<br />
So Complete Heal gets lowered from it's 10,000 HP cap to 7,500HP. Hmm, well so far I haven't ever met anyone with 10,000 HP, but it sounds like people might be able to reach that with PoP (read between the lines), and as such they don't want clerics being able to heal the full amount.<br />
<br />
So...what do we get then to compensate for that? Well, all we have to do is take a look at the new  PoP healing spells, and see if they suffice.<br />

The nerf to CH isn't much of an issue to me at the present time.  However the heals listed as being added in PoP do not seem to help me heal a tank with over 7.5k hp,  anymore than CH does.  One of the best tanks I knew had over 7k hp.  With the new aa hp bonuses that will probably be in PoP a tank may have over 7.5k.  So maybe they need to change the name of Complete Healing to something else.</td>

Honestly though... You really think there'll be much difference healing a tank with a 7.5k CH vs a 10k CH? So far I've yet to see anyone I won't be able to CH with 7.5k heal. And I doubt there'll be many who have so many HP that a 7.5k heal won't make the difference needed.<br />
<br />
If during a fight you have a tank who's HP exceed 7.5k, then the CH will still heal the majority of that tanks HP.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">These changes are horrible.  The CH change is not really going to have any impact on 99% of the players.  The change to mod rods is HUGE, and the changes to monks...<br />
<br />
Well, I just think it is ridiculous to come out and change something that is "imbalanced" three years after the fact.  They are totally changing the way that monks are accustomed to playing (unless the changes are not as severe as I suspect).<br />
<br />
They claim they want to make encounters doable by non-uber guilds, but what is really happening is that they are crippling smaller guilds.  By removing the usefulness of mod rods,  more clerics are now required for most high-end encounters.  Do you seriously believe their BS that they are going to re-tune high-end encounters to make them shorter?  No, they are not.    All that Verant wants is to make things harder for us, so that we invest more time (time = money) into their game.  <br />
<br />
This is what will happen.  Guilds who were able to take down raid-style mobs with small amounts of people who just happen to have a well-oiled system will now NEED to have more clerics.  It has been said that adding one mage with Mod Rod 2 is equivalent to adding EIGHT clerics to a raid force.  This is a very poor showing by Verant, and I forsee numerous cancellations.  If the changes go in as they say, they have basically made it impossible for smaller guilds to take on higher-end content (and I'm not even talking UBER mobs, just your "easier" high-end mobs like Telk/Goz/Doz and the like).</td>

<br />
Monk Nerf? No idea...Have tended to not have to heal them much, but I always put that into knowing how to play the class.<br />
Wizard Nerf? Great idea. About time IMO. When you have roving bands of MB wizards porting from spawn to spawn, killing things with one group mobs that entire guilds have problems with, just to make some plat, something needs to be done. They Abused the power, so the power gets taken away. /clap<br />
Mage Nerf? This will make clerics MUCH more in demand on the high end. Great for us clerics...bad for the game overall me thinks. Will have to wait and see how much they nerf high-end mob HP before I can really form an opinion. Would think it will all but kill the requirements of mages at high end raids...and me thinks Necros will become very popular.<br />
Cleric Nerf? 10500 was the message it gave before they fixed the bug. Now we will CH for 7500. At this point, big deal. Even if an MA has 8500 HP, do we really let him get to 1000 HP before healing during an engagement with an elite foe? Unlikely. <br />
<br />
Overall I think the changes are for the best, if handled properly. This will make those raids more interesting than the standard Casting CH, /pause XX, Cleric_02 begin now, chains that can be mind-numbingly boring in long fights.</td>

CH at 7.5K rather than 10K?  So?  BFD IMO.  Even if tanks have 10K HP, CH is 75% of the total, or 1-1/4 bubbles of life.  All it means is a slight timing adjustment.  Its not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
Monk nerfs?  About time IMO.  Monks should never have been tanks.  Pullers?  Yes.  Damage dealers?  Oh, heck yes!  Tanks?  Umm, no.  Now maybe I’ll be able to level my little halfling warrior a little, since he won’t be as obsolete as he once was..<br />

Manaburn?  I’ve never played a wizard, nor had much direct experience with manaburn or its effects.  If it works as described in the letter, then nerfing it seems one of those “Duh, YEAH!” things, as in “Hmmm, this is a pretty powerful ability…does it unbalance the game so bad we need to nerf it?”  “Duh, YEAH!”<br />

Mod Rods?  See Manaburn above.<br />

My recent perception has been that there was a lot of high-end content designed strictly for the most l33t and uber players.  That is, there are encounters that not only do you have to be over 55th level BUT you also need substantial amounts of the most rare and powerful gear in the game.  <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I don't quite understand the reasoning behind this change.  I know that as an individual spell this is one of the things they have always viewed as a mistake because of its undenyable power.  It alone propagated the inflation in mob hp to the point we have seen with the velious and luclin expansions.  Normal everyday mobs with 10-30k hp just to compensate for the ability of clerics to completely heal thier party members. <br />
<br />
All these things in progression have coalesced into the high end Luclin encounters that are more about endurance and huge raid parties,  rather than strategy and timing. <br />
<br />
As far as this nerf goes,  Its appearent now that with high end buffs, tanks on the PoP will hit 10k hp or exceed it. My question is.. what does this change?<br />
<br />
I know that even if my tank (Rayvven is my pet)was strutting around with 10k hp I am still goin to start her heals at around 2 bubs in a normal group.  10 seconds later.. bang 7.5k heal hitting here about when she is at 1.5 bubs of health.  <br />
<br />
What is the result?<br />
<br />
Exactly the same. <br />
<br />
What if she drops to 1 bub of health? <br />
<br />
Big Deal!<br />

I am not screaming about this change, infact I can barely see the purpose for it.  Whats it do? goin to make me time my heals a bit differently is all. <br />

However, as a Mage, the TRod nerf is horrid.  This has the entire Mage community in an uproar.  It was the one thing that they were needed for on raids as most raid leaders will ban pet use and our nukes get resisted more often than not on high end mobs.  As far as VI's claim that Mages are "highly respected damage dealers" they won't be doing damage because they will be constanly targeting the CH chain Clerics and casting TRods at them.  Besides Druids outdamage us. :(  If you thought Mages were scarce now, wait till this nerf goes live.<br />

You know...Verant from 1 year ago would probably not do that kind of change, but Verant today I think will actually.<br />

So far I've seen them give the loudest screamers exactly what they want. Heck the game is hardly what it was 1 year ago, and the fact is they need to do this to stay in the game. If they don't start working with the players more then they are out as competition is popping up around them like shrooms.<br />

They don't have a monopoly on MMORPG's, or MMO's as they are called now, anymore. I think they have had a serious change in attitude and accomodation policies over the last year. At least it seems that way to me.<br />

Indeed the 4-5 points mentioned as major changes relate to items that have in fact been unbalanced parts of the game that we, the players, have used to our advantage to achieve our biggest goals. <br />

This doesn't mean we're screwed, this means we adapt and tackle the problem/mob with a different tactic. At least that's what the guild succeeding in the kill will do. /shrug</td>

Yes, the nerf to mod rods is good.  Infinite mana?  Why not just go play Doom with all the cheat codes turned on?<br />
<br />
Some of you people have reduced EQ to the level of a spreadsheet.  For you, its not about fun and adventure, testing your skills against unknown and challenging enemies and environments.  All you want to do is develop the optimum formula that takes your input of time and effort and returns the largest <i>tangible</i> (ie Plat, XP, items, etc.) return.  If that’s your idea of fun, then you would love my job.  Get a degree in Accounting and come work with me.  Maybe once you’ve gotten your fill of Accounting, you’ll be able to enjoy the game for the <i>intangible</i> rewards it offers.</td>
