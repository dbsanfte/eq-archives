I want my epic and I'm lucky in the fact that I have really good friends(hope to be guildmates soon again) to help me out. I have been working on my epic for quite a while now. I almost got to the point of giving up on it until they changed it  to having to get the 3 shards. Ahh so much easier now I thought.. LOL yeah right..I've been tryin to get shards now for 4 or 5 months. Alas I only have one. But I will prevail. I WILL get my epic. I've been playing this game for a long time now and it's just one of those things that you need to do..like back in the day it was a status thing just to be able to say you killed Naggy/Vox..just something to add to your repitoire..anyhow just tellin ya to hang in there..it will happen one day..this is what I keep tellin myself anyhow LOL  (hugs)</font></td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I had been ready for the final fight of my epic for four months, in March of 2001.  Nag's lair was constantly camped.  The public channels in the zone were filled with foul language, people KS'd and petitioned and yelled.  My monkish significant other spent days fd in the lair in hopes of getting the camp for me.  <br />
<br />
I was on the Rathe, a horribly crowded server - the only one of the original servers that had not yet been split.  Finally the split was offered, we could choose to movelog to Zebuxoruk (and who could ever spell that one /rolleyes ).  <br />
<br />
Some friends and I moved.  The first night on the new server, I got home from work (I live 4 hours behind the East coast) to find my friends with all their alts out, staging to kill Nagafen for me.  We killed him - with no guildchat - what chaos!, and 26 hours later my Zordak spawned.<br />
<br />
I'm still in awe that, on the first night in our new home my friends chose to do that rather than any number of MUCH more fun things that we could have done.  It was a total surprise.  Makes me tear up even now remembering how great it was.<br />
<br />
Don't know about you guys - but if it wasn't for the friends I've made, and been on so many adventures with these past four years - well, four years in one game is an awful long time, isn't it?  I think that while Verant may suck in some ways - what they've made is a pretty darn incredible game.  Otherwise... surely people would not still be playing it four years after release date.  That anniversary passed last week - March 15, 1999.</td>

Here's the gist of it:<br />
<br />
As you know the spawn in skyfire was highly contested, as people waited in line and camped it for days on end. In our guild, the clerics who were working towards the epic gave out their account/password so others could keep a 24 hour long camp on rage. <br />
<br />
With that said, KSing was not only frequent, it was the norm. While I don't recall the specifics, basically a handful of high level guilds got into a nasty incident after one such KS; therefore, a gm was called in.<br />
<br />
Here's the kicker--<br />
<br />
The GM respawned Rage a handful of times (4 I believe). The news spread like wildfire and shortly thereafter, the quest was changed to what we have now.<br />

Most of the time RF Went down before the 3 hrs was up. I spent 4 weeks straight in SF when i got to around number 10. Well I was the last cleric on MT to get his epic this way. I waited my 3 hrs and then at 3:00:01 time I turned in a ran back to my guild with Human Ragefire on my tail for the kill the person that was Number 1 on the list Zoned in right after RF Dragon went down and started ranting and I sent them a tell told them i went by the rules every cleric aggreed to and they pretty much shut up at that point.<br />

Then I went to SF for Shard farming for my second cleric was there over a period of a week for the 4 shards. Now my wife has a cleric and We have to go to SF AGAIN!!!! I am so sick of this zone it is not funny. the only time I ever go here is to run to Chardok :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Galvatist, I camped my epic during that unhappy time.  I was also an officer of a guild ( <Blood Cult>) that camped several other cleric epics prior to the changes and was heavily involved with the spawn on Xev.<br />
<br />
I personally discussed the matter with GM's on more than one occasion, and took part in the (abortive) serverwide campaign to get a Ragefire list set up.  I also met and talked to Juliears, who was the cleric involved in what was perhaps the most controversial Rage kill on Xev, during her camp.<br />
<br />
The incidents you referred to did indeed result in clerics having their epics stripped from them, and other clerics having Ragefire spawned for them by GM's.<br />
<br />
However, they weren't unique to Xev.  The screams of anguish from the playerbase across all servers eventually reached the attention of the BBC news network, who published an article on it.  I feel that it was the BBC's article on the Ragefire spawn which finally made Verant (as it was then) wake up and smell the coffee.  Xev was involved, but only peripherally really.<br />
<br />
Personally, I found that my own Ragefire camp was what enabled me to give up smoking.  Yes, seriously.<br />
<br />
Every time I experienced a craving, I told myself, `I camped Ragefire.  This can't be worse.`  And that thought sustained me.<br />
<br />
I can confirm that giving up a 20-a-day cigarette habit required considerably less willpower and force of character than completing Ragefire the hard way.</td>
