<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I would like your opinion on something. I left my guild a little while back. the guild leader had left EQ, and didnt turn over leadership to anyone. As one of the 4 remaining senior officers, I was trying to keep the guild going. Several of the other officers left the guild, and still I stayed. Eventually, one power hungry officer and a few others with whom I didnt get along well with, drove me out of the guild. ..<br />
<br />
Ok.. stage set.<br />
<br />
Now, all of the members whom I had problems with have left the guild, and the guild members petitioned to get the guild leadership transfered to the only remaining officer and got it. Now they are asking me to return as Guild Leader.<br />
<br />
It is a casual guild, we raid some, but mostly just group together for fun, and a sense of friendship.<br />
<br />
I am curious what your thoughts are, and if you think it is a good idea? Also, those of you whom have been guild leaders before, what are your thoughts as GL?<br />
<br />
Thanks</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">If the guild is asking you back, I would suggest you do so.  It seems that already trust and look up to you.  Since the people you had problems with are gone, you have a chance to make the guild out to be whatever it is you think it should be.<br />
<br />
If you are just going to be a "casual" guild, then being a guild leader is a snap.  You will have a few minor things to deal with, such as "i can not get into a group", "so and so took our camp" and "when are we going to raid?"<br />
<br />
Once you start raiding you have to deal with loot, this is the headache aspect of the game.  Rolls won't cut it.  Awarding items will get you "You are playing favorites!" type of crap.  Find a system that works for you.  My guild uses a point system much like Triton and Rising Ascention do on Povar.  If we did not put this system into place I would have stepped down as an officer by now.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Wow!  Where to begin.  I've been leading the same guild for over 2 years now, and been a member since before I started playing EQ, going on 4 years now.  Anyway, I think the biggest thing to have is a pride in your guild, the people, the name and what it stands for.  <br />
<br />
The people are first and foremost, because without them there would be no guild.  You will have days where you will say, "Why did the Gods curse me?"  and other days when your heart swells with pride.  I like that latter feeling.  As leader you will begin to cringe at the expression "Can we talk?"  As I'm sure you have heard many times being an officer.  It is the people of my guild that keep me coming back.<br />
<br />
Secondly... the name, I guess we could be the same guild under any name, but over the years it has come to mean something special.  It is what we have worked to uphold it is the beliefs behind that name that will stand out.  <br />
<br />
I know when the old guild leader came to me and said you will be named guildleader Saturday.  I nearly fainted.  Closed the e-mail and opened it again.  It was still there, you will be named guildleader Saturday and I'm stepping down.  I think I went for a walk every night that week thinking about what I was about to become.  Okay okay, I care a lot!  &#123;rolleyes} <br />

Goodluck in your decision Phixin.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'm not a GL.  However, I hope I can help.<br />
<br />
First: Ask yourself 'Was I more wrapped up in 'fixing' the guild than I was actually being dedicated to it?'<br />
Determine if you think that you can put the same amount or more effort into being a good Guild Leader as you put effort into being an officer and trying to hold things together under a crisis.  These are two different things and the motivations behind them are drastically different.<br />
<br />
Second:  You left the guild.  Yes, you were driven out and I don't know what the particulars were.  However, you did leave.  Unless you were guildremeoved that means you left of your own accord.  Think of the reasons behind why you left and make sure that you have all of them negated before you decide to return.<br />
<br />
Third:  Make sure the membership is not looking for a 'knight in shining armor to solve all their problems and make them the most powerfullest guild on the server with all the bestest stuff and make everyone happy and all touchy-feely with great big bowls of ice-cream and miniature wiffle-bats!!!  Don't ask what the wiffle bats are for.. uh.. anyways, I digress.  Point is, you're not the answer to all their problems.  Make sure they aren't hinging all their hopes and dreams on you.  It is too big of a mantle for any one person to carry and you shouldn't be asked to carry it.  You couldn't possibly be expected to live up to those kind of expectations, if they exist, and the membership may start grumbling if the same old problems begin to crop up.<br />
<br />
Fourth: YOU deserve to have fun playing the game.  Being a GL is a lot of work if you are doing it right and being effective.  Absentee guild leaders are the bane of any guild.  As a GL the success or failure of the guild to provide enjoyment for it's members is your direct responsibility.  It's a heavy load and status or power will not negate it if you are truly dedicated.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion from your post:  Go with the flow and re-up with your guild.  It sounds like you really want to and I think that it's one of those things that you just 'have to do' just to see how it goes.  'Nothing ventured, nothing gained' and all that jazz.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Background:  I'm the creator and ex-GL of <Blood Cult> on Xev; I formed it around two years ago, and left it around seven months ago.  When I formed it, we were nothing... a dozen characters of level 45-55 who had never raided a plane.  When I left it, it was in VT, and it's presently in the Elemental Planes.<br />
<br />
If you're going to do a proper job of being a guild leader, you are taking on a full-time job.  If you're remotely successful, don't underestimate the amount of paperwork you're going to create just in membership records, raid attendance records, and loot award records.  Likewise running the website is a fair-sized task in itself - you should delegate the front page news and moderation of your messageboard to someone else in order to keep your task manageable, but I'd still count on around ten or fifteen hours a week outside EQ just on the paperwork.<br />
<br />
Then, within the guild, you have to sort out problems and challenges, which means getting deep into tells with your members, sometimes several of them at once.  You need to have a dedicated channel for the guild officers which is password-protected.  You also need the patience of a saint; in many ways, the guild leader's most important job is emotional hand-holding.<br />
<br />
You'll need to appoint competent raid leaders and class officers and assess them to ensure that they're doing their jobs effectively.  That means a thorough and in-depth knowledge of most of the classes is a prerequisite as well.<br />
<br />
Think hard about whether you want the GL job.  I have nothing but admiration for the more successful GL's, because they're doing a job which I found that I couldn't do, at least not over the long term.  In my view GL is the hardest job in the game.</td>

Leaving the guild was EXTREMELY difficult for me to do, but I did do it of my own accord.  That is why I am concerned that there might be some animosity there. Not from everyone, but maybe a few.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Shadowfrost has some good points that you should consider.  I remember being asked to GL a guild that had just undergone a major split.  I wouldn't take it, but did take an officer's slot.  I was there for over a year and had a lot of fun helping put the guild back together.  We did alot and managed to not only rebuild but to actually improve our position on the server.  However, the GL ended up being a blubbering idiot by the time we were done and, sadly, he had to be taken out behind the castle and put out of his misery.  Poor guy lost his marbles.  heh heh<br />
