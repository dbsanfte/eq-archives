<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Kadagi was born in Kelethin the only son of a renowned cleric and his druidess wife. They both worshiped Tunare and wanted their son to follow in their footsteps but that was not meant to be. Although he prayed to Tunare daily and wished to follow his parents’ path and be a ranger, Tunare would not answer his prayers. Downtrodden and desperate he went out by himself among the forest and saw some orcs attacking what appeared to be a wood elf maiden calling upon Tunare he charged into the fray. But as he arrived to save the maiden he found it to be a dummy made of straw and he had fallen into a trap. He fought valiantly but was beat almost unto death his leathers in shreds, while lying there he had a vision. Rallos Zek came to him and said “Tunare has forsaken you and will never answer your calls, Worship me and be one of the strong and know power.” Kadagi responded “why would you have me and what would you offer me in return for my service?” as he lay there Rallos said first you must prove yourself to me travel to thurgadin and acquire the armor from the guards by any means possible, it will prove your strength and therefore your value to me. Once you have done that my plans for you will be more clear, but to say at the least you will move towards hurting the one that has denied you.” And with that Rallos Zek left him naked and healed with two wicked blades to help him in his quest. <br />
Kadagi went home and hid the twin swords and tried to forget that night and what it might mean. His father replaced his armor with newer and better chain mail after hearing of his defeat. Then one night as he prayed to Tunare for favor and it was plain she would not even grant him the ability to track even the least of his foes that Rallos Zek came to him again. “Did I not give you a task to complete why are you still here turning to the one that has ignored you for so long when I am here and offer you power beyond imagining. You will be my hand my dark warrior to be strong and smite my enemies and those who would think to attack me. “. Kadagi thought on it and decided that his newfound faith was the correct choice as Tunare had ignored him lo these many years while Rallos Zek had come to him twice and had given him weapons with which to prove his might. So that very night kadagi went home and open the secret hiding place in his room at home and took out the two cloth covered short swords of ykesha that he had been given from his god and equipped them and left home in search of his fame and fortune. <br />
On his travels through the woods of his home and into butcherblock where he booked passage on the maiden’s voyage, the boat ride was long and tedious but luckily without event. As he arrived in Freeport found he was at a loss since cities were still relatively new to him at least in this fashion. He found it to be a cesspit of filth as peasants dumped their trash into the streets and sewage ran right out into the bay it was nothing like he had seen before and totally the reverse of his home town where all refuse was used to nourish the very trees that made the town and all the inhabitants worked for the betterment of the town. He put his thoughts behind him as he headed for the gate figuring it was best if he got out of the town and into the open wilds as quickly as possible. <br />
While on his way out of town he met a fellow adventurer named Coppers who was on his way to a battle of epic proportions. Coppers asked, “Would you like to come along young warrior, you would have a chance to prove your strength and valor in battle.” Kadagi thought it over “I’ll gladly join you good sir to be strong in battle is best.”<br />
Kadagi followed Coppers to Kithcor forest and met a group of adventurers calling themselves the Forsaken Conclave. The ranger Terrak ambushed General V’ghera and led him back into the slaughter that awaited him. He fought like a man possessed and wounded many grievously. Kadagi only got to swing his blades once before the mighty ones he saw in battle that day felled the mighty general. When all was said and done it was noted that the general had a large sword that no one else had use for and so it came to pass that kadagi acquired an elegant darkwood katana to remember the day and the passing of the general. He bid his new friends farewell and booked passage on the icebreaker boat heading to Velious. Arriving in Iceclad Ocean he wandered the frozen lands found his way to a bridge that appeared to be made of a dragons skeleton. He stopped and talked to the Giants that were guarding the bridge. The scout he talked to said they were there to keep the evil dwarves of Thurgadin from using the bridge to bring in supplies and outside help and to get to Kael Drakkel that he should head straight out from the bridge, there he would find help and be able to provide him with information to penetrate the dwarven stronghold. He found the city without mishap and made inquiries and found out the location of the dwarven city and where to find the kings guards who would have the armor he was charged with getting by his god. Kadagi acquired provisions and set out immediately for the dwarven city he crossed the eastern waste into the great divide once he found the glowing river he followed it to the great waterfall and made his way inside. Once he had made his way to icewell keep he automatically knew the guards here were more than he could manage even with a group of his peers. As he sat to think out his strategy a band of well-equipped and experienced travelers came to the keep and assaulted the dwarves. Kadagi helped as best he could and they allowed him to strip some pieces of armor from the dead coldain. As time progressed he noted he had almost completed the task given him by Rallos Zek. But at that time those he accompanied had to leave as their coin purses and backpacks bulged with coin and treasures to take with them to make their fortunes. So Kadagi sat down and started to sample the ale he had with him to keep him warm and to await the next band of adventurers that he might join to help him complete his quest.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hello my name is Caddarly Bonadance I’m a high elf cleric of Tunare or I was..<br />
I was a good cleric and enjoyed the task set to me by my goddess. To fight hate and greed and vanquish the undead until I went to the plane of Hate to help confront Innoruuk. We were there and all was going according to plan when two cleric of Innoruuk came out of nowhere and grabbed me, they brought me before Innoruuk himself. “So this is the insect Tunare sends against me!” Innoruuk bellowed “you poor misguided fool I shall teach you the error of your ways.” Me response was made knowing my goddess would protect me “Never will you Harm me Tunare will gather me unto her to fight you again another day.” Little did I know how wrong I was? With a gesture I floated thru the air and found myself strapped to a table. “ Well little fool you should feel honored I have not done this in a long time we shall see what your goddess thinks of you when I’m threw with you.” I felt my armor being torn to shreds, but held to my faith and thought “Tunare Where are you?” blades and magics tore the skin from my body and I screamed and howled “TUNARE WHERE ARE YOU!” My body burned and my mind twisted as Innoruuk remade me body and soul into one of his dark creatures and through it all I wonder “Tunare where are you?” she never answered my call or heard my plea’s and still Innoruuk worked his spells changing who I was forever more. It reached a point where all I could remember was my name. And still wanting to know where the goddess was but my perspective changed as did my tone as I now stood beside Innoruuk looking down at my indigo colored skin and smiling evilly Tunare where are you? Innoruuk said “ Now my son you understand your mission to kill that slut Tunare at your earliest chance I will put you down on a world not unlike the one you knew. But there you will be unfettered to learn and do your unholy task, no off with you.” With a gesture of his hand my body was turned into energy and I found my self in Neriak in front of a house of worship with a letter of introduction and some spells. My former knowledge striped from me and having to relearn the arts of a cleric again, I set out . Is my tale done does it have an ending not yet I think I still have to find Tunare but not as before now I have a reason. Smiling broadly and running my hand over the head of my mace I think Tunare where are you and cackle like mad. For I am Caddarly Bonadance dark Elf Cleric of Innoruuk…<br />

My Wife Also plays EQ and this was her reply to the above :<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nessann Searched high and low for her Love Caddarly Bonadance. She called out to her friends to aid her in the search.<br />
Now Nessann was a beautiful Woodelf and druidess, Loyal follower of Tunare. Nessa Searched all over the world for her beloved but to no avail.<br />
She soon learned Caddarly was last seen entering Hate. Survivors of the journey soon began to tell tales of the horrible tormented screams. She went to her Goddess and begged for news of her beloved caddarly. Tunare told nessan he was no longer one of her followers. Nessann begged Tunare to know where her Caddarly went. The goddess answered her in a horrible snearing voice full of comtempt, Your Caddarly is where no Druid can follow.<br />
Nessann took upon herself to Journey to hate the Home of Innoruuk and layed down her pleas upon Tthe god of hate to know what had happened to her love Caddarly<br />
The God Smiled with his horrible visage and Pointed to a Pile of bloodstained armor. Lying on top of the grusome pile of Armor was a mask. Nessann fell to her knees beside the pile and cried will reaching for the mask. As she lifted the mask she saw Caddarly's face.<br />
Nessann cried to the god what have you done. why was this done to my love? What was your gain? Innoruuk Laughed and said "To take his Devotion and make it mine!" <br />
Then and there Nessann decided she would ask Innoruuk to let her be with her love. Her love for caddarly was great that she would ask to be put with him wherever he might be. Innoruuks evil heart was moved, how powerful might the two be if joined again and smiled in thought. Innoruuk Said "Druids have no place as my followers, you will be changed and you shall know pain in the making of the change." He Raised his hand and twisted and remade her to his whim into a wizard and put her into the realm where her love was as a Beautiful but deadly T'ier dal Wizardess to be with her love again....</td>
