<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Preface: I'm not a fool enough to think that there is one answer to this...<br />
<br />
<br />
But I got into a discussion with our RL about whether I should have camped  or  /quit'd on the camp call last night.<br />
<br />
Given that all truth is derived by gathering a lot of opinions and anecdotal data, analyzing them, averaging them, and then picking the answer you like, I figured I'd come here to start the Opinion and Anecdote part of the process ;).<br />
<br />
<br />
As I understand it, the disadvantage to camping is that if you get any damage (e.g. AE damage) it interrupts your camp, as well as the increase in where you are on the hate list for sitting down.  Is this true with DA up? (which only lasts for part of the camp, I know.)<br />
<br />
What then are the arguments against /quit?  Some view it as an exploit/trick, ok, but beyond that.  Our RL suggested that if you get any damage (e.g. AE) while LD you will attack what attacked you, and that's why he thought I died on the camp call (although I hadn't moved from the spot where I camped, so..... ???)<br />
<br />
How about situational?  I'm imaging the chance of AE, adds, number of mobs attacking you, whether the issue is the mob gated, etc. all can factor into which is preferable.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">if you /q you can't do anything other than hope for the best.  if a mob decides to kill you while you're waiting to disconnect, there's nothing you can do about it.<br />
<br />
If you /camp and get hit, you can stand up and root, move away, heal, etc. and then try to camp again.  You could also pop DA and have another cleric BDA you after 15 seconds or so and you might be able to camp out completely with DA up the whole time.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">/quit isn't a good idea in most cases. As said you're leaving your character in a NPC-like mode until it times out. Often if you're hit in this mode you'll melee and cast on whatever mobs do hit you, and won't time out until you or the mob dies. <br />
<br />
I think at best it takes your character 30 seconds to disappear after /quit, so I can't envision a lot of cases where you'd want to use it instead of camping. Avoiding faction hits for boss mobs might be one reason, I don't think you take hits if you /quit first although I could be completely wrong on this. Maybe someone else knows. <br />
<br />
DA lasts 18 (27 with SCRM) seconds, so basically you can die in the last 12 (or 3 with SCRM) seconds while sitting to camp. BDA is a good way to get around this if it's a raid with other clerics, I think you'd have to time it exactly...then there's the issue of the other cleric surviving those same 27 seconds. That is unless BDA overwrites DA on other clerics, I haven't tried this either.<br />
<br />
I wish BDA could be used while sitting, but that'd be ridiculously overpowering. <br />
<br />
I don't think you can even take AE melee or spell damage under DA. I was thinking getting summoned might interrupt camping out though, maybe someone else knows whether or not it does as well.</td>

<br />
The only possible advantage of camping is that you get to be there for all 30 seconds and can theoretically do something to help yourself along.  I have never found that to be the case, however.  The only situation in which I have had to consider camping is during a raid, and more specifically when fighting a boss.  I don't know about anybody else, but I have NEVER been able to root a boss, channel heals through a boss's attacks (what's the point anyway?), or in fact anything else to prevent a boss from killing me once it has decided to do so.  Once it has decided to kill me, I die within a few seconds anyway, and therefore have little opportunity to do much of anything to stop it.<br />
<br />
In my view, sitting and camping just makes the situation even worse.  It is likely that you're already on the boss's hate list since you've been healing for a while, and if you sit down to camp, your position on that list goes way way up.  In other words, the boss will turn to kill you much sooner than it would have otherwise done if you had NOT sat down.  If you simply /quit, you don't have to sit down, and the hate list gets attended to by the boss as it would normally.  You are in Norrath for approximately the same amount of time with either /quit or /camp, so DA would not cover the last 12 seconds either way.  DAing up before quitting is still good, since it prevents you from casting or attacking the boss if it attacks you.  Then again, it doesn't matter anyway, since once it's on you, you're going to die unless someone can steal aggro from you (a smart and selfless ranja guildie friend, for example).</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Let me consider only the situation of being on a raid that is wiping out.<br />
<br />
1. Do you want to "camp out" at all? In other words, will you be able to reenter EQ at some later point and help your raid recover? You need to know the placing, spawn times, agro ranges, etc of the area you are in in order to really do this right. If your raid leader says "camp" though, it's probably a good bet to just do it right where you are and as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
2. Are you likely to get hit with AE spells at the place where you are trying to exit the game? If yes, /quit is not an option since being hit with a harmful AE spell causes the NPC version of you to attack the AE caster.<br />
<br />
3. How high on the agro list are you? In other words, will you draw agro within the next 30 seconds by sitting? If you are able to sit for that long, then /camp is preferable to /q because A) You remain in control the entire time B) If you do die, you know exactly where you died (with /q you are left as an NPC for a while which can move) and C) You are guaranteed to be out in 30 seconds (with /q, it could be longer). If you do not think that you'll be able to avoid agro while sitting for that long and there are no AEs in effect, then /q might be the better option.</td>

As for camping out on a raid.  What I find is the rare occasions that I am asked to camp out I can make it out about half the time and we usually will have some monks who manage to FD and will train the mobs/boss away allowing those that made it out to re enter safely and begin rezzing.  That can save a raid and guilds quite a bit of plat on summons.</td>

Funny story: Saturday I was doing Tipt trial and it went a bit longer then expected. I had promised to take my daughter to a Father-Daughter dance at her school and I was not going to be able to finish the trial. So I contacted my guild leader and asked him to log me in and finish the trial. He did so and then later that evening during our raid he continued to bot me for Plane of Fire. <br />
<br />
When I logged in later that evening, just in time for Blazzax, he relayed a story to me about when they were killing AMY, that his other comp (the one I was on) went LD. When I got hit with the AE I charged in and began to melee, swinging my hammer away until I finally left the game. He said it was the funniest thing because he hadn't realized there was an LD, and he sees a toon he is logged in with doing something he had not commanded it to do.</td>

On my other cleric, I did a /q once in ToV Halls of Testing (don't look at me, that's what a leader told me to do *shrug*), and ended up with my corpse way the heck down deep in HoT.  My toon ran at low health -- deeper in.<br />

I like to fight to the bitter end, because who knows, maybe you'll win.  ;D  Either that, or you'll have a good story to tell!  There was this time in Veeshan's Peak... we were wiping, we were silenced, the monk had become a charmed dragon pet, I was one of the last alive (I'd been unable to heal due to the AE silence, so I wasn't particularly far up the hate list).  I couldn't cast, so I charged, fists flailing, and bashed that dragon right on the nose right before it ate me.  RAR.</td>

To add to the stories, on yesterday's raid, Velk died for the first time on our server -- after 3 wipes (but it *was* our first attempt.)<br />
<br />
On the first two, RL called for cleric camp (I was the only cleric for the first two, our heal staff was me and a 59 druid) and I successfully camped out, got back in again, and a chanter was able to drag the corpses.  (first wipe we got him and all his guards.  Second wipe, too much lag for the druid and the tank dropped in a missed CH.)  Both times our necro was killed early on, so it was good I got out.<br />
<br />
Third wipe (we added a second cleric, so had 3 CH'ers) the necro FD'd and rez'd me in.<br />
<br />
Fourth time we added a final cleric (so we had a 45, 60, and 62 cleric and a 59 druid) and dropped him.  With that many healers we were better able to absorb the wacky lag we were seeing in Velks, although we still lost all the tanks by the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yesterday certainly rekindled guild interest in clicky-sticks!  (Ixi tomorrow night, then 2 shards, Chardok (scheduled for Saturday), and Ragefire...)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Here's a funny story about camping:<br />
<br />
During a pickup BoT towers raid a few days ago (the SW water AE mana/HP draining mini-boss), we were in the process of wiping and the RL called for me to camp (I was the only cleric, with 2 droods), and I decided to once again experiment with /camping.  So I backed away from the boss to the other end of the room, threw up DA, sat down, and crossed my fingers.  18 seconds later DA was down and I saw the boss turn and start to sprint towards me from the other end of the room.  By some miracle one of the other players was able to draw aggro away.  He died within a few seconds and once again the boss started running towards me.  His image filled my entire screen when I left Norrath.  It was literally a matter of milliseconds before I would have gotten whacked by the pain stick.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure, but my feeling is that if I had not put up DA when I sat down, the boss would have aggroed me immediately rather than 18 seconds later.  I have to say, I have a bad feeling about /camping.  People above have been saying that you should not /quit with bosses that AE, but the very simple solution is to turn auto-attack off.  A cleric on a raid does not have to have it on anyway.  Then, if you put up DA and /quit, you won't be as attractive to bosses once DA runs out, whereas if you're still sitting down during those last 12 seconds, mobs will LUV you.  LUV to kill you, that is.<br />
<br />
On a side note, my guild did this guy a few days later, and we took him down easily (we had 4 clerics, 2 druids, and 3 necros serving as mana batteries).  He dropped the Agnarr container and 2 ornate BP molds.  I got one of them, and am now wearing my new Breastplate of Vengeful Fury (I had a crappy Architect's before).....</td>

Eh?  If your toon catches an AE after you /q and before you time out, the AI makes you attack, just as if you were an npc.  Autoattack off doesn't matter worth diddly.</td>

For another fun story, one time a raid I was in in Kael in my 50s wanted to do arena, but it was camped so we went to the ledge for a bit while that guild killed Vindi. Lo and behold another guild comes to kill Tormax, and suddenly someone goes running by, pauses for a second to /ooc TORMAX TO ZONE!, and takes off again. Suddenly KT comes running down the hill and starts mowing through everyone. I go yipe! and sit to camp, as did a few other people.<br />
<br />
20...the melee trying to stand up to him in the front have finished going squished.<br />
<br />
15...the people in the front of the "flock" of camping people die.<br />
<br />
10...Tormax moved his way through the heart of the crowd. I note that I'm all the way at the back.<br />
<br />
5...He moves RIGHT up to me, but is still occupied with others.<br />
<br />
The last other person there dies, and he turns to me, and just before his attack delay resets, I camp out.</td>
