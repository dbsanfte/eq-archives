<br />
/em is about to get pissy!<br />
<br />
Is it just me or are the Teir 1 planes (I'm only mentioning Teir 1 planes because that's all I've seen so far) filled with people that KEI'd and HOV'd their way through Dreadlands and never really learned how to group effectively!?<br />
<br />
Plane of Justice... is so camped that even if you do find a group the exp is worthless since pulls are so scarce.<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation...  I tried to group there yesterday.  When I joined the group of 6 only two of them were alive.  I zoned in and was immediately trained out, zoned back in did 2 rezzes and was trained out <i>again</i>.  I zoned back in to rez the other folks I missed and was...guess what(?)...trained out again!  A Cleric friend of the group I was in showed up then, so I bowed out gracefully and left.<br />
<br />
Plane of Disease...  I was grouped here with a Shaman that REFUSED TO SLOW!  He said he wouldn't do it cause he'd "get aggro"...<br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmares...  I haven't really experienced this plane too much, I'm hoping it will be better than the others, but given the trackrecord I have my doubts...<br />
<br />
I got my Seb Key the other day and am seriously considering parking Merry there for a while.  I very much enjoy dungeons, and am seriously considering "dungeoning" for the rest of my career and avoiding the planes all together.  I suppose this is not viable, and I'll have to go back sometime, it's just so frustrating!<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I'm in the same boat as you right now Merrybrook. First off, in the planes a slower is pretty much mandatory! That shaman shouldn't even have been there if he refused to slow. I cast Temperance on the slowers but they normally only loose maybe 20% health before aggro is off of them. Last night in PoI (my favorite plane so far) we had I think it was a 58 shaman with quite a few AA's. You'd think he knew what he was doing, but every time he got aggro he ran around the place trying to shake the mob. We told him not to run many times and he just yelled back at us "don't tell me what to do!". He left later to join a "better group" so no loss really. An enchanter came along but her and one of the tanks got into an argument over slowing so she left. We fought for maybe a half hour without a slower and I was landing three complete heals a round (someone KEI'd me earlier). With a slower I land a cheal 50% of the time otherwise a single celestial does the job depending on who's in the group of course. Friday night I was in a wicked PoI group that went for about six hours. There was another group beside us and we were helping each other out and talking back and forth - it was awesome. That night we went through six shamans and finally finished with an enchanter. Pretty crazy stuff!! Other members we were quick to replace, but I don't know what it is with the classes able to slow.<br />
<br />
My first time in the Planes was in PoJ. We didn't have a slower then either so I was stunning enough to keep the damage down and not enough to gain aggro. I have yet to gain healing aggro in the planes, I don't know what's up with that. I guess I'm doing something right :).<br />
<br />
Anyhow most of the people I have grouped with have been great fun and seem to know what they are doing which makes it much more enjoyable. I tell you though, those first few seconds before the mobs are slowed is crazy! I haven't had many problems with trains but they can be deadly if they occur with not enough people in the area to take the mobs out.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck with whatever you do.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">LOL, you reminded me of a Ranger we had in a PoN group the other day...<br />
<br />
We kept asking him to snare the mob at 50% because he was snaring as the mob was almost to our camp spot, causing unneeded aggro on him. We must have said it about 15 times in /gsay to no avail.  Eventually, the puller (a monk) added it to his incoming message, "Here comes a %t for us to beat on.  The tank is gonna bleed for us, the shaman will slow him, and the Ranger is going to SNARE AT 50%."<br />
<br />
OK so maybe it's not that funny, but the rest of our group at the time did.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ya Merry you hit pretty close to the mark with that.  Unfortunately the Tier 1 planes are the next logical step for the people who like it easy.. problem is, it aint as easy as they're used to.  They're used to mobs that hit for 100-120 and wind up facing mobs that hit for 300+.  It's a nasty nasty rude awakening when you hit the wall of POP zones.  <br />
<br />
The majority of people that I saw back in my days of Teir 1 POP that couldn't hack it in Innovation, Disease, and Nightmare eventually found their way into the Velks of POP, the Plane of Justice.  The xp is atrocious, but the killing is easy as pie.  And you can sit right next to a zone!!  /uhoh <br />
<br />
Hate to say it but you haven't got much of a choice but to put up with it for now unless you can find yourself groups in older zones.  Velks is almost a ghost town now on my server!  If its really getting to you, definitely go with your plan to hit Seb or the like.  You'll be much less stressed :)</td>

Heh, I got around to looking last night just because I was curious...yep, Shazzog's offense, defense and piercing are maxed. Time to skill up on 1hb, I guess. Soul Stealer, here I come.<br />
<br />
I've been tanking solo for most of my shaman's 51 levels now. What's this "OH dear, if I slow something, it might get angry and hit me" whining all about? I bloody well know it's gonna hit me. Why do ya think I slowed it? To me, a group is just a chance to watch someone else's HP bar take dips while I toss off a DoT without interruption. Then it's time to wade in and start poking up close and personal. Never even occured to me to try to actually <i>avoid</i> it.<br />
<br />
Gah, I feel for you, I really do. Hmmm, haven't been to the Planes yet. Sounds like I may be needed up there. Better hurry up and get Duhikae caught up so he can tag along and rez me, I guess.</td>

Lol, Shaman that doesn't slow, I would have told him that I refuse to heal because I could "get aggro" from healing then. /rolleyes <br />
<br />
I tend to be slightly bitchy when it comes to people who dont do what they are supposed to and slack off. I have left some groups right after saying "I have had enough of this, please find a rep for me" just because people act so crazy sometimes.  I tend not to group much though anymore, just with my friends that way I know I wont have noobs or stupid problems in my group and wont get fustrated.<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation when I went there, was always trained out also but when I did find a group, exp moved extreamly slow.  I never really grouped in Justice much, I mostly stayed in Disease or Nightmare.<br />
<br />
And as far as I know, on my server, people hardly are in Sebilis.  Good zone, but always empty when I go there.  I think it's because it's so far out and people got used to getting everywhere by using the PoP books. /yes</td>

I didn't really like the tier 1 planes in general, and never went back once I had finally finished the PoJ trials, but I found that PoN was the best of the four. PoD sucked, PoJ had nothing to do in it, and PoI and PoN were both trainfests but at least you could possibly avoid them in PoN. All I know is I'm glad I was already 60 when PoP was released.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Last night I was in PoJ in the Captain's room. I was in a mediocre group to say the least but as least nobody died. I don't think the tank was taunting as all three melee's were taking large amounts of damage resulting in three targets to heal rather than one or maybe two.<br />
<br />
There was an enchanter in the group who had cast clarity 2 on me. Later it ran out so I asked for "clarity wmp". Nothing was cast so I assumed he was LOM. A few minutes passed so I reminded that clarity had dropped. More pulls, the mana is getting down and still no clarity. I state that I am LOM and need to med - of course there is another pull. So I just say OOM and then they finally realize what's going on and mildly panic. The fight was easy and heals weren't neccesary so I say "no pulls medding". We're sitting there and I really don't know if people are reading group chat or not. I say "clarity would go quite well right about now". I have no problem with medding, but if these people want less down time then perhaps the enchanter in the group could help speed things up, after all I'm casting big hp buffs on him to keep him safe. So I finally get my clarity and we start to roll again.<br />
<br />
Later, the enchanter states that he is AFK. The rogue was about to pull because he didn't like waiting and I reminded that the enc is AFK. Next thing I know the paladin gets up and pulls three wraiths. "INC 3 Wraiths" is what I hear and I say again "enc is AFK!". His health is rapidly dropping so I have no choice and begin a cheal. He brings the wraiths to the room then appears to run off. Cheal doesn't land because he's OOR and on his way to the zone line - real nice. So I'll be putting this guy on ignore to avoid future problems. Anyways there's myself, druid, AFK enchanter, rogue and monk left to handle the three mobs. It was tight but a few celestial heals and some cheals and we come out victorious. I was pretty proud that we pulled together when the going got rough.<br />

Some days you have those groups that stand like pillars of iron and go through anything then you have those groups where everyone seems to be off in their own little world/rolleyes.</td>

<b>Is it just me or are the Teir 1 planes (I'm only mentioning Teir 1 planes because that's all I've seen so far) filled with people that KEI'd and HOV'd their way through Dreadlands and never really learned how to group effectively!?</b></td></tr></table> <br />
<br />
Here's the problem: when they were in DL these buffs were 15-25 levels above what they should have had for their level, enabling them to do things well beyond what the zone was designed for.  Suddenly they arrive in PoP and the zones are designed around the players actually having those buffs and *poof* their cushion is gone.  Same buffs, less advantage.  <br />
<br />
And sadly, many of these players realize too late this hobbit proverb: short-cuts make long delays.  What felt faster to them in the moment actually cost them a lot of time and trouble to learn their role and achieve success in the game.  <br />
<br />
P.S. I have about a 50% success rate with PoP groups, half are good and half are doomed.  And yes, it seems the slowers are the ones to make or break the group.  In Teir 1 anyway with a decent tank you CAN get away without a slower and still chain pull.  I haven't seen that yet in Tier 2 where the slowers have even more of a liscence to be "little princesses."</td>

Slowing and mezzing or rooting are a must in the planes and if the Shammy or Chanty don't learn how to land the spells with out argo they aren't going to go very far. You learned how to Ch without getting killed (or you better have). Players need to learn when to slow. mezz and nuke without getting argo. More risk gives you better exps.<br />
