<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hi :D <br />
<br />
Just to introduce myself, I'm a 51 Cleric on Xegony.  I just wanted some advice please!<br />
<br />
I hadn't been using complete heal in the new LDoN dungeons because it can cause agro especially in tight places.  For players in a dungeon, I've been using celestial and superior heal for my spells.  I keep CH handy should the going get really tough.<br />
<br />
The only time I use complete heal almost constantly is when I'm outside in the planes with mid to high 50's groups, or when I've been in a raid group of 40 or more in a dungeon, where because there are so many tanks you are unlikely to agro the mob.<br />
<br />
Last night I was advised by a player that I should always use complete heal, even in a dungeon, which I found bizarre.  If I did I would be asking for agro, from previous experience.    We had the usual 'I can play the game more effectively than you' argument... hehe.     It turned out that I had to use complete heal as our tank got in big trouble and 'ta da' I got whacked and died and subsequently so did everyone else.   Mind you it also turned out that he didn't have a cleric, he had a 65 druid with complete heal, so I'm not sure of the point he was trying to make.<br />
<br />
Maybe that proves my point, I don't know.  Or is there something in what this other player said, as I'm open minded?  What are your views guys, when do you use complete heal and when is it a good idea not to?<br />
<br />
Yours <br />

I do the pacifying usually so unless the group I'm in really sucks we aren't fighting more than 2-3 mobs at once anyways.  And there's always the good old root spell.  Normally I'll ask for one cash item to pay for the peridots I use symboling the tank and slower/enchanter.  Giving your tank the full monty of hp will make it more worthwhile to use the Cheal.</td>

<br />
Thankyou for responding, its much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Well thats interesting.  Perhaps I have had a few too many experiences where the tanks didn't hold agro well, and that has put me off using CH.  I've been in a very small guild for a while so have been grouping with random people which might explain it.<br />
<br />
I will try what you have suggested and just CH the main tank and use my other spells for the rest of the group.<br />

I would still like to hear other people's views and comments ;) <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">If you are keeping everyone alive and succeeding your missions, then obviously what you are doing works for you...why change it?<br />
<br />
For me, the only LDoN members that get Remedy (or anything other than CHeal) are the enchanter and myself. I find using CHeals at around 50-60% on the front line troops to be more mana efficient. (And yes, 50-60% is a lot earlier than I really need to start, but as long as my mana stays in the 70-80% range, I prefer not to take chances with their health)<br />
<br />
I used to use HoTs and smaller heals on the shaman, but since they are so good at healing themselves, it became pointless. As long as it is a shaman I know, they will get a CHeal at 50% like everyone else. Well, unless I see they are about to get a severe beat down...<br />
<br />
Yes, I sometimes get beat on. Not every time, or even most times, but it does happen. My damage dealers know this, though, and are watching for it. Generally, it is only going to happen if I am stuck dropping a CHeal right after a mob is engaged (multiples in camp and the tank took quite a bit of damage on the first ones).<br />
<br />
My CHeals are always announced in group and in /tell to the recipient, so everyone knows who is getting it, and knows to not heal\LoH that person. They also can figure out, usually, when it means the mob is going to beeline on me. In a few cases, I've seen the offtank or some other group memeber head my way as soon as they see the call...so when the mob heads for me, they are already there to grab it off of me.<br />
<br />
I haven't died yet. Came really, really close once, but my shaman was ready with a Superior and a Stoicism.<br />
<br />
I always try to keep a large mana reserve in case things go pancake shaped, and CHeal allows me to do that. I can usually stay at around 70-80% for most of the mission. There are always a few points where it drops down to 30%, but I recover quickly (sit and watch the action for a few fights and I am good to go). As long as I keep it in the upper ranges, I get to melee and nuke.</td>

I have a regular heal hotkey, but rarely use it. Mostly, the only time I announce a heal is for a CHeal. Otherwise, I'm just spamming the channel with useless trivia. They <i>know</i> I'll patch heal as needed.<br />
<br />
The only times I use the regular heal hotkey is when there is someone else in the group assisting with heals (and then I'll probably let them handle the 2nd rank, and just focus on the MA and SA) or when we are all taking damage. Then I will announce them all so everyone knows what order I am working and knows that I am paying attention.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">CH always on the MA :)  The only time I really ever get agro is sadly enough if the tank is a warrior.  With Pallys and SK's I rarely ever get agro.  <br />
<br />
I use my remedy heal for the others in the group usually, and I have group elixir up in case we all start taking some damage, but I only use that when I have enough mana to spare really because it does take a nice bit of mana =/  But if everyone is damaged enough I figure it will take more to individually heal those that need it then to just cast the group elixir.<br />
<br />
I don't worry about agro too much.  I ALWAYS have root up, and I think every cleric should.  One thing I have learned is you should NOT depend on the rest of the group to save your life because sometimes you are the only one that can do that lol.  Stay calm, should you get agro, just cast root, back up, try again if it doesn't work.  The mob *should* be slowed, so you won't take that much damage.<br />

Anyway thats usually what I do :)</td>

The only times I've died, in over 20 pickup groups, has been when the entire group was wiped out due to someone pulling 5-8 mobs and having no form of Crowd Controll other then root.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well let me explain what I do and I learned this the hard way....<br />
<br />
CH is more mana efficent bar none. I always use CH as my first heal on tanks and remedy line on the casters.<br />
<br />
But heres the secret to to minimizing agro on CH. Never let your tank or puller start a new mob with low HP. I always cast CH on my tank before the next mob or I will throw a HoT on them, the same applies to your puller. Here's why, if you start a fight with your MT low health, this means your going to be forced to heal early in the fight before your tank has gotten good agro. So if your tank is as close to full health as possible at the begining of the fight, then you are allowed the time needed for the hate list to be sufficiently on the tank when your CH lands. Even then your going to get agro, "SOMETIMES", but if your using all of your spells you still shouldnt die. Divine Aura and Divine barrier is your friend, you should always have at least one of those memmed and in some cases both. When you see that your tank is not gonna be able to get agro back before you die, cast DA or DB. The main thing is to NEVER panic. I see so many clerics who panic as soon as they start getting hit and I am amazed when they die. DB people, its a clerics last stance and best friend! Also, when you use DB be sure and let the group know so that if there are any secondary healers in group, they know to cover heals till DB is gone.<br />
<br />
Back to the mana preservation. Because CH is a complete heal timing is key. in LDON with a single mob in camp, I never start CH until the tank is around 35% to 40% health. What this does is allows for me to get the most out of my heal and preserve mana. The reason this preserves man is directly because I am sitting and medding the whole time before I am forced to cast. I usually always stay above 90% mana if all I am doing is healing. <br />
<br />
So learn to use your CH, if you dont learn now your going to be forced to later!<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope my explanation was understandable. If not maybe some of the other veteran clerics can expand or correct me if I am wrong.</td>

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Q:  When to use Complete Heal?<br />
<br />
A:  Every time you can.<br />
<br />
Let me elaborate a bit on that.<br />
<br />
There are five things that would make you choose one heal in preference to another:<br />
<br />
(1)  Efficiency, i.e.  how many hp you heal per point of mana you spend.<br />
(2)  Speed, i.e. how many hp per second you are healing.<br />
(3)  Saving lives, i.e. will the heal land before your target dies?<br />
(4)  Range, i.e. is your target so far away from you that you have to pick a long range heal?<br />
(5)  Aggro, i.e. will you be killed if you cast this?<br />
<br />
You're avoiding using CH because of (5) - but CH is the best spell for considerations (1) and (2).<br />
<br />
At level 51, you can keep your ~4khp tanks standing with Celestial Healing.  It'll be fairly tough on your mana supply, and you'll probably need KEI to do it in LDoN, but it can be done.  Celestial Healing is the only other real option compared to Complete Healing, costing as it does 225 mana to heal 748hp.<br />
<br />
Let me give you the numbers behind what you're doing, though.  I'm going to assume you have the following skills:  Specialise:  Abjuration (50) and Specialise:  Alteration (200).<br />
<br />
On the above assumption, Celestial Healing really costs you ~219 mana to heal 748hp, giving it a real efficiency of 3.42 hp healed per point of mana you spend.  The alternative, which is Complete Healing, would really cost you 356 mana to heal an average of perhaps 2,500hp, giving it a real efficiency of 7.02hp per point of mana you spend.<br />
<br />
In other words, mathematically, you're using twice as much mana healing as you need to.<br />
<br />
You see, Complete Healing as a spell heals more hp per point of mana, and more hp per second (i.e. factors 1 and 2 above) than any other spell in the game.*<br />
<br />
Now, as you gain more levels and you group with tanks with more and more hp, Complete Healing becomes the only viable option.  At level 51 now, you're reaching the point where none of the other heals are good enough to keep your tanks standing without causing unacceptable amounts of downtime.<br />
<br />
Playing a successful cleric in the level 50+ game absolutely requires a mastery of CH.  Between levels 50 and 60 it should be the spell which you cast most frequently in your gaming life, no questions asked.<br />
<br />
Casting CH will sometimes cause you to take aggro, and my advice will sometimes get you killed.  You need to have Divine Aura memmed at all times so you can shed aggro when you need to, and you need to have a Root spell memmed at all times so you can park the monster and run out of range.<br />
<br />
Even with the best tanks in the game, some heal aggro from time to time is unavoidable.  The best advice I can give you is, wear equipment with a lot of HP! :)<br />
<br />
*Nitpickers will note that there are two exceptions to this rule of thumb:  Word of Redemption - the level 60 group CH spell - can heal more hp per point of mana than CH if you're in a group with a lot of people with a lot of hp, all of whom are taking damage; and Supernal Light, in the hands of a level 63+ cleric with the right AA and focus effects, can sometimes heal more hp per second than CH.  Both of these cases are far more applicable to raids than to exp groups.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My biggest problem lately in LDoN is when the puller arrives back in camp with 3-4 mobs by mistake, and at 40-50% health and falling from damage during the run back.  Then I have use Ethereal Light (1,680 hp healed in 5s), and I know that 2-3 mobs will be headed my way.  With one I can usually root park and work it out (a tree last night would not be rooted, maybe an EQ joke there?)  But with 3 MOBs hitting on me it does not go well (1k AC, ~2800 buffed hp).  Sometimes with me self-healing the off-tank has time to pull them off, sometimes not.<br />
    <br />
I have always tried to avoid the DA/DB line, choosing to have that 8th jewel available for other things, and finding I seldom used it or seldom could channel through the incoming dps when I needed it.  Now I find I can channel through ok for healing, especially if I put my back to a wall.  So I guess I'll have to start keeping DA or DB up all the time, and just cast as soon as I finish CH/CL during mass melees and see if I can shed enough agro to live through to the next heal.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, thankyou for taking the time back to advise me...  very very useful ideas in there and alot that makes sense (very well expalined Shadowfrost and Agmy, your explanations were crystal clear).    <br />
<br />
One thing I have learnt along the way is no fear, it causes more problems to run.  I just stand about and get hit on , I've also found root invaluable.     I've never bothered to use DA, I always just tried to root the critters.  I wish they would give us a few more spell slots, I never seem to have quite enough hehe.  One thing I do like is to keep my stun up to interrupt a mob's casting when mana is high enough.  To me that seems to be my most useful offensive spell as retribution seems to get lost on a mobs hp's lately :p<br />
<br />
So with all the comments so far, it seems that CH in a dungeon on the tank(s) does make sense after all.  I will continue to use my HoT spells for the more vulnerable members of the group with less HPs.    I'm looking forward to trying out these new dungeon tactics.. and hopefully (by the sounds of it) I will save mana too in the process :)<br />
<br />
One thing you mentioned Shadowfrost was to buy gear with lots of HP's on it.    I take it that wisdom must still play a very important part in your gear?<br />

<br />
Well.  Must it?<br />
<br />
Personally, right now, I don't even look at how much WIS is on a piece of equipment.  I add up the hp, mana, and focus effects/FT.  More hp, more mana, or a better focus effect means I want it, otherwise I don't.  If I could, I would happily lose 50 WIS for an extra 100hp.<br />
<br />
Let me take a moment to explain why.<br />
<br />
What WIS does for you is to increase your total mana pool.  That's all it does; it doesn't increase the rate at which you regain mana, so unless you're casting from FM to empty, WIS means precisely nothing.<br />
<br />
You're level 51.  That means that 1 point of WIS is worth about 10 points of mana to you.  (That's true until you reach WIS 200.  Above 200 WIS, 1 point of WIS is worth about 5 points of mana.)<br />
<br />
So, if you had WIS 210 and you gained a piece of equipment with +10 WIS on it, you'd really be gaining about 50 mana.  Put another way, you'd be gaining about a quarter of the amount of mana you need to cast a Celestial Healing spell.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's easy for me to diss the value of WIS when I'm at the stage of the game where I'm not exactly hurting for it, but when I was level 51 I had about 150 WIS.  I got killed a lot less than most clerics though, at least partly because I also had a lot more HP than other clerics did, which meant that when I was being hit, the tank had another chance to taunt and the enchanter had another chance to mezz.<br />
<br />
WIS is almost meaningless compared to hp.  You're a plate class - think like a tank!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Oh yeah, and to those of you who don't have DA memorized:  That spell is a cornerstone of the cleric class.  Please, please, please mem it at all times and use it when you take aggro - it will save you a lot of deaths, because cleric is one of those classes where you spend a lot of your time being thumped by two or three monsters.<br />
<br />
There are three spells with a permanent place on my spell list, and they are CH, DA, and a root (generally Petrifying Earth, although there are situations where I prefer Greater Immobilization.)  CH is in spell slot 1, root in spell slot 7, and DA in spell slot 8 - ALWAYS.  Raiding, grouping, buffing, travelling, tradeskilling, no matter what, DA is memmed.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Guess I would echo the thoughts of the others that have posted.<br />
<br />
While mana efficiency is certainly a concern, and optimally you would like to start Cheal on an appropriately geared tank around 40% with a slowed mob, I often find myself in the position of the current target mob getting down to around 10-20% hp (you do use your assist key to watch mob hp right?) and the MA is hovering around 50-55%.   Typically this is higher than I would normally start a Cheal, but as was stated above having your tank/puller head out to get the next one at 50% is asking for trouble, especially if slow gets resisted and mob takes a few extra chunks out of your party.<br />
<br />
Typically I will drop the Cheal a bit early on my MA in that situation trying to time it so he is not standing around for 10 seconds after the fight waiting for the thing to cast.  I.e. I start casting when mob is around 15% or so and find that it hits right about when mob dies.  This is pretty standard for me on regular tank classes (War, Pal, SK).  Depending on how well equipped the other DPS types (Bst, Rng, Rog, Bard) are you can usually get away with the HoT on them.  Of course spam Remedy when your Enchanter gets beat on.  Other casters are typically fast cast, Divine Light or Remedy (Superior Heal at lower 50s level) because by the time Cheal finishes casting they would be dead.<br />
<br />
Finally, definitely keep DA memmed and don't panic if you get beat on. Have a hot key programmed to let your group know you have a mob on you and then choose one of two courses of action, pull it away a bit and root it, or head over next to your MA so he can have a chance to pull agro.  Don't forget that if you do end up having to DA, let your group know and remember if they pull the mob off and you need to throw a heal you may need to click off the DA effect.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I don't know I completely agree with Shadowfrost, although most of what she says is textbook.<br />
<br />
Wisdom and mana pool are important. I never worried about HP until much later. I didn't die much. Granted I had played a druid before cleric and understood the rules of aggro, but I always found the biggest setback to your game is running oom even at your maximum efficiency. If you find yourself dying a lot - i.e. more than three times in a group, work your HP and AC. Otherwise, stick to your mana pool. Without mana, you're a really crappy melee class.<br />
<br />
Heals over time are imho a better option than CH frequently. As you press closer to the level you would get Celestial Elixir, you'll start using CH more out of necessity, but CE and later SE are excellent heals especially in terms of the strategy involved in using them. In a reasonably controlled environment - one mob, hitting the tank, and not slaughtering him, timing a CH is probably better so long as you heal at least 2k or so. For everything else, there's Maste...er, heals over time. (Assuming you don't need a spot heal. That's what Remedy is for.)<br />
<br />
To Dwerkin, I will echo though that Divine Aura is important. You have better options when it comes to heals and efficiency, but in a crisis, Divine Aura is what makes you a better healer than a druid. When druids get two mobs beating on them, they die. It's worth at least one spell slot. You can decide if you want to use two. I typically keep up 4 heals, 2 divines, and yaulp at almost all times. I only have one slot for flexibility, and I'll drop the fourth heal or the second divine if I *really* need more than one extra spell. (On raids, I usually have to because I keep Divine Intervention here. Stupid recycle times.)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Jabbur's post mirrors my own opinion here to some extent.  However, I would like to stress that you can't always set up a textbook situation on 'when' or 'where' to use certain spells.  Especially with one of the most generic and utilitarian classes of spells: the heal.  Most certainly there are certain encounters in the game that require the use of specific spells, strategies or avoidance of certain spells.  All in all though, the determination of 'what' to use, 'when' to use it is a matter of experience, expertise and play style.<br />
<br />
Succinctly, an experienced cleric who is a good player will, more often than not, choose correctly the spells that they will use to enable the party to survive.  In almost every situation, the 'healing' strategy will change over time.  Any experienced cleric has changed their heal strategy several times over the course of an exp/camp/loot group session.  Buffs drop, party members cycle in and out and sometimes you just try something different.  Either you screw it up and the session is over, or you hit upon a 'winning' strategy and help to enable the party to survive and have a good time.<br />
<br />
My advice is to learn to recognize the capabilities of the members in your party.  Got a warrior who's MA'ing and doesn't have appropriate gear? Then you better land a hot before combat and be ready to start a CH around 50% (or sooner).  Tank is a veritable walking warehouse of Monty-Hall gear:  Relax and pop a HoT now and then.  Tank can't keep aggro but the shammy doesn't care if he gets beat on:  Pop a HoT (be sure not to overwrite his/her own HoT's) on the shammy before combat.   In other words:  Your choice of strategy will be chosen for you dependent upon the capabilities of the group and the mobs your are facing.  Experience will guide you eventually into developing winning heal strategies for various situations that go along with your playstyle.<br />
<br />
Be advised; everyone plays differently.  However, our 'good cleric' profile has but one criteria: Enable the party to survive and do something they would have otherwise been unable to achieve without a good cleric.<br />
<br />
Insurance<br />
<br />
p.s. In order to more directly answer the question "When to use a CH?" I will respond thus:  In a regular exp session or camp, try to time your CH so that it lands when the target is below 40% hp.  You will avoid a lot of additional aggro this way.  Always keep DA or DB up (or both) and never attack a mob that is putting the party at risk by deciding to beat on you from heal aggro.  Wait and let the MA get it off ya or root/DA/atone and step back from melee range when you're getting whacked.  Aggro will not only kill you but, once you are gone, can condemn a party to certain doom and a long CR.</td>

I have gotten it down pretty close now and can time CH to actually hit within 1-3 seconds of when the mob dies, thus avoiding any aggro.

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Your job as a cleric isn't only to keep everyone alive.  Sure, that's your primary job, but the other is to help the party succeed at the mission.  This means keeping pulls safe with things like pacify, dropping Heal over time on puller before they're even in camp (make sure not to do it on a person who is going to FD and pass you agro), and doing damage.  Yes, a cleric with max dex, haste and yaulp going with the cleric hammer can do a significant amount of damage.  You can't sit on a horse in LDON anyways, so you might as well stand up and melee.  I would only sit down to med if you are in dire need of mana and between fights.  If I'm feeling lazy, I'll just nuke instead of melee.<br />
<br />
The key to being able to do more than just heal is EFFICIENCY.  The key to efficiency is in most cases, using CH.  As long as the tank is wacking on the mob and has done a good amount of damage, I rarely if ever draw agro with a CH, especially since I rarely sit down.  In the 60's, CH is pretty much the most efficient spell there is.  Your tanks should have 7k+ HPs and even if heal them at 40% or so, that's still a 4k heal for 400 mana.  I use heal over time at the start of a fight to buy time and avoid agro, or top off people, especially non-tanks.  Fast heals are saved for emergencies.  It's CH all the other times.  I also keep DA/DB up for the occassional times I do pull agro.<br />
<br />
Depending on the make-up of the rest of the party and if I'm nuking or meleeing, I generally do something like this:<br />
CH<br />
HoT<br />
FastHeal<br />
root/yaulp6/stun<br />
nuke/stun<br />
DA<br />
DB<br />
swap slot for buffs, MoK, MoR, group heal, etc.</td>
