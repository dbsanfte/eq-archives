It's hilarious...very truthful, very dramatic, but hilarious.<br />
<br />
What this guy is trying to say that pertain to us is that we need to take extra, special care of our enchanters when we're grouped and on raids. Always cast symbol on the chanter, always keep that chanter targeted and have fast heals ready for when he or she gets agro.<br />
<br />
If you can, keep some stuns/roots up to help out with all the great adds that puller just brought. Don't assume the chanter can handle and maintain 4-5 adds without problems... Can you heal 4-5 people losing health rapidly during a fight without getting a tad stressed about it?<br />
<br />
Enchanters are our friends... we love enchanters...show it.</td>

I have been lucky to have grouped with alot of good players who each know thier roles in several situations; but i have had a pick-up group i left rather quicky that "couldnt organize a Rum ration in a one-man canoe" as well.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've foudn the tansk that scream "Heal me" are the ones who have a cleric alt somewhere heh. They don;t realize sometimes that we all play differently then others. Some of us prefer to straight heal, some prefer to mix it up in the action a bit with stuns and nukes while getting some heals in, some prefer to get in and Melee. The joke in my guild on Xegony is that I am a Paleric (<---made up word :P). It's basically a battle cleric who is better then a pally :) I've had melees leave groups cause i've nuked something before, or cause ive dove in and started taking shots at things. I think as long as you know your job and you can effectivly do it your way without people dying then people really shouldnt complain.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I can definitely relate.  But I think using this post as a message on "cleric laziness" (Jarvis) is BS.  Clerics lazy?  My ass we're lazy.  We're one of perhaps two or three classes who can't go afk without the group grinding to a halt.  We can never leave a group without finding a replacement first, for the same reason.  How may times have you had a group member do a ten minute afk to go to the store?  Now, how many times have YOU done it?  And to quote one of my fellow guildies, keeping roots and stuns up?  "how many spell slots does this guy think I have?"  I don't know about you all, but I have, minnimum, three heals loaded at any given time, two spots for DA/DB, and root (yes I usually have that up), another spot for whatever buff is being refreshed at that time.... I DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR THREE FREAKING STUNS!!!!<br />
<br />
Of course chanters are my friend, they give me KEI, they mez shit when it's attacking me. I try never to let a chanter get below 80 percent, because it's true:  no one dies quite like a chanter.  But the first time I run into someone with the attitude of this guy... I'll use celestial at 20, I'll refuse to symbol him, I'll do everything I can to annoy him short of letting him die.  Why?  Because as much as I love playing a cleric, we put up with too much shit already to deal with a pissant little chanter who thinks he's the center of the world.<br />

<br />
Once chanters get into their high 50s and 60 their hp starts to hover around 2-3k buffed and staying alive on mezzes become second nature to them, while buffing them/healing them becomes unconscious to clerics, kind of like timing CH. They still die, but only to mobs that hit too fast to be outhealed by Remedy (unslowed & hitting for 250-300s), and not too often - plus it's only a 4% exp loss at that point, so it's not a big deal.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I agree for the most part fil but only if the druid or shaman knows what they are doing and you have a good cohesive group , I've been in groups where I hardly had to worry about heals and others where I was virtualy OOM cause the people didn't know what they were doing. I rarely have had anyone in my group die since my 20's unless someone refuses to listen to me say I'm oom but those kinds of groups either shape up or I ship out , I'm not going to stay with a group that flirts with death by pulling when I'm Lom(20%) or oom. most people learn that when we say low or out of mana to slow or stop pulls while we med. we as the ultimate healers are indespencible , I've talked to one of my guildmates thats a druid since the patch and he said the range on their 75% heal isn't big so that means to me that they may be able to handle our jobs on a small or short basis but it means to me is they are for helping keep people like the chantie alive cause the druid shouldn't have to be up in the fight but sitting back lobbing spells and doing the back up healer bit . Admitedly there are some that wil rise to the occation and be able to handle it but that doesn't mean all will</td>

Melee can only do so much.  We can only heal one person at a time  not cast a 900mana Healing AE.  Still  thats funny stuff...<br />

For us CHealing is second nature (only to breathing) as is the timing intrinsic to this - and as for the rave - meh at the level hes at and the way people come up so fast through the lower levels its no wonder he feels the need to rant at sub-standard healers...I've been a cleric since 1999 and its few and far between that I meet a cleric that can equal any of us old-timers.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ah, chanters and clerics.  Probably the most important relationship in the game.  Having played both, and having read that post months ago when it was put up, I want to point out a few things.<br />
<br />
First of all, it was a RANT.  He/she got frustrated from dealing with that crap day in, day out, for many weeks I'm sure.  I know it, because I went through it too.  I've noticed that the problem with tanks calling "mez add" pretty much goes away sometime in the 40's.  By then, they learn that most folks have either learned to to their jobs or have quit.  Also - if you read the entire thread, the same person posted later that he/she doesn't explode like that in groups.  There's only so much you can say or do in a frustrating group, and if people don't get the picture after one or two polite attempts, ya just leave.  It's very simple.<br />
<br />
As an enchanter, it is very seldom that I run into a cleric that will cast more than heroic bond on me - until I'm squished and need a rez.  It only seems to be that AFTER this happens they're all, "oh, whoops. Guess I should buff you so it doesn't happen again!"  Now, I'm not saying that I require a cleric to stop what they're doing and buff me, but if (most) clerics know that we get aggro a lot, and that we have very low hps/ac, it just seems to make sense to me that I could get a little help.  At level 53, my best hp buff adds 150 hps, and my best ac buff is 25 ac.  Whooptidoo!  You guys have armour better than that.  Secondly, not all clerics do this.  I've met one or two that said to me, "You kidding? Enchanters should get buffs before everyone else."  Honestly though, it's rare.<br />
<br />
Now that you've been informed, please kindly consider your enchanters 900hps and 500ac next time you're in a group.  Rune costs peridots, so they probably have some on them if you're worried about casting symbol.  However, I think that knowing an extra hundred or so hps helped a chanter get a stun off to step away from a mob to mez it before getting squished is enough.  It sure is for me!<br />
<br />
As far as clerics being "lazy" by not having stuns up - that's a personal call on how you play your cleric.  Rest assured that a good chanter keeps stuns up and will do their best.  Yes, if there are 3 mobs beating on him/her your stun or root is much appreciated, but I don't think I mind when a cleric is more concerned with the group's health than they are crowd control.  Help is nice but it's not your job, so don't stress it!  I also happen to think that every caster that gets root should always keep it up.  "Root and step" is one of the best lessons I've ever learned.<br />
<br />
OMG is this long enough?  I'll stop now.  Thanks for reading! :D</td>
