<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have to admit that I've only done 5 adventures in total so I'm not an expert, ( I have only won two of the five to make it worse) but they don't seem as great a way of levelling or getting plat as most people seem to think they are.<br />
<br />
A lot of threads on here or other sites forums say that LDON is the way to go for levelling once you hit 20 but I disagree. Last night I was in a group in KC, it was an ok group and although all the mobs were blue we were chain pulling and the xp bar was sliding along nicely. After an hour or so I get a tell from my guild asking if I wanted to do an adventure. There was no risk in KC and although I could of stayed I fancied a change and so off I went to TAK. As it was the adventure was quite exciting and we finally won it with 2 minutes to go and only 3 of us alive in the group :) <br />
<br />
Afterwards though I realised for about 2 hours play I'd made almost one yellow in xp and about 50 plat which was no better and probably worse than if I'd stayed in the group in KC. It's nice to do an adventure for the change of scenery and pace but they certainly arn't the best way to get xp or plat in my humble opionion, groups in normal zones are still the way to go if levelling is what your mostly worried about.<br />
<br />
By the way Agmyleez I'm not moaning about being called to do the adventure :)  It was great fun and thanks for the advice I'd be happy to do another one with you:)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Depends where you are in the game.<br />
<br />
If you're level 20-40 or so, then adventures really are the way to go, but if you're 40+ then you can get faster xp elsewhere.  The exception is if you're doing a Hard adventure; Hards really are stellar xp for most people.<br />
<br />
Once you're past the mid-fifties it's worth going back to LDoN, not really for the xp but because the points you gain can be used to work towards some worthwhile gear.</td>

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I think it varies a lot depending on your level and the dungeon itself.  Tak is notorious as about the most difficult of the dungeons.<br />
<br />
The trick with LDoN is getting in a group that can finish a given dungeon in about one hour and is willing to do 2-4 dungeons in a row.  The xp at the end of that time will be better than just about anything you could get somewhere else, barring power levelin<br />
<br />
If the group is finishing in significantly less than an hour you probably should consider doing hard setting.  If you are finishing in significantly more than an hour (or not finishing on time) chances are good you have a wide spread of levels in your group with at least some (if not all) of your dps at the lower end of the group level spread.  This is a more significant problem once you get into the 50s and up but is still a noticable factor even in the lower levels.  At its most extreme, you might have a group where all of your support classes are at the upper level end with all of your dps at the lower end.  This will create a situation where the mob level is high enough relative to your dps that the group will have a difficult time completing the dungeon quickly, if at all.  The ideal group, of course, is one where every member of the group is the same level.  After that, having a tank that is one or two levels above the rest is good.<br />
<br />
The most difficult adventures I've ever been on were ones with a seven level spread and me (cleric) as the highest level.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">1) not sure about this but it seems since the latest patch we are a bit short on money in Ldon.  Went through 5 Ldons over the weekend with various toons.  Here is my portion of the split per character.<br />
<br />
Ldon 1:  44 Paladin  split was 15plat<br />
Ldon 2:  44 Paladin  split was 23plat<br />
<br />
Ldon 3:  50 Druid     split was 30plat<br />
<br />
Ldon 4:  60 Mage     split was 35plat<br />
Ldon 5:  60 Mage     split was 35plat<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:  All 5 of these were performed with awsome groups that breezed screamed through in less than an hour.  Even Ldon 2 which was set to Hard.  Given that we were not in there for the full length of time that plays a large part in not having a large split afterwards.<br />
<br />
However, my mage has never had a split below 160plat previously and is accustomed to splits in the range of 250plat.  35pp is a bit low for his level considering all other 5 members were 65.<br />
<br />
Experience wise it is still hard to beat for the time spent adventuring.  Some groups take forever to set up and others get right into, those are the breaks of pickup Ldon.  If you have a ready made group then more power to ya.  In each Ldon, with all of the various toons, they averaged about 25% exp for each Ldon.  I am a casual player and consider that to be pretty decent exp.<br />
<br />
My druid also won a pretty decent piercing drop from one of the named that will be handed to my Bard.<br />
<br />
Even though the money seems to has slowed I still think it is worth while doing.</td>

It is just easier for me to find a pick-up group for an adventure, get decent exp, then bow out without abandoning anyone.  In regular exp groups there is the hassle of getting there (if a remote location), and then finding a replacement and getting out when it is done.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I just did my first adventures yesterday - I started at level 22 (about halfway through), and was the lowest member of the group.  We did 2 adventures - 1 normal, 1 hard, in the Mistmoore dungeon, with the highest level of the group lvl 28 (full group btw).  I am now just over 4 blues from level 24 (yay GH!), and can quite honestly say that this was some of the easiest exp I've ever seen.  There was a second cleric in the group (level 27 iirc), so she used her heals on the MT, and I rooted when needed (no cc on the first adventure), stunned the healers, nuked the undead, and healed anyone else who got hit.  The first adventure was normal - we finished it very quickly (collection).  The second adventure was hard, also collection - this one we stayed until it kicked us out.<br />
<br />
It was pretty easy - I think we were only in "trouble" one time, and that was when the puller brought 5 instead of 3.  No one died, and the split I got both times was over 10pp just for me (I think it was close to 25pp on hard).  Easy peasy, and decent cash to boot! I've been playing, off and on, since 1 week after original came out - halfway through my first adventure, it clicked - this is what EQ should have been like all along.  We should have NEVER had a 3 day wait to get into the Najena jboots camp, and casters (and priests) rolling on and winning the FBSS after the warrior had been there for weeks should never have happened to anyone.  People should have never had to camp bards, FP guards, and dorfs for exp - unless they wanted to =)<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Yes, I know it won't stay this easy, but I am gonna do everything I can to rack up as many points as possible while it is.</td>

On the other hand, to me the biggest thing is that I have a TON of fun in adventures, which has been true with my characters of any level.  What's the point in playing if you don't have fun? :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I almost always form my own groups in LDON.  If you do this, you can fill your group with higher level players.  Making yourself the lowest level ensures you of the best xp.  Also, when you choose your group makeup you don't get into groups with 5 casters and a monk to pull and tank.  <br />
<br />
XP is not the only factor to consider in doing LDON adventures.  There are some great items to be had with the adventure points (AP) that you earn in LDON.  There are Flowing Thought II items and all manner of armor and spells.  For the time invested, LDON is not a bad option.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Comparing exp to Karnor's and saying Karnor's is better?? KC is some of the worst exp in the game, unless you get into basement. Believe me, I know first-hand.<br />
<br />
LDoN normal sucks for exp. It sucks for my main, and it wasn't so hot for my level 30 alt. I don't know why people say go to LDoN for exp, because it just isn't there. Cash, maybe. Your own choice of loot, eventually. But not exp. At this point, if I do an adventure, it's mostly just to work on my adventurer's stone (and knowing eventually I'll get a 20/20 aug).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And for all the people who say the timing involved with LDoN is great, I have to disagree. I think it's horrible.<br />
<br />
When I have something come up irl and I need to leave, I can't go for another 45 minutes. I could leave the adventure, and take a loss and leave a group of people mad at me. I've lost a lot of sleep because adventures take longer than anticipated. Groups that say they'll finish in X time often don't; sometimes through misfortune or bad estimation, or they might suddenly decide to do hard. If I only have 75 minutes, I tell groups no. I've been burned too many times.<br />
<br />
LDoN is all about the clock and NOW NOW NOW! You can't stop, you can't wait, you certainly can't leave. If I have a phone call, I can muddle along in a normal exp group, just casually hitting heal macros, but I need to move in LDoN, and sometimes pull, which often gets the person on the phone angry at me when I'm not focusing on their conversation. If I have something that requires complete attention? Forget it, I'll wait until the adventure is over in an hour, even if it's coming down to the table for dinner.<br />
<br />
And then once a group has you, and everyone else wants to do another adventure, but you want to leave, you look like the bad guy when you say "sorry, I got to go to bed. I live on the East coast and I have an 8 o'clock job." When you don't have a reasonable excuse and just don't feel like continuing, its often easy to have your arm twisted...and you can't look for a replacement, because the replacement can't join until you finish an adventure. So often they won't come when you say "we only have 8 more drops left."<br />
<br />
You need to have a solid chunk of time to dedicate to LDoN, without any outside interruptions, in order to play. While this is true of Everquest in general, LDoN only complicates the matter. I don't play for exactly 90 minutes + the time it takes to find a group, buff it, and walk it to the dungeon, and then split afterwards. For the people that find the timing works out well for them, great, but I simply do not find the gaps in my schedule that are the right size for adventures.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">At 65 I also do LDON for a change, not so much for exp .  When LDON first came out I thought the exp was better then other zones and I went from 62 to 65 in a couple of days doing a couple of adventures a day. After the  patch when they dropped the drop rate and exp for LDON zones I find them slow for exp. I can go to HOH or BOT and get  aa`s much faster then LDON. What I think LDON offers is a choice , For a while I wasnt comfy in BOT , I think I even have a post on the board somewhere crying about how I hate that zone LOL.  LDON offered me a choice to lev past 62 with out having to go into BOT or zones just like it. The armor is also a very nice way to gear up if you are not in a raiding guild or even if you are . So I also like LDON just right now with my push to catch up my AA`s I am where the fast exp is and for me right now it is HOH.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I was in the 50s somewhere when Ldon came out and and my experience echoes that of others.  If you are the low member of the group the xp flows nicely, especially if the dung level rounds up instead of down.  For example as a 57 or 58 cleric if I got into a 60 level dungeon most other chars at 60 or higher could make nice xp for the time invested.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if I ended up being on the high side of the group level wise the regular xp is pitiful. I usually just switch over to 100% AAXP.   <br />
<br />
The really nice ones were when I would catch a pickup group around level 60 and the tank is from an EP or Time guild and says "9k hp btw so you know when to start healing."  Yar I start healing like every third mob.  :p</td>
