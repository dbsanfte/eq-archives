<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">well i finaly got a copy of Blessing of Aego last night. i paid 12k for it and feel i got a good price, i have saw it for sale many times for 25k. but i never had that much pp. i had to borrow 4k as it is.<br />
<br />
so. i went to nexus to try and earn some of that 4k i owe my friend.<br />
<br />
here is my rant: why do people think aego is only worth the regent cost? i made a /ooc hot key saying offering BoA and Aego for donations. well after about 45 min i was in the red from regent costs. it is amazing, people pay gladly 100pp for KEI but feel all they need to give me is 10pp or a dot for aego. thats not what was costing me as much, it was the low lvl peeps that need BoA cast on them, and since i did it "for donations" here i have lvl 1's running up handing me a dot "aego please". so i changed my /ooc to casting aego and blessing for 50pp each, and now it seems everyone wants to know why i am charging. is amazing how many people have no idea that buffs are not free for a cleric to cast.<br />
<br />
anyway after i changed my /ooc i now had 525 pp after 20 dot's so it is better. but it sure sucks that a enchanter can cast KEI with the only cost being mana (besides the initial spell cost) and clerics are stuck with the regent cost.<br />
<br />
anyway my major rant is, Aego is worth far more than 50pp a cost, why can't people see this?<br />
<br />
<br />
oh well i am only going to whore my self out till i can pay back the loan.<br />

I now try to always say "for donations".. make sure you do that when /ooc'ing.  Sometimes I forget.  :|  <br />

often when running around on some errand and I have a bunch of mana, i'll con corpses that still have armor, etc. on them, and if I have no obvious use for my mana, will shoot the person a tell asking if they want a free rez... <br />

that way we keep our reputations up... and that person may remember that, and donate well for his next rez.<br />

Sorry Keyera, Got a bit off subject.<br />

As far a buffing goes, I dont have Aego yet. So when I buff someone, I hit them with Armor, Resolution, then tell them Symbol depends on donation size. I am very blunt about it. <br />
<br />
Horror story: <br />
<br />
I was asked to buff a low 40's group headed to SolB the other day. They all wanted Shield, Resolution and SoN. Soon as I got done casting on last one, they disbanded me and druid ported them all out.  I sent a WTF tell to the druid asking me to buff them all and got "Oh, we thought it was free buff. Sorry, catch ya next time" Reply. So there I sat, 6 peridots less and oom. Next time still hasnt happened. <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I almost never accept donations for rezzes. Only if the person irritates me or they insist on it. I reason there's no price on life, and it doesn't cost anything but my time. (I almost never go more than 2 zones to rez people though.)<br />
Buffs are another matter. Why people pay 100 pp for a C3 and 10.5 for an aego confuses me. I've only ever bought C3 once in the bazaar, for a twink of mine that sorely needed to practice different magic schools. I donated 15 pp.<br />
Thing is though, enchanters have always been thought of as a rich snooty bunch, ever since people realized they could get useful items from jewelcraft. Clerics, apparently, are thought of as either generous paupers or somebody's bot. There aren't many clerics I know with more than 10-25k in their bank account. Other people complain if they drain their account at low as 30k. And if you complain? Take up a tradeskill! Waste endless hours swapping in the bazaar! Farm on your druid/necro/enchanter/any_other_class!<br />
I buff people for equal compensation if they put the money up front now. Guildmates are np because the guild bank will pay for my dot usage. But I've been at 10k, guild reimbursement pending, for 4-5 months now. There's just no way to get ahead, and so very easy to fall behind when you try to be nice. Bet I could clear out Solusek kobolds quite nicely with my Furious Hammer of Zek though; I may turn to that.</td>

I considered a stroll thru SolA making 100pp or so an hour pretty nice income even with no exp, until I read on necro board that they are unsatisfied if not making 500pp an hour.

it still sucks to have to buff one lvl 20 toon and only get 50pp when you see them carring two centi long swords. but when i get 50pp and get to single buff a over lvl 45 toon, 30pp isn't too bad of a profit, and then of course you get those geneous people that give you 100pp. those are the ones that make up for all the low lvl BoA casts. <br />
<br />
i think i have made 2.5k now in 3 days. thats not too bad, considering at the same time i am working on trade skills in PoK i just includded in my /ooc that i will gate to nexus portal to cast, send tell when you are there. <br />
<br />
actualy, i have made more than 2.5 as i have been paying for my trade skill suplies out of the cash on me. <br />

i figure another week i will be able to pay off my loan lol, then another week i will have some money in the bank and finaly have my skills high enough to go for my 7th shawl.<br />

forgot to add that always being in PoK, i have also been doing quite a few rezes, when ever i see the /ooc offering 100pp for a rez in PoD, i am on it ;-). so that also is added to the 2.5k i have made. lol but i don't answer any that just say /ooc looking for rez in such and such place. only the ones that anounce the payment in their ooc.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">i paid 20K cash for this spell and it has not made me a dime. i have never sat in nexus and sold its casts. i baught it for my convenience and dot savings.  but i think i will sell casts for 30 plat per person pay up front.  it is sad how people think the clerics services are free.<br />

quick story (yay)<br />
<br />
i was a lv 54 cleric in Lguk quite a while ago and i zoned in and there were dead bodies everywhere and some were still twitching...but soon stoped.  as it turned out..the lord group trained out killing the SH group and varrious people at the zone too.  i did 26 rezzes and got a grand total of 14 plat from one person.i rezzed everyone in the zone cept the 3 peeps in SR and the monk doin his epic thing..or whatever they do there...and i shouted. /shout ok people WTF is going on. i just spent an hour rezzing people and got one donation of 14 plat.  next thing i know...money is just flyin at me...people i didn't even rez were giving me 100 plat. i got almost 1K and said /ooc thanks and the whole zone cheered<br />
<br />
as a cleric you can't be shy or afraid to say when you feel you are being jipped if you don't say anything no one will care.  <br />
<br />
a great way to make dots is hang around rathe mnts when it is really busy...bring LOTS of plat and be banker...buying gold silver and copper from people and buying dots in the same zone. rezz for donations and kill a few giants.  if you ask for 15% more plat then you trade for change...than it is like getting 15% more dots for free. and the zone is full of lv 30-40 (some pretty dumb or inexperience) people in a zone with HG''s....so people die alot too.  <br />

Since I hit 49, I have gotten on a Preferred Rezzer list (as one of the rezzy's put it) with some people. I didnt ask for it, but it just seems to have happened. Probably 10 times last week I have gotten tells from someone "You got a minute? I'm dead again!" and have gotten about 100pp per rez just because I was available.</td>

<br />
I remeber when people would accept 90% rezzes, Now adays (when I play my second cleric level 50 now) I get a tell asking what % my rez is When I say 90 they say thanks anyways, And look for a 96. Happened the other night said nothing about my main being level 62, 30 min later I get a Tell from the same person to go rez them. I asked Where, OOT, I say sure for nice Donation. Got 100PP From them, While there I got a tell asking if I could do a rez if they donated, and brought the body to me, I have you on track they said I said sure,  Got 100PP and a saphire from that person, I buffed the both people with Naltrons, Reso, and SoW. Then Said later and Gated the Second person then sent me another tell saying thanks for the buffs you took off before I could donate for them. <br />
<br />
The second person made me think there are still people out there that appreciate us.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I too apologize for not sticking to the BoA topic.  I'm a 90% rezzer and there are times people wont accept my rez (even within my own guild, and I'm the highest lvl cleric /eek ).  <br />
<br />
I have found, however, that the later in the evening (or later in the morning really) the more desperate everyone gets.  It's very common for me to head up to camp in the Nexus at 4 am only to get a tell "Can you do a rez please?"  I say "Its very late here, was going to camp."  Which usually gets a "I'm desperate, willing to pay well."  And yes, I have been known to answer "How well?"<br />
<br />
I've even considered going to bed early just so I could get up early to do rezzes for donations.  But then, I'm also very poor so silly things like that cross my mind from time to time!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As my main is a 51 warrior, first off I greatly appreciate the services of a cleric.  When I duo, I perfer to be paired up with a cleric.  Before I ever head out on an adventure, I take no less than 200pp with me just for cleric donations...rez, regented buff, whatever.  When I go to a raid, I take one stack of a regent and the 200pp.  I always offer the pp and/or dot, and many times I just put it up in a trade window without even a request.  Of course I don't use KEI, so I'm not to sure about donating for that, I have given 25pp one time when I wanted to tradeskill.<br />

Clerics keep up the good work, I sure wouldn't get anywhere without ye!  I can't wait till my cleric is up there in levels!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Casting Aego, for me, has always been feast or famine.  I have made over 1kpp in an hour before, and I have barely covered the cost of the dots in an hour before.  I have never, however, taken a loss because I simply do not allow myself to do so.<br />
<br />
What I do is start inviting people for BoA (especially when I can't do single-target since they're all newbies) and if I don't have at least 42pp prior to cast, I won't cast.  Just tell your group that you can't afford to cast it at a loss -- which none of us can -  There are exceptions of course - if I have a full group I'm usually willing to gamble that I'll get at least 42pp out of 5 (or 6 if TGB) people.<br />
<br />
It's always a tossup, but for me it's still an effective way to cover the cost of my own grouping dot costs.<br />
