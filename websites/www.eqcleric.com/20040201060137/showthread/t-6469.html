<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I started EQ in year 1999 or 2000.. I can't remember correctly.<br />
There was a lot of events of course.<br />
Honestly, I started first class as Warrior. I always believed in sword fighting in RPG games. Playing it with my brother was really fun. then we changed classes, because we thought it wasn't right for us.. atleast in EQ.<br />
so I changed to Paladin, which really got me. I fully enjoyed as being paladin. I think most of fun period was this time... when I knew nothing about the game.<br />
I was paladin, and my brother was Wizard. We used to web surfing about everything we can do. like quests and stuff. Making friends... venture in dungeons.. which you don't know about. Doing middle lvl quest. ofcourse there were always ppl willing to help out the quests with us in dungeon. I missed that time. Even though I had 1.5k hp at lvl 55... I was very happy to play. People don't blame me for having bad equip. They just wanted to enjoy and equip didnt matter much back then, if you ask me... Mob didn't hit for whole lot u know?<br />
then I quitted my paladin and made my mag.<br />
Doing all over again, getting epic... It wasn't much fun as it used to. I could solo anywhere. Seems like so pointless to do solo. And yet, I lost purpose of the game. Enjoying Mag for couple months, I decided to make another melee.<br />
then I made Rogue... I got tons of AAs, Ifir, and sol ro dagger.. elemental armor and stuff. Now at this time, I didn'thave purpose to play EQ. Raid didn't inspire me at all. it was like UO... when they patched PvP system... I thought I have to move on to next game...<br />
What is EQ? I asked myself... it wasn't about the game... uber items... or even Plats. it had to be fun for me. Then I realize I was playing EQ for uber items in raid... that was my only purpose... Not to have fun.. but get good items and be uber.<br />
<br />
today, I don't plan to join any raid guilds... it is so horrify to think about raid.<br />
Now I think I'm having fun in EQ... I just need to control playtime<br />
<br />
but I still miss old dayz... when I was with my paladin... Swinging 30/45 2HS and proud of it because I got it from the quest... not from high lvl passing by killed mob and dropped some random sword I ninja looted. I don't know about new players... Bazaar system is useful, but it killed EQ fun. Too many expansion got item improved.. but there was no longer need for old expansion's items.<br />
<br />
Years have passed since Kunark and velious realeased... while I run through empty zones...<br />
I remind myself... I was here... with friends... in cold nights... where I grouped to become higher lvl... Eyes on friends' faces... relying on them...<br />
<br />
Well what's EQ in u?</td>

<br />
EQ has been a lot of different things to me. It started off being an amusement - my new pre-occupation that just replaced the last game I was playing. Then it became a pastime - something that would linger when the next thing came around. When I started to be overcome by depression, it was my salvation - there was literally nothing else, even going to the bathroom at times, that would get me out of bed. Now it is my curse and addiction, and I am trying to break free of it, while at the same time it is also my hobby and something I have put so much time into that I don't know how or why I would want to just walk away.<br />
<br />
In the last 3 years, come Feb 2, I will have spent (as a crude estimate) 280 of those 1095 days doing nothing but playing Everquest. Needless to say, it means a great deal to me, and a good many things. Three years...reminds me of a quote from Our Town...something to the effect of "How can I ever leave this place? It's all I've been, it's all I've known." Quite honestly, I find it hard to identify much with my life anymore without it. Is this the sign of an addict, or someone who just truly loves it, or somewhere in-between? I don't know, but I'm not averaging 12 hours per day any more, and mostly just continuing for the people now.<br />
<br />
So I suppose that's what EQ is to me now. A place where my friends are.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I started playing EQ as a VAH Rogue back in 2000.  I busted one of my co-workers playing it in his cube one morning when I walked in.  Asked him a ton of questions about the game.  Needless to say I went out and grabed the Trilogy and SoL that afternoon.  I was so pumped to see a character that I had brought into the world.  <br />
<br />
Nakid and clueless about the game I ran around a dark and empty town.  I was so happy to see my co-workers new Beastlord in front of me after my 5th death.  He showed me around town and how to configure Macros.  I leveled that Rogue to 23 and deserted him for my wifes cleric that she had left behind on my account.   I love this class and will probably never change.<br />
<br />
I have met so many people on my server some have become like family to me.   I have left EQ for SWG and came back.   I have left EQ for Final Fantasy XI and came back.  Nothing can ever replace the work or friendships I have put into EQ.</td>

<br />
I'm an avid gamer...always have been. Never did find a game that had serious longevity beyond completion and I kept wishing they'd come out with a game that never finished...<br />
<br />
I was hesitant to the whole EverQuest concept at first. I did not like the idea of paying a monthly fee to play a game. When a friend showed me his character, bringing his CD's and showing the game off, I got hooked. It was so enticing and amazing.<br />
<br />
Being an old chatter, and an old IRC user to me EQ is like a chatroom with a game around it. The social aspect in the game alone is what keeps me going. Some days I log in and just chat, not knowing what to do..other days I'm all hardcore gaming, hardly uttering a word.<br />
<br />
Being Jarvis in-game is not always easy. It can take me hours to get anything done. I get a lot of tells and a lot of cross server tells, so I often slip into alter-egos, playing in the shadow of an unknown character.<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to EverQuest 2, anticipating the changes coming, but I can also tell you that Sigil Games, holding the core of the orginial concept of EQ is getting my attention.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is EQ is to me what a chatroom and a game combined would be. It's everything the TV can't be and it's everything I like in a game...Oh and I get to kill stuff..yeah...killing stuff is fun...</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I have been playing since 1999.  I had a friend at work tell me about it so I tried it and liked it.  I don't play to level or get the ultimate gear.  My main is a mage and has only leveled to 59 in over 4 years time.  I do play 6 different toons though.  I play to have fun.  I don't experience grind or farm for money for the most part, not that I have not tried it.  It is not my cup of tea and removes the fun for me.  I try to hit all of the zones that would be an exp zone for my characters level.  Quite often my buddy and I will be the only 2 in the zone, depending on where we go.  I also only play 3 nites a week for only 3 hours at a time.  I don't put a lot of time into the game because I am married with children, I just don't have the time most others seem to have.  I am guilded, AGAIN, but I find that I can't raid with them because of the time constraints.  They either raid on a nite that I don't play or they schedule it for a west coast time and I am an east coaster, at least my time zone is.<br />

This is a game and a great one at that.  I have played other similar games though BETA testing.  I beta a lot for variety.  Once you get enough decent games under your belt you don't even have to apply all that much.  I get e-mails to beta new games from some decent companies.  <br />
<br />
Sorry, started to ramble off subject.  I think this is the best game I have ever played.  A lot has changed over the years but it is still tops in my book.  Will any of my characters ever get to 65? Who knows.  I have a few over 50 now and I don't know how.  Level 50 is a land mark for me anyways, that was the cap when I started so it does hold something special.  But I never set out to become any level or get specific gear, I just play.</td>

It isn't a 'game' to me anymore...a game is something I play for a few weeks, then taper off or quit.<br />
It is a hobby. I have goals, both long and short term, that I am working towards, skills to hone or develop, strategies to try...<br />
<br />
I used to play pen and paper RPGs all the time, but don't have a decent regular group now (I have one group that meets once a month or so, but I have to travel 2 hours each way to play, so I only do it once a month or so...)<br />
<br />
It is also (normally) a stress reliever for me. On most nights, I can log in, forget all my work stress, and kill things, do tradeskills, etc</td>

i love that.<br />
<br />
EQ for me started as just a game, I came from an IRC and MUD background, so i was a little dubious at first...<br />
<br />
i started a wizard first, a friend (a cleric) got me moved from erudin to freeport... (by running it, could not find a porter... man was that scary!)<br />
<br />
then he took a break from EQ... :,(   i was stuck in a strange town... so i ended up taking a couple months off... then a new server started up.. Firiona Vie, so i started playing again... as a Gnome Mage... then my friend came back and I started a druid...<br />
<br />
now i two box a warrior/cleric or necro/paladin for the most part... but i come back day after day for the friends.  both those IRL and those that i have only ever typed at.<br />
<br />
like was said previously, this is more than a game, a game could never keep my attention for this long.  without the people, this "game" is nothing.</td>
