<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ok I started Eq when it went live. I had an EQ beta account but never used it because I didn't have the machine to run EQ yet. Anyways, was wanting to pass on some memories from back in the early days.<br />
<br />
Like my first experience with swimming: I fell in a pool in Qeynos and couldn't get out. Swam for 30 minutes before I finally gave up and said screw it and died. Then when I went back to get my corpse, which had UBER gear (cloth) I kept trying to use /corpse but couldnt get close enough, so I finally decided to get back in and try again. Needless to say I died again, only this time after 10 minutes of swimming and typing /corpse because I didnt know how to use hotkeys yet. I refused to cross water for a long time after that. Swimming wasn't the problem, it was getting out over the edge.<br />
<br />
Or the first time I zoned into North Karana, I saw this "Flying Lion" aka Griffon, I was so amazed at it's looks I ran to it to get a closer look and was pummeled quickly.<br />
<br />
Or the first time I discovered the guards would save my ass. I had been playing around and getting killed trying to get some XP. I had no idea I could run to the guards, then I finally said, screw it, I'm gonna try to make it to the zone so I ran like a madman, and was astonished when I saw the Guards yelling and turned to see them stomp my pursuers to death.<br />
<br />
Man the number of deaths back then before we knew anything about the game. It was hell but looking back it sure makes you appreciate what you have now!<br />
<br />
I've got TONS of stories but will save them for later, let's here some of your early days stories!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73"><font color="skyblue">My first days were spent in the Greater Faydark, as you might expect.  I probably stayed there and in Clan Crushbone far too long; the mobs were greening out...but where else could I go, right?  Sure, some folks had talked about heading to the Estate of Unrest.  The way they described it, I wasn't sure if I was ready to travel all the way there! /eek <br />
<br />
I remember with great awe my first boat ride; the fact that the world was big enough for a boat trip to take half a day (relatively) amazed me.  I had just come off of playing Diablo 2 pretty religiously, and this was totally different in breadth and scope.<br />
<br />
I remember nervously eyeing the chat window as I stuck my face in the book, medding my little elven butt off, to keep an eye out for anything bad that might be happening.<br />
<br />
It was truly a wonderful time, all of the firsts; I don't mourn the loss of some of the game mechanics.  The PoK books have been both a boon and a bane; they are a great convenience, but at the same time they do trivialize a lot of the faction issues for race.<br />

I do miss those early days, sometimes, for their wonder and fear.</font></td>

I wish they never implimented Luclin/PoK travel. /frown IMO, that was one of the very undoings for old schoolers like us. I came in way before Luclin was out (not as far back as you Kunark old timers) but it was ALOT more fun to traverse the countryside not knowing what was there than just reading from a book and having it "magically" transport you to timbucktwo. I kinda sympathize with the druids and wizards now because Luclin/PoK ruined the game (pretty much) for them. That was their lot in life. Now they are port bishs for CR's... kinda like clerics. Now we're rez bishs but we have comptetition. Hrm, I suddenly don't feel so symphathetic. :D</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">It was when I discovered the alcohol system for the first time, raving how the tiny room in Kaladim I was in suddenly looked like a long hut. Falling off the OOT boat with my level 6 rogue because I was passing the time somersaulting off the top and slipped, maxing my swimming in the process (but creating several hours of frustration). The drunken bash after the wedding where I first joined my guild, the drunken swimming and the duels. I had a 45 minute duel with a monk friend in my guild because his mend matched perfectly my mana pool, me blinding him and he using his sound to try to track me to the tree I would hide behind. That first sight of Field of Bone. Pulling up the walls in Everfrost. Exploring Permafrost solo having no idea what I was getting into. The train at the basement of Unrest that swallowed my group. Going into Unrest, all the way through Najena with my guild friends, questing Ro armor for the necro among us. The day I got my nickname. When I organized a mid-twenties group of four and leveled crazily in Frontier Mountains, at a time when the zone was jeering at us that there was no way we could survive there. We did, with amazing execution of an enchanter, myself, and a druid (the pally was an idiot who didn't even taunt. We replaced him with the chanter's animation 8D) Sneaking around Guk knowing that one wrong move was instant death (Mask of  Deception with my rogue). Organizing a rescue party for some stranger who had fallen down the well to the 3rd floor of Befallen, jumping down and surviving by our teeth before the druid came for evac. I just recently went deep solo into Sol A. :) First time ported into Lavastorm and being really intimidated. Getting so lost in Neriak that I gave up the character (mage). Surviving the most impossible train with an amazing group by KFC, everyone calling out mana, the next available heal or nuke. A low 20s cleric (moi) trying to figure out how to break the Penthouse with some well-placed lulls. My bandit group in the WC when we managed to all survive an attack by the werewolf; learning to love LoH because of it. Sneaking in the bowels of Blackburrow with my rogue knowing again that if I did something wrong I was toast; surviving with the reward of an upgraded piercer: Giant Snake Fang.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My first big expedition came after the first few days playing, right after Velious came out. I made a dwarf cleric, and wanted to play with my wife's Barbarian Shaman.. I had NO idea how to get to Halas, or even that there was such a thing as a boat! But eventually I got directions and ran my level 4 butt to the docks, to Freeport.. OMG I was so amazed at the giant spiders in WC. Somehow I haven't died yest, listening to the advice somone told me "Stay on the walls and you'll be all right." Zone into Kithkor, run around there forever, lost as heck. Finally make it into HHP. Someone at the orc camp showed me across the zone =)  The amazing run down the gorge in EK, across EK... I finally made it all the way to Blackburrow wih no sow, no port, and no idea what I was doing. Then I proceeded to get pummled by gnolls and panic and jump into the water pit, thinking that'll save me! My second time around I met a God who could port me all the way to NK, then bound me in Qeynos.. that guy was the most uber person I have ever seen in EQ. Level 29! But I was on my own once again to make it through  Blackburrow, I succeed this time (corpse was left to rot for the ages.) I found my way through, by sheer dumb luck, and saw my wonderful wife waiting on the other side of the zone! (I was so confused that she couldn't see me "What, it's not too dark?")</td>

I start my way over not knowing what things are like running from freeport through kithkor(I got so lucky it was daytime and I had gotten sow from an ubber Shaman) I got through highpass and it was night and well needdless to say I found out that there was a gorge there but was like what the heck my safefall got better. made run all over just to find my corpse was missing (went down to bottom right way in daylight and all the way back to beginning in the bottom) ended up petitioning GM cause corpse was so far up wall it could not be gotten with corpse command from either side top or bottom. Got my body back and then completed run and got mad cause I kept getting lost in qeynos. I said the heck with it logged him there and started a new character my first cleric and have been playing clerics since. not left that server not long after cause all our friends went pvp and we had friends on another server so we went there and have had a blast</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Heh, ever notice how the most memorable experience people have from Ye Olde Days involves trying to get across Antonica?<br />
<br />
When I first played EQ, back when dinosaurs roamed the earth...errr, wait, before dinosaurs roamed the earth, I mean...<br />
Anyway, I started some caster types in Felwith and Kelethin at first, but quickly decided that the Unlife was the life for me, and started a Necro in Odus.<br />
It took forever to get to level 8...I didn't have Paineel or the Warrens to help me. Toxula Forest, empty now, was full of other people fighting for the kobold camps. Kerra was usually easier to find something to kill for XP, but that damn UberKitty that kept running through usually meant a retreat every few minutes. I mean, yeesh, it was a level 14 MOb! How were we supposed to beat it?/eek <br />
<br />
When I finally managed to get to 8, I headed for Queynos. I think I probably spent more time riding that damn boat then I did fighting anything for two days, as I tried to get through Qeynos before Gather Shadows died (causing me to die soon after).<br />
<br />
I finally made it through, though, and found someone nice enough to bind me in Qeynos Newbie zone, so at least I didn't have to worry as much about dying.<br />
Except BlackBurrow was way overcamped, and West Karana was way too empty.<br />
Now, instead of 20 minute boat rides that I could walk away from, I had 20 minute runs with my fingers crossed, hoping that - once again- Gather Shadows wouldn't drop at a Really Bad Time.<br />
<br />
I had heard that Freeport was much more welcoming, so I decided to try to make it there. Hail, another 2 days worth of CR's.<br />
Finally made it through the Pass and into Kithkor. This was before it went all Dark and Forbidding. I remember switching to Walk just so I could enjoy the scenery.<br />
<br />
Imagine my joy when I /con'd the Freeport Guards and found I wasn't KoS. Sadly, the dwarves in Butcherblock were not so welcoming when I decided to visit fair Faydwer...Luckily, I was 12 before I made that trip, and was able to bind before venturing in to new areas.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Probably one of the best times I have ever had in EQ happened early on, before Kunark. My guild had an event called the drunken troll race. What we did, was to make level 1 trolls, get them drunk and see who could make it to Freeport first and killed by a guard. I have never laughed so hard in all my laugh! We had a guildie loaded with booze sitting at each of the zones, so if you became sober you could refill.<br />
<br />
We had one of our guys actually make it all the way to the bank in North Freeport!<br />
<br />
Another time me and some friends who played Necro's also, decided we would go see what we could waste. There were 5 necro's and 1 Shadowknight. We went to Freeport and decided to kill the Priest of Discord! Holy smokes! Im not sure anyone had ever tried that before. Since it was fairly early in EQ. Talk about funny. PoD runs fast, if you dont have SOW forget trying to get away from him. What was funny was to see 6 skeleton pets running around in circles, trying to catch PoD while one of the necros was running just trying to get away. I guess you would have had to been there. anyways, we didnt kill PoD "that" day, but we sure had a lot of fun! We drew a crowd of people shouting us on. What a blast.</td>

My curiousity got the better of me and I found myself content just exploring and hunting from the cave in Everfrost out to the newb area. I didn't go very far in the newb area from all the dangers but I thought it was so cool just to be participating in the world of EQ.<br />
<br />
I wondered what that town was I was first in when I began to play and how to get there. I had no idea the cave led back to Halas as it was too dark for me to see. Later on I would find EQ Atlas and see the map showing the cave. I thought that was cool enough for me :D.</td>

<br />
Just so people can realize how limited the scope of travel can be for some, I present my memory.<br />
<br />
My first character in EQ was an ogre warrior on Povar (started day 1 or whenever the server first came up and Verant got their act together.)  I did the whole leveled up with folks starting out in The Ferrott,  My travel, as an ogre warrior, involed going from the gates of the city to the entrance of Cazic Thule in the time it took me to lvl from lvl 1 to lvl 12 (I think that was the level I was when I first stepped into Cazic Thule.)  Granted leveling from lvl 1 to lvl 12 took like forever.<br />
<br />
I remember stepping into Cazic Thule and seeing a couple people sitting at zone in in Rubicite Armour and thinking "Wow!"  Those people were the leading edge in leveling and farming players!  It was very impressive to see that type of loot like a week after the game had come out.<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is the extent of my travel in like 12 levels was from the gates of the city of Ogguk to the Temple that leads to Cazic-Thule!  LOL!  I look back on that and think I really should have gotten out more!  Now you can see lvl 1 characters all over.</td>

<br />
I remember needing desperatly that combine longsword sold by the vendors in Oasis so I could make my fortune killing Wisps.  Ya need a magic sword to hit them ya know.  Only got killed twice running down the middle of oasis like a fool at level 8.  The shriveled mummies had a field day with me.  That SK was an undead magnet.  The beauty of it all was that that particular vendor did not care for darkelves and would not sell to me.  Luckily an honest barb came along and used my hard earned coin to purchase it for me.<br />
<br />
I remember creating my Erudite mage.  Blind as a bat.  I never will understand why they made that pass sooo dark to get out to the forest to hunt.  I passed by the crystal without knowing it.  (It got darker as I approached it and could not see it with my UBER candle equipped)  Seems I took a flying leap off the railing.  I fell to my first EQ death without ever having engaged a mob.<br />
<br />
I remember fiting snakes in toxulia for days to get enough skins to sell so I could purchase a senior apprentice robe.  It was quite nice.  I even killed a kobold that had a backpack.  I needed a place to keep all those snake skins but I sold it anyways so I could purchase a lantern.  I could see now.<br />
<br />
Level 3 my friend talked me into the kobold camps.  We were running out and I got caught by a skeleton, not a decayed skeleton, A Skelton.  He killed me and my new blue robe was out in the forest somewhere.  I died 3 times by other skeletons trying to get it back.  Eventually I did get it.<br />
<br />
Turning 12 we went to the bandit camps in west karana.  Breaking the spawn meant an all out war.  Someone cast on one or pulled it somehow and it was an all out brawl, our group of 6 against their group of 6.  Someone almost always died or if not it was a great fite.  <br />
<br />
The werewolf was a trip.  When he showed up there was no running.  (of course I was an erudite...I couldn't outrun a firebeetle)  He would tear through a bandit group then leave 6 corpses behind.<br />
<br />
I zoned into nektulos forest once out of curiosity.  Should have realized when I saw all the others medding outside the zone in EC.  I zoned in only to have Corporal Whoopazz hand me a hearty welcome to the darkelf newbie area.<br />
<br />
One of my other darkelves was in a guild quite a few years ago.  It was a lot of fun until the "reverent mother" went insane and deleted the guild.  not sure why but who cares.  We did have a few crazy guild raids which were a lot of fun.  I think I died atleast once on every guild raid except for one into befallen.  Guild life was fun when it was good but now none of my toons are guilded.<br />
<br />
I have been chased out of more zones by mobs out of sheer stupidity than I can count.  Gee rocky, watch me pull a mob out of that hut.  TRAIN TO ZONE!!!<br />

Luckily I have a good friend that has a counter toon to group with almost everyone of my toons.  Then we can laugh about the stupid things we did the night before.<br />

<br />
I started when EQ was released.  I had some friends at work who were in beta and bought it the day it came out.  They convinced me a few days after to buy in and give it a shot.  So there I was, a Dark Elf Shadowknight wandering around Neriak.  I could never remember where the bank was LOL Burnished WHAT??  Ohhh it's down the steps here by that bar.. got it.  Wait wait where is the bank again?!?!?  hahaha never forget that.  <br />
<br />
Money.. what a huge problem money was back then.  I save up every copper for WEEKS so I could by a "Scythe" from a vendor in Neriak for 15 plat!  My cursor hovered over the "Buy" button for a few minutes before I committed myself to spending that much money.  Level 9, with a sweet scythe and patchwork gear that my buddy made for me with his shaman.  I was ready for the BIG game... the lesser mummy would be MINE!  No such luck :)  <br />
<br />
One of my fondest memories in EQ is also from those days.  When I finally reached level 15 and got my second set of spells, my shaman buddy and his girlfriend (mage) and I decided we were gonna get saucy.  I'd been a huge fan of Lavastorm.. with the creepy music and cool looking mobs.. so it was time we set foot in Najena!!  Ohhh the horrors that we were to face!  We went in and there was another ubergroup already farther in so some of the stuff was cleared.  We took a few skeletons and elementals out, inflating our egos.  NOTHING could stop us.. we were invincible.  So we get in a little farther and the rooms are empty.  By this time the mage and shaman needed to med for a bit so we found this corner with a pile of dirt in it to hide behind in case anything came for us.  hahaha hide behind the pile of dirt... we REALLY thought this worked.  I decided to stand guard and keep a lookout since they couldnt see anything with their spellbooks up.  Sure enough, around the corner comes this group.. training Tentacle Terrors to the zone.  OH MY GOD WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING NUKING THEM!!!  Holy CRAP that thing is freaky.  My friends stood up and were freaking out.  They'll be back for us!  What do we do??  It's ok.. its cool, we're behind the pile of DIRT!!  They cant see us here.  Minute or so later.. the Tentacle Terrors come back.. slithering past our room.  Nothing aggros!  We're HOME FREE!  The second we go to move, the Tentacle Terror in the room we were in spawns and eats the mage for breakfast.  The shaman and I are hightailing it to zone and run into an ogre who stunned me .. both wound up dying.  Hhaah what a corpse retrieval that was :)<br />
<br />
I soon gave up my shadowknight :(  Tried out a Druid.. they could melee and heal and cast spells.. and got SOW!!  WOW!  So many stories.. so little time to tell them :)<br />
<br />
Maybe we should have a forum just for old school EQ stories hehe have it divided into "Classic EQ" "Kunark Era" "Velious" :)<br />

Yup, as some of you may know, there is a well in the room with Llrodd that takes you all the way to the third floor.

The joke here, ladies and gents was that the raid was never meant to go beyong possibly the 3rd floor of ToFS. Our highest lvl player attending was lvl 50, I believe and an enchanter. A smattering of 45-55's, all other raiders that afternoon were 30-45.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I couldnt figure out how to "click" to get to the next lvl of ToFS when it was time to move on. Being a total newb to the idea of "click zoning" I was upset that I didnt have a key (whatever that was, hehe). Someone in my group however did and they clicked for the group. I remember the panic when the group was a touch out of my reach and zoned up to the next floor without me. The calm chanter near me told me to leave my group (omg, leave my group? nooo! i'll die!) and join him, he would key-click us through and I could re-join my group on the other side.<br />
<br />
I remember the joy in running around, chasing after every mob in the Library smiling and shreaking at the same times.<br />
<br />
*sigh* Sadly, I never learned this zone well. I'll have to go back soon.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ok the other day, I took a friend of mine who is new to EQ to befallen. I had made a Bard to play with him. Anyways, as in my above post about Befallen I decided to take him to the Llrodd camp. Needless to say, I KNEW he was gonna check out the well and I KNEW he was gonna fall in. OMFG, I laughed so hard, I actually hard tears in my eyes. I got my rogue and went down and drug him back up. He sent me a tell after he died and said, "you knew I was gonna do that didn't you?!" Anyway, here is a screen cap I wanted to share.. Man do times like this bring back fond memories.. I just love to remember how we had nothing and thought we had SOMETHING when we got our first piece of cloth or our first Fine Steel sword.. Sadly there aren't many players who ever really experience that part of the game. I made my youngest son start a new character on another server so he could appreciate and understand what I went through so his level 55 twinked out from day one warrior, could have what he has. After about 4 days and only 5 levels, he says "Dad, I think I get it now, I will try harder not to take so much for granted" Well then I felt bad but was glad he understood. Anywho, here's the pic and I will shut up now.<br />

<br />
A young barbarian steps into Blackburrow for the first time. Hey! I'm in cloth, I have a massive rusty 2 handed sword, I can kill some puny gnolls. Hey, these are goin down so easy! Hey, I wonder what's in this tree......<br />
<br />
So after realizing I would never get my vast riches back, I rolled my cleric. Took revenege many times for my fallen barbarian. Grew to a most powerful level of 18 levels and decided it was time to find this den of undead called Unrest that i had heard of. Now mind you, I had never once used my internet for anything other than EQ, so trying to find a map was unheard of! So through rumor, I hopped on the boat and started searching for this fabled dungeon I had heard so much of. <br />
<br />
Well, I found the tunnel in question, the red glow causing me no end of excitement. However the end of the tunnel was solid rock! I just knew Unrest HAD to be here! Must be some trick to zone in....<br />
<br />
I petitioned thinking of course the game was bugged. The guide showed up and asked what the problem was. I told him my predicament and he simply told me to hang on. *BLINK* I was now standing at the crossroads in Butcherblock Mountains! <br />
<br />
"Unrest is somewhere near here. Don't forget to bind. Unrest is NOT off of Toxx Forest." The guide promptly vanished without another word.<br />

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My first char was a DE SK but I couldnt seem to get past level 2 so I gave up on him pretty quickly..... Renic was born, a Bertoxxulous cleric, I liked the idea of an evil cleric of disease. Little did i Know at the time the hassles his faction would cause, hated by non humans for being human, hated by humans for being a berty follower. Faction like being a necro... Ive cursed it many a time since but wouldnt change it for the world....<br />
<br />
<br />
We had not long started a guild, we had no idea what a guild was really for and we only had about 10 members (you didnt even need 10 members in those days). We used to raid Blackburrow as a guild, and have 25people murdering gnolls, we felt so uber.......<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember grouping in the Gorge of King Xorb pre any expansions (sp?)..... We ranged from about level 17 to 24 (Uber!) and were fighting Minotaurs...... Funnily enough it was the same cleric I started to play again recently after almost 2 years not playing........................<br />
<br />
So we are pulling minotaurs, and our lil druid friend is pulling them to the zone to that goblin zone (is that still there?)..... The first time we saw these we nearly crapped ourselves, they were twice our height and hit so hard... we couldnt believe monsters were so big and tough....<br />
<br />
So back to our druid puller, in all honesty he wasnt that great at pulling, usually came waddling back with 2 or 3 in tow, we would all run around screaming, hearts pounding. Skin of our teeth we win a few excellent exciting battles......... Why we didnt get the Paladin  to pull I will never know.....<br />
<br />
So for an hour or so we do this....... Then something we have never seen before, a huge floating eye, OMG! We all panic, and get a little worried, hopefully it didnt see us (not likely with that eye!)..... The druid runs back towards us, the eye in slow pursuit...... Oh no we are going to have to fight it after all... We curse him for pulling it.  Erm why is our little friend hitting me, hey ow, how are you ouch!!!!! Quick kill him lads (and lasses).... We murdered our halfie friend without a thought and then got murdered by the eye and a charmed paladin......... It was scary but most of all it was hilarious... I laughed for ages after.....  Ahh the good old days....<br />
<br />
I remember at level 9 getting bored with Qeynos and deciding to make a run for it, now sow nothing. I had no idea what was there, my dodgy map that came with EQ suggested that somewhere called Highhold was somewhere out there. So I started running, got half way across WC and a big cat turned me into catfood.... I had to get my corpse, uber bronze mace (some uber guy in all bronze had given it to me!) and leather armour could not be sacrificed! So i got the corpse, and made my way carefully and painstakingly across WC, NK, EK etc and up the ramps into HHP..... Kindly player, asks what I am doing here, I say I fancied a change and would like to get bound so I dont have to run all the way back.   He binds me at some inn and I go for a wander... Ahh a gnoll I know what they are......... Oh its RED... Nm wander some more.... Erm its all red...... Bad mistake, Im stuck in a nasty place..... I want to go home to Qeynos.... :(</td>

I remember hanging out in high hold pass with him the day he quit and i got his e-mail and everything,<br />
but time just seems to split things and you forget about people and things that shouldnt be forgotten.<br />
<br />
i miss so much. <br />
<br />
its all lost in a heartbeat.<br />

gone forever.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I started only last chrismtmas, pop was available but I didnt have or know about, having just the eq classic trial program. Have to say it was probably the most fun I had in this, running around Qeynos and its areas with Renaden. The atmosphere was friendlier also, as the trial program was on a magazine that had just come out, so we were a bunch of noobs all at the same time.<br />
Hehe there were some classic moments, the blackburrow gnoll trains, a member of the party accidently pressing 'a' when trying to talk to an npc, being scared half to death by a giant spider, unaware of what indifferent meant,and the universally feared Holly Windstalker. Think my favourite was when we were trying to kill a scarecrow in WK, for my newbie armour quest. It was going fine, the necros pet was tanking, and I was healing the pet, but alas, Tiny the troll spotted us, and wasn't too happy about it. Well at least we didnt get time to feel any pain lol.<br />
<br />
Its odd, the whole game felt a lot smaller when I bought the pop expansion. Freeport didn't feel like a city that was a large trek away, the other continents were available in seconds. I enjoyed it at first, but now kind of long for the old days (er 7 months ago). maybe soe should make a server that doesnt have pop activated or something, I think it would be surprisingly popular.</td>

It took me a while, but I eventually figured out what I was feeling!!  Remember that nervous feeling in the pit of your stomach when you went to a zone you had never been in before, where you didnt know your way round, where you didn't know what would smack you?  It was fantastic - so great to go to a zone I had never been before with this char or any of my otheres; and so great to know that feeling is still out there!

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've been playing since early 1999.   I'd go back to do it all over again in a heartbeat.  To experience all the new things again.  (Maybe one reason I have all the alts I do)  <br />
<br />
As a level 3 human warrior... Dunamis... I ventured into North Ro and found my way to the Inn and its protective guards.  I would solo an armadillo or coyote... and while sitting and resting I would listen in fascination to the shouts and requests from people wanting others to join them for a Dervish group.  Dervish?  That same evening there was a group wanting more people to join them at the "plat".  Sending a tell I awkwardly ask them if I could come to the plat.  Sure.. we need a tank.  (Tank?)  Oh, Im a warrior..... They asked me to come on over.  "Ive never been to the plat before"  Oh.. well... maybe later....  (Oh how I miss the days of people wanting to GROUP to kill scarabs and spiders at the plat)  So I received a tell from two more warriors to join them.  With my focus on following the guy in front of me I had no idea where I had gone from the Inn, and being seperated got lost and ran into a Puma... it was ugly.  10 mins later after I had zoned in ( I ran a way slow PC with a dial up then) I went looking for my body....literally sweating I ran over hill after hill loooking... (I had been given 18pp and thought I was sooo rich I just HAD to find my body)  It was again getting dark, so I see a group people near a tent... hmm this must be a "Derv group".  (Consider?)  I run up and say "Hail, A Dervish Cutthroat"... no reply.  Hail him again... then I ask "have you seen my corspe anywhere near here?"  <br />
<br />
Finally I met a great cleric frined that showed me a few ropes and got me on the right track to leveling and grouping.  Orc camps in east common, so hard to get into... groups of level 5's struggling to kill all the adds, yet having the time of our little lives.  Fought with the same group of people (roughly) for my first Derv camp (oh these are the bad guys) and stayed up for my first all nighter.  Madde at least 25pp that night... man what a haul!  <br />
<br />
I will never forget my first sight of a Hill Giant in West Commons.  Id heard rumor of them,  and heard others run from them, but not until I ventured to the Toll Booth had I ever seen one.  Fascinating. <br />
<br />
At level 17 I decided I needed a magic weapon.  I sold everything I had on me, plus emptied the bank for a Shiny Brass Halbred for 150pp, and the guy SWORE he was giving it away!  I spent the next two and half weeks killing wisps and selling the GLS for 3pp 8gp... (What... quest in NK?)<br />
<br />
Geared up now after all the hundreds of wisps that had returned GLS, we moved on to HH pass.  So scary.  I wanted back out into the "safety" of Kithicor.  Here I hunted with the same group I had been until about the time we all got our surnames.  We were too cool.  Then to the Bird villiage of SK.  How many can remember there actually being severl full groups hunting there?  <br />
<br />
I ramble and am sorry... this was such a fun thread to read.  So many stories to tell.  <br />

The mood I felt after reading your posting I think echoes what I feel the most about the game and how things and people have changed.  Perhaps one of the saddest realizations of all was /telling a friend you use to group with all the time and saying "hi, where/how've you been?" and then after an awkward pause... receiving a tell back that "oh I'm sorry this isnt that person.... I'm... playing this character now".  I was so sickened to my stomach.  And it wasnt the last time that had happened.  <br />

Yes, the wonder of the world is forever lost.<br />
<br />
I've been playing EQ since the release of SoV.  We all seem to enjoy many of the same memories.  The long runs accross Anontica to get from FP to Qeynos just to see what it looked like.  <br />
<br />
However, my favorote experiance would have to be my first dungeon.  Split Paw.  I couldn't tell you if it was revamped at this point or if that happened way before I came along but I was so scared.  I was a playing a wizard at the time and was so excited to actually be in a dungeon!  I can't even tell you what the other circumstances around me where (group memebers or levels) all I know is that I was actually in a dungeon.  Ended up camping the BR for a few hours and thinking to myself, to hell with this, I wanna go check out the rest of this place cause its so cool!   Nope, that didn't work.  Going though that double door was bad.  <br />
<br />
<br />
On the other side of things, I now play on Stromm to try to relive some of that newbishness.  Hasn't worked too well as I now have 3 characters above level 40 in the short 3 months that the server has been opened.  I wish Sony would open a server that only had The old world active on it, only allowed to Level to 50 and all that...Just like it used to be including manastones and whatnot.  Take away all the revamps and just make it the old way and then gradually reintroduce the expansions again.  I would jump on that server and play there in a heart beat as I'm sure alot of you would too.</td>

GLSs were a fabulous treasure at the time.  What are we supposed to do with them?  Someone says something about a gypsy lady in North Karana.  Where the heck is North Karana?  When I have a few bags full of these things, I offer some bard a GLS to show me where this place is.  Along the way I see massive fire beetles, huge spiders, something called a treant, then WHAM.. both of us pounded into the ground by a Hill Giant.  After recoving corpses and scanning the area for dangers, we proceed along the path (sticking religiously to the path, mind you) to North Karana, and I rake in a treasure trove of 500pp!</td>

I kinda miss the days of hanging out in EC tunnel and fighting orcs while looking at the auctions. It was strangely fun to wait in line for someone to show you what they had to sell. AND WHAT ABOUT OLD SHADY?! HOW DO YOU THINK HE FEELS ABOUT BAZAAR? imagine how lonely he is /sigh <br />
<br />
I also remember the first time i saw my friend play. He had the little iksar newbie war weapon with 8 dmg 40 dly. WHen i saw him hitting for 16, i thought WHOA THATS AWSOME! So i got EQ a month later and made a iksar war. I promptly fell in a moat and couldn't escape. I camped underwater and deleted that guy forever. /dead <br />

THe old days could be sooooo fun, but it is more efficient now. o well now EQs a new game <br />

btw if you play on innoruuk send Slowdjoo or Saeven a tell if you want to join the super guild, Olath Van'lerg. We accept anyone!</td>
