<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I regularly group with a monk, berserker and ranger.  The berserker is hugely twinked and generally suffices as an adequate tank, despite not having taunt.  However, the monk especially, and less often the ranger, frequently requires healing.  I've mentioned that the monk's generating so much aggro is a] very inefficient as far as healing goes b] dangerous when I'm CHing and c] preventable.  When I've brought it up I've been met with a lot of resistance - the last time the monk demanded again why it mattered if I had to heal him regularly, and the berserker responded by saying curtly "She's just being lazy."<br />
<br />
The monk is a good friend of mine and has very little experience in the high end game - this char is his highest level at 48.  Nowadays, with KEI and other perks I understand that it seems like senseless bitching usually, as typically mana is not a problem for me.  But I remember the days when mana efficiency was of utmost importance, and I can't help but feel like he hasn't learned to manage his own aggro yet because he's never been in group situations where his drawing attention meant that he either died, or the group was unsuccessful.  Even when grouped with a warrior or other MT that can taunt, I've still noticed him requiring significant healing.<br />
<br />
Am I right that his drawing aggro is preventable?  I don't know enough about the tricks of the monk trade to tell him specifically what he can do to help the problem... but I know I've grouped with plenty of monks, rangers, and rogues who have managed to hand out damage without taking much of it.  Or perhaps without a taunter it really is out of his hands?<br />
<br />
Or maybe I *am* just being lazy? &#123;whut} <br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">whether or not you're being lazy depends on your motivation for pointing it out to him I suppose... but the fact remains that you are correct that his lack of aggro management skills can only lead to trouble when he moves into situations that are more challenging.<br />
<br />
Learning where that edge of the aggro envelope is and riding it without going over it is a major part of the job of any DPS class; how much respect would you have for a wizard who chain cast nukes from the start of every fight and ganked aggro constantly?<br />
<br />
Any DPS class has some control over their aggro: choosing when to attack, when to stop attacking, fighting from max melee distance, switching to slower weapons and/or ones without procs, etc. Monks have a few nice tools in addition to that, notably feign death, to help them ditch aggro at will.<br />
<br />
If the monk doesn't want to FD or stop attacking for a sec to lose aggro because he wants to maximize the kill rate, he needs to learn the real effects of what he is doing. Is he attacking from the front of the mob? if so, then he's needlessly being parried and riposted etc and losing damage that way. If not, then every time he ganks aggro he disrupts the damage output for himself and the rest of the melees as the mob spins around and faces those who need to be behind him. If they adjust to compensate, then they are further disrupted when the MT regains aggro and spins the mob back around. Pets especially will be affected by facing the front of the mob and not being able to adjust. Needless to say, this annoyance turns deadly when a mob that enrages is flipped around at the wrong moment.<br />
<br />
Any braindead moron can buy up the best gear around, hit autoattack and spam the special attack keys; showing me your uber DPS really doesn't impress me that much. Showing me how well you can ride the line of maximizing damage without ganking aggro and I'll perk up and take notice.</td>

<br />
You might try this sometime (after first discussing it with him and explaining what you are doing).  During a normal group xp session simply do not heal him - at all.  At some point, he will begin to manage his aggro due to seeing his health bar moving in the wrong direction and his Mend not available.  As I said though, in deference to your friendship, make sure you talk it out with him ahead of time and that there is an understanding of why you are doing this.  Make it a challenge to him to get through a session without being healed.<br />
<br />
Be reasonable about it of course.  If there is a bad pull or other circumstances not of his making - well, you get the drift. <br />
<br />
If that doesn't work or he objects to that tactic then I suggest you roleplay being teamed with the drunken monk who cannot control his anger.  :D</td>

First, why do you play with this group regularly if they sit around insulting you and accusing you of being lazy?<br />
<br />
Second, as for non-MTing DPS classes, in general, while it may take more of a learning curve for classes like rangers, pallys, SK, warriors and zerks, neither a monk or a rogue should be pulling agro. Period.<br />
<br />
I think part of the problem out there is some people who are not the MT at the time WANT to pull agro to show others how much damage they are really doing and/or how ub3r or l33t they are.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hehe.  Well these responses have degenerated into... errr...  what we're all thinking.  :p<br />
<br />
But taking a slightly different approach...  Yes, lack of taunt makes a *huge* difference when you're trying to drop aggro.  My rogue has seen taunters than can't hold aggro and non-taunters that can, but as a general rule, taunters are much better.  That said, I rarely have *major* problems dropping aggro when I want to.  It's a matter of timing things correctly.  And as much as I hate giving up that extra dps, I do it if I have to.<br />
<br />
Assuming that he is trying but having trouble losing aggro to the berserker, I would expect the monk to take the odd hit here or there, but nothing that mend can't fix as it pops up (my rogue has an 80hp lifetap that keeps her gtg through damage shields (unless we don't have a debuffer - they're nasty if the battle lasts too long...) and the occasional hit between backstab and evade).  I would expect that once (maybe twice) in an ldon time period, he would get aggro he couldn't drop (say, right after he gets up from FD) and require a heal.  But based on my rogue's experience, it really shouldn't be more than that - assuming that the berserker is also trying to *gain* aggro.<br />
<br />
I've never been to the high-end game either (highest char is 51 right now - AA points, woot!), and I admit that for the first 20 or 30 levels, my rogue did everything she could to gain aggro.  I was "proving my uberness" *blush* and "working on my defense".  Then I grew up and learned.  ;P  Sounds like the monk is behind the learning curve for this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to be mean, let the group (as a group, not in tells - everyone should be aware of this one, I think) know that you will only heal the MT.  If you see that someone is trying their utmost to lose aggro, you will make an exception - otherwise, you have a rez.  Or better yet, go in without clarity once.  Then perhaps it will truly be a matter of mana efficiency, and you won't have to be "mean".  ;)  <br />
<br />
Like I said, I haven't been to the high-end, but I have seen just enough to know that I don't wanna get any aggro I can't drop at a moment's notice.  ;)  Rogues have the advantage of being able to evade without losing more than a second or two of combat.  I think monks have it a little bit harder with FD, but I see monks I group with use it all the time when things go wrong.  Everything I have read about monks says that the primary rule is DGH (Don't Get Hit).  At level 48, it's time for this one to learn.</td>

Aggro bouncing is pretty annoying when it can be prevented. When faced with this issue and no backup healer, I'll announce 'Please remember, there is no backup healer so be careful with the aggro.' If they care or are paying attention, they'll note that every cheal you cast on the tank takes up 10 seconds of your time, that cannot be used to heal someone else. Or, they'll find out that it takes less than ten seconds for a non plate class to die.<br />

There is no excuse for a monk over level 17 to take aggro unnecessarily.  None whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Monks can FD, stand back up again, and start attacking immediately.  FD works like evade:  It lowers aggro even if the monk stands up and attacks again at once.<br />
<br />
However, it IS efficient for the monk to use Mend every time it repops; it's a mana-free heal.  Every six minutes the monk can regain 25% (or sometimes more, with AA) of his or her hp at the press of a button.  So many clerics make it a rule to let the monk Mend rather than heal.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, this particular situation is more complex.  There's no taunt tank in the group - so the monk MIGHT take it that it's his job to be higher on the aggro list than the cleric, in case the berserker dies.  In that case, the monk might well choose not to lower aggro through the use of FD, for good reasons.<br />

Blaming the cleric for being lazy is not very smart for any mellee class. Even the dumbest trolls soon learn the more time we can spend meding is more mana for when it is really needed. <br />

Hmmmm...  So not to hijack, but... well, I'm gonna mini-hijack.  :p  In the higher-end game, is cleric aggro a huge problem?  So far I've rarely had any trouble dropping it (assuming I only take it in the first place on rare occasions like tank death).  DA/DB...  not to mention root - or a quick stun to buy time to cast...  Should a non-tanking melee class really be concerned with staying higher on the list than the cleric?</td>

Cleric agro comes from 2 major sources; meding and cheal. PoI is a good example of meding agro. Those darn pieces of metal junk love taking after a cleric who is just trying to do her job and increase mana to save her team mates. The team needs some one to protect the cleric from this and I have a very favourite ranger who loves to do this for me! Of course many settings you can minimize meding agro by using your trusty mount. You can also mimize the agro by standing up while the pull is incoming and then pop back down again when agro is re-established.<br />
<br />
The other agro comes from complete heals. A cleric soon learns how to time the heals so that one of the tanks has agro enough that the MOB does not take it into its dim brain to switch targets. However there are times when your MT is dropping fast and there is an add unaccounted for. This is when you better have DA or DB up and ready to fire!!</td>

You do learn to time heals to avoid aggro, but sometimes, you just have to heal and trust the melees do their job peeling the mobs off you, and hug DA/DB when necessary.  Sometimes the tank is the puller and tags the next mob just before the heal hits -- healing 5k or 6k or 7k of HP as the mob is coming in = big OUCH for the cleric.  Or the chanter gets aggro and you have no choice but to heal as fast and as much as you can, and the mob decides you look like a crunchy snack.<br />
<br />
Sit aggro is the major reason you should have a mount in PoP.  Those wind-up toys in PoI really do love to smack a sitting cleric.  I've never even tried to sit in BoT.<br />

I've only done a couple of PoJ trials, but every single wave, I got heal aggro the first time I had to heal.  I tried a couple different tacks on that; even HoTs got me smacked.<br />

I do heal him when he scares me ( pulling and getting back to the group at 20 % life ) but other then messy mistakes or bad pulls I spend very very little mana on him ever. He is so good at agro controll but when a MT goes down he grabs agro right fast until someone else locks down the mob so I can keep healing with out worry of heal agro.<br />
<br />
I never understood the lazy comments when it comes to clerics. I am lazy cause I want mana to heal you with ? that never made sense to me.  What is a cleric with an empty mana bar ? a really crappy MT ?  With out mana we are useless to our main job of healing , so when I have none I dont see that as being lazy as I spent it all healing or i wouldnt be LOM. I am also very sledom LOM so when i am it is clear to me that something isnt being done right (unless an over pull or something else uncommon)I tend to group in the same spot allot as I love it and also with the same people most days , so my mana use per mob is old news to me and I have a normal use rate that I see in my normal camp spot so when it gets all out of wack due to someone who cant controll their agro and I get LOM is it clear what the problem is. <br />
<br />
The people I normally group with like fast nonstop pulls , they like 1 mob sitting waiting for its death as the one we kill dies. They dont take kindly to clerics that complain LOM all the time so they expect others to do their jobs so mana isnt an issue.  In my normal group I am melee and nuking and doing all heals for the group and never run into lom issues unless someone isnt doing their job. We sometimes pick up a 6th if we have a spot or I dont feel like 2 boxing my chanty and if that 6th person slows us down they wont be offered a group with us again. It isnt a snob like attitude it is a simple we want exp for our time spent and when everyone does their jobs there is no problem. We have met and added many people to out grouping list , thats how I always have a common group to play with. <br />
<br />
Heal agro is a big thing at higher levels , max that defence skill !  My fav trick for heal agro is a stun and then root off me. As I see the mob running at me with lust for my blood in its eyes I stun him and laugh at the fact he will never get to eat me  as I root him where he stands :) on raids I have my divines loaded so if needed I can cast one of those but in exp groups my stun , root always gives me enough time for a chanter or MT to get it off me. Also now that I have DA I use that sometimes when a heal is needed before enough agro can be built to heal safely, DA,Cel regen and everyone is happy again.<br />

I think your friends are going to learn a few lessons soon and they will understand what you are talking about . Life pre pop is very different then post POP, I remember when I though horses were just a status symbol . I swore I would never own a horse as it was a true waste of PP, then I decided to go and group for the first time in a POP zone. Well can u say BAM POW (insert comic strip here with hero getting beaten to red dust) I learned very fast what a horse can provide you, and also that POP was like nothing I had ever encountered before . I had to relearn how to play my class basically and at first I felt like I was never going to get it and be able to survive in a POP zone. Now I feel i have learned how to be a good cleric in pop and I love it and feel safe in most of the zones  but it took time and learning. As we level our class changes very slightly and you have to learn and change as you go so knowing how to play a cleric in GD isnt going to help you much in POP as the heal strat changes due to the mob damage out put, try starting a cheal at 30 to 40 % life in BOT :) to see what i mean. <br />
<br />
So what I am saying in my normal long winded fashion is we learn thru our whole game lives and when people start to say at level 50ish that they know what they are doing and cant be taught anything that is sad ,as the game changes so must we . I am level 65 and have 52 Aa`s and am 2 kills from elemental access and I stil learn about my class and the game every day . I never say I know my class dont tell me anything , I listen to advice given and even try it out before I say BAh my way is fine thanks , I have learned some kewl things lately by accepting advice when offered and will keep doing so until the day I retire Fairy.</td>

I would be more concerned with the zerker.  Leg-chop's and head strikes should be enough to draw and maintain agro over the cleric, and they are practicaly FREE (since the stacks of regents for axes are dirt cheap).  The monk is a moron for trying to tank, since the changes went in, reducing them to barely better than paper-tanks.  The Zerker, being twinked as you said, is a chain class, with possibly more AC available to them.  making them the better choice to tank.  Moreso since I would venture a guess to say that the monk needs to start training FD, or he's going to die more and more, unneededly.</td>

When you're healing against trash mobs that quad for 1200+, you're often going to die from your fast heals because there isn't enough time for someone else to generate enough agro to keep the mobs off...especially when you're healing a caster like the enchanter.  There are a lot of cases, where you won't even live long enough for your spell gems to cycle and try to get DA off.  I just bought BDA and that might help since it's not a spell per se and you don't have to wait for the gems to refresh.<br />
<br />
As for the monk, as others have said, he should be using FD to drop agro as long as there is no danger of handing the agro to a non-tank.  When I pull, I typically wait until I see the tank use incite or see a hate proc before I FD and transfer agro to the MT...unless we are in the situation described above where my monk wouldn't survive that long.  In those cases, I FD the mob far enough away that it doesn't prox agro the group and let the tank pull the mob into the group himself.</td>

The reaction of my friend to my bringing this issue up in group didn't really surprise me, as I'd already tried approaching it gently with him and we butted heads.  This time, the third time, I was feeling very irritated and chose to approach it the way many of you suggested: by saying in group that if he continued to take aggro and off-tank unnecessarily, that I wouldn't be healing him.  Needless to say, he didn't take kindly to that approach.  The berserker didn't either, which I can't really blame him for, as this was the first he'd heard of it and he was catapulted into an argument that made me look bitchy and my friend look warranted. (One thing I didn't mention is that my friend and I are exes, so we act like grouchy siblings together more often than I'd like to admit.) The lazy comment did really bother me, though, to the extent that I disbanded shortly thereafter and haven't grouped with them since.<br />
<br />
The issue here isn't that my friend is concerned with showing off, playing tank, or protecting me from healing aggro - it's that he just doesn't know any better.  He thinks the idea of fd'ing in the middle of combat is nonsensical and counterproductive, and he doesn't know why he would keep things from hitting him when he's a melee class.  He uses FD to save his arse when we're "evacing" or when he's solo and uses it well, but when it comes to regular combat situations it doesn't occur to him.  Even when his HPs drop within near-to-dying range and he knows I'm busy healing others, he never FDs. Ever.  He hasn't seen many other monks in action and simply doesn't know that such strategies are used.  And since he hasn't yet died because of his play style, he doesn't think it needs to be altered.<br />

lol at the first comment. :)<br />

As for the second, I agree, good to know you did leave the group shortly after. My husband plays a monk, and has been gaining aggro with his new weopons/augs...but its not very hard for him to hit that FD key when he does gain aggro. FD, stand hit auto attack again. There you go...no more aggro problems, no mana spent unnecessarily. Rather lazy of a monk who doesn't want to do that.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, a monk who is gaining aggro, and doing nothing to avoid aggro, is the lazy one.  Like you said in your last post, its not that hard to FD.<br />
<br />
I group with someone frequently who always gets aggro off the MT as well.  Always in there casting their debuffs etc and melee'ing before the mob is even at the MT.  I've even mentioned several times, "So-and-so is the MT, everyone else please watch your aggro."<br />
<br />
She died rather quick on the last raid we did. Heck of a way to learn to not cast every spell memmed right away when your not the MT. I couldn't rez her 'till the dragon was dead. We also lost that DPS for the rest of the fight...for no good reason.<br />
<br />
Bad habits like that, when you can change them, is just plain lazyness.  Almost a sure sign they're going to do something stupid when avoiding aggro and helping to convserve mana really counts.<br />
<br />
My advice..which you don't have to follow. :) Just stop healing the monk, he's got mend and FD.  My husband and I growl at each other sometimes...and sometimes I do stop healing him when he's not listening to his group cleric.   &#123;whistle}<br />
