<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Im new to the cleric class, I am currently a lvl 25 Halfling cleric on Stromm. I have a question about aggro. Before lvl 24 i never once got aggro from healing, now that I have Greater Healing I'm constantly pulling aggro (well more than I would like). I do not nuke or cast any other spell but often my first Gheal to the MT will give me aggro..even using the Soothe line I'm still WAAAAAAYY up on the hate list. It happens a lot in groups with no warrior with a bard or sk type tanking, but even last night with a warrior 8 levels above me a few times the first heal when the warrior was at like 70% health I would get aggro.<br />
<br />
Am I supposed to wait to heal longer, as even tho I could heal to full health with 2 casts tanks still seem to get nervous and start asking to be healed around 70%.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Well, first off, you can't let the Tank dictate when and how to use your spells. A tank that is nervous at 70% health will be near useless in the higher end game where mobs can drop a tank to 70% health in a single tick/round.<br />
<br />
The first thing I do with a new tank is find out what their Max Hitpoints are, then calculate approx how many % the heals I plan to use will replace in a single cast. If your gheal adds 50% to his total max hitpoints and he's asking for heals at 70% health, then your wasteing mana. That mana could spell life or death for your group in an emergency.<br />
<br />
As for the Agro, my personal Pet (lv 49 warrior, hehe he'd kill me if he saw I called him that LOL) continually "Taunts" during a battle. That seems to keep the mob focused on him and not me even after a Heavy Heal. Using this method, I can usually Med out of Combat range, Stand, Cast my chosen heal spell, then sit and med until the next heal is required.<br />
<br />
Playing "Agro-tag" is something that all casters face and have to learn by experience. Sometimes, the mob is just determined to pound on the caster/Cleric. In these circumstances, it's important not to panic and run or not to attack as it will make the mob all the much harder for the Tank to regain Agro again.<br />
<br />
Hope at least some of this helps and good luck!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73"><font color="skyblue">Something else to remember is that the Soothe line is an aggro radius reducer, not an aggro wiper.  It's pretty much wasted mana if you're casting it on a mob the melee has already engaged.  Aggro radius doesn't seem to matter a whole bunch once you make the mob's Hate/Aggro list.  The only spell that works along the lines of that is "Atone"; that puts you towards the bottom of the list, but does <b>not</b> removed you from it.  I have rarely had a use for this spell yet, so perhaps some others can provide insight on it.</font></td>

<br />
 In theory it wipes the hate list completely which obviously can entail a ton of problems. Example: blur just for a wiz drops a big nuke guess who dies. Great for travel though pick up a bogey np root blur a few times go on about your business. <br />
<br />
 I would assume though that atone isn't anywhere near as effective as chanter blurs and only causes a partial wipe possibly dropping you below the tank and somewhat removing  the hate you've built up. Would appreciate it though if any experienced clerics would clear that up for me though since its just my theory.</td>

<tr class="archivebody">
<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Mobs have a hate list and they generally attack the person at the top of the hate list. When you are healing with greater heal, you are moving yourself above the tank on the hate list, therefore the mob is attacking you.  Mirias suggested using the spell atone.  Atone is a memblur spell which basically erases the mobs hate list and would be the worst thing you could do.  Casting atone will wipe all the aggro the tank has built and make the mob attack someone other than the tank.<br />
<br />
Managing heal aggro is one the skills that clerics learn early and will need to continue to refine throughout the game.  If your tank is a warrior, make sure he knows about Taunt and that he should be taunting constantly.  If your tank is a knight,, they should be using their spells to build aggro.  <br />
<br />
Healing too early is often the reason why clerics get aggro.  As someone said, you know your spells and don't let the tank tell you how to heal them.  I got eaten by Fennin Ro the other for just that reason.  We started the rotation on the pull and one of my early heals hit the MA before she took damage because I was on my horse and channeled through the heal that I tried to interrupt by moving.  The tank lost aggro for a second and FR ate the wizzy that nuked too soon, then ate me and another cleric before heading back to the MA.  You are the cleric and you know how much your heals do and when to use them.  And you are learning what happens when you use them incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Sit aggro is another biggy.  If you need to med after healing the tank, watch the mob.  If he turns to you when you sit, stand up fast. (Make a sit/stand hot key.)  The combination of your heal aggro plus the sitting aggro just moved you above the tank on the hate list.  <br />
<br />
Another skill that you can learn now (and makes tanks love you)while raising your defense is to learn NOT TO RUN when you are getting hit.  A tank can't taunt the mob off of you if you running in circles like a dress wearer.  If you get aggro, stand there and let the tank taunt.  If the tank can't, root the mob and then move.</td>

<b>Mirias suggested using the spell atone.  Atone is a memblur spell which basically erases the mobs hate list and would be the worst thing you could do.  Casting atone will wipe all the aggro the tank has built and make the mob attack someone other than the tank.</b></td></tr></table> <br />
<br />
 Please check my post again I said they were very touchy spells and gave an example of a bad use of them. It can save things but must be used VERY sparingly. Sorry if I offended you Dulcinea just trying to clear up some confusion.<br />

<b>Managing heal aggro is one the skills that clerics learn early and will need to continue to refine throughout the game.  If your tank is a warrior, make sure he knows about Taunt and that he should be taunting constantly.  If your tank is a knight,, they should be using their spells to build aggro.</b>[/QUOTE]   <br />
<br />
 I cant agree more and thats the main reason im 39 and have never even loaded atone and havent used it. Memblurs aren't all bad just need to be used properly and that takes time and experience.</td>

This is a fallacy.  Most of the time, taunt does not increase the warrior's aggro totals at all.<br />
<br />
If the warrior is not the top of the hate list, then a successful taunt has a chance of putting them to the top.  In other words: when you've just engaged, the Warrior might have 1000 hate points and the Rogue 800 hate points; everyone else nil.  If the Warrior taunts successfully, he is still on 1000 hate points.<br />
<br />
Then the shaman slows the critter.  All of a sudden, the Shaman has 2500 hate and the critter starts thumping her.<br />
<br />
If your warrior has been mashing the taunt key every time it pops up, then the taunt key is greyed out, and the warrior can do nothing to save the shaman apart from /shield her.  But if your warrior has been saving taunt for when it's needed, he can immediately press the key.  If the taunt succeeds, the warrior has 2501 hate, the shaman 2500, the rogue 800, and everyone else nil.<br />
<br />
This is fact, and I have personally tested it with my warrior.  It's also been tested rather more thoroughly by the warriors at <a href="http://xwarzone.steelwarrior.com" target="_blank">the warrior messageboards</a>.  Warriors who mindlessly mash the taunt key every time it refreshes will get you killed.<br />
<br />
Back on topic:<br />
<br />
Every cleric knows what it's like to have a tank who's not holding aggro.  There comes a time (rather frequently in a cleric's life) when you have to cast that heal in the sure and certain knowledge that one or more critters are going to thump you for it.  You need to learn how to cope with that.<br />
<br />
1.  The spells Divine Aura and Divine Barrier will help you to shed aggro because they give your tank some chances to taunt.<br />
<br />
2.  Wear armour with large amounts of AC and HP wherever possible so you can take a pounding.<br />
<br />
3.  Root:  It's a surprisingly powerful aggro management tool.  Use it, learn to love it.  <i>A rooted critter will always attack the closest opponent.</i>  Root it, move back, and sit down again.  By the time root wears off, your tank has had some time to build more aggro.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm level 65 and root spells have a permanent place in my spell lineup, even on raids.</td>

Shadow makes a lot of sense with the taunt. Another thing that a good warrior knows is the use of Beg as a way to taunt. It doesnt do a whole lot, but it definately helps. A warrior worth his grain will have a fairly high Beg skill.</td>

<br />
So very true, the longer you can wait before having to heal the tank will give them that much more time to build up their aggro.  Even at 65 healing Brick Sh*thouses for tanks, if I land that heal a lil too early the mobs will be all over me.  I also remember when I was your lvl and tanks would start saying in group "Heal me!" or "Plz heal me now."  Talk about getting me mad.  I hated when  a tank thought they new our class better than us.  If they continue to do that, the time they dont say it dont heal them so when they die and they ask why you didnt heal them, say "Well you didnt tell me to."  When they say you should know when to heal tell them you realized you didnt know how to play a cleric so you were depending on them. ;( <br />
<br />
So make sure you keep the tank "topped off" before the pull that way they have more time to build aggro.  If that doesnt work then try the root route.<br />
