"I'll heal you when I see a red, not before. I need most of my mana to heal people who don't have a more mana efficient HoT than me. What? No Stoicism? Why are you here and not in Dulak camping your flask?"<br />
<br />
Yeah, can't imagine a shammy demanding a heal when they canni (in most situations). Hell, most of us don't <i>want</i> you to, and have to be reminded that Cleric heals are largely more effecient than ours, and it's really ok if the cleric tosses a heal our way.<br />
<br />
The Shaman I group with fairly regularly (other than Shazzog, of course) understands that I will heal him, like it or not, in two circumstances: When a MoB is in camp, and I see him going into the red, or when I am full mana and his HP drops low enough that my heal won't quite fully heal him.<br />
<br />
The rest of the time, he is on his own, and likes it that way. I wasthe one that MQ'd Stoicism with him, and he still thanks me for it. 660-800hp for 150 mana, over 4-6 seconds and he can take care of himself usually. Plus act as backup healer if Shazzog isn't around. (When my warriors see Stoicism land on them now, they know it's time take a quick break...and I try never to let that happen)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I live with a Shaman lol.  A very very good Shaman at that.  Living with and playing with him side by side has taught me a lot about the way he thinks of his class.<br />
<br />
No doubt, "hey cleric" is a rude way to address ANYONE, but have ya seen what a lev 65 Shaman goes through? LOL.  If you have played a shaman you know.  Especially if you have played a high level shaman in a decent size raid.  They are literally like the "town pump".  My BF doesn't usually get "asked" for buffs, he usually gets told, and he hates it.  He loves the class, he loves playing the shaman class.<br />
<br />
He runs low on mana constantly.  Of course he can "canni" and he sits there and hits the button over and over and over....but even then its hard to catch up sometimes when he is casting Malo, Slow, dots...and then hes buffing, sta, agi, haste...I get in a group and the group wants HoV, no prob, 1/2 my mana, gone, ok, I med.  He gets in the same group and gets tells and demands in group for everything in his spell book!  I rarely get asked for anything else in a group other than heals and HoV.<br />
<br />
I may be bias, but be nice to your shamans, yeah maybe this guy was a bit rude, but just because he can canni and gain mana back doesn't mean hes running FM all the time.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, your shaman buffs up everyone, canni's to get mana back, he drops in HPs.  For shamans HP's = mana.  The tank pulls, the cleric didn't heal the shaman, the shaman now needs to slow.  Slow = aggro.  A few hits and hes dead.  A shaman can make or break a group if hes good at what he does.  I have seen many a cleric die, and I have watched the shaman keep the entire group alive and the mobs controlled, even with several adds.  <br />
<br />
I heal whatever shaman is in my group.  If he is using canni I wait until hes down low and then I hit him with a quick heal, even if it doesn't bring him to full HP's.  Shamans like regen items, and they cast regen, he will probably heal in time in a couple minutes anyway if he just has a little health missing.  They appreciate being healed, its one less thing they have to worry about.  I wouldn't always assume because he has a heal spell as well that you shouldn't heal him.  If hes getting hit, make sure your on him with heals, because hes probably pissed off that slow didn't land...or something...lol<br />
<br />
Sorry for rambling its late, and I guess I am just bias to shamans and healing them and taking care of them.  They do a lot for a group and a raid.  I would rather go into a dungeon in LDoN without a chanter than without a shaman.<br />

I heal shaman no matter if they tell me not to.  They canni because they've used their mana to buff (yeah, everyone, and so many buffs) and that all important slow, plus everything else they do.  They deserve my mana no less than the tank  (and really, without the shaman, that tank would be using probably twice as much of my mana).</td>

It sucks a little hp off the group and replenishes what the shaman used to regain his/her mana. If the shaman is about to see his end I'll heal or if he falls down below 45. Most of the time I have no problems with shamans. As stated before, shamans, for the most part, do not attract the retards and morons.</td>

<br />
When in full groups it all depends on the group.  Some groups don't have the best tanks or make bad pulls often creating the need for more heals.  When I am having trouble keeping up I let the shammy know he is on his own, just as I would a necro doing the same.  Of course if they gain agro I help out.  In a group where mana is not a concern I heal the shammy with out asking.</td>

If he is having to constatnly canni then he's likely staying low on mana and healing himself wouldn't be as efficient if you aren't running low. I could understand him demanding it if you were letting him stay at low health and he clearly wasn't going to be healing himself.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In exp grps with VoQ I almost never have a problem with mana. Example was last night in BoT, I was healing the tank, casting a pet and chain nuking condemnation on the mobs and mana was always in the 50-75% range. We had a shaman who was keeping everyone buffed, maloing the mobs, slowing, dotting and healing me if I had aggro (chain nukes sometimes do that, hehe) Anyway, he was always using Canni between pulls to replenish his mana, and since I had plenty it was not a problem for me to Elixir him or do a quick Remedy. I even created a hot key for him "Healing the Shaman, Enjoy the Meal".<br />
<br />
When I heal a shaman I view it as sort of a reverse necro twitch.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My cleric laughs at me when I cannibalize...  sometimes she tries to time Divine Arbitration so it goes off between the /gsay message that I'm cannibalizing and when Cann V finishes casting so I get low health aggro and die.  Then she casts revive on me for being stupid and killing myself.<br />
<br />
If I ask for a heal she laughs, nukes a mob, and says "there's your heal, beeyotch, now IoS me"<br />
<br />
But she specced evocation anyway so I guess that's more efficient.<br />
<br />
Before she gives me virtue, first she gets ten peridots.  Then she makes me remove and destroy one piece of no drop gear.  Frequently she questions my manhood and makes suggestive comments about my relationship to my pet.  <br />
<br />
And then there are the days she's in a bad mood.  <br />

In fact I've joined groups where the shammy just wouldn't give me time to heal someone. I actually had to hit them over the head to make them stop.<br />
<br />
I pet, heal and buff. I go battle cleric sometimes and nuke even less. I keep stun up to keep mobs from gating. Other than that I make sure my ass lives through the fight so we can get back to killing the next rare.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As a cleric I always pay close attention to the slower (shaman or chanter). Those slows pull as much aggro as casting CHeal on your tank when the mobs only at 90% health. The point is that slowers get aggro. They need to be at full health just like the Main Tank does before the pull. Everywhere I XP at now requires a slower! If the shaman does not have the mana to slow and the tank goes down before my heal can go off the other group members are screwed, because this cleric will throw up his shield and zone or gate, then come back to rez the group. <br />
  Those poor Shamans should be using cani all the time if they are not casting or buffing. If the shammy is doing its job i can jump off my Drogmor or get off my butt and improve my bash or other melee skills. Always asking that shammy for a haste, of course. <br />
   In LDoN I have had several groups where the shammy was the Main Healer and I was the back-up. I was busy slaying the undead. We found that with a cleric in kill mode got us through the Dungeon in record time. I was DOTing, casting undead nukes and tanking. Always keeping the Shamans life up so he can cani freely. <br />
  A Shammy with endless life is a happy one.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Most of the Shamans that I group with usually heal themselves and prefer it that way. Many of them have hotkeys set up that they are using Canni and not to heal. I have no problem healing the shaman though if they need it. My heals are more efficient then theirs plus if they are canni'ing they are in need of mana and Im usually not.<br />
<br />
In your situation, I agree that the shaman was abrupt in the way he asked for a heal. But, there could be a few reasons besides rudeness for it. In any group a shaman is one of the busiest classes, constant buffing, slowing, malo, ect. In a pick up group I rarely remember who is playing what class and there isnt time to look and see, "Oh Xperson, is the cleric". (I personally make hotkeys to target the MT, puller and chanter...so knowing the names isnt necessary after hotkeys are made). It's just a timesaver when you're busy to say, hey cleric. I wouldn't take offense unless this is a consistent problem.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">It's all a matter of mana in the early levels.  All caster's mana really belongs to the entire party.  If you have some extra, pop a heal on your local shammy.  However, in later levels when shammies get quiescence <sp?> they'll bust your b@lls for overwriting their quiescence with a celestial.  In this case, it definitely becomes a question of mana.  Pop a small heal on them for good measure and move on if you have the mana handy.  If not, don't worry, they should know what they're doing by this time.  If they don't, they'll find out soon enough.  Just make sure they have enough hp left to slow that last mob, then let 'em canni themselves down to worm food. :)<br />
