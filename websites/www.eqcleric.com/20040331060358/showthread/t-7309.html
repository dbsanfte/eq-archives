<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Been thinking about this post for a fair bit. <br />
<br />
IMHO, there it is difficult to come up with hard and fast rules for this one. We are unique as a class in that we are totally focused on our team mates and how to keep them alive. To do this over the long term requires us to be as mana efficient as possible. <br />
<br />
To determine which heal to use depends on so many factors. Some of the things that are running through my head are:<br />
<br />
1) Is the slower landing his/her slows effectively? After the slow lands you have more time to react.<br />
2) Is someone else drawing agro? You do not want to be the spot of trying to heal 2 tanks at once.<br />
3) Is there a back up healer? What arrangements have you made with this person?<br />
4) Is the MOB landing unique damage? <br />
5) Is there a chance of adds? <br />
6) What is your mana level? <br />
<br />
I try as a rule to let the MT run down to 35 -40% health before using Cheal. Normally I only use cheal on the tanks. I use a faster heal on the casters and others with lower hp. Cheal is of course a very effective spell at the appropriate time, but it ties the cleric up for those 10 seconds and 10 seconds is a very long time in a pitched battle. You can always duck of course to halt the cast if you have made the wrong call, but still very valuable time could be lost.<br />
<br />
Will be very interested in hearing other opinons on this one!</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Not really a level concern... more like a amount of HP concern.  Some tanks you may find will be majorly twinked out.  The point of CH is mana efficient healing.  So lets use some math here :)<br />
<br />
Complete Heal = 400 mana to heal all damage (up to 7500 but that's not going to come into play here)<br />
Superior Healing = 250 mana to heal 583<br />
<br />
Your CH would have to heal not quite twice what Superior Heal does to be efficient (more if you have mana preservation or improved healing).  933hp to be as efficient as Superior Healing w/o focus.  If you land a CH at 25% that means your tank has to have at least 1243 hp for CH to be as effective as SH.<br />
<br />
At 44 you can cast Celestial Healing (750 over time for 225 mana).  So your CHs will have to pack a bit more punch to be as effective. (1333hp per heal) which means your tank will need 1777hp if your heal lands at 25% (again not counting any focus).<br />
<br />
Just ask your tank how many HP he/she has.  I'm not really sure how many HP tanks at your level have, but since Temperance is 800hp by itself and Valor + Pinzarn is 500hp or so I would imagine it's not going to be too difficult to get around those numbers mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">In a single group, the heal depends on several factors.<br />
<br />
1) HP of the tank<br />
2) Rate of Damage being inflicted on said tank<br />
3) Rate of mana use/regen<br />
<br />
<br />
At my current level/gear/aa/FT stuffs, in a group I rarely run low mana.  But at YOUR level, it was an issue and I was often the bottleneck to grinding.  My mana being low meant the group came to a halt while I medded.  So I tried to use CH whenever possible.  It's flat out the most mana efficient.   I also tried to sit or be mounted as much as possible, don't forget yaulp if you have it.   Even with that, sometimes you just can't use CH and sometimes you are low mana anyway.  I'm not a math fiend, so I'm just gonna share my thought processes.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were some warriors I grouped with regularly that I could wait until I saw the beserker message to cast CH.  10 seconds later, CH lands with plenty of HP to spare.  Other warriors I had to cast at 50% HP to land in time.  Rangers (yes they can tank) I had to cast at 75% because it takes 10 seconds to land and by then the ranger was on the edge of death.<br />
<br />
There are other fights where the tank is taking on damage so fast that it's clear my CH is going to land late, and I have to duck to cast a quick heal.  Or maybe the mob isn't slowed yet so a quick heal until slow lands is necessary. Watch out for doing quick heals though.  Often you getting into a losing battle with the amount being healed not equalling the amount of damage inflicted - your recast is such that you can't cast fast enough and you are burning through your mana.  On many fights I will cast a heal over time spell as the pull is coming in.  If it lands before the mob is engages, I have zero agro from it and it will buy me time for the follow up CH to land.  My rule of thumb - on new tanks, or unfamiliar ones, or classes other than warriors, I heal early until I get a good feel for them.  <br />
<br />
But to answer your question, I use CH whenever I can without it taking too long and killing my tank.  There is a reason we have this spell, and there is a reason they still won't upgrade it.  It's the best one we have for the mana it uses.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I just hit level 39 and got this spell.  What I did to decide which to use is this:<br />
<br />
- take the number of hp you currently heal with Superior Healing (605 in my case) and divide by the mana cost (250).  This is the number of hp you heal per 1 mana with this spell.<br />
- multiply this number by the mana to cast CH (400).  This is the minimum number of hps you must heal for it to be as mana efficient as your Superior Healing (968 for me).  Remember that this does not account for any Mana Pres items you may have.<br />
<br />
Now.  This is in terms of pure mana efficiency.  If you are in a situation that requires you to hurry, then you might want to sacrifice mana efficiency for a faster heal.  That's your call.  Similarly, if you are having aggro issues, you might want to stick with the HoT line.  <br />
<br />
(Incidentally, at level 34 I calculated 2.25 hp/m for Celestial Health and 2.3 hp/m for Superior Healing.  This put Superior a teeny-tiny bit more mana efficient than the HoT.  I believe that this was based on given heal values and so did not include the extra 5% hp for being a cleric, or any level variations.  Just for reference.)</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I tend to cast CH around 50% with the tanks I know (one a mob is slowed).  The primary reason being in PoP there are some nasty procs on the mobs that can put a dent into a tank's health real quick.  Nine times out of ten (or even twenty!) I might be able to start heals at 30-40% and the tank not even get close.  However, there is always that one time where a few "lucky" procs land on your tank and he drops to nothing in 5 seconds... I'd rather waste a little mana by healing a tiny bit earlier than have a rez and rebuff every 30 minutes.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">As a general rule, always use cheal whenever possible. If the tank can survive for 10 seconds it's the most mana efficient way to heal. If it doesn't look like the tank will survive that long, then put a heal over time on the tank when a mob is pulled.<br />
<br />
Once you establish that you can do cheals on the tank, then experiment with what percent to cast it at. 40% is a good general rule, but I like to start at 50% - 60% and work my way down, depending on the zone, the quality of our slower and the tank's hitpoints. I never ask the tank how many hitpoints he has, because I can tell that the first couple heals I cast on him.<br />
<br />
The healing game changes when you reach your 60's. You get a whole new line of supernal spells that make it possible with a large mana pool never to cast cheal and still stay near full mana.<br />
<br />
My 65 cleric uses 3 mana mangement modes, with the goal of trying to stay at 80% mana:<br />
<br />
1. Full mana mode.  Group is uber. Elixir the tank on incoming and maybe toss out a supernal light if needed. Drop a nuke once in a while to show that I'm still awake.<br />
<br />
2. 60% mana mode. Toss an elixir on tank on incoming, complete heal when he's down to 35%-50%.<br />
<br />
3. Low mana mode or no c3. Complete heals only (if possible). If mob unslowed (or hard hitter), cast cheal at 50-70%. If mob is slowed, cast complete heals as late as possible, usually 30-35%.</td>

Starting around 40% Life, then adjusting as the group progresses.. IE, if your Cheals are hitting when he's still at 35%, start them at 30%, but always allow yourself more leeway if there is no secondary healer in case another person gets argo.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">All this math is icky.  Learning to cast CH is just an art, not a science.  Watch your tanks health.  Learn how much health he loses in 10 seconds against the mobs you're currently fighting.  Cast CH 10 seconds before he would get to the low end of your comfort zone.  Pay attention for spiky damage input, realize that different level mobs or different class mobs do damage differently, be watchful for adds, etc.  I've been casting CH since the summer of 2000, and I don't watch anything but the rate at which the tanks hps is dropping.  Most of my CH's, when I'm really playing, land on the tank around 5% health.<br />
<br />
Starting you CH at X% or calculating out tanks hps vs mana cost is silly.  If you have CH and you have a plate-class tank you should be using it.  Tanks will randomly tell me thier hp/ac as if I have some huge spreadsheet sitting beside me that has every variable in it accounted for so that I can cast the perfect CH.  It depends on the tanks hp/ac/defensive AA's, disciplines.  It depends on the mobs DPS.  It doesn't depend on the fact that the health bar just hit 35-40%.  In Plane of Fire, I start most CH's around 80-90% on solid tanks.  In Plane of Innovation, its closer to 30%.  If I'm back in Sebilis or KC for some reason, I start it around 15-20% even with 2-3 mobs on the tank.</td>

I must be an engineer, 'cause the math thing just seems sooo obviously the way to look at this. Not for nuthin Aelix, but goin by "feel" can get you into a lot of trouble real quick. Sure, experience will build, and you will get better at making the calls about which spells to cast when, but I ALWAYS ask what the tanks hitpoints are, otherwise, ... what, watch him get beat on until he is almost dead, so you know how much damage he can take? Fire off a small heal to see how much it can heal him? The math just takes away some of the initial fumbling around at the very begining of a group, alowing you to get to full efficincy/ effectivness as quickly as possible. ( wow, sounds like an accountant/ cleric is writing this)<br />
Generallly, i try and get my CH-es to hit for at least 1800 HP to make em worth more than 3 superior heals, to make the mana use and time spent med-in thing most efficient.<br />
I ain't Uber, by no means, so I am still fumblin my way through this great occupation of ours, like everyone else did when they started, I assume, but this board and the discussions here-in are a great source of information for me and everyone else. Thanks to all for a great site and great contributions. <br />
To all who are Uber, a small personal request, don't assume we lowlies automatically know what you are saying, or that the long strings of initials automatically make sense to us.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">When I hit 39, here is what I did:<br />
<br />
I hunt alot with my husband, an SK. When I got my cheal spell, I felt very uncomfortable with it. So, I spent some time in a hard hitting zone (like the LoY zones) with my hubby, and explained to him that even though I knew it wouldn't be mana efficient, time efficient etc to use it at that level, I really wanted to learn how to use it. So I practiced on him. <br />
<br />
Since I was so uncomfortable, the first few times I casted it, I started when he was at 60% health. When I was ok with that, I started at 50% health, and so on, until I could feel confident waiting until he was at 40% (a goal number given to me by another cleric that I asked).<br />
<br />
Even now in my low 60s, when we face a new zone and I'm unsure of the hits that our tanks will take, I use this practice. I find it especially useful when in PoP zones, as the mobs there hit so quickly and the damage they hand out can come in unpredictable spikes.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I waste mana with this practice, but not very often. I realize that there is math involved etc, but when my tank is going down the last thing on my mind is mana to HP ratio-my math isn't quite that fast. <br />
It is a good practice to ask the tanks you group with what their HP is, every time. Even if you group with the same tank every day, their HP can change from day to day, based on new equipment they've puchased, the buffs they got just then etc. I'm always asking, people are grateful for this because it shows them that you're paying attention to them. Any more, they just tell me after they get buffed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you. Back then, I didn't have such a vast library of knowledge to reference (this site, of course), so I winged it. :D</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Having played a cleric and druid all of my life now, let me add something here.  CH is a hard spell to use effectively.  Yes it is mana effiencent.  My suggestion is start using it as soon as you get it.  Learn how to judge the mobs and timing of the heal.  10 secs seems like forever when you start casting it and the tank is taking more damage then you figured.  Up front it will not be mana effiencent in a lot of cases.  But these are the learning years.  learn the timing, learn the mana management, constantly watch the mobs hitting ability.  Also watch what kind of tanks you have.  Rangers for the most part are made of paper when compared to pally and warriors and timing a CH on them will be different<br />
<br />
As for when should you have it memed?  Always.</td>

This site is great....helps me out alot, being a relative newcomer to the world of EQ (4 months rl play time). I am a Lvl 41 (almost 42) dwarf cleric on Erollisi Marr. <br />
<br />
I have Superior, Complete and Word of Health, plus the few buffs and resists at this lvl that help mem'd all the time when I am grouped. And from reading all the other posts, wish I could do the math. But I just use my best judgement on which heal to use, I do get the MT's hps. Another thing is CHeal at this level is a mana hog as far as I am concerned....if you watch your tanks and see what kind of damage is being done by/to them.....I find a Superior Heal is the best to use at this lvl (I heal for 615p right now), and I only use the Complete Heal in a bad pull situation (and at this lvl of groupage, you can get a few) and then use a grp heal between fights if your grp is cruising through a dungeon.  It takes mana management, careful eye, and always learning from each fight, because what worked the last time will not always work this time. <br />
<br />
Might have a been a bit off course....but this seems to work for me, at least for now, and I can see from the other posts that I will definitely change my style as I continue lvl. <br />
