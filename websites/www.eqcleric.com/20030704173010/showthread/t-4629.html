<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I was just wondering how many of you do this and if its a good idea. Since theres only eight spell slots they are all very precious and cant be wasted especially on a personal safety spell, but at the same time it might be a good idea to bind on the steps so to speak of the dungeon so i can gate out and maybe get back to the corpses faster  for rezzes should something go bad. At the same time id feel guilty about not staying till the end and trying my best to make the impossible possible. /grr <br />

 If it helps im a 22 cleric and as of now my spell slots look like this:<br />

forgot about the second question. <br />

i'm bound in pok just because i know i'll forget to rebind myself and end up poping outside of cc when i'm hunting in dsp.... and cause you can get anywhere from pok.<br />
<br />
secondlay i think that its a judgement call when to zone. if your getting pounded next to the zoneline and your group doesnt know what the tuant button is, then its ok to slip out for a few moments to ditch the mob. but if youre in full health and mana and your mt's geeting beaten while trying to get into range so the druid can evac, its best to stick around.<br />

<br />
Since I keep finding a use for it I keep it memmed all the time. I always keep the bottom 2 slots static with DB and Gate, which works well as a combination.<br />
<br />
I think it's more of a personal preference rather than a right or wrong way of doing it. Some people like having Gate up, others don't mind not having it memmed.<br />

1.  Complete Healing<br />

7.  Petrifying Earth<br />
8.  Divine Aura<br />

From my point of view, it's pointless to have Gate memmed, because I can hit Divine Aura, sit down and mem gate, and by the time DA has worn off, Gate is up and ready to cast.<br />
<br />
I won't gate unless I'm the last person standing in the group.<br />
<br />
That's easy for me to say, because I have spellcasting reinforcement mastery and my DA lasts for 27 seconds.  I can't remember for certain sure if you can mem gate under an 18 second DA - but I'm prepared to bet that you can!<br />
<br />
I never have gate memmed in an experience group - it seems discourteous and cowardly - but I always have it up while soloing or travelling.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">/eek  Is there any doubt? I always have it up in my last slot. Why? Because, I'm not a warrior, beastlord, Sk, Monk, etc etc. My skills are to heal. If that goes south, most likely theres not much I'll be able to do with my sword to change the situation so the next best thing would be to live and res.<br />
<br />
I usually bind myself at the edge of a zone after I zone in. This way, if the fighting goes bad and the group dies, I can gate to the edge of the zone, zone in and out real quick if needed to break aggro, and then I can quickly go back to the spot to res people. <br />
<br />
Now, in an experienced group, most likely the MT or if they die, the next tank or tanks in line, should be able to say "Get out of here and zone" or "Run" or something to indicate that they can't beat it but they'll hold if off as long as they can. (So valiant!) But, if they dont, and you start noticing your group drop like pants in a... (oh never mind), then I would gate out, cause like I said earlier, while I have a weapon on me, its rarely used. And I can't hit mobs hard enough with my spell book to make it count. :) BTW: This is the view from a 24 Cleric. Higherups may have differant views.</td>

I have been playing EQ for almost 4 years and have always have gate memmed, it has saved me many time and have reduced cr big time.  It will really depends on the person whatever you think is best, but I must admit gate has saved me alot of time while soloing, and grouping so if you think it is not worth memming think of it this way when you die again ask yourself this question, would gate have saved me, you would have no clue until you have tried it.  Well anyway i have always used it and will never leave home without it lol.<br />

What I mean by that is... when you are higher level, you're more likely to play with some of the same folks over and over again or atleast know the people who have gotten up that far are experienced with their gameplay. At lower levels, like me, the are many more people so its uncommon for me to see the same folks over and over agian (although it does happen) and I think a lot of the poeple still havn't mastered their characters so, yeah, there is a sense of using Gate as my safety net. Hell, I'm still trying to heal all the in's and out's of playing a cleric so... I think its a matter of, "If you feel comfortable with gate up all the time, leave it up." You shouldn't do something just because someone else doesn't. Like saying Cleric's can't melee. hehehehe</td>

As for the commnet about it being irresponsible.  That really irks me.  I can count on my hands the number of times the other members of the group have been "concerned" about my living or dying. (excluding Raids and Guild groups)  If it is irresponsible to devote 2 of your 8 slots to your own well being.  Then, IMO, you have a low sence of self preservation.   <br />
<br />
But, since reading this, I am going to try the DB, mem gate option, but I always forget about DB.  It is a spell that I never really got used to.  I don't like being unable to cast if I need to.  Yes I under stand that it is easy to click off, but I use primarily the keyboard and it is those precious moments of getting the mouse and accuratly clicking off the DB or DA.  I have a bad habbit of killing other buffs when I start clicking things off.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Tonsofrezzen, I'll agree with you that using two slots is reasonable, and that you use gate to my divine barrier. I can assure you I've had groups concerned for my well-being far more than the number of digits on my hand. They usually come running to help roughly the same time I'm reaching for DA.<br />
The reason I call it irresponsible is that I've seen casters gate out of fights when they've gotten concerned. I've heard many times of clerics gating out when things got hot, when the other people in the group thought it was totally manageable...no mention of the cleric being lom. I've actually seen this on my alts, and even once on my main. The fact that players are ready to bail on a whim like that is what irritates me. A good chunk of those people "go linkdead" soon after also.<br />
I rarely leave a fight until someone else tells me to, you will almost never hear me call for evac, I will only hesitantly call to run and won't until I see someone else take off. So from where I'm coming from, having gate up only suggests cowardice and betrayal. I realize this is an extreme view, but so were my feelings after seeing this happen. You can't keep people alive if you aren't there, and I've been through too many narrow scrapes to up and gate when four mobs enter camp.<br />

And I play primarily with the keyboard as well. Clicking off DA or a horse or whatever is a total nuisance, I agree.</td>

I have to agree with this somewhat. <br />
<br />
A few weeks ago, we were killing Offassa, and had a group for our ch chain.  We had a druid with us, for cure duty, and everything was going pretty much okay. When the mob got to @ 15 percent, the MT took some unlucky hits, and died. Then one of the clerics in chain died. Still no big deal, we had a new tank up and things were fine. All the sudden, though, the cleric group gets ported out...<br />
<br />
Seems the druid misclicked and hit their evac button for us...how kind!<br />
<br />
We've also had instances of wizards porting our WDS (Wizard Death Squad) out of raids, due to misclicking.<br />
<br />
We have had clerics accidentally gate from raids, due to memming gate in the wrong spell slot...really sucks when it happens mid-chain.<br />
<br />
While all of the above incidents were accidents, they could have all been avoided by simply not having Gate, or gate-type spells memmed on a raid. Yes, a raid is different from an exp group, but once in the habit, always in the habit.</td>
