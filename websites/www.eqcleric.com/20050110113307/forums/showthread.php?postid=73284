	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This is something I'd written abit ago...it's not completely done in terms of stories, since it was supposed to be several parts, but I wanted to get an entry again.  Whether it wins or not, if I get enough interest than I will post/finish the last parts of it.  It's rather long as it is anyways. P<br />
<br />
Also, the main character IS a cleric, unfortunately you don't discover that till later but since it's LONG, just kinda take that into account... Heh.<br />

<br />
	A shadow darted quickly amongst the ill-illuminated streets of the dark city.  A cloaked figure hurried to the Temple of the Dead; the footsteps quick and light as they made haste.  Turning to face the glowing runes that lit the way, the dark blue face of the woman shone as she focused an ear to listen for sounds in the night.  She heard silence.  Her lips pursed; she thought inwardly that this was a night to be remembered.  A quiet night in Neriak, she mused.  Did they prophesy this as well?<br />
	Remembering her purpose, she continued along; passing the ghouls who guarded the gate and treading up the steps to the inner sanctum of the temple.  She had much to say to those in control.<br />
<br />
		“You must be joking!  To make public of this news would throw all of our people into a frenzy; as well as every other living thing on Norrath.  Surely you cannot mean to trumpet this...foreboding vision to anyone who would listen?”<br />
	The man who had spoken glimpsed around the room; the light from the sun shone down on his wintry white hair and delicately etched features.  Any other time, the musings of nature would reflect upon his beauty, but in his despair, the light only made him look more like a shadow then a noble high elf.<br />
	He was facing a small group of highly esteemed brethren, 6 in number including himself, and unlike himself he had raised his voice more then necessary.  But now was not the time for subtlety.  He thought them all mad, and knew if he did not stop them, he would go mad as well.  He ranted for the sake of his sanity.<br />
	The elves around him did not look away; despite his rank in the Felwithe guard they were fairly sure that this man, one General Jyleel, was mistaken on this subject.  They had to make him see.<br />
	Jyleel twisted the cord on his tunic and sat down heavily on the closest chair near him.  It was a beautiful day, he thought.  I had the day off!  It was true.  Instead of his usual brilliant plate mail and sparkling sword, Jyleel wore the fashionable soft tunic, leggings and slippers of the leisured man.  It was not his time for duty, and he should have been enjoying himself.  But this was as far from rest and relaxation as one could get.<br />
	“Sir General, you must understand.” A raven haired high elf stepped forward, holding his hands in a submissive gesture as he tried to plead with Jyleel.  “There are a scant few of us who know anything as it is.  Only the best and brightest know anything, but with only us few we are no closer to our goal, and the time will soon be upon us.  Already it is said to begin.  We’ve no more time to waste.  Allowing more people to be aware of this knowledge would increase our chances considerably.”<br />
	Jyleel sighed.  He had never thought less of Tarkar then he did right now.  They are mad!  He screamed in his head.  They will bring their madness to the world, and it is five against one!<br />
	“Tarkar, you have not had the experience I have had with frenzied mobs.  If you wish to go forth with this, that is what you will get.  A mob in Felwithe, Kaladim, Ak’anon...go across the ocean and you’ll find Freeport and Qeynos to join the list.  Mass hysteria would not do our cause any good.  In fact, it will very well make it more difficult to determine who we truly need in this endeavor.  No, there is another way.  There must be.”<br />
	The other elves in the room took a seat.  Their scheduled meeting had not started well and they would need calm thoughts to think of a real solution.<br />
	“How many know of the prophecy?” asked the high elf in the corner.  Wearing the pristine blue robes of the clergy, he represented the priests in this matter, and was strong willed in seeing it through.<br />
	Tarkar paused a moment and thought.<br />
	“Not many,” he said at last.  “A few from each city.  Guildleaders here and there; and of course, most of the royalty.  Oh and oddly, a few not so distinguished characters.”   <br />
	“We should keep it that way,” Jyleel said without passion.  “Until we know where this threat comes from, we cannot panic the masses, nor can we let on that we are aware of the danger that looms over us.  It must be kept hidden.  We will find the chosen another way.  That is my decree.”<br />
	“But Sir..” Niola interjected.<br />
	“No more.”  Jyleel held up a hand.  “Do not make me pull rank anymore so than I have done already, Niola.”<br />
	The elves in the room were silent.  A great shuffling of feet was heard, and Jyleel more so than anyone felt the uncomfortable quiet.<br />
	He felt the need to break it.<br />
	“Now then gentlemen...and ladies...onto another matter...”<br />
<br />
	The cloaked woman continued through dark corridors, coming at last to a dimly lit room, where a lone dark elf male was impatiently scribbling in a spell book.  His lips moved, creating inaudible sounds as he sketched, then sighed as he erased glowing runes on a page.  Like all dark elves, he was handsome in the way that is often foreboding.  His delicately etched face was drawn back in deep concentration, and despite having heard her enter, he gave no acknowledgement.	<br />
She drew closer, drawing back her hood as she approached him.  When she was in sufficient distance, she spoke.<br />
	“The Queen has given birth, Elunar.  She asks for you.  The babe is female, and she has...that is to say, she is...unusual.”  The dark elven woman said, keeping her head bowed respectively to the guild master of this prestigious place.<br />
	The guildmaster gave her no heed, continuing to sketch, while muttering irritably to himself.<br />
	The woman moved closer to him; aligning her lips to his ear so others would not overhear.<br />
	“My Lord Elunar.  The child...she has a birth mark like...”<br />
	Elunar looked up at her in surprise.  “What mark?!”<br />
	The woman’s eyes widen and she instinctively took a step back.<br />
	Elunar D’Lunth grabbed her arm and pulled her closer.  In a rasping voice, he repeated the words.<br />
	“What mark does she have, Tyriel?”<br />
	Tyriel stammered as she tried to recall the exact marking.  Her body was rigid with fear; she knew this man would kill her if she did not explain quickly.<br />
	“It looks like...like...well like an elongated “m” in the common tongue.”<br />
	Elunar smiled grimly to himself and released the woman.  His eyes shone with a fierce light, and he flexed his fingers deftly.  He nodded at her shortly before returning to his work, silently dismissing her.<br />
	Tyriel sighed a breath of relief.  She had given him the news, that was all that was required.  She turned on her heel and hadn’t taken one step before she heard his voice again.<br />
	“Oh Tyriel...do bring the child to me.  I’d like to see her for myself.  I believe this one shall get special training from me.”<br />
	Tyriel stopped and turned around.<br />
	“My Lord, I believe Queen Alexandria wanted to raise her as one of her own.  As a priest of Innoruuk.”<br />
	Elunar glared menacingly at her.  “Are you arguing with me, Tyriel?”<br />
	Her eyes once again lit up with the unmistakable visage of dread.  “No sir, I do not argue.  She will be brought here at once.”<br />
	Elunar’s lips curled into a feral grin as Tyriel ran from the temple.  The time has come, he thought.  The prophesy has come to pass, and when it is fully realized, it will be too late.  Tonight, the plans begin.<br />
<br />
	Jyleel hurried from his private quarters.  A summons in the middle of the night surely could not be good.  He wondered if he would ever get a good night’s rest again.  Why?  He wondered, does the fate of the world rest on my shoulders?<br />
	He wished that he could say it had been sometime that he had been awake at this hour, but that wasn’t at all true.  The shadows that played off of the marble walls in the hallway had become rather familiar to him.  That thought alone made him all the more disgruntled.<br />
	He sighed and rounded a corner, nearly knocking over a plated half elf who was being guided by a new Felwithe recruit.  His profession was clearly marked by the lute held tightly in one hand.<br />
	“Ah Jyleel!  I was wondering if we would have to rouse you from your slumber.  This bard has some important news, I hear.”  The high elf smiled mischievously at Jyleel, taking too much pleasure in the fact his mentor was now remembering how it felt to be a trainee, a practice he himself had had the thrill of experiencing just recently.<br />
	“Slumber?”  Jyleel snorted.  “That is a leisure I haven’t had for quite awhile now.  What am I being summoned for?”<br />
	The high elf frowned.  “They wouldn’t tell me.  They instructed me to bring you and Hanico to the sitting rooms, without explanation.  The rest of the guildleaders are already there.”  And the elf pointed beyond Jyleel, where a door was opened to reveal a luxuriously furnished room.<br />
	Jyleel nodded and turned towards the room.  The room was obviously made to receive such visitors, as it was richly furnished and well-lit.  The marble walls were polished and gleamed with the natural and unnatural light that blended to echo off of the equally beautiful marble furniture that adorned the room.  <br />
	He moved towards a high velvet backed seat and sat down, waiting while the bard was shown where he was to sit.<br />
	The trainee deposited the bard in a chair and exited discreetly.  Once all were seated, Jyleel spoke.<br />
	“What is so important it could not wait for the sun to crest the horizon?”  Jyleel asked, quite crankily.<br />
	Tarkar Blazetoss stood up and addressed them all.  “There was a ruckus this morning, just outside of our gates.  This bard,” he said, pointing to the half elf, “was shouting distractedly that he needed to speak to those in charge at once.  That it was a matter concerning the prophesy.”<br />
	Jyleel looked at the half elf; his eyes narrowed suspiciously.  “What does he know of the prophesy?”<br />
	Tarkar continued.  “We have not discerned that, Sir General.  The guards, thinking him mad, thought to throw him into the dungeon until he had settled down, but our dear Niola heard him sputtering and came to claim him.  It was quite good timing, if I do say so myself.”<br />
	Niola nodded.  “Sometimes it pays to be up late researching.”<br />
	“Well now,” Jyleel addressed the bard.  “Let’s hear what you have to say.”<br />
	The half elf gulped nervously.  He wasn’t sure why he had come here, or why he had sought these few respected people, just that he knew they would understand what he meant.  How he knew that, he wasn’t sure.<br />
	“Well?” Tarkar said.<br />
	The bard stood up.  “Well sirs...and madams” he said, taking notice of Niola, “I had...a vision...I think.  Something about a prophesy, and the ending of the world.  It could just be fake; I had a lot to drink that night, but for some reason I felt I should come here to tell you.  Does that make sense?”<br />
	Kinool, the enchanter guildmaster, thought a moment and then nodded.  “It seems you were divinely touched, if the story proves to be true.  But enough of this babble.  Suppose you tell us what it is you saw?”<br />
	Hanico cleared his throat.  “It was mostly about some being.  I’m not sure what kind or what it was.  Just that he would be unstoppable, and the only one able to kill him would be a practitioner of arcana, one trained in the principles of wielding surrounding magic.”<br />
	The guild leaders around the table were stunned for a brief moment.  His vague rantings were true.  Without description, that was the basic gist of the vision many guild leaders of arcana had received, but a mere bard had glimpsed it as well?<br />
	“There’s more,” Hanico said, looking at those around the room.  “The wielder, our savior, well...she’s a dark elf.”<br />
	The leaders around the table gasped.  Not only had he seen the tale, but he had looked upon more than they had known!<br />
	Jyleel stood up and moved quickly to the bard’s side.<br />
	“You’re positive it was a dark elf?  And I mean, it was clear?  You saw it?  Jyleel spoke haltingly, a note of desperation in his voice.<br />
	“You mean it’s true?”  Hanico asked, stunned.  “I thought I had just drank too much, but I mean it’s all true?  The end of the world really is coming?”<br />
	Jyleel sighed and sat down heavily in his chair.<br />
	The other elves converged on Hanico, all talking at once.<br />
	“Did you see how we could find this elf?”  “What was her name?”  “What was it like, the being?”  “When will we find her?”<br />
	The bard scrambled back away from the high elves, wondering to himself if all beings of this race were as high strung as these ones appeared to be.<br />
	“Hush now,” Jyleel said loudly.<br />
	The other elves glanced warily at Hanico, but returned to their seats.<br />
	When they were seated, and all was quiet, Jyleel spoke.  “Yes, it is true.  But it will not happen for two decades yet.  However, it is imperative that we find this dark elf you saw in your vision.  She is the key to defeating this foe that will present itself many years to come.  She will need special training in order to be fully prepared.  Do you understand?  I need to know if she had a name, or if she can be found.”<br />
	The bard sat in deep thought for a moment, pouring through the remnants of his dream to find a hint, or a name.<br />
	“I think,” he started.  “I think she is just a child now.  No, a babe.  It seemed in my vision she would be very young when this conflict started, elven standards anyways.  She had no name.”<br />
	Kinool spoke again.  “You cannot remember anything else?”<br />
	Hanico’s lips pursed as he began the thought process again.  His face lit up as if he had found something that was lost.<br />
	“She has a birth mark,” he exclaimed triumphantly.  “It looks like three long pillars...I think.  I am not sure, but that is all I can remember.”<br />
	The elves sat in silence, each one in their own thoughts.<br />
	She is a disciple of Neriak, Jyleel thought.  A special elf, one trained as an arcane user instead of divine.  But gathering her to us...will be difficult.  And can we truly trust a dark elf?<br />
<br />
	Tyriel had in this time fought with Queen Alexandria.  As Queen she had wanted her babe to be raised as a priestess of Innoruuk, but when Tyriel told Alexandria of Elunar’s special attention to the child, the Queen relented.<br />
	“Neriak is very strong with many priestesses, but if Elunar finds an exception to this child, it may be to the betterment of us all that she goes to him for her training.  She will be well looked for, or I will have his hide as a doormat.”  The Queen had said.<br />
	Now, Tyriel raced along the streets of Neriak again.  She had known this route well, but tonight she had never felt more trepid as she made her way along the familiar path.  As she passed near a window outside of the necromancer temple, she heard two voices.  One, clearly was Elunar; the other was unknown to her, but he spoke with a hint of importance.<br />
	“She brings the babe tonight,” Elunar said quietly.  “Then we will have the very last key, and complete control over the only thing that can stop us.” <br />
	Tyriel wondered idly if Elunar and the unknown man were aware of the mysterious visions surrounding the babe.  It was silly to think that she, merely a messenger and handmaiden had glimpsed something important her superiors had not.  But still…dark elves were deceptive in nature.  If they were aware of it, she would probably never know.<br />
	“You are certain you know what you are doing, Elunar?”  The other voice said.  “To have this...child, so close to what she is destined to destroy cannot be good for us.  You think it not best to send her away?”<br />
	Elunar laughed.  “You really think I will keep her here, Ulraz?”<br />
	Tyriel gasped.  So they did know!  And what’s more, they were the cause of the frightful vision she had received.  But that name…Ulraz…that was the Shadowknight guildmaster!  She pursed her lips and listened again in silence.<br />
Elunar continued.  “You are a fool, Ulraz.  She will not survive here long.  Merely a fortnight from now she will meet with an unpleasant accident.  Strange things can happen in the temple of the undead...who’s to say she does not meet her end, an end brought about without our help?”<br />
	Tyriel’s eyes opened wide at Elunar’s admission.  She, like every other dark elf, had been bred into hatred and evil; into darkness and disdain; into the void and the abyss.  But for some reason, the knowledge that these brethren of hers meant nothing but harm to this newborn brought about a new emotion in Tyriel.  It was almost love.<br />
	She glanced down at the baby, and looked deep into her silver eyes.  “Perhaps I am a fool,” she whispered to the little one.  “But I hate Elunar and all he stands for.  And you child, a server of hate nonetheless, I will not see your life extinguished by a man of his...temperament.”<br />
	The baby looked back at her with seemingly intelligent eyes.  Tyriel regarded the babe for a moment then spoke again.<br />
	“Now listen closely, little Kandra.  I know you can understand what I am saying, so know this.  Forget you are a dark elf.  Forget this place, and forget what you are.  For I have seen what you are destined for.  Innoruuk help me, I do not know why I have seen it but I have glimpsed it.  You will not remain in this place for long; we leave tonight.  And the place I have in mind, you will be able to live a long time, in peace.  And perhaps, you will find happiness as well.”<br />
	And with that, Tyriel flipped her cloak over her eyes again and tucked the babe beneath the cloth of her robe.  Quickly and quietly, she made her way past all the guards, and out into the Nektulos forest.  Her plans for the babe did not include death and servitude.<br />
<br />
<br />
                Truly, there is nothing more rewarding then laying here with the sun shining down on me, thought Jyleel, as his eyes closed in comfort.<br />
	It had been 20 years since they had been touched by a gift of knowledge.  That gift, a glimpse into the future, had stayed the General’s path, and most of his allies.  Throughout the decades they had searched for the Elf of the Night who would lead a party and save them from the monster that was due to be unleashed in Norrath’s future.  The time was now upon them, and they were no closer to their goal.  Many sleepless nights had followed the General, and these moments when all was quiet and the events soon to come did not weigh heavily on his mind were few and far between.  He cherished them more than gold.  And if truth be told, sometimes even over his beloved Mother Tunare.<br />
	At the moment, he was draped over a beautiful velvet backed chair pushed beneath a window in his office.  Documents, maps, compasses, and all sorts of devices littered his desk, and any other area that was sturdy enough to support such things.  It seemed to him they had searched every part of the world, and they had come up empty handed continuously.<br />
	What if we do not find her?  He thought, his lips pursed in despair.  Mother Tunare, never have I wavered in faith as I have been your devout servant.  If you can hear this plea, help us to find the one we seek.  Your children depend upon you.<br />
	Tunare heard his plea.  She, like all other divine beings, had been warned they were not to directly interfere with the mortal’s lives.  The matter of an ancient destructive force being brought to life had been made known to her, and the plight of her beloved elves was at sake.  She would not sit idly by.<br />
	She muttered an incantation, and instantaneously, the alarm wards around Jyleel’s chamber were dispelled.  She watched in satisfaction as a dark figure moved about beyond the ivory walls.  Now for one last thing...<br />
<br />
	The dark elf glanced up at the harsh sun.  She squinted her silver eyes at it, and brushed a long strand of hair out of her face.  The brightness was staggering.  Despite having been raised above ground unlike most dark elves, the sun still shown down on her with full ferocity.  It burned her eyes, and made them water, but she knew no one would expect someone to strike at this hour.  She withstood the heat and light for her sake.  She needed the element of surprise.<br />
	She moved unsteadily toward an oval window mounted high upon the wall of what she knew to be Jyleel’s resting place.  How anyone can move in this silly chainmail is beyond me, she thought painfully, once again adjusting the blackened chainmail armor she had adorned for this task.  She sheathed her dagger, then reached up and swung herself up on the window sill.  She landed silently, and thought smugly that it was all going according to plan.<br />
	Looking through the window, she saw the General laying on his back on an ornately decorated sofa.  A momentary flash of regret coursed through her as she thought of what she must do, but she dissipated it quickly.  It must be done, and I am here.  So it shall be.<br />
	She pushed the window open, and landed lightly and without sound to her feet inside of the room.  Creeping towards the sofa, she unsheathed her dagger again, and made ready to strike.  As she came upon Jyleel, she heard whispered arcane words.  She had little time to decipher their meaning, but knew it was planar in nature.  Jyleel’s eyes opened in response and in her surprise, she paused, giving him enough time to take up his sword.<br />
	She grimaced, knowing she had erred and hoping she would still be able to complete her task before his reinforcements arrived.  Cursing in the teir’dal tongue, she lunged forward, putting full force on the dagger she swung at him.<br />
	Jyleel was alarmed at her speed, and it was that thought that cost him the pain he endured.  He brought up his sword and dodged deftly to the left, in time for the dagger to miss it’s intended mark, but not fast enough to avoid it completely.  The blade sunk deep into his arm, and he howled in pain as he saw it pushed in to it’s hilt.<br />
	The dark elf abandoned that blade and ducked the crash of his sword as he brought it around.  The blade in his arm made his targeting slightly off, and he missed a second time.  His opponent reached underneath her arm and pulled out another blade, as fine as the first she had wielded.  She came at him with more caution, but he saw the fire burning in her eyes, and he wondered if she would get the better of him, unarmored and undefended as he was.<br />
	Jyleel took a defensive stance, dodging blow after blow.  He swung once again, and the sword connected with her arm, but did little other than cause her slight irritation.  She leapt at him, and brought her foot up, kicking against his sword.  It skittered across the floor and out of his reach, and she raised her dirk for the final strike.<br />
	Before she could move, blue lights twinkled around her, settling upon every inch of her body.  She ignored them and began to spring forward.  Only then did she realize what had happened.  A holding spell had been cast upon her, and now she would not be able to finish what lay before her.  Unable to express her disgust, even unable to move,  she let her eyes do the work, gleaming hatred at her aggressors.<br />
	Jyleel was breathing heavily after having had to defend his life suddenly.  He motioned to the guard to restrain the elf as he sat down warily onto his sofa.  Yeolarn sat down beside him, and immediately began mending the wound he had received.  The holding spell wore off, and the elf growled in anger.<br />
	“Leave me be!  The General is alive, despite my effort.  You elves still have your pathetic leader in arms.” she spit out at them, the fire in her eyes raging.<br />
	Jyleel stood up and crossed over to her.  “Why the attempt on my life, dark elf?  You appear to be a rogue of the Ebon Hand yet you are unwieldy in your attacks, clumsy even.  Perhaps this is your first mission, yes?  And suppose you tell us your name?  My clerics can cast a truth spell on you if you feel no need to answer.”<br />
	She looked up at them and made no move to respond.  She glanced back at the clerics and thought better of it.  Blowing that same pesky strand of hair out of her face, she spoke.<br />
	“What do you think I was doing here, you weakling?  Attempting to rid Felwithe of it’s great General and thereby weakening it when the forces of Neriak come forth to challenge you.  I would have succeeded if the cavalry hadn’t arrived. You can take pleasure in the fact you’ve only delayed me.  I’ll try again.”<br />
	Jyleel chuckled at her admission.<br />
                “How do you suppose to try, Cousin Elf, when you are to be bound and shackled in the jailhouse?  If, dear rogue, you can escape the magical bonds and enchantments on your cell, then will I truly believe Neriak will ever overtake this great city.”<br />
	Jyleel nodded his head at the two silver plated guards who held the ebony elf in their grasp.  “Take her to her jail cell; make sure she’s comfortable.  Oh and one more thing, elf.  What may we have the pleasure of calling you?”<br />
	The two militia men had by then started to lead her away, but she turned to face Jyleel again.  She blew her hair back away from her face and steeled her eyes at him.<br />
	“The name is Kandra.  You can remember that the next time we meet.  You’ll need to know who to address when begging for your life.”<br />
	And with that, she turned and let the guards led her out.<br />
	Jyleel watched with mild amusement.  He wondered if they should have cast the truth spell anyways.  The explanation she had given had seemed dull, lifeless.  In short, it hadn’t seemed honest.  And when she spoke of Neriak, she did so with contempt in her voice.  It was true the female had nearly ended his life, despite the fact she seemed just out of the training guild.  And what’s more, it was apparent to him she had put forth much effort to appear as venomous as she had shown herself to be, but he reckoned that, that too, was just a facade.<br />
	There was a slight muffled sound from just outside his chambers, and he rushed through the entrance-way to see Kandra struggling against her captors.  An entire entourage ensured she would not be successful, but she nevertheless tried.  As she fought them off, her chainmail shifted, revealing the upper part of her arm.  It glistened in such a way that Jyleel had no choice but to take note.  Craning his head he looked carefully at what was causing it.  A small, visible tattoo had been placed upon her. In a silvery sheen it had been formulated into the common letter ‘m’.<br />
	Jyleel paused as he scanned the artistry, then urged his guards to press forth and get her locked away quickly.  He returned to his chambers, now fully awake.<br />
	“Oh, Tarkar.  By the way...” he said as he thrust his head back outside the door.<br />
	“Yes, my Lord?”  The wizard guild master said in response.<br />
	Jyleel looked around the outside of the walls.  “Tell me, how it was she managed to get past all the magical alarm wards placed here outside of my quarters?  Surely a rogue of her nature could not dispel them?”<br />
	Yeolarn heard the question and came back to address the elves.<br />
	“General, I believe I can answer that question.  The wards...they were divinely dispelled.  The touch of our Mother Tunare is everywhere over this.  She made the event happen.”<br />
	The two elves were astonished by this news.  To believe that their faithful Mother had wanted to cause harm to one of her children seemed too ludicrous to give heed to.  Unless...<br />
	Unless we were supposed to find her and capture her.  The wards would surely have destroyed her.  And it was Tunare who woke me up so assuredly from my nap, to be sure the elf did not slay me outright.  But why so much fuss over this silly elf who is not what she wishes to be seen as?  Why...<br />
	And then something struck him.  His eyes opened wide in excitement and he ran back into his office, calling Yeolarn and Tarkar to follow him.<br />
	<br />
	Elunar wiped his blade clean with the hem of his robe.  The blood, thick and caked onto the adamantine metal, drew streaks of wetness against the robe as he cleaned it off.  He surveyed the mess around him.  His plan was taking shape tonight and much to his pleasure, slaughtering those who resided in the Temple of the Dead was part of the process.<br />
	Ulraz came up a staircase set behind him; his sword was dripping with blood and his brow showed a thin line of sweat.  He had, as well, been helping to carry out the ministrations for their plot tonight.<br />
	Elunar nodded once at the guild master, then turned towards an ebony bowl, carved with intricate silvery runes.  Into this he poured a minute amount of blood from every victim slain by their hands.  When the deed was done, he motioned Ulraz to follow him as they descended down the staircase to the deepest reaches of the temple.  Once there, Elunar hurried to a corner and chanted imperfect spell mutterings, causing the wall to glow with an ethereal light.  As the last syllable of the incantation died on his lips, the walls shimmered and faded, revealing a second set of stairs that further dipped into the darkness.<br />
	The two of them traveled down the walkway, and at least arrived in the very belly of the entire city.  Here Elunar had erected a shrine of sorts, with one difference.  It was dedicated to a monstrosity, and not a God.  There were sparse adornments; in the very middle of the room was a towering statue, covered with a cloth of fine black silk.  To one end was a gleaming blue rune, enchanted to cast dim light over everything it extended to.  And finally, at the very entrance of the room was a fine alter, carved out of pure volcanic ash, it was as black and dark as the obsidian bowl he carried.<br />
	Ulraz watched as Elunar prepared everything.  Elunar did it all with a bounce in his step, and he wondered if the necromancer had not truly gone mad in his many years of anticipation.<br />
	“Tell me, my friend,” Ulraz said quietly.  “What ever became of the child?”<br />
	Elunar did not stop, but continued to make ready the summoning circle for the ceremony.  “She is dead,” he said without passion, and unveiled a giant adamantine golem, the new body for their lord.  “Everytime I scry for her,” he continued, while painting runes on the golem’s body with the blood from the bowl, “I come up with nothing.  There is no sense, just darkness.  If I thought she were capable, I’d say she was blocking me.  But that cannot be right.  So I know she is dead.”  As he said the last words, he dumped the rest of the blood onto the floor before the golems feet and placed the bowl upon the newly fashioned alter.  Slicing into his own hand, he added a drop of his blood to the basin.  The rim began to flicker eerily and he smiled, satisfied all was as should be.<br />
	“Now, Ulraz.  Let us begin shall we?”<br />
	Ulraz moved closer to the necromancer, ready to join him in the summoning ritual.  “This will make the golem sentient yes?” he asked as he came up behind him.<br />
	Elunar chuckled.  “Ahh you are such a simpleton!  The golem will not merely be sentient; it will be the embodiment of the greatest of beings!  A new body for an old Lord, yes?  You must watch, and help me Ulraz, for tonight you will see a God be reborn!”<br />
	Elunar began to chant in low tones, smearing the blood at the golem’s feet into a wide arching circle.  With every pass of his hand, the floor radiated a strange heat, a heat that grew oddly colder and brighter with each sweep of his hand.  The sound of his voice expanded, increasing in pitch, clarity, and volume.  His chanting abruptly ceased and he moved backwards, watching as the pale red light evaporated from the blood and drew lazy circles around the metal form of the body.  <br />
	Without missing a beat, Elunar turned on Ulraz and sank an adorned obsidian blade deep into his belly.  The blood gushed over his hand as it spilled onto the floor, and Ulraz, the life rushing out of him, fell to his knees.  A look of pure shock was permanently fixed upon his face.<br />
	Elunar smiled and whispered quietly to himself, “And as I have turned traitor on my brethren, so must you spill the blood of your closest kin, so I may breath the air of immortality again.”<br />
	The blood expelled from Ulraz took on a life of it’s own and began to move as one body.  It crept closer to the metal skeleton; seemingly dancing a disconcerting waltz as it moved toward it’s target.  As it reached the foot of the golem, the blood began to form a tight enclosure, sheathing the metal casing in a hard coating of dried blood. <br />
	Elunar’s voice rose again; the last of the incantations forcibly pouring through his lips.  The red circles coalesced and converged on the metal frame, pouring into the metal shell and giving it life.  The ground rumbled, and the golem moved slightly.<br />
	The necromancer’s mind snapped, so great was his pleasure in seeing his creation moved.  As the golem took his first steps, he began to scream excitedly, “Breathe the fresh air of your new life, my Lord!  Breathe and come forward, and wreck havoc upon all of the world.  You are reborn, and this time, no one shall stop you, I will see to that, my Lord Kerafyrm.”<br />
<br />
	Jyleel was in an odd mood of sorts.  Nearly grinning, almost laughing, he ran back to his study and became to rip papers and parchment off of every shelf in the room, hurriedly searching for something he knew to be there.<br />
	Yeolarn and Tarkar followed behind him; their eyebrows raised in a curious manner as they watched their great General in his madness.<br />
	“Tell me, you two…” he said, now pulling and riffling through pages of written documents on his desk, “what it was that bard had said would be able to distinguish the elf from all others of her kind?”<br />
	The two elves exchanged glances.  “That she would be an arcane user, my lord?”<br />
	Jyleel shook his head, exclaiming a triumphant cry as he finally found what he was looking for.<br />
	“No, not that…remember…the birth mark the elf was supposed to have?”  Jyleel brought up a magnifying glass and passed it over the paper.  “This…is a drawing made by that bard Hanico.  He detailed what he had seen in his vision.  She was supposed to have a birthmark shaped like three pillars.”<br />
	He motioned the elves around to his side of the desk and handed them the looking glass.  “Does that mark look familiar?”<br />
	Yeolarn and Tarkar looked at the parchment in turn, realization dawning on their faces.<br />
	“That elf…” Yeolarn began.<br />
	“She is…” Tarkar continued.<br />
	“Yes!  Now you see!”  Jyleel jumped in excitement.  “What if the birthmark wasn’t three pillars, but an M?  That elf had a silver M tattooed on her arm, only it wasn’t a tattoo.  She is the one we have been searching for!”<br />
	And with that, he ran from the room; his comrades following him, intent upon claiming the savior that had been right under their nose.</font></p>
