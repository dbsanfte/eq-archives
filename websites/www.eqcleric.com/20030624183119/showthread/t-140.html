<br />
  Temple of Solusek Ro:<br />
<br />
<br />
     Seeker is male after 9am right? And female after 9pm? And hes ont he left of the throne when entering?<br />
<br />
     Next is I read that the other things in Ro dont aggro him after his AE, so my question is; Do they still aggro him?<br />
<br />
     I read I can gate back and he will still coem to zone. Is this true? Cause I dont wanna screw it up by doing that and eh dosent still travelt o zone.<br />
<br />
      One last question. The keepers in the front? If he does his AE will they attack him? If so do I just bring a chanter to mez them while we kill him?<br />
<br />
      Okay one more consider this a P.S. hehe What level si plasmatic priest and his HP if anyone knows since I cant find anything on him.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Best way ive found to pull the priest is this:<br />
<br />
hand him the ring (or orb? i cant remember) and just start high tailing to the zone where your group is.  When i did it, i had a monk pull with me, to make sure nothing went screwy.  DO NOT GATE. it will take you too long, and its really easy to just run, and jump of the balcony.<br />
<br />
I think you can just consider the priest, and you'll know its him because hes the highest lvl keeper in there.  Its been a long time since i did this part, so Im a lil rusty on the details.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I am up to the RF fight and so far nothing has been no-rent. I know the shards in SF and the pearl from RF is also not no-rent, nor is the heart of RF you take back to TD, so I am guessing none of the epic involves no-rent items.<br />
<br />
In Temple, The seeker is indeed male, blue to level 60, and spawns to the left of the throne. A female seeker is the PH during the other half day. To pull him, hand in and sprint to the zone (jump off balcony...he runs around). I was told by many to have stuns loaded for his CH...but, he's immune to stuns, so don't bother.<br />
<br />
He will agro the others in the area if he casts his AE Tremor spell. Just pull him into the zone tunnel to LS and you should have little problem. I did the fight with me (60 Cleric), 54 Warr, 60 ranger, 60 Enchanter, and 60 monk. It was WAYYY overkill. Dropped in 20 seconds tops.<br />
<br />
As for level for the epic effect, I have known noone below 56 getting epic since RF was such a mess. But other items with an effect which is a spell normally received by that class at a given level can not use effect until that level is attained. So my educated guess would be Level 56 to use epic effect.<br />
<br />
Now, for my epic question. Zordak spawn in SolB. I understand his spawn table is 24 hours from last turn-in. Does this mean I have to sit there a full RL day?!? I don't have that kind of time to dedicate to a camp sadly. When server is taken down, how long does it take for him to pop? We will have MANY resets here soon with PoP coming out, maybe I can catch him then.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">OKay,  for Chardok, the Overking is a Nasty nasty fight,  if you aggro the queen,  you might as well call a necro to start summoning bodies.  I would say 4 groups of 55+ can get down there,  and kill the Overking with little trouble,  make sure you get a couple of good monks to break the kings guards....when i did it,  we pulled him into the Hallway,  every other time I went after him...tried for that damned note over 15 times hehe kept losing randoms or just wasnt my night....we charged him in his room,  we pulled as many guards out as we could,  then just took the rest as we charged.....as far as Ixiblat Fer goes,  2 good groups of 58+ can take him out,  otherwise I would treat him like a Naggy or Vox Raid,  get several groups of 50+ together...yes the big thing on him is SLOW,  get that slow landed so you can save the tank and your mana.   SolB Ragefire is a 24 hour spawn timer, and  I dont know if you aggro the giants or not...I caught him up before the whole revamp patch for our epic making it a ton easier...so I had the giants cleared and just walked up and turned in my pearl and presto....Shards took me 3 days to get about 5 hours a day  not bad at all.<br />
<br />
For anyone trying the Plasmatic Priest....Divine Aura is your friend....do the turn in,  hit the DA button, and tuck tail and run for the zone  jump the balcony to buy ya some time and he will pop right up at the zone in for ya.<br />
<br />
as far as the clicker working post lvl 56 yes it does,  I had a friend complete hers at lvl 53 and it worked,  I have heard it works as long as you are lvl 51.<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">When I camped Gimblox is SolA it was right after a small group of guildies ran wild in Kith, Najena, and Unrest to get some epic items for a mage in our guild. The others left and me *lvl 52*, the mage *lvl 40* and the druid *lvl 56* were bored so we decided to wander SolA for a while to see if the goblin I needed would spawn. I tossed my map aside in confusion and the druid made an attempt at tracking the PHs in that horrible maze. We found the room within a minute with only one tiny turn around. After hanging out and killing things for about an hour with the goblins in that area conning blue and light blue to the mage but green to me and the druid... a lvl 59 cleric shows up angry that we were camping what he was needing. He asked if any of us were clerics and after a few smart remarks from our silly mage I told him that I was indeed a cleric camping the ring. He promptly starts killing all the goblins around us all the while insisting he would never KS the epic spawn *yeah right not with the childish way he was behaving* I ran back into the room and sat there and a minute later he spawns. The other cleric throws in some hits, but how does he expect to outdamage a cleric, druid, and mage with fire pet? I dont think so! I loot the ring, the other cleric whines and camps, and we went on our merry way out of SolA and continuted our journeys elsewhere. I am SO SO SO glad I was NOT there alone or that higher lvl cleric would have the ring and I would not. Gotta say... I LOVE my guildies!! Spellblade Alliance ROCKS!<br />

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">That one of my problems. The guild Im a part of has lost alot of 50+ people to more uber guilds promosing more help with their epics and better gear. So our guild is small and only has a handful over 50 and no one over 54. So getting guild help on things is difficult. We have a joke that we are a stepping stone guild and that people use us till they can get better lol. Frustrating cause i'd have alot more help if it wasn;t for that. Oh well anyone else from Xegony is on and can help at some point witht hese spawns Send em a tell ya know my name :)</td>

No, that high-level cleric would NOT have had the ring. That "angry" "childish" cleric was me. I killed king room spawns once. I stopped when you said your companion was getting xp from them. I never touched Grimblox....even mentioned he had popped. Sometimes when someone says they wouldn't KS....they actually do mean it.<br />
Perhaps had your companion not started with the smart remarks...you would have been less worried. Funny, I recall going to the zone...silently...and not camping. <br />
Amazing how details get distorted in the telling. But no hard feelings. You had it camped fair and square. I got the punk the next night.</td>

If you are having trouble getting the seeker to the zone with him beating on you do this. Dont turn it in. Have someone (a tank is best but anyone with hp will do)aggro the seeker and run him to the zoneline. You should not get touched really. Have that person zone with the seeker at the zone in. Once aggro is zoned, turn in and kill him. No getting lost, or dieing and having to redo your hard work.<br />
<br />
Also if you are having trouble with Ixiblat just a bit of useful information. His ae proc is front side only. So get all your melee on its back side. If not your going to do a lot of healing that could be going to your Main tank.<br />
<br />
Hope some of this helps out at least one person.<br />
