------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
If you are a non-raiding cleric (I've returned to mine and am not raiding) then you will find differant AAs much more valuable than a raiding cleric would. Raiding clerics are going to have advantages given them from gear that that make certain AAs "useless" to them, or not worth the points, while other AAs are going to be likewise valuable for them are going to be very situationally useful, if at all, for a non-raiding cleric. This is because they really are almost two entirely differant games, principally due to the massive power boost that raid-aquired gear can give in relation to bazaar bought or quested, and even compared to what is available via LDoN.<br />
<br />
For the casual, or more specifically the non-raiding cleric so as to avoid "but I'm a casual raider" or "I'm a hardcore non-raider." I suggest the following:<br />
<br />
* Archetype abilities range from very useful to amazingly useful, and the first among these is going to be spell casting mastery. Getting this to level 3 effectively gives the non-raiding cleric a mana preservation IV item they will never lose (ie. soulbound) that does not require an inventory slot. It will apply only to their highest specialization spells (better be alteration for a cleric!) and its one of those AAs that all clerics should stop and get before passing 62 at the latest. In my raiding days, in substantially substandard gear, and shortly after joining one of the better (at the time) raiding guilds of my server, it gave me far better "field endurance" than a level 65 cleric with greater levels of flowing thought and a larger equipped manapool!<br />
<br />
* After SCM3, I would suggest picking up Radiant Cure1 and Divine Arbitration1, as these can be very handy in situations, especially in dungeons, if your tank is dropping faster than a cheal can land. Popping that evens out the damage taken, plus a 20% penalty (at level1 divine arbitration), evenly among the group, which if everyone is buffed with virtue, or even Blessing of Aegolism or similar hp buffs, can then give you time to get a cheal on the main tank, and let your paladin use healing wave to top everyone off and get better aggro on themselves.<br />
<br />
* Those done its time to go back to archetypes and "camp" them for a while. The next big AA for a non-raiding cleric is Combat Agility, and getting it to level 3 (with all archetypes, its almost always better to pick one, and get it to 3 before doing another.) With a lower armor class than a raiding cleric, lower defense skills overall, and effectively chain-class mitigation skills despite the plate armor, anything that causes mobs to miss can make the differance between a cleric having to hit Divine Barrier and one that can stay alive long enough for adds to get mezzed, the tank to get aggro back, or to channel a heal on themselves or someone else.<br />
<br />
* After Combat Agility, I recommend Channeling Focus. Pretty much for the same reason. Even with maxed CA, you will get hit, and hits that knock you back will almost always interrupt spells, and for long cast spells like cheal, this can be bad, especially if it happens with 1 second left. You might not have time to recover. Channeling Focus dramatically improves your ability to channel through hits, which if nothing else might give you the ability to channel that divine barrier or gate if needed (gating only on a wipe, if your CC person is dead and the tank as well, and only if bound immediately outside the dungeon.)<br />
<br />
* After that, the other AAs are all useful for the grouping cleric, even Mental Clarity 3. Flowing Thought Items are difficult to get, or expensive to get, and with a potentially smaller manapool, and/or needing to heal non-raiding tanks more often, every bit of mana regen helps and can make a huge differance. In a full set of LDoN armor, getting every possible FT augment that isn't type8 (Time gear is the only gear that has type8 augment slots) will only give FT9, combine with a Solstice Earring and thats FT10, adding in Mental Clarity 3 (expensive pointwise) represents a 33% boost in per-tick mana regen outside of medding or FT buffs like KEI or better. If nothing else, it can reduce the duration of med breaks should they be needed, which can make or break a dungeon run. Remember while clerics can learn to maximize their use of healing mana efficiency-wise, they rarely have the option of simply not-healing the way other classes can not-nuke.<br />
<br />
* Healing Adept adds a flat bonus to the strength or power of your heals always. Basically useless for a grouping cleric in regards to complete heal, but for the other direct heals, it can nicely bump the power of supernal remedy, diminishing the need to use a spell like supernal light which heals another 1000 points max, but for 200 pts more mana (600 in total.)<br />
<br />
* Healing Gift gives increasing chances for critcal heals, called exceptional heals, and stacked with Healing Adept can occasionally produce amazing results with even the simplest spells. Last night with HA1 and HG1, I dropped a "patch" heal on our puller that I intended to follow up with a stronger heal (ie. cheal) that I managed to get a "crit" on. The exceptional heal doubles the power, and when combined with Healing Adept even at level 1, meant the "patch" put the bard-puller from 40% to 90% in one cast (2.5k heal was nice) Healing Gift and Healing Adept at 3, are also prerequisites for the few actually non-raid-useful class AAs clerics get (most of our class AAs are designed around raiding, I would like to see more that are more generally useful myself)<br />
<br />
* Spell Casting Fury is another nice one, but comes under the category of "fun" more than necessary. A cleric with full mana has a choice, nuke a bit or get up and swing that proccing hammer. Spell Casting Fury gives a chance to get wizard-like critical blasts with any direct damage spell, and that includes weapon procs. Given the anemic melee DPS of a cleic, this is a real way for them to improve their DPS, especially given the better proc rates of the higher end hammers. Considering its mana free on the hammer (once summoned), improving the amount of damage per proc can nicely add to DPS should the cleric not need to heal as much, and still want to save mana for heals later.<br />
<br />
* Spell Casting Reinforcement increases the duration of beneficial spells, including YaulpV which is a nice way of getting "standing" mana regen in a fast moving group and help offset the need for med breaks. It also increases the duration, and thus the total healing power of your heal over time spells, at level 3 instead of 500 a tick for 4 ticks for 2000 hp healed for 400 mana, you can do the same for 6 ticks for 3000hp healed. Since heal over time spells are treated like buffs instead of heals, they are very low aggro and a nice tool to have and have strongre.<br />
<br />
* Natural Durability and Combat Stability will als dramatically improve your ability to take a beating as a cleric. The former gives a bonus to your hit points that is cumulative with stamina boosting effects, as well as hp buffing spells, meaning not only does it improve your unbuffed hit points, it also increase the hit points gained from buffs of all sorts, a dead cleric heals no one, so extra hit points are also good, and can give your tank or CC more time to get a mob off you before you get low-health aggro. Combat Stability does what SOE needs to do for all clerics, improve their base mitigation. It reduces the chances by an increasing amount per level that any given hit will not be for max, but for a lower amount. <br />
<br />
In terms of the class AAs, I honestly am hard-pressed to recommend Mass Group Buff unless you are planning on raiding. For clerics that don't raid, MGB is almost useless and the last time I used it was for "fun" when an enchanter in a WF camp used MGB to give everyone Voice of Quellious, I returned the favor by doing MGB of Hand of Virtue.<br />
<br />
Celestial Regeneration and Divine Rez are the two best class AAs for clerics that don't raid. The former gives you a nice mana-free group heal-over-time spell that can really make divine arbitration a handy way to extend your manapool even further, and make you more effective, or possibly give you a bit more freedom to melee or even nuke a bit. Both require either HG or HA at 3, so getting those archetype AAs is doubly important for that reason. Bestow Divine Aura is also a good one for clerics, it gives them a third Divine Aura/Barrier spell that they don't need a spell-slot for, and can be cast on others, including your enchanter who is taking a pounding from mobs and would die without it.<br />
<br />
Others, such as Unfailing Divinity, aren't useful for non-raiding clerics and are generally as big a waste of points for them as MC3 would be for a raiding cleric. One cleric class AA to avoid until its fixed is Turn Undead which combines an AE undead-only fear with a damage over time effect. The problem is that if fear breaks early, and it often does, the dot fades along with it. I haven't met a cleric yet that has this AA that wishes they never bought it.<br />
<br />
In terms of PoP AAs, I recommend ignoring the general PoP AAs, and after getting Radiant Cure and Divine Arbitration (which you should have each at level 1) it starts becoming a toss up between maxing those and/or maxing Lightning Reflexes and Innate Defense, to further improve your survivability when dealing with healing aggro in some situations. Getting AAs to further boost healing from the PoP selection is less likely to be needed by a grouping cleric than a raiding cleric, since its rarely strength of heal that matters, but mana efficiency and mana recovery. Once someone is fully healed, healing more is sorta pointless <br />
<br />
This is when getting AAs to boost weaker stats and bump weaker resists starts becoming tempting. Given the lower quality of gear available to a non-raiding cleric, these AAs become even more important to compensate, especially if you've been selecting your gear with wis/mana in mind. Improving your stamina and dexterity will help with hit points and proc rate somewhat, not hugely, but better than nothing. Improving agility is of marginal use, as is improving strength, except that improving strength will improve your attack rating (anemically low for clerics, even with maxed weapon and offense skill) and if you are playing battle-cleric rather than nuking-cleric, can help your DPS a little. Planar Power and PoP further boosts can give you more lattitude in selecting gear for effects rather than stat bonuses, and in terms of improving resists, the same is true there as well.<br />
<br />
Again, if you raid, the above is not good advice, but what is good for a raider isn't good for a non-raider, and vice-versa. Similarly, while levelling before getting AA is excellent advice for raiders (generally) its terrible advice for people who don't raid or are in smaller social/family type guilds. The post-60 game is balanced around people with raid level gear for the most part, and trying to survive there without it can be rough, having enough AA to compensate for weaker gear and lack of level IV focus effects, can make a huge differance for non-raiders in the post-60 game, even though they are slower and harder to come by at lower levels relative to at 65, they can provide the additional character power needed to compete at those levels.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Let's see...<br />
<br />
>Archetype abilities range from very useful to amazingly useful, and the first among these is going to be spell casting mastery. <br />
Absolutely.<br />
<br />
>After SCM3, I would suggest picking up Radiant Cure1 and Divine Arbitration1<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
>The next big AA for a non-raiding cleric is Combat Agility, and getting it to level 3<br />
Disagree. CA is definitely useful, but not first priority. I raid though, so that may skew my opinion. FWIW, I got ND before CA because mobs do hit you with AEs and spell effects too.<br />
<br />
>After Combat Agility, I recommend Channeling Focus.<br />
Read the AA FAQ and my personal stance on CF will be pretty clear. Others would agree with this guy.<br />
<br />
>After that, the other AAs are all useful for the grouping cleric, even Mental Clarity 3.<br />
MC is useful, but unlike other archetype abilities, I don't necessarily suggest going 1-2-3 with it. With other abilities, the effect is scaled, but MC is diminishing returns. 6 points for 1 FT isn't necessarily worth it when you've only got 30 AA.<br />
<br />
>Healing Adept...Basically useless for a grouping cleric in regards to complete heal,<br />
Yep, it's no good for elixirs or Complete Heals. If you use these more than straight heals, don't prioritize it.<br />
<br />
>Healing Gift...can occasionally produce amazing results with even the simplest spells.<br />
This is true, and it works with Complete Heal (for whatever that's worth.) The more important side of HG3 is that it's a prerequisite for some class abilities.<br />
<br />
>Spell Casting Fury is another nice one, but comes under the category of "fun" more than necessary.<br />
Definitely agree.<br />
<br />
>Natural Durability and Combat Stability will als dramatically improve your ability to take a beating as a cleric.<br />
He's not completely accurate about how CS works, but yes. ND > CA > CS imho.<br />
<br />
>For clerics that don't raid, MGB is almost useless <br />
Absolutely. MGB is for buffing more than 6 people at a time. We in the business call these raids. (Well, some people call them business opportunities.)<br />
<br />
>Celestial Regeneration and Divine Rez are the two best class AAs for clerics that don't raid.<br />
I agree with CR; it's great. DR I disagree with, but since he doesn't explain himself, I won't attack that comment.<br />
<br />
>Bestow Divine Aura is also a good one for clerics, it gives them a third Divine Aura/Barrier spell that they don't need a spell-slot for, and can be cast on others, including your enchanter who is taking a pounding from mobs and would die without it.<br />
<3 BDA. That is all.<br />
<br />
>Unfailing Divinity...(not) useful for non-raiding clerics and are generally as big a waste of points for them as MC3 would be for a raiding cleric.<br />
UD is worthless to a non-raider. MC3 is NOT worthless to a raiding cleric. Having FT15 from items, assuming that the raiding cleric can accomplish this, does not prohibit him from wanting more mana regen. If it did, I wouldn't care about getting clarity, SD, and Po9/AoZ up all the time.<br />
<br />
>One cleric class AA to avoid until its fixed is Turn Undead which combines an AE undead-only fear with a damage over time effect. The problem is that if fear breaks early, and it often does, the dot fades along with it. I haven't met a cleric yet that has this AA that wishes they never bought it.<br />
The reason fear breaks early, and only time it ever will, is if the target is too high-level to be feared. SOE actually changed this - now the ability won't work at all on them. I got level 1 for fun and to finish my class title; for that I don't regret having it. I was stupid and got level 2 though, so it would actually do some damage. That I regret...still I plan on getting level 3 some day just to finish it off. Consider me the exception here, though.<br />
<br />
>In terms of PoP AAs, I recommend ignoring the general PoP AAs,<br />
For the mostpart yes, but for the mostpart they're just extensions of the skills in general you should avoid anyway. Innate Enlightenment and Planar Power are good for keeping your wisdom uncapped, and you should take advantage of this, as able, to boost your mana pool.<br />
<br />
>since its rarely strength of heal that matters, but mana efficiency and mana recovery.<br />
I'll pretty well agree with this statement.<br />
<br />
>This is when getting AAs to boost weaker stats and bump weaker resists starts becoming tempting.<br />
You have to have a lot of AA imho for stat and resist bumps to look appealing. I have 280 AA and only have a few points into Poison Resist. I've pretty well tapped out everything else I would care for and would be going for more resists now, but I'm starting to save for next expansion; we'll see what that brings!<br />
As he indicates, Sta and Dex are going to be your two best picks for stats though.<br />
<br />
>Again, if you raid, the above is not good advice, but what is good for a raider isn't good for a non-raider, and vice-versa.<br />
I disagree with this strongly. There are a few select abilities (Mass Group Buff, Unfailing Divinity) that are worthless to a non-raiding cleric. For the mostpart, imho, the two are hardly mutually exclusive otherwise. You may have a shift in priorities, but not a totally new to-do list.<br />
<br />
>trying to survive there without it can be rough, having enough AA to compensate for weaker gear and lack of level IV focus effects,<br />
This does not mean that doubling up on these is not worthwhile. The implication he makes is that if I have FT15, I don't need MC3. If I have Improved Healing IV, I don't need Healing Adept. This is definitely not true.<br />
<br />
In any event, it's obvious he focuses on the grouping cleric, and I spend my time divided, so I have a different slant. It's not a bad guide, but there are some things I find Zanros to be in error on. I'm curious to see what others have to say though, since I'm always a big blowhard when it comes to AA choices.</td>

<font color="silver">Here's my question.... What if you're one of those Clerics who isn't in a raid guild in your lower 50's but you aren't sure if you might do that in the future? Is there any sort of "balancing act" so you don't lean too heavily towards non-raid and then join a raid guild, or the other way around?<br />
<br />
I'm curious. I highly doubt I'll ever be in a "raid" guild (at least on my cleric) but there are a couple of raid guilds that I'm allied with and they have on occassion invited me along. In those instances, I'd be a lacking-raider. But at the same time, I don't want to go "raid Cleric mode" if I don't raid as frequently as say the top raid guilds on my server do.<br />

there is NO BEST way to go. go with what feels right at the time. if you get scm 1 then decide to get mc 1. your not going to see that big of difference then if you got scm2 before you got mc 1... it is a big toss up what to get first, there are so many usefull ones that once you get, you won't know how you lived without them. out of all the aa's, the ones i think were most important, order to get them don't matter, as long as you get them..<br />
<br />
run 3<br />
scm 3<br />
DvA 3<br />
RC 1 at least<br />
HG3<br />
CR<br />
<br />
would also recomend a MC 1 or 2 in here<br />
<br />
once you have those.... you will wonder how you ever got along without them. and those are for raiding, AND non raiding clerics.<br />
<br />
if you are a battle cleric like me, i would toss some scf in there as well. my hammer now crits for 300 and it crits alot!!! scf3 is a huge difference over scf2.<br />
<br />
and don't count out the scmr these will save you dots in the long run, but once again are NICE to have, but not NEEDED. i feel all the ones in my first list are needed, must haves.<br />
<br />
once again, do what feels right at the time. there is no set path</td>

Personally I recommend ND3 before CA3, MC1 is good early for 2 AA's. I'd get MC2 and 3 as needed, there is definately a steep slope of diminishing returns here.<br />
<br />
Kay, I wouldn't worry about any AA's pre-62 than run3. I had 3 AA's at 65 and didn't regret it at all. If you raid and are on CH chains lot you might want SCM3 before 65. As far as raiding AA's go, it depends on what your role is on raids. If you're on patch heal a lot you might want Healing Adept / Gift and Celestial Regen sooner, if not then maybe SCRM and MGB for buffs, or BDA and DvA3 to save tanks. Basically though I wouldn't worry about AA's much until level 65. <br />
<br />
For groups SCM3 and MC3 will go the farthest, along with defensive AA's since you take a lot more hits in smaller groups.</td>
