	<b><font color="#FCC504">What is the best race for a cleric?</font></b><br />
<br />
There isn't a single "best race" for a cleric character; all of the races which can be clerics make fairly good ones, and there are players at the highest level of the game from all the different races. Pick a race that appeals to you and stick with it.<br />
<br />
If you really can't decide, then casual cleric players would be well advised to start a dwarf or a high elf, since these races have good starting factions and no significant drawbacks. More hardcore cleric players would find dwarf or high elf a reasonable choice as well, but might also want to consider dark elves (which have the best vision of any of the cleric races, and get some useful toys and the ability to hide, but suffer faction issues) or halflings (which can hide and sneak, and also receive an experience bonus). Roleplayers might enjoy any of the cleric races.<br />
<br />
It is particularly unusual to see very high level erudite or gnome clerics, so if you want a very unique character, you may wish to choose one of these races.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">How should I allocate my starting stats?</font></b><br />
<br />
1. Wisdom: Your WIS affects your total mana pool, and it is probably the most important stat for a cleric. It isn't a bad idea to put as many as 20 or 25 points into WIS on creation. However, some clerics feel that high-end cleric gear has a lot of +WIS on it already, and there are diminishing returns once your WIS passes 200, so there are arguments in favour of putting some points into other stats as well. WIS has no effect on the rate at which you regenerate mana.<br />
<br />
2. Stamina: Your STA affects how many HP you have, making it the second most important stat for a cleric. It is also relatively hard to find gear which adds STA compared to WIS or STR, so points put into STA are unlikely to be wasted.<br />
<br />
3. Strength: An issue for the weaker cleric races, and a particularly common problem for High Elves, is that they are expected to wear full plate armour but have low STR with which to carry it all around. A few points put into STR early in the game can certainly make the early levels easier.<br />
<br />
Unless there are roleplaying reasons why you wish to boost your AGI, DEX, INT, or CHA, then it is probably not a good idea to allocate starting points into these stats, which are of much less value to a cleric.</font></td>

<br />
First, if you do not have a mana preservation focus item suitable for the highest level of spells you can cast, then it's important that you work out a way to get hold of one.<br />
<br />
If you are level 51+, the next most important thing is Flowing Thought. Flowing Thought items increase your mana regeneration rate, but almost all of them will not work if you are under level 51. There are a few tradeable Flowing Thought items - which tend to be massively expensive - and the best way to get a point of Flowing Thought is to do your Earring of the Solstice quest in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
After that, worry about your AC, your HP, and your mana pool. (STA and WIS are also relevant but only because they add to your HP and mana pool respectively).<br />
<br />
Most high end clerics agree that once your AC is over 1,000 then the returns for increasing your AC further are small. However, AC is certainly a factor for lower-level clerics. You're a cleric, not a finger-wiggler, and the sight of a cleric in a dress always makes me cringe... put yer damn plate on!<br />
<br />
As a rule of thumb, at high levels, one point of WIS is worth around 12 mana; one point of STA is worth around 3 HP. Once you have 200 in a stat, that yield is roughly halved; get past 255, and it's halved again. Items that add direct +HP and +mana may well be preferable to items that add +WIS and +STA, particularly at lower levels or very high WIS/STA totals.<br />
<br />
I'm grateful to Nyvn and Restandre for deriving the best formula we have so far on how your WIS affects your mana pool:- (Wisdom up to 200* level / 5) + (Wisdom from 201-255 * level/10) + (Wisdom-over-255*level / 13) + (raw mana) = Total mana<br />
<br />
You do not need to max out your WIS if you can get better returns with a low-WIS item. Shields of Bane Warding and Bracers of Sense are for pansy leather-wearing treehuggers, mmkay? ;P<br />
<br />
The rough principle is:-<br />
<br />
For 51+ clerics: Mana Preservation &gt; Flowing Thought &gt; HP = Mana &gt; AC = resists.<br />
For 1-50 clerics: Mana Preservation &gt; AC &gt; HP = Mana &gt; resists.<br />
<br />
<font color="#FCC504"><b>How do focus items work?</b></font><br />
<br />
Extended Range items and Buff Duration items both have a fixed benefit. Extended Range III, for example, adds 15% to the maximum range of your level 60 or lower spells and this bonus is guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Reagent Conservation items have a chance to work. Reagent Conservation III, for example, has around a 15% chance of saving you a peridot when you cast Blessing of Aegolism.<br />
<br />
All the other items add a random benefit. Mana Preservation III, for example, will reduce the mana cost of your Blessing of Aegolism spell by between 1% and 15%; over time, the effect saves you an average of 10% of your mana usage.<br />
<br />
Most focus items do not work with Complete Healing; the exception is Extended Range foci, which do affect Complete Healing. Because CH is a level 39 spell, you only need Extended Range II to get the benefit.<br />
<br />
Improved Healing focus items are not particularly valuable for a cleric unless (a) you are below level 39 or (b) you are level 65 and fighting upper-tier PoP encounters.</font></td>

The consensus for the optimal path is:<br />
<br />
1. Run Speed 3.<br />
2. Regen, Metabolism, STA, or WIS (your choice).<br />
3. Spellcasting Mastery 3.<br />
4. Divine Arbitration 1.<br />
5. Radiant Cure 1.<br />
<br />
After that, opinions vary a little more, but raiding clerics will find Mass Group Buff useful, Spellcasting Reinforcement has a wide range of uses, and many clerics swear by Combat Agility and its upgrade Lightning Reflexes. For class AA, the most useful ones are Mass Group Buff, Spellcasting Reinforcement, and Bestow Divine Aura; Healing Adept is better than Healing Gift, but Healing Gift is needed to unlock some of the class AA.<br />
<br />
Spellcasting Mastery is so important because it reduces the mana cost of all of your spells, including Complete Healing.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">MGB Blessing of Aegolism should cost 4,000 mana but I only have 3,500 - will I be able to use it?</font></b><br />
<br />
Yes. MGB will use double the mana cost of the spell if that much mana is available, but you can cast it with the mana cost of the spell +1; in other words, if you have 2,001 mana or more, MGB BoA will go off (but leave you out of mana).<br /></font></td>

	<i>NB: In this section, when I say `horse` I mean `horse or drogmor` unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</i><br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">How do horses work?</font></b><br />
<br />
You will need to enable Luclin models for your race, plus Horses and Elementals, for this to work.<br />
<br />
If you are riding a horse and not moving or meleeing, then you are considered to be sitting. That means that you get the sitting mana regeneration of +26 mana per tick (assuming that you have maximum Meditation skill) over and above your normal mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
While riding a horse you are considered to be standing for the purposes of aggro rather than sitting, which means that monsters are less likely to thump you.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">Should I get a horse or a drogmor?</font></b><br />
<br />
Horses eat less and look better, but if you play in first person view, you will have two horse ears in the middle of your view screen which can be annoying for some people (you can get rid of the ears by being shrunk). Drogmors eat slightly more and look ugly, but don't have the annoying ears.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">What are the drawbacks of a horse?</font></b><br />
<br />
1. You can't duck to interrupt spellcasting while riding a horse. You have to click off the horse buff or type /dism in order to duck successfully.<br />
<br />
2. You can't use a horse indoors.<br />
<br />
3. The horse takes some time to get `up to speed` and some time to slow down again afterwards, so you can't stop on a dime the way you could while running.<br />
<br />
4. The horse doesn't work if you are meleeing.<br /></font></td>

	<b><font color="#FCC504">What is a CH rotation and how do I set one up?</font></b><br />
<br />
Until the very topmost tier of the Planes of Power, the best healing spell which a cleric has is Complete Healing. It heals 7,500hp in 10 seconds, or 750hp per second.<br />
<br />
Some critters, particularly boss monsters from the Velious expansion or later, hit so hard and so fast that one cleric chain-casting Complete Healing will not be able to keep up with the damage. Alternatively, Complete Healing may generate too much aggro and the cleric may be killed; or it may take so long to kill the critter that one cleric would run out of mana. The solution to all of these problems is the CH rotation or CH ring.<br />
<br />
In a CH ring, two or more clerics take turns in casting Complete Healing on the raid's "Main Tank" (MT). Because several clerics are being used, you can time the ring to land a CH every few seconds and so heal a lot more HP per second; the aggro is spread among several clerics so they are less likely to be at the top of the monster's `Hate List`; and you can obviously do a lot more healing before your clerics run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Details vary, and more experienced clerics frequently prefer a very simple CH ring structure without using the /pause command, but if you're new to this, then the best way to set up a CH ring is to have a dedicated chat channel for the ring and to use /pause.<br />
<br />
Each cleric is assigned a number and is told what the /pause for the ring will be. Let's imagine that there are four clerics and they are using /pause 40. The first cleric would make a hotkey like this:-<br />
<br />
/cast 1<br />
/4 ----1---- Complete Healing %t ----1----<br />
/cast 1<br />
/pause 40<br />
/4 NEXT<br />
<br />
(This obviously assumes that Complete Healing is in spell slot one and that the CH ring chat channel is channel 4.)<br />
<br />
The second cleric's hotkey would read the same, but the second line would be:-<br />
<br />
/4 ----2---- Complete Healing %t ----2----<br />
<br />
When running, the CH ring chat channel would look like this:-<br />
<br />
Cleric_01 tells CHring(4), `----1---- Complete Healing Maintank ----1----`<br />
Cleric_01 tells CHring(4), `NEXT`<br />
Cleric_02 tells CHring(4), `----2---- Complete Healing Maintank ----2----`<br />
Cleric_02 tells CHring(4), `NEXT`<br />
Cleric_03 tells CHring(4), `----3---- Complete Healing Maintank ----3----`<br />
(etc.)<br />
<br />
The reason for numbering the clerics is so that if one dies, goes LD, runs out of mana, or otherwise is out of commission, then you can skip one cleric but still keep the rotation going smoothly.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">What /pause do I use for critter `X` ?</font></b><br />
<br />
The answer is, I'm afraid, that it varies according to your tank. If you have a level 65 tank with 400AA who's wearing the best gear in the game, then you might use a slow rotation or none at all; but a level 59 tank with 3AA wearing some stuff he bought in the bazaar would need a very different ring.<br />
<br />
More experienced clerics also tend to use slower rings because they have a `feel` for the situation and they can speed up if they sense that they need to; but if you're new to CH rings, the best advice is, don't try to be creative. When in doubt, start with the fastest ring your clerics can handle, and if it's unnecessarily fast, you can slow it down for the next attempt.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">How do raids divide up the loot?</font></b><br />
<br />
Raiding guilds have three main ways of deciding who gets which item:-<br />
<br />
1. Loot council: The raid leader, or some other person or council of people decide directly who gets what without any input from the people who are raiding.<br />
<br />
2. Random: Items are /randomed among people who can use them. Sometimes a `weighted` random system is used where some people (e.g. those who are full members of a guild as opposed to trials, or those who are higher in level) get to roll different dice to others; or the raid leader may decide that `only warriors can roll for Item X.`<br />
<br />
3. DKP/Merit: People earn `points` or `merit` (DKP stands for Dragon Kill Points) for attending raids. When they have enough merit, they can spend it on buying an item for themselves. DKP systems can sometimes become extremely complex and cumbersome.<br />
<br />
All of these ways have serious drawbacks as well as advantages.</font></td>

	<i>I'm grateful to Restandre for this section.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Divine Aura:</b> This spell makes you completely immune to attack for 18 seconds. Creatures attacking you will find another target if there is one during this time. Knowing when to use this spell takes a lot of experience, as it takes 10 minutes from memorization to use, and another 10 minutes after casting to reuse. You also will normally need to be able to channel it through other creatures hitting you. It's still a VERY important spell, and the only level 1 spell you will use forever.<br />
<br />
<b>Gate and Bind Affinity:</b> There is a place all players go when they die. No, not the afterlife. They go to their bind point. Gate takes you there with the luxury of taking your clothes with you. Bind Affinity lets you move this point to (nearly) anywhere you choose. Being able to return to a set point can be very helpful, either to be near a dungeon you might die inside of, or to get back to town and to a bank, or any other number of circumstances. As a cleric, the dungeon scenario is especially important for you, as if you can get back to the bodies, you can bring everyone else back and are often expected to, but nobody can do that for you.<br />
<br />
<b>Hammer of XXX:</b> A hammer you can summon as an impromptu weapon. At lower levels, they aren't worth much at all, except maybe for help on a corpse recovery. At higher levels, they start having decent stats and a proc called "Hand of the Gods" which does 75-150 damage fairly often and is unresistable. Many clerics able to summon one of these later hammers will do so when they log on.<br />
<br />
<b>"Rez" spells:</b> All titled Re-something, these spells will bring the fallen back to life, with experience returned from dying at increasing amounts for higher level versions of the spells to a maximum of 96% at level 56. In groups and raids where players are far from their bind points, you will want to resurrect them out of convenience. Players also loathe losing exp to death and it will not be uncommon for you to be asked to rez someone; it is possible to make money off "rez runs," but some clerics feel this is immoral and prefer to help people for the sake of helping them.<br />
<br />
<b>Imbue XXX:</b> You will be able to use one and only of these spells. They are used exclusively for tradeskilling and have no other benefit. You can find your imbue spell in your deity's home guild and likely nowhere else.<br />
<br />
<b>Atone:</b> Cast on a mob, Atone will drastically reduce it's hate list, usually to zero. This can help "reset" a mob that is hitting someone it shouldn't, or can be used to lose aggro on a mob rooted safely away from you. Be wary of using it in battle, as the tank will also lose any aggro that he had also.<br />
<br />
<b>Symbol of XXX:</b> This line of spells provides raw HP to their recipient. This is in addition to your other line of HP/AC buffs starting with Courage, Center, etc. However, symbols require reagents that you must have in your inventory, and are consumed upon usage. The most common of these reagents is the peridot, and many clerics will often be broke from buying 'dots. Talk to your group about compensation before casting these, until you get to higher levels where players understand that those spells cost money and are generally expected, and so players will make loot considerations for this.<br />
<br />
<b>Yaulp:</b> Self-only buff with short duration that improves your combat skills. Of questionable value and is far more frequently used by paladins. However, Yaulp V and Yaulp VI provide mana regen while they are active (which does not work when sitting or on a horse) that can make the spells very worth using when standing for any length.<br />
<br />
<b>Celestial Renewal/Healing/Elixir:</b> The HoT line (Heal over Time), also refered to as elixir, is a very useful set of spells that take experience to know how best to use. They are VERY condensed versions of a regeneration buff, that are more efficient than your normal heal at that level. Since they are buffs, Improved Healing (and HA) do not work with them, but Extended Enhancement (and SCR) do. There are also two higher level versions, Ethereal Elixir and Supernal Elixir.<br />
<br />
<b>Pure Blood:</b> This spell is quested in the zones of the Legacy of Ykesha expansion. Check the quests section for more details.<br />
<br />
<b>Remedy:</b> This is your first true cleric heal. Druids and shamans get a weaker version called chloroblast in a few levels, but you get this spell to yourself. It's faster than Superior Healing. It reaches farther. It's more efficient. It doesn't heal quite as much, but you will normally want to use it. The follow-up spell Ethereal Remedy is not a great spell, but Supernal Remedy comes shortly after it and is an amazing heal.<br />
<br />
<b>Mark of Karn:</b> Damage Shields are how much damage you take when you hit a creature (or they you.) Mark of Karn is the true opposite of this. You GAIN life for hitting a mob that has Mark of Karn. Effectively, it's a damage shield that inflicts negative damage, which is why people will often refer to it as a "reverse DS". The maximum gained per hit is up to 6, and based on your weapon delay; Mark of Kings increases this value to 9. The real advantage of this spell is that it overwrites mage line damage shields, which can often chew a group to pieces.<br />
<br />
<b>Mark of Retribution:</b> MoR is an odd variation on damage shields. Normally the damage is inflicted due to a buff on the person being hit. With MoR, the attacker takes damage for a debuff cast on him instead. This means the target will take damage from hitting *anything*. It does 15 points per hit, and Mark of the Righteous at level 65 does 35.<br />
<br />
<b>Hammer pet, aka Unswerving Hammer of Faith:</b> Yes, clerics do get a pet. No, it's not good for much of anything besides show. A cleric pet works exactly like an enchanter pet -- you can't command it and it hits whatever hits you -- but when it isn't compelled to attack anything, it dies. It also only has 100 HP and isn't terribly strong, but it will only take damage due to direct physical attacks, so as long as it doesn't get riposted it should live through a fight as long as nobody expects it to tank for a moment.<br />
<br />
<b>Remove Greater Curse:</b> An important spell for Ssra, VT, and the planes of power. If you are never in these zones, you should NOT CARE if you have this spell. It will be useless to you. It also only drops in Ssra, so you won't be able to get it anyway.(A couple other Luclin mobs do use curses.)<br />
<br />
Curses are a class of afflictions, like poisons or diseases, that can only be removed with it's own line of cure. Curses tend to be a bit nastier than dots though, since they aren't usually devastating from damage so much as some insidious effect like making you fizzle 90% of the time. So if you ARE in those zones mentioned before, you will want to try to get it, or at least basic Remove Curse, which drops off the Great Saphrophye in Paludal Caverns.<br />
<br />
<b>Blessed Armor of the Risen:</b> Part of a self-only buff line that includes two earlier versions and one later, plus an ancient spell. It's a typical HP/AC buff cast on you, but starting with BAoR, it also has mana regeneration on it. The unfortunate part is that it does not stack with shaman Focus spells, or with upper level druid HP buffs that also have mana regen on them. Unless you can get both Focus and Protection of the whatever, you will probably want to keep this up with your own HP buffs.<br />
<br />
<b>Aegolism:</b> Succeeded by Virtue, and with the addition of LoY preceded by Temperance, this spell combines your HP buff, your AC buff, and your symbol in one. It counts as all three in one package, so it grants roughly 1000 HP. It's part symbol, so it takes peridots to cast, and none of the three spells will stack with it (or anything equivalent like a druid buff). Very convenient spell to cast, but also pricy.<br />
<br />
<b>Blessing of Aegolism:</b> Succeeded by Hand of Virtue, this is the group version of Aegolism. It costs a whopping 2000 mana, so casting it after your group wipes will set you back another few minutes. Using it with MGB on a raid, however, can make your life much simpler. Aegolism is "too powerful" for a low-level target, but this effects everyone in group and can be cast on yourself; there's talk of Sony changing this, but for now that means even level 1 characters can walk around with an extra 1000 HP.  <i>Shadowfrost adds:  Since this section was written, Blessing of Aegolism has been changed.  It will not land on people under level 46 now.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Blessing of Reverence:</b> 10% spell haste to any and all spells that have a normal casting time of at least 3 seconds. Some people consider it worthless, but it can be a lifesaver at times. Also two lower level versions that have a level limit on which spells they work with.</font></td>

	There are five kinds of Velious armour: Plane of Growth, Thurgardin, Kael Drakkal, Skyshrine, and Plane of Mischief.<br />
<br />
Of those, the <b>Plane of Growth</b> armour is equivalent in quality to Thurgardin quest armour, but harder to obtain because of the sheer rarity of the drops in PoG.<br />
<br />
The <b>Thurgardin</b> stuff is easy to obtain by hanging around with a few friends in the place variously known across different servers as the Riff House or the Plate House. It also drops behind the Arena in Kael Drakkal, although rather more rarely.<br />
<br />
These two kinds of armour might be considered the `basic` Velious armour and in my view they are the least desirable.<br />
<br />
The <b>Kael Drakkal</b> armour quest pieces drop in the Western Temple of Veeshan. They are fairly common, and the armour that results is of medium desirability.<br />
<br />
The <b>Plane of Mischief</b> armour quest pieces theoretically drop in the Plane of Mischief, and the quests to obtain the armour are quite complex. I say "theoretically drop" because in practise, the drop rate is so low that you need to clear the plane completely several times in order to receive the quest parts for a single piece of armour. Obtaining it is impractical.<br />
<br />
The Kael Drakkal and Plane of Mischief armour pieces have better stats than the PoG/Thurg armour and might be considered "middle of the range" in desirability.<br />
<br />
The <b>Skyshrine</b> armour which drops in the Eastern Temple of Veeshan - the area known as the Halls of Testing - has the best stats for a cleric, and if you're in a guild which can raid this area, then it drops very frequently compared to the other Velious quest armours.<br />
<br />
So if you're in the fortunate position of being able to choose, go Thurgardin at first (while you build up faction), then Skyshrine when you have the necessary faction and levels.<br />
<br />
You also need to know that the plate armour made by tradeskillers is, in some cases, as good as or better than the Skyshrine stuff.<br />
<br />
In particular, Cultural plate bracers are notably better than Velious quest gear, and the Hurricane plate gauntlets are also considerably better.</font></td>

<b><font color="#FCC504">How do I make a healing hotkey?</font></b><br />
<br />
As a general rule, younger clerics would be well-advised to call their heals. There are some high-end clerics who don't, but those high-end clerics are usually grouped with more experienced people who are very accustomed to working together.<br />
<br />
Let's imagine that the spell `Light Healing` is in your first spell slot. Your healing hotkey might look like this:-<br />
<br />
/cast 1 (casts the spell in your first spell slot)<br />
/g Light healing for %t<br />
/cast 1 (by repeating this, if you fizzle the first cast attempt, you will automatically retry)<br />
<br />
Some clerics like to include standing and sitting commands with their hotkeys, but I wouldn't recommend this for a younger cleric.<br />
<br />
If you are the only healer, some clerics advise their target that a heal is coming using /ttell:-<br />
<br />
/cast 1<br />
/ttell Incoming Light Healing (sends a tell to your target)<br />
/cast 1<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">What commands can you use in macros?</font></b><br />

%t - returns your target.<br />
%s - returns the subjective pronoun (he, she, it) for your target.<br />
%o - returns the objective pronoun (him, her, it) for your target.<br />
%p - returns the possessive pronoun (his, her, its) for your target.<br />
%r - returns your target's race.<br />

<b><font color="#FCC504">What DvA does:</font></b><br />
<br />
It takes the damage taken by your party and splits it evenly among them. It has a .75 sec cast time, and is very hard to interupt. <br />
<br />
There are 3 levels of this AA. Each one has a different "penalty" attached to it. <br />
<br />
The first level has a 20% penalty on the damage thats distributed. If you distibute 6k damage in a party of 6 each member will take 1200 damage. <br />
<br />
The second level has a 10% penalty on the damage that is distibuted. If you distribute 6k damage in a partty of 6 each member will take 1100 damage.<br />
<br />
The third level has no penalty. If you distibute 6k damge in a party of 6 each member will take 1000 damage.<br />
<br />
You cannot directly kill someone with DvA. I have logs proving this here. However you can take someone so low that they get low hp agro.<br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FCC504">When should I use DvA?</font></b><br />
<br />
Well, it's a great lifesaver if a member of your party looses HP so fast that nothign else would be able to heal enough hp fast enough to save them. My favorite times to use it are when I mis time a Cheal/the tank takes a sudden burst of damage and my Cheal won't land in time. It's also great for saving your slowers life when they get agro. It can also be used on raids to catch the MT if nothing else would eb able to save him. With a Paladin Mt this becomes even more useful, simply hit DvA and then they use a group heal to lock aggro.</font></td>

	When a druid, ranger, paladin, shaman, or beastlord casts Greater Healing, it heals 300hp. When a cleric casts it, it heals 315.<br />
<br />
According to Lucy, Supernal Remedy heals 1450hp; those who have it will know that it really heals more than that (1522hp plus any bonuses from AA and gear).<br />
<br />
The reason is a bonus that's coded into the cleric class:- All clerical direct healing spells receive a bonus of +5% hp healed.</font></td>

	Unlike all of your other skills, which you need to train in order to acquire, level 25 clerics don't need to train Bash; it just suddenly appears in their skill listing. The reason why Bash works differently is that the Bash skill was not originally a core cleric ability, but was added much later on for class balance reasons, and the developers added the skill directly to the character file rather than putting it on the trainer.</font></td>

<br />
Until you train one (1) point in each specialization you won't be able to get above 50. So make sure you put a point into each, then keep working heals to get Alteration over 50 and you're all set. Since it's already at 50 it's a cakewalk for you as you're pretty much guaranteed alteration will go above 50.<br />
<br />
If you somehow mess it up you can reset your specializations fairly easily.<br />
<br />
In Temple of Solusek Ro there's an NPC named Ostorm. If you talk to him he'll offer to change your specialization for a Ruby and 50 gp. What basically happens is that all your specializations are reset to 49 and then you work the one you want back up over 50.</font></td>

Cultural armour is excellent tradeskill-made armour for a cleric, and makes a very good "basic set" that you can upgrade from.<br />
