	<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><i>Shadows caused by the wild flames in the great fireplace within the bedchamber danced upon the smooth stone walls. It was late evening and the room was rather dim, lighted only by the fire and a few candles. The faint scent of burning lingered in the air. The roaring of the blaze the only sound in the room.<br />
<br />
Faeryln lay upon the settee staring, unblinking, at the vaulted ceiling. Watching the ever changing pattern of the shadows and remaining few wisps of smoke that had risen and caught there. Her face bore no emotion. Her features totally blank...flat...as though not her face at all but a mask. She wore an ornate ebon velvet gown inlaid with sheer panels that fitted the top half of her form exquisitely then flared out, draping over her legs and spilling onto the floor. Broken glass lay scattered beside her, part of her gown having fallen into the mass of tiny shards. The entire chamber was in diasrray. Bedcurtains hung precariously by but a few threads and the linens were strewn about the bed. Scraps of cloth lay on the floor. Some furniture was even overturned. A tenative knock came upon the door...she closed her eyes with no other change to her visage as a sudden flood of memories overcame her. Memories of how all of this came to be... </i><br />
<br />
~----------------------------------------------------------------~<br />
<br />
<i>The images flickered through her mind, some chronological and others not. Some of the most prominent events in her life that had contributed to molding the woman that lay here now.<br />
<br />
She thought of her childhood. She had thought her life to be normal, yet, she had never seen Neriak. If that was the home city of her people, why did her parents never go there? Perhaps she had been a happy child. Her family did not stay in one place long enough to truly define that to her. They were nomadic, there was no real home. She was not raised with a traditional education and experience of the Teir'dal. An issue which occasionally arose in conversation with others. Recognition of these facts had begun at this young age to raise questions in her mind. Then there was <a href="http://p210.ezboard.com/fchurchofthebloodfrm15.showMessage?topicID=7.topic" target="_blank">the meeting</a> and how her life had changed then...<br />
<br />
A connection was severed and a path opened before her. Some semblance of a purpose and now she knew. So, she traveled...afterall what else did she know? She hunted, killed, studied, and learned. She found the mysterious Neriak and entered. As she learned about her own people and spent long hours or even days at a time in the great library or the Temple within the grand city, she became cynical. Perhaps it was her own confusion that made her burn, it seemed so unfair that she had been slighted of her own heritage. In time she thought much and researched even more and her sentiment for her former parents had transformed into rage then hatred. The more she hunted, the stronger she felt it, thus she battled continuously. Not long after these discoveries she began to speak with her peers, furthering her knowledge of customs both in society and battle. She formed close bonds with a few, having spent much time with those individuals and learning much from them.<br />
<br />
The next defining moment had been when her circle of companions had received their purpose, the first real directive from the Father. Their paths were to converge here and thus the Ministry of the Shadows was formed. Little time passed before other houses had taken notice of the Ministry. Considering the overall youth of its ministers, the Ministry was a powerful group. Within the first few months she had taken her surname as the Father instructed her, that of her late false parents and of a false house, Lhanavar. It was certainly not her wish, but she did as He bade her, surely there was reason.<br />
<br />
Some time passed and after nearly a century the Ministry's strength was well known among the Teir'dal society. There even came a time when one particular other had attempted to lure the Ministry into their fold, but it meant dissolution and the ministers recognized and vetoed the premise immediately. Such it was that deceit would not rend the Ministry apart. True, a few ministers had been lost to the temptations, most of which quickly regretted their weakness and realized the error. This rivalry continued for some time and it did not take long for Faeryln to develop a soul deep hatred of the leader of the other party. The very sight of this person set her blood to simmer. She tried to avoid ever crossing paths lest one day she make her feelings outwardly known by some rash action.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the situation had dissipated and little contact if any remained between the parties. Although Faeryln knew there had been some residual contact with Ravenar for a short time longer that the rest. She smiled a little at this image. Ravenar had been a companion to her for a very long time. He had in fact been her first hunting partner. Perhaps it was this, or perhaps it was his profession, a knight, that made her hold him in such reverence. Not that she would ever let him know that. they were equals and each had depended on the other on more than one occasion, regardless of the fact that they often disagreed upon many issues. There was a definitive mutual respect between them. Likely this was another factor which affected her reaction when the events that threatened to destroy the Ministry in totality had occurred. She shook her head sligyhtly so as not to remember the gruesome details of that painful time. She had performed rituals and enchantments which one of her experience and profession should not have been capable. The Father had looked over the Ministry during those dark days. He had lent her strength she certainly could not have possessed on her own. The Hall had been destroyed and much of the Ministry was in confusion over the happenings. Once leadership had been restored, Faeryln had seen to the reconstruction of the halls. However, one minister had been permanently lost and the Ministry mourned a long time friend.<br />
<br />
The Church. In the few months before the devastation, the Ministry had been forming a relationship of sorts with the Church. The two organizations had been talking frequently and even hunting together occasionally. She felt the two lent an enormous comraderie and power to one another. She was pleased with the association that had developed and though she found it somewhat intimidating, she also felt trust within the Church of the Blood. Who could know at that time the importance of that very association? A brief moment of calm gave way to further disaster. Upon escaping the rubble that was once the Ministry halls, she and several other ministers had gone to the Church. They sought assistance of the more experience and more powerful organization . The story was told, rest given and preparations made. A hunt ensued and it was not brief. The end result of that hunt saved a Teir'dal soul and ultimately had merged the Ministry of the Shadows within the folds of the Church of the Blood. <br />
<br />
Much change came to all involved with these events, ceremony, education, training. She ascended as the Prelate of the Mysteries taking her place among the ranks of the Church. The solemn ceremony had inspired her to further reseach and a renewed depth of faith. The blood brought her new understanding and in its ecstacy she had felt what is was to truly be one with the Father, her father. She knew what she did not before and a new manner of communication with him became known to her. All of this just in finding her place within the Church...oh but did that not also bring more? Yet another defining series of events... </i><br />
<br />
~-----------------------------------------------------------------------~<br />
<br />
<i>She had met him shortly after joining the ranks of the Church. He had gone out of his way to speak to her, welcoming her and the Ministry. She had mistaken his actions as simply being friendly. How naive indeed. Of course, she had noticed he was not as conversational to many of the others, although that was not unusual to her. He was handsome and she enjoyed talking to him, but that was as much thought as she had afforded him. Her entire life had just changed completely and she was still acclimating to her new purpose. After some time, it seemed he had moved on. Their conversation became more brief and few. She really had not taken much notice of it, allowing herself to be easily distracted by many things...foolish.<br />
<br />
Not long after, she had gone on a pilgrimage of sorts. Her travels in her quest for knowledge took her from the Church halls for quite a long time. When she had returned, much change had occured in the ranks of the Church. One of those changes being that he had in fact left the Church to seek his path. Much time passed before she saw him again and what she discovered suprised her. He had become but a shadow of himself. His presence no longer bore an air of authority...he seemed confused and lost, his path uncertain. The two spoke briefly that day, but arranged a meeting to discuss this current state and for counsel.<br />
<br />
The meeting came and she gained much insight. Although he had no intention at that time of rejoining the Church, she agreed to guide him spiritually to the best of her ability, to restore his Hate and reclaim his path. She could not deny the strange spark she felt when he informed her that he had been seeking her out. The two met a number of times after that. A few months later, the depth of his Hate was becoming ever more apparent, his aura returning and she was being stricken with awe by him. His power at that time was far greater than her own experience. She finally revealed her feelings of awe and command to him at one of their many meetings and he had simply taken her hand in his, his face like a mask as always...expresionless. He drew her hand to his lips and kissed it softly. She felt a rush of heat spread through her and was certain she was blushing. She quietly excused herself making up a story about some duties for an event with the Church soon to take place.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a week later he had come looking for her and requested a meeting. She agreed for the next eve. During that meeting he had made known to her his desire to walk his path in Hate with her at his side always. She could not answer him. She looked into his eyes and the two sat there for long moments in deep connection to one another's soul. Then she nodded slowly, she would be his bound.<br />
<br />
He left then. A few days passed before he returned again and she had questions now that she had time to think. She made it very clear to him that her path lay with the Church and she would not waver from that until her death, when and if it came. he told her that he understood this, but he would still not be returning. They continued to discuss the situation at great length until it was worked out and understood by both. So, they resumed their meeting which had begun it all. She continued to fortify his faith in Hate and he continued to court her. He ended the meetings with a deep kiss that burned with passion, setting her blood on fire and her senses tingling.<br />
<br />
Many weeks passed during which nothing changed. The relationship itself seemed to stale some. Although his Hate had deepened and he was nearly as he was when first they ever met, his decision to still remain away from the Church had begun to trouble her. The time eventually came when she had decided that it was best for her to remain to her true path and serve the purpose she was intended to serve, alone. She revealed this to himand he accepted her decision with regret, but with little that he could say to change her mind. Their meetings ceased and he again disappeared. Months passed and she longed for his touch, to taste his lips upon hers. Still she did not see him. The crystal the two had shared was quiet and empty.<br />
<br />
After a seeming eternity, she was contacted by yet another of the V'Ruuktaal house, the brother of her once mate to be. He had decided to return to the flock and sought her assistance in such. After much consideration she agreed to the task and began to inform him of her requirements for his return to the congregation. It would not be easy, all her initiates could attest to that. There was always much study and difficult feats to perform in the Father's name, but those who were true always succeeded. His tasks were difficult and involved, she set to test him fully. It took some time, but he did in fact succeed and admission to the Church was granted.<br />
<br />
It was not but a few short months later that the inexplicable occured. Her lover returned without so much as a word to her and went about his own way and reentered the Church as well. She was astounded by this development. He has been so certain his path lay elsewhere. Well, she questioned him of course and although he answered her always, she never truly understood his reasoning. She could only accept it and assume the father had his own reasons and that is was His Will to send him back to the Church..and inevitably to her. It was not long before was stricken by him once more and found herself back in his arms once more. He began to smile again. She had not seen him smile for years...since they first ever met. She felt good with him, perhaps because she was needed in a different way than her official standing in the Church. He pursued her again, asked her again to be his bound and she was unable to deny him. Blinded by anything more than hopes and lust, the season turned and they were bound.</i><br />
<br />
A faint smile crosses her lips.<br />
<br />
<i>The beginning had been bliss. How she had anticipated his return from the hunt every eve. Having long prepared with hot scented baths and silky sheer adornments. Such a passion and heat passed between them that little else mattered when the eve came to a close. Skin upon skin, the slight sheen of well earned perspiration glistening in the firelight and soft moans amid giggles drifting from the chambers. Pleasurable days and nights spent in one another's embrace, but it was short lived.<br />
<br />
Only brief was their time before the call of travel for research and the quest for knowledge returned and lured Vaeadil away. He left on many a pilgrimage alone to satisfy his needs for spreading Hatred and seeking whatever it was he seemed to need. Meanwhile she had remained with the Church...always the Church. Ever training and gaining her knowledge there. Long late nights alone gave way to lonely days as well. The Church was ever there with it's needs and her duties to tend, but in this she still felt empty. Soon the chambers within the V'Ruuktaal estate she shared with him had become a mess of dusty tomes and scrolls scattered all about the floor and covering the desk upon the far wall. She became aggitated with the servants who came to clean or bring her food. She simply would not be bothered. She immersed herself in her studies and did little else. Her attentions thusly absorbed, time passed quickly and little notice was made of it. At long last however, she could bear it no longer. She ordered the tomes returned to the library and many other locations she had borrowed them from and prepared her own work to be stored until such time as she would return to it.<br />
<br />
Faeryln then began to train...long and hard and often without rest, almost to the point of exhaustion. Her studies now forgotten and chambers neglected. She rarely returned to the estate or evern the Church anymore. She had no concept of the time that passed, only the hunt, months fled her memory, but she grew in power. Her appearance was much more frail than she actually was. A somewhat hauntingly gaunt face remained where once had been a radiant if not wicked grin filled with amusement at the antics of others. Gone were the smiles, joy and even notice of anything. In this state she had finally returned to those chambers. Filthy worn field armor cast carelessly into a corner. Servants were immediately summoned to bring food and prepare a proper bath. The realization of her self neglect was upon her and it was unacceptable, both to her station and to herself as well. </i></font></p>
