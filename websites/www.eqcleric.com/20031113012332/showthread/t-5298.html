<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I had such fun last night, I just had to share :)<br />
<br />
First let me say that I dont normally go for pick up groups, never have...even on my Ranger, Id rather go to a less exp solo zone, than you join a pickup group.<br />
<br />
But last night I took the plunge. Myself and a 48 Enchanter friend of mine, went to Plane of Tranquility and /ooc 48 Cleric and 48 Enchanter looking to join a group.<br />
<br />
Well, we got a tell from a Paladin saying that he is making a group for Plane of Disease.<br />
Hmm, thinks I...could be tough, but lets try it...after all the worst that can happen is we all die, hehe.<br />
<br />
So we join the group, the pally and shaman are both 55+ and we are soon joined by a wizard and Warrior...also both 55+<br />
Hehe, then there is me and my 48 Enchanter friend :)<br />
<br />
We go into PoD and set up to the left side of the courtyard...This is my first time in the Planes (my ranger had been in PoJ once, but thats it).<br />
I am being extremely careful with heals and all is going well. When suddenly the Palladin (he was pulling) calls that he has 3 on him...."Dammit!" I thought, this could be tough and I am spamming HoT trying to get in early - but he is OOR...then suddenly the Palladin calls "No heals, Im just going to die here"...and he does...."WOW!" I thought "well done my man".<br />
<br />
I res, we all get set up again and start again. Eventually I get comfortable healing and we have less downtime and all is smooth as silk. These guys are fair with loot (well, hehe, the two partchments that dropped anyway). The pulls are good, each class knows what to do...it was very smooth and really well executed.<br />
<br />
I had a blast, both the enchanter and I made over 2 yellows of exp and we met some really nice and talented players.<br />
<br />
Eventually (after about 2 and half hours) Enchanter and I had to leave, but replacements were found.<br />
We said our goodbyes and then the tank thanks me in group say for healing well....I puffed out my chest with pride... To know that I at 48 can hold my own in a high zone, with high players, who all knew their stuff.<br />
<br />
Well, it was a blast and I wanted to pass it on. I guess it wont mean much to you all. Except maybe, dont be turned off trying something tough, it could be really rewarding.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">No, the enchanter couldnt mez at all. But if we did get an add we split them up and each mellee took one. Id use HoT and CH with the shaman throwing in spot heals if needed (rarely was). All in all we did well, if we got an add, it got pretty mana intensive for me, but a mod rod help to keep us going with barely a break.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just to add to that. The enchanter mez at 48 would only work on mobs level 55 or lower. I think she was saying at 49 she gets a new mez which should work for 55+. So at 49 she should be ok, then it will just be a case of mobs resisting a low level players spells. Although we did find that those underbulk things didnt resist many spells. I dont think my clicky snare was resisted once (although it did wear off quickly at times - or seemed to at least). At one stage I was even nuking them with Retribution for full damage (yeah it was near the end and I had mana to spare :) )</td>

I, too, started in the planes in my high 40's, and did fine in PoJ, PoN and PoD. Our mana pools at that level of course can be a problem,  but with a well-equipment MT it's not too bad. Just watch out for those groups that have a low-level MT (below 55 or so)...they are hell !!!</td>

Surprisingly, I was able to keep up with heals without any problem. The only one to die was me and that was due to doing a CH a bit too close to the paladins and caught aggro. I'm looking forward to seeing more of the Planes. 2 blue ticks per kill is certainly nice.<br />

PoN = Average drops.  Lots of dark powers pages from trees there for quest cloak.  Exp very good.<br />
<br />
PoD = Parchemant drops.  That's about it except for some quest drops, but exp is the best.<br />
<br />
PoI = Great drops.  Not money, but all that vendor junk is tradeskill stuff for Tinkers.  You can clean up in the Bazaar with those drops.  Also some really good armor upgrades for you level will drop there as well off random yard trash mobs.  Sometimes you get pages for quest cloak.  Always check the Bazaar before you sell the vendor loot...  You may be VERY suprised!  :D  Exp can be quite good here, especially if you can get into a good fast pulling group.  I'm a huge PoI fan.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">PoI rocks...was there just last night for about four hours and picked up 40%xp.  And got some kind of hat that I can't wear but I can sell.  The only problem with this plane is that without a good tank and a real good slower...(and maybe a quick cheal finger).  It can get bad quick.  And since everyone hangs out at the zone out...(usually two groups) when one group runs into trouble they usually zone or die that leaves the other group very vulnerable especially when already engaged.  A good Chanter is almost a must...things go so much better.  <br />
<br />
Our group last night during the peek xp was:  55 War, 49 Druid, 56 Chanter, 54 Shammie, 57 Monk, and 52 Cleric<br />
<br />
We went on for awhile just kickin the crud out of everyone.  Only one death all night and that was a weird thing...other group had a mob...and it just up and made a beline for our chanter.  The chanter didn't last long (do they ever?).  Don't know why the mob came after our chanter when it was engaged with the other group.  Strange...<br />
<br />
Group finally fell apart after the other group wiped and left us with leftovers...we were forced to zone.  Was a wonderful night there.  Very rewarding.  But for every night I have like this in PoI I have three nights where we are runnin for our lives all night and they xp seems to go backwards.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I've always enjoyed going to PoI and not just for the decent xp. The atmosphere alone makes me want to come back for more. I agree that those entrance groups can be a bugger if the other group pulls too many then zones. However sometimes I have found the groups work with each other which makes for a good time. Venturing out further into the zone is fun as well and does get you away from the occasional crowd at the zone in. It's wise to bring some decent muscle with you if you do this.<br />

One thing about all planes - when I see the message "%t is slowed!" I'm happy.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Yup, great pull spot if you want to get away from the GY crowd is the ramp tot he Factory.  Just remember the 2 Tin Soldiers at the top cannot be mezzed or single pulled, although they can be rooted...  They have a very long (30 min I think.) repop rate, so you can do them singley after you intially kill them.  Just keep an eye on the clock when pulling mobs to the ramp.  Don't want to be fully engaged when the Tin Soldiers pop again.  If you have a strong enough group, and someone is keyed for it, you can hit the Factory too.  That is one fun subzone I must say.  Exp is crazy good in there!</td>

Being a DEF you can get this easily and it wont cost you a cent (oops CP I mean)<br />

The snare on it isnt very good and does not last long. But it helps and has turned the tide for me a couple of times (if trouble hits - fear, stun, then snare).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice on PoI. We (enchanter and I) are still a little low and cannot always get groups there, but when we do we show them that our level is no problem :)<br />
I may try to make the ramp next time I can put a group together there.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Funny thing is, if nobody can snare in the group this item suddenly becomes an essential part. The 30% snare is a whole lot better than rooting the fleeing mob where someone will continue to take damage. And if there are other mobs in the area that will aggro when the current target flees, that's just asking for trouble. If you don't already have it, get it! You just have to make sure health will be ok near the end of the fight and snare early so you're not too late. Then just recast to make sure the snare stays fresh. It's funny to see the looks on the faces of the other group members "who the heck is casting darkness?!?".</td>

I agree with that 1000%. A couple months back I was screwing around with some friends in the top guild on my server and we went to PoI and instead of "doing what everyone else does", they went down the left path from ZI and started clearing their way through. This worked out great as it gets you away from the ZI/ZO crowd and if the DPS is high enough the exp just flies. Every time I've been back to PoI I've suggested this method to my group.  If your DPS is lacking be very careful because the fast respawn will cause the mobs behind ya to come and bite ya in your arse. It also helps to have a Druid or Wizzie in grp to port you out when you are done, otherwise plan ahead and give yourself time to fight your way back out.</td>
