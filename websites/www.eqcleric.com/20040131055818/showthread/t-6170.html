Certainly since SOE has taken over, the name rules have become more loose. Back when Verant was the sole owner of EQ the name rules were strictly enforced and remained that way for a few years. It was during the POP expansion that the rule was allowed to slide away unless a name was offensive. So I understand your sentiment, but I still enjoy some of the names that fly by me while sitting in POK doing whatever.<br />
<br />
Keep them coming guys, I'm enjoying the names so far!</td>

As with most everything in life, laws and rules are open to interpretation. By that each Lead GM had his/her own ideas about names and either was more strict about each rule or not. I can only speak of the Karana server during the Original release and know beyond a shadow of a doubt "Most" names non-roleplay were changed ASAP. I can't remember which expansion it was, but during velious or Luclin, Karana's Lead GM was promoted and we got a new Lead. Our current GM seems to be fairly reasonable and also appears to be more relaxed on certain issues, names being on them.<br />
<br />
I certainly didn't mean for this post to get robbed into a discussion of, is it bad or good. I was only wanting to laugh at some of the names floating around.<br />
<br />
So can we go back to posting the names? :p</td>

Well, since Ive been invited ;) hehe<br />
Those who dont know my story, here goes. I had named my character Savyrass. I created him about 12 months or more ago and then let him sit for ages as I had other stuff to do. Eventually I got back to him and levelled him up, during that time I petitioned for and got a GM to give him his last name Whe'Nimgudnredy (exactly like that, which is why a GM had to do it).<br />
<br />
So, when poor old Savyrass Whe'Nimgudnredy got to his 52 (and 2AA) birthday, he suddenly logged in one day to find his name changed to Savyra.<br />
Apparently (according to a GM that would listen to nothing but his/her own voice) it was an extremely offensive name (*boggle*).<br />
I have been in the guide program myself and for this reason I know that if I had been level 55, my name would not have been changed. Its still a source of annoyance for me.<br />
I did half expect my name to be changed at the beginning, but once my surname was approved and implemented by a GM I figured it was considered ok. Then to change it at the last minute, bloody annoying.<br />
<br />
I dont care what your name is, as long as its not obviously offensive or crude, then who cares.<br />
Have I seen any funny ones lately? Nope....maybe Pistasa, dont think he has a last name yet though :)</td>

I saw a player with that same *exact* name (and a cleric to boot... hmmm) on another server that I'm regularly on. A Guildie told me he saw someone /petition it, saying it sounded too close to  "Sav-Your-A$$" so it was changed. At least, I assume that one was changed, like yours was.<br />

Kayanaa, that is EXACTLY what its meant to mean. Now I dont know much about you Americans, but there are two points I had about this name (and like I said, the GM wouldnt listen, in fact he told me if I keep talking to him he would not help me at all - I was trying to get my name better, savra sounded dumb).<br />
Two points:<br />
Ass, here in Australia, is not offensive. In fact its another word for a donkey. Now I know I didnt use it in that context, but hey, if we are going to split hairs.... In fact I think if I had used Arse instead, I would have been alright.<br />
Second, what in gods name is wrong with saying "save your arse"?? Wake up people, you are playing a game in which almost every second of your online time you are either looking to kill, killing, or getting ready to kill some poor unfortunate creature that just happens to be wandering along. This game is not for 12 year olds and even my son is allowed to say arse in the right context. How is it possibly offensive for me to tell you that I will save your arse?</td>

My first character, a female monk, was named Ahliana Ochsanfree.  I hadn't intended it and only thought of the lastname when it became available.  It suited her.<br />
<br />
My Froglok Cleric is named Neehai Grasshopper.<br />
<br />
I also have a female Ogre warrior named Gorges Ravine.<br />
<br />
Another name I love and wish was available.  Chaste Daly.</td>
