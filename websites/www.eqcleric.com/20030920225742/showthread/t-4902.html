<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">So here I am sitting in Sol A camping Lord Gimblox. I get this tell from a guy:<br />
<br />
"can you rez me at the zone in from Lava?"<br />
<br />
So I reply, "I am camping Lord Gimblox and alone at the moment. Don't wanna lose my camp"<br />
<br />
He replies: "Please, I lost my level"<br />
<br />
So I do a /who all "dumba$$" and see he is only level 18. Being the nice guy that I wish I wasn't, I run to zone and hit rez and run back. I don't even wait for him to zone in from the rez.<br />
<br />
I then get a tell, "can you rez my friend too?"<br />
<br />
I answer "No, your lucky I rezzed you"<br />
<br />
Few minutes pass and I get tell from "Dumba$$ #2"<br />
<br />
"could you rez me at the zone in please?"<br />
<br />
I reply "sorry I can't."<br />
<br />
Reply back to me "Why?"<br />
<br />
I reply "because I can't afford to lose my camp"<br />
<br />
So this goes on for a while. I quit answering and considered placing him on ignore. But didn't really want to miss how far this idiot would go so I didn't.<br />
<br />
Then All of a sudden I see the magic floating corpse bounce in front of me. I get a tell from "Dumba$$ #2" could you rez me now please?"<br />
<br />
Well since he said please: I rezzed him.<br />
<br />
5 minutes later I get another tell from "Dumba$$ #1" if I could run to SolB zone and rez him and his friend! I ended up getting spammed for 4 different deaths from these idjuts!<br />
<br />
Finally I had, had enough. I replied "Look man. I never got my first rez (on my necro) until I was in my 40's and I only got that one then because I had lost a level. I did you the same courtesy by restoring your level the first time even though you are only level 19. I am camping an epic piece and will not, nor cannot run all over norrath rezzing people who lost maybe 10 minutes worth of XP! so to answer your question, NO I WILL NOT REZ YOU!"<br />
<br />
Ok so maybe I sound like an ass. But I got ask to rez them for 4 different deaths. I explained to them the first time that I couldn't afford to lose my camp. I also went ahead and rezzed them the first time for the mere fact that the guy lost his level.<br />
<br />
Plus, add in the fact that at those levels you don't lose much time to a death. I am gonna make a new policy for rezzing: I will not rez you unless your at least level 30+ then only if it doesn't cause me too much trouble!<br />
<br />
Why do people think they "NEED" a rez when they are at that level? Suck it up people GEEZ!<br />
<br />
I thought I would feel better if I wrote this, but I don't! /rolleyes</td>

It's times like these that /a or /ignore are your friends:) It really bugs me if I'm in a group and someone is begging for a res. They usually get something back from me like "look I'm trying to keep my group alive, I don't have the mana to give you a res. If I was just passing by that would be another story..." then I would go anonymous to prevent others from asking.<br />

They think they are "entitled" to whatever service you provide, and that you are obligated to do this.  It is is all about them, as the saying goes.<br />
<br />
They have no respect for anything outside of themselves, and it always shows in how they react to your first response.<br />
<br />
Part of this <b>could</b> be curbed by those who are introducing them to the game.  Think about it...most of the new players are joining because of friends that are already playing.  Often, their initial attitudes about various things in EQ will be a reflection of the friend that got them started.  I think we can help this by not only showing any friends the mechanics of the game, but also give them a primer on acceptable and unacceptable behaviors in Norrath.</font></td>

But geez, some of you guys are Nazis! I'll rez anyone if they can bring thier corpse to me without training my group, but I guess clicky-rez has a lot to do with that. PoP made things much worse on us though "C'mon man, it's only 1 zone away from a book!"</td>

-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok so yesterday Im EXPing and in the middle of a mob this rogue comes dragging 2 corpses and asks for a rez. Like I said we were in the middle of taking a mob down and had two mezzed on stand by when out of no where we got another mob in camp. Keep in mind that we were at WC and its pretty safe in terms of random adds unlike EC. <br />
<br />
The following conversation resulted:<br />

Nubanus tells you, 'think gubar and tara could get a click when u get a chance please?'<br />

<br />
She was in PoK, getting ready to log and got a tell from Monk_Lizard_01 asking if she could help with a CR by porting him and a cleric to IC.<br />
She thought sure why not, shouldnt take long and ran to nexus stone where the monk was waiting. The monk proceeded to tell her that he is just trying to find a cleric.<br />
Ok so she thought she would give him 5 mins then log.<br />
Luckily the monk found a cleric so she ported them out. Get to the zone and both monk and cleric take off at high speed, to complete the CR. My friend waited a min or two, got no thanks or anything, not a word. So she decided to go back to PoK and log.<br />
She zones into PoK and there is a tell waiting for her from the monk asking if she could take them to back to PoK. <br />
She is a kind soul and felt bad for leaving them without telling them so she heads back to IC. She tells them she is at the portal if they want to go back and they told her they are killing and could they come to her (I think they were killing a turtle or something - she said they were all Barons and the like).<br />
So she ran to the spot they said and waited...and waited...and waited. Apparently it took forever to kill the turtle. They kept telling her they are almost finished.<br />
Finally they killed it, she ported them back to PoK and they disbanded the group as soon as they touched the ground and left with not a word (again), no thanks..nothing.<br />
<br />
Some people are just rude. Oh and she wont tell me who it was as she knows I would have something to say to them, hehe.</td>

I have gotten a few tells from people asking for rezzes while i was exping, does not happen often, but it has.  I normally reply with, in a few minutes, kind of busy at the moment.  I then check with my group, make sure they know what is up, and when we get to a point where i can run out and rez em, i will, but only if they are in the same zone.  Sometimes I ask for donations, sometimes i don't depends on how my stack of gems is doing hehe.<br />
<br />
My druid on the other hand has gotten the "Never had to donate for a port before" when asked to port.  One guy told me that he never had to donate for a translocate, why should he donate for a port? I then explained the difference in the two spells to him... not sure if he got it.<br />
<br />
Couple of nights ago I had my druid on, was doing some pottery so was in PoK, ran into a friend of mine, stopped by to say "hi", and this guy walks up and says "can i get a port to sfg?"<br />

i looked around, yup, i am still in PoK... <br />
<br />
"Why not take the book to Qeynos?"<br />
"Cause I am lazy I guess, lol"<br />
"Nope, not gonna port ya, have a nice run"<br />

Another druid was standing there, said "Don't even think about it"<br />
"Hail, Druid_02"<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
some people i swear...<br />
<br />
Maybe I am old fashioned, but I always donated for a rez/port when i was younger or playing an alt.<br />
<br />
I got a tell from a guy one time asking me to port him from WC to the Nexus, I was in SRO at the time, on my way to Guk.  Told him, sure, for 50pp i would do it.  He then told me it was a little steep, I then explained to him that I was busy, he was in another zone, and that if he did not want to pay it, he could walk, not my problem, i was not advertising that i was porting, he sent me a tell...<br />
<br />
i think i still have him on /ignore from the response he gave me<br />

<br />
Many moons back when I couldn't find a group, I used to solo in Dawnshroud Peaks.  I would find a quiet 3-mushroom spawn spot and park myself there, content to solo those three mobs and med in peace.  <br />
<br />
One night, I was soloing at the 3 spawn near the big house, minding my own business when along comes a bard by the name of Anthem.  He stops, looks at me, and then proceeds to pull a mushroom from my little camp.  I sent him a nice tell asking if he could please leave those three for me, I even offered to buff him.  The response I got was exactly this : "There are plenty to pull in the house".  I proceeded to explain to him that since I am a cleric with no SOW and no invis, pulling from that house is very risky, especially since there are spawn triggers on the ground all around it, and I ask him nicely once again if he can leave the 3-spawn alone and allow me the luxury of staying there.  Then he gets REALLY nasty, telling me I can't tell him what to do and how hard it is for him to find "blues" in Dawnshroud.  I figure to heck with it and move to another 3 spawn and leave him there.  THE SUCKER FOLLOWS ME AND KEEPS SENDING ME TELLS!!  Threatning to pull mobs from wherever I go because "I am not allowed to tell him what to do" despite me asking him in the nicest way possible to allow me to hold one camp.  Then, to add insult to injury, the SOB begins to train shrooms on top of me and laughing about it.<br />
<br />
Fast foreward to a month ago.  Me and my druid GF sitting on a boat in Dulak.  Oddly, we were the only people there besides 1 shaman at the zoneline soloing.  We are cleaning up shop when I get a tell from some random guy I don't know asking if I can rez a friend of his at Tog zone in Nadox.  Since we were getting ready to leave I figured I'd just jump in, have the druid succor me to Tog zone area for rez.  I tell the guy to have his friend give me a tell and I'll keep him posted as to my ETA.  Sure enough, Anthem gives me a tell.  HA!!!  Bastard!!  I refuse to rez him.  Told him exactly what I thought of him and his antics.  Royally peeved the guy off too haha he berates the hell out of me in tells, totally fuming raving mad that I refused to help him.  You couldn't wipe the smile off my face with turpentine that night :D <br />
