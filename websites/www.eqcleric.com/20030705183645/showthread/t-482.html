<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">A Few tricks I do and have done ( before I got the horse ):<br />
<br />
Try and drop a heal on the tank before he runs out to grab another Mob.  That way he/she can *hopefully* get enough agro so the mob won't be so mad at you when you do have to complete heal him/her.<br />
<br />
Another tip, Stand, Stand, Stand.  Stand for a good minute after you complete heal.  That way they can grab agro and keep it easier.<br />
<br />
Buy a horse.  When you get the money, a horse is a GREAT agro controller since you are technically standing all the time.<br />
<br />
However, no matter what you do, you sometimes get agro.  ( Like in DL, those dumb dogs agro all the time ).  Just keep all your buffs up and on you, and hope they take it off you before you die :)<br />
<br />
*edit*  I thought of something else I do but I don't know if it helps or not.  I just do it :P  Try and stand max range from the tank then complete heal. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</td>

<br />
If that doesn't work, it might just be a case that the tank isn't using his /taunt button properly yet. <br />
<br />
In addition to making sure you have your buffs up, make sure you have the divine line up in the spell gems too. Don't hesitate to cast Divine Barrier or Divine Aura on yourself if you get any aggro (yes, make sure both are up if you have them), as it's never a waste to keep yourself a live. Perhaps better yet, you might want to attempt to root the mobs (although that could get messy if they resist).</td>

He'll usually run back to the tank as soon as you stand; at least, that's been my experience.  It can actually be kind of humorous to sit and stand over and over just to see 'em run back and forth; this could prolly irritate people in your group though.  <br />

I agree that a Horse/Lizard is a Must. Which you get is totally your ppreference. But personnally i would perfer the Lizard for targeting purposes the Horse head gets in the way of targeting.<br />
<br />
As for the Rooting, Don't do it. This is the last thing you want to use as aggro control as a Getto mez or solo tactict it is nice or save me I am dieing aggro control mabey  but as a rule Do not use it for aggro management it does more harm than good because the mob hits what ever is closest. You spend more time and Mana healing those that get to close than healing the MA. <br />
<br />
When you get into mobs that heal themselves alot of the time the cleric becomes the main interupter. You chain stun at the end of the fight to avoid com heals. Seb Crypt was a good place for that /rolleyes</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Oh I definitely agree - DO NOT ROOT.<br />
<br />
Not only does it manage to make the main tank mad, you end up working LOTS more.<br />
<br />
Like the poster above said, root makes the agro bounce from who had the agro to whoever (whomever?) is the closest.  Now, many meleers do not understand or even realize that the mob is rooted and do not move according such as the main tank move in close and the others go to max melee range.  So, what you have happen is all melees getting agro and you having to heal EVERYONE instead of just the main tank.<br />
<br />
Healing everyone vs main tank is just not efficient.  Uses more mana which in turn is more downtime waiting for cleric to med.  In some instances it can cause death because of some melees getting hurt all at the same time brings the question to mind - which one do I heal first?</td>

<br />
Root definately sucks at the higher levels, hell I don't even know if I could successfully get it off and not resisted while a mob was beating on me these days; however, I remember being quite effective in using root at lower levels, all the way up to my short time in DL. If someone didn't know what to do when a mob was rooted, I'd just explain to them after the battle. <br />
<br />
As far as what do you do when multiple peeps are getting swatted and are dying? I spam group heal, which typically gets the mob onto me, and then I hit my Divine Barrier/Aura, which in turn gives the tank enough time to gather aggro on all mobs. I click it off after a few ticks, and then the group is back to "normal."</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Hum.. I still keep root up, because even on my horsey, its easy to get aggro when you have to do some serious fast healing. While the higher level para seems to get interupted more, its not as resisted, and i usually just hop out of the way. Unless you're fighting more than one mob at a time, the tank will be following the monster to you - If the monster is rooted, the tank is on the monster, and the monster isnt on you, which is why i move out of the way =) We can withstand a few hits for the sake of crowd control, but i feel that most people are aware of how root aggro works by the time they are level 30 or so (Though i didnt figure it out until i was 40ish, on a ranger, no less) And im happy to explain it to someone quickly if they dont know. What i find with rooting is that it lets me control the situation easily, and know whats going on. If i know the mob is rooted, i know its not coming for me, and that the tank should be wailing on it, the shammy/chanter can slow without getting smacked as well, if he hasnt already. <br />
<br />
Its also a lifesaver when there are adds. Generally, in a planes group, if its more than 3, i figure ill be zoning one way or another (Naked, or fully dressed, my pick:D  ) but 1 or 2 adds can be handled simply by rooting them as they begin to agro you, then hiding behind the tank =P</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">I fully agree with root being used for crowd control purposes.  I always have root up to help control.  However, I do not use it to help control agro from healing.  When there is one mob in camp, root is a bad thing. <br />
<br />
For heal agro, I stand by my belief and think root is a very bad thing. <br />
<br />
BUT, keep it up still.  You can get an add that no one notices or no chanter/bard in group or even death to one of these classes.  Root is good in all these cases. <br />
<br />
At higher levels I do not find myself getting resisted much.  I find it getting interupted and when I finally DO land root - it breaks quick *alot*<br />
<br />
I assume the original poster is in his 40s by the fact he did mention the horrible dogs in DL.  At that point I would start learning agro control through different means rather than root to prepare you for when you start getting higher levels and start playing in the planes.  <br />
<br />
Root is still your friend.  Just use your clerical instincts to determine when to use it.<br />

The bottom line is every point you heal with a standard heal is aggro. Elixirs are technically buffs and not heals, so they generate a lot less, as does healing with an HP buff. CH has a slight aggro reduction effect, so a CH for 4k is not 4k aggro, but it's still pretty bad. (Donal's BP effect does not have this effect.)<br />
<br />
Proximity sometimes matters for heals, sometimes doesn't. Depends a lot where you are. Verant likes to keep people on their toes by tweaking the rules a little from zone to zone. But keep your distance so, as someone else pointed out, you can stand up again before the mob actually hits you.<br />
<br />
Agreed on keeping tank's health up before the pull. When the mob is running is a good time to sneak in a heal to reasonably top them off. (Don't be fanatical about 100%) If you play in the later game, try to land one when mob enrages if you can time that. Tank hopefully won't take much damage after that, and if they do it's quite likely because they forgot to turn attack off. Kills two birds with one stone.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ok, for those younger ones out there (like me) who don't have complete heal, I'll pass on what I understand. It's basic, but hopefully it will help.<br />
<br />
<i>Don't heal too early.</i> Many young clerics that I've seen start healing the moment the tank gets below 4 bulbs of health. This is too early. The tank hasn't built up sufficient aggro by then to keep the mob in his face. As a general rule, don't heal a tank before he's 50%. This goes for all lower level groups. I don't know about high-level groups, because I haven't got there yet.<br />
<br />
<i>Know the percent of HP healed on your tank</i>--for all your party members for that matter--for each of your heals. By the time you have greater heal (level 24) a tank should have about 1000 to 1200 HP. Your GHs will heal roughly 25% of his/her HP. A regular Heal will restore about 1/2 a bulb. Keep this in mind when healing for a couple of reasons. Obviously mana conservation is one, the other is that it keeps aggro down. I for instance, do not try to restore a tank to full health during a fight. I usually hit him every time he gets to 50%. This will bring him back up to about 75%--a comfortable range in my opinion. It also keeps me from gaining aggro by popping him twice in a row. I have found that by doing it this way, I don't gain aggro by sitting down. I usually either get it right away or not at all. If you are worried, then by all means, let a tank hit the mob 2 or 3 times before sitting. Just don't forget to sit.<br />
<br />
<i>Top him off between rounds.</i> As has been stated previously, top off the tank between pulls. If the tank is not on a mob, then there's no hate list for you to worry about.<br />
<br />
<i>Create a "help" macro.</i> This sounds narcissistic and corny, but create a macro to let the group know you are being attacked. While this isn't a specific aggro reducing technique, I've never met a cleric who hasn't caught aggro. (If you are one that hasn't, please let me know how it's done).<br />
<br />
In the heat of battle (especially with multiple mobs) sometimes you can be attacked without anyone noticing it. You may feel you're screaming like a little girl, but hey, if the cleric bites it, there goes heals and resurrections. Basically, there's a good chance the entire party wipes with you down, and you aren't even there to rez the group. This forces more down time and can even lead to a group break up as frustrations rise while everyone is attempting to get back to the group, etc. My macro is a simple "MOB ON ME!" I've toyed with using "%t ON the CLERIC" and other such examples, but found that the target more often than not is a party members (tanks) name. The thought was to alert the group as to WHICH mob is on me during a multi-mob fight, but to be honest, it's not the easiest to target a mob before hitting the macro. The extra hit or two you take may mean the difference between healing another day and meeting Brell in person.<br />
<br />
If anyone finds fault with these general guidelines, please speak up. I am always looking for a better way to do something.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">Ah, the help key. I used to have one of those at the lower levels, and more than once I received a /tell about scaring the heck out of someone. During that level, what I also used to do in the help macro was to put a /y in there too--reason being is that gave peeps an idea of where I was.<br />
<br />
Today, of course, I don't use a help key. There are a handful of reasons for this:<br />
<br />
1) Group members are a little bit more comfortable with their characters<br />
<br />
2) I rarely gain aggro<br />
<br />
Still, and I know I sound like a broken record here, I feel as if I need to restate the importance of using the Divine line to save your skin. I suppose that serves as a help macro for me, as mine is set up as follows<br />
<br />
<br />
/cast 3<br />
/cast 4<br />
/gsay DIVINE BARRIER on Galvatist! I will be out of action for about 18 seconds.<br />
<br />
Two parts I want to explain. First, I have it set up to cast in both spell slots just in case I've already used one of my Divine spells. Second, the 18 second thing is a little inaccurate as I click off the spell before it naturally wears off. Heck, I'm not even sure if 18 seconds is correct; is it?</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">At 52, my healing stratagy has changed modestly from early levels.  For one, I very rarely root any longer.  As was stated before, players are much more proficent with their characters and CC is usually handeled very well.  I have died more from trains than Adds or heal agro.  Thinking about it, I don't remember the last time I died from heal agro.  Anyway, I only use root anymore when another caster has agro, that gives them a chance to get away and me a chance to heal them.  Always have at least one of the divine spells up, countless saves because of it.  And I ALWAYS have gate memed. (Note, I also always bind outside the zone it for quick return.)  If your gpr is dropping faster than you can get a heal off, then gate is probably your only option.  It never hurts to have a stun or DD memed for those long fights or when the mob is CHing itself.  Can do wonders for the speed of a kill.<br />
<br />
Once you do have CH, you MUST learn how to time your cast for efficient mana use.  One important thing to remember when CHing, keep in account for those mobs that enrage or beserk.  Health drops DAMN quick and if you are timing your CH to the line, then you can consider your MT dead.<br />
<br />
Regarding when to heal, if you are topping off a caster or someone who took agro for a min or so, wait to do this till the mob is down a yellow.  I have found this to generally be a safe time to start healing and not worry about getting heal aggro.<br />
<br />
I do have a question about timing for healing the MA.  What methods or tacktics do you use for healing the MA when you are forced to focus on the MT?  Do you wait till fight over?  This is something that I am still experimenting with.  <br />
<br />
One last time, always keep your Armour of Faith buff going.  10% spell casting haste can make the difference.  I personally, always keep it on myself and the CC/slower of the grp.  The faster the cleric and the crowd control can get their spells off, the better.<br />
<br />
If anyone has some better ideas or suggestions for how to improve on these, please let me know.  I am always open to possible improvments.</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">52 Cleric here also...<br />
<br />
When concentrating on MA healing mainly (which hopefully we do most of the time...can you say aggro control?) I typically start with a heal-over-time...keeps tank alive while slower is trying to slow. Also, this leaves me available to quick-heal the slower if he gets beat on too much. Then I focus on timing my complete-heals, usually casting around 50 to 40% health. I do not sit until 15-30 seconds after the CH, if the tanks HPs are not dropping too fast.<br />
<br />
Regarding the heals at the end of the fight, I keep the mob targetted to monitor its HPs, then try to time the final CH or a smaller heal so it lands right when the mob dies. This lets the tank go pull another mob right away (if he's also puller), or if he's not the puller, he is still ready to taunt the newly arriving mob as soon as it gets there. I rarely if ever get heal aggro doing this...my main heal aggro happens when the non-MA gets aggro, and I have to patch-heal them...generates hate pretty fast.<br />
<br />
If I do get aggro, I stand still to let the tank pull it off me. If I get too low in HPs, I DA.<br />
<br />
This is my typical play style...</td>

<td bgcolor="#4D4D73">My god, don't listen to these people who don't keep root memmed.  Root is an excellent tool for aggro control, since while the critter is rooted, we know precisely who it will attack.  Once you're rooting, the main tank steps forward, everyone else steps back, and hey presto, one perfectly-controlled monster, ready to be slowed, debuffed, and then converted to xp.<br />
<br />
If your melees do not know this, explain it to them, because as melees they do need to understand about root.<br />
<br />
If you're having trouble with gaining unnecessary aggro, root the critter and step back.  If you're having trouble channelling the root, then stun it before rooting.<br />
<br />
Tip: If you want your enchanter to fall in love with you, root critters which are mezzed just before your tank breaks mezz.<br />
<br />
Further tip:  At higher levels, you have access to two root lines:  the `immobilize` line and the `paralyzing earth` line.  The `immobilize` line is fast-cast and low-resist; the `paralyzing earth` line holds for rather a lot longer.  But there's a lot to be said for your old level 5 root spell... it casts amazingly fast and it's easy to channel.<br />
<br />
At level 65 I regularly use root in experience groups, and I even have it memmed on many raids.</td>
