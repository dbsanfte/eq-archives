<br>
i submit that your backstab crit can never be less then 212 for a 60 rogue .  that right there should scream a theory at you.   that a crit is 212/120 % of the hit it would have otherwise been.  a crit.  NOT AVERAGE.  we're being more emphatic then &quot;average&quot;.  A CRIT (period) is 177% of the damage the hit would have otherwise done.  the variance will be statistical variance in the selection of hits that were crit'd not in the formula itself.<br>
<br>
in my logs for the 5682 mainhand hits the average damage was 48.  the average of the  117 crits was 86.  86/48 = 179%.  Variance from 117 crits being a small sample.  youll never get an empirical proof. they cant exist but 177 is a leading candidate imo.<br>
<br>
<br>
so now we can detirming how much gain in damage i get from 6 alt points.  at a 2% crit rate and a 177% damage.  i get a 1.54% increase in damage for 6 alt points.   <br>
<br>
soooooo what do you think?<br>

Max crit dmg is an exact number off your hit you get crit on so I max out regular backstab at 593 (15 dmg 10 % bs mod) and max crit on a 593 hit is 1016. What ever percentage that is is the percentage crit gives. Ambidexterity is definitly worth it when you get the skill feels like you just got a new source of haste. Think someone parsed diference and it adds like 10-12 dps. chaotic stab is ok but not as awesome as you think. It never has a chance to double and hits 120 when your max hit is already 97. So your gaining from 108-23 for one hit every 4 secs (if it lands). Which don't get me wrong is nice but not all that. ND3 is awesome more hps is best for rogues after you get your dmg skills done. Escape is great and really raid effective. Your fighting uber mob X and MT dies and new MT trying to get aggro but your now on top of list due to the dmg your putting out, boom use escape and now your still fighting instead of asking for a res in to help out with res effects. <br>
<br>
here is my order ive done and seem to work good for me.<br>
<br>
1. innate run 3 (great skill) jboots dont cut it indoors.<br>
2. regen 3 regen is always great for alot of reasons.<br>
3. combat fury 1 crits are nice and enhance dmg but only do first level.<br>
4. combat stability 2 here is where i went with dmg mitigation and liked the results.<br>
5. ND1 and NR1 I had 4 points left over before I could work on class skills did level 1 in each.<br>
6. chaotic stab lowest single skill in class and quickest way to boost your dmg output.<br>
7. ambidexterity  again dmg output should be main consern for rogues since its our job go for the long haul for this skill is very nice.<br>
8. Escape  very nice raid and and exp applications also save some of that level 60 exp you keep losing due to 100% in advance exp.<br>
9. ND3  go back to arch skill finish this up great over all hp boost nice for ae raids where you not always top of list for heals.<br>
10. CS3 go ahead and save up another 6 points to finish off this skill.<br>
11.CA3  this is where im at now great for not taking as much dmg when mobs due turn on you.<br>
12. double riposte this is my next goal want to finish off my max avoidence of dmg when im tanking.<br>
13. NR3 finally get back to this and finish it off regen is nice.<br>
14. Innate stamina if your gear is lacking where your not 255 with focus then beef it up it helps your ND3 skill.<br>
15. everything else is pretty much for play toy if your hurting in resists then id work on those in the innate department. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ulilaradestra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilara d Estra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/22/02 5:28:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=183>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> I recently purchased Combat Fury 3, and I wanted to post my results for you all to see.<br>

I meleed the Soulbinder in Shadow haven for roughly 30mins before and after the purchase of CF3. I used Khalshazar and Windspeeder (41 haste), no spell haste, no atk modifying spells, did not swap in Primal, and I did not backstab.<br>

I went from a 1.81% (1137atk) chance to Critical, to a 2.83% (1369atk) chance to Critical over similar time periods. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ulilaradestra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilara d Estra</A> at: 6/25/02 11:12:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/udaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/30/02 1:54:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=184>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Effect of atk on chance to critical</span><hr size=1> Dexterity is the stat that affects how often you crit. The +100 dex from primal is most likely what caused you to have more crits. It's interesting to me that you got more crits with primal up(what is your unbuffed dex?), but I don't see how atk rating could be a factor. <br>
<br>
I was grouped with another 60 rogue last night. He has cf3 and primal. I have cf1 and no primal. He was getting at least twice as many crits as me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/utwiggetts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twiggetts</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 3:28:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=185>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monks damage</span><hr size=1> EDIT: Lack of caffeine <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/utwiggetts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twiggetts</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/1/02 9:15:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/1/02 5:46:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=186>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monks damage</span><hr size=1> after i saw those numbers i thought dex too.  i initially said a few post back &quot;i dont think it matters ... show me it matters&quot;  think you just did. <br>

well you showed DEX and or ATTACK matters but since warriors have shown dex to matter on their innate crit i think the &quot;guess&quot;  the initial &quot;guess&quot; has to go to dex being the factor in AA crit skill variation.  its sensible.<br>

<br>
The standards:<br>
1.  Run3<br>
2.  Regen3<br>
<br>
Then:<br>
3.  Combat Fury 1, 2  (this was to crit more.  I sometimes wish I had not gotten CF2 so early, though).  This is a small increase in damage overall.  It's mostly nice for show for seeing 1094 and 2181 backstabs.<br>
4.  Natural Durability 1, 2, 3.  My logic here was that if I could live longer on a raid, I'd do more damage.  Getting all the ND gave me an unbuffed HP increase of about 300 hp.<br>
5.  Ambidexterity to increase damage output.  In hindsight, I was thinking that I should have gotten Escape first, for the reasons described above, but this was pretty nice I think.  It isn't a huge increase in damage output as it deals with your offhand swings.  It does make it look like you are doing more though.  With low delay weapons it feels like you are a chain gun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
6.  Combat Agility 1, 2, 3.  Going back to survivability, I talked with a few people and they convinced me that Combat Agility is better than Combat Stability because CS doesn't always mitigate damage in all situations.  I think that this was probably the right choice.<br>
7.  Escape.  Very good skill for exactly the reasons mentioned above.  If the MT dies on AOW, just escape and you're fine.  I can also run from the entrance to The Deep, Echo side, all the way to Ssra using this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
8.  Chaotic Stab.  The previous poster wrote exactly my thinking on this skill.  With a 16 damage weapon, I hit for a max of 103 (non crit) but not usually this much.  The reason that I finally got this one is that it is nice in the arena and when you are tanking (soloing) non-casters.  When soloing, the Chaotic Stab seems to land the majority of the time and is 120 damage if it hits and it can crit for 212.  Overall not bad but I definitely wouldn't say that this is a 'gotta have' skill and, in my opinion, definitely not the first class skill to get.<br>
9.  Combat Stability 1, 2, 3 to go back to the survivability theme.<br>
10.  Natural Healing (1).  I personally do not think that NH 2 or 3 is worth the aap at this time.  Eventually I may get 2 and 3 but not for quite a while.  I'll probably get Double Riposte 2 and 3 before I finish out this one.<br>
11.  Finishing Blow (1).  I will get one point in this just to have it.<br>
12.  Double Riposte (1).  I'm not sure that the other points are worth it just yet.  I may eventually get them.  It is surely good in the arena and when tanking (soloing). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 7/9/02 4:25:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub175.ezboard.com/ulilaradestra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilara d Estra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/8/02 11:07:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=188>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monks damage</span><hr size=1> That's a good point!

<br>
You're correct that a crit is always a set multiplier, but you have you're number wrong.  I went off of min backstab as my basis for crits at first, but you can't do that.  For some reason min backstab follows different rules than normal crits.<br>
<br>
Like you said, crit for min backstab is 177% of its normal damage.  Now, take a look at crit on max backstab for Ragebringer and Khalshazar (Didn't follow my max backstabs with my 13/14 damage primaries) Ragebringer max backstabs at 553, so according to min backstab crit it should land ~978 for max.  This isn't the case, it hits for 948 which is ~171%.<br>
<br>
Now lets take Khalshazar, max backstab is 639.  According to the min backstab rule, it should crit at ~1131.  Again, this isn't the case, it maxes at 1094, which is again ~171% of normal max backstab.<br>
<br>
Follow you're damage for the next few days.  If you have a 15 damage weapon in mainhand, you will not crit over 165 or 166.  If you use a 16 damage weapon, you won't crit over 176.<br>
<br>
Really have no idea why min backstab and everything else follow different rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umarleiah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marleiah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/18/02 8:14:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=190>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> I'm hearing a lot of lvl 60&gt;AA - well, I agree and disagree.  What I think people are doing in their mind, whether they realize it or not, is comparing a level up (say from 56 to 57) with an AA point.  Yeah sure, a lvl up beats a point of AA allocated to any skill.  However, I'm at 56 doing 50/50 AA/exp, and im earning at a rate of at least 5 AA points to one level (a yellow of AA per blue of exp), and actually i think it's closer to a rate of 6AA points per level.  I hear at lvl58/59, you can earn AA at a rate of 9AA points per level.  I think, considering that, the tradeoff is roughly equal... which is why I chose a 50/50 experience distribution.<br>

I want 60 too, and will eventually get it, but I kinda want to have fun with the flashy CF/FB ASAP, and dont want to have to wait till 60 to get it.  <br>
<br>
Also, you say it will go by faster at 60, but that depends on where you are.  To make that true, your areas for leveling will be restricted.  For instance, in several, if not all, camps in sebilis, some of the frogs would be lt blue to you at 60.  I promise you a 57 killing 100% dark blues will get AA faster than a 60 killing 30-40% lt blues mixed amonst dark blues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukaradin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/02 3:16:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=193>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> I disagree, a L 60 killing those same light blue frogs will be killing them faster than a L 57 with the small DPS increasing AAs you have - and can get in better xp camps than Sebilis.

The collective DPS will only be margially better in the second party, and remember the 57 in my scenario is gonna have CF/FB cause he put his exp there, further closing the gap.<br>

Yes, there are better exp places for a 60 though.  (such as CT).  If you dont mind going to the same 2-3 places to experience all the time (velks/CT/luclin), then by all means get 60 first.  Post PoP, this shouldnt be as much of a problem.<br>

At L 60 in Seb on light blues (and dark blues too mind you), assassinate is infinitely better than Finishing Blow.  Finishing Blow requires a mob be at 10% or less life - Assassinate doesn't.  Killing a mob in one shot that is worth half the xp it is to you, means a L 60 kills things faster than you for almost no effort, even if it isn't worth as much.  Even when he doesn't assassinate mobs, a L 60 rogue is on a better damage table than a L 57.  Minimum backstab damage is 120 for the L 60 and 86 for a L 57.  A L 57 rogue's max backstab is also much less.  L 60 rogues simply do more damage than a 57, AA skills or not.<br>
<br>
Your backstab cap and weapon skill caps and damage table change make more of a difference for getting xp faster than having wasted xp getting CF/FB to make xp in 57 go &quot;faster&quot;.  Those xp points are better spent getting 60 for more DPS than you gain for putting them in any AA skills.<br>
<br>
Also, as for the comment on &quot;only&quot; being able to xp in the same 2-3 places, I think you have made a bit of an argumentative fallacy.  You're the one who is &quot;only&quot; xping in one zone (Seb), while a L 60 rogue can get better xp in Velks, CT, Sol B Efreeti camp, FG, ME, Acrylia, Chardok, Ssra, Grey, Seru, Hole, Disco/Juggs in Seb, South/East Wing HS, Umbral Plains, Akheva, or Hate/Fear.  To call Luclin/velks/CT the 2-3 places a L 60 rogue can XP in is a bit off.  Also, Luclin comprises several zones, and as such is more than &quot;one place&quot;.<br>
<br>
As I said before, its your game, xp how you want, but don't discount the facts that L 60 rogues do more damage without AAs than a L 57 with any AAs you can get.  No AA replaces or exceeds the damage table change, the backstab increases, or the skill increases for more DPS.  Getting Run Speed 3 before getting 60 I think is a good way to go, as it helps you live longer if  you need to run to the zone.  Everything else can wait. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulomack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lomack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/8/02 4:35:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=196>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Karadin is completely right.  There are even a few more spots than the ones he listed to get decent xp at 60.<br>
Jaggedpine gnoll caves (granted some are light blue)<br>
Jaggedpine potamied caves (same as above)<br>
Reavers in SoNH<br>
Even West HS can be good xp at 60 if you can pull from above and below the 2nd drop off.<br>
<br>
For most purpouses the difference between the con of a mob from level 57 to 60 is almost neglagable.  Con checks work like the grouping restrictions, in a way.  At level 10 you could only get light blue xp for killing 5th level stuff, and dark blue for 6-9th level stuff.  Basically a 4 level gap.  Yet at 60 you can get dark blue xp down to level 46th, for a 14 level gap.  The gap at 57 is probably about 13 levels of blue, meaning you get dark blue xp down to level 44 mobs.  So you really haven't lost much in the way of npc con levels by gaining those extra 3 levels, yet your dps is quite a bit higher.<br>
<br>
There are a very few situations that I would recomend someone to pump AAs over levels.<br>
1. If the person wanted the character to stay old world dragon capable for Naggy and Vox.<br>
2. If you have a lot of higher level friends that don't mind taking you places with them, the low con stuff they kill will go down much faster, there by giving you better experience since its a higher con to you.  However, for this to really be a noticable benifit the level difference would need to be more substantial than just 3 or 4 levels.  I'm talking a 51 or 52 grouped with a bunch of 60s.<br>
<br>
In the 1st situation you would want to dump more AAs into stuff that allowed you to do old world dragons easier, resists and such.<br>
In the 2nd situation you would only want to accumulate a stock pile of AAs and not spend them on general skills.  This really has limited uses though, because effectively your getting AA points that you can't (or don't want to spend yet) so basically its defered xp till you reach 55th or 59th.  Someone doing this may be able to accumulate AAs faster than someone at 60, but thats only due to the efficiency and kindness of the high levels that are essentially pleveling him/her.<br>
<br>
For the general person<br>
level 60 &gt; any AA points, because just the loss of the lowered skill caps makes a huge difference.  As a rogue, unless your gear is above par, the 3 levels of Natural Durability are probably equal to the HPs you would gain just from levels.  The mitigation and absorption AC you gain from Combat Stability and Combat Agility would be off set by 30 points of Dodge skill, ~15ish points of Defense skill, and 9 points of Parry skill.  Thats to say nothing of the offensive bonuses which you don't really get through AAs till you have access to the class abilities.  Which would be 12 points of Double Attack, ~10ish points of Duel Weild, ~7ish points of Backstab + Assassinate,  ~7ish points of Riposte skill, 12 points of piercing, as well as 15 points in 1hb and 1hs each.<br>

At 40, 30 is the lowest level dark blue you can kill.  At 60, 45 is the lowest.  Plan your xp hunting so that you can find the highest number of mobs which just barely con dark blue, because that allows the you to maximize the number of kills and xp your group (or solo) is capable of.   Once mobs start getting up into the 40s, their hp starts to increase dramatically.  A level 47 mob has 2x (probably more) the amount of hp of a level 41 mob.   For most groups, this has a huge impact on their rate of xp.<br>
<br>
We can be happy I guess... after about 63 AA there's nothing worth spending on that makes a real difference in the game.  Everything else is just useless fluff.  So the mindless xp grind comes to a hault early for rogues.  Real improvements such as an Evade AA or something useful for a different class were apparently foregone for amazingly important issues such as &quot;canoe transportation&quot; and &quot;Rings of StillBuggyAfterSixMonths&quot;.   Don't even get me started on the VT tuning... I'm about ready to explode on the boards about it (and already have in /gu.  Every... single....day).  I know it's a case of too much to do with too few resources, but jeese, hire some more help with that $1M Smed &quot;marveled&quot; about.  Hopefully things will turn around and we'll see good things from PoP... but not without some more attention to live content.  Each expansion gets worse and worse... it's a waterfall effect.  Velious was released unfinished... and 3-4 months later they eventually tuned it up.  Luclin was released unfinished, and it's still not done.  At this rate PoP will be released with 3 of the 18? new zones and by 2004 zones 5 and 6 will be open.  Of course, I'm being sarcastic... but I think you get the idea about how jaded I've become about eqlive content.  <br>
<br>
To me it just seems like the powers-that-be throw out an expansion for a huge $$ intake on initial sales, then move resources to work on the next big $$ venture while our 450k+ userbase pumps in monthly dues on their unfinished product.  Meanwhile the poor live team gets stuck dealing with every bug under the sun for the newest expansion AND has to deal with balance issues which result from the new content... all the while being understaffed to handle any of it within a reasonable turnaround time.  This pisses off devs, who quit (or get fired), and leave behind half finished projects and assignments that other devs are forced to take time to get up to speed and fix (in addition to the old issues they were working on).  *breathe*  And then, we get to play beta testers for 12.95 a month ^_^  <br>

I will indeed have CF before 60, so I guess you guys can just eat your heart out. :-)<br>
