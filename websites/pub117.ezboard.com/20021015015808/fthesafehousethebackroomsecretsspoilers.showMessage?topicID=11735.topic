class=m><span class=title> Re: Standard RoF in Acrylia Revamped ?</span><hr size=1> Ya, I tried RoF about a week ago with a couple other guild parties (total of 29 of us) and had 3 consecutive wipeouts on the first boss (well sort of...).  We positioned a druid alt of one of the players in the ring to start it off.  About 2 minues later, 5 skellies spawned around the ring, random priests and melee skellies.  About 2 minutes later, another 3 popped.  Then 3 more a couple minutes after that.  Then, guess what?...3 more.  It kept spawning.  Well, with over 12 mobs up in such a short time, our chanters got wiped out due to the high MR of these things, they kept resisting mezzes.  Then once the chanters were down, they went after the next target.  I don't know how many of you have done this RoF, but these mobs have a ton of hp, are lvl 52 to 56 (some higher) and hit for about 150ish.  After the first 4 or 5 skellies (mainly concentrating on the priests since they heal the others), the Battlemaster spawned.  Some say he is the 1st boss, others say the 2nd.  We did manage to take down the Battlemaster but more regular priest and melee skellies kept on popping, including the Battlelord this time (again, 1st or 2nd boss).  Well, lvl 60 MT dropped like a rock after having about a half dozen of these unmezzed skellies pounding on him, including the lvl 58 Battlelord).  Same with the 58 2T and 57 3T.  Then it was chaos as the skellies proceeded to rip apart everything in the area.  I kid you not, when I finally managed to get FD to stick (it failed twice....stupid Verant.....) I counted 18 'depop messages' form the skellies in the room.  I don't know about you, but 18 mobs at once, on the FIRST ring fights seems a bit much to me.<br><br>It might be pure bad luck we experienced the 6 times we tried the event, who knows.  We're not inexperienced.  This same crowd has taken down the Servitor of Luclin as well as Grieg before, and a whole slew of other new badass mobs in Luclin; but this was ridiculous.  If the lvls of the early stages of mobs weren't bad enough, the sheer numbers are enough to annihilate any crowd in this very enclosed and tiny room we have to fight in.  I know some of you may say 'just get more people' but this room is VERY limited on space to begin with, NOT counting the number of mobs.  <br><br>Anyone with ideas on HOW we could actually survive long enough to get to the good drops in the 3rd or 4th bosses, I'm more than keen to know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ueldryc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eldryc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/6/02 4:29:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11735.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Standard RoF in Acrylia Revamped ?</span><hr size=1> it's harder now than what the web site we tried to use for information about it last month indicated.

With 5 groups, split them up that 3 groups assist one tank, and the other 2 assist another. Less crowds around the mobs that way. The MR of these mobs really isn't all that bad, unless your enchanters are fairly low level. All of them are either clerics or SKs, so Theft of Thought keeps the enchanters regaining mana fairly quickly. Especially since you'd be unwise to sit to med, since the mobs that spawn HT people sitting down first.<br><br>We've done the AE route before. The problem with it was that the number of rounds you had to go through was random. So, you had to kill them all before the bosses showed up, and there was some guesswork to it. So, you drop the burns after the 6th bunch spawned, and then 4 more spawn, with the nukers and enchanters now fairly low on mana. Would work great if you knew for sure when the bosses were to spawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umuntho.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muntho</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://biggerin.homestead.com/files/bos.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/02 7:03:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11735.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Standard RoF in Acrylia Revamped ?</span><hr size=1> Does anyone know if you pull the Warmonger (or any red con) to one side of the ring and the AE set up on the other side, will the chanter AE stun reach over to the Warmonger?
