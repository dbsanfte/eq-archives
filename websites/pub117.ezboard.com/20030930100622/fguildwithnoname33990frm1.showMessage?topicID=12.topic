<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Guild Mission</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
Our guild is a close-knit family of friends. We seek to have fun, to interact with each other, to explore, and to better our skills. We value easygoing, flexible, and mature people who enjoy laughing and teasing each other. We value people who are interested in playing the game well. We support each other in enjoying the game and each other, while seeking to play our characters to the best of our abilities. We value new experiences and exploration.<br>
<br>
We are not an uber guild, nor do we have an emphasis on growth. We strive to be the guild that our members will consider to be the last guild they ever join. Our characters are 50+ and most of us play alts as well.<br>
<br>
We are an adult-based guild and some of the language in guildchat may not be suitable for younger players. We ask that you be 18 or older before expressing a desire to join our guild. (However certain exceptions may exist based on maturity level and overall personality.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Expected Conduct</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In-game</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
We strive to behave with courtesy, patience, and tolerance to all and to never behave in such a way that would damage our guild’s reputation. We are helpful people, but we hate beggars. We support the “Play Nice Policies” set forth by SOE as well as the unwritten rules of courtesy accepted by many in the Quellious community. We seek alternatives to confrontation whenever possible and avoid incidents that are all too often dissected on Flame boards.<br>
<br>
We request (but do not demand) from our guildmates such things as ports, summons, buffs, and resurrections. We request (but do not demand) trade skill combines from our guildmates, providing them with the components (or the plat to cover the components).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Message boards</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Read with best intentions and then read it again. Flaming and name-calling will not be permitted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Guild Hierarchy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guild leadership</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
The guild leaders are Tarf, Blitzfeld, and Petunya. The guild leaders will always ask for input from all guild members and consider all ideas, but are responsible for seeing that a clear decision is made in a timely manner. The guild leaders favor as few rules as possible and as little intervention as possible and will only act when unanimously in agreement with each other.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Officers</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Anyone in the guild is allowed to be an officer except recruits. Officers will be made at the discretion of the guild leadership.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Recruitment Policy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
We do not recruit. To join our guild, you must be recommended by a member and no less than two members must be willing to sponsor you. Sponsors are responsible for providing recruits information about our guild and directing potential recruits to the message board. Recruits are expected to post their intentions on our message board with a description about themselves and acknowledgement of our policies. Recruits who have characters in other guilds should include the names of the alts and the guilds in this description.<br>
<br>
In general we do not favor guilding recruits who have characters in other guilds because of the high potential for a conflict of interest, however, exceptions may be approved by the guild leadership.<br>
<br>
Once the sponsors feel it is appropriate, a vote should be held to determine if a recruit should be guilded on a trial basis. It is the responsibility of the recruit to get to know everyone in the guild and the current guild members to make themselves available to get to know the recruit. We want to be sure that the fit is a good one for all involved.<br>
<br>
After one month, the sponsors will take an informal survey of all members to determine if there are any problems. Any guild member who has an issue with a recruit is asked to speak to the guild leadership and the sponsors immediately to see if the situation can be resolved.<br>
<br>
After the probationary period of one month, and sometime during the following month, the sponsors will request the guild leadership to conduct the vote on the recruit. The guild leadership will contact each guild member through email or in-game for their vote of yes, no, or abstain. The leadership will review the comments of those voting no or abstaining and determine whether or not the recruit should be granted full membership, removed from the guild, or have their probationary period extended.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Member Removal</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
If for any reason the leadership of the guild unanimously agrees a member is having a negative impact on the guild, the member will be removed. This decision is not one taken lightly and every effort will be made to speak with the member before any problems can escalate to this point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Loot Policy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
All guild members are required to have a Magelo profile. We will endeavor to assist each other in determining how to best upgrade each other's equipment. When an item drops on a raid, anyone who can equip the item should link what they have in that slot currently (even if they are passing) and then we discuss it. We discuss how much of an upgrade it represents, how long you would wear it (no one should take an item that they intend to sell or trade), how long since it's been since you got something nice, and which classes seem to benefit the most, among other things. We favor the Can and Should Use protocol. A list will be maintained to track loot distribution. We encourage our members to pass their gear on to their guildmates. Any items not distributed will go to the guild bank.<br>
