<br>
Rogues haven't seen a decent damage increase since Kunark, and with the recent &quot;rebalancing&quot; for casters, it's not only possible for them to completely annihilate my dps, it happens on a nightly basis. For example, Diabo Xi Xin Thall parsed out for me to be 75.6 dps. The best wizard output on the same mob (using garrisons, he did not have destruction of ice), in the same amount of time was 168 dps. I could be mistaken here, but that seems just a BIT out of whack. For everything that wizards get with respect to utility, and ability to solo, for them to so utterly destroy our DPS is retarded. &quot;Caster balancing&quot; has thus far seemed to me to be random at best, and destructive with respect to game balance at worst.<br>
<br>
In addition to wizards oudamaging rogues, it's 100% possible, and likely for necros to be able to do the same with the new dot changes, using 4-5 dots. I'm not saying that it will happen every time, but with certainty, it's possible.<br>
<br>
Rogues happen to offer very little except for damage. We can sneak around, and I'm happy that they've finally decided to give us the bonus of being able to hide/sneak past mobs that others would be seen by. That's great, though it shouldn't have to be something we buy extra, it's helpful. But when you compare rogue utility to other classes, we fall short on almost every level. Without a fairly decent increase in damage in PoP, it's not really going to be worth looking to play our class if you're looking for some sort of return for your time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jake0>Jake0</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/24/02 3:00:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12012.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> 75dps? heh,  get more atk buddy, that's not so uber even though DXX has insane mitigation.

But your smoking bad crack if you think wizards Aggressivly nuking dont damage us.  If you can fuel them (Wizards eating Mod Rods). . .5 Wizards in Group with best Gear/Spells in the game will BEAT US on high AC/Mitigation mobs reguardless of Attk/Haste/Mods.<br>

<br>
Lots of people asked for this stuff - specifically.<br>
<br>
ATK boost - raising the str cap = more str = more ATK<br>
more crits<br>
better chance for double backstab (double BS is based on DA skill right? Ferocity increases DA...)<br>
faster hide refresh<br>
melee subtlety<br>
reduced re-use time on skills (discs actually, but escape works too)<br>
super-sneak<br>
and hide while moving is terrific. Everyone screws up sometimes and gets smacked, even less chance of failing an evade because you're being knocked around is good.<br>
<br>
I'm honestly suprised it's as good as it looks. Depending on how it's implemented, and how long it takes to fix everything they break, PoP might not be the suckball it looks to be. Though honestly, they'd have to try pretty hard to make something worse than SoL.<br>

Backstab skill caps at level 60 with one of the 12%+ pokers already, so getting 65 wouldn´t up the hits one bit. Minimum should be 130 though, whoopdedoo :P<br>
<br>
About the skills, the rogues are dissapointed of the lack of viable *class* skills. The arch skills (like higher DA, crits etc) are all common for the melees and I am sure the caster versions are at least as good (or as in SoL, ten times better).<br>
<br>
The improved sneak looks good on paper, hopefully it will reintroduce one of the rogue-roles in EQ. Other than that I think the AA skills are on par with SoL ones (i.e. utter crap). Good thing I don´t have to grind to get any though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Give our class some GD depth, or if you're going to keep it one dimensional, allow it to keep pace in that &quot;one-trick&quot; with other classes.  <br>

FoH's parses are crap (get rid of those rusty short swords, and comparing someone attacking from the front vs people attacking from the back isn't balanced). next? monks (who have less than half the HPs of a warrior, unbuffed, and ~3k less fully buffed, and on average 200 less AC) monk simply tank as well as any other non-warrior melee class on mobs that don't 'require' defensive. hell, paladins and SKs tank better than monks...<br>
oh, yah, mend wounds. 25% hps, every 6 minutes... adding an 'extra' 25% to the base HPs of monks, and they still have far less HP than warriors, its more of a 'oh crap,  Feign Death failed AGAIN, hope i can mend and survive another 10 seconds to try again' skill. and monks only have decent solo quality at lvls &gt; 55 when they have a fungi tunic, but the same can be said of most melee classes, so, remind me again, where is the actual problem? someone just needed to vent and lashed out at a convient target?<br>

All we needed was a DPS upgrade.  A skill that Halved the Backstab Timer,  Double Chaotic Stab,  Guarenteed a Triple Backstab 50% of the time (Quad 5% of the time). <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Everyone at a raid gets buffs - the idea is to get max effectiveness from the overall raid by making sure each person at the raid does the most effective task for their class.  Some classes are getting max effectiveness by focussing on wizards.  Mages summoning rods to give to a wizard aren't doing their own DD.  Necros passing along mana after they stick DoTs aren't doing their DD.  Bards don't get much DD, but passing along mana to casters is most effective when it includes wizards and clerics.  Healers watching wizards that mod aren't doing whatever else they could be doing.  <br>
<br>
There's no way a wizard without all that assistance could come close to the DPS reported.  Currently, a decently equipped Rogue only needs a compenent MT, some buffs, and a heal now and then to be at their max effectiveness.<br>
<br>
I really don't think it unbalanced that by having some classes focus on servicing wizards that the overall DPS of the raid goes up.  I would like to see something similiar added to Rogues though.  Rogues should be able to do comparable damage if the same attention were focussed on them.<br>

Wrongo, a rogue needs the MT, heals, speed, atk buffs, avatar, savagery, a bard going full on atk/warsong, and even after all of this wizards beat us in 99% of scenarios now.  And they own us in utility and solo power.  Again I'm going to withhold further judgement on everything till I see what we gain innately from the  levels in PoP, but Verant needs to give us our spot as top dmg dealer back.   We gave up everything to have it afterall, take away our one trick and we're just a pony to be kicked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=12012.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=12012.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showPrevMessage?topicID=12012.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showNextMessage?topicID=12012.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12012.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.evercrack.net/shpics/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.emailToFriend?topicID=12012.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.threadControl?topicID=12012.topic><img src=http://www.thesafehouse.org/images/dagger.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12012.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12012.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub117.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion">Main Lounge<option value="thesafehousefrm31">Official News<option value="thesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies">Training Studio<option value="thesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers">The Back Alley<option value="thesafehousefrm13">Quests of Norrath<option value="thesafehousetherootcellar">The Root Cellar<option value="thesafehouselaboratory">Laboratory<option value="thesafehousefrm15">The Arena<option value="thesafehousefrm30">Lesser Classes<option value="thesafehousefrm19">Main Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm22">Stealth Training<option value="thesafehousefrm23">Information Underground<option value="thesafehouseoutsidenorrath">Logged Out<option value="thesafehousefrm25">Pen & Paper Rogues<option value="thesafehousefrm27">NWN Discussion<option value="thesafehouseranthallgripeswishes">Rant Hall<option value="thesafehousefrm28">Safehouse Workshop<option value="thesafehousebythefireplace">By The Fireplace<option value="thesafehouseretirementwing">Retirement Wing<option value="thesafehouselibraryreadonly">Library (Read-Only)<option value="thesafehousefrm16">Admin</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/bthesafehouse>The Safehouse</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers>The Back Alley</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse website</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <!-- Search Google -->
