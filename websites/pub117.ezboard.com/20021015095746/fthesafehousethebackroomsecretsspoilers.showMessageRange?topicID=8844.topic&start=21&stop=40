The other options available aren't all that overwealmly significant for a rogue.<br>
<br>
Many of us that have all ready reached the higher levels have gotten our stats and resists to levels, where more may or may not serve any significant purpous.  It gets quite difficult to tell.<br>
<br>
This leaves us with the 5 skills at the bottom.<br>
- First Aid, while handy, requires bandages, and its not something that helps us during a prolonged fight.<br>
- Natural Lung Capacity, most at this point have Enduring Breath items.<br>
- Improved Natural Metabolism, sounds kinda cool, but its not going to help my character be more efficient, except to be able to hold more loot inplace of food.<br>
<br>
That leaves us with Natural Run Speed and Natural Regeneration.  Anyone with Jboots will probably run as fast or faster than someone with the runs speed ability maxed.  VI has stated that the run speed won't be as fast as sow.  I can see this being a great bonus indoors, but that means its only working a portion of the time.  Not to mention that max skilling in both of these abilities would be needed to gain access to the Archetype Abilities.  This leaves us with Natural Regeneration, admitidly not the most usefull thing in the world, but with a maxed ability in this you will be gaining an extra 3 hps every 6 seconds, in addition to any other regen you might have working for you (natural plus items).  Overall in long fight sequences where area damage takes place this can add up to a significant mana savings for the people trying to keep us alive.  As I see it, part of a rogue's job is to try not to take damage, while dispensing as much as possible.  It just seems logical that any damage we can restore faster would only benifit the party or raid overall.<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly there was a post a while back, about how many rogues were wearing fungi tunics when on raids, because it made a noticable impact in how much mana the healers had to devote to keeping the rogue alive when that mana could have been spent on healing a more primary tank.<br>
<br>
The reason why not to continue the regen enhancment in the Archetype ability section is that many of those abilities appear to be more advantageous. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/udietrichsoulpiercer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dietrich SoulPiercer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/6/01 2:44:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> XP per point.</span><hr size=1> From actually Playing.....<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Poison Mastery</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
- Reduces the chance for failure on combine of any poison by 10, 25, 50%<br>
- Each level reduces the time for applying by 2.5 seconds (meaning at level 3 you need less than 1 sec to apply if I remember the apply time correctly with 8 secs)<br>
- When you got at least 1 point in this ability, you will never fail an apply again<br>

Really? I didn't hear this. <br>
<br>
Is it making the *existing* poisons stackable? Or creating some new pain in the butt poison you have to gather components for stackable. That's the real question.<br>
<br>
The only thing holding me back from using poisons is space in my inventory.<br>

Basically only Escape and maybe chaotic stab are worth getting. Escape is useful, but chaotic stab will only benefit you when you're tanking (how often does a rogue actively tank?) or a mob is positioned badly on a raid (which shouldnt happen that often if you have a competent guild).<br>
<br>
So, basically only escape is useful, and thats something we will only use to survive wipeouts or as an emergency evade for a tank switch in a long fight or something..<br>

<br>
Would that ability really matter? How often are you in front of a MOB?<br>
<br>
I mean, it sounds nice on paper, but I'd say %95 of the time I'm behind a mob.<br>
<br>
So 95% of the time I have a chance to land a full backstab.<br>
<br>
Why would I care to land a minimum backstab from the front when there's many other skills to put points into?<br>
<br>
That's just my take. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/usolann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/6/01 10:30:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: XP per point.</span><hr size=1> looking at the PvP point of view this would improves rogues damage output <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/upherret.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pherret</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/6/01 10:32:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: XP per point.</span><hr size=1> In a normal group situation, I would agree with you but there are times when I'm physically unable to get around to the back of the mob or it's pingponging around.

I would guess it's pretty handy for times when you're forced to solo.  ~100 extra dmg every 6 seconds isn't anything insignificant.  <br>
<br>
I would take the other skills before this one however. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzeik2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeik2001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/01 3:57:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: XP per point.</span><hr size=1> &quot;Chaotic Stab: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability allows the Rogue to do his minimum backstab damage on any backstab attempt, even if that attempt is not made while behind the opponent.&quot;<br>

Does that mean you'll NEVER miss with a Backstab? It's what it sounds like, but it could mean other things too...<br>
<br>
&quot;edit, oh and even if not, well, being able to stab from the front with say, FOR EXAMPLE, a 3 damage weapon for 120 at level 60... well, thats pretty good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uzeik2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeik2001</A> at: 12/7/01 3:58:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/utotteswede.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TotteSwede</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/7/01 4:44:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: XP per point.</span><hr size=1> If it lands every BS (min dmg if from front) then it´s a decent upgrade to dmg for rogues.

<br>
Hrm, I dunno. The description is vague.  If it means you hit with every backstab attempt then it is indeed a big improvement.<br>
<br>
If it's just taken as it's read that you can do minimum backstab damage from the front ... then it doesn't seem like a worth while upgrade to me. Because, we already do minimum backstab damage from the back ... IF we hit. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uavrus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Avrus</A> at: 12/7/01 10:10:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/umurrdurr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Murr Durr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/9/01 9:59:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Thought I'd post this..<br>

<br>
If its based on dex it'll be one hell of an improvment(i as a halfling have a base dex of 110+ all the other crap from gear, i think its around 166 or so unbuffed and its not even a stat i really try to keep up).<br>
<br>
If not its still pretty nice. Chaotic Stab dosnt look TOOO bad but the description is pathetic. It really dosnt give any specific idea of what it actualy does(i mean 100% assurance of its effect).<br>
<br>
BTW, what do you guys thing about the dmg mitigation one? <br>
<br>
I was thinking resists/dmg combo. The worst thing about mobs you need resists for is you have to sac other stats(hp/ac/str and overall atk/dmg potential) just to survive long enough to do anything remotely signeficant.
