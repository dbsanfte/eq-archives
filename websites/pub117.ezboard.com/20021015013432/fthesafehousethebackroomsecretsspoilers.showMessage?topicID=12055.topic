Practice on the Idol unslowed. He's similar to the Avatar but no flurries and has less HP. If you can kill the Idol unslowed fairly easily, you may have a good shot at the Avatar. If you kill the Idol slowed without practicing it, then expect the other guilds on your server to hate you for blowing the Avatar spawn for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/udummywummy01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dummywummy01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/02 7:41:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12055.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoW strat</span><hr size=1> Only other guild on my server is mostly full of jerkoffs, i have no problem with blowing AoW <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/uislington.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Islington</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/02 8:02:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12055.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoW strat</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Only other guild on my server is mostly full of jerkoffs, i have no problem with blowing AoW <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Fight it Unslowed anyway.  It gives you a chance to perfect your strat and technique and you can try over and over and over again until you have it right.  The Idol is a perfect Mob to practice on because the AOW is simply in an unreal Mob.  You can practice positioning and tactics as long as it takes and when you kill it easily, unslowed, you know you at least have the ability to kill AOW.<br><br>Slow the Idol?  You learn nothing and you get to wipe out to AOW without ever really testing yourself or learning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/udeanob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deanob</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/02 11:02:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12055.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> a tip</span><hr size=1> A little tip for you.  Although idol's DPS output is almost the same.  That flurry makes it much harder.  When you add the flurry to that kind of DPS.  It gives you spikes of damage.  In that case.. sometimes you can get very lucky and not get a double flurry after a full hitting quad (not including reposts) and sometimes your unlucky.  That will make or break keeping your MT alive.  (unless he has 8k hp)<br><br>The fight has to do with some luck for the new crowd.<br><br>Also, unless you got your CH rotations down.  Try looking up a tactic about duel CH rotations.  Might help you if you dont got any tanks 7.3k hp +.<br><br><a href="http://www.fiveassedmonkey.net">Grey Hawke</a><br>If you want to check out some tactics.

You can cripple it.<br><br>Positioning.<br><br>There are 2 different slots that people use these days. All the more exotic ideas like EW zone etc have been abandoned. People either stay inside the arena and use one of the corners where the walls meet at a angle and there's a small nook. Or they stay at the corner just down the ramp. The idea is the same. Shrink the tank and stick him in the nook, all push AoW from behind, and since the AoW is so big he wont be pushed past a certain point and then push as you may the MT will always be the one closest to him and the only one taking ripostes.<br><br>Tanking.<br><br>Have your best hp tank go first. Preferably ALL your tanks have AE taunt. If they dont, farm some snare pods from the ring events in FG. They can be recharged for 700pp using vendor trick. Always keep those handy for your tanks for ALL fights from here on. Tank stands in corner, pulls AoW with arrow (if inside arena and monk pulls him out to middle), AE taunts when in range, goes defensive, blows a snare pod, and soloes him for 10-15 seconds before rest go in and start pushing him to the assigned corner. <br><br>3 minutes later his defensive falls. THE most critical thing about AoW is tank switching. Although we've recently started 1-tanked him, it is by no means a given. Here's the cleanest way.<br><br>Nimble-Tanking / MT switching<br><br>1 assigned rog etc will help nimble tank on each MT switch. Monk/Ranger can be used too. Instead of evading / fd'ing to lose agro they start building it up to the point they are next in line for agro after the MT. As soon as the MT dies they get agro and activate their 9 sec invul disc (monk/ rangers have equivalent ones too) and that gives 9 sec for the heal team to start the CH-order on the next tank and allows a buffer. As soon as the Nimble Tank is dead, the next Tank AE taunts, blows his snare pod till he gets agro. By now he should have the CH order on him and will move back to the corner and ppl push AoW back in. As you can see agro management is important. Another 3 min, rinse repeat.<br><br>CH order Healing<br><br>We've used 6-10 clerics in the CH order. We tend to heal generously for 2 reasons. Firstly it assures that there's no way a small spike or small delay or small mistake will cause your tank to die while defensive. Secondly your tanks will last longer than their 3 min disc. Sometimes a lot longer, sometimes not so. But less MT switching is better. If you guys arent used to CH-orders and massive mana regeneration, here's how it's done. With 3 shamans you can put 2 shamans with all the clerics and 1 with all the mages. Shamans use Torpor/cann etc to keep their own mana up. They will torpor the clerics as they eat rods. They torpor the mages as they rod down to get more mana to drop more rods. The cleric going first in the order needs to start it long before the AoW hits the MT. Support healers will be hard pressed to keep MT up for 10 seconds. 2-3 max.  Also he needs to switch to the next MT the instant this one dies. Nimble tanking will give you 9 second and support healers a few more on that. But the next tank needs to get on CH order fast. As for pause, like I said, be very generous and go very fast, who cares if you overheal as long as you have mana (/hug mod rod 2).<br><br>Support healers.<br><br>Pretty much all rangers, paladins, druids, non ch-order clerics, shamans, enc (rune), beastlords can be called support healers. Support healing is required in the start of the fight and on MT switches. Otherwise your CH order should manage. So spam heals on the MT when first engages for 5-10 seconds , then the CH-order should have him. And then on every MT switch spam heals on the next MT till the CH order gets hold. Support healing is critical.<br><br>Miscellaneous.<br><br>You can debuff AoW and cripple is important. That is why you send your best tank in the start so you can get AoW crippled while your best hitpoints tank is on him. Get Malo/Tash/OOS/bard tash on him, then malosini and cripple. Bard damage shield alone can be your biggest single DPS. Make sure tanks use shaman potions if they can as well to further increase it. Cast Divine Intervention on tanks in start for MT and when their turn comes for rest when you can. It goes off more often than you think. Recast it on tank if it DOES go off. <br><br>Hmmmmmmmm cant think of much else.
