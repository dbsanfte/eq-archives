The regens are nice too, when you start parsing numbers in the long hall, the regen can really start to add up.<br>
<br>
Rmemeber when increasing AC up in the high range, you really only end up decreasing average damge taken by 1-2 points per hit at best.  If you have 6 extra regen working for you, it can be just as benificial as going from 1100 ac to 1300 ac, after parsing is done.  Thats more of an approximate guess.  I know rogues are not tanks, but sometimes when that evade button just dosen't wana work right, AC/HP/Regen can make or break you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukayleighdrake.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KayleighDrake</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/4/02 1:21:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=142>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Combat Fury 2 is a waste - don't bother.

Possibly more damage on average, but I really doubt a higher damage number, beyond whats possible with CF1.  I've seen and have performed critical hit backstabs with Combat Fury 1, that did just over 1000 points of damage, with out the use of any discipline.<br>
<br>
I personally haven't done so, but have seen other rogues crit in back to back shots.  I know our overall DPS isn't really affected that much by Combat Fury, its more just for show.  But, could you imagine the cry from other classes if the rogue did 4000+ damage with a double critical backstab, while using Duelist Discipline?<br>
<br>
While the chances of this occuring are quite slim, an increase in damage with more Combat Fury skill would only serve to make these numbers more insane in appearance.  Personally I want my overall DPS to get better.  I have no real desire to even come close to infringing on a manaburn in possible potential. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ukyleei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kyleei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/7/02 6:11:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=145>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> But the fact remains I would still need to spend 10 others points at that level (archetype?) before I can move up to class skills.  And none of the others in that set are going to add to my damage at all, other than finishing blow maybe which is useless on the stronger mobs that don't even flee.  So that's my question.  Even if it's only a slight upgrade in damage, that's what I'm looking for.  Or would it just be better to spread the points over the other skills, even though they won't necessarily affect my dps either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulomack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lomack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/8/02 12:43:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=146>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Kyleei,<br>
<br>
I don't know if im the best one to answer the question yet, since im just about to get the points for the defensive abilities in the Arch section.  So far I have:<br>
CF1<br>
FB1<br>
NH1<br>
ND1<br>
<br>
As it stands now Im going with CS1, and CA1, and then moving to Class abilites.  I should have one of those 2 by tomarrow, but maybe someone else can answer the following questions...<br>
<br>
Which is better as a rogue, CS1 or CA1?  Does it help to totally evade more blows (CA1), or is the stuff at these levels gona hit you anyway, which makes CS1 better?<br>
<br>
If I was going to put an Arch skill up to level 2, before going on to Class skills I would probably go with ND2.  IMHO even a few more hps can help your surviability on raids.  I doubt the difference between CF1 and CF2 will show as much of a difference.  Just my oppinion though.<br>

<br>
Escape: no offense we got the shaft here. it should be 3 skill levels, 3 points each maybe, and the timer should decrease 72, 36, 18. Keep in mind if this is absolutly identical to feign death, that we are only hidden after we use it, unlike monks who are feigned. So even if we completly wipe agro, the mob is just going to reaggro us if we are near to it and our 72 minutes is down the toilet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well I have the skill dude, and I stand by what I posted. It works 100 percent of the time? You bet, but if your near the monster it will regro you 100 percent of the time. Think of this is a great skill to <br>
1)avoid geting sumoned by gating mobs) <br>
2) great for derailing a train if you have stuff agro on you that you can keep ahead of<br>
3) great if your &quot;about&quot; to die and you have stuff wailing on you due to a fuxored evade<br>
<br>
You reagro very fast when near mobs that see invis, or even mobs that do not if you linger nearby to long. The timer should be able to be reduced with more AA training. That said however its still worth getting vs other class skills.<br>

e. 3 poiints into natural durability<br>

g. go back to a and start all over to go to 2nd skill levels of a-f then to 3rd skill lvls till they all capped.<br>
then im going to plvl myself to 60<br>
then work on trade skills<br>
a. 9 points into ambidexterity<br>
b. 18 points into double riposte (being plvled ur the main tank)<br>
c. 6 points into chaotic stab<br>
d. 18 points into poison mastery<br>

Feel free to not take the advice, but I think you will find yourself doing better, faster, if you concentrate more on leveling than AA skills.  My general recomendation to people is when they hit 51, put 10%-20% of their xp into AA skills and then level like normal.  RS is really handy, the NR is nice too.  But, I feel its much much more important to have the levels than more AAs after this point.<br>
<br>
You mention that after 55th you want to put 3 points into CF, CA, CS, NH, ND, and FB.  Either your not reading something right or you didn't post correctly (no offense).  Each of those skills mentioned take 2 AA points to get level 1, 4 more aa points to get level 2, and 6 more aa points to get level 3.  So spending 3 points into each of those skills is not possible.  However, even if you just wanted level 1 in all those skills thats still 12 aa points prior to reaching level 55, and 14 more points prior to your second round of Arch skills which will take you 24 more aa points, and level 3 in each another 36 points.  Thats a total of 74 AA points distributed prior to leveling past 56?  Sure your going to be one heck of a level 56 player, but any level 60 is still going to hit harder, do more damage, have better ac, have more hps than you will, and will probably get to 60th before you finish that goal.<br>
<br>
Levels &gt; AA skills.<br>
<br>
Personally I would recomend putting a small percentage of your xp into aa skills and leveling like normal.  Adjust the % into AA points so that by the time you hit 55th you have RS3, NR3.  The first aid may help with soloing but its not that efficient for a rogue to solo since you won't be getting in backstabs.  The natural stamina is only going to give you an extra 15hps.  Now sure I could use an extra 15hps, it can't hurt, but at the sacrifice of getting those levels faster or devoting points to other abilites, I think not.<br>
<br>
Once you get to 55th and have RS3 and NR3, I would probably keep leveling with that low percentage going to AA points.  Leveling from 55 to 60 is, imho, going to make you so much better as a rogue than maxing any 3 of those Arch abilities.  And it will probably take less time to get to at least 59 than it will to max even 2 of those Arch skills.<br>
<br>
Once you get the levels and are 60th you can always go back and get the AA skills you passed over, but instead of putting points into Natural Stamina thats 3 skill points you can put into Ambidexterity which im sure will give you a better overall gain in character performance.<br>
<br>
just my 2 cents.<br>

<br>
First of all, once you hit 55, you get double BS, which increases your overall damage (and will get you more groups).  A rogue's damage output at lvl 60 is far superior to that of 58 or 59, especially with assassinate attached to it.  IMO, levels should be your biggest priority, then you can concentrate on the added extras.  <br>
<br>
I've gained 1 x axp level so far - RS1, and that's just from raiding exp (I channel 100% exp from raids into axp).  I'd rather keep buying sow potions till 60, than get RS3 now and lose all that extra dmg output in the meantime.<br>

<br>
If Ambi does in fact increase your offhand chance to swing by 25%, that'd be a 25% increase on offhand procs, yes?  So say you are using primal in offhand.  That'd mean you are more likely to have Avatar up at all times.  If you are using an offhander that has a DD proc, that'd be a 25% increase in the DD procs.  So ya gotta remember offhander procs when thinking about getting Ambi.<br>
<br>
As for Escape, the reason I'm probably going to get it first is that it adds an ability we do not normally have as rogues.  Yes, Ambi gives more dps and would make me better at my primary role, but so would just getting a better weapon.  The fact that Escape gives me a useful ability I would otherwise not have just seems like it'd be more worth it.  <br>

It would be cool if they add like a 10-20% or so chance to triple backstab at least. maybe raise the assasinate cap...<br>
Make us be able to hide(evade) while moving. make us invis to ALL mobs under level 63 or so for like 18 AA. A huge bonus to instill doubt maybe? ;p <br>

Would have also been nice to get endless quiver... or at least endless bandoleer (and add some 30+ dmg throwers for elves/humans/shorts ;p).<br>

Give us somethin crazy like double/triple throw... throwing does so much less dmg than archery.

Bought Ambidexterity today and did a small test that might be of interest.<br>
<br>
Before buying ambidex:<br>
<br>
Wielding Fire beetle eye in primary hand and braided strands in offhand, attacking shadowhaven soulbinder from the back for 15 mins(CoF, no other haste):<br>
<br>
633 hits (9226 damage)<br>
311 misses<br>
-----------<br>
944 swings<br>
<br>
Then bought Ambidexterity, and went at it for another 15 mins:<br>
<br>
706 hits (9615 damage)<br>
349 misses<br>
-----------<br>
1055 swings<br>
<br>
So:<br>
<br>
Ambidexterity in this case gave me 11.8% more swings with the offhand.<br>
<br>
The damage increase of the offhand alone was 4.2%. <br>

<br>
Ambidex is the best by far for any raiding rogue....the rest......ouch....<br>
<br>
I suggested this on the NewAA skill thread already and here is the game mechanics Idea from my post....and idea that I'd like peoples opinions on since I've seen ALOT of complaints about our arch skills....heck even in PoP this would be nice.<br>
<br>
In terms of effectiveness vs being too good, I think a Crippling Backstab as originally proposed would be reasonable, but base the dmg on the Initiating rogues attack.<br>
<br>
4 - 5 Times Atk would yield average results from 4400 (unbuffed rogue with lowish str at 60) to 8500 (buffed with Savagry et all with a max modifier of x5 dmg applied) make it a discipline timer (so It could NOT be stacked with Duelist damage or used consecutively with duelist) and allow crits to apply. Also make it require combat fury 3.<br>
<br>
So for approximately the cost of manaburn rogues could use every 144 minutes a skill that allowed them to do:<br>
<br>
4400 - 8500 dmg non crit<br>
or<br>
7500 - 14500 dmg critical<br>
<br>
That seems to be quite in par with our existing dmg output with duelist and primals factored in. Code it to do dmg to the rogue equal to half of his current hit points and it would be a sufficient balance to the dmg. The taunt on 14500 dmg when your suddenly at half health would be a significant overcompensation for it. <br>
<br>
Manaburn is feasible on pvp servers and isn't utterly overbalanced. This would be a similar improvement to the interest of rogue skills as finishing moves and only work out to a 1.7 DPS dmg change overall per reuse period at its highest critical level. <br>
<br>
All in all a reasonable suggestion.<br>
<br>
