I just find that boring. I hunt in small packs with my guild (two groups of six, one 50 skald in each).

I can jumpstart you with some goodies.<br><br>EDIT: I have trouble with slash nightshades on Merlin. It comes down to who hits who first. I lose often if alone. Buffed? Forget it. I don't use a bot and I'm brutalized when I opponent does. Nothing new there.<br><br>As far as dropping stealth: its a flavor thing. I also scout often (RR and Guild keep taking fun) and my stealth is base 36 (wish I had taken 34). I DO NOT like to be found. I suppose you could drop it a few points for some more envenom but LA or Axe addition is, imo, not worth the return investment as there are plenty of items to round your melee skills beyond 50. Although not confirmed by myself just yet, apparently there is a new ring that grants +2 to envenom in the new dungeon on the front.

Also, I'm not (quite) yet 50, so maybe this will change since Stealth detection is based on the level of the person looking.. and I'm usually going against 50 Infils or Nightshades (don't seem to have a problem with lower-level assassins).<br><br>Bedevere/Midgard has a growing population (we were lagging behind Alb/Hib pretty badly in numbers, but we're tough as nails <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), we would definitely welcome another friendly face. If you start up on Bed, send me a /tell in game (my handle is halfhand there too) and I can hook you up with some cash/PLing love.. would be good to have another Safehouse'er around. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>EDIT:<br><br>I just took a look at the catacombs builder, this spec does seem to be a better utilization of points (very close to the one listed above):<br><br>L50 (final):<br><br>Stealth 35<br>Axe 41<br>LA 46<br>CS 10<br>Envenom 35<br><br>... 1 point left over at 50 (nice!).<br><br>Wonder what difference you'd see between 46 LA/41 Axe and 44 LA/43 Axe?

You'll just need to spot them at range and enter combat mode directly the second you see them (blows their perf).  Auto-train stealth to 44, Stealth 34, Enven 36, Axe 44, LAxe 44, CS 12 (left overs).<br><br>Items for Stealth and Envenom are easy +11.  You'll have about +6-8 in crit without even trying (on epic, etc.), and with spell crafting you'll have main Wep +6 Axe, +5 Left Axe, and on off-hand +5 Axe +6 Left Axe.  And yes... you will be tearing Infs/NS toons new holes if they don't perf and Buffs/RRs are equal.  Just need to find some decent Thrust resists (very hard to find in Mid!).  Gogo gadget spellcrafting.  You'll replace the epic gloves/boots prolly with +hits and +thrust resists... there's some wasted Dex in there somewhere too that you can exchange for STR/CON that you'll need.  Make a Norse and put in +10 STR/CON/QUICK.<br><br>Good luck, I'd like to respec SZ too cause Crits are blowing chuncks but already used my respec.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ( <p><BR>Steppin Razor, BORS/Mid - Lvl 50 5-spec SB (Flammen Vakten)<BR>Nerf Buffbots<BR>http://www.geocities.com/nage42/Steppin_Razor.html<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/umaladon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/2/02 11:33:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4207.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shadowzerker (with self BT buster)-would love feedback</span><hr size=1> I'd go with this setup if you're basing it on RR4 (+3)<br><br>Stealth - 35<br>CS - 11 (you have 14 points leftover so I put some here)<br>Axe - 42<br>Left Axe - 44<br>Envenom - 36<br><br>I think you get more value out of your spec points getting Envenom to 50 instead of getting a few extra levels of Axe/LA.
