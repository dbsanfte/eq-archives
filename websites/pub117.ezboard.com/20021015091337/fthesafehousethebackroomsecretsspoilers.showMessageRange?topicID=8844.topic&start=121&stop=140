I mean...<br>
<br>
Chaotic stab - What good is it? Especially when it only guarantees minimum BS dmg? Perhaps if it gave you the ability to do normal BS dmg from the front, then it might be in line with some of the other class abilities... but minimum? <br>
so we're gonna get ~95 guaranteed stab frrom the front at 60... and as it is, <br>
you'll prolly be doing normal stabs for 90+. The point of this ability is?<br>
<br>
Double Repost - Now there's a skill we'll use a lot. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought the idea was to evade, stay low on argo, be the unseen power of the fight. This will only take you higher on argo, and kill you faster with you lower hp &amp; ac. Why would VI give us a skill that we &quot;shouldn't&quot; need to ever use?<br>
<br>
Ambi - One of the few ones that look like they might be worth something.<br>
<br>
Escape - Yay! we finally get FD... too bad you have to wait for 72 min to use it again.<br>
<br>
Acrobatics - Is falling &amp; taking damage really an issue at lvl 60? Wow... I never knew this would be an important thing to have... (sarcasm)<br>
<br>
ATN - Not bad, but shouldn't this be attained around 55? Not really the &quot;uber skill&quot; it may seem to be at 60. Not to many guilds goto places that require this skill... and they certainly don't take too many rogues along.<br>
<br>
Purge poison - oooooo....eeeeee.....ahhhhhhh... How many time a month do you get into a situation you need this one? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You won't get normal bs from the front ever.  It would be unbalancing.  As for the actual use of this skill, you're right.  An extra stab for 120 dmg at lvl60 every 6 seconds isn't a lot.  Still haven't heard if assassinate works from the front with this.<br>

My sentiments exactly.  If im holding agro long enough to actually see this skill working, im 1/2 dead already.  Basically, VI didn't have anything else to give us that didn't overpower us so this is what we got.<br>

At max double attack, parsing shows that you're already doing a very high % of succesful double attacks.  It is useful but not by much.<br>

And too bad see invis mobs will STILL attack you after you escaped if they see you. Usefulness is very limited.<br>

The only area off the top of my head where this would be useful is pulling spiders in velks.  Other than that, it's useless.<br>

It would be handy if our trap skills worked better.  Most people consider them broken or useless. I have found them pretty useful at times.  I would like this skill to increase the disarmed time of traps to like 72 game hours.  Ever been in a LD group in velks and having to click your disarm button constantly? And what's with the inability to detect/disarm those friggin annoying spawn triggers?? (e.g. mind worms)<br>

Pretty useless.  It would be a lot more useful if the reuse timer was lowered or if it increased natural svP by a certain %.   Take those skill points and increase your natural svP instead.<br>

perhaps I'm not reading correctly.  I'm reading this skill gives us a guaranteed BS... even if in front.  To me that rocks.  Now, does this guaranteed double BS or just 1? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uvenvensilentdagger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venven Silentdagger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/30/02 6:45:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=127>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Just 1 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/unalayniapendlehaven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nalaynia Pendlehaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 10:07:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Hmm I guess Im the weird rogue then..

Granted it may not make a difference when mobs are quad 900+, but I love running around 3k+ hp unbuffed and 5k+ on raids. I would consider regen as a thing I would do later on after I have the pts I want in HP raising and combat Stability.  But thats just me, Im not saying anybody is wrong.

NOPE.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
he was at 184.  I was at 184 after the burst of skills that followed level 52.  Between that burst and the burst that came with level 53 i saw no rises in 1000ish bind wound attempts.  Ya that many (thats a _low_ number to keep me in the believable).  I even bug reported it.  But i saw 3 rises the day i leveled so i think its not a bug.  But im back to no rises.  (already did atleast 10 stacks of bandaids)  All first aid does is make it clear there is a &quot;soft cap&quot; to bindwound rises that is much worse then the actual level based hard cap. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/uoakfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>oakfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/5/02 9:46:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=131>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> escape = uber</span><hr size=1> Somebody said...<br>

&quot;Escape: no offense we got the shaft here. it should be 3 skill levels, 3 points each maybe, and the timer should decrease 72, 36, 18. Keep in mind if this is absolutly identical to feign death, that we are only hidden after we use it, unlike monks who are feigned. So even if we completly wipe agro, the mob is just going to reaggro us if we are near to it and our 72 minutes is down the toilet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Horse apples.  If I understand the way this works, Escape requires NO skill checks for success (unlike FD) so essentially it works 100% of the time.  Obviously if you choose to use it under the nose of a mob that sees hide, you've made a poor choice, and you will die having blown a 72 minute reuse skill to no good effect.<br>
<br>
I can't believe so many people think all our class skills are stupid / useless / mere eye candy.  Just because you can't see how to use it doesn't make it useless.<br>

I have not yet seen it in action but this makes me wonder what 'Minimal'  actually means. Is it really the minimum? or is it just low end dmg? that 120 every 6 seconds was 60-90 before so the few extra dmg is neglegible BUT if its 150 or 200ish that would actually be nice. and for someone who can BS for 500+ then 150-200 is minimal I think.<br>
<br>
First Aid~ Allows you to bandage 10, 20, and 30% above your present cap. If you are not level 57+ with 201 BindWound then you will only be able to go to 80%.<br>
Once my Bind went up to 201 (level 57) i started getting 84hp per bandage and could go to 70% and with 3skill in FirstAid it lets me bind up to 100% but still at 84hp per bandage.<br>

Does the % increase come from your Base hps, or is it dependent on your stamina as well?<br>
<br>
IE:<br>
if you had 2k hps with no gear on and 100 sta, You would now have 2200 with 10% increase.<br>
<br>
But if you put gear on to get to say 200 sta, you would have 2300 before the 10%, so would you have, 2530 after?<br>
<br>
Just wondering if the bonus is reflectef of your base hps or after stamina is taken into account?<br>
<br>
Edit: also would HP items get added into the % increase as well?  Easy way to tell would be if you equip a 100 hp item do you go up by 110 hps... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ulomack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lomack</A> at: 2/8/02 1:42:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ul0z.showPublicProfile?language=EN>L0z</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 9:54:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8844.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue Alternate Advancement</span><hr size=1> Durability increases your hps based on 2 things:<br>

My advise would be not to buy this skill unless you have points to waste.<br>
<br>
Personally I think that this skill should be removed and replaced with a skill that reduces the recycle time for backstabs. Backstab damage has not gone up since the introduction of RB, but overall melee damage has taken a great leap since then. This has marginalized the importance of the backstab component to a rogue's overall damage output.<br>

On my quest for Ambidexterity and Chaiotic Stab im currently working through the Arch. abilities.  Im about to come up on my 13-16 point region, and im wondering what might be best to go with?<br>
<br>
a: Combat Stability 1 and Combat Agility 1<br>
b: Natural Durability 2<br>
c: Combat Fury 2<br>
d: Finishing Blow 2<br>

I'm leaning toward option A, because while I never try to solo or tank if I can help it, I somehow seem to be in that position a bunch.<br>

<br>
3 into runspeed<br>
3 into regen<br>
1 in CF<br>
1 into finishing blow (just for the hell of it, seems to work on a lot of stuff, havent noticed any level limit yet)<br>
2 into combat agility.<br>
<br>
which brings me to a total of 16 points. Now I'm not sure where I want to go from here. Durability seems to have pretty small returns (though at lvl 3 dura will take my unbuffed hps right now from 2130ish to 2350ish, 200hps isnt bad).<br>
<br>
The one I'm curious about is combat stability. This sounds like more of a warrior thing obviously, and being a rogue, if dozekar is gonna take a swipe at me for 900, 2% of mitigation isnt really gonna do diddly for me. However when exping it might be handy when you need to tank a little. <br>
<br>
Regen seems wonky, 1 pt of regen for each of 2/4/6 pts put into it? Very small returns for the effort imho. Fear resist, I rarely get feared as it is, so I'm in no hurry for this. Finishing blow, while neat, is just a toy. I don't really regret the 1 point I put in it, but I can't see putting any more in anytime soon.<br>
<br>
So that pretty much narrows it down to: lvl 2 crits, lvl 1 mitigation, lvl 3 agility, or lvl 1 durability. Think I might go for mitigation/durability, as I wanna spend my next 2 points quick, im itching for the veteran title :><br>
