After clearing the plane and all the golems, we were finally ready to face the faceless himself.  We had about 39-40 people for the fight, and we all buffed up and went to the pull spot along the wall.  When he was in camp all the tanks seemed to be feared from his proc thing, and we only got him to 80% hp before wiping.  It was a ton of fun, and good for our first try, but does anyone have advice please on how to kill him?  Do we need more tanks and healers maybe?  Is there a certain strat to use other than ch rotations?<br>My spells and the other casters spells were hitting pretty well, but I think a few more wizards wouldn't hurt.

Might as well just figure that you have 1 tank feared at all times.  It's really easy to keep a defensive tank alive against him with only 2 clerics healing that tank.  So...<br><br>What's always worked best in my experience is setting up a couple of folks as the MTs and have a couple of clerics focusing on each one of them.  Then have a single cleric assigned to rampage duty and keep the rampage tank alive (he doesn't rampage that often).<br><br>The more often your MT and RT resist fear, the easier it will be to keep them alive and conserve cleric mana.  So beef up their MR, and make sure they make effective use of instant click items (same goes for anyone else who will be meleeing him...).  Work on positioning your tanks in a spot where they are backed up against the wall and the knockback won't move them.  This will help a ton with controlling who he's beating on.<br><br>Manage that effectively and it's a pretty straightforward fight from there on out.<br><br>He will also proc an AE snare like every 12 or 20 secs or so... this will overwrite jboots.  So everyone with jboots should put them up in the first slot.  Once his snare lands, boot icon is replaced with snare, next AE he will dispel it, you click on boots again.  This makes the fight a lot less of a pain in the ass for most melees.  (make sure they have levitate, too!)<br><br>I'm sure there's much better strats out there, but I hope this gives you some useable ideas! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub35.ezboard.com/ufendien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fendien</A>&nbsp;

I've tanked CT 2 times since patch and with 400ish mr only got feared once, maybe twice per fight, and for short durations at that. You don't need two tanks, its very very easy to stick him on one even with fear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/ukrimziniv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KrimzinIV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/29/02 10:41:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11734.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Best thing ive seen</span><hr size=1> Pull him up into top of the temple and have tanks double shrunk corner him and have clerics outside the back wall 1 floor down. most of the time they wont even get hit with the AE knockback and when the tank gets fear'd hes stuck in the corner and just walks against the corner so he wont go out of melee range and CT will stay on him.

There is a good tree (think the second tree) on the north wall that you can put your back to and you won't move.  At that point it is all about your other melee NOT PUSHING HIM TOO FAR.  Just PIN him to the wall and keep him there.  When I got feared, I'd still be hit and the fight went on.<br><br>Got a question though, sometimes, very rarely, the debuff will take a different buff instead of the first buff.  Anyone know what causes this?  Usually it is always first buff with CT, but sometimes.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#3B3B3B><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/ukalcor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalcor </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/02 4:07:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11734.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best thing ive seen</span><hr size=1> his ae snare (debuff as you call it) will overwrite jboots, no matter what slot it is in.. thats why you keep jboots first slot always. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub117.ezboard.com/ualderianstormguarddr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alderian Stormguard DR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/02 10:30:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11734.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best thing ive seen</span><hr size=1> Uhhh, no Kalcor.
