The herbalist emerged from his smoky room, eyes glazed over, asking "Hey mannn, what's all the fuss?" Asked at knifepoint about the hidden hallway, the herbalist responded, "You keep your herbs down there mannn".  Sadly, the herbalist was so stoned he didn't see the blade bearing down on him. His bowl hit the floor with a clatter and alerted the guards. <br><p><br>From everywhere royal guards, sorcerers, and judicators of Di'zok flocked to the invaders for the uber lewt they were rumored to drop. The King came out to see what all the ruckus was. The PCs fought bravely, and one of the last shouts they heard from a Royal Guard was "King needs a REZ plz…are there any rezzing Sarnak Templars in zone?" <br>LOADING….PLEASE WAIT<br><p><br>The guards quickly looted the PCs corpses, only to have to face the wrath of the Queen.  The guards had not asked permission to loot these Epic Uber PC drops. "How often do I get a chance at MFH??" her shrill voice rang thru the halls. "Once a year?? My set of PC Muppet Collectibles is almost complete! I deserve it more than you!" and she promptly fired all the guards.<br><p><br>Less than two hours later, the now unemployed guards assisted the PCs back down, gave them their lewt, and laughed when yet again the zone echoed with "King needs a REZ plz!!"<br><p><br><center><br><i>Congrats to our clerics who got their notes today =)</i><br><center></p>

Clerics of Innoruuk invited to perform the ceremony declined, stating they'd rather die than perform such unholy matrimony. Muppets were only too happy to oblige. Chesse is taking Bearjangles' surname, much to the relief of reporters and to the sorrow of broken window fixers.
