<FONT FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial" SIZE="3"><B>The fall of Warlord Skarlon</B>
<P><BR><P><FONT FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial" SIZE="2">
<p>Twas a night like any other night for five fine adventurers of the fiftieth rank.  Ahh yes and poor Ulthan as well, the cleric of fourty fifth rank who was unfortunate enough to cast his lot with us.  We had heard rumors of fire giants and wondered where they might be.  So we did what any group of hearty adventurers must.  We set out to investigate this infestation.</p>

<p>We set down through the insects and fought our way down, easily clearing a path through the evil creatures.  Our monks, Jedii and Jeffx, having been buffed by our trusty shaman Shalea (Jedii's fiancee) and the clerics, easily lured the beasties out to their impending doom while Serena, myself, and Ulthan kept our eyes on their health.  Unfortunately at this time our bonds to the world of Norrath weakened (A third of the server went LD), with the exception of Jeffx, who was forced to feign death, who had to watch as the rest of our mindless bodies were overrun by the hordes of crawlers and beetles.  Four adventurers of rank fifty met their demise, and one of fourty five.  I myself was demoted to the rank of forty-nine, cursing the gods of Norrath for their ill timing.</p>

<p>As our bonds to Norrath resolidified and we came to our senses at our home points, we picked up reinforcements in the form of Cros, a fiftieth rank druid, Taoism a fourty-fourth rank monk, and Donzi a fourty-fourth rank warrior.  We returned to our corpses and Serena and I ressurected the crew, reattaining my rank of fifty in the process.  Unfortunately, Ulthan's corpse was no where to be seen, and we had to continue with him borrowing a mace and tunic from my inventory.</p>

<p>We worked our way to the fire giant castle and the monks began luring them out one at a time to kill them.  These were of the rank of fifty one to fifty two as they looked like they would wipe the floor with those of us who were fiftieth rank.  Quite a few fights ensued, being a reasonable challenge for our small band.  After the guards were dispatched, Jeffx went in after the king and was luring the poor giant out when the king become wise to our ploy.  Rather than being slaughtered by our adventurers, the fire giant king slew himself and left his warlord, Skarlon, to defend his castle.</p>

<p>Warlord Skarlon was a mighty foe, asking what our tombstone's would like to say, but we pressed on with the fight.  Ulthan, Serena, and I healing as the monks and Donzi beat on him.  Cros let fly the stinging nettles, crud, and natures wrath, getting a bit too much of the warlord's attention.  Our cleric's healed the mighty druid in the nick of time.  We had a few close calls, but in the end were able to watch the red giant fall.</p>

<p>We went in to find the throne of the fire giant castle deserted, and paused for a few moments rest.  Cros decreed that the mighty Nagafen was close and a roar amoung our band voiced the wish to pursue the dragon of flame.  Unfortunately, Donzi and Shalea needed to depart Norrath, so we could not press the fight any longer...</p>
