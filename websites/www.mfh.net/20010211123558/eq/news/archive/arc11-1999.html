<!--
This is the NewsPro archive file template. This will be used to generate all your monthly archive
files. It should be a basic HTML page, except you may insert the following special commands anywhere
in this file:
<Insert!Date> Inserts the month of the archive.
<Insert!News> Inserts the archived news (pretty useless if you don't include this).
IMPORTANT: The ! in the example above was inserted so that the example wouldn't be confused by
the script with the actual command. Remove the exclamation marks from the example when using
those commands.
