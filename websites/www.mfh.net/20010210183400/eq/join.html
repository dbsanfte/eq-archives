<FONT FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial" COLOR="#0099CC">Guess I should state a little about our history.

<P>
MFH started a few years ago when I was playing a turn based paper game at a game convention in LA.  Since then it has been on and off a few times. Sometime in 1997 me and a few people from work found UO. We wanted to start a guild, because we all had the same values.

<P>
Somehow, I was picked as guildmaster.  I still don't know why, but I THINK it had something to do with the fact I can talk my way outta most situations.  We wrestled with a few different names, and then I remembered MFH. I suggested it, and everyone (almost) agreed. 

<P>
This marked the first time there was more live members of MFH besides me.  Since that time, MFH has been in Diablo, QuakeII,  QuakeIII, Tribes, Rouge Spear, Halflife, and EQ.  (BTW we kicked SO much tail in QII and Tribes.)  No guild can be run by one person alone though. There HAS to be a council.  After thinking it over, I decided that the people that helped make MFH an actual multi-game guild should be the ones to help run it (HA! Thats what ye get for making me Guildmaster! hehe)

<P>
The senior council of MFH consits of:<br>

<UL>
    <LI>Fozzy - Guildmaster
    <LI>Aarich
    <LI>Murman (Yanaden)
    <LI>Neandra    
    <LI> Rowabi (Roshambo, Wasabi, Allmighty--whichever his ego picks that day :) )
</UL>

<UL>
    <LI>Anyone wanting to join MFH because we have alot of high members and will do well in PVP combat, get lost.  We WILL PVP someday, but we're here to quest for glory man.
<P>
    <LI>Anyone looking to have a "Big Brother" to scare others, or be a bully, etc, get lost.   You'll find out real quick that I dont take action against anyone without doing A LOT of research.  If I find that a member lied to me, or "used" the guild as leverage against another player for personal gain, they are GONE.
<P>
    <LI>Want to meet some fun, funny, creative people? Want to go in search of adventure? Want to help others in need? Come on in.
<P>
    <LI>Bottom line: NO k00l d00ds, NO LaMeRs, NO AsShOlEs.
<P>
    <LI>Dont try to hard either. We almost never let random people in. Every current member has a specific tie to someone else, or has made a really good impression on a current member.
</UL>

<P>Probably the best way for you to make sure you are NEVER invited, is to keep bugging me in tells. I dont know about the other members (but id say they feel the same), but when im IN game, im there to play. I am now ignoring all tells to me about membership. But if I remember you, or you keep persting me, if you ever do get sponsored, ill deny ya for it. Sorry, but this has become a big problem.

<OL><FONT FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial" SIZE="2"  COLOR="#DCDCDC">
    <LI>First off, you need to get someone to sponsor you. That person must already be in the guild.  That means you have to meet someone in the guild, and let him/her get to know you. Don't try this with me. I get WAY to many tells as it is.  Better yet, try to get more than one person to meet ya. The more that know you, the better your chances are.<P>Once you done the above, ask the people you know if you could join. It's up to them to post a message about it on the message board. Once done, the voting will begin.

<P>
    <LI>Minimum level requirement of level 15 into the guild. This is to prevent people that want to be in to get stuff. Leachers in other 
words. 

<P>
    <LI>If sponsored person does not get the required 20% of votes within 2 weeks, the request is closed. In this case, a person is eligible for future sponsorship again.

<P>
    <LI>Here are the rules and guidelines on what happens after you are sponsored:
    <P>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entry into the guild has the following limits:  

    <UL>
            <LI>20% of ALL members must approve.
            <LI>50% of officers must approve people as well.
            <LI>Votes can no longer be of the type "Well i trust 's judgment, so i vote yes."
            <LI>Votes must have a reason behind them in other words.
            <LI>A single NO vote from anyone will stop membership in its tracks.
            <LI>The senior council can make a 4/4 vote to add people. In this case the 20% of member vote is not needed.
<P>
            <LI>One vote from any member still enough to prevent entry into guild.   In this case sponsored person is not eligible to be re-sponsored into the guild. (With special exceptions from 4/4 council members).
 </UL>    
       
 <P>
    <LI>New voted in members are in a "probation period" for 30 days. If a member has a problam with a probie in the 30 day period, a member can at thier dicression send any officer an email with the issue. These issues will most likely result in the removal of the probie from the guild.

<P>    
    <UL>
        <LI><B>Probies cannot sponsor people into the guild.</B>
        <LI><B>Probies do not gain access to the "New Member/Voting booth during their first 30 days.</B>
        <LI>It is up to the member to contact myself or Neandra after 30 days to have rights granted to the voting booth.
     </UL>

<P>
    <LI>If you get voted in, you're still not done though. If you haven't already done so, you MUST go to the message board and REGISTER on it. Its the only way we can give you access to the private areas.
<P>
    <LI><B>YOU HAVE TO SEND AN EMAIL TO FOZZY@FOZ.COM</B>
<P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Email should have MFH in the subject.
            <LI>Line 1 should have your CHARACTER NAME.
            <LI>Line 2 should have your EMAIL ADDRESS.
            <LI>Line 3 should have your RACE/CLASS AND CURRENT LEVEL INFO.
            <LI>Line 4 should have your MFH BULLETIN BOARD NAME         
        </UL>

<P>
That outta do it.

When your rights are done, and youve been accepted, please make a post in the private area, and introduce yourself/say hi to everyone.<BR>

Then, go to the Rules and Guidelines Forum and the topic "Conduct of a Muppet". Follow the link in that topic and read the conduct page.<br>
If you dont agree with whats written there, remove yourself from the guild. Seriously. If you agree, post your agreement, and start being a Muppet :)<BR>


<P>Donate 100 plat to the guild. Yeah right. hehe. There are no dues, no chores, no tasks.  At certain points members WILL post a request for something. All i ask is that if you can, TRY TO HELP YOUR GUILDMATES.

<P>When all is done, you will get an email back from me welcoming you to the guild. If you don't, you have missed a step somewhere. Or I just forgot to reply to ya ;) Check the general board to see if you've been tweaked.  We usually leave a little welcome note there.
