Wouldn’t it be great if it were that easy? But it ain’t, kids. It’s about as 
easy as explaining why Star Wars Episode 2 had enough redeeming qualities to 
make Episode 3 worth seeing. Maybe easier, because that is almost an 
impossibility. But I digress… <br>
<br>
In fact, getting to where we are now, Phase 5 in the Plane of Time, has been one 
of the biggest pains in the ass I could possibly imagine. A bigger pain in the 
ass than unwanted anal sex from a strange cowboy that you met in a dumpster. But 
I egress… <br>
<br>

<img src="http://ghguild.com/forum/upfiles/40/4713F2D76F54417DA233667C0C175E88.jpg"><br>
<br>
WHY is it such a pain in the ass you ask? In the first place, you gotta kill 
practically every single mob in the game a few thousand times to be high enough 
LEVEL to be able to get to the bosses of the zones that let you START the quest 
to get into Time. Then after killing the bosses for YOU, you have to kill them 
again for all your guildmates. Again and again and again it seems. It’s like an 
episode of Dawson’s Creek; it never seems to end. But I undress… <br>
<br>
And sometimes you have to go with OTHER people and kill those boss mobs when 
your guild isn’t doing it for what seems like the five billionth time. That can 
be a blessing or a curse. A blessing because once you have that flag, you don’t 
have to go again. A curse because sometimes those other guilds are completely 
incompetent to the degree you may seriously consider looking on their guild 
website to see if they have instructions on how to wipe their own asses. Not 
always… some guilds are full of great talent and good people… but some….yeesh.
<br>
So…after you kill those bosses it unlocks OTHER zones with OTHER bosses you have 
to kill that unlocks even MORE zones and bosses. Finally, in about 6 years, you 
are down to four bosses that allow you access to the Plane of It’s About Fucking 
Time. <br>
<br>
Fennin Ro (anagrammed out to Infernno) God of Fire <br>
If you do this guy right, it’s pretty bloody easy. One misstep and easy becomes 
“CONSENT YOUR ROGUES PLEASE” very quickly. And your first couple of times are 
just one giant misstep after another. Don’t feel bad, everyone screws this one 
up a few times. Beyond that I might recommend practicing in Blackburrow or 
something. <br>
<br>
Xegony (anagrammed out to Oxygen) God of Air <br>
This bitch is fun fun fun. Not only do you have to kill her, you have to kill 
all her happy little munchkins that she initializes as she dies. Not incredibly 
difficult, but not as easy as one might think if you have your head in your ass 
as much as some people seem to. <br>
<br>
Avatar of Earth (anagrammed out to Avatar of Earth) Earth guy…thing... <br>
Bring PLENTY of Clerics, tanks and Enchanters and Rogues and Rangers and Druids 
and …. well hell… bring a LOT of everything. And then block out about 30 hours 
to do it. Good luck! <br>
<br>
Coirnav (anagrammed out to Bitchface) God of Water <br>
Easily my most hated and most loved boss mob in the game. Hated because this 
event is a BITCH to kill and it kept us from Time for awhile. Loved because it’s 
keeping everyone ELSE from Time too. I can describe this event easily; 15 
minutes of total concentration and luck. Bon Apetit! <br>
OK so now once you kill all these four mobs you have to go make this stupid 
thing that is comprised of uber rare items (rare enough that Night Eternal 
bought one piece from us for 700,000 plat…which we turned around and divided up 
with every member online as a happy 10k gift per person) that combine to make a 
bag to make the part that you use to go to a zone that lets you into another 
zone that lets you into the zone you WANT to be in. Sound confusing? Try DOING 
it. <br>
<br>
Ok so once you GET to the zone you want to be in (Time), you gotta do all these 
silly events called PHASES. I'm not going to go into detail on the phases 
because I want you to figure it out like we did. But anyway once you get to a 
Phase called Phase 4, you have to kill the SAME FUCKING GODS YOU JUST KILLED NOT 
LONG AGO. WTF!!! And now…to add flavor…you are timed in your attempts. <br>
<br>
Killing two of them in Phase 4 isn’t that bad. But the last two…holy shit on a 
stick. They have been the bane of our existence for awhile. And we all know…when 
things are great, people are happy and fun and full of energy. When they are bad 
though…people leave the guild, they leave the game, they start watching fucking 
TV instead of playing in the raid, they AFK for HOURS at a time (I mean this 
literally, too). And some people pull the best thing of all…they assume you are 
a bunch of fucking idiots and try to tell you, the very same people that helped 
GET THEM WHERE THEY ARE, what the fuck is up. EVERY SINGLE ARMCHAIR ADMIRAL 
thinks they know it all, and it pisses me off. Enough that I have a little rant 
about it below. In the key of F minor. <br>
<br>
Let me give you a hint about something in life, kids. If you are unwilling to 
publicly stand up and HELP lead then sit the fuck down, and shut the fuck up. NO 
ONE WANTS TO HEAR IT unless you are willing to risk failure too. Because that’s 
what leaders do…we let EVERYONE take the credit when things go good, and assume 
all the blame when they go wrong. Sitting back in your little armchair, where 
you think you have all the answers and everyone else is a dumbshit because they 
aren’t following your master plan that you probably got off the fucking internet 
from some whacked out crack addict ANYWAY is about as stupid and arrogant a 
thing as I can imagine. And I can imagine A LOT. <br>
<br>
So sit back and enjoy the ride or help drive this crazy bus (help means being a 
part of the team, not assuming you have all the answers). Everyone is important 
in events this big, and if everyone does their part, amazing things can happen. 
If you are not the leading type, that’s ok. We want you here just as much as 
anyone. If you ARE the leader type, we appreciate and relish your help. But if 
you think you know it all and refuse to lift a finger other than to backstab, 
politic, and just basically make everyone else out to be idiots…then I have a 
nice warm cup of STFU waiting for you near the door. The same door that’s gonna 
hit you on the ass very soon… \<p>More pics:</p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today on MSP’s Wild Kingdom: The Idiot: Why are 
you such a fucking idiot? A scientific study in idiocy. <br>
<br>
Is there some reward you get at the end of your life for being the biggest 
possible idiot imaginable? Is there something in the Bible that says you get to 
go bowling with Jesus if you rank as high as possible on the MSP Idiot Scale ™ ? 
There must be, because there are so many idiots running rampant in EQ alone that 
I am starting to believe I'm either an alien, a super-genius, or I missed the 
biggest, most important memo, ever created. <br>
<br>
Idiots vary by degrees. <br>
<br>
Take what I call the “low level idiot”. This is a relatively harmless animal 
that normally resides under a rock. They are just generally clueless, but don’t 
bite, mostly because no one told them they have teeth and they were too stupid 
to figure it out without a self-help video tape full of really annoyingly cute 
animals. They are the people that die in water zones EVERY 20 MINUTES because 
they haven’t yet found that you can buy a water-breathing device for almost 
nothing in the Bazaar. <br>
<br>
Then comes the dreaded WDIDI (pronounced wah dee dee) which translates to “What 
do I do idiot”. These are fearsome creatures that creep up on you in the night. 
A Cleric who thinks he is a Wizard, a Druid who never realized that Druids can 
heal or buff, or a Warrior who is completely oblivious to the fact that they can 
taunt mobs.   </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imagine a young dragon with all the power 
dragons have. HUGE amounts of power. Now… imagine that dragon as a teenager who 
is SERIOUSLY fucking high out of his skull. I mean, whacked beyond the ability 
to reason. Now take that same dragon, loaded out of his mind, and convince him 
to go fuck up some knights at the local Knight Convention at the Howard 
Johnson’s. THIS is what a WDIDI is like. Absolute idiocy. Fear the Wahdeedee!
<br>
<br>
Here is a quick idiot guide. If you answer yes to any of these questions, you 
are more than likely an idiot. <br>
<br>
1) Do you wake up in a new guild monthly? <br>
2) Is drama the key focus in your life? <br>
3) Do people have to constantly remind you what your class does? <br>
4) Have you ever wandered aimlessly through a zone, looking for your raid, 
dragging a massive train behind you that kills everyone? <br>
5) Have you been unable to figure out that you can DOWNLOAD ALMOST ALL IN-GAME 
MAPS FOR FREE OFF THE INTERNET? <br>
6) Do you randomly go AFK while you are fighting a boss mob? <br>
7) Do you see LOADING PLEASE WAIT…. more often than you gain experience? <br>
8) Have you feigned death during a duel, thinking your opponent would fall for 
it? <br>
9) Have you ever intentionally done absolutely nothing at a raid hoping no one 
would notice? (we do) <br>
10) Do you guild hop like a rabbit on crack thinking none of the guild 
leaders/officers on the server talk amongst ourselves and compare notes on what 
a fucking idiot you are? (we do) <br>
11) Do you drive slow in the fast lane, thinking “I pay for these roads too” not 
realizing you are impeding traffic, and that if shooting people was legal there 
would be one less asshole like you on the road? <br>
12) Do you call the wrong number FOUR TIMES IN A ROW? <br>
13) Do people look at you and shake their heads a lot? <br>
14) Have you ever wondered if you are an idiot? (trick question… intelligent 
people care if they look like idiots, while idiots are completely fucking 
oblivious) <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, I almost forgot…we killed The Rathe Council and Coirnav. We got into Plane 
of Time or whatever those damned kids call it these days. <br>
<br>
/shrug   </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">OK, let's catch up on pictures:</font><br><br>
This is Xegony, Note that one of her is crying. That is the Xegony closest to Nedd.<br>
<img src="http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/pets.jpg"><br><br>
<br>
This is a wood dude from Ragrax, Council of the Mustard (or whatever you crazy kids call it)
<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/wood%20dude.jpg><br>
<br><br>
This is a whole lot of them.  They are in a circle jerk I think.  I didn’t ask.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/rathe.jpg><br><br>
<br>
This is a dead Avatar of Dirt.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/earthdead.jpg><br><br>
<br>
This is Coirnav. We killed him.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/coirnav.jpg><br><br>
<br>
This is what you see when you first go into the Plane of Time. Yeah, I was confused as hell too.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/time%201.jpg><br><br>
<br>
After that, you see there are happy "themes" around Time. It's like Disneyland except you kill things. Here is Winter!<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/winter%20time.jpg><br><br>
<br>
Here is Summer! I love this season.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/summer%20time.jpg><br><br>
<br>
and Spring!<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/spring%20time.jpg><br><br>
<br>
And here is my favorite season... ROCK.<br>
