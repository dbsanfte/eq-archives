You know what really pisses me off? Ok… I admit… a LOT of things piss me off. 
But today, I want to talk about drivers. Other people who drive usually piss me 
off.<br>
<br>
I admit it, I drive relatively fast. Not like “push it to the floor” fast, but 
more like “as fast as it looks like I can travel within reason” fast. The speed 
limit here on freeways is 60. So I go 65-70. But there always has to be some 
stupid motherfucker right in front of me that has decided that 60 really means 
“between 45 and 55 as long as I stay in the fast lane”.<br>
<br>
Why the fuck is it that these people seem to drive in front of me every single 
fucking night I go home? I think it’s a conspiracy of some kind. But I am 
working on fixing it. I have developed a rather attractive steel and aluminum 
hat that I wear now to ward off any of these conspirators reading my mind so 
they don’t know when I'm going to travel. NO LONGER will I be stopped from 
getting home in time to make raids into Vex Thall, or Solusek Ro (WE KILLED THAT 
MOTHERFUCKER SO SWEET).<br>
<br>
But maybe by announcing “Mr Deathray Stopper” (what I call my cool hat) I have 
just fucked myself and they will figure out a way to read my mind anyway. Or 
maybe they will just post spies like they used to when I wore all polyester 
suits for those 6 months (polyester isn’t as good as aluminum foil but it LOOKS 
good in greens and browns). YEAH I SAW YOUR SPIES! YOU CAN’T FOOL ME! HAHA!<br>
<br>
SITTING UP THERE PRETENDING TO BE COPS OR JOGGERS OR TELEPHONE REPAIRMEN OR OLD 
LADIES WALKING DOGS! Ok, yeah, the COP was real. I found that out when I started 
throwing things at him and yelling “I SEE YOU, YOU SPYING MOTHERFUCKER! HERE! 
SPY ON THIS FUCKING ROCK! HAHA! HEY! SPIES GET HANDCUFFS? WHAT THE FUCK?” I 
think he was a GOVERNMENT spy though, to be fair. <br>
<br>
But that old lady spy was cute. HER ROBOT DOG WENT DOWN! DOWN LIKE A…well a dead 
dog I guess. It must have been very sophisticated technology.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yeah… I hate people who drive slow, man. They piss 
me off.<br>

ASK MR. SMARTYPANTS<br>

Dear MSP, <br>
<br>
Do you think that current state of sociological public policy in this country 
sufficiently takes into account the ramifications of well-established but not so 
well-known psychological phenomena such as learned helplessness and cognitive 
biases? I am particularly concerned about these conditions as they relate to the 
proliferation and normalization of American media.<br>
<br>
<br>

Dear Scott “Henry” Rollins,<br>
<br>
This is a wonderful email you clearly spent at least 5 minutes on. Excellent use 
of a Thesaurus! Keep up the good work. <br>
<br>
As for the answer to your question, no of course the current state of public 
policy currently imposed on us by the American media doesn’t take into account 
that they are creating cognitive biases. The American media, although not solely 
responsible for these type of heinous actions, have stripped the archetypal 
American down to its most base level of perspicacity, and is clearly bent more 
on dynamic and dramatic posturing rather than clear and veracious fact. However, 
I feel just as strongly that this is due greatly in part to the education system 
working parallel to the media.<br>
<br>
For good references, I suggest reading “the deliberate dumbing down of America” 
by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt. Oh, and thanks for giving me the word “fucktard” 
to use about a year ago. It seems to have caught on, oddly.<br>
<br>

<br>
Dear MSP,<br>
<br>
Can you make Hammeron fall head over heels in love<br>
with me? If not, can you atleast make him give me<br>
head? If not, can YOU please give me head?<br>
<br>
Look man, I really want some love and/or some head.<br>
<br>
Can you arrange it, especially if you can get it from<br>
Hammeron.<br>
Thanks for your time and patience.<br>
<br>

Dear Biljac,<br>
<br>
I think that the way to make Hammeron fall in love with you is to stop being 
such a pansy and tell him how you feel. Just say “Hammeron, I love you. Or at 
least like you enough to allow you to give me oral pleasure.” I think you will 
find that a direct approach here can have positive results!<br>
<br>
As for me giving you head, I am afraid that I am spoken for, but I appreciate 
the offer. <br>
<br>

No, but I suggest you get in touch with Biljac if you are cruising for a good 
piece of ass.<br>
