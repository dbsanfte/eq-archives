<p>
Hammer here, and its been a very exciting week.  After spending quite a bit of time working on the Rallos Zek script, the only thing between us and the elemental 
planes, we finally got to the "fake" RZ:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/fakeRZ.jpg"><br>
<p>
He fell quickly, bringing us to the warlord himself and an amazing battle.  I must say, I thought we did pretty well for out first attempt<br>

<p>
I really wish I could make movies of EQ because Rallos does a crazy cool animation with his axe where he tosses it up and catches it and then swings it around.  Another mob 
that has an outstanding animation is Arlyxir in Solusek Ro's Tower<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/arlyxir.jpg"><br>
<p>
The swooping attack on it is phenomenal<br>

<p>
We've also killed Tallon, Saryrn, and Mith Marr recently:

Here are two shots by MSP that he wanted to contribute.  The first one is a "cool" pic of Mikla hugging our buddy RZ.<br>

<p>
And this one I'm just gonna put up and let you think of it what you will.<br>

<p>
Thats it for actual news...<br>

<font size = +1>PART TWO: QUOTES</font><br>
<p>
Got a few so far.  This first one came from an anonymous Paladin exactly as you see it.<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/MSP/paladins.jpg"><br>
<p>
Here we have a few members expressing their own unique issues<br>

And so you see that we are a politically correct type of guild…  I believe the final verdict on the new name for dwarves is VCCM, or "vertically challenged cock monster", 
but this was the initial push for a more politically correct name.<br>

<p>
I feel the love here..<br>

<p>
No Marley Rant ™ this time, kids.   I feel too much love in the air right now to rant on my own, too.<br>
<p>
I love you all.<br>
<p>
<font size = +1>PART FOUR: ASK MR SMARTYPANTS</font><br>
<p>
Out of the few emails I got since my first post, this one was the funniest.<br>
<p>
Mr Smartypants,<br>
<p>
Who are the people in EQ that influenced you the most?<br>
<p>
Anonymous<br>
<p>
Well, Anonymous, the first thing I can tell you is that if you send an anonymous email, don't use an email address with what is obviously your EQ character's name.  
It kinda makes the whole "anonymous" thing not quite as effective.  <br>
<p>
Regardless, I will answer your question.  I don't think anyone really INFLUENCED me at all in EQ.  I mean, I have some people who made EQ fun, but I honestly cannot say 
anyone influenced me.  Although, there are a few people that really kept my energy high, and a few people I would thank along the way for giving me some good insights 
and laughs.  <br>
<p>
For example, thanks to LARINY for letting me use your password so we could look at the Nightbane boards.  Got some really good stuff from there, and I appreciate it.  
It's a shame they booted you from Night Eternal, though.<br>
<p>
Another person I would thank would be ZFALCON.  Every time I needed someone to be my bitch, there you were.  Thanks.  Probably one of the funniest egomaniacal liars of 
all time.  Don't get me wrong, I don't miss you one bit.  I just enjoyed watching your foot as you tried to talk around it.<br>
<p>
And hmmm who else?  In GH, I would have to thank HOOLOOVU.  A strange person, but fun as hell to torture people with.  If you ever want to hear a creative use of the 
English language, talk to Hoo.<br>
<p>
Oh and I can't forget STORMBEARD.  In some ways it's too bad that we never really got into a heated argument.  At least he would have given me a run for my money.  
I'm betting his posts made me laugh more than mine did for him. <br>
<p>
Finally, I would have to thank the awesome people who would send me all the inside dirt on your guilds.  It really made some of my more memorable posts just amazingly 
easy.  I always enjoyed watching some of the ego filled shitheads spluttering and fuming when you helped me spill all the good juicy bits of their idiocy to the rest 
of the world.  Remember kids, people LOVE to see others fail.  It makes for great drama.  When you treat others like shit, don't be too shocked when those same people 
will ram that plug up your ass at the first available opportunity.<br>
<p>
Until next time!<br>
