  <tr>
    <td><font size="2">Well another big target has fallen to Grey Hawke (our 
    motto: “Be the turtle, not the hare.”). A fantastic
    <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=flawless" target="_blank">FLAWLESS</a> 
    victory killing Fennin Ro, The Tyrant of Fire on our second try. I would 
    like to point out a few people that really made this (and other raids) work 
    so well. <br>
    <br>
    First, Mookus Dinglehopper. Also known as “He Who Rarely Reads” by the 
    officers in Grey Hawke. For as much of a pain as this guy can be, he is a 
    fucking pit bull at leading raids. He sinks his teeth in, and simply will 
    not let go. <br>
    <br>
    Next, our tanks. Keithh Strongsmell, Baladinn Bigass, Remf Da Trollop, 
    Kurghann Freakhead, and Twinpeaks Bigtits, Croso Wondernuts, Siid Everdead, 
    Nlocnil Lincoln, and Mongo Boogerknuckle. These guys are amazing at what 
    they do. I have no idea what they do, really, but they are amazing at it. 
    Good job. <br>
    <br>
    Slowers! You know who you are! I find it really…. dumb… that you would do 
    the <a href="http://www.encuentro2000.org/crazy.jpg" target="_blank">crazy</a> shit you do 
    to slow and malo a mob, but as the old saying goes “better you than me”. 
    Excellent. <br>
    <br>
    Clerics. When you aren’t AFK healing
    <a href="http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/lancashire/pc_wallpaper/animal/puppies.jpg" target="_blank">
    puppies</a> or whatever it is that you do, you guys (and gals) kick ass. 
    Fennin Ro healing was nearly flawless. I say “nearly flawless” because if I 
    said “flawless” I would get about 30 emails explaining why it wasn’t 
    flawless, and there is just nothing worse than listening to healers ramble 
    on about the differences in “<a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=13" target="_blank">Complete 
    Heal</a>” vs “Sorta Complete but not Totally Heal” or whatever. I usually 
    delete cleric emails as fast as Viagra or “Grow your Penis 9 inches” emails. 
    I already HAVE a 9 inch penis, and I don’t really care about the fancy 
    graphs showing me the differences in heals when you have the Golden Dildo of 
    Antioch equipped. <br>
    <br>
    Monks. Way to pull. Way to die. Freaks. <br>
    <br>
    Anyway, after all that was accomplished, you would say to yourself “Mr. 
    Smartypants, why would you have anything to bitch about? Things went so 
    smoothly!” And as usual you would be completely
    <a href="http://www.signslanguage.com/wrong.jpg" target="_blank">wrong</a>. So what could be 
    so wrong about such a wonderful victory? Well...  </font><p><font size="2">
    As much as we have tried to get along with and help this group of
    <a href="http://www.dltk-kids.com/animals/image/s/tigers.jpg" target="_blank">paper tigers</a>, 
    they still find it necessary to send little spies like an
    <a href="http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/index.cfm?category=1008760196" target="_blank">
    Ebay</a>ed druid and a recently returned rogue (welcome back! how was it 
    being <a href="http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/74362/200.jpg" target="_blank">banned</a>?) 
    to watch our tactics. This is sad. I mean, sitting a druid right IN our camp 
    where a train could be caused isn't exactly a brilliant idea. Neither is 
    gathering your entire guild less than 1/3 a zone away and doing
    <a href="http://ghguild.com/forum/upfiles/smiley/jerkit.gif" target="_blank">NOTHING</a> for 
    the three hours an event may take in anticipation of a failure. Whoever came 
    up with that idea needs to have her estrogen levels checked. Seriously. 
    That's what we call <a href="http://www.suck.com/daily/97/02/05/l.gif" target="_blank">
    INSECURITY</a>. <br>
    <br>
    GH does not now, and never will condone such actions against another guild. 
    GH does not condone
    <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~nal7/randomness/cockblocking.html" target="_blank">
    cockblocking</a>, griefing, script blowing, or BS tactics of /petitioning 
    for a forced /random on a spawn. It would be grounds for a guild removal, 
    not applauded. We take our relationships with other guilds very seriously. 
    We want to work with other guilds, and usually will backflag people unless 
    there are extenuating circumstances. If we can only use 20 of 72 flags, why 
    would we care if someone from another guild gets them? That is, unless you 
    are a complete fool who would purposely blow the chances of that happening 
    with things like...ohhhh.... sending people to spy on a raid... you know, 
    that old bit. <br>
    <br>
    I guess a better idea would be to politely talk to a GH representative and 
    work something out rather than act like a bunch of overbearing
    <a href="http://homepage.usask.ca/~tep948/e-tards/geek41.jpg" target="_blank">tards</a>. 
    NOTE: If your estrogen is peaking and you can't control your anger then 
    perhaps you need to find a better guild representative. It does nothing to 
    further a relationship with our guild and creates general feeling of mutual 
    mistrust, rather than let both of our guilds benefit. But I guess if that's 
    the type of person you want to be known as, and could care less how it 
    affects your guildmates, what can be done?  </font></p>

You know what really pisses me off? Ok… I admit… a LOT of things piss me off. 
But today, I want to talk about drivers. Other people who drive usually piss me 
off.<br>
<br>
I admit it, I drive relatively fast. Not like “push it to the floor” fast, but 
more like “as fast as it looks like I can travel within reason” fast. The speed 
limit here on freeways is 60. So I go 65-70. But there always has to be some 
stupid motherfucker right in front of me that has decided that 60 really means 
“between 45 and 55 as long as I stay in the fast lane”.<br>
<br>
Why the fuck is it that these people seem to drive in front of me every single 
fucking night I go home? I think it’s a conspiracy of some kind. But I am 
working on fixing it. I have developed a rather attractive steel and aluminum 
hat that I wear now to ward off any of these conspirators reading my mind so 
they don’t know when I'm going to travel. NO LONGER will I be stopped from 
getting home in time to make raids into Vex Thall, or Solusek Ro (WE KILLED THAT 
MOTHERFUCKER SO SWEET).<br>
<br>
But maybe by announcing “Mr Deathray Stopper” (what I call my cool hat) I have 
just fucked myself and they will figure out a way to read my mind anyway. Or 
maybe they will just post spies like they used to when I wore all polyester 
suits for those 6 months (polyester isn’t as good as aluminum foil but it LOOKS 
good in greens and browns). YEAH I SAW YOUR SPIES! YOU CAN’T FOOL ME! HAHA!<br>
<br>
SITTING UP THERE PRETENDING TO BE COPS OR JOGGERS OR TELEPHONE REPAIRMEN OR OLD 
LADIES WALKING DOGS! Ok, yeah, the COP was real. I found that out when I started 
throwing things at him and yelling “I SEE YOU, YOU SPYING MOTHERFUCKER! HERE! 
SPY ON THIS FUCKING ROCK! HAHA! HEY! SPIES GET HANDCUFFS? WHAT THE FUCK?” I 
think he was a GOVERNMENT spy though, to be fair. <br>
<br>
But that old lady spy was cute. HER ROBOT DOG WENT DOWN! DOWN LIKE A…well a dead 
dog I guess. It must have been very sophisticated technology.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yeah… I hate people who drive slow, man. They piss 
me off.<br>

Dear MSP, <br>
<br>
Do you think that current state of sociological public policy in this country 
sufficiently takes into account the ramifications of well-established but not so 
well-known psychological phenomena such as learned helplessness and cognitive 
biases? I am particularly concerned about these conditions as they relate to the 
proliferation and normalization of American media.<br>
<br>
<br>
Scott Rollins<br>

****<br>
Dear Scott “Henry” Rollins,<br>
<br>
This is a wonderful email you clearly spent at least 5 minutes on. Excellent use 
of a Thesaurus! Keep up the good work. <br>
<br>
As for the answer to your question, no of course the current state of public 
policy currently imposed on us by the American media doesn’t take into account 
that they are creating cognitive biases. The American media, although not solely 
responsible for these type of heinous actions, have stripped the archetypal 
American down to its most base level of perspicacity, and is clearly bent more 
on dynamic and dramatic posturing rather than clear and veracious fact. However, 
I feel just as strongly that this is due greatly in part to the education system 
working parallel to the media.<br>
<br>
For good references, I suggest reading “the deliberate dumbing down of America” 
by Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt. Oh, and thanks for giving me the word “fucktard” 
to use about a year ago. It seems to have caught on, oddly.<br>

<br>
Look man, I really want some love and/or some head.<br>
<br>
Can you arrange it, especially if you can get it from<br>
Hammeron.<br>
Thanks for your time and patience.<br>

****<br>
Dear Biljac,<br>
<br>
I think that the way to make Hammeron fall in love with you is to stop being 
such a pansy and tell him how you feel. Just say “Hammeron, I love you. Or at 
least like you enough to allow you to give me oral pleasure.” I think you will 
find that a direct approach here can have positive results!<br>
<br>
As for me giving you head, I am afraid that I am spoken for, but I appreciate 
the offer. <br>

This update is a little late coming, and its not pants' fault, its mine and I apologize.  Its been a pretty amazing week, with us finally breaking into the elemental planes.  Its 
strange, during the RZ fight I could feel it, I think everyone could feel it, almost right away.  It reminded me of our first victory against the Emporer in Ssra, at like 80% 
life I already knew we were going to win, and as his life continued to drop you could tell everyone could feel it, hearts racing, swearing in guild chat.  It was intense and 
I'd be lieing if it didn't feel... contrived.  I believe it was fate that brought us to that point.  I believe that that night held for every one of us, the very meaning of our 
lives.  This is a war, and we are soilders.  What if tomorrow, the war could be over?  Isn't that worth fighting for?  Isn't that worth dieing.... oops wrong speech<br>
<p>
I know what you're thinking... I can't believe he made a matrix joke.  Oh well, thats enough from me... <br>

Dear MSP,<br> 
<p>
Why ru such a fag?<br> 
<p>
Anonymous<br> 
<p>
REPLY<br> 
Well Anonymous (who actually used an untraceable email unlike the first emailer), before I reply to your email I want to commend you on a truly spectacular grasp of the 
English language. Your eloquent prose truly moved me, and your mom and I are very proud of you. We will be even more proud when you graduate Jr. High! Personally, I just 
think you are there because the kids like that you are old enough to buy beer. <br>
<p>
Anyway, why am I such a fag? Well, it depends on how you define fag. I am going to assume you mean fag like the verb fag which means “to droop”. Well I'm droopy because 
I don’t work out as much as I should. I'm on a diet though, so it won’t be for long. And then your mom will start paying me full price again…. <br>
<p>
…ohhhh…<br> 
<p>
I see! You are concerned about your mom spending all of her money on me, and you won’t be able to buy the other kids beer because your mom is such a slut she has to have that 
big ol “MSP shlong of love” at every opportunity. <br>
<p>
Tell you what, I will eat this donut. I hope that helps.<br>
