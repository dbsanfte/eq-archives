		<font face="Verdana" size="2">Grey Hawke in EverQuest1 has finally won! 
		YAY! WINNAR WINNAR! Grey Hawke seems to be the only really viable guild 
		on Karana these days, and things are progressing nicely. To all the 
		guilds who couldn’t hold it together : we are enjoying your ex-members 
		just fine, and they are all fitting into the guild magnificently, thank 
		you. <br>
		<br>
		However, the intention of this post wasn’t to talk about how nice it is 
		to have such a solid guild after the introduction of two major competing 
		MMOs, or call out idiots (you know who you are… your names rhyme with 
		Vagina-gistica and Vagina-ilicien) who assume that Mr. Smartypants is a 
		PR guy for ANYONE much less Grey Hawke. Although I have to tell you… 
		anyone who reads this front page and assumes they will see anything 
		other than opinionated ranting is a flaming idiot. I mean seriously… get 
		a fucking sense of humor once in awhile or go hide in your shell, play 
		with your stamp collection, and let the big people talk. This is a rant 
		page you retards, not a “please join Grey Hawke because we will make 
		promises of high elf reach-arounds with every two items looted, just to 
		get you here in our guild” page. Grey Hawke relies on its long-standing 
		reputation of excellence, not on what a lunatic writes on the front 
		page, but some of you humorless morons obviously can’t understand that.
		<br>
		<br>
		For further information please call 1 (900) IMADUMBASS. Your call is 
		important to us, please stay on the line. <br>
		<br>
		ANYWAY… <br>
		<br>
		Rather than hide and pretend we don’t exist, like some horribly 
		disfigured stepchild shuttled away in an attic and only allowed to moan 
		when company isn’t over for dinner, I am here to tell you… Grey Hawke is 
		alive and well in EverQuest 2. There, I said it. The cat is out of the 
		bag. The pigeon has flown the coop. The party has left my pants. We are 
		a multi-game guild. <br>
		&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So how is life in EQ2, you ask? 
		Good, thanks! Grey Hawke has roughly 140 people in the guild at the 
		moment, and we generally seem to enjoy the game well enough. But like 
		any game where there are a large number of people gathered together in a 
		rough society, there are assweasels guaranteed to rear their pimply 
		heads, and issues that are going to occur. Below, I have outlined what I 
		feel are the biggest issues currently in EQ2. <br>
		<br>
		First, instanced zones on player number caps. On paper it works wonders, 
		but in reality there are some issues. For example, to complete the 
		Ghoulbane quest, there is a rare named mob (The Creator) that spawns 
		deeper in Ruins of Varsoon that is PERMA-CAMPED. And fine, with multiple 
		instancing, it wouldn’t SEEM to be a problem. However, the people cap on 
		this zone is excessive and causes nothing but problems and heartache. 72 
		people in that zone means EVERY spawn area is camped, and usually there 
		are 2-3 groups LINED UP ON TOP OF EACH OTHER waiting on the named to 
		pop. <br>
		<br>
		Here’s an idea! Make the cap in zones where you need named SUPER-RARE 
		mobs to spawn a smaller instance spawn number. Maybe 50, tops. Or make 
		the named spawn a clicky event… or put it in a mini-zone off of the main 
		zone like you have in Stormhold. Right now, this is extremely 
		reminiscent of camping Jboots in Najena, and it frankly pisses people 
		off more than anything. There is nothing like sharing a piece of 
		floorspace the size of a nipple with four groups all planning to pounce 
		on the next spawn to make you scream and beat on your keyboard in 
		frustration and agony. That, or just have the named spawn more 
		frequently. As it is, I forsee that camp and others like it turning into 
		rage-inducing shitfests that cause player grief, loss of subscribers, 
		and GM headaches. It CAN be fixed, but right now it’s a pain in the ass.
		<br>
		<br>
		Next, nothing pisses me off more than people who feel they can just 
		wander up to the resources you are harvesting and help themselves. If 
		enemy encounters can be locked, why aren’t harvesting encounters locked 
		too? Just put a timer on it… no activity for 30 seconds means it unlocks 
		the harvestable resource again. But shitty little kids who rudely take 
		your resource when they didn’t spend 30 minutes clearing all the 4 
		million fish spawns to properly pop new resources make me want to scream 
		and throw blunt objects at them and the nearest SOE employee. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, with any new game I expect to 
		see people being idiots. Here are some common household idiots and the 
		things they do to annoy others: <br>
		<br>
		1) Character Names. Come on… does SOE even HAVE a name filter? I have 
		seen more names that don’t even come CLOSE to meeting your naming 
		conventions here than I ever did in EQ1. Hawty Hotpants may be stupid 
		but funny, but names I have seen (but will not post here because they 
		don’t DESERVE to have their shitty lame names posted in a public area) 
		are unacceptable. And so far I have seen an absolute lack of GM 
		intervention on this issue. <br>
		<br>
		2) Griefers. Several times now I have run into griefers of a new EQ2 
		ilk. What they do, since they cannot train mobs in EQ2, is simply stand 
		in the middle of your group. Typically “evil” classes seem to do this 
		more, and based on previous experiences, the typical griefer shithead 
		assfucker is usually a teenager who feels they are “roleplaying” an evil 
		class even though they wouldn’t know roleplaying if they started 
		shitting d20’s tomorrow. So imagine a large group of people standing in 
		the MIDDLE of your group, waiting to steal your mob, or blocking your 
		view, spamming you with emotes the entire time just because they can.
		<br>
		<br>
		Of course my dream resolution for griefers would be a couple rounds from 
		a silenced MP5 in the back of the skull, but I'm sure there are other 
		solutions I haven’t thought of yet. Hopefully with more blood. <br>
		<br>
		3) Ebayers. Yep. Shit is ALREADY out there for sale. There are already 
		people who 6-box characters as fast as possible and sell them on Ebay or 
		other sites that care more about making a few dollars from the sales of 
		stolen data (stolen because SOE owns the stuff they are selling, NOT the 
		sellers) than being ethical. <br>
		<br>
		And for those of you that own “sweat shops” where you hire people from 
		shitty 3rd world countries so you can sell the accounts, or you 6-boxers 
		that do nothing but play a game to make money, here is a big happy FUCK 
		YOU from people who just want to play a game for entertainment. Thanks 
		for making fun into something that feels cheap. I hope you get hit by a 
		bus full of diseased rapists. You ruin the experience for people who 
		just want to have fun by perma-camping things and selling them off. You 
		ruin the sense of community that COULD be such an integral part of MMO 
		games just by existing, so fuck you and die. HINT TO GMS: When all 6 
		people in a group go LD simultaneously several times in a row… they 
		MIGHT be a sweatshop. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">SOE needs to hire a group of 
		people that just go out and fuck up Ebayers like this. Break their 
		fucking knees and let people know that we don’t want this kind of shit 
		in a new game. It’s NEW…start fresh and stop this now or it will only 
		get worse. <br>
		<br>
		4) People who rip other people off. Look, no one faults a person for 
		making a few extra gold pieces. I have a merchant I set up some nights 
		as well to sell off Adepts that no one in my guild can use, so I 
		understand it. But making crude items and selling them (DAMAGED, 
		usually… I can’t believe someone would sell an item at 40% damage…pay 
		the 8 copper for repairs before you sell it, fucker) for the same price 
		as pristine versions to people who don’t know any better. Or you other 
		people who SPAM THE FUCKING ZONE 40,000,000 TIMES that you want to buy 
		an item (paying big!! PST!) and then turn around and sell it at 5x the 
		cost immediately after a purchase RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PERSON YOU JUST 
		RIPPED OFF. <br>
		<br>
		The absolute lack of ethics I see from some people just astounds me. A 
		few nights ago, I saw a guy trying to sell off the FREE STATUE he got 
		with the game until I made it quite clear in the zone that the item he 
		was selling is free. I had two people who thanked me afterwards because 
		the asshead was trying to tell them it was a rare and valuable quest 
		item. Another guy I saw buying a quest item for 5 gold then selling it 
		at 30 gold, and I quickly let the zone (all instances) know exactly what 
		he was doing. I think if more people LOUDLY expressed what these ripoff 
		artists are doing, or GMs came in and capped them in the back of the 
		head with the GM version of an MP5, we would see less of it. A few 
		hangings in a public square is a SURE deterrent from this type of 
		behavior. <br>
		<br>
		Well that’s about it for me today… thank you for reading! As PR man for 
		Grey Hawke Inc, I would like to take the time to mention our benefits 
		plan. Yes, that’s right! A guild with a life insurance policy! I bet you 
		don’t get THAT anywhere else! For every 3 gold you give an officer in 
		EQ2 or every 2000 platinum to an officer for EQ1, you will be enrolled 
		in our wonderful health plan (coming soon with DENTAL!) that covers the 
		cost of any wrongful death* in either game. <br>
		<br>
		</font><font size="1">*Wrongful deaths are determined by a committee of

So many new faces mean only one thing: more ugly people. Ok I guess it can mean two things: more ugly people and new game releases. Rather than focus on the inordinate amount of truly hideous people we are adding to our ranks, I will focus instead on the “new games” and the spelling of the word “truly”. <br><br>


TRULY is spelled without an E. It is NOT spelled truely or truley. As much as I enjoy tormenting people who can’t spell any better than any typical pimple faced teenager picked at random from the bowels of any metropolitan high school, this word simply needs to stop being abused. Think of the kittens. For greater reference on how to not be an idiot, I recommend this website: http://www.m-w.com/ <br><br>


And before I get into the “new game” thing I also wanted to point out the misuse of the word “ding”. While I appreciate that people want to share their excitement upon leveling or gaining a new AA point, yelling “DING” in guildchat or shout is the virtual equivalent of yelling “congratulate me on achieving a meaningless task because I am insecure, and I need the reassurance to make my life complete”. <br><br>


ANY MONKEY WITH HALF A BRAIN can level in EQ1, EQ2 and virtually any other game. They are DESIGNED to make you level. That’s the POINT of the game, you fucking idiot. Do you yell “DING” at home when you level in Diablo II? With some rare exceptions I would guess not. It only seems to be that people need to share a sense of meaningless accomplishments when other people (that more than likely don’t give a flying fuck) are around.<br><br>
 

And those of you that CONGRATULATE others for yelling “DING” aren’t helping any. But to be fair, you are probably in the group of people that need a virtual pat on the back for accomplishing a virtual task that any retarded 5 year old can do too. Here is my suggestion: Save your “DING” shouts for important events. Capping your level to 70 is worthy of a DING. Making your 500th AA is worthy of a DING. Making your class level in EQ2 is worthy of a DING. EVERY OTHER LEVEL IS NOT WORTHY OF ME TAKING THIRTY SECONDS OF MY LIFE TO TELL YOU HOW FUCKING SPLENDID YOU ARE SO YOU DON’T BREAK DOWN INTO TEARS AT YOUR OWN WORTHLESS EXISTENCE! Seriously... no one really cares that you made level 8 when I can do it in under two hours on a Percocet and two beers. <br><br>


Fucking “DING”bats! <br><br>


Calm… calm… deep breath…. <br><br>


New games... <br><br>


Every single time a new game comes out, people panic. THE SKY IS FALLING THE SKY IS FALLING! Haha! I bet a bunch of you wankers ducked! Look kids, the sky is just fucking fine. New games come and new games go. After playing EverQuest for almost SEVEN years, I have seen it all. Guilds who used to be uber and L337 are suddenly empty shells because all of their flaky idiot “leaders” (using that term very loosely) have suddenly vanished off the face of the earth. Or they decide that they don’t want anyone ELSE to have fun while they are gone so they delete the guild.<br><br>
 

Yeah. MMMAYBE that should tell you something about your choice of guild, bunky. Maybe it tells you something about your own choices in life. Always choosing the most flashy things in life isn’t the best way to go, and going to a guild that caters to large egos who think they are the shit usually ends up exactly like that…shit. <br><br>


As for Grey Hawke… we proudly call ourselves the “Tortoise Guild”. We may not get to everything first. But then again, we don’t burn out like the flames of a gay summer fling either. We are probably the oldest original guild on Karana at this point. Grey Hawke has been around and WILL be around for a long time. We may have occasionally caused undue turmoil among some guilds, but we have overwhelmingly outlasted those fly-by-night “ego guilds” because we remain constant. Constant, honorable, and realistic in the needs and wants of our guildmates. You just can’t ask for more than that in my opinion. <br><br>


Grey Hawke will be here until EQ is dead and buried. Count on it. And for those of you wondering if you made the wrong guild choice… as long as you aren’t an asshole, and you want to have fun seeing this game to its fullest (eventually) come give us a try. Ask an officer if you can join a raid. This is a golden opportunity to join a long-standing guild led by officers that give a damn about fairness and integrity, and passing it up may be a wasted opportunity for many of you that would fit in well. <br><br>


The rest of you can burn in the lowest depths of Kelethin (hell). <br><br>


Rah rah rah and all that shit! <br><br>
