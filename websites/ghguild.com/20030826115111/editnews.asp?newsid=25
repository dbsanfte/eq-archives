For the last three years, Everquest has been about great achievements and turning points for Grey Hawke.  From our first killings of Nagafen and Vox, to Fear, Hate and 
Sky, then Trakanon and Veeshan's Peak and Phara Dar.  The Dain and Yelinak, Sleeper's Tomb and Ventani, then Temple of Veeshan and Aaryonar, Vyemm, Vulak and the Avatar 
of War.  On to Luclin and Arch-Lich, High Priest, Cursed, Lord Seru, the Emporer and finally our long awaited arrival in Vex Thal.  Last night was another amazing night 
and a big turning point for us.<br>
<p>
Last night we went into Vex Thal with a purpose and a plan.  We had yet to make real progress past DXXT and we wanted to change that.  It truly was an outstanding display, 
and after 6 long hours and 3 dead mobs, and surprisingly no wipe outs, the goal was in sight.  Aten Ha Ra was before us and it was the time of judgement.  Needless to say, 
this ugly bitch was found unworthy and at 3am she died in a near-perfect first time execution.  It had been a long, exciting, and stressful night, filled with the monotony 
that is moving around in VT and the rampant suicide pulling that becomes almost second nature.  Our monk team had died about 50 times collectively, but I have to say, it was 
well worth it, it was another great turning point, and we can close the book, in a sense, on another expansion:<br>

<p>
To those of you who have yet to brave this mighty shebitch, the secret, of course, is in the positioning:<br>

Here's the 45 man crew, who mostly arrived late and exhasuted to work this morning<br>

Sadly, Sumadan no longer holds the title of best robe (Sal`Varae) in the guild, that honor has moved to Sindaan<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/sindrobe.jpg"><br>
Damn that looks like a newbie robe, need to dye that thing!<br>
<p>
Getting to Aten placed us against 3 mobs we had yet to kill or even attempt, each fell on our first try:<br>

Over previous days and patches, we also took down our favorite VT duo, twice:

But Vex Thal has not been the only source of excitement... we have another Everquest expansion!  Wahoo bank slots, raid utilities, trade skills, worthless zones and DYES!<br>

You sir/madam, may call me the green lantern<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/greenlantern.jpg"><br>
<p>
I was the original neon lime green, but of course the madness was infectious<br>

<p>
I made the slight mistake of telling everyone I was going to make some collage of everyone in their new colors... thing is I slowly started to realize what an absolute 
shit load of work that would be... and I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this... plus, most of the guild decided to be "cool" and dye themselves black or other 
equally mundane colors, so those people won't have the honor and privaledge of being pictured here, not yet anyway.  Here are some GH members with simply outstanding taste:<br>

And of course... Croso looks stunning<br>

Even naked...<br>

I'd like to point out that while Coball was not attractive enough to be picture here, his feet were:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/coball2.jpg"><br>
They may be blue, but they still look retarded!<br>
<p>
We've also hit a few other targets recently

This might be difficult to believe but I'm actually out of real pictures!  So on to the funny<br>

It's been an amazing week, and I leave you with the simple words of Josiah Bartlett, "what's next?"
