<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today on MSP’s Wild Kingdom: The Idiot: Why are 
you such a fucking idiot? A scientific study in idiocy. <br>
<br>
Is there some reward you get at the end of your life for being the biggest 
possible idiot imaginable? Is there something in the Bible that says you get to 
go bowling with Jesus if you rank as high as possible on the MSP Idiot Scale ™ ? 
There must be, because there are so many idiots running rampant in EQ alone that 
I am starting to believe I'm either an alien, a super-genius, or I missed the 
biggest, most important memo, ever created. <br>
<br>
Idiots vary by degrees. <br>
<br>
Take what I call the “low level idiot”. This is a relatively harmless animal 
that normally resides under a rock. They are just generally clueless, but don’t 
bite, mostly because no one told them they have teeth and they were too stupid 
to figure it out without a self-help video tape full of really annoyingly cute 
animals. They are the people that die in water zones EVERY 20 MINUTES because 
they haven’t yet found that you can buy a water-breathing device for almost 
nothing in the Bazaar. <br>
<br>
Then comes the dreaded WDIDI (pronounced wah dee dee) which translates to “What 
do I do idiot”. These are fearsome creatures that creep up on you in the night. 
A Cleric who thinks he is a Wizard, a Druid who never realized that Druids can 
heal or buff, or a Warrior who is completely oblivious to the fact that they can 
taunt mobs.   </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imagine a young dragon with all the power 
dragons have. HUGE amounts of power. Now… imagine that dragon as a teenager who 
is SERIOUSLY fucking high out of his skull. I mean, whacked beyond the ability 
to reason. Now take that same dragon, loaded out of his mind, and convince him 
to go fuck up some knights at the local Knight Convention at the Howard 
Johnson’s. THIS is what a WDIDI is like. Absolute idiocy. Fear the Wahdeedee!
<br>
<br>
Here is a quick idiot guide. If you answer yes to any of these questions, you 
are more than likely an idiot. <br>
<br>
1) Do you wake up in a new guild monthly? <br>
2) Is drama the key focus in your life? <br>
3) Do people have to constantly remind you what your class does? <br>
4) Have you ever wandered aimlessly through a zone, looking for your raid, 
dragging a massive train behind you that kills everyone? <br>
5) Have you been unable to figure out that you can DOWNLOAD ALMOST ALL IN-GAME 
MAPS FOR FREE OFF THE INTERNET? <br>
6) Do you randomly go AFK while you are fighting a boss mob? <br>
7) Do you see LOADING PLEASE WAIT…. more often than you gain experience? <br>
8) Have you feigned death during a duel, thinking your opponent would fall for 
it? <br>
9) Have you ever intentionally done absolutely nothing at a raid hoping no one 
would notice? (we do) <br>
10) Do you guild hop like a rabbit on crack thinking none of the guild 
leaders/officers on the server talk amongst ourselves and compare notes on what 
a fucking idiot you are? (we do) <br>
11) Do you drive slow in the fast lane, thinking “I pay for these roads too” not 
realizing you are impeding traffic, and that if shooting people was legal there 
would be one less asshole like you on the road? <br>
12) Do you call the wrong number FOUR TIMES IN A ROW? <br>
13) Do people look at you and shake their heads a lot? <br>
14) Have you ever wondered if you are an idiot? (trick question… intelligent 
people care if they look like idiots, while idiots are completely fucking 
oblivious) <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, I almost forgot…we killed The Rathe Council and Coirnav. We got into Plane 
of Time or whatever those damned kids call it these days. <br>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">OK, let's catch up on pictures:</font><br><br>
This is Xegony, Note that one of her is crying. That is the Xegony closest to Nedd.<br>

<br>
This is a wood dude from Ragrax, Council of the Mustard (or whatever you crazy kids call it)
<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/wood%20dude.jpg><br>
<br><br>
This is a whole lot of them.  They are in a circle jerk I think.  I didn’t ask.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/rathe.jpg><br><br>
<br>
This is a dead Avatar of Dirt.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/earthdead.jpg><br><br>
<br>
This is Coirnav. We killed him.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/coirnav.jpg><br><br>
<br>
This is what you see when you first go into the Plane of Time. Yeah, I was confused as hell too.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/time%201.jpg><br><br>
<br>
After that, you see there are happy "themes" around Time. It's like Disneyland except you kill things. Here is Winter!<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/winter%20time.jpg><br><br>
<br>
Here is Summer! I love this season.<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/summer%20time.jpg><br><br>
<br>
and Spring!<br>
<img src=http://ghguild.com/images/upd020904/spring%20time.jpg><br><br>
<br>
And here is my favorite season... ROCK.<br>

Perhaps the greatest tragedy of this game we all devote so much time to, of this second life we lead is that in so many cases, the relationships we form with 
people are founded entirely within Everquest's context. How easy it is to forget that behind each character and anonymous identity is a living person. A person 
who may be feeling happiness, sorrow, depression, or pain, and all of these emotions unbeknown to us. <br>
<p>
How easy it is to forget, and how much we lose by not remembering, and by not working harder to further establish these relationships outside this game. I have 
always been one who felt that this life and my "real" life should be kept separate, and I have very few real world connections to any of the family members I 
call Grey Hawke. It is days like this that I can truly realize that this is not a wise approach, and one that I regret. <br>
<p>
I am deeply saddened to say that Lisa, or Vinrea as we knew her in game, passed away a few months ago. I did not have an extremely strong relationship with 
Vinrea in game but she was my guildmate and in Grey Hawke that makes her family. We fought together in this imaginary world and with this family we triumphed 
over all manner of struggles. But I did not know about her triumphs and struggles in real life and the tragedy that brought on the terrible loss that we are just 
learning about now. Hermana was able to relate more about the person behind the character, the person that I never got the chance to really know, and never 
will. <br>
<p>
“I was lucky enough to know a bit about Lisa's life and she was a woman who walked a rocky road but still kept her head up and a smile on her face. She had 
dreams and a passion for life, she had two cats she loved, she adored flirting and making her friends laugh and smile, she was a big into gaming and had 
grown up and lived in Montana. She was in her late twenties I believe, and worked nights at a local bar. She was beautiful inside and out."<br>

For Vinrea (written by Kaasa) <br>
<p>
I never heard your laughter or the sound of your real voice.<br>
Fate so cruel and heartless will not give me that choice.<br>
<p>
My eyes they did not know the color of your hair.<br> 
I had no way of knowing if your skin was dark or fair.<br> 
<p>
My heart knew more important things than my eyes could see <br>
You always were and will remain a true friend to me. <br>
<p>
There's an aching in my heart as tears run down my face, <br>
There's an emptiness where you once were that none will replace. <br>
<p>
May the angels hold you in their arms and raise you way up high <br>
May your words live in our hearts forever and your memory never die. <br>

Friends Without Faces (submitted by Grapaully) <br>
<p>
We sit and we type, and we stare at our screens <br>
We all have to wonder, what this possibly means. <br>
With our mouse we roam, through the zones in a maze <br>
Looking for something or someone, as we sit in a daze. <br>
<p>
We chat with each other, we type all our woes <br>
Small groups we do form, and gang up on our foes. <br>
We wait for somebody, to type out our name <br>
We want recognition, but it is always the same. <br>
<p>
We give kisses and hugs, and sometimes flirt <br>
In tells we chat deeply, and reveal why we hurt. <br>
We do form friendships - but - why we don't know <br>
But some of these friendships, will flourish and grow. <br>
<p>
Why is it on screen, we can be so bold <br>
Telling our secrets, that have never been told. <br>
Why is it we share, the thoughts in our mind <br>
With those we can't see, as though we were blind. <br>
<p>
The answer is simple, it is as clear as a bell. <br>
We all have our problems, and need someone to tell. <br>
We can't tell real people, but tell someone we must <br>
So we turn to the 'puter, and to those we can trust. 
<p>
Even though it is crazy, the truth still remains <br>
They are Friends Without Faces, and odd little names. <br>
<p>
--<br>
<p>
It is my deepest regret that I knew her only as Vinrea, and not as Lisa. May she rest in peace. <br><br><br><center> </b>You may pay your respects to Vinrea (Lisa) in our forums.
