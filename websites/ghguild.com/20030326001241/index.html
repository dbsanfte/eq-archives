I'd like to start by paying a short tribute to the men and women in Grey Hawke who risk their lives to defend our country.  A very good friend of mine and a long standing 
GH monk was deployed to the Middle East last week.  I speak for the entire guild when I say good luck bro, come home safe.  With war barely looming in the distance, I'd like 
to say thank you to all those who sacrifice so much to ensure the freedoms of this great nation, you are truly the greatest of heros.<br>
<p>
So yeah... Everquest, not feeling very important these days, but we've still been going at it.  Vex Thal cleared again, and we've now killed every boss in the zone at least once:<br>

For the last three years, Everquest has been about great achievements and turning points for Grey Hawke.  From our first killings of Nagafen and Vox, to Fear, Hate and 
Sky, then Trakanon and Veeshan's Peak and Phara Dar.  The Dain and Yelinak, Sleeper's Tomb and Ventani, then Temple of Veeshan and Aaryonar, Vyemm, Vulak and the Avatar 
of War.  On to Luclin and Arch-Lich, High Priest, Cursed, Lord Seru, the Emporer and finally our long awaited arrival in Vex Thal.  Last night was another amazing night 
and a big turning point for us.<br>
<p>
Last night we went into Vex Thal with a purpose and a plan.  We had yet to make real progress past DXXT and we wanted to change that.  It truly was an outstanding display, 
and after 6 long hours and 3 dead mobs, and surprisingly no wipe outs, the goal was in sight.  Aten Ha Ra was before us and it was the time of judgement.  Needless to say, 
this ugly bitch was found unworthy and at 3am she died in a near-perfect first time execution.  It had been a long, exciting, and stressful night, filled with the monotony 
that is moving around in VT and the rampant suicide pulling that becomes almost second nature.  Our monk team had died about 50 times collectively, but I have to say, it was 
well worth it, it was another great turning point, and we can close the book, in a sense, on another expansion:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/ahr1.jpg"><br>
<p>
To those of you who have yet to brave this mighty shebitch, the secret, of course, is in the positioning:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/ahrplacement.jpg"><br>
<p>
Here's the 45 man crew, who mostly arrived late and exhasuted to work this morning<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/ahrdead.jpg"><br>
<p>
Sadly, Sumadan no longer holds the title of best robe (Sal`Varae) in the guild, that honor has moved to Sindaan<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/sindrobe.jpg"><br>
Damn that looks like a newbie robe, need to dye that thing!<br>
<p>
Getting to Aten placed us against 3 mobs we had yet to kill or even attempt, each fell on our first try:<br>

<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/vxahr1.jpg"><br>
<p>
Over previous days and patches, we also took down our favorite VT duo, twice:

<p>
But Vex Thal has not been the only source of excitement... we have another Everquest expansion!  Wahoo bank slots, raid utilities, trade skills, worthless zones and DYES!<br>
<p>
You sir/madam, may call me the green lantern<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/greenlantern.jpg"><br>
<p>
I was the original neon lime green, but of course the madness was infectious<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/teamgreen.jpg"><br>
<p>
I made the slight mistake of telling everyone I was going to make some collage of everyone in their new colors... thing is I slowly started to realize what an absolute 
shit load of work that would be... and I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this... plus, most of the guild decided to be "cool" and dye themselves black or other 
equally mundane colors, so those people won't have the honor and privaledge of being pictured here, not yet anyway.  Here are some GH members with simply outstanding taste:<br>

<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/olio.jpg"><br>
<p>
And of course... Croso looks stunning<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/croso.jpg"><br>
Even naked...<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/deadcros.jpg"><br>
<p>
I'd like to point out that while Coball was not attractive enough to be picture here, his feet were:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/coball2.jpg"><br>
They may be blue, but they still look retarded!<br>
<p>
We've also hit a few other targets recently

My last update was so large, and recieved such overwhelming positive feedback (ok I'm making that up, no one actually reads this site) that I felt it just wouldn't be right 
to post an update of less magnitude.  As a generally lazy person, this worked out very well.
<p>
Firstly, its MiniMosesMan!<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/minimoses.jpg"><br>
<p>
And part of our continued coverage of Tata, check it out, she's a barbarian, and dead sexy<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/tatabarb.jpg"><br>
<p>
So, I had PC names off, and don't really know who this is (ok I'm lieing, I do know who it is) but DAMN they are fugly<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/thefuck.jpg"><br>
<p>
And of course, what update would be complete without Coball's feet?  Those boots are crazy dude<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/coball.jpg"><br>
<p>
Anyway, on to other stuff.  We've been in VT a reasonable amount over the last few weeks, and finally saw this:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/50vt.jpg"><br>
If you can't read that it says "Hammeron doesn't care"
<p>
So, blobs, IV clones, and 4arm bitch ladies = dead<br>

Speaking of IV clones, we couldn't resist the real deal
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/itraer2.jpg"><br>
<p>
And apparantly we killed blood, of which I have no real memory
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/blood4.jpg"><br>
<p>
We also killed Aerin and Behemoth, neither of which I took screenshots of<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/aerin.jpg"><br>
<p>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/tactics.jpg"><br>
<p>
Here's a picture of mezz's familiar in the bazaar...<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/mezzfam.jpg"><br>
... this might not seem terribly interesting until you realize that not only was mezzini not in the bazaar but he hadn't been online for a good 6 hours.
