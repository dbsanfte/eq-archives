          <font size="2">The foundation of Grey Hawke’s Code of Conduct is made 
          up of two different concepts. To establish a common mind set, it is 
          important for all the members to understand the difference between things 
          that are encouraged and rules. This is to set a standard for the guild 
          as a whole. </font></span></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="msg"><br>
          <font size="2">Though this Code of Conduct is explicit, it is never-the-less 
          only a tool and is always open for interpretation by the Guild Leader 
          and the Officers. At no time shall the Code of Conduct be used as a 
          weapon against the Guild Leader or the Officers in attempt for an individual 
          to undermine the guild as a whole. Grey Hawke is not a strong dictatorship, 
          but does have a solid leadership structure and though members might 
          see flaws within this structure, membership is in itself an acceptance 
          to follow its standards. In addition, the code of conduct will change 
          with Grey Hawke. It is a living document that will reflect the beliefs 
          of the guild, which change as time goes on. </font><br>

            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="msg"><u>ENCOURAGED:</u> 
              These are behaviors, which reflect well on a given member, and do 
              pride to the overall guild. Things that are encouraged are not expected 
              from the member, but overly doing the opposite can make a member 
              poorly reviewed by the officers and possibly removed. <br>
              <br>
              Example: It is encouraged for members to give items to the guild 
              instead of selling or trading them to the general public. Knowing 
              that sometimes people need funds that the guild can not provide, 
              have extreme expenditures such as working on a trade, or have the 
              opportunity to make a beneficial trade it is completely understandable 
              to dispose of items that one has acquired in the fashion they deem 
              best. Now if a person is always getting nice items and selling them, 
              taking from the guild and not giving in return then the leadership 
              can convene on whether that person is “Grey Hawke” quality and possibly 
              have them removed. <br>
              <br>
              Example: It is encouraged that an officer performs an active role 
              in guild matters as deemed necessary by the Guild Leader (being 
              active does not necessarily mean the member must be publicly vocal). 
              Extreme inactivity or inability to participate in guild matters 
              may warrant a request to step down from the office. <br>

            <li><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="msg"><u>RULES:</u> 
              Rules are things that are grounds for removal from the guild. Generally 
              the Guild Leader would be removing a person for a breach of a rule 
              or has the right to either bring in the officers for review of the 
              breach or give a warning. Rules broken can damage the guild’s reputation 
              and/or cause overall loss of trust and unity within the guild. <br>
              <br>
              Example: It is a rule that everyone treat each other with respect. 
              A loss of temper and words exchanged during a raid where things 
              go bad is not acceptable and undermines the continuity of the guild. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Example: It is a rule that one acts with honesty and integrity with 
              all other members or non-members regardless of rank. To loot an 
              item on a raid without permission is a breach of this rule. </span></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="msg"><br>

          <font size="2">Members violating this Code of Conduct are subject to 
          discipline from the officers. Most commonly, members will not be subject 
          to immediate discipline without discussion between officers. Its is 
          the intention of the officers not to make rash decisions and to check 
          with our peers before exacting discipline upon someone. Exceptions may 
          occur, but as a matter of policy members will be warned about their 
          actions. <br>
          <br>
          Discipline will range from a warning, a request to leave an event, loot 
          probation of various lengths and ultimately guild removal. Grey Hawke 
          looks upon guild removal as the final, regrettable solution to extreme 
          or repeated violation of the Code of Conduct. <br>
          <br>
          This Code of Conduct is not definitive and all-inclusive. Every possible 
          action will not be detailed here. Members are expected to understand 
          not only the specific rules and examples here, but also the intention 
          of this Code Of Conduct. The intent of this Code is to encourage members 
          to be a team or a family so that we may achieve great things together 
          and enjoy ourselves in the game and each other's company in the process.

          Members should understand that just because they request this, it may 
          not be granted. It is the responsibility of the officers to address 
          these requests on a case-by-case basis and approve or deny them based 
          on the requirements of the raid. If a member notices another member is

          they may receive an item they wish to have, their record may be

              a wishlist because it allows that member to plan for themselves

              actions will be taken: A) Member is readmitted without further action.

              assigned, and the returning member is *expected* to seek GH groups

              to make a presence and are denied readmission (guild tag is removed).
