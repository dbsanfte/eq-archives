<p>
Hammer here, and its been a very exciting week.  After spending quite a bit of time working on the Rallos Zek script, the only thing between us and the elemental 
planes, we finally got to the "fake" RZ:<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/fakeRZ.jpg"><br>
<p>
He fell quickly, bringing us to the warlord himself and an amazing battle.  I must say, I thought we did pretty well for out first attempt<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/RZTW59.jpg"><br>
<p>
I really wish I could make movies of EQ because Rallos does a crazy cool animation with his axe where he tosses it up and catches it and then swings it around.  Another mob 
that has an outstanding animation is Arlyxir in Solusek Ro's Tower<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/arlyxir.jpg"><br>
<p>
The swooping attack on it is phenomenal<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/arlyxir1.jpg"><br>
<p>
We've also killed Tallon, Saryrn, and Mith Marr recently:

<p>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/saryrn2.jpg"><br>
<p>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/mmdead.jpg"><br>
<p>
Here are two shots by MSP that he wanted to contribute.  The first one is a "cool" pic of Mikla hugging our buddy RZ.<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/MSP/rallos.jpg"><br>
<p>
And this one I'm just gonna put up and let you think of it what you will.<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/MSP/deyth.jpg"><br>
<p>
Thats it for actual news...<br> 
<p>
<font size = +1>PART TWO: QUOTES</font><br>
<p>
Got a few so far.  This first one came from an anonymous Paladin exactly as you see it.<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/MSP/paladins.jpg"><br>
<p>
Here we have a few members expressing their own unique issues<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/MSP/ashtor.jpg"><br>
<p>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/MSP/biljacsuckass.jpg"><br>

<p>
And so you see that we are a politically correct type of guild…  I believe the final verdict on the new name for dwarves is VCCM, or "vertically challenged cock monster", 
but this was the initial push for a more politically correct name.<br>
<img src = "http://personal.ghguild.com/hammeron/MSP/kilrav6.jpg"><br>

I feel the love here..<br>

<font size = +1>PART THREE: MR TRANSLATIONPANTS</font><br>
<p>
No Marley Rant ™ this time, kids.   I feel too much love in the air right now to rant on my own, too.<br>
<p>
I love you all.<br>
<p>
<font size = +1>PART FOUR: ASK MR SMARTYPANTS</font><br>
<p>
Out of the few emails I got since my first post, this one was the funniest.<br>
<p>
Mr Smartypants,<br>
<p>
Who are the people in EQ that influenced you the most?<br>
<p>
Anonymous<br>
<p>
Well, Anonymous, the first thing I can tell you is that if you send an anonymous email, don't use an email address with what is obviously your EQ character's name.  
It kinda makes the whole "anonymous" thing not quite as effective.  <br>
<p>
Regardless, I will answer your question.  I don't think anyone really INFLUENCED me at all in EQ.  I mean, I have some people who made EQ fun, but I honestly cannot say 
anyone influenced me.  Although, there are a few people that really kept my energy high, and a few people I would thank along the way for giving me some good insights 
and laughs.  <br>
<p>
For example, thanks to LARINY for letting me use your password so we could look at the Nightbane boards.  Got some really good stuff from there, and I appreciate it.  
It's a shame they booted you from Night Eternal, though.<br>
<p>
Another person I would thank would be ZFALCON.  Every time I needed someone to be my bitch, there you were.  Thanks.  Probably one of the funniest egomaniacal liars of 
all time.  Don't get me wrong, I don't miss you one bit.  I just enjoyed watching your foot as you tried to talk around it.<br>
<p>
And hmmm who else?  In GH, I would have to thank HOOLOOVU.  A strange person, but fun as hell to torture people with.  If you ever want to hear a creative use of the 
English language, talk to Hoo.<br>
<p>
Oh and I can't forget STORMBEARD.  In some ways it's too bad that we never really got into a heated argument.  At least he would have given me a run for my money.  
I'm betting his posts made me laugh more than mine did for him. <br>
<p>
Finally, I would have to thank the awesome people who would send me all the inside dirt on your guilds.  It really made some of my more memorable posts just amazingly 
easy.  I always enjoyed watching some of the ego filled shitheads spluttering and fuming when you helped me spill all the good juicy bits of their idiocy to the rest 
of the world.  Remember kids, people LOVE to see others fail.  It makes for great drama.  When you treat others like shit, don't be too shocked when those same people 
will ram that plug up your ass at the first available opportunity.<br>
<p>
Until next time!<br>
<p>
Mr. Smartypants<br>

As the crypt opened with an alarming creak, a rain of dust poured from the lip of the long unused block structure.  A hand, strangely familiar, came out from the dim 
interior and pushed open the heavy slab enough for the figure to emerge.<br>
<p>
The figure, covered in dust and cobwebs, spoke.  “Who the FUCK hath raised me from the fucking dead?  Hath the evil Mooshi, eternal bitch of Stormbeard, returned? Or 
something more…sinister?”<br>
<p>
“No, dark lord…” a robed figure replied. “We wish you to create something for us”<br>
<p>
“A curse?  I’m really good at those!” came the hopeful question.<br>
<p>
“No dark one... WE WISH FOR YOU TO CREATE…” came the rising crescendo fury and passion from the robed figure as he raised an ancient and very powerful dildo in the sacred 
fashion “THE FRONT PAGE NEWS FOR GREY HAWKE!”<br>
<p>
“Ohhhh.  Right on.”<br>
<p>
And so it began…<br>
<p>
That was pretty cool.  If only it were that dramatic.  What really happened is I told Grey Hawke that I used to be, Mr. Smartypants, a relatively well known troll-type 
person on the EQVault (affectionately known as Whiner’s Vault) that used to hammer a bit on fucktards that thankfully left our server.<br>
<p>
So, am I going to tell you right here who I am?  Nah.  I figure it will leak out soon enough, and the people I really want to know already know, or will know soon enough. 
 The rest of you can suffer.  I like suffering.  It makes me feel warm and fuzzy, like a heated ball of cotton in the ass.<br>
<p>
So, on to my first front page… I intend to make twice weekly updates to the page in four parts.<br>
<P>
Part ONE is screenshots and the serious stuff.  Like “what has GH done recently, and do we have pictures to show you” kind of stuff.  The brag shots… that old drill. 
 Hammeron is really gonna do that part.  I suck at paying enough attention to actually take screenshots where I am not humping something.<br>
<p>
Part TWO is where I am going to blatantly rip off people from here and other boards with funny quotes that were captured in the game.  Haha! I'm so fucking creative! 
Haha!  No, but seriously…<br>
<p>
Part THREE is dependent on another person.  If Marley is on a binge that week, I will most likely get to hear him rant.  It’s what he does.  If so, part three is going 
to be “MARLEY’S RANT OF THE WEEK” and my translation of said rant.  If not, I will either have a guest ranter (is that a word?) or I will have a section I call 
“MR. TRANSLATIONPANTS” where I help the readers translate some of the really wacky shit we see from our message boards. <br>
<p>
Part FOUR.  Got questions for me?  Super.  I used to have a really fucking odd group of people send me really fucking odd questions all the time on Whiner’s Vault.  
I really enjoyed that because it made me feel superior to them, and with my low self esteem I really need that a lot.  So if you have a question for me, email me here 
and I will answer it if you aren’t a complete idiot.  Or maybe even if you are… <a href="mailto:m_smartypants@yahoo.com">m_smartypants@yahoo.com</a>.  I will try and answer them in a clear and concisely negative 
manner.<br>
<p>
On with the show!<Br>
<p>
<font size = +1>PART ONE: PICTURES</font><br>
<p>
(Hammeron) I've been slacking this week, no pictures yet but there will be soon.  I would like to say that Mr. Smartypants uses FrontPage and for that he should be 
shamed and ridiculed<br>
<p>
<font size = +1>PART TWO: QUOTES</font><br>
<p>
Uhhh…. I don’t have any quotes yet.  I feel like a failure.<br>
<p>
<font size = +1>PART THREE: MR TRANSLATIONPANTS</font><br>
<p>
A few days ago, Marley was kind enough to post a marvelous rant concerning his favorite topic… not joining GH.  I have posted my translations and comments throughout his 
message.  Enjoy.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY) If............. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS) Here is where he inhales on the Bong of Life.  Hold it… hold it… and release.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY).....you ever plan on leaving - dont take membership in our guild if GH Isnt for you (you have a whole trial process to figure this out - shouldnt be to hard). 
We dont want people who dont want to be here. <br>
So if you think you will join til you find your ideal guild - dont that guild doesnt exist and you are a person who will never be happy anywhere - so dont joing GH. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS) Here he is trying to say “If you leave your current guild, please feel free to apply to GH.  We have an application that you must fill out.  
However, if you feel that GH will be the answer to all of life’s problems you are most likely retarded.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY)....you think GH is an UBAR Guild - we are not - we are on a weak ass slow server months behind the curve - we are not now nor have we ever been really all that 
UBAR - we are a social guild that likes to strive for the high end of the game - but RL is more important to us than playing EQ and often times that prevents us from 
really moving on to hiGHer end targets. <br>
But if you enjoy hours of banging your head against the same wall and rude all caps guilds says durnign CR - than have we got a guild for you. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS)  Ok, first I have to point out that it’s “UBER”.  Ok kids?  Uber.  It’s a German thing.  Like Ubermonkey.  That means “really kick ass monkey”.  
Anyway… here Marley is trying to point out that GH, while it may be a solid guild that has lasted for over four years, is not a guild like Night Eternal wishes they were.  
We are a group of people who actually have lives, and many of us will actually kiss a girl before we die that we aren’t blood related to.<br>
<p>
We can and have fail at killing big targets FIRST because of that silly “real life” that exists beyond the monitor in front of you.  We are the tortoise, not the hare.  
We have made mistakes.  But we always persevere in the end because we are mature and determined.  Also, because we have garden gnomes.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY)....you like playing 6 different classes and rotating between them - GH is looking for people who play and max one charcter - who learn it, know it and play it 
to the best of thier abilites. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS) Please limit your focus to one primary character while you are in GH.  While multiple personalities are fun, we prefer it otherwise.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY).....you never have been treated riGHt by the guilds you have in - its not the guilds buster - its you - you suck and you will NOT be happy in GH - we dont like 
you already and you havent joined us yet. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS)  Let’s call a duck a duck, Ok?  If you are a slut like a Rogue I know in another guild, you will be a slut here.  Don’t blame others because you 
fuck for loot.  And although I can appreciate the thought of an attractive underage girl giving me a blowjob as much as the next guy, we prefer your eternally open legs 
remain elsewhere.  We prefer legal age sex acts and morals to the alternative you would offer.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY).....you are a rock star - we dont care how much you know - if you are tool who thinks they are beter and smarter than everyone else - we are sure you are just 
dont be it in our guild. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS)  Don’t come here and expect you are smarter than everyone else.  You aren’t.  We have been doing this for four years, when it took hours and 
countless deaths to break into Plane of Fear.  You are not that smart.  Trust me.  If you think you are smart, ask me and I will help you realize your mistake.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY).....you are NOT LOYAL - look this is simple - we only want people to join who are going to be w/ GH for the long haul. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS)  Sure, everyone may have made some mistakes in their choices of guilds.  But if you find yourself “outgrowing” your guild every six months, 
it means you are a loot whore and have all the loyalties of a deranged flea.  You didn’t outgrow them, they stopped giving you the loot you feel you deserve and 
you want to find the next group of people to pile it on you.  WE know it, YOU know it.  Save everyone the drama you will cause in the future, when you whine and 
cry about how unfair you are treated and then try to make the guild kick you out so you don’t have to return the items you got.  Been there, seen that.  Just recently, 
actually…<Br>
<p>
(MARLEY).....you are planning on playing another MMP - look i am sure sWg WoW MEO are all going to be great but we dont want to baby sit you til they come out.... s
ave us the trouble and dont join us. <br>
MMPs are a great time sink and a major drag on ones' RL - we are looking for people who feel they have put to much time in EQ already and who DONT want to play another 
MMP ((no matter how great it is)) becuase they want to finish what they have started here - and one MMP is enouGH. <br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS)  Make sure you like EQ.  If you are burned out, great.  Go burn out somewhere else, drama queen.  We want people who wish to be a team player.  
And sure… EQ won’t last forever, but if you don’t plan on sticking it out for awhile, don’t bother applying.<br>
<p>
(MARLEY).....YOU DONT LIKE READING CAPS IN GUILD SAY - becuase its fun to type in all caps - how like me now BIATCHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<br>
<p>
(MR TRANSLATIONPANTS)  Here Marley is saying “I like to type in caps because I am legally insane.”<br>
<p>

About 25 of us made an excusion into the Tower of Solusek Ro the other day, very cool zone.  Just so you know, these shots are all seriously modified so you can actually see
something, the zone isn't nearly this light and cheery.  Thanks Sent for sending me some of these, you can tell which are his because unlike me he doesnt have all his graphic
