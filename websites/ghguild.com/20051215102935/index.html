Over the last few months I have personally witnessed all the nay sayers, whiners, moaners, complainers and pretty much everyone with a negative cant win shit attitude lay claim to the ineptness of Grey Hawke. Thankfully most of these people are no longer with us of their own chosing and some are sipping a fine mug of Uncle Sindy's premium STFU. Tasty aint it bitch. As I proclaimed in my last update we are now running the loot tractor through Tacvi every Sunday and Nytedemon wears his daisy dukes in celebration every time (umm...but you need a bikini wax cause you've got a serious case of Hairy Gorilla Taint). So I am glad to see those who had no faith move on. Hope you found the happiness you sought. For those that stayed. Glad you did and be sure and order another STFU burger cause I am enjoying watching you eat them. For the faithful.....BOOO YA! </p>
      <p>So since we werent content with simply farming Tacvi we simply had to go back to MPG. For far too long we've been bitches to the likes of the Master of Foreskinnage and his hearty minions. It was beyond time to put on the PIMP hat and put his bitch ass in the stable with the rest of them. Behold....Badge of Pimpness....</p></td>

      <p>Not exactly the look I was going for. Just goes to show you that even Ture likes it kinky. I did not take pictures of loot though. We got some, people are wearing it, whatthefuckever.       
      <p>So whats next for Grey Hawke you might be asking? Truly we were animals in our quest for Anguish access. But we have yet to fully smack down all the other content Sony has thrown at this game. Some of it isnt worth the effort to even go there (Hello....Mons Letalis....WTF Over.....) and some of it isnt raid content. Yet we like to keel dragons with impunity. Luckily there are some in DoN I hear (yeah....shocking) so we beat the ass off two of them but I only have a shot of us about to kill one. Yeah, no kill shot so you'll have to assume I am telling the truth. Would I lie to you?

      <p>We beat this bitch like a broke back mule. Speaking of bitches......

If your name is Nedd then yes I was.We've pretty much put every mob in Tacvi on bitch status with the exception of Tuna boy.  Morphing mobs really speak to me.  They say "I dont have an imagination for this encounter so I'll feed you various versions of all the shit you have already fought".  That's terrific.  Dont make the encounter a real challenge.  One requiring intelligence.  Just throw shit at the raid and see what comes through.  One prop I will give Tuna is the awesome model.  One of the finest in the game.  I simply must have a cloak with giant skull crackers tied to it.  Im gonna buy a hulla hoop and "shake that thang" in the most annoying places possible.  But not at Nytedemon's house cause he's got a thing for that...<br>
