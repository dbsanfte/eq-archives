            <p>It is strongly recommended that you register first in order to 
              fully utilize the abilities of the forum. Depending on the forum 
              administrator, some forums may require you to register first before 
              you can post new topics or replies. </p>
            <p>Registration takes only a couple minutes, and allows you to access 
              additional features (not available to guest users) such as the followings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Post / reply messages </li>
              <li> Edit your posts </li>
              <li> Edit your profile and choose avatar</li>
              <li> Receive email notification of replies to posts and threads 
                you subscribe </li>
              <li> Send private messages to other members </li>
              <li> Access private forums</li>

            <p><strong>How do I register?<a name="1_2"></a></strong></p>
            <p>To register, you will need to specify a username and password, 
              and a valid email address. Depending on the registration system 
              setup, you may be required to verify your e-mail address (Admin 
              has the ability to specify the requirement). In that case, a notification 
              e-mail will be sent to you immediately after you registered. Please 
              confirm your e-mail address by clicking on the confirmation URL 
              printed in the notification e-mail. Once you confirmed your e-mail 
              address, you will be able to log in, view, post, and use other features 
              (such as vote, rate message, etc.) in our member-only forums. <br>

            <p><strong>How to Log-in?<a name="1_3"></a></strong></p>
            <p>You may log in using the link located at the top of each forum 
              page. A pop-up window will open upon click. At the bottom of the 
              login window, there is a check box called &quot;Save as Cookie&quot; 
              (please refer to our user manual for detailed information), and 
              you can check the box so that you don't have to manually input login 
              information every time you come to the forum. Remember, do not use 
              this feature if you are using public terminals to access the forum.</p>
            <p>After you logged in, you will see your current login status at 
              top right corner of each page.<br>

            <p><strong>Why can't I login?<a name="1_4"></a></strong></p>
            <p>You must register in order to login. If this is not the case, then 
              you might be entering the wrong username and password; or you might 
              be banned from the forum admin (a message will be displayed if you 
              have). In any case, you should contact the forum administrator to 
              find out why. <br>
              <a href="faq.asp#section1">Back to top</a></p>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>Why do I get logged off automatically? Can I log off manually?<a name="1_5"></a></strong></p>
            <p>If you do not check the &quot;Save as Cookie&#8221; box when you 
              log into the forum, the system will automatically log you off 30 
              minutes after you close the browser. This prevents misuse of your 
              account by anyone else. To stay logged in check the box during login, 
              but this is not recommended if you access the board from a shared 
              computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.</p>
            <p>To log out anytime, simply click on the logout link at the top 
              of each page, and the forum will erase your session information 
              and bring you back to the homepage of the web site (this is configurable 
              by administrator).<br>

            <p>This option is configurable in your profile, you will find an option 
              &quot;Hide from online user list&quot;. Please note that Administrator 
              has the ability to turn &quot;hiding from online status&quot; off.<br>

            <p><strong>What is the member list and how do I use it?<a name="1_7"></a></strong></p>
            <p>The Member list displays total number of registered members and 
              some of their basic information. You can sort the display order 
              by playing with the arrow keys <img src="image/asc.gif" width="15" height="15" align="absmiddle">and 
              <img src="image/desc.gif" width="15" height="15" align="absmiddle">, or searching 
              member alphabetically. </p>
            <p>This page also allows you to send private messages, send e-mail, 
              visit member&#8217;s homepage, or add member to your contact list 
              (address book/block list) using a combination of check boxes. <br>

            <p> You can change your personal information easily by clicking the 
              &quot;My Profile&quot; link located at the top of each page. Any 
              changes you make to your profile will take effect immediately after 
              you hit &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Apply&quot;. <br>
              <br>
              You can customize the forum display to suit your needs (threaded 
              tree style, flat style, or simplified flat style), edit your personal 
              profile, choose/upload an avatar for yourself, or link/upload your 
              own profile photo! In addition, you can add a signature and have 
              it displayed under your posts. <br>

            <p> You can adjust the forum time zone by setting the time difference 
              (in hour) between your local machine's time and the server's time.

            <p>Your Profile photo will be displayed in your public profile, and 
              your chosen avatar will be displayed beside your posts under your 
              username. </p>
            <p>Our avatar system allows forum members to select an avatar (a small 
              image) from our avatar collection, or to upload their own images 
              to use as their avatars.</p>
            <p>To select an image from our avatar collection, please click on 
              the &#8220;Click to choose avatars&#8221; link located in My Profile 
              page. Once you click on the link, a window titled &quot;Click on 
              the avatar you like&#8221;, will pop up and will show you a list 
              of all the avatars to choose from.<br>
              <br>
              To set up your profile photo, you can either put in a link or upload 
              your own image to our server. To upload a profile photo, you can 
              click on the &#8220;Upload my picture&#8221; link. A pop-up window 
              will appear for you to upload the image from your local hard disk 
              drive. </p>
            <p> Once you have made a change to either avatar or profile photo, 
              remember to scroll down to the end of the page and click on &quot;OK&quot; 
              or &quot;Apply&quot; button to save the changes. Please also note 
              carefully as we have image dimension limits for both avatars and 
              profile photos.<br>

            <p><strong>What is the signature for?<a name="2_4" id="2_4"></a></strong></p>
            <p>While you register, you may have noticed a field that asks you 
              to enter your signature. You can reset your default signature in 
              My Profile later on. It might be a piece of text or a phrase that 
              you would like to be inserted at the end of all your posts.</p>
            <p>You can also manually turn the signature on and off on a per-post 
              basis by checking the &#8220;add signature&#8221; box when you post/reply/edit 
              your messages.<br>

            <p><strong>What is the Private message system?<a name="2_5"></a></strong></p>
            <p> All Private Messages are stored in &quot;My Inbox&quot;. This 
              function allows you to send private messages to other members in 
              the forum. It works just like your everyday e-mail system, but are 
              limited to registered members. You have the ability to send, to 
              read, to create/edit/delete folders, to move messages between folders, 
              and also to delete unwanted messages. <br>
              <br>
              Of course, you can send private messages to multi-recipients at 
              once by inputting their user names (separated by comma) in the recipient 
              textbox, or simply checking the box beside their name from your 
              address book and hit &quot;Send Private Message&quot;.<br>
              <br>
              Please note that some members may disable the private message system 
              (editable in My Profile), or put you in their &quot;block list&quot;. 
              In these cases, you won't be able to send PM to them.<br>

            <p><strong>What is the PM Status?<a name="2_6"></a></strong></p>
            <p>&quot;PM Status&quot; bar at the bottom of the My Inbox page lets 
              you know how many messages you have stored and whether you have 
              reached the storage limit. Once your PM folders are full, you won't 
              be able to take PM anymore. If this happens, simply delete some 
              old PM's to free up the space. <br>

            <p><strong>Can I track whether a PM message has been read by its recipient 
              or not?<a name="2_7" id="2_7"></a></strong></p>
            <p>When you are sending private messages, you can check the box called 
              &quot;Save a copy to sent folder?&quot;. This function allows you 
              to store messages you sent, and to check whether your messages have 
              been read by the recipients or not. <br>
              <br>
              To check the PM Read Status, simply go to your &quot;Sent&quot; 
              folder, and click on the recipients' names. A window, &quot;Checking 
              PM Read Status&quot;, will pop up and show you the result of the 
              read status. <br>
              <br>
              With our latest release, you can choose to &#8220;Always save PM 
              to sent folder&#8221; (editable in My Profile), so you don&#8217;t 
              have to check the box of &quot;Save a copy to sent folder?&quot; 
              every time you send private messages.<br>

            <p><strong>How can I subscribe to a forum or thread?<a name="2_8"></a></strong></p>
            <p> My subscription allows you to track the activity of a thread or 
              a forum. By subscribing to a forum or thread, you will be notified 
              through e-mail once there is a post. The notification e-mail contains 
              a link to the newly posted message, and you can just click on it 
              to view the new message. <br>
              <br>
              To subscribe to a forum or thread, simply click on the <img src="image/subscribe1.gif" width="22" height="16" align="absmiddle">Subscribe 
              icon located right below your login status, and the forum will take 
              you to the subscription control panel for further customization. 
              This page allows you to review your subscription, and you can also 
              remove any subscription you no longer need.<br>

            <p><strong>How do I use My address book?<a name="2_9"></a></strong></p>
            <p> My Address Book stores all the members you have added to your 
              contact list. This function works side by side with private messaging 
              system. When sending PM's to a group of users, you can bring up 
              &quot;quick address book&quot; for easy access to your contacts. 
              You can even block any member you don&#8217;t like into the &quot;Block 
              list&quot;. Like My Inbox, here you have the ability to create/edit/delete 
              groups, and to move members between these groups. <br>

            <p><strong>How do I add members to my address book / block list?<a name="2_10"></a></strong></p>
            <p> There are three ways you can add members to your personal address 
              book. First of all, in other members' public profiles, right beside 
              the member name there is a<img src="image/address.gif" width="20" height="16" align="absbottom">icon 
              which you can click on to add him to your address book. Secondly, 
              you may also add members to your contact list/block list from the 
              Member List interface. The last method allows you to add other member's 
              to your contact from the message display interface (please refer 
              to <a href="faq.asp#3_9">this FAQ</a>). Adding members to your block 
              list works in the same way. <br>

            <p><strong>What is the online buddy list?<a name="2_11"></a></strong></p>
            <p> &quot;Online Buddy List&quot; (located both in My Inbox and My 
              Address Book) allows you to view members in your address book who 
              are currently online. You can send them PM's or E-mails from the 
              online buddy list as well.<br>

            <p><strong>Can I block someone because I do not wish to receive any 
              PM sent from them?<a name="2_12"></a></strong></p>
            <p> Block list is designed for the need of some members who do not 
              wish to receive private messages from certain people. If you put 
              some members into your block list, you will not be receiving any 
              messages from them because they won't be able to send PM to you. 
              Messages posted by these people will be hidden from you as well 
              (please refer to <a href="faq.asp#3_9">this FAQ</a>).<br>

            <p><strong>What is post revision?<a name="3_12"></a></strong></p>
            <p>Admin can specify whether to enable post revision for each forum. 
              If post revision is enabled, every message being edited will have 
              &#8220;Revision: 1&#8221; link showing at the lower right of the 
              post. <br>
              <br>
              When a message is edited, the previous version will be stored and 
              available for viewing. This is a very flexible feature because Admin/Moderators 
              can decide whether or not a message should be revised when they 
              edit a message, thus overriding the default setting in the admin 
              panel. <br>

              To post a new thread, click on the <img src="image/post.gif" width="77" height="20" align="absmiddle"> 
              located at the top left of the message list. A pop-up window will 
              appear and you can write your messages in it. Every forum has its 
              own permission setting, and therefore, if you don&#8217;t see a 
              post link, please don&#8217;t panic, because you may just forget 
              to log in or simply do not have the right permission to post. Your 
              permission to the forum can be viewed at the bottom right corner 
              of the forum.<br>

            <p><strong>How do I add a signature when composing my post/reply?</strong><a name="4_2"></a><br>
              <br>

              set in My Profile (just check the box right under where you type 
              your signature, and remember to submit the change).<br>

              <br>

            <p><strong>What are PGD codes? How do I use these special codes?</strong><a name="4_5" id="4_5"></a><br>
              <br>
              PGD Codes are designed to provide simple and effective formatting 
              methods in a post. There are 16 pre-defined codes, so you don't 
              really have to type the codes yourself. You can also format a text 
              block by first highlight a text block and hit the PGDCode button. 
              Detailed descriptions for all available PGDcodes can be found by 
              clicking on the &quot;?&quot; link. <br>

              the current cursor position.<br>

            <p><strong>Can I upload an image or attachment to my post?</strong><a name="4_7"></a><br>
              <br>
              You may attach a file to your post. The allowed file format and 
              the maximum file size will be displayed when you click on &quot;Click 
              here to upload&quot;. <br>
              <br>
              For graphical files (jpeg, gif, bmp, png), you can embed the uploaded 
              picture in the post directly by checking the box: &#8220;Embed picture 
              in post&#8221;.<br>

            <p><strong>How do I create and vote in polls?</strong><a name="4_9"></a><br>
              <br>
              Creating new poll works just like posting messages. By clicking 
              on <img src="image/poll.gif" width="74" height="20" align="absmiddle">, 
              a pop-up window will appear and you can enter your Poll Question 
              and vote choices in it. If you would like to create a poll that 
              allows multiple selection (checkbox instead of radio button), check 
              the &#8220;Allow Multiple Selection?&#8221; box. Enter the poll 
              choices below the message body text box.</p>
            <p> Once the poll is submitted, members will be able to vote, view 
              result, edit poll, or even strip poll (some of these options only 
              applies to the poll creator and the forum moderators). There are 
              many options provided when editing your poll. You can change your 
              poll question, add/edit/delete poll choices, and change multiple 
              selections to single poll selection, etc.<br>
