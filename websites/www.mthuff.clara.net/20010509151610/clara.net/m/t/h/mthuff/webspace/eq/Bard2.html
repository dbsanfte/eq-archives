<SMALL><SMALL><SMALL>This page is for ordering only. It does NOT show who
needs what scroll, but rather it to enable you to sort through what spell
you need, and what their reference numbers are. Where a spell is marked as
"UNKNOWN" it means that it is not known whether the spell is purchasable
from a vendor, or is from an NPC drop. Accordingly these spells have been
included as if they were "dropped". If you locate an "UNKNOWN" scroll, please
contact <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com">EQcastersrealm</A> and
<A HREF="mailto:eq@mthuff.clara.co.uk">Fiddruin</A> (webmaster) so that others
may benefit from your discovery.</SMALL></SMALL></SMALL>
