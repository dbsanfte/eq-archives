<BIG>Rules, advice and instructions for using these pages:</BIG>
<P ALIGN=Left>
  <HR>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Rules:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Caster's must be at least within 5 levels of being able to use a scroll,
    otherwise it's "muled" until they can use it.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    This webpage url and password must not be divulged outside of the guild.
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Center>
  <HR>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Advice:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Priority is given to primary characters. Please enter "alt" after your name
    if requesting a spell for an alt.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Scrolls should be "given" rather than charged for, if you need to charge,
    contact an officer for further guidance.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    That said, Casters should, if possible, pay market rates for scrolls to the
    doner, but if unable, might wish to contribute what they can afford.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    No debts should be entertained - un-necessary friction may result!
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    All players should write down names of scrolls held, find them on the central
    list, and see if anyone is looking for them, once a week.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    If no-one needs it - try to get in the habit of handing them over to the
    Mule.
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
  <HR>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The "Mule"
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    There is only 1 mule, it lives in Felwithe Bank, Great Faydark
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    It is named "Scribbles", and is operated by Karas <I>only</I>.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    In the event of Karas leaving EQ or CoN, a new mule will be created, and
    all scrolls will be transferred to that mule.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Spells held by the mule may be traded/sold at Karas's sole discretion.
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
  <HR>

Instructions:
<P ALIGN=Left>
How to order scrolls:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Click on the link to your caster's class, and follow instructions on the
    page.
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
How to check who-needs-what scrolls.
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Go to the mainpage, and look down alphabetic spell list. If a name appears
    opposite the spell, it is needed by that player. His name is his email link,
    and if you hold that scroll, he may be contacted, and a meeting in-game arranged.
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
How to use the Mule:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    If you hold a scroll that is not needed by anyone in guild, then you have
    several options. You can sell it on the open-market, or you can give it to
    the guild's mule for future use by lower level CoN casters.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    If you decide to supply the guild with the scroll, contact Karas in game,
    and arrange a meeting with the mule. EVERY effort should be made (if possible)
    to supply a CoN caster with a scroll he has indicated as needing, under no
    circumstances should Karas's mule be used as a middle man - else he will
    be continually be interupted!
