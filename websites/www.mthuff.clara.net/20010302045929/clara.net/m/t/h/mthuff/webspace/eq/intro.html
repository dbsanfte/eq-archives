Introduction:
<P ALIGN=Left>
This website is designed to:
<P ALIGN=Left>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Enable CoN casters to notify all of the guild as to what spell scrolls they
    are seeking.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Enable CoN players to see quickly if a spell they have looted is needed,
    and if so by whom.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Enable the looter to contact the caster via email to arrange a handover.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    Set out a mechanism whereby currently held stocks of dropped scrolls can
    be held centrally by a guild mule, for future use by CoN casters, or for
    sale/trade at Karas's discretion
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
The website is arranged thus:
<P ALIGN=Left>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    A central webpage to <I>see who needs what </I>scrolls.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    A page of rules and guidance, also detailing the "mule" and how it should
    be used.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    A series of pages, one for each caster class, where scrolls may be
    <I>ordered</I>.
</UL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
Entry to this&nbsp;website is password protected, with the usual CoN EZboard
guild password, in order to prevent spurious requests from NoN-guild players.
<P ALIGN=Left>
