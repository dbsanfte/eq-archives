While 3 cleric scrolls were obtained for SoA/DK clerics from the Overking, it wasn&#8217;t the warriors&#8217; lucky day as the Queen unfortunately did not carry the ancient blade during both times she was killed.  On a brighter note, I heard that the second Queen fight was near perfect having only a single death -- WTG guys, that&#8217;s definitely a huge improvement from our last attempt(s).
