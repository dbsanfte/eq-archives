But its been a wee while since the last update so just posting something to let people know we aren't dead yet :)<br>That and i need something to bump that picture of Xandar down.... gnomes, *shudder* :p<br><br>Anyway will post another update later on in the week / next week and we will see if there has been any more activity.</FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

Perhaps thou doth not sucketh so much anymore. ;)<br><br><center><img src="/news/fenar-epic.jpg"></center><br><br>Well the scheduled VP raid was a bust due to lack of participants and critical classes (e.g. clerics/warriors) so we killed whatever was available for us to kill.  <br><br>First to die was Gorenaire, 'twas nice to know we could still kill her with a small raid party although we had a few more casualties than usual.  Congrats to Kaas-DK for the white scale and bard drums.  The dragon hero bracer and paladin book went to Dragon's Claw members Sidara and McFinn, who were along for the kill.   <br><br>Next up was Wuoshi who did not like our "port-in-and-kill" approach but succumbed eventually once we got our forces in order.  Congrats to <b>Calek</b> for the Skydarkener bow, <b>Tiann</b>, Ming-VS and Dasheeva for emerald scales and Gnar-DC for the Blade of Luclin.<br><br>Third target was Velketor the Sorcerer who we kill primarily for fun and faction since his loot really suck, but <b>Zerax</b> did come out with Boots and Gloves of Bladecalling from it.  We tried Vindicator afterwards, but again, a couple messed up pulls caused us to abort prematurely and we never had a decent attempt until folks had to logoff.<br><br>The following day, we didn't have enough people again so we passed some time by killing Lord Doljonijiarnimorinar which finally gave up the nice Frozen Turban which <b>Lemieux</b> received.  Went to Skyfire afterwards for another meeting with Talendor.  Congrats to Seleron-DK for the RBB, Frakis for the pouch, <b>Belain</b> for the Dragon Hero bracer.  The red scale was given to Kaas-DK and the bard horn to someone. ;)   The Vindicator attempt was again postponed due to lack of people, maybe some day we'll have enough interested folks online at the same time to get our 2nd victory over him. ;)</FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>
