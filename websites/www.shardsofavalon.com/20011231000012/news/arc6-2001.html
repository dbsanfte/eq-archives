For the past couple of weeks we have been making mild attempts to see what lay beyond our good friend Arraken, usually withmixed results. But today it came together and for the first time on Xegony Ikatiar the Venomed was slain! He was a fun fight, despite a slight hiccup at the start with agro. Congratulations to Regents (IS) on his new <b><a href=http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/maskofvenom.shtml target=new>Mask of Venom</a></b> and to Marika (VS) on her, er shiney? new <b><a href=http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/poisonsoakedtunic.shtml target=new>Poison Soaked Tunic</a></b>.<br><br>Along the way we also picked up a Plate Bp for <b>Ranum</b> and a Leather Tunic for <b>Werin</b>, finishing his set (leather drops are just too damn high for only two classes to use), grats!<br><br>After we had seen to Ikatiar our next stop was Eashan of the Sky. A named drake that lurks before the first dragon. We all got our first look at what lay ahead as well with out first glimpse of the ancient wyrmm Aaryonar. We couldnt get too close but i included a pic of what we did see. Our fight with Eashan was a learning experience, we had no idea what to expect or what strategy would best defeat him, but in the end despite an atrocious start we got him to some 15% health (he was at around the Eas when the last of us died). Next time he will die. At this point id like to give a hearty FU to whoever at Verant came up with those Hatchlings... very... very....... annoying. By this time it was well late in the night, and after an unfortunate accident our CR party got wiped, we decided to call it a night. We shall be returning soon to finish what we started, no doubt Eashan will be hanging at the temple pub this evening making himself sound like a big man to all his dragon mates about how he saw us off. Well you just wait buddy, you just wait.... cause your gonna get yours, you mark my words!! <br><br>Oh yeah pictures.. nothing much since lets face it we all seen Wyverns before and i didnt get a shot of Eashan (will get one next time), so i included what we saw from the main hall.<br><br><center><a href=/news/ikatiar.jpg target=new><img src=/news/ikatiarTHUMB.jpg border=0><a href=/news/aaryonar.jpg target=new><img src=/news/aaryonarTHUMB.jpg border=0> </FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

Once setup and buffed we cleared out his lair, and after waiting ten minutes for him to <b>walk</b> back we got him coming, with the end result of one face-kicked dragon. Felt really good to finally see this guy go down. Congratulations to <b>Lemieux</b> and Zwei (VS) who both scored a very nice pair of <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/greysuedeboots.html target=new>Grey Suede Boots</a></b>, Marika (VS) on a <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/veldraksshortblade.html target=new>Veldrak's Shortblade</a></b> and <b>Brienaire</b> on her <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/shissarapothicstaff.html target=new>Shissar Apothic Staff</a></b>. We also scored a Green Scale which went to Bryden (VS) to finish up his long overdue warrior epic!<br><br>Since we didn't relly know what we were doing we spent a fair bit of time wandering and trying to figure out just what the hell we were up against hehe. So it was already well late in the day by the time we got to Xygoz. He was a total gimp and went down in no time, I think he managed to kill two people (one being me - I knew resisting silence was going to bite me in the ass).<br><br>Next up we spent some time figuring out how to get Druushk in. Thanks to a 2 hour experimentation when he actually did come people were afk and totally unprepared, leading to a spectacular opening which only got better when he agroed a nearby wurm. After cr we again had trouble pulling him, unfortunately when we did get him we tried to get our casters to dodge his AE, the result being a whole lot of dead casters and three free AE's for Druushk. By this time it was way, way too late so we left VP, but we will return armed with what we learnt this time and we expect our next trip to be <b>alot</b> smoother.<br><br>Here are some pics. I didn't have one of Hoshkar (I was dead <img src=/news/icon/icon11.gif> ) and no one sent me one (watch me get 6 in my next email check), nor a picture of Druushk, but I got a really nice one of Xygoz and included a nice landscape.<br><center><a href=/news/xygoz.jpg target=new><img src=/news/xygozTHUMB.jpg border=0></a> <a href=/news/xygozdead.jpg target=new><img src=/news/xygozdeadTHUMB border=0></a> <a href=/news/pitroom.jpg target=new><img src=/news/pitroomTHUMB.jpg border=0></a></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

First up came Trakanon. Normally he'd be a total gimp and barely worth the mention, but I figure why not. Headed in at around 3am est with a grand total of 14 people from SoA and IS, 3 of them roboed. Got a few more and were sitting around in reet room after moping up protector and decided we couldn't be bothered waiting two more hours for people when we could just try now and if we failed we'd have more by the time cr was done. Well we kicked his ass. In the end I think we used a grand total of 17 actual people, the only two casualties being Sitten who got Trak-touched and me cause, well I was the only wizard casting Lure of Ice (Thxs extreme agro!). Loot was as always jaw dropping (haha). We got 6 teeth which are what we were really after, went towards finishing up some key Veeshans Peak er... keys... Also dropped <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/mannarobe.html target=new>Manna Robe</a> which went to Furzen (IS) and, since it wouldn't be Trak without one, another <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bloodemberbreastplate.html target=new>Blood Ember Breastplate</a> which is currently sitting on Ranum's Ranadin-wanna-be sk twink. While we're at it, anyone wanna buy a BE bp? hehe.<br><br>Next day stuck with naught to do, we were going to try Dain with IS, but we had a shortage of people and no real puller so instead we decided to pay a visit everyones favorite gimp giant (no not Derekor the other one). Despite a total lack of any real effort by anyone he still dropped like the gimp he is and disgorged his usual trove of rather sad caster loot. Grats to <b>Gradie</b> on his new click toy, a <a href=http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/vermillionorboftorrefaction.html target=new>Vermillion Orb of Torrefaction</a> and to Cyrinishad (IS) on his new <a href=http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/velketorsspellbook.shtml target=new>Velketor's Spell Book</a> and <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/bootsofbladecalling.jpg target=new>Boots of Bladecalling</a><br><br>Today saw us returning once again to the Halls of Phara'Dar and giving Veeshans Peak another run. We've had a slight shortage of keys lately so we needed to get a few more done, now that we have enough it's back we go. Well first up is, as always, Silverwing. As always the pull took sixty times longer than the fight. Lucky us Silverwing decided to test out her gate spell this time 'round. Hooray for camping. Only up side was she at least had the good taste to summon Frunkle, and its always funny to watch a cleric trying to melee a warrior, its just sad to have the cleric actually HURT the warrior...<br><br>At any rate after logging back in and rezzing our poor summonees (yes I know it's not a word) we went again with the predictable result of one dead dragon. Another fine display of balance and forethought from Verant, loot was as follows. Grats to <b>Zammel</b> and <b>Marlana</b> who each recieved a <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/hammerofthedragonborn.html target=new>Hammer of the Dragonborn</a>. Can someone explain to me why it wont stack with agility? Congratulations also to Norl (VS) on his uber <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/dragonclawmaingauche.html target=new>Dragon Claw Main Gauche</a> and <b>Emile</b> on his <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bluedflowerkatana.html target=new>Blue Flower Katana</a>. Thanks Silverwing, while your loot is ass, it's always a pleasure killing you.<br><br>We started late, so by this time it was already around 10:30pm but we decided to have a quick shot at Hoshkar before we logged for the night. Since this was only our second trip to VP and the first time Hoshkar handed us our ass (we were just totally unprepared for him heh) we decided to give him a whirl in safe corridor in order to see if we could get him to gate health and if we could we'd fight him in his lair. Well Hoshkar proved a total bunyip to pull. In total it took us about 45-50 minutes to get him solo. I'd like at this point to say that i have discovered the worst way to lose in EQ. It is when you <i>know</i> the mob is going to gate, but you're not sure if you can win, then winning emphatically and watching victory slip from your grasp as the dragon does exactly what you expected and gates... Being the lucky recipient of the first post-gate summon I got to watch Hoshkar with NO red left in his name summon me and kill me. he then proceeded to wipe others out one by one. By this time it was too late to actually finish him off, but you better believe we will be back there tomorrow, getting past this mofo and seeing if we can't pay a visit to a few of the other denizens of this dragon infested hovel. Tomorrow the saga continues.<br><br>Also I know it's a long ass update heh, just read what you want and gloss over the rest <img src=/news/icon/icon41.gif> <p><br><center><a href=/news/trak18.jpg target=new><img src=/news/trak18THUMB.jpg border=0></a> <a href=/news/velkdead.jpg target=new><img src=/news/velkdeadTHUMB.jpg border=0></a> <a href=/news/swdead.jpg target=new><img src=/news/swdeadTHUMB.jpg border=0></a> <br><br></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

But here we are and there he lay. At around 11pm EST Sontalak had assumed the position and coughed up his talisman. A combined effort by <b> Shards of Avalon</b>, <b>Venator Sapentia</b> and <b>Illuminati Sancti</b> exerted their authoritah and broke this pug faced freak in half. <br><br>It was never going to be an easy fight, took us three tries. First time 'round we weren't really prepared for the amount of sheer damage output he can pour into a buffless warrior and before he had lost a fifth of his health Sitten went down squealing. It wasn't a few seconds before Sontalak turned and made a BBQ our of the rest of our poor melee and casters (discretion being the better part of valour I ran away into ToV, shrieking the whole time like a little girl...). <br><br>Second time round we were better prepared but it seems we forgot one little rule, and it's truly amazing how quickly your tanks die to an enraged dragon. Funny to see 10 people fall over hehe. However my humour was short lived as Sont took this oportunity to pay me back for my previous cowardice and current state of blasting him with Lure of Ice and I dropped to the pavement. My dismay turned to incredulous disbelief to zone back in and see Sontalak walking back to his guard post with <b>NO red left in his name!!!</b><br><br>Gentle reader this catastrophe could <b>not</b> be allowed to stand. Regrouping and rebuffing ourselves we were soon ready to engage once more. Tragically the pull went horribly wrong when Sontalak failed to kill Calek at the start but we quickly recovered from our horror. Getting stuck in like the angry midget he is Sitten took charge while our clerics pumped every little scrap of mojo they couldn into his beaten body. All was going well when disaster struck. Realising that this was his final chance Sontalak invoked the dreaded lag gods and cause a server spike that threw everyone out. Combining with his enraged attack Sontalak made a final last gasp effort, slaying many brave warriors. But it was too little, too late for the mighty red beast as with a final few swipes to take some casters and rangers with him he came crashing to the ground for the first time ever on Xegony...<br><br>Let the Temple of Veeshan farmers rejoice! For no longer must they suffer under the heel of this tyrant when farming for phat lewtz! The way to Temple of Farming is clear for all and will undoubtedly be packed by people who would normally never have gone while Sontalak lived.<br><br>It was Sontalak so hopes were never high for the booty haul. In a remarkable show of good taste he dropped his Talisman for Thuel (IS) to finish his sleepers key, as well as a Exquisite Velium Battlehammer which went to <b>Frunkle</b>. Also a couple of bits of dragonhorn, worked boots and matchless gauntlets. Oh and spell, can't remember what, sunstrike and some others. Demi-lich rotted as I was about to loot it...<br><br>All in all a constructive day.  Later all...<br></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>
