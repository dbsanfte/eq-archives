                This is essentially an ELP (Event Lotto Points System) and for the entirety of this, points will be referred to as as 'elp'.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#66FFCC" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>ITEM COST:<BR></B>
                </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">All items under an ELP system have a number value attached to them corresponding to their rarity and stat increases. Some are very cheap at only 1 elp, some (Robe of 
                Darkness / Mask of War) are expensive, at 75 points each. For exact points values refer to the list posted with formal rules. When you win an item this amount of points is deducted from your current ELP total.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#339999"
                 SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>EXAMPLE:</B> </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">You have 40elp, you win an item worth 15elp, your elp total is reduced by 15. Your new elp total is 25elp.
                <BR><BR>This ELP total is increased by attending raids and gaining points, and decreased by winning items.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#66FFCC" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>WINNING ITEMS<BR></B></FONT><FONT
                 SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">In order to make it so that one person is not guaranteed to win an item by sheer dint of having more points, there is a certain amount of randomness involved in a roll.&nbsp; For 
                each item, a person rolls 1 - 100. This roll is modified by your current elp total. For each point of elp you have in total you gain 5 to your random roll.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#339999" SIZE="-1"
                 FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>EXAMPLE:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">
                 An item worth 15ELP drops. PlayerA has 40elp, PlayerB has 45. In this case PlayerA adds 200, PlayerB adds 225. (simplifying) for the sake of ease in calculations this translates to player A needing to get 25 MORE in a roll than player B
                <BR><BR>PlayerA rolls 1-100 and gets 70<BR>PlayerB rolls 1-100 and gets 64<BR><BR>PlayerB has 5 more elp than PlayerA so adds 25 to his roll, for an adjusted total of 89.<BR>
                In this case PlayerB would win the item, and deduct 15elp from his current total of 45, giving him a new adjusted ELP total of 30.<BR><BR>Note that in this system a gap of 20 equates to +100 in a random roll. Should any one person 
                be over 20elp less than the person with the highest total elp:<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#339999" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>EXAMPLE:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">
                 PlayerA has 67elp total. PlayerB has 45elp total.<BR><BR>Then that person is unable to win the item - they cannot adjust their roll to be able to beat the higher player. If this should mean that noone can roll against a Player for 
                that item, then that player wins it automatically.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#66FFCC" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>ELP GRADING<BR></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">One of the 
                disadvantages of this system is a tendancy to encourage hoarding of points, and using this large total to force defaults. To stop this, once a player reaches a substantial points base his elp are given a multiplier so that it takes 
                more raid points for an actual point of elp.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a Player has reached 100ELP, all elp after that point are given a multiplier of *0.8. This is in affect until the person reaches 120elp, at this point the modifer 
                becomes *0.5. This makes it alot more beneficial for people to spend the points as well as harder for people to amass huge base totals.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#339999" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>EXAMPLE:
                </B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">
                 PlayerA has just gotten 102elp from his last raid. Next raid he gains 6elp. This 6 new elp are given a 0.8 multiplier. So adds 4.8 (6.0*0.8). To save on hassle all remainders are rounded up. So PlayerA then adds 5elp to his total of 102, for a new total of 107elp. If PlayerA gets to 120elp this modifier is increased to 0.5

                raids, as well as being present for at least a decent shot at the raid goal. Through out the raids those responsible for keeping track (at the moment Ranum but more will be added) will take logs of those in attendance every couple 
                of hours, the people whos names are on the logs will gain points. This is not perfect we know, but the alternative is to award points based solely on kills/attempts - a system that invariably leads to people only turning up for mob 
                kills, or not at all if they are only getting points for the death. Should it proove far to unweildy it may be changed at a later date.<BR>Points are as follows: <BR>+1 point for being present at the designated Start Time.<BR>
                +1 point for every time your Name appears on a 2hour /log<BR>+2 points for being present for 1+ boss mob kill, or 2+ attempts - this is awarded ONCE per raid, 2 kills or 4 attempts will NOT earn 4 points, you will still only get 
                the +2.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#339999" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>EXAMPLE:<BR></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">i) A Yelinak raid is posted for 5pm EST. PlayerA turns up 
                at 5pm, PlayerB turns up at 7:30pm EST. Over the course of the raid Yelinak is Attempted 4 times, and the raid finishes at 10pm EST. Attendance logs are taken every 2 hours, in this example at 7pm and 9pm. <BR><BR>PlayerA gets - +1 
                for being on at the start time. +2 for time spent (7pm and 9pm logs) and +2 for being at 2+ attempts. Total = 5elp for the raid<BR>
                PlayerB gets- +2 for time spent (7pm and 9pm logs) and +2 for being at 2+ attempts. Total = 4elp for raid<BR><BR>ii) A ToV raid starts at 6pm est. We kill 6 named, finish at 1am est. Logs are taken at the start and every 2 hours 
                after (8pm, 10pm, 12am). PlayerA arrives at 5pm and stays for the full duration. PlayerB arrives at start but leaves at 10pm. PlayerC arrives at 7pm and stays till end. PlayerD arrives at 8:30pm and leaves at 11pm.<BR><BR>
                PlayerA gets - +1 for being present at the start. +3 for being on for the duration. +2 for being present at 2+ attempts. Total = 6elp<BR>
                PlayerB gets - +1 for being present at start. +2 for being present for 2 of the logs. +2 for being present at 2+ attempts. Total = 5elp<BR>
                PlayerC gets - +3 for being present for all 3 logs. +2 for being present for 2+ attempts. Total = 5elp<BR>PlayerD gets - +1 for being present at 1 log. +2 assuming 2 mobs were attempted (or one killed) in that time. Total = 3elp.

                that drops, but it is silly to let it rot. In these cases it will be possible for people who wish to go into negative elp. In these cases the following rules apply.<BR>
                i) Someone who can afford the items true ELP value will never have to roll against someone who would go into negative for an item.<BR>
                ii) If all people who wish to roll for an item will be sent to negative elp the lotto is conducted as a normal elp lotto.<BR>iii) A person with positive ELP will always get first choice over a person already in negative<BR><BR>

                overwhelming suited to one or two in particular. These items have a modifier tied to them, and should a class who it is not overwhelmingly suited for choose to roll against one who it is suited for then it will in turn cost that 
                person more elp. The chances to win the item are the same - but the penalty you pay for getting the item earlier is a higher ELP cost.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#66FFCC" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><B>
                IMPROMPTU RAIDS<BR></B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Should a raid happen that was unplanned and unscheduled it will styill be worth points. An impromptu raid will give +3 points as a flat standard 
                for attendance. This will be awarded for basic participation. As the raids are both spur of the moment and unplanned there is no time set to this, logs will be taken within every 2 hours and should your name appear on a log you are 
                entitled to the points.</FONT><P ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT COLOR="#66FFCC" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">TWINK RULES<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
                 FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Should no main wish to pay the elp for the item, it will first be offered to any other mains present on the raid, should NO main in attendance on the raid wish the item, it will be open for 
                any twinks that wish to roll.&nbsp; Lottos for twinks will be conducted in exactly the same manner as lottos for mains, with the same points costs.&nbsp; It is the character's duty to have any twinks they wish to loot items in the 
                same zones and within relatively easy to get to position.</FONT></TD>
