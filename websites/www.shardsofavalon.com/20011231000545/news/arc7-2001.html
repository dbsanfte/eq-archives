After managing to train ourselves with him near shrooms.. and not being able to stop his gate fast enough... we rebuffed and killed him with 17 people... possibly the worst class make up we've ever had, too. Think it was 1 warrior, 2 rogues and 2 clerics.<br><br>Anyhoo, he dropped a Cobalt Breastplate, which went to <b> Frunkle </b>, who now has a full suit of cobalt. A ranger BP also dropped, which went to someone who I cant remember.... and he dropped 4 teeth for Huyn, Goguk, Some other dude, and one for multiquesting.<br><br>After Trakanon, we had a few more people on, so we headed over to Skyshrine to gank Yelinak. Well, Yelinak has been upgraded yet again, making him more annoying than ever. Managed to get him to 20%, but ran out of steam. He will die again some other time.<br><br>Then many hours later, the servers decided to come down again. Killed Venril Sathir on server up... mostly due to the fact we only had 12 people online.. We dont need 9 groups like some others... but hey, 'whatever works'. (Personal joke)<br><br>Venril had nice drops. He put out a stave to go towards <b> Gradie's </b> epic, a pair of Donals legs which went to <b> Brienaire </b>, who now has a full suit of Donals... and a pair of Elder Spiritists Legs that went to my bank for guildsale. Feel free to tell me with offers. Think we have some other stuff in there.. ES BPs and BE BPs and the like.<br><br>Well, the VS crew logged off, so 4 of us headed over to WW and layed waste to Myga, to finish the dragonsbane quest for <b> Gradie </b>. That's about it.</FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

We are starting to get this zone sorted now and this trip was a lot smoother than our last outing. We made it as far as Phara Dar, but an unexpected twist saw us lose to him.<br><br>Thanks to a botched pull we started this trip off with Hoshkar in the safe hall, unbuffed, unprepared and with none of the right resist gear on. Quick reactions from everyone (especially our clerics) and some well timed nuking when he tried his inevitable gate saw us standing over one very surprised dragon rather earlier than expected. Grats to <b>Shanodoa</b> on his <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/greysuedeboots.html target=new>Grey Suede boots</a></b>, <b>Melana</b> on her <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/feverblade.html target=new>Feverblade</a></b>, Aydindril (VS) who got a <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/robeofburningrage.html>Robe of Burning Rage</a></b> and to <b>Gradie</b> who looted the <b><a href=http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/fatesealer.html>Fatesealer</a></b>. Also congrats to Frunkle on the green scale - almost there fatty...<br><br>With Hoshkar out of the way Silverwing was just another speed hump. Neero (VS) made off with a <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/lyransmysticallute.html>Lyran's Mystical Lute</a></b> and <b>Emile</b> won the Lifetap Scimitar - cant for the life of me remember what it was called - ill edit this later with the proper name hehe. Enchanter Robe and Shaman Hammer were left to rot. We did a little maintenance for the rest of the evening and then camped out in order to finish up the next day.<br><br>Saturday started out early with a nice easy Xygoz fight. He dropped a <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/staffofnull.html>Staff of Null</a></b> which went to <b>Shandoa</b> and three <b><a href=http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/solistsrobeofinvocation.html>Solist's Robe's of Invocation</a></b> which went to <b>Aedalare</b>, <b>Xandar</b> and <b>Zortek</b>.<br>Next up came Druushk, who despite the pounding he gave us last time had neither help nor the element of surprise and went down smoothly and effortlessly. Two <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/sarnaksummonersstaff.html>Sarnak Summoner Staves</a></b> were left to rot ( I can hear the howls of mages across the globe in my sleep...). <b>Fayde</b> won the <b><a href=http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/skullcrusherofkragg.html>Skull Crusher of Kragg</a></b> and the <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/maelstrom.html>Maelstrom</a></b> went to <b>Frunkle</b>.<br>Nexona we hadnt tried before so we employed a slightly different tactic. While Frunkle was admiring his reflection in his shiney new Lammy look-a-like we pulled in Nexona and let him gorge himself on ogre. Needless to say it was too much ogre for that dragon and when he started to choke we lept in to finish him off. Sadly the ogre could not be rescued. We all must make sacrifices for the greater good.... Grats to Crazdem (VS) on his <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/robeofadversity.html>Robe of Adversity</a></b>, Neero (VS) on his <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/howlingcutlass.html>Howling Cutlass</b></a> and since noone really wanted it <b>Lionelies</b> looted the <b><a href=http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/ykeshanbroadaxe.html>Ykeshan Broad Axe</a></b><br><br>We took a couple shots at Phara, but with only 1 chanter and roboed at that we just didnt have the drain nor the time. We will see VP cleared next trip.....<br>No screenshot of Xygoz - i forgot to take one..<br><br><center><a href=/news/hoshkar.jpg><img src=/news/hoshkarTN.jpg border=0></a><a href=/news/silverwing.jpg><img src=/news/silverwingTN.jpg border=0></a><a href=/news/druushk.jpg><img src=/news/druushkTN.jpg border=0></a><a href=/news/nexona.jpg><img src=/news/nexonaTN.jpg border=0></a><br></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>
