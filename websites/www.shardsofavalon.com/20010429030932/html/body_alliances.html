                policy/agreement between SoA and all of its allies. </FONT></TD>

                </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Priority for equipment will be given to primary characters. A secondary character will not be allowed to obtain an item that a primary does not have unless the 
                primary character does not want the item or agrees to go against them in a /random lotto. <P>In situations when all characters involved in lotto belongs to the same guild, the guild's own looting policies may apply and take 
                precedence over the multi-guild loot rules. It is also each guild's discretion to re-allocate equipment won by a member of their guild according to their own loot policies.<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>2. One Item Each per Raid <BR><BR></B>Each 
                person will only be eligible to get one piece of equipment per raid, unless each player of the same class has already gotten an item. This rule does not override Rule #1, i.e. as long as a primary character needs an item, the 
                secondary character has to yield.<BR><BR>Obviously, there will be cases where an item will drop (usually pertains to lore items) and the people who have not yet gotten anything already have it, hence it will be lotto'ed or given to 
                those who can use it even if they already got something during the raid.<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>3. Late Arrivals<BR><BR></B>There will be no enforced &quot;waiting period&quot; before someone can be eligible for lottos when they joined a 
                raid late. However, it would be proper courtesy to yield to those who were there first and wait a sufficient amount of time before participating in lottos.<BR><BR>As an example, you joined a Hate raid that has been several hours in 
                progress. There are 3 other players of same class as you and a class item dropped 10 minutes after you joined. Since there is no &quot;waiting period&quot; and the item dropped when you were there, you are eligible to go in lotto 
                for it, but it would be rather nice if you concede to the other 3 players and refrain from entering lottos until you believe you've contributed enough to deserve a claim to items.<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>4. Playing Secondaries<BR><BR></B>
                You may bring your secondary characters during raids and still have your primary character eligible to participate in lottos. But as per Rule #1, you cannot obtain an item ahead of any primary characters unless they are extras or 
                they let you have it or you're the only one who can use the no drop item (unless the primary character is present but playing a secondary character and can login the primary in time to loot it). As much as possible, everyone is 
                expected to play their primary characters during raids, but we all need variety and do not want to play the same character every time, hence playing secondaries is not prohibited. There are also times when you will be asked to 
                bring your secondary character by the raid leader and in those situations, you have special rights as discussed in Rule #5.<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>5. Primary Character Rights for Secondary Character </B><P>There are times when you will be 
                asked to bring a secondary character in a raid because they are required classes and no primary character is available. This would give you an exception to rule #1 if you will be unable to participate in class lottos for your 
                primary character. This is normally not a problem for Fear or Hate since the primary character can be brought to the vicinity of the area, but may be in an issue in Sky or dragon raids (with no drop items).<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>
                6. Pseudo-secondary Character Cases</B><P>There is no standard rule for miscellaneous cases like &quot;pseudo-secondary&quot; i.e. 2 primary characters being played by 1 person, since I don't think it possible. But as a general 
                rule, any deviations from the loot policy has to be agreed upon by the classes affected.<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>7. Last Piece Rule</B><P>This is not enforced, but encouraged. If someone only needs 1 more item to complete their suit of 
                armor, it is asked that others of the same class yield the item by default. Nothing is more frustrating than being out of several lottos since one already has the item and losing a lotto on the last item you need. Others will have 
                lots more chances of getting items anyway since they will be duplicates. It is understandable if you do not agree to yield on Breastplates or Robes.<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>8. Breastplates and Robes</B><P>The main piece of each suit of 
                armor will not default to a person by virtue of Rule #2. BPs and Robes will be lotto'ed to those who need it, including those who have already won a &quot;minor&quot; piece. e.g. 2 clerics needing a BP, first cleric won boots, and 
                afterwards a Cleric BP drops. 2nd cleric DOES NOT get the breastplate by default but instead lotto'ed, unless first cleric yields.<BR>&nbsp;<P><B>9. Passing and defaulting on items<BR><BR></B>There are several cases of this:<BR><BR>
                a. If you went in lotto and you end up winning, then decided to give to someone else, then the item will still be credited to you. It was your choice to give it up. The recipient will not be excluded in further lottos but you will 
                be.<BR><BR>b. If a class plane armor drops, and you don't have it, but you think it &quot;sucks&quot; and passed on it, and it ended up defaulting to someone, then the recipient does not get excluded in further lottos. You will 
                still be eligible for further lottos.<BR><BR>c. If an item goes to a person by default and it is generally viewed as a &quot;crap&quot; item, the recipient does not get excluded in further lottos. Now this may be a bit subjective 
                as we all have different views of what are good items and what aren't and may be abused. But as an example, 2 enchanters in a raid and insidious slippers dropped, 1st enchanter already has it hence it defaulted to 2nd enchanter. 
                Afterwards, an insidious halo dropped, the 2nd enchanter will still be eligible to be in lotto for it. <BR>&nbsp;<P><B>10. Special Loot Rules for Unique, Rare or &quot;Uber&quot; Items<BR><BR></B>Random lotto is the easiest and 
                ofttimes fair way to distribute loot, but sometimes it isn't the right way to do it especially for unique or &quot;uber items&quot;. There will be cases when loot has to be decided by merit and given to the deserving people 
                involved in the raid. This will reduce the instances of bad lottos, i.e. &quot;winning an uber item by pure luck and without investing sufficient time and effort to help the guild and deserve the item&quot;. Special Loot Rules for 
                the raid will be announced ahead of time by the organizer.<P>Revised: 11 October, 2000</FONT><P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;</TD>
