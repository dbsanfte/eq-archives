                <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">In order to improve our ability to add quality members and give them the opportunity to meet existing members the following procedure will succeed the previously existing 
                application process:<P>1) The applicant must meet the posted requirements for membership before advancing to the next step.<P>2) The applicant must find 2 people to sponsor him/her.&nbsp; The easiest way to accomplish this is to 
                either have prior friendship with members or to group with members in a group environment.&nbsp; It will be the responsibility of these two members to provide scheduling information for the applicant so that he/she has access to 
                members in a raid environment.&nbsp; Both members must maintain communication so that the applicant is properly informed.<P>3) The sponsor will either forward an application to the officer in charge of recruitment (Zammel) or post 
                it to the "SoA Recruitment" board and have a board admin lock the thread.<P>4) For approximately 1-4 weeks at the discretion of the sponsor, the applicant will need to group with members and attends raids with sponsors 
                support.&nbsp; The applicant may be added to guildchat for raid coordination though it is expected they will remove themselves shortly after each raid.
                <UL>
                    <P>a) This period is similar to the previous period of temporary membership and/or the pre-application period.&nbsp; Temporary membership is no longer an option on voting thus it is important to group and raid together 
                    frequently during this period.<P>b) Often grouping with others improves the chances of entering the guild after voting is completed so it is advised the applicant and sponsor give sufficient time before opening the voting 
                    process.
                </UL>
                <P>5) Once a satisfactory period of grouping has occurred the sponsor will have the application unlocked by an officer and a second person/sponsor will need to second the application before anyone else responds with comments.<P>6) 
                After sufficient time for comment, all guild officers will make the final decision on the applicant and post the result to the thread and contact the applicant with the result.</FONT><P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;</TD>
