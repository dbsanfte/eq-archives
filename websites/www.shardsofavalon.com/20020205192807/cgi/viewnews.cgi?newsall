We had just finished CoHing some kos people when the broadcast came, Xegony down in 15 minutes!<br>So we buffed up as efficiently as possible, killed the surrounding giants, set ourselves a cleric and tank order and pulled Vindicator. He went down smoothly, with a little scare of "World Coming down, Please logout now" when he was around 25% hp. He dropped a pair of booties, which went to Poppn(IS).<br><br>Servers came down, and upon their coming back up, we logged on and whacked Vindicator again. This time he dropped a Chestplate of Vindication for .... ME!. Now not only do i have to carry around 3 breastplates, and put up with wankers asking for hammer, i have to sub in breastplates constantly! Hooray.<br><br>Statue was next on the list, and he turned out to be a quad hitter, and dropped our main tank whilst clerics stood by and laughed. We transitioned pretty nicely... our second warrior died while the clerics laughed.<br>The third tank stuck for a bit though, and then we got slow and crap in , and its kinda hard to not win from there. <br>He put out 2 Swiftblade's of Zek for Guildfunds, and a Cloak of Falling Stars for <b>Lemieux</b>.<br><br>We then raced back to Tormax, for fear of being pnp'ed, and killed him again, in an interesting fight with a bit of a skeleton crew. The fight lasted about twice as long as normal, with clerics going oom when Tormax was around 40% hp. Nevertheless, we won, and this time he put out a Horn of Hsagra for guildfund (tell me!), a head for FT2 booties for Sybian (Elp hoarder), a Crown of Kromzek Kings for Thuel (IS) - Not happy... i lost the lotto for guild looting rights, with a roll of 99 when Gathu rolled a 100 (hate you), and a Wristguard of Thunder for.... Zaing? (IS), and an axe which rotted i believe.<br><br>All in all, a fairly fun day, and get out of ntov :(<br></center></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

All in all, we had a blast. First up we faced Order of the Phoenix, from Saryrn server. We beat them flawlessly, and that was it for day 1, due to the fact ToT3 was running about 6 hours behind schedule. Fun.<br><br>Day Two saw us come up against the guild Cats in Hats, from the Drinal server. They were also beaten flawlessly, although they did not field a full 18 players. We knew our next match would be tough, as it was against the winner of the Ascending Dawn (Rallos Zek) vs Legacy of Steel (The Nameless) match. Well, Rallos beat LoS around 15-12 i believe it was, and we knew we had our toughest match yet coming up.<br><br>The Rallos fight was long, but bloody. The majority of their team had Ivandyrs Hoops, and combined with two Shadowknights, this proved to be a deadly combination. The start of the match was called, about 20 seconds later, Zasper was golem wanded 5 times, HT'ed twice and Ivandyr Hooped to hell and back. Took him approximately one second to die, he didnt even have time to click his DA idol. Nadilx followed about 4 seconds later, as their team unloaded mass charges of hoops into Nadilx, followed by Warz. Probably only 60 seconds into the match, and we were down by 3. The carnage slowed a lot as they ran out of hoop charges. Brienaire died a few minutes later, followed by a slow trickle of deaths, probably one every 3 minutes.<br><br>A little surprise that wasn't known until the start of ToT3, was that due to it being held on Rallos, debuffs did 1.5x their normal effect. This made virtually anyone rootable with Tash + Malo + Occlusion, and a rooted person is a dead person. With Zasper down so quickly, we struggled to kill any RZ players, as they were also well equipped with Soulfires and Golem Wands. We lost to the Rallos Zek team, in what was a decent game.<br><br>We had fun, and in the end, we were beaten by the better team. They were better prepared than we were, and we had virtually no hoops. Its just a shame that the tournament was so right click reliant, as right clicking DD and heal items kind of kills lots of tactics. Whoever has the most right clicks, and uses them to their maximum effect, wins.<br><br>In retrospect, myself and many others wish the ruleset was different. In all honesty, Soulfires, Hoops, Insta heal shaman potions etc should have been banned. Right click DD and heal items make PvP a very silly game. Don't get me wrong, preparation is part of any ToT, and RZ were better prepared, and better pvp'ers than we were. They deserved to win, and congratulations to them for their good tactics. <br><br>See you all for ToT4.</center><br><br><br><br></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

The clearing was long and boring, there are seriously too many mobs in that zone. One by one, sometimes ten by ten, the mobs fell. Sometimes it was 30 by 30, and we fell. But in the end, the zone was clear, and we buffed up for Tunare.<br><br>Our first attempt was pretty shocking. We made some strategy adjustments and vowed to stop sucking. The vow was broken on our second attempt, so we all camped and came back. The third attempt was the clincher... Tunare had 1 pixel of red left in her name, and we still managed to lose. Incredibly pissed off, we ressed in and returned with a vengeance. On our fourth shot, around 5:30am est, Tunare went down with ease.

Like 30 people in total i think. Well, we got Klown to 25%, but we died. So today we headed back with a decent sized raiding force, and waxed him effortlessly. Loot was some stuff, and the ST key went to Neero (VS).<br><br>Not satisfied, we ran across to ToV and laid waste to Sontalak. He dropped some more stuff, and the ST key went to Warz(IS).<br><br>After this, our numbers dwindled significantly, and no more ST dragons were alive, so we decided to take a trip down memory lane and slay Velketor, just for something to do. Well, we only had one warrior, and our damage output was pitiful, but due to a series of damn fast CHs and rangers tanking, we managed to slay the giant with sober, our only warrior, our only casulty. Loot was pretty crap, but thats a given with Velketor. <b>Flaen</b> picked up a crown, not sure what else happened with the loot. </center></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

In our second ever Vyemm fight (without his guards in assistance) everything came together in unison and Lord Vyemm, the biggest badass in ToV hit the dirt. Congratulations to all involved. Vyemm is a fast and hectic fight where the slightest errors can spell death. Thankfully all went according to plan and he was executed flawlessly, leaving the way clear to proceed to ToV's resident loot dispenser - Vulak' Aerr. Vulak is a looong fight. He has an assload of hp, with his AE he becomes a solid war of attrition. Even calling in support at the last moment from two drake buddies we still saw him off in what is currently the most fun fight I've had (I'm sure melee don't feel the same way hehe)<br><br>The end result has seen us clearing ToV way ahead of the curve. I don't think anyone expected us to be able to come together this hard and fast, nor to conquer each of these dragons in so fast a succession.

A homage to the greatest warrior of Temple of Veeshan's north wing..  FEESH!!! Yes that's right Lord Koi'Doken, the fearsome sea monster of Norrath. I was lucky enough to capture a picture of Feesh'Doken in all his glory, and you can view this rare glimpse at the bottom of the page. First off some of you may be unfamiliar with ol' Koi.. Lets start with his melee. Goddamn this fish knows how to throw down. He can rumble with the best of them at a pace unprecedented in EQ history. We were lucky enough to have enough clerics there to keep up with his awesome damage, and a big shout out to both of them for an awesome effort! Now being a dragon Doken is also blessed with an AE. All I can say is DAMN. It's hard enough fighting a mob that hits for this much, let alone having to deal with a killer AE at the same time, and when I fail to resist it you bet your life I'll be posting here moments later to tell you just how fearsome it is!! oh yeah.. it's called Tsunami. After a long and hard fought battle we finally overcame the awesome Agent we stood against and victory was ours. Feesh, we salute you <img src=/news/icon/icon41.gif> <br><br>Now of course one must fight ones way to this awesome powerhouse who, I think all will agree, is the TRUE king of EQ. Loot has been posted here and around the place, so I'm not gonna put up links to everything we got, if you're too lazy find it yourself, that ain't my problem!<br><br>Its a little unorthodox, but this is the order they were killed - so sue me. <br><br>First up was Jorrleag (long story and really not that interesting...). Um he's kinda Vox... he has more hp.... it doesnt matter, he's dead now. Earring of Icecaster went to Gathu(IS), Helm of the Crawler went to Adante(IS) and <b>Newmoon</b> scored some silver chains.<br><br>Next up was Nev. Frankly most of us agree that Nevedaria is one of the more fun fights in EQ, and as a caster I must say its pretty funny watching all your melee turning in circles. Mask of Terror went to Endar(OOK OOK), <b>Kegwell</b> scored her Right Eye and someone else got the Medal (I'm using IS's loot list - so sue me).<br>Next up came the gimp twins. This is one place where Risk versus Reward really lives up to its potential! They dropped some shields and slashers, grats people's bank. <br><br>Zlexac. Hoshkar on steroids. It went poorly the first shot (here's a tip, if you're really hurt, and run away, the dragon will follow), but second time produced the expected result. Congrats <b>Lemieux</b> on Dragon Skin Bracer.<br><br>Aaryonar. don't ask how, don't ask why. Something went wrong the first time, and we really aren't too sure what. Bunch of linkdeaths but shouldn't have made that much difference, just seemed to stall out on him. At any rate we had a chuckle about it, pulled him and Kicked his Face in. Dropped Mask of Fall for Demincia(IS) and Gwyndor(IS) got a Katana of Pain.<br><br>Next we moved out and came in through the door, while waiting for most people to turn up cleaned Ikatiar (I was one of the people who was late, so wasn't there for the fight..), was Ikatiar - no harm no foul. Grats Thalin(IS) on Stinger, Aztek(IS) on Mask.<br><br>Eashen came next and handed over a 2 sets of Twisted Steel Gauntlets, grats <b>Zammel</b> and Zasper. <br><br>Moved in and pulled Feshlak, with both his guards, a drake and a flurrier. swish.... After rezzes we pulled Feshlak. The symmetry. The flawless execution. The perfected nuking. Yes all these things were lacking and as the screenshot shows - this is not where you are meant to have Feshlack dead. Handed over Skywatcher Monacle for Yasuki(VS) and some Boots of the Dead Dream to gn0mer_01 Zasper(IS).<br><br>Dargan. Really a wurm just doesn't belong here. A big FU for not letting me DB your sorry ass and for that robe (really.. WTF???). <br><br>Grats to Durharm(IS) and <b>Werin</b> on Wurm Claw pauldrons. Loric(IS).. I s'pose grats on robe.. I'm so sorry....<br><br>Lord Kreizen. He's like Jorrleag... but with Naggy instead of Vox. Seriously this guy is s'posed to be one of the Big 4? Give me a break this gimp isn't fit to lick the dirt off Vyemm's boots.  Grats Sitten(IS) on the Silver Disc. <b>Sober</b> and Demincia(IS) got crappy Fire Etched Flamberges. <br><br>To the other side and the fight all of us were really there for. LORD KOI'DOKEN!!! Again a massive fight. Props to the Fish. We eventually downed him. Grats <b>Walcanar</b> and Fliplotar(IS) on Helms of the Deep Sea, and Starsparkles(IS) for the SirenSong.<br><br>Lady Mirenilla. A lot of anticipation as we fronted to the last Dragon in ToV before leaveing only _THE_MAN_ and his decrepit papa left. Still went down. Still gave lewtz. <b>Shandoa</b> got the Ebony headband, Fitch(IS) got the Orb of the Crimson Bull.<br><br>Well that left North ToV pretty much empty except for Vyemm and Vulak. Today we went back to give Vyemm a few decent runs. All kidding aside I would like to say a great big GODDAMN. Full respect to LoS on the Avatar of War. That melee with that many hp? anyone that can step up to that and drop it (I dont care how you do it) deserves respect. Vyemm is a powerhouse of rage. He is angry and he wants to share with everyone. Tried a few things, unfortunately got his guards mixed up in there. Lowest we got him was about 75%. But we learnt a whole lot, and pretty sure we can fix his little red wagon soon. Time will tell. Vulak count your days, soon as your bully boy drops we gonna knock you the F*&K out.<br><br>Screenshots, um yeah - dead things:<br><a href=/news/aary2.jpg><img src=/news/TNaary2.jpg border=0 target=new></a><a href=/news/feshlak2.jpg><img src=/news/TNfeshlak2.jpg target=new border=0></a><a href=/news/feesh.jpg><img src=/news/TNfeesh.jpg target=new border=0></a><a href=/news/feeshdead.jpg><img src=/news/TNfeeshdead.jpg target=new border=0></a></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

We made it as far as Phara Dar, but an unexpected twist saw us lose to him.<br><br>Thanks to a botched pull we started this trip off with Hoshkar in the safe hall, unbuffed, unprepared and with none of the right resist gear on. Quick reactions from everyone (especially our clerics) and some well timed nuking when he tried his inevitable gate saw us standing over one very surprised dragon rather earlier than expected.

For the past couple of weeks we have been making mild attempts to see what lay beyond our good friend Arraken, usually withmixed results. But today it came together and for the first time on Xegony Ikatiar the Venomed was slain! He was a fun fight, despite a slight hiccup at the start with agro. Congratulations to Regents (IS) on his new <b><a href=http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/maskofvenom.shtml target=new>Mask of Venom</a></b> and to Marika (VS) on her, er shiney? new <b><a href=http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/poisonsoakedtunic.shtml target=new>Poison Soaked Tunic</a></b>.<br><br>Along the way we also picked up a Plate Bp for <b>Ranum</b> and a Leather Tunic for <b>Werin</b>, finishing his set (leather drops are just too damn high for only two classes to use), grats!<br><br>After we had seen to Ikatiar our next stop was Eashan of the Sky. A named drake that lurks before the first dragon. We all got our first look at what lay ahead as well with out first glimpse of the ancient wyrmm Aaryonar. We couldnt get too close but i included a pic of what we did see. Our fight with Eashan was a learning experience, we had no idea what to expect or what strategy would best defeat him, but in the end despite an atrocious start we got him to some 15% health (he was at around the Eas when the last of us died). Next time he will die. At this point id like to give a hearty FU to whoever at Verant came up with those Hatchlings... very... very....... annoying. By this time it was well late in the night, and after an unfortunate accident our CR party got wiped, we decided to call it a night. We shall be returning soon to finish what we started, no doubt Eashan will be hanging at the temple pub this evening making himself sound like a big man to all his dragon mates about how he saw us off. Well you just wait buddy, you just wait.... cause your gonna get yours, you mark my words!! <br><br>Oh yeah pictures.. nothing much since lets face it we all seen Wyverns before and i didnt get a shot of Eashan (will get one next time), so i included what we saw from the main hall.<br><br><center><a href=/news/ikatiar.jpg target=new><img src=/news/ikatiarTHUMB.jpg border=0><a href=/news/aaryonar.jpg target=new><img src=/news/aaryonarTHUMB.jpg border=0> </FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

So it was already well late in the day by the time we got to Xygoz. He was a total gimp and went down in no time, I think he managed to kill two people (one being me - I knew resisting silence was going to bite me in the ass).<br><br>Next up we spent some time figuring out how to get Druushk in. Thanks to a 2 hour experimentation when he actually did come people were afk and totally unprepared, leading to a spectacular opening which only got better when he agroed a nearby wurm. After cr we again had trouble pulling him, unfortunately when we did get him we tried to get our casters to dodge his AE, the result being a whole lot of dead casters and three free AE's for Druushk. By this time it was way, way too late so we left VP, but we will return armed with what we learnt this time and we expect our next trip to be <b>alot</b> smoother.<br><br>Here are some pics. I didn't have one of Hoshkar (I was dead <img src=/news/icon/icon11.gif> ) and no one sent me one (watch me get 6 in my next email check), nor a picture of Druushk, but I got a really nice one of Xygoz and included a nice landscape.<br><center><a href=/news/xygoz.jpg target=new><img src=/news/xygozTHUMB.jpg border=0></a> <a href=/news/xygozdead.jpg target=new><img src=/news/xygozdeadTHUMB border=0></a> <a href=/news/pitroom.jpg target=new><img src=/news/pitroomTHUMB.jpg border=0></a></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

First up came Trakanon. Normally he'd be a total gimp and barely worth the mention, but I figure why not. Headed in at around 3am est with a grand total of 14 people from SoA and IS, 3 of them roboed. Got a few more and were sitting around in reet room after moping up protector and decided we couldn't be bothered waiting two more hours for people when we could just try now and if we failed we'd have more by the time cr was done. Well we kicked his ass. In the end I think we used a grand total of 17 actual people, the only two casualties being Sitten who got Trak-touched and me cause, well I was the only wizard casting Lure of Ice (Thxs extreme agro!). Loot was as always jaw dropping (haha). We got 6 teeth which are what we were really after, went towards finishing up some key Veeshans Peak er... keys... Also dropped <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/mannarobe.html target=new>Manna Robe</a> which went to Furzen (IS) and, since it wouldn't be Trak without one, another <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bloodemberbreastplate.html target=new>Blood Ember Breastplate</a> which is currently sitting on Ranum's Ranadin-wanna-be sk twink. While we're at it, anyone wanna buy a BE bp? hehe.<br><br>Next day stuck with naught to do, we were going to try Dain with IS, but we had a shortage of people and no real puller so instead we decided to pay a visit everyones favorite gimp giant (no not Derekor the other one). Despite a total lack of any real effort by anyone he still dropped like the gimp he is and disgorged his usual trove of rather sad caster loot. Grats to <b>Gradie</b> on his new click toy, a <a href=http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/vermillionorboftorrefaction.html target=new>Vermillion Orb of Torrefaction</a> and to Cyrinishad (IS) on his new <a href=http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/new/equipment/lazy/velketorsspellbook.shtml target=new>Velketor's Spell Book</a> and <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/bootsofbladecalling.jpg target=new>Boots of Bladecalling</a><br><br>Today saw us returning once again to the Halls of Phara'Dar and giving Veeshans Peak another run. We've had a slight shortage of keys lately so we needed to get a few more done, now that we have enough it's back we go. Well first up is, as always, Silverwing. As always the pull took sixty times longer than the fight. Lucky us Silverwing decided to test out her gate spell this time 'round. Hooray for camping. Only up side was she at least had the good taste to summon Frunkle, and its always funny to watch a cleric trying to melee a warrior, its just sad to have the cleric actually HURT the warrior...<br><br>At any rate after logging back in and rezzing our poor summonees (yes I know it's not a word) we went again with the predictable result of one dead dragon. Another fine display of balance and forethought from Verant, loot was as follows. Grats to <b>Zammel</b> and <b>Marlana</b> who each recieved a <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/hammerofthedragonborn.html target=new>Hammer of the Dragonborn</a>. Can someone explain to me why it wont stack with agility? Congratulations also to Norl (VS) on his uber <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/dragonclawmaingauche.html target=new>Dragon Claw Main Gauche</a> and <b>Emile</b> on his <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bluedflowerkatana.html target=new>Blue Flower Katana</a>. Thanks Silverwing, while your loot is ass, it's always a pleasure killing you.<br><br>We started late, so by this time it was already around 10:30pm but we decided to have a quick shot at Hoshkar before we logged for the night. Since this was only our second trip to VP and the first time Hoshkar handed us our ass (we were just totally unprepared for him heh) we decided to give him a whirl in safe corridor in order to see if we could get him to gate health and if we could we'd fight him in his lair. Well Hoshkar proved a total bunyip to pull. In total it took us about 45-50 minutes to get him solo. I'd like at this point to say that i have discovered the worst way to lose in EQ. It is when you <i>know</i> the mob is going to gate, but you're not sure if you can win, then winning emphatically and watching victory slip from your grasp as the dragon does exactly what you expected and gates... Being the lucky recipient of the first post-gate summon I got to watch Hoshkar with NO red left in his name summon me and kill me. he then proceeded to wipe others out one by one. By this time it was too late to actually finish him off, but you better believe we will be back there tomorrow, getting past this mofo and seeing if we can't pay a visit to a few of the other denizens of this dragon infested hovel. Tomorrow the saga continues.<br><br>Also I know it's a long ass update heh, just read what you want and gloss over the rest <img src=/news/icon/icon41.gif> <p><br><center><a href=/news/trak18.jpg target=new><img src=/news/trak18THUMB.jpg border=0></a> <a href=/news/velkdead.jpg target=new><img src=/news/velkdeadTHUMB.jpg border=0></a> <a href=/news/swdead.jpg target=new><img src=/news/swdeadTHUMB.jpg border=0></a> <br><br></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

But here we are and there he lay. At around 11pm EST Sontalak had assumed the position and coughed up his talisman. A combined effort by <b> Shards of Avalon</b>, <b>Venator Sapentia</b> and <b>Illuminati Sancti</b> exerted their authoritah and broke this pug faced freak in half. <br><br>It was never going to be an easy fight, took us three tries. First time 'round we weren't really prepared for the amount of sheer damage output he can pour into a buffless warrior and before he had lost a fifth of his health Sitten went down squealing.

My dismay turned to incredulous disbelief to zone back in and see Sontalak walking back to his guard post with <b>NO red left in his name!!!</b><br><br>Gentle reader this catastrophe could <b>not</b> be allowed to stand. Regrouping and rebuffing ourselves we were soon ready to engage once more. Tragically the pull went horribly wrong when Sontalak failed to kill Calek at the start but we quickly recovered from our horror. Getting stuck in like the angry midget he is Sitten took charge while our clerics pumped every little scrap of mojo they couldn into his beaten body. All was going well when disaster struck. Realising that this was his final chance Sontalak invoked the dreaded lag gods and cause a server spike that threw everyone out. Combining with his enraged attack Sontalak made a final last gasp effort, slaying many brave warriors. But it was too little, too late for the mighty red beast as with a final few swipes to take some casters and rangers with him he came crashing to the ground for the first time ever on Xegony...<br><br>Let the Temple of Veeshan farmers rejoice! For no longer must they suffer under the heel of this tyrant when farming for phat lewtz! The way to Temple of Farming is clear for all and will undoubtedly be packed by people who would normally never have gone while Sontalak lived.<br><br>It was Sontalak so hopes were never high for the booty haul. In a remarkable show of good taste he dropped his Talisman for Thuel (IS) to finish his sleepers key, as well as a Exquisite Velium Battlehammer which went to <b>Frunkle</b>. Also a couple of bits of dragonhorn, worked boots and matchless gauntlets. Oh and spell, can't remember what, sunstrike and some others. Demi-lich rotted as I was about to loot it...<br><br>All in all a constructive day.  Later all...<br></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

First we went and paid a visit to everyones favorite poison breather Trakanon and after a few exchanged words he handed over one Donal's BP (congrats Moosius-VS), one Mrylokar BP (grat's bank) and 6 teeth that went to <b>Myrnia</b>, <b>Vandu</b>, <b>Julien</b>, Klaget-VS, Balladar-DK and Bodan-DK. Now go get your keys guys!<br><br>After Trakonan was tucked in we decided to pay a long overdue visit to the terror of the dreadlands Gorenaire.  The last run in we had with her resulted in a win to the dragon. Eager to put one up on the scoreboard for us we geared up and let rip. When the smoke cleared the old white lay in the dust (or in my case suspended in the air - for some wierd reason the dragon was a human...)<br><br><center><a href="/news/gorenaire_fight.jpg" target=new border=0><img src="/news/tn_gorenaire_fight.jpg" border=0></a></center><br><br>CONGRATULATIONS to <b>Newmoon</b> on the completion of her epic! We were also lucky enough to garner one of Gore's prized tomes which went to <b>Fenar</b> for the continued glory of paladins everywhere! (see I even said that with a straight face. <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT>) Also congrats go out to Sebasttian-DK who got the drums she dropped. The rest of the loot (warhammer/Orb of Tishan) went to twinks, so they dont get a mention <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT><br><br>Still eager to lay the smack down we did yet another patented hot-drop in to our favorite Wakening Lands scaley Wuoshi. The high point of this fight being Fuego zoned so slowly he missed the whole thing.  Surprisingly the drops weren't total crap for a change.  We got a bow, crescent blade and 2 shields, as well as 1 scale. Unfortunately at the time I was checking for Severilous in EJ, and only got back in time to find out that Orbin-DK won the emerald scale <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT><br><br>By now it was getting on but we decided since Kael was only the next zone over we would go and see what we could do about making Derakor the Vindicator's life interesting.  Unfortunately against Derakor we hit a brick wall. After three tries we called it a night, but we learnt alot from him. Our best effort getting him to 40% with all our warriors dead in the first 20 seconds lol. Still we are pretty sure we have it sussed now and will be returning in the very near future to prove our point. Derakor, mark it off on your calendar, your time is due...<br><br>Overall a very busy night, unfotunately a little overshadowed by that giant pain (^ ^) Derekor. But any way you slice it, three dragons in one night is a good effort. I'll see what I can do about getting the drops from Wuoshi posted tomorrow too hehe.<br><br>Stay Safe all, see you in game.  </FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

Their reasoning?  See Callain&#8217;s response when I talked to him about it.<br><br><CENTER><IMG SRC="/news/hl_leapfrog.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="Callain of Havenlight speaks up"></CENTER><br><br>So basically, since they don&#8217;t want to give up Trakanon unless a guild is already at Trakanon&#8217;s Lair with 30-something people, should we expect to be bulldozed by Havenlight members each time we want to do Trakanon same day as them, even if we form and got rolling on the Juggernaut break earlier than they do??<br><br>We ended up dying eventually, not too many people can survive &#8216;shrooms and ilis when healers and chanters are at 20% mana, and since we aren&#8217;t the kind of people that enjoy fighting and training others to get a spawn we want, we just gave up and left.  This is the second time this kind of dispute happened and as usual, no response from Gwidion, guildleader of Havenlight, when asked to settle issues peacefully.  Had the situation been reversed and we found out that HL already had a break-in group at Ilis jails headed to Trak, you can bet we&#8217;ll leave &#8216;em alone.</FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>
