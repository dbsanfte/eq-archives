We really need a new stomping ground.<br><br>Other than that not much to tell, we whacked Trak the other day with waaay too many people, 40ppl he must have lasted a whole 5 seconds.. almost feel sorry for him if he wasn't such a gimp. People got teeth, and there was much rejoicing. Think Walcanar finally upgraded his EM. Don't know what it is but more clerics seem to hang onto their Planar armour than any other class...<br><br>Oh well enough of this rambling nonsense. I'll do a proper update with Vulak lewtz after he is dead, he is so a puppet king. All Hail Lord Vyemm, he's like one of those shifty little guys from bad sword and sorcery pictures always hiding behind the throne, driving the good king mad...unfortunately the only way to pry the treasury key free is from his cold dead hands.

The halls of North ToV is empty save for a couple of wurms, the occasional drake and those DAMN flurries. Really not much to tell. Pretty much every fight went as planned. There was a slight Feshlak related hiccup, but overall pretty smooth. We are starting to get a good grip on the most efficient way to work through. Over the course of 3 days we picked up a heap of stuff, quite frankly I've long since stopped marking down who got what, it's just too time consuming. So for all those who like lewt you will have to make do with merely what we got off Vulak, he's the only one that matter really anyway - right?<br><br>Congrats to <b>Sober</b> on the Cord of Velocity, Zeltar(IS) on the Armbands of Artistry and Durham Cat-man(IS) got a shiney new pair of Gauntlets of Might.<br><br>Screenies are of our favorite pair of homies, Vulak and Vyemm. The third one is a tribute to Kreizenn. This guy is one of the big 4, up there with Vulak, Vyemm and Zlexac. All I can say is.. HOW. Kreizenn, we salute your big talkin', hall strutting, hot air blowing self. How you gimped Vulak into making you one of his cronies I'll never know. Go help Wuoshi guard WL portal, k?<br><br>Till next time.<br><center><br><a href=/news/vyemm2.jpg><img src=/news/TNvyemm2.jpg target=new border=0></a><a href=/news/vulak2.jpg><img src=/news/TNvulak2.jpg target=new border=0></a><a href=/news/kreiz2.jpg><img src=/news/TNkreiz2.jpg target=new border=0></a></center></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

In our second ever Vyemm fight (without his guards in assistance) everything came together in unison and Lord Vyemm, the biggest badass in ToV hit the dirt. Congratulations to all involved. Vyemm is a fast and hectic fight where the slightest errors can spell death. Thankfully all went according to plan and he was executed flawlessly, leaving the way clear to proceed to ToV's resident loot dispenser - Vulak' Aerr. Vulak is a looong fight. He has an assload of hp, with his AE he becomes a solid war of attrition. Even calling in support at the last moment from two drake buddies we still saw him off in what is currently the most fun fight I've had (I'm sure melee don't feel the same way hehe)<br><br>The end result has seen us clearing ToV way ahead of the curve. I don't think anyone expected us to be able to come together this hard and fast, nor to conquer each of these dragons in so fast a succession. To all those people who said Xegony would be the last of the servers to clear North Wing - BZZZZ. Wrong.<br><br><center><a href=/news/vyemmdead.jpg><img src=/news/TNvyemmdead.jpg target=new border=0></a><a href=/news/vulakdead.jpg><img src=/news/TNvulakdead.jpg target=new border=0></a></center><br><br>Yes there was loot to be had. Congrats to Sybian(VS) and Hazenson(IS) who each got a left eye from Vyemm (freak dragon..). Lomark scored his Right eye. Vulak put out a Kelciferous Armband which went to Loric(IS), a pair of Sirrans Boots of Insanity which I (<b>Aedalare</b>) won and a Zeriphra Dagger of Blood which Thalin(IS) was forced to take!</FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

A homage to the greatest warrior of Temple of Veeshan's north wing..  FEESH!!! Yes that's right Lord Koi'Doken, the fearsome sea monster of Norrath. I was lucky enough to capture a picture of Feesh'Doken in all his glory, and you can view this rare glimpse at the bottom of the page. First off some of you may be unfamiliar with ol' Koi.. Lets start with his melee. Goddamn this fish knows how to throw down. He can rumble with the best of them at a pace unprecedented in EQ history. We were lucky enough to have enough clerics there to keep up with his awesome damage, and a big shout out to both of them for an awesome effort! Now being a dragon Doken is also blessed with an AE. All I can say is DAMN. It's hard enough fighting a mob that hits for this much, let alone having to deal with a killer AE at the same time, and when I fail to resist it you bet your life I'll be posting here moments later to tell you just how fearsome it is!! oh yeah.. it's called Tsunami. After a long and hard fought battle we finally overcame the awesome Agent we stood against and victory was ours. Feesh, we salute you <img src=/news/icon/icon41.gif> <br><br>Now of course one must fight ones way to this awesome powerhouse who, I think all will agree, is the TRUE king of EQ. Loot has been posted here and around the place, so I'm not gonna put up links to everything we got, if you're too lazy find it yourself, that ain't my problem!<br><br>Its a little unorthodox, but this is the order they were killed - so sue me. <br><br>First up was Jorrleag (long story and really not that interesting...). Um he's kinda Vox... he has more hp.... it doesnt matter, he's dead now. Earring of Icecaster went to Gathu(IS), Helm of the Crawler went to Adante(IS) and <b>Newmoon</b> scored some silver chains.<br><br>Next up was Nev. Frankly most of us agree that Nevedaria is one of the more fun fights in EQ, and as a caster I must say its pretty funny watching all your melee turning in circles. Mask of Terror went to Endar(OOK OOK), <b>Kegwell</b> scored her Right Eye and someone else got the Medal (I'm using IS's loot list - so sue me).<br>Next up came the gimp twins. This is one place where Risk versus Reward really lives up to its potential! They dropped some shields and slashers, grats people's bank. <br><br>Zlexac. Hoshkar on steroids. It went poorly the first shot (here's a tip, if you're really hurt, and run away, the dragon will follow), but second time produced the expected result. Congrats <b>Lemieux</b> on Dragon Skin Bracer.<br><br>Aaryonar. don't ask how, don't ask why. Something went wrong the first time, and we really aren't too sure what. Bunch of linkdeaths but shouldn't have made that much difference, just seemed to stall out on him. At any rate we had a chuckle about it, pulled him and Kicked his Face in. Dropped Mask of Fall for Demincia(IS) and Gwyndor(IS) got a Katana of Pain.<br><br>Next we moved out and came in through the door, while waiting for most people to turn up cleaned Ikatiar (I was one of the people who was late, so wasn't there for the fight..), was Ikatiar - no harm no foul. Grats Thalin(IS) on Stinger, Aztek(IS) on Mask.<br><br>Eashen came next and handed over a 2 sets of Twisted Steel Gauntlets, grats <b>Zammel</b> and Zasper. <br><br>Moved in and pulled Feshlak, with both his guards, a drake and a flurrier. swish.... After rezzes we pulled Feshlak. The symmetry. The flawless execution. The perfected nuking. Yes all these things were lacking and as the screenshot shows - this is not where you are meant to have Feshlack dead. Handed over Skywatcher Monacle for Yasuki(VS) and some Boots of the Dead Dream to gn0mer_01 Zasper(IS).<br><br>Dargan. Really a wurm just doesn't belong here. A big FU for not letting me DB your sorry ass and for that robe (really.. WTF???). <br><br>Grats to Durharm(IS) and <b>Werin</b> on Wurm Claw pauldrons. Loric(IS).. I s'pose grats on robe.. I'm so sorry....<br><br>Lord Kreizen. He's like Jorrleag... but with Naggy instead of Vox. Seriously this guy is s'posed to be one of the Big 4? Give me a break this gimp isn't fit to lick the dirt off Vyemm's boots.  Grats Sitten(IS) on the Silver Disc. <b>Sober</b> and Demincia(IS) got crappy Fire Etched Flamberges. <br><br>To the other side and the fight all of us were really there for. LORD KOI'DOKEN!!! Again a massive fight. Props to the Fish. We eventually downed him. Grats <b>Walcanar</b> and Fliplotar(IS) on Helms of the Deep Sea, and Starsparkles(IS) for the SirenSong.<br><br>Lady Mirenilla. A lot of anticipation as we fronted to the last Dragon in ToV before leaveing only _THE_MAN_ and his decrepit papa left. Still went down. Still gave lewtz. <b>Shandoa</b> got the Ebony headband, Fitch(IS) got the Orb of the Crimson Bull.<br><br>Well that left North ToV pretty much empty except for Vyemm and Vulak. Today we went back to give Vyemm a few decent runs. All kidding aside I would like to say a great big GODDAMN. Full respect to LoS on the Avatar of War. That melee with that many hp? anyone that can step up to that and drop it (I dont care how you do it) deserves respect. Vyemm is a powerhouse of rage. He is angry and he wants to share with everyone. Tried a few things, unfortunately got his guards mixed up in there. Lowest we got him was about 75%. But we learnt a whole lot, and pretty sure we can fix his little red wagon soon. Time will tell. Vulak count your days, soon as your bully boy drops we gonna knock you the F*&K out.<br><br>Screenshots, um yeah - dead things:<br><a href=/news/aary2.jpg><img src=/news/TNaary2.jpg border=0 target=new></a><a href=/news/feshlak2.jpg><img src=/news/TNfeshlak2.jpg target=new border=0></a><a href=/news/feesh.jpg><img src=/news/TNfeesh.jpg target=new border=0></a><a href=/news/feeshdead.jpg><img src=/news/TNfeeshdead.jpg target=new border=0></a></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>
