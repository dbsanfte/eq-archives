The raid was mildly eventful (plenty of unneeded loot decayed while clearing up to his lair as usual), until Innoruuk was aggro&#8217;ed and pulled inadvertently.  Unprepared, caught in a bad spot, and unable to slow down his attacks, we still battled him down to 50% HP until all clerics ran out of mana and tanks started dropping fast.   The second attempt was very successful and was a near perfect assault (3 or 4 deaths at most), largely attributed to getting him positioned properly and being able to successfully land a slow debuff on him (Thanks to Kinna of Cognatus for providing Malo services).  Good job to everyone involved!<br><br><CENTER><A HREF="/news/innoruuk_fight.jpg" target=new border=0><IMG SRC="/news/tn_innoruuk_fight.jpg" BORDER=0></A><br>Innoruuk battles SoA/VS</CENTER><br><br>Treasure Trove: Bloodstar Pendant, Brewer&#8217;s Mesh Cloak, Skinner&#8217;s Belt, Ring of Pureblood, 2x Eye of Innoruuk<br><br>Congrats to Raethen-VS (pendant), <b>Kegwell</b> (cloak), <b>Zammel</b> (belt), and Klaget-VS (ring).

Too bad he didn&#8217;t drop the Gnarled Staff that Nadil needed to complete his epic weapon, would&#8217;ve been neat to complete 2 epics in the same day.<br><br>We also went on a Hate raid last Friday to explore the second floor and to try to make a run at Inny, unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t get to him before people started logging.  Next time we&#8217;ll probably skip clearing the first floor and go straight to second since there must&#8217;ve been about 150-200 mobs in that floor alone.   Congrats to all armor winners and to <b>Sober</b> for getting his Hand of Maestro.

This is the second time this kind of dispute happened and as usual, no response from Gwidion, guildleader of Havenlight, when asked to settle issues peacefully.
