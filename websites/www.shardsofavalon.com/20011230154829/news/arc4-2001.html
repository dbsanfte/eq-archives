The last run in we had with her resulted in a win to the dragon. Eager to put one up on the scoreboard for us we geared up and let rip.

The rest of the loot (warhammer/Orb of Tishan) went to twinks, so they dont get a mention <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT><br><br>Still eager to lay the smack down we did yet another patented hot-drop in to our favorite Wakening Lands scaley Wuoshi. The high point of this fight being Fuego zoned so slowly he missed the whole thing.  Surprisingly the drops weren't total crap for a change.  We got a bow, crescent blade and 2 shields, as well as 1 scale. Unfortunately at the time I was checking for Severilous in EJ, and only got back in time to find out that Orbin-DK won the emerald scale <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Wingdings">J</FONT><br><br>By now it was getting on but we decided since Kael was only the next zone over we would go and see what we could do about making Derakor the Vindicator's life interesting.  Unfortunately against Derakor we hit a brick wall. After three tries we called it a night, but we learnt alot from him. Our best effort getting him to 40% with all our warriors dead in the first 20 seconds lol. Still we are pretty sure we have it sussed now and will be returning in the very near future to prove our point. Derakor, mark it off on your calendar, your time is due...<br><br>Overall a very busy night, unfotunately a little overshadowed by that giant pain (^ ^) Derekor. But any way you slice it, three dragons in one night is a good effort. I'll see what I can do about getting the drops from Wuoshi posted tomorrow too hehe.<br><br>Stay Safe all, see you in game.  </FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>
