Another guild (Havenlight) had defeated the Overseer of Air in Isle 4 as we rest and recover from our battle with the Eye of Veeshan.  While we were aware that this was happening, we did not realize that the Hand of Veeshan which appears after the Overseer of Air gets killed, would attack us on sight, hence we were caught unprepared and got killed.  We did attempt to fight him again but due to lack of keys and the lateness of the hour, we were unable to do so.
