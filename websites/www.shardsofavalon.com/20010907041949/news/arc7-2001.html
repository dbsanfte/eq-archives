After managing to train ourselves with him near shrooms.. and not being able to stop his gate fast enough... we rebuffed and killed him with 17 people... possibly the worst class make up we've ever had, too. Think it was 1 warrior, 2 rogues and 2 clerics.<br><br>Anyhoo, he dropped a Cobalt Breastplate, which went to <b> Frunkle </b>, who now has a full suit of cobalt. A ranger BP also dropped, which went to someone who i cant remember.... and he dropped 4 teeth for Huyn, Goguk, Some other dude, and one for multiquesting.<br><br>After Trakanon, we had a few more people on, so we headed over to Skyshrine to gank Yelinak. Well, Yelinak has been upgraded yet again, making him more annoying than ever. Managed to get him to 20%, but ran out of steam. He will die again some other time.<br><br>Then many hours later, the servers decided to come down again. Killed Venril Sathir on server up... mostly due to the fact we only had 12 people online.. We dont need 9 groups like some others... but hey, 'whatever works'. (Personal joke)<br><br>Venril had nice drops. He put out a stave to go towards <b> Gradie's </b> epic, a pair of Donals legs which went to <b> Brienaire </b>, who now has a full suit of Donals... and a pair of Elder Spiritists Legs that went to my bank for guildsale. Feel free to tell me with offers. Think we have some other stuff in there.. ES Bp's and BE bp's and the like.<br><br>Well, the VS crew logged off, so 4 of us headed over to WW and layed waste to Myga, to finish the dragonsbane quest for <b> Gradie </b>. Thats about it.</FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

The last accomplishment was earning the right to step into the extremely odd Plane of Mischief knowing we cleared everything along the way.<br><br>First off. To put it bluntly, RIP Jorlleag...NOT!  This big-mama Vox was no easy task but dead on the first try.  It's a shame her drops were Complete Crap!.  She dropped a Facesmasher for our own Fatchu..er Frunkle.  Regents(IS) picked up Blydreln's Bane.  Uhm..grats? hehe.<br><br>Our next kill wasn't so cheap.  Lady Nevedaria was a pain in the ass.  Do you get dizzy turning around and around at seemly warp speed? Plz dont ride the dragon k thnx!~.  The AE got annoying and so did she, hence why we liquidated her sorry twirl-spinning ass.  Drops were nice as well.  Grats to Tiann for getting a nice new Medal of Deep Thought.  Grats also to Durham(IS) for winning the other medal and Pennie(IS) for getting that really nice Girdle of Dark Power.<br><br>After a late night on a weekday, with a server reset (see: patch) we decided the remaining dragons would have to wait to die.  So we packed up, cleared more drakes and clicked on the nice little dollhouse.  WTFG guys, we earned it!<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT.<br>You have entered Plane of Mischief.<br><center><a href="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/jorlleag.jpg"><img src="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/jorlleagTN.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/jorlleagdead.jpg"><img src="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/jorlleagdeadTN.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/ladynev.jpg"><img src="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/ladynevTN.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/ladynevdead.jpg"><img src="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/ladynevdeadTN.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/pom.jpg"><img src="http://www.shardsofavalon.com/news/pomTN.jpg"></a></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

Unique looking guy, too bad it didn't stop him from getting his ass kicked.  As sad as this is, the Vambraces of Discontent went to Lionelies! Congrats!<br>Congrats also to Loric(IS) who won the Boots of the Dead Dream and Draykio(IS) for getting the Thunderstone.<br><br>Next up to die was Dargan the Destroyer who unforunately is a wurm (No Dragonbane!~).  Either way was no matter to us, we still gave him his just deserts.  His drops were 2 Belts of the Destroyer.  Congrats to Aerylin and Zeltar(IS) on both!<br><br>As our hunger grew more for dragon blood, we searched out the FEESH!  That's right, FEESH!  Lord Koi'doken figured he might get the best of us, but of course he went belly up under our lust to clear all of the vermin in North-Wing.  Congrats to Cyrinishad(IS) for the Net of the Deep Sea and another IS member for the Orb of the Deep Sea. I think tass ninja'd it.  I could be wrong though...<br><br>Later into the night, many left and we were stuck pulling those ever nice drakes that killed ranum in about 0.5 seconds.  Bored, we decided that Lady Mirinilla ought to die too.  To our surprise she did! The lady was about as "lady like" as Aedalare, but glad her drops were good.  Congrats to Arbaal for getting a shiny new Frostwrath, as well as Aedalare for getting 1 of the Shawls of Protection.<br><br>The night done, we got some "extras" that included 3 Plate Bracers, a Shield of the Dragonkind for Keggy and a Shield of the Wurm for Zammel.<br><br>Congrats to all the Winners and mostly to accomplishing something for the first time!

We are starting to get this zone sorted now and this trip was a lot smoother than our last outing. We made it as far as Phara Dar, but an unexpected twist saw us lose to him.<br><br>Thanks to a botched pull we started this trip off with Hoshkar in the safe hall, unbuffed, unprepared and with none of the right resist gear on. Quick reactions from everyone (especially our clerics) and some well timed nuking when he tried his inevitable gate saw us standing over one very surprised dragon rather earlier than expected. Grats to <b>Shanodoa</b> on his <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/greysuedeboots.html target=new>Grey Suede boots</a></b>, <b>Melana</b> on her <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/feverblade.html target=new>Feverblade</a></b>, Aydindril (VS) who got a <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/robeofburningrage.html>Robe of Burning Rage</a></b> and to <b>Gradie</b> who looted the <b><a href=http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/fatesealer.html>Fatesealer</a></b>. Also congrats to Frunkle on the green scale - almost there fatty...<br><br>With Hoshkar out of the way Silverwing was just another speed hump. Neero (VS) made off with a <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/lyransmysticallute.html>Lyran's Mystical Lute</a></b> and <b>Emile</b> won the Lifetap Scimitar - cant for the life of me remember what it was called - ill edit this later with the proper name hehe. Enchanter Robe and Shaman Hammer were left to rot. We did a little maintenance for the rest of the evening and then camped out in order to finish up the next day.<br><br>Saturday started out early with a nice easy Xygoz fight. He dropped a <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/staffofnull.html>Staff of Null</a></b> which went to <b>Shandoa</b> and three <b><a href=http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/solistsrobeofinvocation.html>Solist's Robe's of Invocation</a></b> which went to <b>Aedalare</b>, <b>Xandar</b> and <b>Zortek</b>.<br>Next up came Druushk, who despite the pounding he gave us last time had neither help nor the element of surprise and went down smoothly and effortlessly. Two <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/sarnaksummonersstaff.html>Sarnak Summoner Staves</a></b> were left to rot ( I can hear the howls of mages across the globe in my sleep...). <b>Fayde</b> won the <b><a href=http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/skullcrusherofkragg.html>Skull Crusher of Kragg</a></b> and the <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/maelstrom.html>Maelstrom</a></b> went to <b>Frunkle</b>.<br>Nexona we hadnt tried before so we employed a slightly different tactic. While Frunkle was admiring his reflection in his shiney new Lammy look-a-like we pulled in Nexona and let him gorge himself on ogre. Needless to say it was too much ogre for that dragon and when he started to choke we lept in to finish him off. Sadly the ogre could not be rescued. We all must make sacrifices for the greater good.... Grats to Crazdem (VS) on his <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/robeofadversity.html>Robe of Adversity</a></b>, Neero (VS) on his <b><a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/howlingcutlass.html>Howling Cutlass</b></a> and since noone really wanted it <b>Lionelies</b> looted the <b><a href=http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/ykeshanbroadaxe.html>Ykeshan Broad Axe</a></b><br><br>We took a couple shots at Phara, but with only 1 chanter and roboed at that we just didnt have the drain nor the time.
