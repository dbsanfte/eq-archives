Like 30 people in total i think. Well, we got Klown to 25%, but we died. So today we headed back with a decent sized raiding force, and waxed him effortlessly. Loot was some stuff, and the ST key went to Neero (VS).<br><br>Not satisfied, we ran across to ToV and laid waste to Sontalak. He dropped some more stuff, and the ST key went to Warz(IS).<br><br>After this, our numbers dwindled significantly, and no more ST dragons were alive, so we decided to take a trip down memory lane and slay Velketor, just for something to do. Well, we only had one warrior, and our damage output was pitiful, but due to a series of damn fast CHs and rangers tanking, we managed to slay the giant with sober, our only warrior, our only casulty. Loot was pretty crap, but thats a given with Velketor. <b>Flaen</b> picked up a crown, not sure what else happened with the loot. </center></FONT></TD></TR><BR><BR></TABLE>

It took us three attempts to get it right, but nevertheless, Yelinak is now dead. Loot was a Talisman, which went to Draykio(IS), a head for Gauntlets of Dragonslaying, which went to Neero (VS), 2 earrings which went to <b>Aerylin</b> and IS, a Celestial Essence Robe, which went to IS, and a ring, which also went to IS.

We also did some ST raiding with IS on the server up, although we didnt manage to kill the 3rd warder, due to the fact we only had 20 people, we still got a few nice drops.<br><br>Noteable drops include two Windraiders Belt's, Mithril Helm, Orb of the Deep Sea, Nevederia's Horn, and other assorted goodies. The first Vulak dropped a Tolans Longsword of the Glade for Skanda (IS), Vyrinn's Earring of Insanity for <b>Flaen</b> and a now upgraded Palladius' Axe of the Slaughter, for <b>Sober</b>, who is also to be congratulated for breaking 1700 AC barrier today. <br><br>The patch saw a NToV respawn, which was promptly cleared again. Vulak recieved an upgrade, and gave us a bit of trouble at the start of the fight, especially because he came with two drake friends, but we managed to pull through and kill him on our first shot. He dropped his best load to date - A pair of Do'Vassir's Gauntlets of Might for <b>Brienaire</b>, Crystasia's Crystal Ring, which went to Endar (OOK OOK!) if memory serves, and a NICE upgraded Gharn's Rock of Smashing, which was awarded to IS.<br><br>In our epic crusade against the most ferocious of NWing Dragons, Lord Koi`Doken, aka f33sh, we employed a secret tactic. Today, i will share that tactic with you, so you may all bask in the overwhelming glory of f33sh. Use a ranger to tank. Only the ranger super powers can save you against the might of the f33sh. Skanda tanked Koi`Doken for the entire fight and survived.
