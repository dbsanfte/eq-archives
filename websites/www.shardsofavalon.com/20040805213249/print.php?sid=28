<font class="print-normal"><P align=center>Guess I should get back o­n top of things eh?Well we have been playing around a lot in Gates of Discord, and let me tell you it frikin sucks, unless of course you like being hit for over 3,000 damage.  I have not been o­ne rounded in months, until we stumbled into Ikkiniz 4, when the good ole Keeper of the Altar summoned me and pummeled me with tripple 3ks! <STRONG>&lt;OUCH&gt;</STRONG>Anyway, no matter how hard he hits, he hit the ground just that hard too!<IMG alt="" hspace=0 src="http://homepages.wmich.edu/~j2cox/soa/keeperdead.jpg" align=baseline border=0>So since then we have been playing around in Uqua and that place is even worse!Note sorry to say it Exec but I'm glad you're not around for this raid! &lt;Smile Love ya buddy&gt;We have been doing fairly well, progress has been quick, but far from smooth, tempers flare people get upset with each other, but what does that do? Make us work harder to make the other guy appear wrong! &lt;MWAHAHA&gt;  Anyway I've been getting some really horrible screenshots, if someone has some good o­nes feel free to drop them in the picture gallery and Ill make some more updates!Until next time</P>

Hey someone actually reads the inside of these? Wow well nice to meet you, Me? I'm Murtik a lonely wizard in the Shards, it seems my lazy butt guildmates are either not technically adept enough to update the webpage on their own, or just too lazy!!! hahaha I'm just kidding with you guys I love to do this, just wish I was alive at the end of raids to be able to grab some pimp screenshots, instead one of our measly tanks seems to always somewhere inbetween and in that small split second me and goose get summoned and slaughtered during transition!  Anyway I'll quit babbling but I'm still suprised you are reading this if you really are! hahah<br />
