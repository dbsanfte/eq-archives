A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good looking woman, and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.<br>
<br>
Two men applied for the job One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied, she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. <br>
He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching. For weeks he worked, and the ranch was doing very well.<br>
<br>
Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, &quot;You have done a really good job and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels.&quot;<br>
<br>
The hired hand readily agreed and went into town Saturday night. However, one o'clock came and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. He returned around two-thirty and found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace.  She quietly called him over to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Unbutton my blouse and take it off,&quot; she said. Trembling, he did as she directed.<br>
&quot;Now take off my boots.&quot; He did so, slowly.<br>
&quot;Now take off my socks.&quot; He did.<br>
&quot;Now take off my skirt.&quot; He did.<br>
&quot;Now take off my bra.&quot; Again with trembling hands he did as he was told.<br>
<br>
Now,&quot; she said, &quot;take off my panties.&quot;He slowly pulled them down and off.<br>
<br>
Then she looked at him and said, &quot;If you ever wear my clothes to town again, I'll fire you on the spot.&quot;<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
ARGUMENT TERMINOLOGY<br>
<br>
FINE-This is the word women use to end an argument when they feel they are right and you need to shut up. Never use &quot;fine&quot; to describe how a woman looks- this will cause you to have one of those arguments.<br>
<br>
FIVE MINUTES-This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.<br>
<br>
NOTHING-This means &quot;something,&quot; and you should be on your toes.&quot;Nothing&quot; is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. ''Nothing&quot; usually signifies an argument that will last &quot;Five Minutes&quot; and end with 'Fine'<br>
<br>
GO AHEAD (With Raised Eyebrows)- This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over &quot;Nothing&quot; and will end with the word &quot;Fine&quot;<br>
<br>
GO AHEAD (Normal Eyebrows)- This means &quot;I give up&quot; or &quot;do what you want because I don't care&quot; You will get a &quot;Raised Eyebrow Go Ahead&quot; in just a few minutes, followed by &quot;Nothing&quot; and &quot;Fine&quot; and she will talk to you in about &quot;Five Minutes&quot; when she cools off.<br>
<br>
LOUD SIGH - This is not actually a word, but is a nonverbal statement often misunderstood by men. A &quot;Loud Sigh&quot; means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment, and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over &quot;Nothing&quot;<br>
<br>
SOFT SIGH - Again, not a word, but a nonverbal statement. &quot;Soft Sighs&quot; mean that she is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe, and she will stay content.<br>
<br>
THAT'S OKAY - This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man.&quot;That's Okay&quot; means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you back for whatever it is that you have done. &quot;That's Okay&quot; is often used with the word &quot;Fine&quot; and in conjunction with a &quot;Raised Eyebrow GO AHEAD&quot;. At some point in the near future, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.<br>
<br>
PLEASE DO - This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance with the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a &quot;That's Okay&quot;<br>
<br>
THANKS - A woman is thanking you. Do not faint. Just say you're welcome.<br>
<br>
THANKS A LOT - This is much different from &quot;Thanks.&quot; A woman will say, &quot;Thanks A Lot&quot; when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have offended her in some callous way, and will be followed by the &quot;Loud Sigh.&quot; Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the &quot;Loud Sigh,&quot; as she will only tell you &quot;Nothing&quot;<br>
<br>
Send this to the men you know to warn them about future arguments they can avoid if they remember the terminology.<br>

<br>
A 6-year-old and a 4-year-old are upstairs in their bedroom. <br>
<br>
&quot;You know what?&quot; says the 6-year-old. &quot;I think it's about time we start cussing.&quot; The 4-year-old nods his head in approval. <br>
 <br>
The 6-year-old continues. &quot;When we go downstairs for breakfast I'm gonna say &quot;hell&quot; and you say &quot;ass.&quot; &quot;OK!&quot; The 4 year old agrees with enthusiasm. <br>
<br>
Their mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6-year-old what he wants for breakfast. &quot;Aw hell, Mom, I guess I'll have some Cheerios.&quot; <br>
 <br>
WHACK! He flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out, with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear every step. <br>
<br>
The mom locks him in his room &amp; shouts &quot;You can just stay there till I let you out!&quot; She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4-year-old, and asks with a stern voice, &quot;And what do YOU want for breakfast young <br>
man?&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; he blubbers, &quot;But you can bet your fat ass it won't be Cheerios.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.beadchaser.com/graphic/sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
A man walks up to a woman in his office each day, stands very close to<br>
her, draws in a large breath of air and tells her that her hair smells<br>
nice.<br>
<br>
After a week of this, she can 't stand it any longer, and goes to Human<br>
Resources. Without identifying the guy, she tells them what the coworker<br>
does, and that she wants to file a sexual harassment suit against him.<br>
<br>
The HR supervisor is puzzled by this approach, and asks, &quot;What's<br>
sexually threatening about a coworker telling you your hair smells nice?<br>
<br>
The woman replies, &quot;It's Keith, the midget.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
 <br>
<br>
It has been brought to management's attention that some individuals <br>
<br>
throughout the company have been using foul language during the course of <br>
<br>
normal conversation with their coworkers. Due to complaints received from <br>
<br>
some employees who may be easily offended, this type of language will no <br>
<br>
longer be tolerated. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We do however realize the critical importance of being able to accurately <br>
<br>
express your feelings when communicating with coworkers, therefore, a list <br>
<br>
of preferred new phrases has been provided so that proper exchange of ideas <br>
<br>
and information can continue in an effective manner without risk of <br>
<br>
offending our more sensitive employees. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Preferred Phrase <br>
<br>
* Old Phrase <br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>

<br>
* When the fuck do you expect me to do this? <br>
<br>

<br>
I'm certain that is not feasible <br>
<br>
* No fucking way <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Really? <br>
<br>
* You've got to be shitting me <br>
<br>

Perhaps you should check with ... <br>
<br>
* Tell someone who gives a shit <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Of course I'm concerned <br>
<br>
* Ask me if I give a shit <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I wasn't involved in that project <br>
<br>
* Its not my fucking problem <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
That's interesting behavior <br>
<br>
* What the fuck?!?! <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'm not sure I can implement this <br>
<br>
* It won't fucking work <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'll try to schedule that <br>
<br>
* Why the hell didn't you tell me sooner? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Are you sure this is a problem? <br>
<br>
* Who the hell cares? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
He's not familiar with the problem <br>
<br>
* He's got his head up his ass <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Excuse me, sir? <br>
<br>
* Eat shit and die asshole <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
So you weren't happy with it? <br>
<br>
* Kiss my ass <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'm a bit overloaded at this moment <br>
<br>
* Fuck it, I'm on salary <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I don't think you understand <br>
<br>
* Shove it up your ass <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I love a challenge <br>
<br>
* This job sucks <br>
<br>

<br>
* Who the hell died and made you boss? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I see <br>
<br>
* Blow me <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Yes, we really should discuss it <br>
<br>
* Another fucking meeting!?!? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I don't think this will be a problem <br>
<br>
* I really don't give a shit <br>
<br>

<br>
He's somewhat insensitive <br>
<br>

<br>
 <br>
<br>
She's an aggressive go-getter <br>
<br>

<br>
Subject: Onions and Christmas trees<br>
<br>
 A young boy asks his father, &quot;Dad, is it OK for us guys to notice all the different kind of boobs?&quot; <br>
Surprised, the father answers, &quot;Well, sure son, we  wouldn't be normal if we didn't....there are all kinds of breasts...depending on a woman's age-In her twenties, a woman's breasts are like melons, round and firm. In her thirties to forties, they are like pears, still nice but hanging a bit. After fifty, they are like onions.&quot; <br>
&quot;Onions, Dad?&quot; <br>
&quot;Yeah, you see them and they make you cry....&quot; <br>
 <br>
Not to be outdone, his sister asks her mother, &quot;Mom, how many kind of  weenies are there?&quot; The mother, delighted to have equal time, answers, <br>
 &quot;Well, daughter, a man goes through three phases.  In a man's twenties, a man's weenie is like an oak, mighty and hard. In  his thirties and forties, it is like a birch, flexible but reliable. After his fifties, it is like a Christmas tree.&quot; <br>
 &quot;A Christmas tree?&quot; <br>
 &quot;Yep, dried up and the balls are only there for decoration...&quot; <br>

I have...<br>
THINGS YOU'D LOVE TO SAY OUT LOUD AT WORK<br>
<br>
 1. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.<br>
<br>
 2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.<br>
<br>
 3. How about never? Is never good for you?<br>
<br>
 4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.<br>
<br>
 5. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to see it my way.<br>
<br>
 6. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.<br>
<br>
 7. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.<br>
<br>
 8. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.<br>
<br>
 9. It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.<br>
<br>
10. Ahhh...I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again...<br>
<br>
 11. I like you. You remind me of myself when I was young and stupid.<br>
<br>
12. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.<br>
<br>
 13. I have plenty of talent and vision; I just don't give a damn.<br>
<br>
 14. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.<br>
<br>
 15. I will always cherish the initial misconception I had about you.<br>
<br>
16. Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view.<br>
<br>
 17. The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.<br>
<br>
 18. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.<br>
<br>
 19. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?<br>
<br>
 20. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.<br>
<br>
 21. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.<br>
<br>
 22. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial. <br>
<br>
 23. And your crybaby whiny-assed opinion would be...?<br>
<br>
 24. Do I look like a people person?<br>
<br>
 25. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.<br>
<br>
 26. I started out with nothing and still have most of it left.<br>
<br>
 27. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer.<br>
<br>
 28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?<br>
<br>
 29. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed.<br>
<br>
 30. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed.<br>
<br>
 31. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.<br>
<br>
 32. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door.<br>
<br>
 33. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1?<br>
<br>
 34. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.<br>
<br>
 35. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it?<br>
<br>
 36. Chaos, panic, and disorder - my work here is done.<br>
<br>
 37. How do I set a laser printer to stun?<br>
<br>
 38. I thought I wanted a career; turns out I just wanted a salary. <br>

Maybe you had to be there but it had my sister in a fit of laughter.<br>
<br>
I had a family dinner tonight at mother's which included a few cousins, brother and his family, sister and her kids. Most of us are born smart asses, especially me and my siblings.<br>
<br>
I forget how the conversation led to this point but my sister declared to my brother, &quot;I've squirted out just as many kids as you have!&quot;<br>
<br>
My immediate reaction was to clarify that he wasn't the one squirting out the kids. A different thought came to me and, instead, I said, &quot;Yeah, but his squirts didn't hurt nearly as much as yours did!&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
Another story that came up this evening was what my nephew (who's in his teens and he'll never live this down) asked his mom when she was going in for a hysterectomy weeks ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are they going to put a cast on you?&quot;<br>

In the Catholic church were we use to attend, they took Christ of the cross after Easter.<br>
<br>
One sunday my son then about 4 noticed this and took the silence between songs to yell...&quot;There is no Jesus&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Another time he was grilling his mom about where Jesus was.  My wife was trying to explain that he was everywhere....even here.  My son again yelled &quot; Jesus is not here&quot;.  That is why we &quot;use&quot; to attend that church.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub134.ezboard.com/btabularasa19500.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balearic>Balearic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#9999FF,strength=2)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'><font color=#000000><b>Postaholic</span></font></td></tr></TABLE></b></span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#9999FF>(11/6/03 8:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2948.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Here's another joke :-)</span><hr size=1> A farmer had five female pigs and, as times were tough, he had determined to take them to the county fair and sell them. While at the fair he met another farmer who owned five male pigs. After talking a bit, they decided to mate the pigs and split everything 50/50. <br>
<br>
Now, the farmers lived sixty miles away from one another, so they agreed to drive thirty miles and find a field in which to mate their pigs. <br>
<br>
The first morning, the farmer with the female pigs got up at 5:00 AM, loaded the pigs into the family station wagon, which was the only vehicle they had, and drove the thirty miles. <br>
<br>
While the pigs were mating, he asked the other farmer, &quot;How will I know if they are pregnant?&quot; The other farmer replied, &quot;If they're in the grass grazing in the morning, then they're pregnant.....If they're in the mud, then they're not.&quot; <br>
<br>
The next morning they were rolling in the mud, so he hosed them off, called the other farmer, loaded them again into the family station wagon and proceeded to try again. <br>
<br>
The following morning, in the MUD again !! And the next morning, MUD Again !!! This continued all week until the farmer was so tired that he couldn't get out of bed. He called to his wife, &quot; Honey, please look outside and tell me if the pigs are in the mud or in the field grazing.&quot; <br>
<br>
The wife looked out the window and then yelled back, &quot;Neither, they're in the station wagon and one of them is honking the horn.&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=290203">Sir Balearic Pureheart</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
A Priest came along and asked the boy what he had.<br>
 <br>
The boy replied, &quot;This is the most powerful liquid in the world, it's called turpentine.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Priest said, &quot;No, the most powerful liquid in the world is Holy Water. If you take some Holy Water and rub it on a pregnant women's belly, she'll pass a healthy baby.&quot; <br>
<br>
The boy replied, &quot;That ain't nothin'. You take some of this turpentine and rub it on a cat's ass and he'll pass a motorcycle!!!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2948.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2948.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2948.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~honse002/vita/images/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2948.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.threadControl?topicID=2948.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2948.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2948.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://p197.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="tabularasa19500frm1">General Messages<option value="tabularasa19500frm7">Members Only<option value="tabularasa19500frm17">RL Pictures<option value="tabularasa19500frm18">Vita Vault<option value="tabularasa19500frm22">The Hall of Flame!<option value="tabularasa19500frm23">VI Hall of Honor<option value="tabularasa19500frm24">VI Strats<option value="tabularasa19500frm25">Recruit Discussions<option value="tabularasa19500frm33">Raid Analysis<option value="tabularasa19500frm35">Raid Points<option value="tabularasa19500frm36">Screenshots<option value="tabularasa19500frm37">Quests and Spoilers<option value="tabularasa19500frm38">Guild Applications</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#9999FF>- </font><a href=http://p197.ezboard.com/btabularasa19500>Vita Infinita Forum</a><font color=#9999FF> - </font><a href=http://p197.ezboard.com/ftabularasa19500frm1>General Messages</a> <font color=#9999FF> - </font><a href="www.vita-infinita.org">Vita Infinita Home</a><font color=#9999FF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.31m<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
