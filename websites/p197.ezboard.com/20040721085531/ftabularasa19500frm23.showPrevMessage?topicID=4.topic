class=title>   Thanks long overdue...</span><hr size=1> a few weeks back I camped that nasty Ragefire fella in Solb and never got around to thanking the people that made it necessary for me to get my secksi ball and chain. <br>
<br>
It was a relatively easy camp compaired to those that I've heard of..  But remembering it brings mental anguish /erm.. holds himself for a moment.<br>
<br>
the story:<br>
<br>
I logged on (in Solb) to hear the shouts of a Naggy raid leader giving instructions to his raidees.  I manage to walk down to the buff room w/o invis and w/o aggro from anything..  still surprises me to this day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Offer my services to the RL as buffer and rezzer extraordinaire.  He happily accepts.<br>
<br>
an hour later, Naggy is dead and rezzing begins... as does my call in /ooc that Ragefire was b'ing kamped.  I am in the lair all alone for the most part, cept that dorf corpse that was staring back up at me.. my only company <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /hug short fatty corpse.   <br>
<br>
At this time I am sending tells to Dalthus about the spawn times of the Fire Giants and pretty much anything else that I should do and be ready for (I should have paid more attention when I was there with Dalthus for his camp) but we won't go der <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Dalthus happily answers all of my concerns relating to the subject at hand.  He then asks about the approximate spawn time of the Fire Giants..  I tell him about 4:30am pst.  (such a shitty time to spawn lol )  a few minutes later he said that he and a &quot;crew&quot; were to come over at that time and take care of the fatties.<br>
<br>
Thank you to:<br>
<br>
Dalthus<br>
Rorror<br>
Aanas<br>
Ferok<br>
Sujittra<br>
Zzorth<br>
Aminster<br>
Deanan<br>
Zulander - helped with tracking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /high five<br>
Kresham<br>
Roxxy<br>
<br>
for helping me to clear out the Fire Giants.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am thinking.. &quot;phew&quot; one less thing to worry about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   in the meantime I am calling campcheck and people are fighting with me stating that &quot;Ragefire isn't a legitimate camp, itz FFA&quot;  I am well aware of this, but continue to do so.. the person that gave me trouble ironically had a cleric in guild that was going to try for Ragefire. (which is fine and dandy) but..<br>
<br>
so, I asked him the next time &quot;why do you ask for campcheck if you are planning on camping him yourself?&quot; &quot;wouldn't you at that point call Ragefire?&quot; his next question was something that i heard all night, &quot;how long are you going to camp him for?&quot;  my answer: &quot;until I get him&quot;<br>
<br>
enter Dalthus, Aphex, Aanas, Zzorth, Aminster, Sujittra... I am relieved at their arrival, due to the fact that it seemed that the other cleric started getting some peeps in zone.  They put a spanking on the Fire Giants :0)  yay! now only have to worry about the next spawn time.<br>
<br>
Dalthus and gang take off after picking some fights with some of the wussie locals.<br>
<br>
Next spawn time 6.1234556 hours later approx.  This time I am not as lucky, am alone pretty much in zone.. with the exception of Rorror.  I send him a tell (noticing that his lfg tag is on) to see if he wanted to wack some fatty baddies.  He happily accepts.<br>
<br>
he gets down in the lair just in time for a few to pop, and easily eats dem up, until ba ba bum.. we get Magnus to pop, while having the other one still up and bashing.<br>
<br>
I had to evac <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ferok pops up in zone as I pop at the top <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and we then proceed to clear our way back down to the Fire Giants with Rorror in tow.  Keel off the giants.. ba ba bum.. itz all good for another 6.2245123456161345 whatever hours.<br>
<br>
6 hours later a cleric pops in zone that was on the Naggy raid, Reitoc was bound in the buff hall, poor guy went ld and spawned back at a time when the giants are about to spawn. At that point a few popped in the lair, I couldn't do anything really cept take the aggro of the giants and tell him to gate and camp.<br>
<br>
he gated and attempted to camp whilst I was running around with Magnus and friends in the lair while invun trying to buy some time.  He ended up dying and logged onto another character.<br>
<br>
evac again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
this time we try to arrange some sort of mini raid to get down to his corpse, at that point I really didn't care if I got Ragefire.. I was just tired of it all and grumpy.  Reitoc gets Coalition of Power to help out on the mini raid to get his corpse.  I send a tell to a few peeps.. Stryyke responds that he will be able to come along to help.<br>
<br>
I form groups and we enter Solb, we get down to the lcd area when i get a tell: Stryyke tells the group: RAGE is up!!!!! You lucky mother fucker!!&quot;<br>
<br>
You tell your guild: Ragefire is up.<br>
<br>
a number of people called that Rage would spawn as you all were doing Vindi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  hehe, you all were right.<br>
<br>
3 minutes later, 45 Vita's are in zone!! and anon. (what a wonderful feeling.)<br>
<br>
I tell CoP that i'll get the corpse and bring back to zone... I kind of left them high and dry... with hopes that they will understand that I had to take action.  They still wanted to kill the Fire Giants <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I go ld twice, once as Suji was pulling FG's, the second when I was about ready to turn in my Pearl.  talk about drama!<br>
<br>
Finally turn in Pearl and Kill that stinky old dragon.<br>
<br>
hehe, i was like a kid running around unsure as what I should do (Blazir lvl 56 cleric lfg while guild is putting the spankdown on my dragon nemesis)<br>
<br>
A big thank you to Uilaar/Stryyke.  Without your tracking at that time.. who knows what would have happened.<br>
<br>
Thank you to Dalthus for grabbing some of the finest peeps I've had the pleasure of meeting in game to put some whoop ass down on the fatties.  And thanks for the patience, information and support thru the camp.<br>
<br>
Thank you to Catelyn for keeping me awake with silly tells <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Thank you all for coming together in such a quick amount of time... I was and am still most impressed.<br>
<br>
I hope I got everyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /hugs to you all.<br>
<br>
this camp was the most annoying thing that I've ever done in game.  Let us hope that the clerics of future won't have as difficult time as some in the past.  Hopefully they will amend the current quest so that not as many people need to bicker over the &quot;details&quot;<br>
<br>
much luv<br>
