<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">VI members</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Vita Infinita members will not use /anonymous and will fly their Vita Infinita banners AT ALL TIMES. If you need privacy you may use /roleplay.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Twinking</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
VI will have nothing specific to say regarding the act of twinking. However, asking VI members to twink your characters (mains or alts) will not to be tolerated especially over guild chat. If you expect people to give you things than you’re in the wrong guild. Asking to buy something is fine and if a member offers to give you an item then so be it. Member’s generosity should never be put on the spot by being “asked” to give anyone anything.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Powerleveling</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Powerleveling is a tough topic. It is hard to say what is powerleveling and what is merely a little help. Asking a higher level friend in the guild for help through a hell level or to help you ding or anything of that nature will be fine as long as it’s kept out of guild chat. Hardcore powerleveling of characters is not going to be sanctioned by VI in any way. It creates poor players with low skills and poor players don’t benefit VI.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Guild requests for ports</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
If you are in need of a teleport you should try to find a ride by using the following process of elimination. First, is there someone in your group or very close-by that can port you? Second, is there someone in the zone or one zone over that can port you? If you still haven’t found a ride then do a /who all Vita to see what porting capable guildmates might be on. Use your common sense to find members that may not be busy (for instance, someone in WC, EC, DL etc…) and send them a TELL to ask for assistance. Move down the list and ask members by using TELLS. Sending out random requests for help over guild chat should be at a MINIMUM. You should also do your best to be at or near a druid ring or wizzy spire to be picked up. Please do not expect porters to port to your nearest zone and run through 3 zones to give you a ride.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Guild request for rezzes</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
If you are in need of a rez you should try to find a ride by using the following process of elimination. First, is there someone in your group or very close-by that can rez you? Second, is there someone in the zone or one zone over that can rez you? If you still haven’t found a rez then do a /who all Vita to see what cleric guildmates might be on. Use your common sense to find members that may not be busy (for instance, someone in WC, EC, DL etc…) and send them a TELL to ask for assistance. Move down the list and ask members by using TELLS.  Sending out random requests for help over guild chat should be at a MINIMUM. Please try to procure transportation for the cleric ahead of time if needed (see “Guild requests for ports” above).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Message board</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
The message board is for positive communication between guildmates outside of the game. It helps us to organize raids and exchange game information or just to chat about things with our friends. Please use the message board in a respectful, positive manner. Posting messages that are hateful, incite or instigate other members, or are found to be otherwise hurtful to the guild or members MAY be removed by council. Even the touchiest of subjects can be posted in a postive, respectful way. Please use tact and common sense to avoid the ridiculous scenario of council having to sensor posts...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Guild chat</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Guild chat is where we all as a family can communicate and have fun regardless of what we may be doing or how far away we are from each other. Guild chat is NOT the place to iron out differences, be overly vulgar or rude, argue, use inflammatory language, or instigate your guildmates. This behavior is not acceptable and  will not be tolerated. USING THE /GUILD CHANNEL IN THIS MANNER CAN RESULT IN DE-GUILDING!<br>
<br>
Even if you have something personal to discuss with someone that is not negative, please do this in tells to cut down on the enormous amount of green spam that goes by. Ask yourself, does anyone other than who I am directing this to care about what I am saying? If the answer is no, take it to tells, please.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Inner-guild disputes</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Disputes between guildmates should at least be attempted to be resolved between the parties involved. This is a game so hopefully people can resolve their differences in this manner. If after attempting to resolve the conflict you are still at an impasse, the matter needs to be brought to the council for our intervention. All interested parties should send their “version” of the conflict to <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: eqballzz@yahoo.com">  eqballzz@yahoo.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--> for our review. If you choose this option be warned that whatever is resolved by council may not be agreeable to either party but the council ruling on the matter will be final. AT NO TIME WILL INNER-GUILD DISPUTES BE HASHED OUT OVER GUILD CHAT. DOING THIS CAN RESULT IN DE-GUILDING. Please note that putting a guildmate on the /ignore list is not acceptable in Vita Infinita. If you are at that point you must follow the steps above to reach some sort of resolution. Please do not IGNORE your guildmates!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"> Disputes that involve non-guildmates</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Disputes between guildmates and non-guildmates should at least be attempted to be resolved between the parties involved. This is a game so hopefully people can resolve their differences in this manner. If after attempting to resolve the conflict you are still at an impasse, the matter needs to be brought to the council for our intervention. All interested parties should send their “version” of the conflict to <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: eqballzz@yahoo.com">  eqballzz@yahoo.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--> for our review. If the non-guildmate is part of a guild then contact information for their guild should be provided such as council members or guildleader name. The council will discuss the matter and look to either the non-guildmate or the non-guildmates guild contact or both to resolve the matter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Complaints about VI members (from non-guildmates)</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Anyone with a complaint about one of our members should speak with a council member or send a detailed account of the problem to <!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto: eqballzz@yahoo.com">  eqballzz@yahoo.com</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--> for us to review. If you are truly looking for a resolution to a conflict please do not post on the general message boards as this will only result in flames.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"> Deguilding</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
In the past VI has been lenient on allowing people to return after multiple deguildings but due to the serioius disruption this causes we are instituting a new policy and will enforce it.<br>
<br>
Deguild once and want to return? You can only be re-guilded by a council member who at that time will discuss the VI policy as well as the circumstances under which you left. If you didn't leave the guild in a bad way the council member *may* re-invite you or discuss the decision with council first if he thinks it necessary. This does not apply to people that were removed from the guild for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
Deguild a second time and want to return? This will be very difficult but due to the rare extenuating circumstance that *might* arise there will be the opportunity to get a unanimous council decision on a second chance. I can promise you that this will not be easy.<br>
<br>
There will be no third chances.<br>
<br>
My only advice is that you think through your actions (and consequences) *prior* to acting on them. It is not right to put the guild in turmoil so we ask that you not make big decisions like deguilding when your upset/ emotional/ drunk etc...If you don't want to be in the guild then that's fine but make sure that's what you want. Conversely, if you decide that you made a mistake and want to come back make sure you plan on staying.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">*Special Note on Deguilding and RPP*</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Anyone that deguilds their character and has positive RPP will have their RPP reset to zero if they should return. Any member with negative RPP will remain negative.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">*Special note on &quot;temporary&quot; deguilding*</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
It has been discussed in council and decided that we will no longer allow our members to deguild for the purpose of raiding with other guilds. The guilds that require that type of action are not in need of people to make their raids successful. It is our opinion that this is done primarily to lure new people into their guild. While we have no problem with our members raiding with other guilds we will no longer allow people to &quot;deguild&quot; just to raid with another guild. If you do decide to do this it will count as a normal &quot;deguilding&quot; (see above). If you have any questions about this please talk to a council member.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Loot rules on VI raids</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
At this time Vita uses the Vita Loot System (VLS) which is explained at length in the RPP section for members only.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  Epic Weapons and Trak Teeth</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
These items will be defaulted to the person that is farthest along in the respective quests. If there is a tie, it will be rolled between them using the WRS. Items will NOT be defaulted to people on raids UNLESS they have scheduled a raid for themselves on an Epic Tuesday OR they haved camped the mob (ie. Sev/Rage) for a reasonable amount of time (meaning they didn't happen to see the mob up or camped it for a very limited time). To be considered for the default under the &quot;camping&quot; exception you MUST be on that piece in your epic or it will be rolled farthest along! <br>
<br>
&quot;Camping&quot; is defined as having the character that needs the item IN THE ZONE the whole time, waiting for the mob to spawn. This does NOT mean logging on an alt every so often to check on a spawn. Members that are actively camping one of these rare spawns are required to communicate with the guild AND the alliance REGULARLY in the appropriate chat channels so there is no question or confusion about who is camping or who will be getting the item should the mob spawn. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Special info on Loot</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Extra Loot</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
For details on loot system see RPP thread. Droppable items that are not wanted at raids are banked and sold for guild fund or available for RPP purchase at 1/2 RPP. No drop items not purchased with RPP will rot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note On Special Circumstances</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
There may be certain circumstances that come up regarding loot where a Vita Raid Leader (special officer appointed by Council) *may* see fit to deviate from what would be considered *normal* loot procedure. If this happens, please trust that decisions of this nature are made with the GUILD in mind and are sometimes not easy choices to make. What the leadership asks of you at this point is to *TRUST* that the leaders have the guild's good at heart and to try and be supportive rather than combative. Does this make everyone exempt from making mistakes? No. But that does NOT mean it is ok to throw a fit/flame in guildchat or otherwise make a scene (please see guild policy on &quot;Inner-guid disputes&quot; and &quot;Guild chat&quot;). Outbursts in guildchat over loot will not be tolerated. PERIOD.<br>
<br>
If a &quot;special&quot; circumstance comes up it will be explained to the guild/raid and/or people involved (ie. if it only applies to a certain class in attendance...they will be talked to) at the time of the event (not later on) so as to not cause confusion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  WARNING</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
If any item that drops on a raid becomes so hotly contested in guildchat FOR WHATEVER REASON, the raid leaders *MAY* decide to destroy the item in question to end the discussion once and for all. MW employs this system as a deterant to endless arguments over loot and even though we don't feel this is going to be necessary in VI the option is there and *may* be used by the raid leader as a last resort. No item in the game is worth the anger/frustration/bitterness/hassle so we won't allow that to happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  Alternate Character Policy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Introduction</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
It is natural that people may want to play alternate characters from time to time and for various reasons. These may include boredom, desire to be with other friends or relatives, nostalgia for former guilds, etc. Still, alternate characters pose certain problems for the guild where the person's main character resides. While no policy is a catch all, this policy is designed to minimize these problems. Problems not addressed here will be dealt with by the Vita Infinita council as necessary.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Applicants and Alternates</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
When a person applies to Vita Infinita for membership, it is assumed that the main character being put forth for membership will be the character that will, for the most part (see below) be played in the guild. After all, that is why there are level and class requirements for application to Vita. <br>
<br>
Applicants with alternates who do not meet the minimum guild requirements may ask that alternates be guilded, but said alternates may not become that person's &quot;main&quot; character without special dispensation of the council. Guilded alternates will be subject to all other alternate/main requirements as listed below or in other Vita Infinita Policies.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Raids, Loot, and Alternates</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
Raid leaders have all say regarding the attendance of alternates and the distribution of loot during their raid. In lieu of stated policy by said raid leaders, Vita members will bring the character to the raid that is most needed for the raid as required by the raid leader. Where an alternate character is requested/required, that character will be considered as a 'main' character with regards to loot. However, should the player desire to roll on items for their main character, they will be allowed to do so (within the established raid-loot rules). Other level/race/epic restrictions may apply as determined by the raid leaders. <br>
<br>
NOTE: When players are requested to bring an alternate in lieu of a main, the person may declare which character they are rolling on loot for. This MUST be done BEFORE the raid begins directly to the raid leader! (IN OTHER WORDS, you may not wait to see if your uber item dropped for one character before declaring intention to roll for it.)<br>
<br>
In cases where the main or alternate character is not prefered by the raid leader, members are free to bring which ever character they desire, so long as the raid requirements are met, whatever they may be. Alts will NOT roll against mains for loot unless they meet the above requirement or there is a special case (which will be solely up to the raid leader to determine). Raid leaders will have final say with regards to loot distributions, rolls, etc.<br>
<br>
Please see the RPP thread for other info on alts and 2 box mains.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Alternates In Other Guilds</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
Alternates in other guilds are permitted so long as this does not create a conflict of interest for Vita Infinita. A conflict of interest generally occurs when the alternate is of comparable level and raids items that main level Vita Infinita members are raiding. For this reason, no Vita Infinita member will have alternates in other guilds that raid at levels 50 plus.<br>
<br>
Other conflicts of interest will be dealt with on a case by case basis and this policy altered as required. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Switching 'Main' Characters</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
Situations may occur where the individual may request that a person's alternate character become the main character. This must be brought to council for discussion to be considered. Wherever possible, the council will grant this request given that the alternate meets level and class requirements. Where these requirements are not met, special dispensation will be considered by the council on a case by case basis.<br>
<br>
In the event that this wish is granted the new main will be treated as a main and their former main will become their alt. Due to the possible impact this can have on the guild it *may* be requested (by council or raid leaders) that your alt be brought to particular raids if it means the success of the raid is at stake. This is expected and should not be a problem since we are all here for the success of the guild as opposed to individual characters. Main/alt loot rules will pertain to this new main/alt as stated above in &quot;Raids, Loot, and Alternates&quot;. <br>
<br>
If the choice is given, players MUST DECLARE WHICH CHARACTER THEY ARE ROLLING FOR TO THE RAID LEADER BEFORE THE RAID BEGINS. If this is NOT done, roll defaults to the character attending the raid.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Only switch your main characters if you are very very sure. The council will take a dim view of members who seem to change main characters whimsically or for profit and may forbid further switching while remaining guilded.<br>
<br>
Final Note:<br>
<br>
These rules are designed to minimize misunderstanding while maximizing the benefit to the individual and the guild as a whole. Circumstances not addressed by this policy will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and this policy will be altered accordingly. Hint: In most cases, a little common sense will go a long way. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>            NOTE:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The Council MAY alter these polices or include additional policies as it sees fit, so remember to check back here every so often to see if things have changed (will usually notify guild of any changes) or if you are unclear of anything. If any of these policies are not clear to you get with a council member.<br>
