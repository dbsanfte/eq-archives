class=m><span class=title>   to my friends and EQ family</span><hr size=1> This posting is being written to show my thanks and appreciation for all the friends that over the last few days (and countless others) who basically hung out with me in SolB to help complete my epic weapon quest.  Many weren't there the whole time, but they many were there an obscene length in some instances and it was a good feeling to know that out of the woodwork i could see people cruising into Naggy's Lair for me.  I'm not gonna be putting anyone's name here in any particular order, because without all of you, this wouldn't have been a success in my eyes.  I started out Saturday morning Dec 22 waiting for the scheduled Naggy raid to be completed.  They started around noon'ish so i figured i would be chill'in in is Lair around 3pm or so.  Well low and behold...Marton and Morgin are playin around there in SolB.  I'm sure partly because they knew i was planning on starting my Rage camp that day, but also to get xp.  When the Naggy raid finally cleared out the fire giants, Marton rolled his big bear ass (of course no pun intended..hehe)down there and between the both of us we buffed the raid to the best of our abilities.  I can only imagine what kind of impact 60shammy buffs have on an average lvl 50 melee's effectiveness.  With that being said, they moved in and killed Naggy with only 4deaths  hehe, was overkill anyway, but who cares.  Naggy dropped crap for loot, no pally book or red scale.  Well after the raid was over with, many of my good friends started popping in to hang out with me there in the lair.  Marton and Morgin had to log for a bit, but assured me they'd be back later to help clear out the giants.  By this time, it was around 4pm or so and Sujittra showed up with her assling and Maeven also.  Zzorth popped in and brought Iluivadr and ol' Hurm showed up also.  well, we were pretty bored just sitting in there, so we decided to get some xp from the LDC's etc there close by.  (don't worry, this is gonna be long and drawn out) well i realy kind of lost track of time, but before i knew it Neesha Uthal Ariadnei Uhgree ZiggyBoz Blazir Seliel and Dolalin had popped by to see what was goin on and lend their moral support.  well guys all i gotta say is first off, you turned one hell of a boring camp into boat loads of fun.   /rude Morgin for marathon pulling damn near that entire zone.  i still think you lost your mind there for a little while  hehe.  when camp check was called we pretty much had efreei / ldc / bnb / and god knows what else called.   /rude Blazir for beatin me to the camp check call so many times  hehe.  Aanas popped in and brought his wife Nosylla there also, Nosy camped out in Naggy's lair to await my call when Rage finally did pop so that she might lend her hand.  Aanas on the other hand was a big help to me by transfering tons of loot etc to a mule there in EC so that i could go from being  240/150 back down to a reasonable weight.  i never split any of that loot cause all you guys were coming and goin like it was cool all night and damn day.  so the guild bank is gonna get some descent items i think and a little pp.  i'd like to say thanks to Aanas again though, cause he would pop in MANY times and run over just to swap out gold for pp or even sell all the useless junk i'd picked up and then sell that for me as well.  Lotwell and Kirya showed up sometime Saturday after noon, and i had them CoH'd back into the lair where they camped out to await my call shouting &quot;RAGE IS UP&quot; into their ear over the phone.  well to get back to my time line of events here... later that night on Saturday, around 9pm to be exact (est.) out of the wood work again, show about 15 of my Vita's there in SolB to clear out the FG's.  i swear not 20min before the giants were to pop there were only 6 of us in the zone.... where the hell you all came from is beyond me  /bow...soooo the fg's get cleared once more, and they aren't scheduled to be back up untill around 3am or so my time (est.)  i still have Zzorth hanging strong, and a few more people have popped in. Hurm had to go to bed cause he's old, but Uthal showed up to take his spot and once again we set ourselves against the fg's.  morgin is with my group now, and Marton has a gang of his own.  so  its lookin like we might have to fight for the xp on these bad boys now.  yes and the two groups clear em like orc1 in EC with a little friendly competition for the xp which seemed to be split 50/50 with both groups  /rude Martons group ! hehe..  now its late of course, but low and behold! several of you that were camped out in the lair start showin up! omfg Hurm is there and so is drunken Sujittra  hehe, but ya showed up a little late and missed the fun with the giants  hehe.  but just poppin up at 4am to help clear em out is damn impressive in my eyes /hugs guys.  well, after the giants were cleared that time Dolalin Zzorth Sujittra Blazir Ziggyboz and Uhgree...and i'm gonna kick myself if i missed someone there  : \    but we went and killed some more spiders before deciding that around 5am that i oughta get a nap or somethin....tears guys..Dolalin and Blazir just sat there in the lair for 2.5hrs in the early morning while myself and Zzorth got a short nap.  so in the spirit of camping a mob, i brought my blanket and pillow downstairs here and fall asleep on the floor beside my computer desk with the alarm close to wake me around 8am, about an hour before the giants would once again need killing.  i get up and low and behold, Blazir and Dolalin are still keeping the vigil there in the lair awaiting my return and anyone else that might show up there.  well i do a /who all Vita... and not to many of ya were online, but the few that were sure as hell ran straight for SolB to help me clear em out once again.  Uhgree and Ziggyboz must have already been on the way there, cause when i asked to come, i think it might have been 2min later before i had them CoH'd back to us in the lair.  so here we get to the morning on Sunday.  its around 10am and Suji finally gets up after sleepin off her hangover  hehe, and we decide that we must get XP!!  so she has Sujittra FD in front of where Rage will spawn and Me Maeven, Dolalin, Blazir, Ziggyboz and Uhgree start camping damn near the entire zone!  when camp check was called.. /rude Blazir had a hot key up and beat me most every time to answer the camp check with...  /ooc rage / freeit / ldc this is a hot key, hahahah beat you Dalthus!  grrrrr    so we pretty much ran from camp to camp when we killed all the mobs in each one.  its gettin on to around 2 or 3 pm and more Vitas are trickling in to the dungeon or back on-line after a good nights sleep!  i felt so good yet bad at times cause so many of you would ask me if there was room in our group, but we were filled up with so many die hards it seems that i couldn't find room in my group for all.. thanks guys for wanting to come over and hang out.  so its around 3pm (est.) and the giants are scheduled to pop around 5pm, and omfg Lotwell just logs in to see what goin on and to ask how i was doin, and RAGE is instantly being shouted throughout guild chat!!!  so the plan was pretty simple Maeven was there in the Lair and i was bound just outside.  so our group ran straight from Efreeti's camp back to the lair and i gated out so that we could begin the CoH of everyone that was able to come and help.  i called as many people on my list to have them log on...and omg was that list long and i want to apologize to all that i tried to call but couldn't reach, it means a lot that you wanted to help so much that i was given your phone number to call when he did pop.  i swear not 15min after Lotwell made that announcement, there were friggin 30 Vita's in zone and Sujittra had already made up the groups and maybe 15min after that we were ready to turn in my shimmering pearl!!!  we may have had tremendous overkill, but i don't care one bit.  My friends were there to help me take on my final epic mob, and honestly i couldn't ask for more. and now a small tribute, be patient:<br>
Suji..my best EQ friend i need say no more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /hugs<br>

Your &quot;note&quot; illustrates the true strength of this game we play.  It's not the loot, the epics, or anything else.  It is the people that we meet and the good times we have.  Those are the things that matter and anyone who reads your post would have to agree that Vita has these types of people in abundance.  I was glad and honored to have been there to help you with your epic.  <br>
<br>
One other thing.  The achievement of an epic is no small thing.  Although many are necessary to have it happen, it still requires a tremendous amount of work and dedication and commitment from you.  I remember when I posted on the Ranger's Glade when I finished my epics, one fellow Ranger said it best<br>
