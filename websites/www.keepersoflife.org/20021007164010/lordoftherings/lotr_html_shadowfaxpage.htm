      (Gandalf) wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak, and led
      the way.&nbsp; Following him they descended quickly from the high
      shelf and made their way back through the forest, down the
      bank of the Entwash.&nbsp; They spoke no more words, until they
      stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of Fangorn.&nbsp;
      There was no sign of their horses to be seen.

      'They have not returned,' said Legolas.&nbsp; 'It will be a
      weary walk!' <BR><BR>

      'I shall not walk.&nbsp; Time presses,' said Gandalf.&nbsp; Then
      lifting up his head he gave a long whistle.&nbsp; So clear and
      piercing was the note that the others stood amazed to hear such a
      sound come from those old bearded lips.&nbsp; Three times he
      whistled;&nbsp; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that
      they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the
      eastern wind.&nbsp; They waited wondering.&nbsp; Before long there
      came the sound of hoofs, at first hardly more than a tremor of the
      ground perceptible only to Aragorn as he lay upon the grass, then
      growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat. <BR>&nbsp;

      'There is more than one horse coming,' said Aragorn. <BR><BR>

      'Certainly,' said Gandalf.&nbsp; 'We are too great a burden for
       one.' <BR><BR>

      'There are three,' said Legolas, gazing out over the plain.&nbsp;
      'See how they run?&nbsp; There is Hasufel, and there is my friend
      Arod beside him!&nbsp; But there is another that strides ahead:&nbsp;
      a very great horse.&nbsp; I have not seen his like before.' <BR><BR>

      'Nor will you again,' said Gandalf.&nbsp; 'That is Shadowfax.&nbsp;
      He is the chief of the Mearas, lords of horses, and not even
      Theoden, King of Rohan, has ever looked on a better.&nbsp; Does
      he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly as a swift stream?&nbsp;
      He has come for me:&nbsp; the horse of the White Rider.&nbsp; We are
      going to battle together.' <BR><BR>

      Even as the old wizard spoke, the great horse came striding
      up the slope towards them;&nbsp; his coat was glistening and his
      mane flowing in the wind of his speed.&nbsp; The two others
      followed, now far behind.&nbsp; As soon as Shadowfax saw Gandalf,
      he checked his pace and whinnied loudly;&nbsp; then trotting gently
      forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils
      against the old man's neck. <BR><BR>

      Gandalf caressed him.&nbsp; 'It is a long way from Rivendell, my
      friend,' he said;&nbsp; 'but you are wise and swift and come at
      need.&nbsp; Far let us ride now together, and part not in this
      world again!'

      Soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting
      orders.&nbsp; 'We go at once to Meduseld, the hall of your master,
      Th&eacute;oden,' said Gandalf, addressing them gravely.&nbsp; They
      bowed their heads.&nbsp; 'Time presses, so with your leave, my
      friends, we will ride.&nbsp; We beg you to use all the speed that
      you can.&nbsp; Hasufel shall bear Aragorn and Arod Legolas.&nbsp;
      I will set Gimli before me, and by his leave Shadowfax shall
      bear us both.&nbsp; We will wait now only to drink a little.' <BR><BR>

      'Now I understand a part of last night's riddle,' said Legolas
      as he sprang lightly upon Arod's back.&nbsp; 'Whether they
      fled at first in fear, or not, our horses met Shadowfax, their
      chieftain, and greeted him with joy.&nbsp; Did you know that he
      was at hand, Gandalf?' <BR><BR>

      'Yes, I knew,' said the wizard.&nbsp; 'I bent my thought upon
      him, bidding him to make haste;&nbsp; for yesterday he was far
      away in the south of this land.&nbsp; Swiftly may he bear me
      back again!' <BR>&nbsp;

      Gandalf spoke now to Shadowfax, and the horse set off at a good
      pace, yet not beyond the measure of the others.&nbsp; After
      a little while he turned suddenly, and choosing a place where
      the banks were lower, he waded the river, and then led them
      away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide.&nbsp;
      The wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of
      grass.&nbsp; There was no sign of road or track, but Shadowfax
      did not stay or falter. <BR><BR>

      'He is steering a straight course now for the halls of
      Th&eacute;oden under the slopes of the White Mountains,'
      said Gandalf.&nbsp; 'It will be quicker so.&nbsp; The
      ground is firmer in the Eastemnet, where the chief northward
      track lies, across the river, but Shadowfax knows the
      way through every fen and hollow.' <BR><BR>

      For many hours they rode on through the meads and
      riverlands.&nbsp; Often the grass was so high that it
      reached above the knees of the riders, and their steeds
      seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea.&nbsp; They came
      upon many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving
      above wet and treacherous bogs;&nbsp; but Shadowfax found
      the way, and the other horses followed in his swath.&nbsp;
      Slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the West.&nbsp;
      Looking out over the great plain, far away the riders saw
      it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass.&nbsp;
      Low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains
      glinted red upon either side.&nbsp; A smoke seemed to rise
      up and darken the sun's disc to the hue of blood, as if it
      had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of
      earth. <BR>&nbsp;

      'There lies the Gap of Rohan,' said Gandalf.&nbsp; 'It is now
      almost due west of us.&nbsp; That way lies Isengard.' <BR><BR>

      'I see a great smoke,' said Legolas.&nbsp; 'What may that
      be?' <BR><BR>

      'Battle and war!' said Gandalf.&nbsp; 'Ride on!'
