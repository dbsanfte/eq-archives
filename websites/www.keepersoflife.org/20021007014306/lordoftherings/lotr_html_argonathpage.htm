      ... Slowly the sky above grew lighter, and then suddenly the
      clouds broke, and their draggled fringes trailed away northward
      up the River.  The fogs and mists were gone.  Before the
      travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which
      clung, upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees.
      The channel grew narrower and the River swifter.  Now they were
      speeding along with litle hope of stopping or turning, whatever
      they might meet ahead.  Over them was a lane of pale-blue sky,
      around them the dark overshadowed River, and before them, black,
      shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no opening
      could be seen. <BR><BR><BR>

      Frodo, peering forward, saw in the distance two great rocks
      approaching:  like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they
      seemed.  Tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side
      of the stream.  A narrow gap appeared between them, and the River
      swept the boats towards it. <BR><BR><BR>

      "Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings!" cried Aragorn.
      "We shall pass them soon.  Keep the boats in line, and as far
      apart as you can!  Hold the middle of the stream!"

      As Frodo was borne towards them, the great pillars rose like
      towers to meet him.  Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures
      silent but threatening.  Then he saw that they were indeed shaped
      and fashioned:  the craft and power of old had wrought upon them,
      and still they preserved, through the suns and rains of forgotten
      years, the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn.  Upon
      great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings
      of stone:  still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they
      frowned upon the North.  The left hand of each was raised palm
      outwards in gesture of warning;  in each right hand there was an
      axe;  upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown.  Great
      power and majesty they still wore, the silent wardens of a
      long-vanished kingdom.  Awe and fear fell upon Frodo, and he
      cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the
      boat drew near.  Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled
      by, frail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring
      shadow of the sentinels of N&uacute;menor.  So they passed into
      the dark chasm of the Gates.

      Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either
      side.  Far off was the dim sky.  The black waters roared and
      echoed, and a wind screamed over them.  Frodo, crouching over his
      knees, heard Sam in front muttering and groaning:  "What a place!
      What a horrible place!  Just let me get out of this boat, and 
      I'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river!" <BR><BR>

      "Fear not!" said a strange voice behind him.  Frodo turned and
      saw Strider, and yet not Strider;  for the weatherworn Ranger
      was no longer there.  In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn,
      proud and erect, guiding the boat with skilful strokes;  his
      hood was cast back, and his dark hair was blowing in the wind,
      a light was in his eyes:  a king returning from exile to his own
      land. <BR><BR>

      "Fear not!" he said.  "Long have I desired to look upon the
      likenesses of Isildur and An&aacute;rion, my sires of old.
      Under their shadow, Elessar, the Elfstone, son of Arathorn of
      the House of Valandil, Isildur's son, heir of Elendil, has
      nought to dread!" <BR><BR>
