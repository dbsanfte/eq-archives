      "Look ahead!" called Gandalf.  "The Bridge is near.  It is
      dangerous and narrow." <BR><BR>

      Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm.  At the end of the
      hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth.  The outer
      door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone, without
      kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of
      fifty feet. <BR><BR>

      It was an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that
      might capture the First Hall and the outer passages.  They could
      only pass across it in single file.  At the brink Gandalf halted
      and the others came up in a pack behind. <BR>

      "Lead the way, Gimli!" he said.  "Pippin and Merry next.
      Straight on, and up the stair beyond the door!"

      Arrows fell among them.  One struck Frodo and sprang back.
      Another pierced Gandalf's hat and stuck there like a black
      feather.  Frodo looked behind.  Beyond the fire he saw swarming
      black figures;  there seemed to be hundreds of orcs.  They
      brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in
      the firelight.  <I>Doom, doom</I> rolled the drumbeats, growing
      louder and louder, <I>doom, doom</I>. <BR><BR>

      Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string,
      though it was a long shot for his small bow.  He drew
      but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground.  He gave
      a cry of dismay and fear.  Two great trolls appeared;  they bore
      great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways
      over the fire.  But it was not the trolls that had filled the
      elf with terror.  The ranks of the orcs had opened and they
      crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid.  Something was
      coming up behind them.  What it was could not be seen;  it was
      like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of
      man-shape maybe, yet greater;  and a power and a terror seemed
      to be in it and to go before it. <BR><BR>

      It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a
      cloud had bent over it.  Then with a rush it leaped across the
      fissure.  The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about
      it; and a black smoke swirled in the air.  Its streaming mane
      kindled, and blazed behind it.  In its right hand was a blade
      like a stabbing tongue of fire;  in its left it held a whip of
      many thongs. <BR><BR>

      "Ai! ai!" wailed Legolas.  "A Balrog!  A Balrog is come!" <BR><BR>

      Gimli stared with wide eyes.  "Durin's Bane!" he cried, and,
      letting his axe fall, he covered his face. <BR><BR>

      "A Balrog," muttered Gandalf. "Now I understand."  He faltered
      and leaned heavily on his staff.  "What an evil fortune!  And I
      am already weary." <BR><BR>

      The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them.  The
      orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways.  Then Boromir
      raised his horn and blew.  Loud the challenge rang and bellowed,
      like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof.  For a
      moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted.  Then the
      echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind, and
      the enemy advanced again. <BR><BR>

      "Over the bridge!" cried Gandalf, recalling his strength.  "Fly!
      This is a foe beyond any of you.  I must hold the narrow way.
      Fly!"  Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command, but still
      held their ground, side by side, behind Gandalf at the far end
      of the bridge.  The others halted just within the doorway at the
      hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to face the
      enemy alone.

      The Balrog reached the bridge.  Gandalf stood in the middle of
      the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other
      hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white.  His enemy halted again,
      facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast
      wings.  It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked.
      Fire came from its nostrils.  But Gandalf stood firm. <BR><BR>

      "You cannot pass," he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead
      silence fell.  "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of
      the flame of Anor.  You cannot pass.  The dark fire will not
      avail you, flame of Ud&ucirc;n.  Go back to the Shadow!  You
      cannot pass." <BR><BR>

      The Balrog made no answer.  The fire in it seemed to die, but
      the darkness grew.  It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge,
      and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings
      were spread from wall to wall;  but still Gandalf could be seen,
      glimmering in the gloom;  he seemed small, and altogether alone;
      grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm. <BR><BR>

      From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. <BR><BR>

      Glamdring glittered white in answer. <BR><BR>

      There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire.  The Balrog
      fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments.  The wizard
      swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood
      still.

      "You cannot pass!" he said. <BR><BR>

      With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge.  Its whip
      whirled and hissed. <BR><BR>

      "He cannot stand alone!" cried Aragorn suddenly and he ran back
      along the bridge. "Elendil!" he shouted.  "I am with you,
      Gandalf!" <BR><BR>

      "Gondor!" cried Boromir and leaped after him. <BR><BR>

      At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and, crying aloud, he
      smote the bridge before him.  The staff broke asunder and fell
      from his hand.  A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up.  The
      bridge cracked.  Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the
      stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest
      remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out
      into emptiness.

      With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow
      plunged down and vanished.  But even as it fell it swung its
      whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees,
      dragging him to the brink.  He staggered, and fell, grasped
      vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss.  "Fly, you fools!"
      he cried, and was gone.
