      Then suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: &nbsp;a
      change. &nbsp;Wind was in his face! &nbsp;Light was
      glimmering. &nbsp;Far, far away, in the South the clouds
      could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up,
      drifting: &nbsp;morning lay beyond them.<BR><BR>

      But at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning
      had sprung from the earth beneath the City. &nbsp;For a searing
      second it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its
      topmost tower like a glittering needle; &nbsp;and then as the
      darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields
      a great <I>boom</I>.<BR><BR>

      At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly
      erect. &nbsp;Tall and proud he seemed again; &nbsp;and rising in his
      his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there
      had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:<BR><BR>

      <I>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arise, arise, Riders of Th&eacute;oden!<BR>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fell deeds awake: &nbsp;fire and slaughter!<BR>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,<BR>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!<BR>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ride now, ride now! &nbsp;Ride to Gondor!<BR><BR>

      With that he seized a great horn from Guthl&aacute;f
      his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that
      it burst asunder. &nbsp;And straightaway all the horns in the
      host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns
      of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and
      a thunder in the mountains.<BR><BR>

      Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang
      away. &nbsp;Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse
      upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. &nbsp;After him
      thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before
      them. &nbsp;&Eacute;omer rode there, the white horsetail on
      his helm floating in this speed, and the front of the first
      &eacute;ored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore,
      but Th&eacute;oden could not be overtaken. &nbsp;Fey he
      seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire
      in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of
      old, even as Orom&euml; the Great in the battle of the Valar
      when the world was young. &nbsp;His golden shield was uncovered,
      and lo! &nbsp;it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass
      flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. &nbsp;For
      morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; &nbsp;and
      darkness was removed, and the host of Mordor wailed, and
      terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of
      wrath rode over them. &nbsp;And then all the host of Rohan
      burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of
      battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that
      was fair and terrible came even to the City.
