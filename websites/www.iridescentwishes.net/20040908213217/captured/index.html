Been awhile. Everything checks out to be fine. So no navigation or layout problems, thank God! Now going back to my writings, I added one new piece. I just wrote it early morning, so please excuse all the grammatical errors or lack of logical movement in the prose. The link to Home Sweet Home, can be found at the bottom of the menu list, it also has a "new" announcement next to it. I also went back and added in the description that were missing in the poetry section. Revised Lady Night too. Other than that, I'm trying to complete a few other pieces.<br>

Fixed all (I believe) the links, navigation and etc. Site is up and running. Thank God. I spent two days remaking some of the files and having to change each page to fit the small changes in the layout. Aargh! But now that it's done, I'm TTTTTHHHHHIIIISSSSS happy! Other than editing my works, I'm going to have to start burning some cds for Tara. Just a heads up, this site might contain some works by my friend Christina in the near (or far) future. =)<br>

It's been a while since I worked on this layout. I gave up on PHP and then had to recode all the files back to HTML. So here's the new layout that should have been up on the net on July.  Still working on "The Gift." It's hard - I like the idea but the piece is emotionless. Maybe I'll try to work on the beginning of the collaboration with Christina. Don't know.<br>

Stayed up into the wee hours of this morning. HTML everything, now I have to go through each file and make sure there aren't any errors. <s>After that I'm going to PHP everything. At least the new layout is almost done!</s> I take that back. I'm not going to bother with PHP, because I'm that dumb. Spent the early afternoon trying to figure out what I did wrong. Oh well. Another time to mess with PHP will come.<br>

New layout. Made a switch - I felt like "Summer Fling" was more fitting for a blog layout then a writing one. So I made this, after trying out a whole bunch of images to make a layout. Hah. Ironic is it not? In the end I come up with a layout without a single image in it. Oh well. <br>
<br>
But about my writings, I'm currently working on a short prose which I titled "The Gift." The structure of the entire piece is done, now I'm waiting for some critiques by a few of my friends. Once I get the critiques, I'm off to revising it. The idea behind "The Gift" is a nice one, I think (I could just be biased). But the flow of the plotline is choppy so I know it is going to take a while. Bleh. >_<<br>
