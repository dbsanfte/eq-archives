My spirit's in flight in all my dreams (all my dreams)<br>
A submarine valiantly conquers a virgin sea<br>
A child is born, a child is born<br>
Will U marry me?</p>

<p>I'll teach U tonight (tonight, tonight) in all my dreams (all my dreams)<br>
U'll be so surprised (surprised, surprised) at things U'll see (all my dreams)<br>

Welcome, this is where I live<br>
This is where I dream my dreams<br>
Tonight we'll make love until the world stops turning<br>
U're small but very strong, U move like a cat<br>
It dripped, so insane<br>
He caressed her in her eyes and licked her abdomen<br>
She shivered with delight<br>
Over and over she nibbled his ear<br>
She knew it was wrong 2 have so much fun<br>
He held her tightly until it almost hurt<br>
But his hips, they move so slowly<br>
She wanted 2 stop breathing<br>
U can feel every curve of your womanhood<br>
U can see every thought in his brain<br>
A submarine slowly moves through the virgin sea<br>
Oh so slowly<br>
She wants 2 stop breathing<br>
U can feel every curve</p>

<p>Lisa, I'm going 2 give U the brush and U're going 2 paint the side of the train</p>

<p>&lt; Prince's voice slowed down &gt;<br>
She squeezes tighter as the submarine goes deeper in depth<br>
Into the unnavigated territory<br>
A smile, ever so slight, appears on his face as she starts 2 cry<br>
Until they come together slowly<br>
They rush it, as if they could see a parallel future in the sea<br>
They do not speak<br>
They only stare out this moment</p>

<p>Marry me today and tonight we'll make love until the world stops turning<br>
Gentle, but quickly</p>

<p>We'll travel tonight in all my dreams (all my dreams)<br>
All my dreams (x2)<br>
Goodness will guide us if love is inside us<br>
The colors are brighter, the bond is much tighter<br>
No child's a failure until the blue sailor sails him away from his dreams<br>
Don't ever lose, don't ever lose<br>
Don't ever lose your dreams<br>
Yeah!</p>
