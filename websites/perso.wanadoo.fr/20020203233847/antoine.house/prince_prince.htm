<p>I Wanna Be Your Lover&nbsp;&nbsp; [Ecnirp Music, ASCAP - 1979]&nbsp; [mz] [2/92]<br>
---------------------<br>
I ain't got no money<br>
I ain't like those other guys you hang around<br>
And it's kinda funny<br>
But they always seem to let you down<br>
And I get discouraged<br>
'cause I never see you anymore<br>
And I need your love, babe yeah<br>
That's all I'm living for, yeah<br>
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby<br>
But all I ever wanted to do</p>

<p>I wanna be your lover<br>
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running<br>
I wanna be your lover<br>
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout<br>
Oh, lover!&nbsp; Yeah<br>
I wanna be the only one you come for</p>

<p>I wanna be your brother<br>
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too<br>
There ain't no other<br>
That can do the things that I'll do to you<br>
And I get discouraged<br>
'cause you treat me just like a child<br>
And they say I'm so shy, yeah<br>
But with you I just go wild! <br>
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby.&nbsp; No!<br>
But all I ever wanted to do</p>

<p>I wanna be your lover<br>
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running<br>
I wanna be your lover<br>

<p>Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?&nbsp;&nbsp; [Ecnirp Music, ASCAP - 1979]&nbsp; [mz]
&nbsp;&nbsp; [2/92]<br>
------------------------------<br>
There's some talk going 'round town<br>
That you really don't give a damn<br>
They say you really put me down<br>
When I'm doing the best I can<br>
I gave you all of my love<br>
I even gave you my body<br>
Tell me, baby, ain't that enough?<br>
What more do you want me to do?</p>

<p>I play the fool when we're together<br>
But I cry when we're apart, yeah<br>
I couldn't do you no better<br>
Don't break what left of my broken heart, baby</p>

<p>Why you wanna treat me so bad<br>
When you know I love you?<br>
How can you do this to me<br>
When you know I care?<br>
Why you wanna treat me so bad<br>
When you know I love you?</p>

<p>You know, I try so hard<br>
To keep you satisfied<br>
Sometimes you play the part<br>
Sometimes you're so full of pride<br>
And if it's still good to ya<br>
Why you wanna treat me so bad?<br>
You used to love it when I'd do you<br>
You used to say I was the best you'd ever had</p>

<p>I play the fool when we're together<br>
I give you everything I can, yeah<br>
And if it's still good to ya<br>
There's something that I can't understand<br>
Why you wanna treat me so bad<br>
When you know I love you?<br>
How can you do this to me<br>
When you know I care?<br>
Why you wanna treat me so bad<br>
When you know I love you?<br>

<p>When We're Dancing Close and Slow&nbsp; [Ecnirp Music, ASCAP - 1979]&nbsp; [mz] &nbsp;
[2/92]<br>
---------------------------------<br>
When we're dancing close and slow<br>
I never want to let you go, no, no<br>
I feel your warm embrace<br>
The softness of your face<br>
Tell me, baby, are we here alone?</p>

<p>When we're kissing long and hard<br>
I can almost taste the thoughts within your mind<br>
Sex-related fantasy is all that my mind can see<br>
Baby, that's honestly the way I feel</p>

<p>When we're dancing close and slow<br>
I'm not afraid to let my feelings show<br>
I want to come inside of you<br>
I want to hold you when we're through<br>
Can't you feel my love touching you?<br>
@SONG: With You</p>

<p>With You&nbsp;&nbsp; [Ecnirp Music, ASCAP - 1979]&nbsp; [mz]&nbsp;&nbsp; [2/92]<br>
--------<br>
I've held your hand so many times<br>
But I still get the feeling I felt the very first time<br>
I've kissed your lips and laid with you<br>
And I cherish every moment we spend in each other's arms</p>

<p>I guess my eyes can only see as far as you<br>
I only want to be with you<br>
We've come so far in so little time<br>
Sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be<br>
Sometimes you are so very kind<br>
That the nights you're not with me I'm scared that you're gonna leave</p>

<p>I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool<br>
But I only want to be with you</p>

<p>I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool<br>
But I always, always want to be with you<br>

<p>@SONG: Bambi</p>

<p>Bambi&nbsp; [Ecnirp Music, ASCAP - 1979]&nbsp;&nbsp; [mz]&nbsp; [2/92]<br>
-----<br>
I knew from the start<br>
That I loved you with all my heart<br>
But you were untrue.<br>
You had another lover and she looked just like you</p>

<p>Bambi, can't you understand?<br>
Bambi, it's better with a man</p>

<p>It's so hard to believe<br>
Maybe it's because you're so young<br>
Or maybe I'm just too naive<br>
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun</p>

<p>Bambi, can't you understand?<br>
Bambi, it's better with a man<br>
All your lovers--they look just like you<br>
But they can only do the things that you do<br>
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand<br>
I'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man</p>

<p>Bambi, I know what you need<br>
Bambi, maybe you need to bleed<br>
Yeah!</p>

Still Waiting&nbsp; [Ecnirp Music, ASCAP - 1979]&nbsp; [mz]&nbsp; [2/92]<br>
------------<br>
All my friends tell me<br>
About the loves they've had<br>
Can't they see what they're doing to me?<br>
It makes me feel so bad<br>
'Cause I'm so alone<br>
And brokenhearted<br>
It ain't like my life is ended<br>
But more like it never started<br>
The love my friends rap about I keep anticipating<br>
I try so hard but don't you know, my patience is fading away</p>

<p>Still waiting<br>
I'm waiting for that love<br>
Still waiting<br>
I wish on every star above<br>
Still waiting<br>
Waiting for the love to come around<br>
Oh, love.&nbsp; <br>
Waiting for the love to come around</p>

<p>People say that I'm too young<br>
Too young to fall in love<br>
But they don't know, they really don't know<br>
That's all that I've been dreaming of<br>
'Cause I spend my nights just a-crying<br>
And I spend my days just a-trying<br>
To find that love to call my own<br>
'Cause I'm sick and tired of being alone</p>

<p>Still waiting<br>
Waiting for that love<br>
Still waiting<br>
I wish on every star above<br>
Still waiting<br>
I'm waiting for the love to come around.<br>
(Waiting for the love)&nbsp; Don't you know that I'm waiting<br>
(Waiting for the love)&nbsp; Say..<br>
(Waiting for the love)&nbsp; To come around now</p>

<p>I need somebody to hold on to baby<br>
Waiting and waiting, don't you know that I'm</p>

<p>Still waiting<br>
I'm waiting for the love, sugar<br>
Still waiting<br>
If you're out there girl, please come to me<br>
Still waiting<br>
Don't make me cry no more<br>
Still waiting<br>
If you're out there, baby, please come to me<br>
Still waiting<br>
Wishing and wishing for days, baby<br>
Still waiting<br>
If you're out there, girl, please come to me<br>
Still waiting<br>

--------------<br>
Baby, baby, when I look at you<br>
I get a warm feeling inside<br>
There's something about the things you do<br>

--------------------<br>
We've been together for quite some time<br>
I'd think by now you'd know<br>
It would take forever to get you off my mind<br>
If ever you decide to go<br>
I guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you<br>
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave<br>
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue</p>

<p>And I'd be so lonely</p>

<p>Without you loving me<br>
I know it's gonna be lonely<br>
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely</p>

<p>Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on<br>
'til I go right out of my mind<br>
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree<br>
It gets me every time<br>
I betcha thatcha never knew that in my dreams you are the star<br>
The only bummer is that you always want to leave<br>
Who do you think you are<br>
Don't you know it's gonna be lonely<br>
Without you loving me<br>
I know it's gonna be lonely<br>
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely</p>

<p>Without you loving me<br>
Giving me everything that I need<br>
Oh pretty baby, can't you see<br>
It's gonna be lonely</p>

<p>Without you loving me<br>
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely<br>
Oh, whatever's in your kiss<br>
I never could resist<br>
Oh, baby don't go!</p>

<p>We've been together for quite some time<br>
It'd take forever to get you off my mind<br>
Oh, girl!</p>

<p>Without you loving me<br>
I know it's gonna be lonely<br>
Without you by my side<br>
