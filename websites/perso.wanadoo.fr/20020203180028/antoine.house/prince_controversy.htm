<p>We live in a world overrun by tourists<br>
Tourists -- 89 flowers on their back...inventors of the Accu-jack<br>
They look at life through a pocket camera... What?&nbsp; No flash again?<br>
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that Love is bad<br>
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation<br>
Mama, are u listening?<br>
We need a new breed -- Leaders, Stand Up, Organize<br>
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read<br>
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight and breed<br>
No child is bad from the beginning... they only imitate their atmosphere<br>
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol and US history<br>
What's to be expected is 3 minus 3... absolutely nothing</p>
