  PRINCE TALKS</strong><br>

<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE PHONE RINGS 
  at 4:48 in the morning.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;Hi, it's Prince,&quot; says the wide-awake voice calling from a room several 
  yards down the hallway of this London hotel. &quot;Did I wake you up?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Though it's assumed that Prince does in fact sleep, no one on his summer European 
  Nude Tour can pinpoint precisely when. Prince seems to relish the aura of night 
  stalker; his vampire hours have been part of his mad-genius myth ever since 
  he was waging junior-high-school battles on Minneapolis's mostly black North 
  Side.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;Anyone who was around back then knew what was happening,&quot; Prince 
  had said two days earlier, reminiscing, &quot;I was working. When they were 
  sleeping, I was jamming. When they woke up, I had another groove. I'm as insane 
  that way now as I was back then.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  For proof, he'd produced a crinkled dime-store notebook that he carries with 
  him like Linus's blanket. Empty when his tour started in May, the book is nearly 
  full, with twenty-one new songs scripted in perfect grammar-school penmanship. 
  He has also been laboring over his movie musical Graffiti Bridge, which was 
  supposed to be out this past summer and is now set for release in November. 
  Overseeing the dubbing and editing of the film by way of dressing-room VCRs 
  and hotel telephones, Prince said, has given him an idea. &quot;One of these 
  day,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm going to work on just one project, and take my 
  time.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Despite his all-hours intensity, the man still has his manners. He wouldn't 
  have called this late, Prince says apologetically, if he didn't have some interesting 
  news. He'd already provided some news earlier in the week, detailing, among 
  other things, a late-night crisis of conscience a few years back that led him 
  not only to shelve the infamous Black Album but also to try and change the way 
  he wrote his songs -- and led his life.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The crisis didn't involve a leap or a loss of faith, Prince has said, but simply 
  the realization that it was time to stop acting like such and angry soul. &quot;I 
  was an expert at cutting off people in my life and disappearing without a glance 
  back, never to return,&quot; he'd said. &quot;Half the things people were writing 
  about me were true.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  But what's never been true, he felt, was what people have written about his 
  music. Until, that is, just this minute. It seems that a fresh batch of reviews 
  of the soundtrack of Graffiti Bridge were faxed from Minneapolis to the hotel 
  while Prince was performing one of his fifteen sold-out concerts in England.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  What Prince has read in the New York Times has astounded him. &quot;They're 
  starting to get it,&quot; he says from his phone in the Wellington Suite, which 
  he has turned into a homey workplace with the addition of some bolts of sheer 
  rainbow-colored cloth, film equipment, a stereo and tacked-up museum-shop posters 
  of Billie Holiday and Judy Garland. &quot;I don't believe it,&quot; he says 
  again, &quot;but they're getting it!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  They, in this case, are members of the rock intelligentsia who have alternately 
  canonized and defrocked Prince. In the past, he has derided his professional 
  interpreters as &quot;mamma jammas&quot; and &quot;skinny sidewinders.&quot; 
  Two days ago, it became obvious that his epithets, but now his feelings, had 
  tempered concerning those who would judge him.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;There's nothing a critic can tell me that I can learn from,&quot; Prince 
  had said earlier. &quot;If they were musicians, maybe. But I hate reading about 
  what some guy sitting at a desk thinks about me. You know, 'he's back, and he's 
  black,' or 'He's back, and he's bad.' Whew! Now, on Graffiti Bridge, they're 
  saying I'm back and more traditional. Well, 'Thieves in the Temple' and 'Tick, 
  Tick, Bang' don't sound like nothing I've ever done before.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  But hadn't he been cheered by the album's almost uniformly rave notices? &quot;That's 
  not what it's about,&quot; Prince had said. &quot;No one's mentioning the lyrics. 
  Maybe I should have put in a lyric sheet.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Now, in predawn London, he's called to say he was wrong. &quot;They're starting 
  to get it,&quot; he says one last time, unbothered by the fact that the Times 
  article trashes his lyrics. That's okay, he says, because &quot;they're paying 
  attention.&quot; Sounding more amazed than pleased, Prince hangs up the phone 
  and goes back to his dime-store notebook.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED since Prince opened the passenger door to his 1966 Thunderbird 
  and took me on a three-day schlep around the hometown he has never left. When 
  I finally got out, I felt like Melvin Dummar, the doofus milkman who claimed 
  to have driven through the Nevada desert with a surprisingly human Howard Hughes. 
  No one had believed Melvin, and no one, I thought, would believe Prince was 
  a being orbiting so close to planet Earth. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Not that Prince hadn't shown some signs of unease with his still-new superstardom. 
  Alone, he's been animated, funny and self-aware. But out in public, even walking 
  into places as hospitable as Minneapolis's First Avenue club, he would palpably 
  stiffen at the first sign of a gawk, his face set in granite, his voice reduced 
  to a mumble.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Now Prince seems more open and comfortable, less likely to slip into stridency. 
  &quot;You have a few choices when you're in that position,&quot; he says, remembering 
  the first year after Purple Rain. &quot;You can get all jacked up on yourself 
  and curse everybody, or you can say this is the way life is and try to enjoy 
  it. I'm still learning that lesson. I think I'll always be learning that lesson. 
  I think I'm a much nicer person now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  This isn't to say that Prince has turned into Dale Carnegie -- he still has 
  the hauteur of a star. But something has changed; his philosophy no longer seems 
  to hinge on things like the size of one's boot heels. &quot;Cool means being 
  able to hang with yourself,&quot; he says. &quot;All you have to ask yourself 
  is 'Is there anybody I'm afraid of? Is there anybody who if I walked into a 
  room and saw, I'd get nervous?' If not, then you're cool.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Many things, however, have stayed the same. Prince is still very funny. (&quot;You 
  can always renegotiate a record contract. You just go in and say, 'You know, 
  I think my next project will be a country &amp; western album.'&quot;)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  He can still play the cocky rocker. &quot;I don't go to awards shows anymore,&quot; 
  he says. &quot;I'm not saying I'm better than anybody else. But you'll be sitting 
  there at the Grammys, and U2 will beat you. And you say to yourself, 'Wait a 
  minute. I can play that kind of music, too. I played La Crosse [Wisconsin] growing 
  up, I know how to do that, you dig? But you will not do 'Housequake.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  His grasp of history and current events remains quirky. Prince can cite chapter 
  and verse from biographies of Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis, but he seems 
  genuinely unaware that his own life story was turned into a book by an English 
  rock critic. He knows, blow by blow, the events in the Mideast, relating the 
  crisis to everything from the predictions of Nostradamus to the drug-interdiction 
  policy of George Bush. But he hasn't yet heard of 2 Live Crew.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  There is still some residue of emotional pain. &quot;What if everybody around 
  me split?&quot; he asks. &quot;Then I'd be left with only me, and I'd have to 
  fend for me. That's why I have to protect me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince's detractors might diagnose these words as the classic pathology of a 
  control freak. His high-minded supporters might say those are normal protective 
  feelings for somebody who was kicked onto the streets by his beloved father 
  at age fourteen. Prince himself, however, echoes Popeye more than Freud as he 
  analyzes just who he is. &quot;I am what I am,&quot; he says. &quot;I feel if 
  I can please myself musically, then I can please others, too.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Finally, there is one more philosophy unchanged with the years. &quot;I play 
  music,&quot; Prince has said. &quot;I make records. I make movies. I don't do 
  interviews.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  So what are we doing? &quot;We're just talking,&quot; he says. Hence, his decision 
  not to be taped or allow notes to be taken or even a pad of questions to be 
  brought out. That would inhibit him, he says; that would mean doing the thing 
  that he just doesn't do. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  No, Prince vows, he isn't trying to be a purposeful pain. What he says he simply 
  wants to avoid is &quot;that big Q followed by that big A, followed by line 
  after line of me either defending myself or cleaning up stories that people 
  have told about me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  No matter what he might say in a traditional interview, Prince continues, he'd 
  only end up looking ridiculous. &quot;Some magazine a little while ago promised 
  me their cover if I answered five written questions,&quot; he says. &quot;The 
  first one was 'What are your exact beliefs about God?' Now how can I answer 
  that without sounding like a fool?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  True. But isn't he afraid of being misquoted? No, he says softly, staring at 
  the holstered tape recorder on the table before him. When Prince says no, with 
  pursed lips and a slight shake of the head, it carries a certain finality.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Still, in the coming days he addresses just about everything short of Kim Basinger 
  (&quot;I really don't know her that well&quot;) or anybody else he's dating 
  (&quot;I never publicize that. My friends around town are surprised when I introduce 
  them to someone I'm seeing&quot;).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;And you really would feel better having your words taken down the second 
  you say them?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Okay.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  A COUPLE OF NIGHTS LATER, Prince is dealing with the painstaking minutiae of 
  piecing together his almost-finished movie. &quot;People are going, 'Oh, this 
  is Prince's big gamble,'&quot; he says, sitting on the floor of his London hotel 
  room, fast-forwarding a video version of his most recent cut. &quot;What gamble? 
  I made a $7 million movie with somebody else's money, and I'm sitting here finishing 
  it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince stops the tape at a point when gospel queen Mavis Staples is leaning 
  out of a window in Minneapolis's Seven Corners, waxing wise on the night action 
  down the street. The movie appears to be set in the 1950s, when Seven Corners 
  was a Midwestern hotbed of clubs and hipsters. The Seven Corners set, raised 
  on the Paisley Park sound stage, resembles the kind of backdrop used in Gene 
  Kelly musicals. &quot;Yeah, cheap!&quot; says Prince with a laugh. &quot;Actually, 
  that's okay. It's like how we did Dirty Mind. But man, what I'd do with a $25 
  million budget. I'll need a big success to get that, but I'll get it, I will 
  get it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Film-speak is now part of his vocabulary; the first director Prince mentions 
  he admires is Woody Allen, &quot;because I like anyone who gets final cut.&quot; 
  Movies have also worked their way into his philosophical references. &quot;If 
  you're making your moves in life because of money or pride,&quot; he says, &quot;then 
  you'll end up like that dude who got beat up on the grass at the end of Wall 
  Street. He'd been wheeling and dealing, then oomph! That's what time it was.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  He's been studying, he says, and learning from his own film failures. &quot;I 
  don't regret anything about Under the Cherry Moon,&quot; he says. &quot;I learned 
  that I can't direct what I didn't write.&quot; Participating in Batman, meantime, 
  allowed him to spy on the making of a megaton hit. Composing songs on locations, 
  Prince mostly stayed on the sidelines and just watched. &quot;There was so much 
  pressure on [director] Tim [Burton],&quot; he says, &quot;that for the whole 
  picture, I just said, 'Yes, Mr. Burton, what would you like?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Burton had hired him on the recommendation of Jack Nicholson, a longtime Prince 
  fan. Prince, who'd never met Nicholson before, found the inspiration for &quot;Partyman&quot; 
  when he first saw the actor on the set. &quot;He just walked over, sat down 
  and put his foot up on a table, real cool,&quot; Prince says. &quot;He had this 
  attitude that reminded me of Morris [Day] -- and there was that song.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince says he'll survive if Graffiti Bridge is less than a blockbuster. &quot;I 
  can't please everybody,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn't want to make Die Hard 
  4. But I'm also not looking to be Francis Ford Coppola. I see this more like 
  those 1950s rock &amp; roll movies.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Unfortunately, rumors have swirled for months that better comparison might be 
  the 1959 howler Plan 9 From Outer Space. &quot;I don't mind,&quot; says Prince. 
  &quot;Some might not get it. But people also said Purple Rain was unreleasable. 
  And now I drive to work each morning to my own big studio.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Originally, Graffiti Bridge was going to be a vehicle for the reborn Time, with 
  Prince staying behind the camera. But Warner Bros. wouldn't go for it, so Prince 
  wrote himself into a new movie. Later, visitors to Paisley Park saw a version 
  of a script that was allegedly obtuse to the point of near gibberish. &quot;That 
  was just a real rough thirty-page treatment I wrote with Kim,&quot; Prince says. 
  &quot;Graffiti Bridge is an entirely different movie.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  As in Purple Rain, the plot features Prince as a musician named the Kid. Willed 
  half-ownership of a Seven Corners club named Glam Slam, the Kid must share control 
  with Morris Day, once again playing a comic satyr combining Superfly smoothness 
  and Buddy Love sincerity. It's a fight of good versus evil, and band versus 
  band, for the soul of Glam Slam.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Then there's the unknown Ingrid Chavez, Prince's first female movie lead who 
  doesn't look like she was ordered out of a catalog. Throw in the talents of 
  Staples, the reborn Time, George Clinton, and the thirteen-year-old Quincy Jones 
  prot&eacute;g&eacute; Tevin Campbell, and you've got, Prince says, &quot;a different 
  kind of movie. It's not violent. Nobody gets laid.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  It's impossible to judge Graffiti Bridge from just a few selected scenes. Still, 
  they were very good scenes. Prince fast-forwards to a sequence in which Day 
  tries to seduce Chavez on the fairy-tale-looking Graffiti Bridge.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  When Prince is amused, which is almost every time Morris Day comes on the screen, 
  he slaps his hands, shakes his head and throws himself back in his seat. &quot;I 
  hope Morris steals this movie,&quot; he says, recalling the charge made after 
  Purple Rain. &quot;The man still thinks he can whup me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince pushes rewind, searching for a scene with the Time. Waiting, he reminisces 
  about the old days, when he oversaw the band. For a tutorial on the proper onstage 
  attitude, Prince remembers, he showed the Time videos of Muhammed Ali trouncing, 
  and then taunting, the old champ Sonny Liston. &quot;To this day,&quot; he says, 
  &quot;they're the only band I've ever been afraid of.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  At first it seems strange for to hear Prince talking in such fond and nostalgic 
  terms about Day and the band. Day left the Minneapolis fold right after Purple 
  Rain, with some nasty words about the boss's supposedly dictatorial ways. Now, 
  Prince says, &quot;I honestly don't remember how we got it together again.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Day's old charge of overbossing, however, brings a quirkier and crosser memory. 
  &quot;That whole thing came from my early days, when I was working with a lot 
  of people who weren't exactly designed for their jobs,&quot; Prince says. &quot;I 
  had to do a lot, and I had to have control, because a lot of them didn't know 
  exactly what was needed.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The most often-told tale involves Prince firing the then-unknown Jimmy Jam and 
  Terry Lewis from the Time in 1982. Jam and Lewis, all parties now agree, left 
  a Time tour on a day off to produce their first record for the SOS Band. A freak 
  snowstorm in Atlanta grounded them for an extra day, and the two missed a gig. 
  When Jam and Lewis returned, they were summarily fired. Jobless, the two missed 
  Purple Rain, so they set up as producers and went scrounging for clients. In 
  the years since, they've produced everyone from Janet Jackson to Herb Alpert, 
  becoming the other superpower on the Minneapolis music scene.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;I'm playing the bad guy,&quot; says Prince, &quot;but I didn't fire Jimmy 
  and Terry. Morris asked me what I would do in his situation. Remember, it was 
  his band.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Despite the rap, Prince says, he harbors no ill will toward the now-famous producers 
  working across town from Paisley Park at their Flyte Time studios. &quot;We're 
  friends,&quot; he says. &quot;We know each other like brothers. Jimmy always 
  gave me a lot of credit for getting things going in Minneapolis, and I'm hip 
  to that. Terry's more aloof, but I know that.&quot; And their music? &quot;Terry 
  and Jimmy aren't into the Minneapolis sound,&quot; Prince says. &quot;They're 
  into making every single one of their records a hit. Not that there's anything 
  wrong with that, we're just different.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  With this, Prince cues up the Graffiti Bridge movie to the sequence in which 
  the Time performs &quot;Shake!&quot; The scene looks like something Busby Berkeley 
  would have cooked up if he had choreographed funk. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The Time, Prince says, is proof of the good that can come from a group dissolving 
  and eventually coming back together. &quot;They broke up because they'd run 
  out of ideas,&quot; he says. &quot;They went off and did their own thing, and 
  now they're terrifying.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince said this formula was just what he had in mind when, in short order, 
  he broke up the Revolution. &quot;I felt we all needed to grow,&quot; he says. 
  &quot;We all needed to play a wide range of music with different types of people. 
  Then we could come back eight times as strong.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;No band can do everything,&quot; he continues. &quot;For instance, this 
  band I'm with now is funky. With them, I can drag out 'Baby I'm a Star' all 
  night! I just keep switching gears on them, and something else funky will happen. 
  I couldn't do that with the Revolution. They were a different kind of funky, 
  more electronic and cold. The Revolution could tear up 'Darling Nikki,' which 
  was about the coldest song ever written But I wouldn't even think about playing 
  that song with this band.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The breakup of the Revolution apparently didn't go down easy. Today, Prince's 
  relationship with his onetime best friends Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman is 
  somewhere between uncomfortable and estranged. &quot;I talk to Wendy and Lisa, 
  but it's like this,&quot; Prince says, moving his hands in opposite directions. 
  &quot;I still hear a lot of hurt from them, and that bothers me. When I knew 
  them, they were two spunky, wonderful human beings. I honestly don't know what 
  they're hurt about.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  So far, Prince says, the two women haven't listened to the few tidbits of advice 
  he has offered. For their first video, Prince recommended that they try to announce 
  themselves by making a splash, by &quot;doing something like jumping off a speaker 
  with smoke pouring out everywhere. Something.&quot; When he saw the video, however, 
  Wendy was sitting in a chair, playing her guitar. &quot;You can't do that when 
  you're just getting established -- kids watching MTV see that and they go click,&quot;Prince 
  says, miming a channel being changed. &quot;They'd rather watch a commercial.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Still, Prince's pronouncements seem proffered more in mourning than in malice. 
  &quot;Wendy and Lisa are going to have to do some more serious soul-searching 
  and decide what they want to write about,&quot; he says sadly and shakes his 
  head. &quot;I don't know what Wendy and Lisa are so hurt about. I wish I did, 
  but I don't.&quot;</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  IT'S A BROILING SUMMER AFTERNOON IN NICE, FRANCE and Prince is performing before 
  an almost completely empty soccer stadium. It's a sound check, and Prince and 
  his band have been going for over an hour, segueing from John Lee Hooker's &quot;I'm 
  in the Mood&quot; to the freeform jamming in &quot;Respect.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  After the check, Prince retreats to the bowels of the stadium to wait for night. 
  Camped out in his dressing room under a gaucho hat, Prince plugs in a tape bearing 
  some early versions of some songs he's written on tour. Prince says the first 
  song, called &quot;Schoolyard,&quot; is about &quot;the first time I got any.&quot; 
  Funny and funky, the song is an inner-city Summer of '42 that tells the story 
  of a fumbling sixteen-year-old-boy trying to seduce a girl to the strains of 
  a Tower of Power album. &quot;I think that's something everybody can relate 
  to,&quot; he says.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Still, that probably wouldn't prevent the song from getting a parental-warning 
  sticker. &quot;I don't mind that,&quot; Prince says. &quot;I think parents have 
  a right to know what their children are listening to.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  At first it seems an unlikely sentiment coming from the man who once wrote about 
  the onanistic doings of a woman sitting with a magazine in a hotel lobby. But 
  Prince hasn't turned into a bluenose, he insists -- he's just changed his outlook 
  on how to present his still eros-heavy creations.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The change, he says, came soon after he finished the Black Album, in 1987. The 
  reason the album was pulled from release had nothing to do with record-company 
  pressure, he insists, or with the quality of the songs. Rather, Prince says, 
  he aborted the project because of one particular dark night of the soul &quot;when 
  a lot of things happened all in a few hours.&quot; He won't get specific, saying 
  only that he saw the word God. &quot;And when I talk about God,&quot; he says, 
  &quot;I don't mean some dude in a cape and beard coming down to Earth. To me, 
  he's in everything if you look at it that way.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;I was very angry a lot of the time back then,&quot; he continues, &quot;and 
  that was reflected in that album. I suddenly realized that we can die at any 
  moment, and we'd be judged by the last thing we left behind. I didn't want that 
  angry, bitter thing to be the last thing. I learned from that album, but I don't 
  want to go back.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  By the time of the album Lovesexy, Prince says, he was a certifiably nicer human 
  being -- and a happier creator. &quot;I feel good most of the time, and I like 
  to express that by writing from joy,&quot; he says. &quot;I still do write from 
  anger sometimes, like 'Thieves in the Temple.' But I don't like to. It's not 
  a place to live.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  He's been angling for a different effect on each album he has made in the last 
  few years. &quot;What people were saying about Sign o' the Times was 'There 
  are some great songs on it, and there are some experiments on it.' I hate the 
  word experiment -- it sounds like something you didn't finish. Well, they have 
  to understand that's the way to have a double record and make it interesting.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Lovesexy, Prince says, was &quot;a mind trip, like a psychedelic movie. Either 
  you went with it and had a mind-blowing experience or you didn't. All that album 
  cover was, was a picture. If you looked at that picture and some ill come out 
  of your mouth, then that's what you are -- it's looking right back at you in 
  the mirror.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The Graffiti Bridge soundtrack, a couple cuts of which have been floating around 
  for a few years, &quot;is just a whole bunch of songs,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody 
  does any experiments or anything like that. But I still want to know how it 
  stands up to the other albums. I'm always going forward, always trying to surprise 
  myself. It's not about hits. I knew how to make hits by my second album.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Not that Prince is above appreciating a good old Number One with a bullet -- 
  especially when he wrote it. &quot;I love it, it's great!&quot; he exclaims 
  when asked about Sinead O'Connor's version of &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U,&quot; 
  which Prince wrote in 1985 for the Paisley Park act the Family. Is he sorry 
  he didn't get to sing the song before O'Connor? &quot;Nah,&quot; Prince says. 
  &quot;I look for cosmic meaning in everything. I think we just took that song 
  as far as we could, then someone else was supposed to come along and pick it 
  up.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  While being so productive on his own, Prince has also found time to produce 
  such disparate talents as Mavis Staples, George Clinton and Bonnie Raitt. &quot;The 
  best thing about producing is that there are so many really talented people 
  who just never got that push over the top,&quot; he says. &quot;Without that 
  push, they just get lost.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Raitt was perhaps his most talked-about reclamation project. &quot;Oh, those 
  sessions were kicking!&quot; Prince says. But nothing was ever released -- a 
  fact which Prince takes the blame for. &quot;There was no particular reason 
  it didn't come out,&quot; he says. &quot;I was just working on a lot of things 
  at the same time, and I didn't give myself enough time to work with her. I used 
  to do that a lot -- start five different projects and only get a couple done. 
  That's the biggest thing I'm working on: patience and planning.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  What Prince listens to on his own time is a grab bag. He likes rap: he's recently 
  signed rappers T.C. Ellis and Robin Power to record on his Paisley Park label 
  but denies that he'll be producing songs for M.C. Hammer. &quot;I like his stuff 
  a lot,&quot; Prince says. &quot;We've talked but not about working together.&quot; 
  He also gives highly favorable mentions to the likes of Madonna, Michael Jackson, 
  Patti LaBelle and Bette Midler. &quot;I'm not real into Bruce Springsteen's 
  music,&quot; he says, &quot;but I have a lot of respect for his talent.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince and Springsteen occasionally exchange notes; in recalling a Springsteen 
  concert he saw from backstage a few years back, Prince displays the respect 
  of a general reviewing another man's army. &quot;I admire the way he holds his 
  audience -- there's one man whose fans I could never take away,&quot; he says 
  with a laugh. And how does he compare their stage tactics? &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; 
  says Prince. &quot;But at one point, his band started going off somewhere. Springsteen 
  turned around and shot the band one terrifying look. You know they got right 
  back on it!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  For his own enjoyment, however, Prince just relies on himself. &quot;I like 
  a lot of people's music, and I'm interested in what's going on,&quot; he says, 
  &quot;but I don't listen to them. When I'm getting ready to go out or driving 
  in the car, I listen to my own stuff. Never the old stuff. That's the way it's 
  always been.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince walks back over to the stereo and plays with the cassette of his latest 
  creations until he finds a number featuring Rosie Gaines, the band's unknown 
  keyboardist and vocalist, who may be the next big star to come out of Prince's 
  camp.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;Terrifying,&quot; says Prince, shaking his head. &quot;Simply terrifying.&quot;</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  IT'S ANOTHER SWELTERING AFTERNOON in another soccer stadium, this time in Lucerne, 
  Switzerland. It's as tame as a church picnic in the dressing rooms; drugs have 
  long been a firing offense, and even cigarettes have been forbidden from the 
  entire area. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Killing time in the hallway, the members of Prince's band seem more like the 
  kind of winning, good-natured characters in a script for the television show 
  Fame than jaded road warriors. Gaines is doing her imitation of Daisy Duck as 
  a soul sister. &quot;Be quiet, boyfriend!&quot; she quacks. &quot;What's happening, 
  baby?&quot; goes a squawk directed at fellow keyboardist Matt &quot;Doctor&quot; 
  Fink.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Fink, the only member of the Revolution still playing with Prince, has just 
  read in the USA Today of a 2 Live Crew parody made by a group called 2 Live 
  Jews. Shticking in his own estimable Jewish-man voice, Fink begins rapping: 
  &quot;Oy, it's so humid!&quot; Over in the corner, Michael Bland is poring over 
  a purple copy of The Portable Nietzsche. A corpulent twenty-year-old drummer, 
  Bland is probably the most fearsome-looking band member. Actually, he's a scholarly 
  innocent who still lives with his parents in Minneapolis and still plays drums 
  in his Pentecostal church. &quot;Nietzsche's cool,&quot; Bland says, putting 
  down his book. &quot;But Schopenhauer -- now there's a brother with no hope!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Also lolling in the hall are Miko Weaver, a hunkish guitarist, and Levi Seacer, 
  Jr., a thoughtful bass player, who has been entrusted with speaking to the European 
  press about this roadshow. The Nude Tour is a greatest-hits production with 
  lean arrangements and none of the Liberace-on-acid costumes and special effects 
  of the Lovesexy tour.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince, hanging out behind a closed door a few feet away from his band, makes 
  no apology for the show's programming. &quot;Kids save a lot of money for a 
  long time to buy tickets, and I like to give them what they want,&quot; he says. 
  &quot;When I was a kid, I didn't want to hear James Brown play something I never 
  heard before. I wanted to hear him play something I knew, so I could dance.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  For now, Prince has no plans to bring his tour to the states, The main reason, 
  he says, is that he wants to get back to Minneapolis and the studio. Prince 
  also says that Warner Bros. is pouring increasingly large amounts of cash into 
  Paisley Park Records, which means he must &quot;put in some serious time behind 
  the desk.&quot; It was only a couple of years ago that Prince was rumored to 
  be in financial straits. But Forbes magazine that in 1989, Prince earned $20 
  million in pretax profit, and the New York Times recently reported that his 
  Paisley Park empire was quite solvent. &quot;We're doing okay&quot; is all that 
  Prince will say.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  He has other reasons for wanting to get back home. Prince wants to get rolling 
  an a screenplay he has been working on with Gilbert Davison, his best friend, 
  his chief adjutant and the owner and proprietor of the soon-to-open Minneapolis 
  nightclub Glam Slam.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince has lent the club his full endorsement as well as its name, the motorcycle 
  from Purple Rain and some of his more-historic guitars. &quot;Glam Slam's gonna 
  kick ass,&quot; Prince says. &quot;It'll be one of those joints that's remembered! 
  I've always just wanted to have a place where I knew I could just show up and 
  my stuff would be there, so I wouldn't have to jump onstage with equipment meant 
  for Dwight Yoakam.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The point of helping Davison, Prince says, goes far beyond nepotism. &quot;Glam 
  Slam will be another thing to center Minneapolis in the national eye,&quot; 
  he says. &quot;People talk about the Minneapolis sound or the Minneapolis scene, 
  but they don't really know what the place looks like or means. I want it to 
  mean something.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  For Prince, the place still mostly means home. &quot;It feels like music to 
  me there,&quot; he says. &quot;You don't feel prejudice there. I know it exists, 
  but you don't feel it as much. I can just drive around the lakes or go into 
  stores without bodyguards or just hand out.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Nursing a cold and chewing on Sudafed, Prince excuses himself to rest up for 
  the show. The next time he appears in the doorway, his intimidating game face 
  is on. The band comes in for a last-minute huddle; Paisley Park costume designer 
  Helen Hiatt fixes a crucifix necklace big enough to scare off Nosferatu.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;It's raining,&quot; Davison says to Prince. &quot;It's raining&quot; is 
  Prince's mumbled reply, accompanied by a thousand-yard stare. Moments later, 
  an army of damp and screaming Swiss teenagers hear the first beats of &quot;1999.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The oldies come, as do some nifty hommages beyond the requisite James Brown 
  footwork. Prince sings &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot; with a Wilson Pickett 
  wail, the song ending with him crucified on a heart. &quot;Blues,&quot; sung 
  with Rosie Gaines, hearkens to Otis Redding and Carla Thomas doing &quot;Tramp.&quot; 
  &quot;Baby I'm a Star&quot; last twenty-four minutes, and after two encores, 
  Prince is whisked to a backstage BMW that is gone well before the fans stop 
  screaming for more. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Soon after, the band bus is being rocked in the parking lot by highly non-neutral 
  Swiss. &quot;We're the Beatles!&quot; says Michael Bland, giggling and waving 
  to the fans. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;Oy, it's so humid,&quot; raps Dr. Fink.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  AT FOUR IN THE MORNING, flying into their third country in the past twenty-four 
  hours, the band and the entire entourage of about thirty are sacked out in what 
  looks like the sleep of the dead. Everybody's unconscious on this charter, including 
  one of the flight attendants. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  There's movement, however, up in row 1. Prince's headphoned head is bopping 
  against the back of his seat, his arms pounding the armrests. From the back, 
  it looks like a prisoner is being executed in an upholstered electric chair.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Earlier in the day, Prince had refused to make any predictions about his future. 
  &quot;I don't want to say anything than can be held against me later,&quot; 
  he'd said with a laugh. &quot;Mick Jagger said he hoped he wouldn't be singing 
  'Satisfaction' at thirty, and he's still singing it. Pete Townshend wrote, 'Hope 
  I die before I get old.' Well, now he is old, and I do hope he is happy to be 
  around.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  And himself? &quot;When I pray to God, I say, 'It's your call -- when it's time 
  to go, it's time to go.'&quot; Prince had said. &quot;But as long as you're 
  going to leave me here&quot; -- he slapped his hands -- &quot;then I'm going 
  to cause much ruckus!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Now, while his band mates and support staff snooze around him, Prince keeps 
  air-jamming beneath the glare of his seat's tiny spotlight. Listening to a tape 
  of his own performance that day, Prince stays up all night, all the way to London.</font></p>
