  TALKS</strong><br>
  BY NEAL KARLEN</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">John Nelson turns 
  sixty-nine today, and all the semiretired piano man wants for his birthday is 
  to shoot some pool with his firstborn son. &quot;He's real handy with a cue,&quot; 
  says Prince, laughing, as he threads his old white T-bird through his old black 
  neighborhood toward his old man's house. &quot;He's so cool. The old man knows 
  what time it is.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hard time is how 
  life has traditionally been clocked in North Minneapolis; this is the place 
  'Time' forgot twelve years ago when the magazine's cover trumpeted &quot;The 
  Good Life in Minnesota,&quot; alongside a picture of Governor Wendell Anderson 
  holding up a walleye. Though tame and middle-class by Watts and Roxbury standards, 
  the North Side offers some of the few mean streets in town.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The old sights 
  bring out more Babbitt than Badass is Prince as he leads a leisurely tour down 
  the main streets of his inner-city Gopher Prairie. He cruises slowly, respectfully: 
  stopping completely at red lights, flicking on his turn signal even when no 
  one's at an intersection. Gone is the wary Kung Fu Grasshopper voice with which 
  Prince whispers when meeting strangers or accepting Academy Awards. Cruising 
  peacefully with the window down, he's proof in a paisley jump suit that you 
  can always go home again, especially if you never really left town.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tooling through 
  the neighborhood, Prince speaks matter-of-factly of why he toyed with early 
  interviewers about his father and mother, their divorce and his adolescent wanderings 
  between the homes of his parents, friends and relatives. &quot;I used to tease 
  a lot of journalists early on,&quot; he says, &quot;because I wanted them to 
  concentrate on the music and not so much on me coming from a broken home. I 
  really didn't think that was important. What was important was what came out 
  of my system that particular day. I don't live in the past. I don't play my 
  old records for that reason. I make a statement, then move on to the next.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The early facts, 
  for the neo-Freudians: John Nelson, leader of the Prince Rogers jazz trio, knew 
  Mattie Shaw from North Side community dances. A singer sixteen years John's 
  junior, Mattie bore traces of Billie Holiday in her pipes and more than a trace 
  of Indian and Caucasian in her blood. She joined the Prince Rogers trio, sang 
  for a few years around town, married John Nelson and dropped out of the group. 
  She nicknamed her husband after the band; the son who came in 1958 got the nickname 
  on his birth certificate. At home and on the street, the kid was &quot;Skipper.&quot; 
  Mattie and John broke up ten years later, and Prince began his domestic shuttle.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That's where 
  my mom lives,&quot; he says nonchalantly, nodding toward a neatly trimmed house 
  and lawn. &quot;My parents live very close by each other, but they don't talk. 
  My mom's the wild side of me; she's like that all the time. My dad's real serene; 
  it takes the music to get him going. My father and me, we're one and the same.&quot; 
  A wry laugh. &quot;He's a little sick, just like I am.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of North Minneapolis 
  has gone outside this Sunday afternoon to feel summer, that two-week season, 
  locals joke, between winter and road construction. During this scenic tour through 
  the neighborhood, the memories start popping faster. The T-Bird turns left at 
  a wooden two-story church whose steps are lined with bridesmaids in bonnets 
  and ushers in tuxedos hurling rice up at a beaming couple framed in the door. 
  &quot;That was the church I went to growing up,&quot; says Prince. &quot;I wonder 
  who's getting married.&quot; A fat little kid waves, and Prince waves back.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Just all 
  kinds of things here,&quot; he goes on, turning right. &quot;There was a school 
  right there, John Hay. That's where I went to elementary school,&quot; he says, 
  pointing out a field of black tar sprouting a handful of bent metal basketball 
  rims. &quot;And that's where my cousin lives. I used to play there every day 
  when I was twelve, on these streets, football up and down this block. That's 
  his father out there on the lawn.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These lawns are 
  where Prince the adolescent would also amuse his friends with expert imitations 
  of pro wrestlers Mad Dog Vachon and the Crusher. To amuse himself, he learned 
  how to play a couple dozen instruments. At thirteen, he formed Grand Central, 
  his first band, with some high school friends. Grand Central often traveled 
  to local hotels and gyms to band-battle with their black competition: Cohesion, 
  from the derided &quot;bourgeois&quot; South Side, and Flyte Time, which, with 
  the addition of Morris Day, would later evolve into the Time.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prince is fiddling 
  with the tape deck inside the T-Bird. On low volume comes his unreleased &quot;Old 
  Friends 4 Sale,&quot; an arrow-to-the-heart rock ballad about trust and loss. 
  Unlike &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot; -- which Bob Dylan reputedly named 
  after a nearby Minneapolis block -- the lyrics are sad, not bitter. &quot;I 
  don't know too much about Dylan,&quot; says Prince, &quot;but I respect him 
  a lot. 'All Along the Watchtower' is my favorite of his. I heard it first from 
  Jimi Hendrix.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Old Friends 
  4 Sale&quot; ends, and on comes &quot;Strange Relationships,&quot; and as-yet-unreleased 
  dance tune. &quot;Is it too much?&quot; asks Prince about playing his own songs 
  in his own car. &quot;Not long ago I was driving around L.A. with [a well-known 
  rock star], and all he did was play his own stuff over and over. If it gets 
  too much, just tell me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He turns onto Plymouth, 
  the North Side's main strip. When Martin Luther King got shot, it was Plymouth 
  Avenue that burned. &quot;We used to go to that McDonald's there,&quot; he says. 
  &quot;I didn't have any money, so I'd just stand outside there and smell stuff. 
  Poverty makes people angry, brings out their worst side. I was very bitter when 
  I was young. I was insecure and I'd attack anybody. I couldn't keep a girlfriend 
  for two weeks. We'd argue about anything.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Across the street 
  from McDonald's, Prince spies a smaller landmark. He points to a vacant corner 
  phone booth and remembers a teenage fight with a strict and unforgiving father. 
  &quot;That's where I called my dad and begged him to take me back after he kicked 
  me out,&quot; he begins softly. &quot;He said no, so I called my sister and 
  asked her to ask him. So she did, and afterward told me that all I had to do 
  was call him back, tell him I was sorry, and he's take me back. So I did, and 
  he still said no. I sat crying at that phone booth for two hours. That's the 
  last time I cried.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the years between 
  that phone-booth breakdown and today's pool game came forgiveness. Says Prince, 
  &quot;Once I made it, got my first record contract, got my name on a piece of 
  paper and a little money in my pocket, I was able to forgive. Once I was eating 
  every day, I became a much nicer person.&quot; But it took many more years for 
  the son to understand what a jazzman father needed to survive. Prince figured 
  it out when he moved into his purple house.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I can be 
  upstairs at the piano, and Rande [his cook] can come in,&quot; he says. &quot;Her 
  footsteps will be in a different time, and it's real weird when you hear something 
  that's a totally different rhythm than what you're playing. A lot of times that's 
  mistaken for conceit or not having a heart. But it's not. And my dad's the same 
  way, and that's why it was hard for him to live with anybody. I didn't realize 
  that until recently. When he was working or thinking, he had a private pulse 
  going constantly inside him. I don't know, your bloodstream beats differently.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prince pulls the 
  T-Bird into an alley behind a street of neat frame houses, stops behind a wooden 
  one-car garage and rolls down the window. Relaxing against a tree is a man who 
  looks like Cab Calloway. Dressed in a crisp white suit, collar and tie, a trim 
  and smiling John Nelson adjusts his best cuff links and waves. &quot;Happy birthday,&quot; 
  says the son. &quot;Thanks,&quot; says the father, laughing. Nelson says he's 
  not even allowing himself a piece of cake on his birthday. &quot;No, not this 
  year,&quot; he says with a shake of the head. Pointing at his son, Nelson continues, 
  &quot;I'm trying to take off ten pounds I put on while visiting him in Los Angeles. 
  He eats like I want to eat, but exercises, which I certainly don't.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Father then asks 
  son if maybe he should drive himself to the pool game so he won't have to be 
  hauled all the way back afterward. Prince says okay, and Nelson, chuckling, 
  says to the stranger, &quot;Hey, let me show you what I got for my birthday 
  two years ago.&quot; He goes over to the garage and gives a tug on the door 
  handle. Squeezed inside is a customized deep-purple BMW. On the rear seat is 
  a copy of Prince's latest LP, Around the World in a Day. While the old man gingerly 
  back the car out, Prince smiles. &quot;He never drives that thing. He's afraid 
  it's going to get dented.&quot; Looking at his own white T-Bird, Prince goes 
  on: &quot;He's always been that way. My father gave me this a few years ago. 
  He bought it new in 1966. There were only 22,000 miles on it when I got it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An ignition turns. 
  &quot;Wait,&quot; calls Prince, remembering something. He grabs a tape off the 
  T-Bird seat and yells to his father, &quot;I got something for you to listen 
  to. Lisa [Coleman] and Wendy [Melvoin] have been working on these in L.A.&quot; 
  Prince throws the tape, which the two female members of his band have mixed, 
  and his father catches it with one hand. Nelson nods okay and pulls his car 
  behind his son's in the alley. Closely tailing Prince through North Minneapolis, 
  he waves and smiles whenever we look back. It's impossible to believe that the 
  gun-toting geezer in Purple Rain was modeled after John Nelson. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;That stuff 
  about my dad was part of [director-cowriter] Al Magnoli's story,&quot; Prince 
  explains. &quot;We used parts of my past and present to make the story pop more, 
  but it was a story. My dad wouldn't have nothing to do with guns. He never swore, 
  still doesn't, and never drinks.&quot; Prince looks in his rearview mirror at 
  the car tailing him. &quot;He don't look sixty-nine, do he? He's so cool. He's 
  got girlfriends, lots of 'em.&quot; Prince drives alongside two black kids walking 
  their bikes. &quot;Hey, Prince,&quot; says one casually. &quot;Hey,&quot; says 
  the driver with a nod, &quot;how you doing?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Passing by old 
  neighbors watering their lawns and shooting hoops, the North Side's favorite 
  son talks about his hometown. &quot;I wouldn't move, just cuz I like it here 
  so much. I can go out and not get jumped on. It feels good not to be hassled 
  when I dance, which I do a lot. It's not a think of everybody saying, 'Whoa, 
  who's out with who here?' while photographers flash their bulbs in your face.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nearing the turnoff 
  that leads from Minneapolis to suburban Eden Prairie, Prince flips in another 
  tape and peeks in the rearview mirror. John Nelson is still right behind. &quot;It's 
  real hard for my father to show emotion,&quot; says Prince, heading onto the 
  highway. &quot;He never says, 'I love you,' and when we hug or something, we 
  bang our heads together like in some Charlie Chaplin movie. But a while ago, 
  he was telling me how I always had to be careful. My father told me, 'If anything 
  happens to you, I'm gone.' All I thought at first was that it was a real nice 
  thing to say. But then I thought about it for a while and realized something. 
  That was my father's way of saying 'I love you.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few minutes later, 
  Prince and his father pull in front of the Warehouse, a concrete barn in an 
  Eden Prairie industrial park. Inside, the Family, a rock-funk band that Prince 
  has been working with, is pounding out new songs and dance routines. The group 
  is as tight as ace drummer Jellybean Johnson's pants. At the end of one hot 
  number, Family members fall on their backs, twitching like fried eggs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prince and his 
  father enter to hellos from the still-gyrating band. Prince goes over to a pool 
  table by the soundboard, racks the balls and shimmies to the beat of the Family's 
  next song. Taking everything in, John Nelson gives a professional nod to the 
  band, his son's rack job and his own just-chalked cue. He hitches his shoulders, 
  takes aim and breaks like Minnesota Fats. A few minutes later, the band is still 
  playing and the father is still shooting. Prince, son to this father and father 
  to this band, is smiling.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE NIGHT BEFORE, 
  in the Warehouse, Prince is about to break his three-year public silence. Wearing 
  a jump suit, powder-blue boots and a little crucifix on a chain, he dances with 
  the Family for a little while, plays guitar for a minute, sings lead for a second, 
  then noodles four-handed keyboard with Susannah Melvoin, Wendy's identical-twin 
  sister.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seeing me at the 
  door, Prince comes over. &quot;Hi,&quot; he whispers, offering a hand, &quot;want 
  something to eat or drink?&quot; On the table in front of the band are piles 
  of fruit and a couple bags of Doritos. Six different kinds of tea sit on a shelf 
  by the wall. No drugs, no booze, no coffee. Prince plays another lick or two 
  and watches for a few more minutes, then waves goodbye to the band and heads 
  for his car outside the concrete barn.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm not used 
  to this,&quot; mumbles Prince, staring straight ahead through the windshield 
  of his parked car. &quot;I really thought I'd never do interviews again.&quot; 
  we drive for twenty minutes, talking about Minnesota's skies, air and cops. 
  Gradually, his voice comes up, bringing with it inflections, hand gestures and 
  laughs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soon after driving 
  past a field that will house a state-of-the-art recording studio named Paisley 
  Park, we pull down a quiet suburban street and up to the famous purple house. 
  Prince waves to a lone, unarmed guard in front of a chain-link fence. The unremarkable 
  split-level house, just a few yards back from the minimum security, is quiet. 
  No fountains out front, no swimming pools in back, no black-faced icons of Yahweh 
  or Lucifer. &quot;We're here,&quot; says Prince, grinning. &quot;Come on in.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One look inside 
  tells the undramatic story. Yes, it seems the National Enquirer -- whose Minneapolis 
  expos&eacute; of Prince was excerpted in numerous other newspapers this spring 
  -- was exaggerating. No, the man does not live in an armed fortress with only 
  a food taster and wall-to-wall, life-size murals of Marilyn Monroe to talk to. 
  Indeed, if a real-estate agent led a tour through Prince's house, one would 
  guess that the resident was, at most, a hip suburban surgeon who likes deep-pile 
  carpeting.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hi,&quot; 
  says Rande, from the kitchen, &quot;you got a couple of messages.&quot; Prince 
  thanks her and offers up some homemade chocolate-chip cookies. He takes a drink 
  from a water cooler emblazoned with a Minnesota North Stars sticker and continues 
  the tour. &quot;This place,&quot; he says, &quot;is not a prison. And the only 
  things it's a shrine to are Jesus, love and peace.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Off the kitchen 
  is a living room that holds nothing your aunt wouldn't have in her house. On 
  the mantel are framed pictures of family and friends, including one of John 
  Nelson playing a guitar. There's a color TV and VCR, a long coffee table supporting 
  a dish of jellybeans, and a small silver unicorn by the mantel. Atop the large 
  mahogany piano sits an oversize white Bible.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only unusual 
  thing in either of the two guest bedrooms is a two-foot statue of a smiling 
  yellow gnome covered by a swarm of butterflies. One of the monarchs is flying 
  out of a heart-shaped hole in the gnome's chest. &quot;A friend gave that to 
  me, and I put it in the living room,&quot; says Prince. &quot;But some people 
  said it scared them, so I took it out and put it in here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Downstairs from 
  the living room is a narrow little workroom with recording equipment and a table 
  holding several notebooks. &quot;Here's where I recorded all of 1999,&quot; 
  says Prince, &quot;all right in this room.&quot; On a low table in the corner 
  are three Grammys. &quot;Wendy,&quot; says Prince, &quot;has got the Academy 
  Award.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The work space 
  leads into the master bedroom. It's nice. And...normal. No torture devices or 
  questionable appliances, not even a cigarette butt, beer tab or tea bag in sight. 
  A four-poster bed above plush white carpeting, some framed pictures, one of 
  Marilyn Monroe. A small lounging area off the bedroom provides a stereo, a lake-shore 
  view and a comfortable place to stretch out on the floor and talk. And talk 
  he did -- his first interview in three years.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few hours later, 
  Prince is kneeling in front of the VCR, showing his &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; 
  video. He explains why he started the clip with a prolonged clearing of the 
  throat. &quot;I just did it to be sick, to do something no one else would do.&quot; 
  He pauses and contemplates. &quot;I turned on MTV to see the premiere of 'Raspberry 
  Beret' and Mark Goodman was talking to the guy who discovered the backward message 
  on 'Darling Nikki.' They were trying to figure out what the cough meant too, 
  and it was sort of funny.&quot; He pauses again. &quot;But I'm not getting down 
  on him for trying. I like that. I've always had little hidden messages, and 
  I always will.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He then plugs in 
  a videocassette of &quot;4 the Tears in Your Eyes,&quot; which he's just sent 
  to the Live Aid folks for the big show. &quot;I hope they like it,&quot; he 
  said, shrugging his shoulders.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The phone rings, 
  and Prince picks it up in the kitchen. &quot;We'll be there in twenty minutes,&quot; 
  he says, hanging up. Heading downstairs, Prince swivels his head and smiles. 
  &quot;Just gonna change clothes.&quot; He comes back a couple minutes later 
  wearing another paisley jump suit, &quot;the only kind of clothes I own.&quot; 
  And the boots? &quot;People say I'm wearing heels because I'm short,&quot; he 
  says, laughing. &quot;I wear heels because the women like 'em.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A FEW MINUTES LATER, 
  driving toward the First Avenue club, Prince is talking about the fate of the 
  most famous landmark in Minneapolis. &quot;Before Purple Rain,&quot; he says, 
  &quot;all the kids who came to First Avenue knew us, and it was just like a 
  big, fun fashion show. The kids would dress for themselves and just try to took 
  really cool. Once you got your thing right, you'd stop looking at someone else. 
  You'd be yourself, and you'd feel comfortable.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then Hollywood 
  arrived. &quot;When the film first came out,&quot; Prince remembers, &quot;a 
  lot of tourists started coming. That was kind of weird, to be in the club and 
  get a lot of 'Oh! There he is!' It felt a little strange. I'd be in there thinking, 
  'Wow, this sure is different than it used to be.'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, however, the 
  Gray Line Hip Tour swarm has slackened. According to Prince -- who goes there 
  twice a week to dance when he's not working on a big project -- the old First 
  Avenue feeling is coming back. &quot;There was a lot of us hanging around the 
  club in the old days,&quot; he says, &quot;and the new army, so to speak, is 
  getting ready to come back to Minneapolis. The Family's already here, Mazarati's 
  back now too, and Sheila E. and her band will be coming soon. The club'll be 
  the same thing that it was.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we pull up in 
  front of First Avenue, a Saturday-night crowd is milling around outside, combing 
  their hair, smoking cigarettes, holding hands. They stare with more interest 
  than awe as Prince gets out of the car. &quot;You want to go to the [VIP] booth?&quot; 
  asks the bouncer. &quot;Naah,&quot; says Prince. &quot;I feel like dancing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few feet off 
  the packed dance floor stands the Family, taking a night off from rehearsing. 
  Prince joins the band and laughs, kisses, soul shakes. Prince and three of Family 
  members wade through a floor of Teddy-and-Eleanor-Mondale-brand funkettes and 
  start moving. Many of the kids Prince passes either don't see him or pretend 
  they don't care. Most of the rest turn their heads slightly to see the man go 
  by, then simply continue their own motions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An hour later, 
  he's on the road again, roaring out of downtown. Just as he's asked if there's 
  anything in the world that he wants but doesn't have, two blondes driving daddy's 
  Porsche speed past. &quot;I don't,&quot; Prince says with a giggle, &quot;have 
  them.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He catches up to 
  the girls, rolls down the window and throws a ping-pong ball that was on the 
  floor at them. They turn their heads to see what kind of geek is heaving ping-pong 
  balls at them on the highway at two in the morning. When they see who it is, 
  mouths drop, hands wave, the horn blares. Prince rolls up his window, smiles 
  silently and speeds by.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Off the main highway, 
  Prince veers around the late-night stillness of Cedar Lake, right past the spot 
  where Mary Tyler Moore gamboled during her TV show's credits. This town, he 
  says, is his freedom. &quot;The only time I feel like a prisoner,&quot; he continues, 
  &quot;is when I think too much and can't sleep from just having so many things 
  on my mind. You know, stuff like, 'I could do this, I could do that. I could 
  work with this band. When am I going to do this show or that show?' There's 
  so many things. There's women. Do I have to eat? I wish I didn't have to eat.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few minutes later, 
  he drops me off at my house. Half a block ahead, he stops at a Lake Street red 
  light. A left up lake leads back to late-night Minneapolis; a right is the way 
  home to the suburban purple house and solitude. Prince turns left, back toward 
  the few still burning night lights of the city he's never left.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The Interview<br>
  Why have you decided that now is the time to talk?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>There have 
  been a lot of things said about me, and a lot of them are wrong. There have 
  been a lot of contradictions. I don't mind criticism, I just don't like lies. 
  I feel I've been very honest in my work and my life, and it's hard to tolerate 
  people telling such barefaced lies.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you read most 
  of what's been written about you?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A little, 
  not much. Sometimes someone will pass along a funny one. I just wrote a song 
  called &quot;Hello,&quot; which is going to be on the flip side of &quot;Pop 
  Life.&quot; It says at the end, &quot;Life is cruel enough without cruel words.&quot; 
  I get a lot of cruel words. A lot of people do.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I saw critics 
  be so critical of Stevie Wonder when he made Journey through the Secret World 
  of Plants. Stevie has done so many great songs, and for people to say, &quot;You 
  missed, don't do that, go back&quot; -- well, I would never say, &quot;Stevie 
  Wonder, you missed.&quot; [Prince puts the Wonder album on the turntable, plays 
  a cut, then puts on Miles Davis' new album.] Or Miles. Critics are going to 
  say, &quot;Ah, Miles done went off.&quot; Why say that? Why even tell Miles 
  he went off? You know, if you don't like it, don't talk about it. Go buy another 
  record!</strong></font></p>

  ago I talked too George Clinton, a man who knows and has done so much for funk.

  No, it's no big deal. Hey, I'm afraid of them! One time early in my career, 
  I got into a fight with a New York writer, this real skinny cat, a real sidewinder. 
  He said, &quot;I'll tell you a secret, Prince. Writers write for other writers, 
  and a lot of time it's more fun to be nasty.&quot; I just looked at him. But 
  when I really thought about it and put myself in his shoes, I realized that's 
  what he had to do. I could see his point. They can do whatever they want. And 
  me, too. I can paint whatever picture I want with my albums. And I can try to 
  instill that in every act I've ever worked with.</strong></font></p>

  I've heard some people say that I'm not talking about anything on this record. 
  And what a lot of other people get wrong about the record is that I'm not trying 
  to be this great visionary wizard. Paisley Park is in everybody's heart. It's 
  not just something that I have the keys to. I was trying to say something about 
  looking inside oneself to find perfection. Perfection is in everyone. Nobody's 
  perfect, but they can be. We may never reach that, but it's better to strive 
  than not.</strong></font></p>

  the beginning of the tour, and Wendy is deathly afraid of flying. She got on 
  the plane and really freaked. I was scared for her. I tried to calm her down 
  with jokes, but it didn't work. I thought about it and said, &quot;Do you believe 
  in God?&quot; She said yes. I said, &quot;Do you trust him?&quot; and she said 
  she did. Then I asked, &quot;So why are you afraid to fly?&quot; She started 
  laughing and said, &quot;Okay, okay, okay.&quot; Flying still bothers her a 
  bit, but she knows where it is and she doesn't get freaked.</strong></font></p>

  much so. A while back, I had an experience that changed me and made me feel 
  differently about how and what and how I acted toward people. I'm going to make 
  a film about it -- not the next one, but the one after that. I've wanted to 
  make it for three years now. Don't get me wrong -- I'm still as wild as I was. 
  I'm just funneling it in a different direction. And now I analyze things so 
  much that sometimes I can't shut off my brain and it hurts. That's what the 
  movie will be about.</strong></font></p>

  that changed you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I don't

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What were you depressed 
  about?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A lot had 
  to do with the band's situation, the fact that I couldn't make people in the 
  band understand how great we could all be together if we all played our part. 
  A lot had to do with being in love with someone and not getting any love back. 
  And there was the fact that I didn't talk much with my father and sister. Anyway, 
  a lot of things happened in this two-day period, but I don't want to get into 
  it right now.</strong></font></p>

  it?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>That's 
  what the movie's going to be about. Paisley Park is the only way I can say I 
  got over it now. Paisley Park is the place one should find in oneself, where 
  one can go when one is alone.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say you've 
  now found the place where you can go to be alone. Is it your house? Within the 
  family you've built around yourself? With God?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>It's a 
  combination of things. I think when one discovers himself, he discovers God.

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I don't

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A lot of 
  people think it does, but it doesn't at all. I think the smartest thing I ever 
  did was record Around the World in a Day right after I finished Purple Rain. 
  I didn't wait to see what would happen with Purple Rain. That's why the two 
  albums sound completely different. People think, &quot;Oh, the new album isn't 
  half as powerful as Purple Rain or 1999.&quot; You know how easy it would have 
  been to open Around the World in a Day with the guitar solo that's on the end 
  of &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;? You know how easy it would have been to just 
  put it in a different key? That would have shut everybody up who said an album 
  wasn't half as powerful. I don't want to make an album like the earlier ones. 
  Wouldn't it be cool to be able to put your albums back to back and not get bored, 
  you dig? I don't know how many people can play all their albums back to back 
  with each one going to different cities.</strong></font></p>

  because he's black. That's really the only thing we have in common. He plays 
  different guitar than I do. If they really listened to my stuff, they'd hear 
  more of a Santana influence than Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix played more blues; Santana 
  played prettier. You can't compare people, you really can't, unless someone 
  is blatantly trying to rip somebody off. And you really can't tell that unless 
  you play the songs.</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You've 
  got to understand that there's only so much you can do on an electric guitar.

  Summer Lawns. I respect people's success, but I don't like a lot of popular 
  music. I never did. I like more of the things I heard when I was little. Today, 
  people don't write songs; they're a lot of sounds, a lot of repetition. That 
  happened when producers took over, and that's why there are no more [live] acts. 
  There's no box office anymore. The producers took over, and now no one wants 
  to see these bands. </strong></font></p>

  I don't live in a prison with armed guards around me. The reason I have a guy 
  outside is that after the movie, all kinds of people started coming over and 
  hanging out. That wasn't so bad, but the neighbors got upset that people were 
  driving by blasting their boxes or standing outside and singing. I happen to 
  dig that. That's one reason I'm going to move to more land. There, if people 
  want to come by, it will be fine. Sometimes it gets lonely here. To be perfectly

  I told Susannah [Melvoin] that you were coming over, she said, &quot;Is there 
  something I can do? Do you want me to come by to make it seem like you have 
  friends coming by?&quot; I said no, that would be lying. And she just put her 
  head down, because she knew she doesn't come by to see me as much as she wants 
  to, or as much as she thinks I want her to. It was interesting. See, you did 
  something good, and you didn't even know it.</strong></font></p>

  to ask your friends to come by? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I'm kind 
  of afraid. That's because sometimes everybody in the band comes over, and we 
  have very long talks. They're few and far between, and I do a lot of the talking. 
  Whenever we're done, one of them will come up to me and say, &quot;Take care 
  of yourself. You know I really love you.&quot; I think they love me so much, 
  and I love them so much, that if they came over all the time I wouldn't be able 
  to be to them what I am, and they wouldn't be able to do for me as what they 
  do. I think we all need our individual spaces, and when we come together with 
  what we've concocted in our heads, it's cool.</strong></font></p>

  the idea that I'm a wild sexual person. It can be two o'clock in the afternoon, 
  and someone will make a really strange request from the call box outside. One 
  girl just kept pressing the buzzer. She kept pressing it, and then she started 
  crying. I had no idea why. I thought she might had fallen down. I started talking 
  to her, and she just kept saying, &quot;I can't believe it's you.&quot; I said, 
  &quot;Big deal. I'm no special person. I'm no different than anyone.&quot; She 
  said, &quot;Will you come out?&quot; I said, &quot;Nope, I don't have much on.&quot; 
  And she said, &quot;That's okay.&quot;</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I've lectured 
  quite a few people out there. I'll say, &quot;Think about what you're saying.

  thinks I have a really mean temper and I don't like people to do this or do

  hysterical! He was singing, &quot;I am the world, I am the children!&quot; Then 
  Bruce Springsteen came to the mike, and the boys would push him away. It was 
  hilarious. We put it on when we want to laugh. It was great. Of course, that's 
  not what it is. </strong></font></p>

  if it's done in a proper fashion. It's very easy to say, &quot;Prince, may I 
  take your picture?&quot; I don't know why people can't be more humane about 
  a lot of the things they do. Now when I'm visiting, I like to sneak around and

  will be times when I've been working in the studio for twenty hours and I'll 
  be falling asleep in the chair, but I'll still be able to tell the engineer 
  what cut I want to make. I use engineers in shifts a lot of the time because 
  when I start something, I like to go all the way through. There are very few

  for doing things somebody else wouldn't do. If we are down on the floor doing 
  a step, that's something somebody else wouldn't do. That's what I'm looking 
  for all the time. We don't look for whether something's cool or not, that's 
  not what time it is. It's not just wanting to be out. It's just if I do something 
  that I think belongs to someone else or sounds like someone else, I do something 
  else. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why did Morris 
  say such negative things about you after he left the band? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>People 
  who leave usually do so out of a need to express something they can't do here. 
  It's really that simple. Morris, for example, always wanted to be a solo act, 
  period. But when you're broke and selling shoes someplace, you don't think about 
  asking such a thing. Now, I think Morris is trying to create his own identity. 
  One of the ways of doing that is trying to pretend that you don't have a past.

<p><strong><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jesse [Johnson, 
  former guitarist for the Time] is the only one who went away who told what happened, 
  what really went down with the band. He said there was friction, because he 
  was in a situation that didn't quite suit him. Jesse wanted to be in front all 
  the time. And I just don't think God puts everybody in that particular bag. 
  And sometimes I was blunt enough to say that to people: &quot;I don't think 
  you should be in the frontman. I think Morris should.&quot; </font></strong></p>

  the keyboard player]. He's more or less a technician. He can read and write 
  like a whiz, and is one of the fastest in the world. And Wendy makes me seem 
  all right in the eyes of people Watching. </font></strong></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How so? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>She keeps 
  a smile on her face. When I sneer, she smiles. It's not premeditated, she just 
  does it. It's a good contrast. Lisa is like my sister. She'll play what the 
  average person won't. She'll press two notes with one finger so the chord is 
  a lot larger, things like that. She's more abstract. She's into Joni Mitchell, 
  too. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What about the 
  other bands? Apollonia, Vanity, Mazarati, the Family? What are you trying to 
  express through them? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A lot has 
  to do with them. They come to me with an idea, and I try to bring that forth. 
  I don't give them anything. I don't say, &quot;Okay, you're going to do this, 
  and you're going to do that.&quot; I mean, it was Morris' idea to be as sick 
  as he was. That was his personality. We both like Don King and get a lot of 
  stuff off him. </strong> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Because 
  he's outrageous and thinks everything's so exciting --even when it isn't. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People think you 
  control those bands, that it's similar to Rick James, relationship with the 
  Mary Jane Girls. A lot of people think he's turning all the knobs. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I don't 
  know their situation. But you look at Sheila E. performing, and you can just 
  tell she's holding her own. The same goes for the Family. You and I were playing 
  Ping-Pong, and they were doing just fine. </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After all these 
  years, does the music give you as much of a rush as it used to? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I increases 
  more and more. One of my friends worries that I'll short-circuit. We always 
  say I'll make the final fade on a song one time and [Laughs, dropping his head 
  in a dead slump]. It just gets more and more interesting every day. More than 
  anything else, I try not to repeat myself. It's the hardest thing in the world 
  to do -- there's only so many notes one human being can muster. I write a lot 
  more than people think I do, and I try not to copy that. </strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think 
  that's the problem with the music industry today. When a person does get a hit, 
  they try to do it again the same way. I don't think I've ever done that. I write 
  all the time and cut all the time. I want to show you the archives, where all 
  my old stuff is. There's tons of music I've recorded there. I have the follow-up 
  album to 1999. I could put it all together and play it for you, and you would 
  go &quot;Yeah!&quot; And I could put it out, and it would probably sell what 
  1999 did. But I always try to do something different and conquer new ground.

<p><strong><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In people's 
  minds, it all boils down to &quot;Is Prince getting too big for his breeches?&quot; 
  I wish people would understand that I always thought I was bad. I wouldn't have 
  got into the business if I didn't think I was bad.</font></strong></p>
