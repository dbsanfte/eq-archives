  little girls understand? </strong><br>
  By Bill Adler</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Snaking out from 
  the wings toward center stage at the Ritz, prancing like a pony with his hands 
  on his hips and then flinging a clorine kick with a coquettish toss of his head, 
  Prince is androgyny personified. Slender and doe-eyed, with a faint pubescent 
  mustache, he is bare-chested beneath a gray, hip-length Edwardian jacket. There's 
  a raffish red scarf at this neck, and he's wearing tight black bikini briefs, 
  thigh-high black leg-warmers and black-fringed go-go boots. With his racially 
  and sexually mixed five-piece band churning out the terse rhythms of &quot;Sexy 
  Dancer&quot; behind him, the effect is at once truly sexy and more than a little 
  disorienting , and his breathy falsetto only adds to his ambiguity -- for sheer 
  girlish vulnerability, there's no one around to touch him: not Michael Jackson, 
  not even fourteen-year-old soul songbird Stacy Lattisaw. At age twenty, Prince 
  may be the unlikeliest rock star, black or white, in recent memory -- but a 
  star he definitely is. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As quickly becomes 
  apparent, Prince's lyrics bear little relation to standard AM radio floss. In 
  addition to bald sexual come-ons and twisted love plaints, he champions the 
  need for independence and self-expression. And one song, &quot;Uptown,&quot; 
  is, among other things, an antiwar chant. Further complicating the proceedings 
  are the heavy-metal moans Prince wrenches out of his guitar and the punchy dance-rock 
  rhythms of his band (bassist Andre Cymone, guitarist Dez Dickerson, keyboardists 
  Lisa Coleman and Dr. Fink and drummer Bobby Z.), all of whom are longtime cohorts 
  from Prince's hometown -- Minneapolis, of all places.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I grew up 
  on the borderline,&quot; Prince says after the show. &quot;I had a bunch of 
  white friends, and I had a bunch of black friends. I never grew up in any one 
  particular culture.&quot; The son of a half-black father and an Italian mother 
  who divorced when he was seven, Prince pretty much raised himself from the age 
  of twelve, when he formed his first band. Oddly, he claims that the normalcy 
  and remoteness of Minneapolis provided just artistic nourishment he needed. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We basically 
  got all the new music and dances three months late, so I just decided that I 
  was gonna do my own thing. Otherwise, when we did split Minneapolis, we were 
  gonna be way behind and dated. The white radio stations were mostly country, 
  and the one black radio station was really boring to me. For that matter, I 
  didn't really have a record player when I was growing up, and I never got a 
  chance to check out Hendrix and the rest of them because they were dead by the 
  time I was really getting serious. I didn't even start playing guitar until 
  1974.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With his taste 
  for outlandish clothes and his &quot;lunatic&quot; friends, Prince says he &quot;took 
  a lot of heat all the time. People would say something about our clothes or 
  the way we looked or who we were with, and we'd end up fighting. I was a very 
  good fighter,&quot; he says with a soft, shy laugh. &quot;I never lost. I don't 
  know if I fight fair, but I go for it. That's what 'Uptown' is about -- we do 
  whatever we want, and those who cannot deal with it have a problem within themselves.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prince has written, 
  arranged, performed and produced three albums to date (For You, Prince and Dirty 
  Mind), all presenting the same unique persona. Appearances to the contrary, 
  though, he says he's not gay, and he has a standard rebuff for overenthusiastic 
  male fans: &quot;I'm not about that; we can be friends, but that's as far as 
  it goes. My sexual preferences really aren't any of their business.&quot; A 
  Penthouse &quot;Pet of the Month&quot; centerfold laid out on a nearby table 
  silently underscores his point. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It took Prince 
  six months alone in the studio to concoct his 1978 debut album, because, he 
  says, &quot;I was younger then.&quot; Prince required six weeks. He controlled 
  the making of both records, but notes that they were &quot;overseen&quot; by 
  record company and management representatives. Dirty Mind, however, was made 
  in isolation in Minneapolis. &quot;Nobody knew what was going on, and I became 
  totally engulfed in it,&quot; he says. &quot;It really felt like me for once.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The result of this 
  increased freedom was a collection of songs celebrating incest (&quot;Sister&quot;) 
  and oral sex (&quot;Head&quot;) in language raw enough to merit a warning sticker 
  on the album's cover. &quot;When I brought it to the record company it shocked 
  a lot of people,&quot; he says. &quot;But they didn't ask me to go back and 
  change anything, and I'm real grateful. Anyway, I wasn't being deliberately 
  provocative. I was being deliberately me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obviously, judging 
  by the polished eclecticism of Dirty Mind, being himself is the best course. 
  &quot;I ran away from home when I was twelve,&quot; Prince says. &quot;I've 
  changed address in Minneapolis thirty-two times, and there was a great deal 
  of loneliness. But when I think about it, I know I'm here for a purpose, and 
  I don't worry about it so much.&quot;</font></p>
