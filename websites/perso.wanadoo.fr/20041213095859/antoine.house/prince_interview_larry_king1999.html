<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Artist Formerly 
  Known as Prince Discusses His Latest Album, &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;<br>
  Aired December 10, 1999 - 9:00 p.m. ET <br>
  THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE 
  UPDATED. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LARRY KING, HOST: 
  Tonight, he's rocked, he's shocked, he's been telling us to party like it's 
  1999 for 17 years, the artist formerly known as Prince is our guest, a music 
  world original, next on LARRY KING LIVE. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We're back in New 
  York tonight. Never know where we are. This is our millennium month on LARRY 
  KING LIVE. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">//</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's a great pleasure 
  to have with us tonight the artist formerly known as Prince. His first album 
  in three years has just been released. It's called &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic.&quot; 
  There you see the cover of the CD. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And for the artist, 
  the obvious first question is, why three years? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST FORMERLY 
  KNOWN AS PRINCE: Well, there's three things I wanted to get out of my system, 
  mainly &quot;The Crystal Ball Project,&quot; which was a reissue of a lot of 
  the bootlegs that have been coming out all over the world. I am probably one 
  of the most bootlegged artists out there. I wanted to clean that up and get 
  the real good mixes out, let people hear what they're really supposed to sound 
  like if ever given the chance to complete them. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So that's 
  the reason for this space of time? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  We did a couple of other projects. I was working with Chaka Khan. I did an album 
  with her, Larry Graham. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: She's terrific. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  she is. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What can 
  an artist do about bootlegging? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: What 
  -- the best thing you can do is go back and get those mixes again and fix them 
  up the way you always saw them completed, and then, you know, reissue them. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Does the 
  listener know if they buy one of these in Germany that this isn't what you intended? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: A lot 
  of my so-called fans do, and they actually thrive off the fact that it's stolen 
  property, you know. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You are -- 
  you would admit to yourself, an unusual personality? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: It 
  depends. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Well, let's 
  say you're different. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: As 
  compared to what? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: As compared 
  to most people in, let's say, show business, you're an unusual person. Most 
  people don't get famous with one name and then change it, right, would you say? 
  What's the story on that, by the way? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  I had to search deep within my heart and spirit, and I wanted to make a change 
  and move to a new plateau in my life. And one of the ways in which I did that 
  was to change my name. It sort of divorced me from the past and all the hangups 
  that go along with it. I was -- as it's been well chronicled in deep dispute 
  with my record label... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Which is 
  Warner Bros., right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Which owns 
  this network, I might add, just to throw... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  they do? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: They 
  -- we had some issues that were basically about ownership of the music and how 
  often I was supposed to record and things like that. We got along otherwise. 
  We just had came to a head in those types of... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So there 
  was no clash over what you would record or what kind of music you were singing, 
  et cetera? None of that? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  no creative issues whatsoever. And they were gracious enough to allow me a very 
  wide palate to, you know, put colors onto. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: About the 
  highest risk one would think someone who gets famous would take is to drop the 
  name that got them famous. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  that was one of the things that I dealt with, is that I really searched deep 
  within to find out the answer to whether fame was most important to me or my 
  spiritual well being, and I chose the latter. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Was it difficult 
  to not be what you had become known as? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: You 
  mean... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: I think -- 
  well, let's say -- the only other famous person I know who did this was Cassius 
  Clay. He's a dear friend, and he changed his name to Muhammad Ali as heavyweight 
  champion of the world. That was incredible to change your name. That was due 
  to a faith belief. But he wasn't selling records. He was in the ring, as long 
  as he won, it sold. You, though, a person in show business, is almost dependent 
  on recognition. You stopped being Prince. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  I -- that's a good point. I pretty much wanted to be dependent upon God. And 
  when you get the inner calling to do something and you know that you're being 
  inspired by God, you pretty much know you'd better answer that call or suffer 
  the consequences. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you think 
  this was God inspired as well? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I do 
  believe, yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Why, then, 
  did you choose &quot;the artist formerly known as?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well 
  I didn't choose that. That was... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: ... chosen 
  for you. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  pretty much. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What would 
  you have chosen? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I... 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: I mean, did 
  you think of a name? What is your name at birth? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: My 
  name at birth was Prince Rogers Nelson. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So did you 
  think of Nelson? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Rogers? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Were you 
  thinking of a name? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  it didn't come to me like that. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So how did 
  &quot;the artist formerly known as&quot; come about? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: That 
  came up through people's problem with -- mainly the media's problem with not 
  having a pronunciation for the symbol. So they had to come up with something 
  I guess. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So &quot;the 
  artist formerly known as&quot; is a media invention. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Not your 
  invention? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  sir. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You're a 
  symbol. OK, how do you promote a symbol? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  what we found is throughout the world, if you hold this up and show it to people, 
  what they think of, they will say, Prince. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Obviously. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So you obviously 
  made it famous. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  I think so, yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Can you tell 
  us what it signifies? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  me. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: No, but I 
  mean, how you chose it. You designed it? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: It's 
  sort of come about over time. I've always morphed the female and the male symbol 
  together. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Show me again. 
  Let me see it. Yes, and it works. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: It's 
  pretty cool. It makes for great jewelry, too. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Has it been 
  copied? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Stores sell 
  this everywhere? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  a lot of times, you'll find, like I say, so- called fans on the Internet, which 
  is kind of a problem sometimes because once they use the symbol, it's as though 
  I've endorsed whatever it is that they have for sale, and... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Can you copyright 
  that? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: It 
  is copyrighted. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So you can't 
  be ripped off by it? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: We've been 
  showing it on the bottom of the screen, so that people tune in, they know who 
  we're watching here. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Cool.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> KING: There it 
  is. Look at that. See that? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: All 
  right. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: That's cool, 
  right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: That's 
  a class act. This is a... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Hey, this 
  is CNN, man. We don't fool around. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'll be right 
  back with the artist formerly known as Prince. We're going to talk about his 
  album, his extraordinary life. We'll be taking your phone calls as well. He's 
  got a concert coming up. And the album &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot; 
  is now out. Don't bootleg it -- buy it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'll be right 
  back. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">//</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: We're back 
  with the artist. And the new album is &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic.&quot; 
  And he now calls himself &quot;the artist.&quot; In print, however, it is just 
  a symbol. We gave him the name. He -- one traces early life an incredible story. 
  But you live in Spain, right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I like 
  to say that I live in the world but I am not of it. I travel a lot. I call Spain 
  home now. I also have a home in Minnesota. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Still in 
  Minnesota? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Roots? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Why Spain? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I -- 
  what I found that I like most is from 2:00 to 5:00, everything just shuts down. 
  So... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Siesta -- 
  Fiesta -- siesta. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  And everybody just chills and they take a moment just to gather their senses. 
  I think, you know, we probably need to do that here in America sometimes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Let's -- 
  so in other words, at 2:00 every afternoon you stop doing whatever you're doing? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  there's no stores and shopping and things like that. All that shuts down and 
  just allows everybody a chance to just regroup and, you know, think about life. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you still 
  have a fondness for Minneapolis? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  yes, absolutely. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What was 
  it like growing up there? Aren't many blacks in Minneapolis, right? I was talking 
  to Dave Winfield the other night, one percent maybe. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  it was interesting for me because I grew up getting a wider array of music. 
  I grew up with Santana and Larry Graham and Fleetwood Mac, all kinds of different 
  things, you know? So that was -- that was very cool. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Good place 
  to grow up? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  sir. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You had a 
  rough childhood, didn't you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: In 
  some respects. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Did that 
  affect your music? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I don't 
  think so, no. I -- I think it probably helped me to look inside to know that 
  I had to do for self, you know? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You had a 
  rough time with parents -- I mean, that's all resolved now, but your father 
  -- you had a rough time with your father, right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I wouldn't 
  call it &quot;rough.&quot; I mean, he was a very strict disciplinarian, but 
  all fathers were. I learned the difference between right and wrong, so I don't 
  -- I don't consider it so rough. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Would you 
  look back and say you're glad he was that way? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  you know, as I go through this journey, I don't look back much at all. I try 
  to stay in the now and live in the now. I think it keeps you young. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So you're 
  not a reminiscencer? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: When did 
  you... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Is 
  that a word, Larry? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: No, I invented 
  it. Maybe it's my new symbol -- inventing words. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: It's 
  hipper, brother, so I know. I like to learn, but you know... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: When -- good 
  -- good point. When did you decide music would be a career? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  I -- I learned early on this was what I wanted to do, maybe about 12 years old 
  I knew that this is what I would want to do the rest of my life, yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You knew 
  it then? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: And how -- 
  what burst you on the scene? How did the world get to know Prince, the then 
  Prince? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well 
  -- by the way, I'm still Prince. I just use a different sound for my name, which 
  is none. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: But it's 
  hard not to refer to you. It's hard to call you uh. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: It's 
  cool. It's cool. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You're understanding 
  of this plight we're faced with. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  yes, no problem. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Thank you. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: What 
  was the question? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: The question 
  was -- good, you threw me. I forgot the question. The question -- what was the 
  question? I just asked a question. I forgot the question. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: You 
  were saying how much you love live television. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Yes. That 
  wasn't the question, though. No, the question was, how did you get famous? How 
  did you -- how did the world get to know you? What happened? Was it a record, 
  an appearance, something? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  it started with a lot of appearances I was doing in and about Minneapolis. And 
  word just spread about... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So you were 
  a local man? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes 
  -- what I could do. And then I was taken out to Los Angeles by my first manager, 
  whose name escapes me. And other people started getting to see what I could 
  do. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: And then 
  did you have a hit record? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  we were just talking about making one right at that point. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: And what 
  burst it for you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Hmm? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What did 
  it for you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: The 
  song? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: The 
  song was called &quot;Soft and Wet.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: And that... 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: That 
  was the first. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: ... immediately 
  became a hit, and you were known? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Quietly, 
  but a lot of people knew about me because I was -- I used Stevie Wonder as an 
  inspiration, whom I look up to a great deal just for the way that he crafted 
  music and his connection to the spirit. And, boy, back then I used him as a 
  role model in trying to play all the instruments and be very self-contained 
  and keep my vision clear. So word spread very quickly about what I could do. 
  A lot of people knew about it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: How would 
  you describe your music? What idiom would you put it in? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: The 
  only thing I could think of, because I really don't like categories, but the 
  only thing I could think of is inspirational. And I think music that is from 
  the heart falls right into that category, people who really feel what it is 
  that they're doing. And ultimately all music is or can be inspirational. And 
  it's -- that's why it's so important to let your gift be guided by something 
  more clear, you know? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: The thing 
  is, we don't know -- you think you know where that gift comes from? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  yes, absolutely. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: We're going 
  to talk about that in a minute. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We're going to 
  see as we break -- here's a portion of a video from that brand-new album &quot;Rave 
  Un2 the Joy Fantastic.&quot; </font></p>

  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: By the way, 
  all of those things that you just saw, the -- the videos they do you do in your 
  own studio in Minneapolis? THE ARTIST: A good portion of them. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So we don't 
  think of L.A., Nashville, all these hotspot New York places. Minneapolis gets 
  it done, too. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Minneapolis 
  has always been the bomb. You don't have to go outside of that. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Where does 
  your inspiration come from? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I like 
  to believe that my inspiration comes from God and that... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Did you always 
  believe that? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  As you grow older, you learn and you start to -- you get smarter, yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Because you 
  were once kind of raucous, right? Right? I mean, you would say you were, well, 
  not anti-spiritual. You certainly would not think of you as a great believing 
  soul. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well... 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: True or not? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I don't 
  believe that to be true. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Always were? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I have 
  always known that God was my creator and that without him, boy, nothing works. 
  It works to a point, and then it just kind of deteriorates. Entropy takes place. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: When bad 
  things have happened to you, do you blame him? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Absolutely 
  not, no. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: How do you 
  explain -- how do you resolve it in yourself? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I learn 
  from it. And I don't wallow in it. I don't spend time in a place. I let myself 
  move on, you know? Right today, I could sit and say, I have animosity towards... 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: ... a record 
  company. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  a company that owns the rights to my work, you know. They're businessmen. They're 
  doing what it is that makes their business successful, and I also am allowed 
  to do things that make my business successful. And for me, that would be to 
  own my work. So I just chose to step away from that. And knowing that, I sent 
  a nice letter to the president -- then-president because they changed a lot 
  weekly during that time, and I told him that I loved him, and that, you know, 
  I was glad that I had this experience, you know. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So you would 
  say, even though we don't like to look back, that dispute turns out now to be 
  an experience that worked for you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well 
  , I think my understanding of it is what worked for me. I don't consider it 
  proper that my creations belong to someone else. I can go up to a little kid 
  on the street and say, do you know that I don't own &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; 
  and they're appalled by that. So my understanding of it is what pretty much... 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you still 
  not own &quot;Purple Rain?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  I'll have to rerecord it to own a new master copy of the -- we've done that 
  with the song &quot;1999.&quot; There is a new master recording of it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: I want to 
  ask you about that and how you looked ahead when &quot;1999&quot; came out in 
  the early '80s. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'll be right 
  back with the artist formerly known as Prince. We'll be including your phone

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: I know you're 
  going to do a pay-per-view special the year 2000. It's going to air New Year's, 
  and you say that's the last time you're ever going to play &quot;1999,&quot; 
  right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  sir. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Tell me the 
  origin of that. How -- what were you thinking in 1980 -- what was it -- '2? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: 1982 
  I wrote that. We were sitting around watching a special about &quot;1999,&quot; 
  and a lot of people were talking about the year and speculating on what was 
  going to happen. And I just found it real ironic how everyone that was around 
  me whom I thought to be very optimistic people were dreading those days, and 
  I always knew I'd be cool. I never felt like this was going to be a rough time 
  for me. I knew that there were going to be rough times for the Earth because 
  of this system is based in entropy, and it's pretty much headed in a certain 
  direction. So I just wanted to write something that gave hope, and what I find 
  is people listen to it. And no matter where we are in the world, I always get 
  the same type of response from them. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Dick Clark 
  just rated it one of the 10 greatest songs of the millennium. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Great records 
  of the millennium. Did you have any idea it would be as, one, prophetic as it 
  was and as successful as it was? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Not 
  to sound arrogant, but there was a point during rehearsal, we were working on 
  it, and the song was going to be sung in a three-part harmony like Sly and The 
  Family Stone's song, and I -- we all got together, and we started singing it 
  and it wasn't really working, so what we did is I said, all right, you sing 
  your harmony for the first part, then you sing your harmony for the second part, 
  and I'll sing my harmony for the third. And it broke. When that breakup happened 
  like that and everybody got their part separated, then I knew we had something 
  real special. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Are you surprised 
  at how long it has been around? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  I've been around for a while, so. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: But I mean, 
  now 1999 is here. Were you right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  when you listen to the music, there are a lot of people running around kind 
  of Y2K-ing it, and we just kind of chilling and studying... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Are you worried 
  about Y2K? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  sir. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Not at all? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No.

  is going to go wrong -- you'll fly? </font></p>

  worry about too much anyway. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You don't?

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Did you ever? 
  When you had disputes, arguments with record companies, taking a stand, were 
  you a worrier? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  I think once I started writing &quot;slave&quot; on my face, I pretty much knew 
  the outcome. I mean, you have to understand that that word on one's face pretty 
  much changes the dynamic of any meeting that you're in when they see it. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: How did people 
  react to you when they did see it? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  the record company didn't really say too much. They just kind of -- all right, 
  what's the business at hand today, you know, and that was it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CALLER: Good. </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
  have been a friend since '78. My favorite cut on the &quot;Rave&quot; album 
  is &quot;So Far So Pleased,&quot; and I wanted to know what inspired you to 
  add this to &quot;Rave&quot; because it seems like it's really different from 
  the rest of the cut, so I just want to know. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I think 
  my love of rock music and living in Minneapolis, I am always going to have my 
  guitar in the mix somewhere. And my -- the chance that I got to work with Gwen 
  Stefani, I wanted something that she sounded really cool on so I put that on 
  there. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Has a lot 
  of music affected you, like do you like jazz music? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  yes, sir, Miles Davis I learned a lot from. I learned a lot about space from 
  Miles. Space is a sound too, and it can be used very inventively if... </font></p>

  technically a great player, was he not? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: So 
  they say, yes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: The &quot;Purple 
  Rain&quot; concept, autobiographical? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Semi, 
  yes. Albert Magnoli wrote that, the script for that. My whole thing was to -- 
  I really wanted to chronicle the life I was living at the time, which was in 
  a area that had a lot of great talent and a lot of rivalries. The time -- and 
  I forgot to mention, they will be on the pay-per-view special. You have got 
  to see them now, they're crazy. So I wanted to chronicle that vibe of my life.

  surprised at its success? (UNINTELLIGIBLE) maybe you weren't, maybe you knew 
  you had something. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  you know, you can kind of get a feel. There was no movie out like that at the 
  time. That's what I tend to do in all the things that I do is, you know, the 
  idea with art and inspiration is to try to let it grow and move forward. If 
  there's stagnation, you can always come with something and cut through the maze.

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CALLER: Since you 
  have been called Prince, and the artist formerly known as, and the artist, and 
  the symbol. And I can't help but wonder, what do your friends call you? What 
  do your closest friends call you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Good question 
  -- meet you on the street, OK, what do they say? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: OK, 
  Larry calls me baby brother, Mayte calls me honey. Let's see, my enemies call 
  me squiggle, and, you know, all kinds of crazy. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What do you 
  call your -- let's say you call me. Hello? What do you say? This is who? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I don't 
  say that too much. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What would 
  you say? You must make some -- do you ever call anyone? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Very 
  seldom, I don't like telephones. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You don't?

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So it's rare 
  that you hit a button and dial a number? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Usually, 
  the people that I call are people that are -- that I'm close to, and they know 
  my voice. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What does 
  Mayte call you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Honey 
  -- she never really calls me Prince. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: She never 
  -- even when you were Prince? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  she never... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: There she 
  is. How is she doing? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  perfect. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: She is in 
  Spain? THE ARTIST: No, she's in Miami now. She's visiting her mother. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So on the 
  &quot;Purple Rain&quot; thing, you could say you expected it? Not surprised 
  that it went as well as it did? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I expected 
  it because, I think, because there was, like I said, there was nothing out like 
  it at the time -- and if only for Morris Day's performance. I thought he was 
  incredible in it. And the music -- we were at a very good place musically. </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Right 
  today I feel like I could put together something equally as interesting, and 
  it would be as successful if the right people are getting paid. You know, that 
  may sound strange, but this is a business, and when people are involved in it, 
  you have successes, you know? And I understand that, and I knew there would 
  be times where records wouldn't sell as much when I got away from those particular 
  people, but I was cool with that because success pretty much is what you make 
  it to be. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So you're 
  saying, then, you do need the suits, so to speak? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: It 
  depends on what you gauge success to be. I... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What do you? 
  Is financial your gauge word? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  not so much because once I do the music, it's a success there. I mean, that's 
  it for me. Now, on the selling tip, for example, if an album goes down the chart, 
  that isn't something I can control. I just did the music, you know? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: But you want 
  people to tune in New Year's Eve. You would like to have a lot of people call 
  In Demand and order to see you. You're want -- you are an artist, you want to 
  be seen. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  but if it's an auditing situation where I don't know how many people are actually 
  tuning in, it's not something I can control. They can actually say anything 
  to me, right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Correct. 
  And you go -- you have to go -- trust? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  that's why contracts don't work. They're not based in trust. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you therefore 
  -- have you lost, even as a spiritual person, lost trust in people? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  no, no. I have lost trust in contracts. I don't believe in contracts. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you have 
  a contract for the pay-per-view night? Or a shaking hand, or... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I'm 
  not certain. I can go check, but... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: But you're 
  not into them? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I'm 
  not into them, really. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Our guest 
  is the artist. We'll be back with more phone calls at the end of the program. 
  We'll are going to meet the great bassist Larry Graham as well. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yay, 
  yay. Sorry. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: &quot;The&quot; 
  is applauding. We -- he never calls anybody, weird though. Hello? No one's there. 
  </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'll be 
  right back with more phone calls. If we take two or three more, we'll break 
  a record here. Don't go away. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">//</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: A lot of 
  people were telling me today -- I was just telling the artist -- that, boy, 
  you're going to have the artist on for an hour? it's going to be very hard because 
  he's very hard to talk to. Now you're not hard to talk to. Where did this reputation 
  begin that you are difficult, do you think? I imagine you're not hearing it 
  here for the first time. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Probably 
  where all reputations begin. I think the media plays a big part in one's perception 
  of me. Until one actually sits down and talks to me they can't really know me. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Well, should 
  you have been more public? Should you have done more of things like this? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  I kind of did what I wanted to do. I wanted my music, as even now, to speak 
  loudest for me. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: But you -- 
  you're not uncomfortable here, are you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No, 
  not at all. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: But the reputation 
  is that you would be. How do you fight that other than by counteracting it? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  I -- I'm not -- I don't think in terms of fighting. I'm not -- I don't think 
  that you win anything by fighting. I'm the type of person that likes to look 
  at things for exactly the way they are. And... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you get 
  angry? You're a perfectionist musically, right? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You must 
  get angry then? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I use 
  my anger with humor. I have a way of being very stern, but I always find the 
  irony in it, and I always make it funny. I make it funny for myself and the 
  person that I'm... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So the person 
  you're directing it at is not humbled or made to feel less than a human. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  no one can make you feel anything. You pretty much are going to fall in there 
  if you, you know, aren't spiritually based. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: How do you 
  handle that aspect of the media which has often given you trouble, the tabloids? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I don't 
  have trouble with anybody. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You don't? 
  Do you read them? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you hear 
  about them? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Very 
  seldom. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Do you think 
  any part of a personality's private life is our business? Do you think your 
  marriage is our business? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Well, 
  you know, I'm like this. My music is my music. That's pretty much what you come 
  to the party for. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Naturally. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: If 
  I give you something else, that's me giving you something else. If you seek 
  something else, then there's something inside of you that's lacking, I would 
  think. So I think that personal actually means personal. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: But do you 
  wonder why the public wants to know? Don't wonder? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Are you interested 
  in the personal lives of other people? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Let's 
  see, Michael Jordan? Let's see, who... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Yes, are 
  you interested in -- Michael Jordan, you're a big fan of Michael Jordan. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Big 
  fan of Michael Jordan. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Are you interested 
  in how his marriage goes? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: No. Interested 
  in how he gets along with his children? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: No. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: You know 
  what... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I'm 
  just interested in how he gets along with that rim. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Well said.

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Don't forget, 
  New Year's Eve special with the artist on pay-per-view. Before we take a break 
  and meet Larry Graham, let's take another call. Houston, hello. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CALLER: Hi, pleasure 
  to talk to you, sir. I've always known you to be -- I've always known you to 
  be a spiritual and God-loving person, and I've always respected that and your 
  music. And I've known that you've always thanked God on every one of your CDs, 
  and that has inspired me all of my life. I love God myself. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: I can't -- 
  we lost that. What? Oh, I'm sorry. We lost the call. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I can 
  finish it for her. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: What was 
  your earliest inspiration, she asked. That was... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I was 
  discussing this with Larry today, and we were just discussing the word &quot;inspiration&quot; 
  and where we think it originated from. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: And? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: And 
  ultimately, you know, if you go back, your father may inspire you, and then 
  your father, his father inspired him, and his father may have inspired him. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: So eventually 
  we get to Adam. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes, 
  eventually. Adam had a father. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Ah. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Yes. 
  Inspiration comes from God. That's the original source. And so to use your gift 
  in a creative fashion, that's the best thing you can do. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: We're going 
  to take a break and come back, and we'll be joined to finish the program by 
  one of the great bassists of all time. He now is the bassist with the artist 
  -- the great Larry Graham will join us right after this. </font></p>

  that concert will be his bassist, the great Larry Graham. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How did you hook 
  up with this? Why are you part of &quot;the&quot; concert? </font></p>

  would -- what do you want to be called? </font></p>

  up with him? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(CROSSTALK) </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LARRY GRAHAM, BASSIST: 
  Well actually, just let me say something right quick before we get into that. 
  Thank you for having me on the show. And I have watched many of your shows, 
  and I think you're a great person. The pictures you just showed me of your little 
  baby just blew me away. Congratulation on that. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Little Chance 
  -- you like him, too? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: Oh, yes. 
  But thanks for having me here. I've watched many of your shows. I think you're 
  wonderful, and I thought about what am I going to wear? So I think I'll let 
  Larry King inspire my attire. This is my Larry King look. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: The King 
  look. Well, we're close on time, so tell me how you got together. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: We were 
  in Nashville, and I was playing a concert at the smaller venue and baby brother 
  was playing a concert at the larger venue, and he found out I was there, called 
  me, and said, hey, we're going to have a jam session tonight after the show, 
  would you like to come? And so I went, and we walked into the club. And my wife 
  reached in her purse and pulled out my fuzz peddle and my chords... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: There's 
  love. That's love. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: ... and 
  hooked me up. And that was the first time we got a chance to play together. 
  And that night, we said everything that we never got a chance to say to each 
  other over the years. We talked through our music. And when that night was finished, 
  I knew so much more about him and he knew so much more about me, and we connected 
  from then on. And after that, you know, he said, well, I am going to be going 
  on tour, would you join me? And we did one show, then another show, then another 
  show. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: How important 
  is the bass? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Oh, 
  man, the bass is -- that's it. It's b-a-s-e not b-a-s-s. That's a fish. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Good point. 
  How good is he? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: That's 
  -- man, he's taught me so much about respecting one another, musicians listening 
  to one another, and just the sound of his bass is -- it's undeniable. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: How good 
  -- you're putting your jacket on, you're cold, huh? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: Yes, it's 
  cold. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: We might 
  tell the audience. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: Yes, it's 
  freezing in here. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: This is above 
  and beyond -- it's purple heart night. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: And don't 
  want my voice to start shaking and (UNINTELLIGIBLE) think I'm nervous. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: We're almost 
  out of time. How great is he? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: Well I'll 
  tell you this, the greatest musician that I have worked with. because I've worked 
  with other musicians that were great, but they didn't allow me to really have 
  the freedom that I needed to be able to give them all that I could give them. 
  With baby brother, he allows me the freedom to give all that I can give, and 
  as a result, what we're doing now, when you hear it, you can see that it's coming 
  from the heart, which is why we're touching hearts. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Unselfish. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: Totally 
  unselfish. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KING: Great pleasure 
  meeting you. </font></p>

  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ARTIST: I'm 
  honored, and wait -- let me show this ring to folks. Put the ring up there. 
  Look at that ring. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GRAHAM: It says 
  &quot;Graham.&quot; That's in case I forget my name. </font></p>

  are diamonds. </font><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And
