  <strong>Nelson Finds It &quot;Hard To Become Known&quot; </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;I play with Grand Central Corporation. I've been playing with them for 
  two years,&quot; Prince Nelson, senior at Central, said. Prince started playing 
  piano at age seven and guitar when he got out of eighth grade.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince was born in Minneapolis. When asked, he said, &quot;I was born here, 
  unfortunately.&quot; Why? &quot;I think it is very hard for a band to make it 
  in this state, even if they're good. Mainly because there aren't any big record 
  companies or studios in this state. I really feel that if we would have lived 
  in Los Angeles or New York or some other big city, we would have gotten over 
  by now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  He likes Central a great deal, because his music teachers let him work on his 
  own. He now is working with Mr. Bickham, a music teacher at Central, but has 
  been working with Mrs. Doepkes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  He plays several instruments, such as guitar, bass, all keyboards, and drums. 
  He also sings sometimes, which he picked up recently. He played saxophone in 
  seventh grade but gave it up. He regrets he did. He quit playing sax when school 
  ended one summer. He never had time to practice sax anymore when he went back 
  to school. He does not play in the school band. Why? &quot;I really don't have 
  time to make the concerts.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince has a brother that goes to Central whose name is Duane Nelson, who is 
  more athletically enthusiastic. He plays on the basketball team and played on 
  the football team. Duane is also a senior.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince plays by ear. &quot;I've had about two lessons, but they didn't help 
  much. I think you'll always be able to do what your ear tells you, so just think 
  how great you'd be with lessons also,&quot; he said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;I advise anyone who wants to learn guitar to get a teacher unless they 
  are very musically inclined. One should learn all their scales too. That is 
  very important,&quot; he continued.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Prince would also like to say that his band is in the process of recording an 
  album containing songs they have composed. It should be released during the 
  early part of the summer.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  &quot;Eventually I would like to go to college and start lessons again when 
  I'm much older.&quot;</font></p>
