So fair she looked tonight,<br>
the brightest star appeals to your sex.<br>
Before we do anything,<br>

They whisper secrets<br>
Only they 2 can hear<br>
When 2 R in love</p>

<p>When 2 R in love&nbsp; (love)<br>
Their stomachs will pound<br>
Every time the other comes near<br>

Can be faster than a runaway train</p>

Bathe with me<br>
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean<br>
Bathe with me<br>
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion<br>
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo<br>
When the 2 R in love<br>
l.o.v.e. - l.o.v. - can U hear me?</p>

<p>When 2 R in love<br>
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation<br>
Of penetration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let alone the act)<br>
Let alone the actual act</p>

<p>When 2 R in love<br>
The thought of his tongue in the V of her love <br>
In his mind, this thought it leads the pack</p>

<p>Come bathe with me<br>
Let's drown each other in each others emotions<br>
Bathe with me<br>
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion<br>
