1, 2, 1, 2, 3</p>

<p>There is a park that is known<br>
4 the face it attracts<br>
colorful people whose hair<br>
On 1 side is swept back<br>
The smile on their faces<br>
It speaks of profound inner peace<br>
Ask where they're going<br>
They'll tell U nowhere<br>
They've taken a lifetime lease<br>
On Paisley Park</p>

The girl on the seesaw is laughing<br>

Admission is easy, just say U<br>
Believe and come 2 this<br>
Place in your heart<br>
Paisley Park is in your heart</p>

<p>There is a woman who sits<br>
All alone by the pier<br>
Her husband was naughty<br>
And caused his wife so many tears<br>
He died without knowing forgiveness<br>
And now she is sad, so sad<br>
Maybe she'll come 2 the park<br>
And forgive him<br>
And life won't be so bad<br>
In Paisley Park</p>

<p>chorus</p>

<p>See the man cry as the city<br>
Condemns where he lives<br>
Memories die but taxes<br>
He'll still have 2 give<br>

were stronger than mules?<br>
Come 2 the park<br>
And play with us<br>
There aren't any rules<br>

----------------------<br>
There was a girl in Paris<br>
Whom he sent a letter 2<br>
Hoping she would answer back<br>
Now wasn't that a foolhardy notion<br>
On the part of a sometimes<br>
Lonely musician<br>
Acting out a whim is only good<br>
4 a condition of the heart</p>

<p>There was a dame from London<br>
Who insisted that he love her<br>
Then left him 4 a real prince<br>
From Arabia, now isn't that<br>
A shame that sometimes money<br>
Buys U everything and nothing<br>
Love, it only seems 2 buy a<br>
Terminal condition of the heart</p>

My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh<br>
Every day is a yellow day<br>
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard</p>

<p>There was a woman from the ghetto<br>
Who made funny faces just like<br>
Clara Bow, how was I 2 know<br>
That she would wear the same<br>
Cologne as U and giggle the same<br>
Giggle that U do?<br>
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool<br>
