  Stone Interview - Nov 28, 1996 Issue Used without permission By Anthony DeCurtis 
  </strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WITH A LOVING WIFE 
  AND A AND A BABY ON THE WAY, AND A 'SLAVE'TO WARNER BROS. RECORDS NO MORE 0(+&gt; 
  IS FEELING DOWNRIGHT GIDDY ABOUT HIS NEW, THREE-DISC-LONG EMANCIPATION </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;WE STILL 
  ALL RIGHT?&quot; asks 0(+&gt;, the Artist Formerly Known as Prince, with a maniacal 
  grin on his face. &quot;Let me know when I start boring you.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not any time soon. 
  0(+&gt; leaps off the arm of the couch where he had perched and bolts across 
  the room to his CD player. He presses a button to interrupt his lovely version 
  of the Stylistics' 1972 hit &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow,&quot; and then selects 
  a fiercer, guitar-charged track called &quot;Damned if I Do, Damned if I Don't.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's the sort of 
  scene you've been in a hundred times: A music-crazed friend ricochets between 
  his seat and the stereo, torn between the song he's playing and the greater 
  one you've just got to hear, between explaining what you're listening to and 
  just letting you listen to it. Two exceptions distinguish this situation: First, 
  this isn't one of my friends, this is 0(+&gt;; second, the songs he's playing 
  are amazing. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, no such 
  scenario would be complete without someone in the role of the indulgent girlfriend. 
  Cast in that spot is 0(+&gt;'s gorgeous and very pregnant wife, Mayte, 22. Wearing 
  a short black dress with white trim, the word baby stitched across her chest 
  in white above an arrow pointing to her stomach, Mayte sits quietly and smiles, 
  shaking her head fondly at 0(+&gt;' s uncontrolled enthusiasm. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm bouncing 
  off the walls playing this,&quot; 0(+&gt; says, acknowledging the obvious. His 
  sheer white shirt, lined with pastel stripes, is open to the middle of his chest 
  and extends to his knees. The shirt, open below his waist as well, contrasts 
  starkly with 0(+&gt;'s tight flared trousers. Black-mesh high-heeled boots complete 
  the ensemble. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt;, who is 
  now 38, is previewing tracks from his upcoming triple CD, Emancipation, which 
  is set for release on Nov. 19. We're in the comfortable apartment-style office 
  quarters within 0(+&gt;'s Paisley Park studio complex, in Chanhassen, Minn., 
  just outside Minneapolis, his hometown. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eager to reassert 
  his status as hitmaker, 0(+&gt; is verbally riffing in a style that recalls 
  one of his heroes, the young Muhammad Ali. &quot;I ain't scared of nobody,&quot; 
  he exclaims at one point, laughing. &quot;I wanna play you the bomb. You tell 
  me how many singles you hear - I wanna read that. The only person who kept me 
  down is R Kelly, and when I see him, he's gonna pay a price for that!&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Producer and songwriter 
  Jimmy Jam, whom 0(+&gt; fired from the funk band the Time, in 1983, also comes 
  in for some of 0(+&gt;'s good-natured rivalry. Jam, along with his partner, 
  Terry Lewis, has produced gigantic hits for both Michael and Janet Jackson, 
  as well as many other artists. Like 0(+&gt;, Jam has remained based in Minneapolis. 
  But the town isn't big enough for both of them: 0(+&gt; sees the days of Jam's 
  chart reign as numbered. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As &quot;Get Your 
  Groove On&quot; booms out of the speakers, 0(+&gt; screams over the sound: &quot;You 
  can tell Jimmy Jam I'm going to roll up to his driveway with this playing real 
  loud! Honk! Honk! What do you think he's gonna say about that?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt;'s energy 
  is so high because he is finally negotiated his way out of his contract with 
  Warner Bros, for which had recorded since his debut album, For You, was released, 
  in 1978. In his view, he is now free at last - hence the title of his new album. 
  When I comment on the relaxed, easygoing groove of the new song &quot;Jam of 
  the Year,&quot; 0(+&gt; smiles and says simply, &quot;A free man wrote that.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When I'm 
  reading a review of my work,&quot; he adds, referring to some of the negative 
  comments garnered by his previous album, Chaos and Disorder, this is what I'm 
  listening to. They're always a year late.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt;'s struggles 
  with Warner Bros have wreaked havoc on his career in recent years. He could 
  see no reason why the company could not release his albums at the relentless 
  pace at which he recorded them. Meanwhile, Warner Bros., which had signed 0(+&gt; 
  to a hugely lucrative new deal in 1992, believed the singer should put out new 
  material only every year or two, thus allowing the company to promote his albums 
  more effectively and, it hoped, to recoup its enormous investment. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Matters deteriorated 
  to the point where, in 1993, 0(+&gt; disowned the work he had recorded for Warner 
  Bros as Prince and adopted his new, unpronounceable name. He later scrawled 
  the word slave across his cheek in frustration over his inability to end his 
  relationship with the company and to put out his music the way he wanted to. 
  Such moves have caused many to question not only 0(+&gt;'s marketing instincts 
  - his album sales have plummeted - but his sanity. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Emancipation, 
  which will be released on his own NPG Records, 0(+&gt; has signed a worldwide 
  manufacturing and distribution agreement with Capitol-EMI. While neither he 
  nor Capitol-EMI would disclose financial terms, such an arrangement typically 
  means that the artist delivers a completed album to the company and assumes 
  the cost of recording it. For 0(+&gt;, those costs are relatively minimal, since 
  he plays virtually all the instruments on his albums and owns Paisley Park, 
  the studio where he records. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Capitol-EM receives 
  a fee for every copy of the album it manufactures, with the costs of the initial 
  pressing possibly absorbed by the company in lieu of an advance to 0(+&gt;. 
  In addition, the company will assist in promoting and publicizing the album, 
  which should retail for between $20 and $25. If Emancipation sells well - mind 
  you, a triple album is a risky commercial proposition - 0(+&gt; will make a 
  great deal of money. There can be no question that he is determined to do all 
  he can to make sure that the album finds its audience: 0(+&gt; is abandoning 
  his reclusive ways and planning a live global simulcast from Paisley Park and 
  a Nov. 21 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He will also launch a two-year 
  world tour early in 1997. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt; is clearly 
  stung by the skeptics who believe that he will never again achieve the aesthetic 
  and commercial heights he scaled with such albums as Dirty Mind (1980), 1999 
  (1982), Purple Rain (1984) and Sign 0' the Times (1987). At one point, as we 
  stroll through Paisley Park, he gestures toward a wall of gold and platinum 
  records. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Everything 
  you see here is not why I created music,&quot; 0(+&gt; says. Every human being 
  wants to achieve clarity so that people will understand you. But when the media 
  tell somebody what success is - No. 1 records, awards - there's no room for 
  intuition. You've put words in their heads. For me, the album is already a success 
  when I have a copy. Lovesexy is supposed to be a failure, but I go on the Internet 
  and someone says, 'Lovesexy saved my life.' &quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for people making 
  fun of his name change - &quot;The Artist People Formerly Cared About,&quot; 
  in Howard Stern's priceless slag - and his branding himself a slave says, &quot;The 
  people who really know the music don't joke about it. A lot of black people 
  don't joke about it because they understand wanting to change a situation that 
  you find yourself in.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt; has erased 
  slave from his face, and he now sports a neat, carefully trimmed goatee. Blond 
  streaks highlight his brown hair, which is slicked back. He is delicate, thin 
  and slight, almost spritelike - you feel as if a strong gust of wind would carry 
  him across the room. But far from seeming shy or skittish, as he's often portrayed, 
  he burns with a palpable intensity. He looks me in the eyes when he speaks, 
  and his thoughts tumble out rapidly. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is indicative 
  of the idiosyncratic way 0(+&gt;'s mind works that he does not permit journalists 
  to record interviews with him because he is afraid of being misrepresented His 
  fear isn't so much that he will be misquoted as that he will be trapped within 
  the prison house of his own language, frozen in his own characterization of 
  himself. For an artist who has built his career - and, to some degree, unraveled 
  a career - by doing whatever he felt like doing at any particular moment and 
  not looking back, that fear is deep. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, 0(+&gt; 
  is sufficiently concerned about saying that will damage the truce he's struck 
  with Bros. that he initially requested that a court stenographer be present 
  during our interview. Sure enough, when I arrived at Paisley Park, the stenographer 
  was sitting in the reception area, transcription machine at the ready. But after 
  0(+&gt; came out to greet me and took me on a tour of the studio, he felt comfortable 
  enough to abandon the idea. The stenographer was sent away. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's hard 
  for me to talk about the Warner Brothers stuff because I start getting angry 
  and bitter,&quot; 0(+&gt; explains before beginning to play some of the so ngs 
  from Emancipation. &quot;It's like, to talk about it, I have to get back into 
  the mind state I was in then. It's frightening.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making a triple-album 
  set, it turns out, was one of 0(+&gt;'s long-standing ambitions - and one of 
  his difficulties with Warner Bros. &quot;Sign O' the T imes was originally called 
  Crystal Ball and was supposed to be three albums,&quot; says 0(+&gt; of the 
  double album he released in 1987. `You'll overwhelm the market,' I was told. 
  `You can't do that.' </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Then people 
  say I'm a crazy fool for writing my face,&quot; he continues. &quot;But if I 
  can't do what I want to do, what am I? When you stop a man from dreaming, he 
  becomes a slave. That's where I was. I don't own Prince's music. If you don't 
  own your masters, your master owns you.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of the 
  deal to end 0(+&gt;'s relationship with the company, Warner Bros. Retains the 
  right to release two compilations of the music that the singer recorded while 
  under his contract with the label. In addition, 0(+&gt; has provided Warner 
  Bros. with an additional album of music from the thousands of hours he has in 
  his own vaults; this album would be released under the name Prince. &quot;The 
  compilations don't concern me,&quot; says 0(+&gt; dismissively. &quot;They're 
  some songs from a long time ago - that's not who I am.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite all the 
  bad blood that has flowed between them, 0(+&gt; insists he bears no grudge toward 
  his former label. He views his battles with the company as part of a spiritual 
  journey to self-awareness &quot;What strengthens is what I know,&quot; he says. 
  &quot;It was one experience - and it was my experience. I wouldn't be as clear 
  as I am today without it. I don't believe in darkness. Every thing was there 
  for me to get to this place. I've evolved to something - and I needed to go 
  through everything I went through. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;And that's 
  why I love the folks at Warner Bros. now,&quot; he says with a laugh. &quot;You 
  know that Budweiser ad - `I love you, man'? I just want to go there with them!&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Asked about the 
  concept behind Emancipation, 0(+&gt; says, &quot;It's hard to explain in sentences.&quot; 
  The album is based on complicated - not to say incomprehensible - sense of the 
  relationship among the pyramids of Egypt, the constellations and the dawn of 
  civilization. Each CD is exactly an hour long and contains 12 songs. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Recently 
  I thought about my whole career, my whole life leading up to this point - having 
  a child helps you do that - and I thought about what would be the perfect album 
  for me to do,&quot; 0(+&gt; says. &quot;People design their own plans. That's 
  when the dawn takes places. The dawn is an awakening of the mind, when I can 
  see best how to accomplish the tasks I'm supposed to do. I feel completely clear,&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt;'s marriage 
  to Mayte and the impending birth of their child were two of the important inspirations. 
  for Emancipation. It's no coincidence that what 0(+&gt; describes as his &quot;divorce&quot; 
  from Warner Bros. Has occurred right around the time of his marriage and Mayte's 
  pregnancy. &quot;I don't believe in coincidence,&quot; he says flatly. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along with covers 
  of such smoochy ballads as &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot; and the Delphonics' 
  &quot;La-La- Means I Love You,&quot; Emancipation is filled with what 0(+&gt; 
  sheepishly calls &quot;sentimental stuff.&quot; Discussing how he has been affected 
  by the prospect of fatherhood, he says, &quot;You'll definitely hear it in my 
  music.&quot; For the song &quot;Sex in the Summer,&quot; which was originally 
  titled &quot;Conception,&quot; 0(+&gt; sampled his unborn baby's heartbeat. 
  &quot;Of course, that 's a tempo,&quot; he says. &quot;The nothing baby set 
  the groove for this song. Mayte always smiles when she hears it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt; may have 
  used his baby's ultrasound as a rhythm sample, but he and Mayte did not ask 
  to know which sex their child is. &quot;It doesn't matter, &quot; 0(+&gt; says. 
  &quot;We all have the male and female with us, anyway. We'll be happy with whatever 
  God chooses to give us.&quot; And just as 0(+&gt; has no intention of once again 
  taking the name Prince - the people around him refer to him simply as &quot;the 
  Artist&quot; - he says, &quot;The baby will name itself.&quot; As he prepares 
  to preview a song called &quot;Let's Have a Baby,&quot; 0(+&gt; turns to Mayte 
  and says, &quot;You're gonna start crying - you better leave.&quot; Then he 
  explains to me, &quot;I got my house fixed up and put a crib in it. Then I played 
  this song for her, and she started crying. She had never seen my house with 
  a crib in it before.&quot; &quot;Let's have a baby,&quot; the lyrics run. &quot;What 
  are we living for?/Let's make love.&quot; As for the song's spare arrangement, 
  described by 0(+&gt; as &quot;bass, piano and silence,&quot; he says, &quot;Joni 
  Mitchell taught me that. If you listen to her early stuff, she really understands 
  that.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He points to a 
  portrait of Mayte that is framed in gold. &quot;I can't wait for my baby to 
  look up and see Mayte's eyes,&quot; he says, his voice filled with wonder. &quot;Look 
  at those eyes. That's the first thing the baby is going to see in this world.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt; has transformed 
  Paisley Park in anticipation of the birth of his child. What had been a modern 
  industrial park has become more playful and vibrant, like the psychedelic wonderland 
  implied by its name. And it would warm the heart of Tipper Gore, who was inspired 
  to found the Parents Music Resource Center when she overheard one of her daughters 
  listening to the masturbatory imagery in the Prince song &quot;Darling Nikki,&quot; 
  to hear the singer talk about how he now sees things through the eyes of a child. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When I looked 
  at some of the artwork around here from that perspective, pfft, it was out of 
  here: `Those pictures go to go,'&quot; 0(+&gt; says. &quot;I also wanted to 
  make this place more colorful, more alive. This place was antiseptic -- there's 
  life here now.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The memory of the 
  violence that his father introduced into the household when 0(+&gt; was young 
  preys on his mind. &quot;How do you discipline a child?&quot; he asks. &quot;You 
  have to imagine yourself as one of them. Would you hit yourself? You remember 
  the trauma you suffered when you suffered that.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For all of the 
  drama he has created around himself, 0(+&gt; is about music The only time he 
  seems completely relaxed is when he is jamming with his band, the New Power 
  Generation, in a rehearsal space at Paisley Park. The band, including Kathleen 
  Dyson on guitar, Rhonda Smith on bass, Eric Leeds on saxophone and Kirk Johnson 
  on percussion - sets up in a circle, with 0 (+&gt; facing the indomitable Sheila 
  E., who is sitting in on drums. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Playing his 0(+&gt;-shaped 
  guitar, the singer smiles and leads his crew through a series of rock-funk improvisations. 
  He roams the room calling for solos, pointing at whichever player is taking 
  the music to a higher plane so everyone can follow on that journey. They goof 
  around with a James Brown riff. Then, when Sheila E. introduces a syncopated 
  Latin groove, 0(+&gt; blasts off on guitar in the roaring style of Carlos Santana. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We don't 
  really know any songs yet; we're just recording everything,&quot; 0(+&gt; explains 
  to me at one point, nearly apologizing. But the music just seems to course through 
  him, and he fairly shimmers with happiness as he drifts from guitar to bass 
  to keyboards as his mood dictates. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During a short 
  break, 0(+&gt; asks Leeds to play the theme of John Coltrane's immortal &quot;A 
  Love Supreme.&quot; As Leeds articulates the line, 0(+&gt;, sitting at the keyboards, 
  crumples with joy. &quot;It's that one note,&quot; he says, laughing, isolating 
  the highest-pitched tone in the sequence. &quot;That's what tells you a madman 
  wrote it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0(+&gt;'s identification 
  with Coltrane - a driven musical genius and spiritual quester who seemed intent 
  on playing himself out of his skin - is plain. 0(+&gt; had spoken about the 
  saxophonist earlier in the day. &quot;John Coltrane's wife said that he played 
  12 hours a day,&quot; he had said. &quot;I could never do that, play one instrument 
  for that long. Can you imagine a spirits that would drive a body that hard? 
  The music business is not set up to nurture that sort of spir it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Let's see,&quot; 
  he continued &quot;According to some people, I'm bankrupt and crazy. I woke 
  up one day, and the radio said I was dead. People say, 'He changed his name; 
  he doesn't even know who he is.'&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The very notion 
  that 0(+&gt; could be perceived that way seemed painful to him. But then his 
  spirit ascended. &quot;I may not be like Muhammad Ali - I ain't predictin' no 
  rounds,&quot; he said, looking at me directly in the eyes. &quot;But I'm pretty 
  well-focused. I know exactly who I am.&quot; </font></p>
