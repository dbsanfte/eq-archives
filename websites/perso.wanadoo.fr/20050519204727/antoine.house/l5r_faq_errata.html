<p>From: Jeff Alexander (GTE) <jwa@zoot.zzz.iipo.gtegsc.com> To: l5rinfo@frpg.com Subject: FAQ 3.4 _Legend of the Five
Rings_(tm) Frequently Asked Questions Version 3.4 / June 3rd, 1997 A lot of things that
used to be in the FAQ aren't here anymore. Unclear rules have been reworded and
incorporated into the booklet you'll find in Crimson &amp; Jade Clan Decks, and errata to
particular cards have been moved either into the rulebook or onto the Emerald Edition
cards themselves. Even if you're well-versed with earlier editions of the rulebook, it's
recommended that you read through the new version to re-familiarize yourself, or if you
have a question that this FAQ doesn't answer. -- Jeff Alexander, Phoenix Clan Scribe</p>

<p>Section One: The Fundamentals</p>

<p>Q: Rings? Oh, boy! Frodo and Gandalf!</p>

<p>A: No, you want I.C.E., next door.</p>

<p>Q: Where did yourn rings come from, then?</p>

<p>A: _The_Book_Of_Five_Rings_, by Miyamoto Musashi. Imagine warring clans in feudal
Japan, then throw in wizards, dragons, and all sorts of beasties. Some of our other
influences were Sun Tzu's _The_Art_Of_War_, the _Tao_Te_Ching_, and a bookshelf of
Japanese and Chinese history and mythology.</p>

<p>Q: You mean like _Shadowfist_(tm)?</p>

<p>A: Not exactly. If uShadowfistn is John Woo, uL5Rn is Akira Kurosawa. </p>

<p>Q: How can I get some? </p>

<p>A: You can get Legend of the Five Rings at most Adventure Game stores, some comic book
stores, and some mass market outlets. The Emerald Edition of the Basic Set is still on
sale in limited quantities. It will be replaced by the Obsidian Edition near the end of
June. The first four expansion sets, Shadowlands, Forbidden Knowledge, Anvil of Despair,
and Crimson &amp; Jade, are available in limited quantities as well. Battle of Beiden
Pass, a special two-player starter set with an expanded rulebook and Basic Training guide,
is also still available.</p>

<p>Q: &quot;Semi-sorted&quot;, huh? Sounds dangerous. I think I'll just go pick up a bunch
of boost--uh, Destiny Packs instead.</p>

<p>A: Bad idea. You need at least one Clan Deck. First of all, the Clan Decks have a
Stronghold on them, which you use in play to determine your clan affiliation and to
generate gold and whatnot. Second, the semi- sorting is a good thing: 25 of the cards are
predetermined in each Deck so that they'll play well right out of the box. You also get 35
random cards in each Clan Deck; your rares and most of your uncommons are random. Third,
the Clan Decks have rulebooks in them. Finally, the only way to get the Ancestral Armors
and other nifty Clan-specific cards is to pick up Clan Decks. These cards aren't in
Destiny Packs.</p>

<p>Q: So does the semi-sorting mean you can play the game from just a Clan Deck? </p>

<p>A: Right. It's become a favorite method of play around the office. Break the seal, sort
your cards, and have at it! </p>

<p>Q: What's the rarity distribution like? </p>

<p>A: In the Imperial Edition, there were five levels of rarity. There are 100 common
cards, 100 uncommon cards, and 91 rare cards. There are also 6 &quot;rarer&quot; cards;
the rare cards were printed 2 to a sheet, and the &quot;rarer&quot; cards were printed 1
to a sheet, making them twice as rare. Also, there is a special rarity level for the
Ancestral Weapons. There is one Ancestral Weapon for each Basic Clan (Crane, Crab, Dragon,
Lion, Phoenix, and Unicorn). These cards only appear in the decks of their appropriate
Clan. In production quantities, the Ancestral Weapons are rarer than the &quot;rarer&quot;
cards, but they are easy to get -- if you want the Dragon Clan Ancestral Sword, buy an
Imperial Edition Dragon Clan deck. You'll get one. In the Emerald Edition, things are much
simpler. There are 100 rare, 100 uncommon and 100 common cards. There are also six new
Ancestral Items, the Ancestral Armors. These are sorted into the decks just like the
Ancestral Swords were in the Emerald Edition. The Ancestral Swords are not in the Emerald
Edition. Shadowlands is a bit more complex. There were 50 rare, 50 uncommon, and 50 common
cards in Destiny Packs. Shadowlands contains two new Clans, the Naga and the Scorpion.
There is a Clan Weapon in each of the new Clan Decks that only appears in those decks,
just like the Ancestral Swords from the IE. Furthermore, there is a Scorpion Clan
Personality, the Poison Master, who only appears in Scorpion Clan Decks (though it also
appears as a normal rare in Emerald). Confusing matters further, there is one card, Defend
Your Honor, which appears as both a common and a &quot;rarer&quot; uncommon, and another
card, Levy Troops, which appears only as a &quot;rarer&quot; uncommon. Forbidden Knowledge
is very simple. There are 50 rare, 50 uncommon, and 50 common cards. There are no variant
rarities. Anvil of Despair follows the same 50/50/50 pattern, and introduces Toturi's Army
and Yogo Junzo's Army. Clan Decks include deck-specific cards like Shadowlands did,
although this time they're Personalities that already exist in the basic set rather than
brand-new cards. Crimson &amp; Jade has 50 rares, 50 uncommons, and 57 commons, 14 of
which are only half as frequent as the others. There are yet two more new Clans: the
Brotherhood of Shinsei, masters of Enlightenment, and Yoritomo's Alliance, a mercenary
collection of minor Clans. The Deck-specific cards are once again never-seen-before
surprises. Beiden Pass contains two standardized 80-card decks for the Crab and Dragon
Clans. It includes two cards previously available only as promos: the inexperienced Dairya
and the Monstrous War Machine of Fu Leng. </p>

<p>Q: Hey! I got a card in Crimson &amp; Jade that has the wrong back!</p>

<p>A: Two of the regular commons, Chime of Harmony and Taro, each have one version with
the wrong back color. These misprints are unplayable, so we've declared them to be worth 3
koku each.</p>

<p>Q: How many cards are in each set? </p>

<p>A: Imperial Edition: 303 cards, six strongholds. Shadowlands: 153 cards, two
strongholds. Emerald Edition: 306 cards (2 from Shadowlands), six strongholds. Forbidden
Knowledge: 150 cards, no strongholds. Anvil of Despair: 152 cards (2 from Emerald), two
strongholds. Crimson &amp; Jade: 159 cards, two strongholds. </p>

<p>Q: Does the Imperial Edition card total include the promo sheet cards?</p>

<p>A: No. We ran a 100-card sheet (with about eighty different cards) in early August of
'95, so we'd have something to show at GenCon(tm). Almost all of the promo cards ended up
in the Imperial Edition; some of them were changed (see Section Six). Promo cards were
printed at a lower line screen than the Imperial Edition, so they're a bit fuzzier.</p>

<p>Q: &quot;Almost all,&quot; huh? How can I get hold of the others? </p>

<p>A: Aside from bribery or violence perpetrated against a Five Rings Publishing employee,
your sole recourse is to send us a self-addressed stamped envelope. Include a note telling
us that you're participating in the Legend of the Five Rings Promo Card Giveaway. (And say
&quot;please.&quot;) We'll stuff the cards in whatever you send us, so if you want your
promos protected from the depredations of the U.S. Postal Service, include a card holder
or something for us to put your cards in. The address is: L5R Card Giveaway, 4045 Guasti
Road, Suite 212, Ontario, California 91761. It's also on the back of the rulebook.</p>

<p>Q: Have you made any other promo or special cards since then? </p>

<p>A: Why, yes, we have. &quot;The False Hoturi&quot; was printed en masse and given away
in card game magazines and at a few conventions during the initial release of
uShadowlandsn; it is also available from the above address. A pre-release of
&quot;Seikua&quot;, a common Personality from Forbidden Knowledge, was given away at
GenCon '96, among other places. And each mailing of the Imperial Herald includes a new
card available exclusively to Imperial Assembly members. So far this includes &quot;The
Farther You Fall&quot;, &quot;Seppun Baka&quot;, &quot;Annexation&quot;, and &quot;Otomo
Sorai&quot;. Upcoming promo cards include The Tao of Shinsei, the Shadow Samurai Hida
Sukune, Time of the Void, and Kachiko's Kiss.</p>

<p>Q: What's your release schedule?</p>

<p> A: All that remains for the Clan War storyline is Time of the Void, scheduled for
release at GenCon '97. This is not an &quot;Expansion Set,&quot; but rather a
&quot;Conclusion Set,&quot; in which the story begun last October in the Imperial Edition
comes to an end. </p>

<p>Q: Will there be more L5R expansions after Time of the Void? I don't want to get
involved in a game which is going to die in a few months.</p>

<p>A: Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! Only the Clan War storyline will end at GenCon. L5R
will go on, with further expansions covering other periods of Rokugan's vast history.
These expansions will be fully compatible with the Clan War card backs and game mechanics.
Section Two: Magic </p>

<p>Q: I'm a little fuzzy on this whole magic thing. </p>

<p>A: OK. It works like this. Only the Personalities which have the trait
&quot;Shugenja&quot; get to do magic. Ordinary samurai and the like can't read the
scrolls. You have to attach the spell scrolls (cards) out of your hand to the shugenja.
The more spell scrolls they have, the more versatile they get. However, you can only give
a shugenja as many spells as he has Chi. (For instance, Isawa Tadaka, the Phoenix Clan's
Master of Earth, has a Chi of 3, so he only gets to carry three spells.) You can't cast a
spell straight out of your hand. You have to bow the shugenja to produce any of those cool
effects. However, the spells don't go away unless they say so. Most spells stick around
the whole game, or at least the lifetime of the shugenja -- which is often short.</p>

<p>Q: I have a spell card which doesn't say I need to bow the Shugenja it's attached to.
Can I use it and then another spell on the same Shugenja? </p>

<p>A: No. Alln spells bow the Shugenja who's using them. Most of them say to do so, but a
few don't say one way or the other, and some accidentally say to bow the scroll instead.
There are official corrections against all of these, though, so unless the spell clearly
says the shugenja doesn't need to bow, he does. </p>

<p>Q: Isawa Natsune can't bow to produce spell effects. What if something like Celestial
Alignment is in play, which lets shugenja cast spells without bowing? </p>

<p>A: Then he can cast them. Natsune isn't completely incapable of casting spells, he's
just out of practice and can only cast them if something makes it easier. Also, he's
allowed to bow to assist Rituals, since the rulebook says only the primary shugenja is
considered to be casting the spell. Section Three: Provinces</p>

<p>Q: OK, I've got magic. How about Provinces? </p>

<p>A: Such as?</p>

<p> Q: Well, first off, what are they?</p>

<p> A: A Province is an area on the table with a Dynasty card in it. You start the game
with four of them. They represent the resources you can call upon as the Daimyo of your
house. Provinces have been described as &quot;resource windows,&quot; and that's not a bad
way of looking at them. Assuming you live long enough, your entire Dynasty deck will
eventually show up in one Province or another, but you can't always be sure that the card
you want is going to be there at the right time.</p>

<p>Q: If my opponent attacks one of my Provinces, what effect does the card inn the
Province have on the battle?</p>

<p>A: None at all. Cards in Provinces aren't &quot;in play&quot;, and cards not in play
don't have any effect on cards which are in play. </p>

<p>Q: When I bring out a card from a Province into play, does it stay associated with that
Province? </p>

<p>A: No, not unless it's a Fortification or a Region, which the rules tell you to attach
to the Province it came from (pp. 25 &amp; 45). Personalities, and Holdings other than
Fortifications, roam freely about your Fief, defending any of your Provinces, beholden to
none. They are not automatically destroyed if the Province they originally came from is. </p>

<p>Q: I'm playing Dragon, and I've had a couple of my Provinces destroyed, so they're at a
Province strength of 9. The event Crysanthemum Festival pops up, and everybody adds a
Province. Does my new Province have a strength of 5 or 9? </p>

<p>A: Five. The Dragon ability refers to your &quot;remaining Provinces.&quot; This new
Province wasn't around when your other Provinces got the bonus to their strength, so it
has the unadjusted Province strength of 5. </p>

<p>Q: What if one card gives me a bonus to my Province strength, then the base strength of
all my Provinces gets changed? Do I lose the bonus?</p>

<p>A: No. If something grants you a permanent bonus or penalty to the strength of one or
more of your Provinces, that change will stick around for the rest of the game, even if
your base strength changes or the original source of the change is destroyed or altered. </p>

<p>Q: I'm being attacked. Am I required to defend my Provinces? </p>

<p>A: No. You may stand aside and let the attack through. (Just don't do it too often.)
You are also free to defend unattacked Provinces. Section Four: Battles and Duels </p>

<p>Q: When can I do an Open or Battle Action?</p>

<p>A: Go get your Crimson &amp; Jade rulebook and follow along. On pp. 37-38, we have the
dissection of the Battle Action Segment. You'll want to keep these pages handy for this
whole answer. &quot;If a player does not have a unit in the battle, he cannot conduct any
actions. The only exceptions are cards which specifically allow you to bring your own unit
into the battle, such as Superior Tactics.&quot; A little further down, it adds:
&quot;While the battle at a particular Province is being resolved, all Open and Battle
actions must either *) come from a card or token at that battle; ) move a card or token
into that battle, or; n) target or affect one of the following: a card in the battle, a
token in the battle, or the Province under attack&quot;. So the first thing you do is
check whether you have any units in the active battle right this moment. If you don't, you
can't do anything except bring one of your own units in. If you do, you can act much more
freely, though you still have to directly affect the battle being resolved, in one of the
ways listed. There are two exceptions to these restrictions. The first, of course, is any
card or effect that says it's an exception, like the Castle of Water spell or giving up
the Imperial Favor. The other is Reactions. It's always legal to use a Reaction if its
trigger event happens, whether you have units in the battle or not.</p>

<p>Q: So I can't play a defensive Terrain card if I don't send any units? </p>

<p>A: No. Terrain cards are Battle Actions, too.</p>

<p>Q: What about an Open action? </p>

<p>A: Being an Open instead of a Battle action doesn't matter -- these two types of action
follow identical rules during the Attack Phase. If you have no units in the battle, you
can't use an Open action unless it brings one of your units into the battle or it's an
explicit exception to the rules. </p>

<p>Q: What if the action is on a Fortification or Region?</p>

<p>A: Same answer as before. These card types don't get special breaks. Any Open or Battle
actions on these cards suffer the same restrictions as those on other cards. Remember that
you can always use Reactions, and that traits, such as &quot;+4 Province strength&quot;,
are always active.</p>

<p>Q: Does a Personality need to be in a battle to use a Battle action? </p>

<p>A: This is a very frequent question, and it's almost always answered incorrectly. The
answer is &quot;not necessarily&quot;. Any Battle or Open action only requires that its
performer be in the battle if it calls for a target in the &quot;opposing&quot; army
(which includes Ranged Attacks), or &quot;this battle&quot;, or &quot;another attacking
Personality&quot;, or has some other phrase which clearly implies the user has to be
there. Simply being a Battle action does not, by itself, require that the user always be
present. (This doesn't override the rules in the past three answers, by the way. Take
Kakita Yuri, for example. Yuri allows you, as a Battle action, to send home a unit that's
attacking you. Since he doesn't affect an &quot;opposing&quot; unit, he doesn't have to be
assigned to the battle himself. But you still need someonen in the battle to make taking
this action legal. If Yuri is the only Personality you have in play, he's going to have to
risk bodily harm and be assigned.)</p>

<p>Q: Let's say I've got a card that can move a unit from one Province to another. Can I
use it to bring in a unit that I haven't assigned anywhere?</p>

<p>A: No. Units not committed to an attack or defense remain in your Fief, and are not at
any particular Province. They cannot be moved &quot;from a Province&quot; or &quot;to
another Province&quot;. (They can switch places with committed Units, though -- your Fief
is still a &quot;place&quot;.) </p>

<p>Q: Let's say that two of my Provinces, A and B, were attacked. My defense at Province A
was successful. The attacker is now resolving the battle at Province B. Can I use my
unit-moving card to move a used defender from Province A into B? </p>

<p>A: Yes. Although all attacking and allied units bow and return to their controllers'
Fiefs as soon as the battle they were assigned to is over, the defender's units do not bow
at all, and do not leave their assigned Province until the entire Attack Phase is over. </p>

<p>Q: How about if I move a unit out of the battle at Province B into the battle at
Province A, which has already been resolved? </p>

<p>A: It just sits there. You don't recompute Force totals just because somebody showed up
too late to do anything but bury bodies. This isn a good way to save a valuable
Personality whose army is about to become dogmeat, though. If an attacking or allied unit
is moved into an already-resolved battle, it will still become bowed, though it will wait
and bow along with cards in the last normal battle of the phase. </p>

<p>Q: Okay, we've finally resolved the battles at both Provinces A and B. My opponent
wants to resolve a battle at Province C now, but none of us have any Units there. Is he
allowed?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Each time you're attacked, there will be a battle at each Province, even ones
with no Units at all. The attacker must resolve them all, although he can do them in any
order he chooses. </p>

<p>Q: My opponent has played Accessible Terrain against me, and has already moved one Unit
into the current battle. Now he wants to move another one in. Can he do that? The card
says we can both only bring in one Unit.</p>

<p>A: As long as Accessible Terrain is in play, both the Attacker and the Defender have
the ability to take a Battle action to move any Unit they control (except bowed Units --
see pp. 21-22) into the current battle. The word &quot;one&quot; refers to how many Units
can be moved by this single action, not the final total. Both of you may perform this
action multiple times if the terrain card is not destroyed. </p>

<p>Q: What happens if I put a Personal Standard on the leader of a Unit which can't be
targetted by Ranged Attacks? </p>

<p>A: He remains untargettable. A Personal Standard only lets you ignore the rule that you
can't shoot at a Personality if he has Followers. Something that just flat-out stops you
from shooting at that Unit at all will take precedence. </p>

<p>Q: I've got a card that lets me make several consecutive ranged attacks. How does that
work? Do I have to pick targets for all of them up front? Do my opponents get actions
between them?</p>

<p>A: Making consecutive ranged attacks works much like taking several Battle actions in a
row (even though it technically isn't). Each shot is targetted and fully resolved before
you target the next one (so you can do something like kill the only Follower in a Unit
with one shot, then kill the Personality with the next), but your opponents don't get
actions between them. </p>

<p>Q: Can I play Ambush against a Personality who can't defend, or that can't defend by
himself? </p>

<p>A: Yes.</p>

<p>Q: Since Feign Death doesn't make you bow the Personality you save anymore, if I use it
to save someone who is killed by an action during battle, that Personality will still add
to my army's Force at the end of the battle, right? </p>

<p>A: No. Feign Death returns Personalities to their controller's Fief, since that's where
all newly-played Personalities start. </p>

<p>Q: Does Ikoma Tsanuri prevent terrains from being played in the battle she was
originally assigned to or the one she's currently at?</p>

<p>A: The one she's at. If she moves away or dies, her opponents can start playing
terrains again. She won't destroy an existing terrain if she's moved into a battle,
either. </p>

<p>Q: My opponent has played a Deadly Ground against me, so now I can only take an action
which would destroy it. Superior Strategist doesn't destroy anything, but it lets me get a
card from my Fate deck and play it immediately. Can I use it to fetch and play a terrain-
destroying card? </p>

<p>A: Yes. Playing the card you pull is part of Superior Strategist's effect. It's all one
action and it destroys Deadly Ground, so it's OK. (And since it's all one action, you
can't use another Battle or Open action, like the Oracle of Earth, to put it into play.) </p>

<p>Q: Another terrain question, this time with A Samurai's Fury, which lets me take one
action between terrain effects and resolving the battle. Can I use it to play a second
terrain? If I can, does it take effect too? </p>

<p>A: Terrains stay in play until the end of the battle, so you can't play a new one
straight from your hand. You could use something like the Go Master to destroy the old
terrain and play your new one at the same time, but the new terrain still won't have any
effect since the time for terrain resolution has passed.</p>

<p>Q: Let me mix those two questions now! Can I play A Samurai's Fury after Deadly Ground?
</p>

<p>A: No, for two reasons. The first is that A Samurai's Fury can only be used if there is
a terrain in play that resolves at the end of the battle, but Deadly Ground goes into
effect right away and doesn't wait until the end. The second is that Deadly Ground
prohibits alln actions for that battle except actions that would destroy it, from the time
the terrain is played up to the destruction of cards on the losing side. A Samurai's Fury
does not, by itself, destroy a terrain. </p>

<p>Q: My opponent's Personality just killed one of mine in a duel. Shouldn't he bow now? </p>

<p>A: Only if the action he used to issue the challenge says so. Issuing a challenge
doesn't necessarily bow the challenger, nor do fighting or winning a duel. These are the
rules governing duels, unless a card says otherwise: * The challenge may be refused. If it
is, nothing happens. * If it's accepted, the loser dies, and nothing at all happens to the
winner. </p>

<p>Q: If someone focusses with the First Shout against me in a duel, I have to focus
again. What if I can't? </p>

<p>A: The answer is on the First Shout card! You only have to focus if you can. Any time
you can't focus, you must strike. Sometimes, you can only focus with some of the cards in
your hand. When this happens, you pick randomly from just those. </p>

<p>Q: If I've only played one First Shout, does that let me play as many Second Shouts as
I want? </p>

<p>A: Yes. Ditto with the Second and Third. </p>

<p>Q: Do I have to play all my Shouts on one Personality as either focusses or Battle
Actions, or can I play some one way and some the other? </p>

<p>A: You can mix them. </p>

<p>Q: Can I ignore the special requirements on the Second and Third Shout by playing them
face-down as regular focusses? </p>

<p>A: No. You can play them face-down as regular focusses if you want, but you still can't
focus them out of order. These cards cann be used freely for their focus values outside of
duels, like a Tactician's Force bonus, for example. </p>

<p>Q: Do the focus values of The First Shout and Moving the Shadow get added like normal? </p>

<p>A: Yes (we ran out of space to be clear about this). </p>

<p>Q: A couple cards, like The Second Shout, say their focus adds to your duelist's Chi
&quot;as normal&quot;. What if the duel isn't a duel of Chi? </p>

<p>A: Then it adds to whatever the duel is based on. This is true of anything that
&quot;counts as a Focus&quot; or &quot;adds to Chi as normal&quot;. Some Chi-changing,
duel-related effects don't have one of these two magic phrases in them. Togashi Yoshi is a
common example. These always affect Chi.</p>

<p>Q: How does The Coward's Way work with Poisoned Weapon or poison tokens? Do these
affect both Personalities? </p>

<p>A: These effects aren't duel results, so they only affect your original participant.
The extra Personality bring in with The Coward's Way doesn't get involved in the duel
except for adding a Chi bonus and sharing the consequences of losing.</p>

<p>Q: Speaking of poison tokens, could you explain how Shosuro Hametsu, the Poison Master,
works? Why would I want to poison my own people? </p>

<p>A: The poison tokens aren't -2C tokens. They cause no ill effects to the person holding
them. If a Personality with a poison token enters a duel, you can destroy the token in
response, and this will cause your opponentn in the duel to suffer -2C until the end of
the turn as soon as either of you strikes. Like Poisoned Weapon, if this kills your
opponent immediately, the duel is cancelled without a winner or loser. Unlike Poisoned
Weapon, Another Time won't prevent the penalty. </p>

<p>Q: I just played Iaijutsu Challenge on my opponent's Personality, and he refused the
duel. Can I play Court Jester to double his honor loss to 14? It was his refusal that made
him lose honor. </p>

<p>A: It may have been his decision to refuse the duel, but the action causing the loss is
your own Iaijutsu Challenge, so you cannot use Court Jester to double the loss. The word
&quot;action&quot; has a strict definition in L5R, and only applies to effects that start
with one of the four action types: Limited, Open, Battle, or Reaction. For the same
reason, your opponent can use Defend Your Honor against the honor loss, too. </p>

<p>Q: Speaking of Defend Your Honor, what if I play it and step forward a samurai when my
opponent has no Personalities? Is he forced to refuse the challenge, since he has no one
to accept it? </p>

<p>A: Yup. </p>

<p>Q: The Ring of Fire says I can only play it if I win a duel against an opponent who had
a higher Chi before being challenged. Does that mean I can't play the ring unless my
Personality is the challenger? </p>

<p>A: No. You can play the Ring of Fire no matter who issued the challenge. Section Five:
Rules Clarifications &quot;Who makes the rules? Someonen *else!*&quot; &quot;No Spill
Blood,&quot; [Oingo] Boingo Our crack squad of rules lawyers is perpetually busy hammering
out general applications of rules under which entire classes of questions can be answered.
These general rulings will make it into the next edition Rulebook, but until then they'll
be here. If you have a question, check to see whether the same question about a similar
card is here. -DJT </p>

<p>Q: When a player calls for allies, does he have to invite either everyone or no one, or
can he invite only who he wants? </p>

<p>A: He can just invite a few, and deny the privilege to the others. </p>

<p>Q: Junzo's Army can't have allies. Does that mean he can still be an ally to someone
else? </p>

<p>A: No. Junzo can't have allies in any way, and no one can ever take an action which
would make him an ally, like playing Tides of Battle. He also can't make use of the
Alliance or Unexpected Allies events.</p>

<p>Q: If Junzo's Army can't lose honor, how can he use all those Shadowlands cards that
cost honor to use? And what about the Dark Oracles? Their honor losses can't be changed. </p>

<p>A: Honor loss is never a cost for playing a card. It's more like a side effect. And
Junzo's Army doesn't change honor losses, it outright ignores them. The Dark Oracles work
just fine for him. </p>

<p>Q: I'm not sure how to figure out what cards Junzo can't use, or why he's allowed to
use the ones listed in the Anvil of Despair rulebook. </p>

<p>A: For one, he can't do anything Political. Besides actions which say
&quot;Political&quot; right on them, the Glossary tells us that anything that alters an
honor loss or gain is Political, as are both lobbying for the Favor and giving it up to
play an action or a card. Note that actions which causen an honor loss or gain aren't
necessarily Political, nor are Reactions which involve the Favor. Junzo also can't perform
any actions which immediately and consistantly cause an honor loss to another player. He's
allowed to use effects which aren't actions (Dragon Sword is Broken), which don't cause an
immediate loss (Utter Defeat), or that don't always cause a loss (Iaijutsu Challenge). </p>

<p>Q: What happens if I spend full price for the inexperienced Toturi in a Toturi's Army
deck? </p>

<p>A: You waste 2 gold. Since Toturi enters play dishonored, his effective Personal Honor
is 0. You gain no honor, and he remains dishonored with his lower Force and Chi. </p>

<p>Q: Can Toturi's Army play Alliance and pick Dragon Clan, and get dual- Clan
Personalities for 4g less or 2g less plus honor?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Vice-versa, too.</p>

<p>Q: Can I use the Monk Stronghold to play the Ring of the Void from my Fate deck if my
hand is completely empty? </p>

<p>A: Yes. You can also use it in conjunction with cards that let you play a Ring by
satisfying some other conditions. The idea behind the Brotherhood is that they can play a
Ring from their Fate Deck as though it were in their hand, and this overrides phrasing
that refers to a Ring being &quot;in your hand&quot; or being played &quot;from your
hand&quot;. </p>

<p>Q: Do Kihos played by Monks count towards the Ring of Air? The rulebook says Kihos are
spell effects, but the Ring says you must produce three spell effects by using Shugenja. </p>

<p>A: Kihos count even when Monks use them. The Ring of Air will be reworded in future
printings to avoid this conflict. Monks' built-in abilities don't count, since they're not
&quot;innate&quot;. </p>

<p>Q: Why aren't there any Personalities with the &quot;Brotherhood of Shinsei&quot;
trait? I can't purchase anyone cheaply or for honor! </p>

<p>A: Personalities with the &quot;Monk&quot; trait are aligned with the Brotherhood, and
work just like native Personalities do for any other Clan. There is no separate
&quot;Brotherhood of Shinsei&quot; trait. </p>

<p>Q: So if I play Oath of Fealty in a Brotherhood deck, all my non-monks gain the Monk
trait?</p>

<p>A: Exactly. And to answer your next question, yes, this means they can start doing
monkly things like using Kihos. </p>

<p>Q: But what about the opposite case: I play an Oath on some Monks in a non-Brotherhood
deck. Do they LOSE the Monk trait? That doesn't seem right. &quot;Monk&quot; is a
profession, like &quot;Shugenja&quot;. </p>

<p>A: With the release of Crimson &amp; Jade, &quot;Monk&quot; works like a Clan
Affiliation, so it will be stripped by swearing the Oath. Think of it as forsaking their
ascetic ways to embrace their new Clan's philosophies. </p>

<p>Q: So I guess &quot;Yoritomo's Alliance&quot; and &quot;Mantis Clan&quot; are
equivalent too? </p>

<p>A: Correct. Notice this works both ways. It's legal to do something like attach a
&quot;Mantis Clan only&quot; card to a &quot;Fox Clan * Yoritomo's Alliance&quot;
Personality, for example. </p>

<p>Q: About this new &quot;Foo Rule&quot; on p. 30... Does this really mean there aren't
any more Fu Leng cards? They're all titled &quot;Something Something Something of Fu
Leng&quot;, but we're supposed to ignore everything after the &quot;of&quot; now. </p>

<p>A: Consider this official errata to the rulebook: the new rule that you ignore words in
the second half of a &quot;Foo of Bar&quot; phrase only applies when that phrase appears
in the boldface traits area of a card. If it's in the title, every word counts, just like
before. </p>

<p>Q: Is it really legal to use the Dark Oracle of Water to do something like sending a
single card-heavy Unit on a suicide attack against yourself, so that you gain lots of
honor by killing it?</p>

<p>A: Okay. This question strikes a common chord with a lot of other questions, and that
chord is this: when, exactly, does card text really override the game's general rules? The
answer is, &quot;not as often as you might think&quot;. Let's read that Dark Oracle:
&quot;Bow the Oracle after Cavalry have been assigned in the battle phase. You may now
assign any of your unassigned units to attack or defend any of the Defender's
Provinces.&quot; At first glance this card lets you commit your own Units into any battle,
even on both sides, and regardless of whether you've been invited by either side as an
ally. But nothing on the card specificallyn allows this. Any rules the card doesn't
clearly allow you to break must still be obeyed, and it's against the rules to attack
yourself, help both sides, or commit or move in uninvited troops. So, all the Oracle lets
you do is assign the troops that you could have assigned normally, just after everyone
else's.<br>
Here are some other examples: o The Imperial Edition Wyrm Riders didn't say that they
needed to bow to make their Ranged Attack. But unlike Togashi Rinjin, the Riders didn't
say they could make it without bowing, either. Since the Rulebook says that Ranged Attacks
bow the shooting card, the Riders still needed to bow. o Kaiu Suman allows you to attach a
new Fortification to any of your Provinces. However, you cannot use Suman to attach the
Moat that just appeared in one Province to another Province which already has one. Suman
only overrides the rule that Fortifications are always attached to the Province they
appear in -- he doesn't override the rule that Provinces can't have duplicate
Fortifications. o The Kaiu Pass Region allows you to attach one weapon or armor to
Personalities that enter play from its Province, for 4g less. But this doesn't let you
attach an item to someone who can't have one, like a Dragon. o Many cards allow you to
challenge &quot;any Personality&quot;, or &quot;any Shadowlands Personality&quot;, or
whatever. But the Glossary defines a &quot;challenge&quot; as always happening between one
Personality which you control and another which you do not, so none of these cards allow
you to challenge your own Personalities, despite the word &quot;any&quot;. </p>

<p>Q: The rulebook says token Followers also count as cards for purposes of being
transferred or bowed, figuring honor at the end of battle, and being affected by other
cards. Are there some obscure situations where they only count as tokens? </p>

<p>A: No. Token Followers -- and only token Followers -- always count as both tokens and
cards. </p>

<p>Q: What happens if more than one Event comes up in a turn? Do I get to pick the order
they happen in? </p>

<p>A: No, you don't. You turn over Dynasty cards one at a time, from left to right. Each
Event is resolved as soon as it's revealed, before you even turn over the next card.</p>

<p>Q: When do Dynasty cards normally get replaced? </p>

<p>A: You refill a Province with your next Dynasty card as soon as it becomes empty, no
matter what emptied it. If it's empty due to revealing an Event, refill it after resolving
the Event [p. 15]. &quot;Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. (I am
large, I contain multitudes.)&quot; -Walt Whitman, &quot;Song of Myself&quot; </p>

<p>Q: Which Personalities are Unique? They all seem to have particular names. Can I really
have three of all of them? </p>

<p>A: Unique cards have the word &quot;Unique&quot; in their traits area. Though almost
all Personality cards depict specific individuals, most are merely representative of their
particular station in Rokugan and have many peers, thus allowing you to put three in your
deck. It'd also be much less fun if you had to play cards like &quot;Young Lion
Samurai&quot; or &quot;Mysterious Phoenix Shugenja.&quot; </p>

<p>Q: Can I overlay a Unique version of a Personality with a Unique, Experienced version? </p>

<p>A: Yes. In fact, that's they only way you can put the Experienced one into play if the
original is already out. You can't play it separately because of the Uniqueness Rule, and
you can't &quot;underlay&quot; Experienced cards with the original version. </p>

<p>Q: Can I overlay a Personality with the Experienced version if my Family Honor is below
the Experienced version's minimum honor? </p>

<p>A: Yes, you can do this. Overlaying an Experienced Personality represents that
Personality going through some personal change. Since you're not bringing someone new into
play, you don't need to meet that person's approval. </p>

<p>Q: What if the original is bowed?</p>

<p>A: Overlaying isn't an &quot;action&quot;, so you can still do it.</p>

<p>Q: Do I get honor for overlaying a Personality with her Experienced version? I'm paying
the full price, which is zero.</p>

<p>A: No. You're not hiring someone new. This means you won't lose honor, either, should
the Experienced version normally cause a loss. </p>

<p>Q: The rules say I can overlay a normal card with the Experienced one &quot;if I have
an earlier version...already in play when the Experienced Personality appears&quot;. Does
this mean &quot;just if&quot;, or &quot;if AND ONLY if&quot;?</p>

<p>A: Just &quot;if&quot;. Any time you have the original version of a Personality in play
and the Experienced version face-up during your Dynasty Phase, you can overlay it, even if
the Experienced one appeared first. </p>

<p>Q: Can Otaku Kamoko attach any of the Unicorn Clan Ancestors? She says she can't have
infantry Followers, and none of the Ancestors have the Cavalry trait. But the rulebook
says Ancestors don't act like real Followers most of the time. What's the answer?</p>

<p>A: Kamoko cannot attach them. Although Ancestors do break a lot of the Follower rules,
attachment restrictions aren't one of them. Ancestors may not change the Cavalry status of
their unit, but they are not Cavalry themselves, and Kamoko will not attach infantry. </p>

<p>Q: What if I put Mounts on her first? </p>

<p>A: It won't help. Ancestors aren't affected by cards that affect Followers, so the
Mounts will not give them the Cavalry trait. Kamoko's attachment requirement isn't
neutralized because it affects Kamoko, not the Ancestor. </p>

<p>Q: Can I give one of my Personalities multiple bonuses in a turn? For instance, can I
play Meditation on a Personality and then give him +2F with the Retired General? What
about 2 Meditations? </p>

<p>A: Sure. These are all legal. </p>

<p>Q: What about responding to an event with more than one Reaction? </p>

<p>A: That's also legal, though remember, you cannot play your second Reaction until
you've given everyone else a chance to play a Reaction of their own. One of their
Reactions (or even yourn first one!) could make your second Reaction illegal or much less
effective.</p>

<p>Q: I've used some actions to give my army Force bonuses in battle. How long do they
keep these plusses? </p>

<p>A: All card effects last until the end of the turn unless they say otherwise [p. 30].
This includes bonuses from Terrains. </p>

<p>Q: You mean if, say, I'm defending, and I play Dispersive Terrain to give every
Personality in my army +2F, and then I play Counterattack and attack my opponent back on
that same turn, I still have +2F on everyone? </p>

<p>A: Exactly. Dispersive Terrain doesn't say the bonus wears off at the end of the
battle, so it lasts for the rest of the turn. </p>

<p>Q: And the Matsu Gohei that attacked me originally (&quot;Gains a 2F bonus when
attacking.&quot;) which my opponent played Charge on (&quot;Add a 3F bonus to one
attacking Lion Personality&quot;) still has +5F in his defense? </p>

<p>A: Only +3F actually. Gohei's built-in bonus is only active &quot;when attacking&quot;.
It continually checks whether Gohei is attacking and automatically turns itself on or off,
depending. Charge, on the other hand, can only be played on someone who is attacking
*right that moment*, but like Dispersive Terrain, it then lasts the whole turn. </p>

<p>Q: Can I use an Open action at the start of someone else's turn, before he does
anything? I thought Open actions were usable anytime. </p>

<p>A: You can't do this. Re-read pp. 33-34. The active player has the first option to
either perform one legal act (a Limited or Open action, attaching or exchanging Fate
cards, or lobbying for the Favor) or pass during his or her own Action phases. This option
then travels clockwise, though every other player can only use Open actions. Everyone has
to wait his turn, and no one can perform more than one action at a time. This means that
whoever's turn just ended must always wait for everyone else to get &quot;first digs&quot;
before he can do anything himself. Also, Open actions aren't usable at any time, just
during any player's Action Phase and during battle. You can't use them during the Events
Phase, for instance. </p>

<p>Q: Do Personality cards which I've discarded from my hand count as Honorable or
Dishonorable dead?</p>

<p>A: Neither one. They're discarded, not dead. </p>

<p>Q: I just discarded a Follower card. Can I use Animate the Dead to attach him to a
Personality?</p>

<p>A: Nope. Animate the Dead specifically says &quot;...back into play,&quot; and
discarded Followers never made it into play in the first place. You only get to Animate
those cards which are authentically Dead. </p>

<p>Q: Does this mean I also can't use Enlightenment to &quot;return&quot; a Ring &quot;to
my hand&quot; that went straight from my Fate Deck to my discard pile? </p>

<p>A: Uh...actually, that's allowed. It's one of the things Enlightenment was designed to
do. </p>

<p>Q: What if I have a dishonored Personality and I do something to increase his Personal
Honor? </p>

<p>A: It still counts as 0, because the Personality is still dishonored and you always
apply the &quot;dishonored means Personal Honor = 0&quot; rule last. If you restore the
Personality to honorable status, you'll see your increase. </p>

<p>Q: What happens if a Personality has some cards attached and then something happens
that makes it illegal for her to have them? Are they destroyed? </p>

<p>A: No. Once any sort of card or token has been legally attached to a Personality, it
stays there until something specifically destroys it [p. 25]. This is true even if the
Personality becomes unable to use the card. For example, if a shugenja with spells loses
the Shugenja trait, she can no longer cast them or attach any more, but the ones she
already has stay on her. They can still be moved to other Shugenja, too. </p>

<p>Q: I've got a Personality with a Master Smith weapon token. Can I bow him and another
Personality to move the token between them? </p>

<p>A: No. The Moving rules on pp. 23-24 only allow you to exchange cards, and Follower
tokens are the only tokens which count as cards. </p>

<p>Q: I'm targeting a 1F Personality with an effect that makes him lose 2F until the end
of the turn. Does he have a 0F or a -1F? </p>

<p>A: 0F. The only thing in the game that goes into negative numbers is Family Honor. You
will have to compensate for the leftover -1F if you want to increase his Force later this
turn, though. Setting the effective value of a stat to a minimum of 0 is always done after
adding together all current bonuses and penalties. </p>

<p>Q: Explosives says &quot;Destroy any one Holding.&quot; Does this include Retainers? </p>

<p>A: Yes. (Splat.) Retainers are a class of Holding -- look at the border -- and are
affected by anything that affects Holdings in general as well as by things which only
affect Retainers. This also means they come into play bowed, and so won't typically be
usable until your next turn. </p>

<p>Q: Can I use Alliance on the Unaligned Personalities? </p>

<p>A: No. &quot;Unaligned&quot; isn't a clan. </p>

<p>Q: Say I'm holding the Ring of the Void and some other cards, and I'm forced to discard
my entire hand. Can I discard them one at a time, holding the Ring for last so I can play
it? </p>

<p>A: No. You discard your entire hand at once. It is also illegal to use a
discard-and-redraw effect, such as the Mempo of the Void, to discard your entire hand
except the Ring and then play the Ring before drawing your replacement cards. </p>

<p>Q: Why isn't the Phoenix Clan Champion &quot;Unique&quot;? </p>

<p>A: This is semi-intentional, based partly in story reasons and partly in the original
rush to get the cards to the printers. According to our story continuity folks, there are
tales that the Phoenix Clan Champion has been seen talking to himself. Some people have
been concerned that there are play-balance considerations, but so far nothing abusive has
been achieved, so play him as written. </p>

<p>Q: The Event Rise of the Phoenix just came up, and two players both want to bring back
the same Unique Personality. Who wins? </p>

<p>A: It goes around the table clockwise from the active player (the one who just turned
up the Event). This is also true for Unexpected Allies. </p>

<p>Q: My opponent has a Personality in play that won't normally join my Clan. Can I play
Kolat Master on it and steal it? </p>

<p>A: No. Coming under your control from someone else's still involves joining your Clan,
which that Personality cannot do. </p>

<p>Q: Can I copy him with the Egg of P'an Ku, too? Or can I put him in my Dynasty Deck
anyway and hope for a lucky Unexpected Allies to bring him out? What about Return of the
Fallen Lord? </p>

<p>A: The Egg will work, as you're not asking the real person to join you, you're creating
a copy which enters play already in your service. Unexpected Allies won't, since the
Personality would still be joining your clan (he's just not asking for compensation).
Return of the Fallen Lord won't work either, for the same reason. </p>

<p>Q: My Crab Clan Oni gains a +1F/+1C for every Crab in play. Does this include itself? </p>

<p>A: Yes. Cards may gain bonuses from themselves. It's a Crab, so it gives itself a
+1F/+1C. </p>

<p>Q: What happens if I play Oath of Fealty in a non-Naga deck and convert some Naga
Personalities to my clan? Do they stop receiving Naga card bonuses? </p>

<p>A: It depends. Remember, &quot;any card with 'Foo' in the title or trait area is
considered to be a 'Foo' card&quot; (p. 30). The Nagan trait acts like a Clan affiliation
(p. 31), so it gets added/removed by Oath of Fealty, but card titles don't change. A card
with the word &quot;Naga&quot; in its title will always be a &quot;Naga card&quot;, no
matter what Clan it is.</p>

<p>Q: So if I'm playing a Naga deck, and I Oath some two-leggers, they now get Naga card
bonuses? </p>

<p>A: They have the Nagan trait now, so they fully count as Naga cards. </p>

<p>Q: How can a Naga deck use Dashmar to win a game through honor? Their Stronghold says
they're not allowed to do that! </p>

<p>A: Using Dashmar isn't an Honor Victory, it's a special victory generated by a card.
The Naga can win this way, as can other Clans which manage to steal him, or copy him or
his ability. </p>

<p>Q: Now that Follower tokens also count as cards, things like the Naga Shugenja will
give the Stronghold's tokens Force bonuses, right?</p>

<p>A: Wrong. Those Followers can't get Force bonuses because the Stronghold says so. It
has nothing to do with whether they're cards. </p>

<p>Q: Can I use Sympathetic Energies to move Togashi Mitsu's +1F/+1C fire tokens onto any
other Personality, or only onto another Mitsu? The spell says the new recipient has to be
legal, and only Mitsu creates fire tokens. </p>

<p>A: Here's the deal. Unless there is specific text to the contrary somewhere, any token
may be placed on any Personality. This means that tokens which are always created on one
particular card, such as Togashi Mitsu's and Shuten Doji's, can generally be moved to
anyone, while tokens that give you a choice of where to put them, such as the Revered
Sensei's and the Naga Stronghold's, can only be moved onto someone who could have been
given them in the first place. </p>

<p>Q: Since I can move fire tokens onto anyone, what happens if I move one onto a bowed
Personality? Does he have to remove the token instead of straightening? </p>

<p>A: Only if he's another Togashi Mitsu. You see, the only things written on Mitsu's fire
tokens are the +1F/+1C bonus and the word &quot;fire&quot;. If a token with the word
&quot;fire&quot; winds up on a Personality who has special text regarding fire tokens,
then the two interact. Otherwise, all the token does is bestow its +1F/+1C bonus. For
example, you could not move a sixth fire token onto a fully-loaded Mitsu, since his card
says he &quot;may not have more than five fire tokens&quot;. On the other hand, you can
move as many as you like onto someone who doesn't say this (which is everyone else).
Likewise, fire tokens will not cause anyone but Togashi Mitsu to stay bowed during the
Straighten Phase, or to bow even after defending in a battle. Note that if the token is
something universally meaningful, such as a Follower or Item rather than a
&quot;fire&quot; token, you're more likely to run across a rule in the rulebook or on the
cards that makes moving the token illegal. You can't move a Master Smith token onto
someone who already has a weapon, for example, nor could you move a Follower token onto an
Ogre Bushi, or a non-Cavalry Follower token onto Otaku Kamoko. </p>

<p>Q: Speaking of Togashi Mitsu, what happens if I somehow manage to get some Mantis
Samurai on him, and he becomes bowed with fire tokens? Will he lose one token during every
players' Straighten Phase? </p>

<p>A: Yes. This works. </p>

<p>Q: Just ooooone more question on this fellow... The Experienced Togashi Mitsu has no
fancy bowing restrictions, unlike the original. What if I overlay him? Those seem to be
traits, and you don't copy traits when you overlay. </p>

<p>A: Those &quot;traits&quot; are part of the original ability to gain fire tokens, and
they all come with it (if you'll notice, it's all one sentence). An overlayed Experienced
Mitsu will bow and stay bowed just like the old one if he has anyn fire tokens, whether
they're +1/+1 tokens from the old ability or 0/0 tokens from the new one. </p>

<p>Q: If I end up with zero Personalities with plague tokens while Rampant Plague is out,
can I become immune by killing &quot;all&quot; of them? </p>

<p>A: You sure can. Destroying all your plague-bearing Personalities is easy when you
don't have any. (Point of interest: there are other cards, such as Plague Zombies, which
generate plague tokens too. You'd need to destroy anyone with these tokens as well if you
want to become immune to Rampant Plague. On the other hand, once you do, those other
plague-bearing cards won't give you plague tokens anymore either!)</p>

<p>Q: Can I use Bayushi Goshiu to duplicate an honor loss at an opponent, then use another
reaction to reduce my own loss?</p>

<p>A: That would be nice, wouldn't it? Unfortunately, you can't. Read Goshiu's card
carefully. His ability can only be used &quot;after you have lost Family Honor&quot;.
After you've actually taken a loss, you can't change the amount.</p>

<p>Q: My opponent is at -18 honor. I have one Province left, and no one to defend it. He
attacks and destroys it. Can I play Plea of the Peasants so he loses 5 honor and the game
ends in a tie? </p>

<p>A: This question is actually quite similar to the one we just had, and like it, the
answer lies in carefully reading the Reaction to see whether it gets played before or
after the event it's reacting to. In this case, Plea of the Peasants gets played
&quot;when another player has destroyed&quot; one of your Provinces. &quot;Has
destroyed&quot; is past-tense -- this Reaction gets played after the event. Unfortunately,
you were eliminated from the game the moment you lost your last Province, and you can't
play anything after being eliminated. Looks like your opponent is victorious. The moral is
this: read your Reactions closely! Most of them don't happen at the same time as the
occasion they're reacting to. </p>

<p>Q: The Marsh Troll says it &quot;destroys one card in its unit&quot;. Since it doesn't
say &quot;one othern card&quot;, can I have it destroy itself? </p>

<p>A: No. </p>

<p>Q: An opponent keeps using Kolat Infiltrator to cancel my purchases. Is this right?</p>

<p>A: Yes. Kolat Infiltrator counters the &quot;effect&quot; of a Holding. This includes
gold-gathering as well as normal abilities. How it works is like this: when you play a
card, announce what it is and indicate everything you're doing to generate the money for
it. If any reactions stop you from getting enough gold, you can generate more to make up
the loss if you're willing and able. Otherwise, the insufficient amount is completely
taxed, and the card you tried to play goes back to where it came from. You can't spend the
money you've already made on something else, though you can change how you're trying to
play the original card if that changes how much it'll cost (for instance, paying for a
less-skilled Geisha Assassin, or deciding not to gain 2 honor from an aligned
Personality). </p>

<p>Q: Speaking of Kolats, can I put the Night Medallion on the Experienced Lion Sensei?
What happens if I do? </p>

<p>A: The Experienced Sensei has the Kolatn trait, so he can wear the Medallion. If you've
played him over an original Sensei, the Medallion modifies all his abilities and lets him
place +3/+3 sensei tokens, up to 4 on each Personality. Existing sensei tokens don't
change to +3/+3, though, and any normal Sensei still produce +1/+1 tokens and can only
place a first or second token on a card.</p>

<p>Q: Since the Medallion adds +2 to the real mathematical value of numbers, if I put it
on a card whose ability makes me &quot;lose 1 honor&quot;, would I actually start gaining
1 honor? After all, &quot;lose 1 honor&quot; means I adjust my honor by -1, and -1 + 2 =
+1. </p>

<p>A: You're reading too much into that ruling. The number printed on the card is
&quot;1&quot;, and 1 + 2 = 3. You would &quot;lose 3 honor&quot;. </p>

<p>Q: What if I have just enough Family Honor to bring a Personality out, but I lose some
honor while gathering gold for her? Can I still hire her with the money? </p>

<p>A: No way. She will turn her nose up at your filthy lucre (though the Emperor's tax
collectors won't). You must meet all minimum honor requirements after gathering your money
for a card. However, you no longer have to meet those requirements when you START
gathering your payment. All that matters is how you stand when you approach her with the
money. (This rule only applies to purchasing cards, by the way. Anything else you try to
do has to be legal before you can start it.) </p>

<p>Q: Can I pay 7 gold for a really expensive shugenja with the Phoenix Stronghold, then
take advantage of its new Shadowlands trait with something like the Kuni Wastelands, which
makes Shadowlands cards cheaper? </p>

<p>A: No. The shugenja doesn't gain the Shadowlands trait until she's in play. </p>

<p>Q: I want to do something to one card, but I'm not allowed to target it. Can I aim my
effect at another card, then use something like the Ring of Air to redirect it to the card
I really want it to hit? </p>

<p>A: No. You can only redirect actions to things they could have been aimed at in the
first place. (This also means you can't redirect Ranged Attacks back to a card in the
firer's army, unless your redirection card says you can.) Redirection effects are only
useful in deflecting your opponents' actions or neutralizing their own redirections. They
can't give your own actions a wider range of targets. </p>

<p>Q: What if the spell always affects one thing, like, say, the player casting it? Can I
use the Ring of Air to make it affect someone else?</p>

<p>A: Go back and read p. 22 of the C&amp;J rulebook. If you never have a choice as to
what gets affected, then the spell doesn't have a target and you can't change what it will
affect. </p>

<p>Q: Can I lobby for the Imperial Favor on the same turn that I use it? </p>

<p>A: Sure. You can even use it twice in one turn if you start with it from the turn
before: use it once, lobby for it to get it back, then use it again. The only thing you
can't do in one turn is lobby twice. </p>

<p>Q: Can I lobby for the Favor if I don't have the highest honor, or if my Family Honor
is below zero?</p>

<p>A: Yes, and yes. If you haven't already lobbied this turn, and you can bow a
Personality with a Personaln Honor above zero (and you don't already have the Favor, of
course), you are allowed to lobby. </p>

<p>Q: Kakita Ichiro can lobby &quot;even if you have already lobbied for the Favor once
this turn&quot;. Does &quot;once&quot; mean &quot;exactly once&quot; or &quot;at least
once&quot;?</p>

<p>A: &quot;Exactly once.&quot; Ichiro can only give you a second lobby attempt. And the
order is important. You can't use Ichiro first and then someone else second. </p>

<p>Q: The Experienced Hooded Ronin lets me bring out the Seven Thunders for free. Who are
the Seven Thunders? </p>

<p>A: Story-wise, the Seven Thunders are the spiritual descendents of the original seven
Clan founders who imprisoned Fu Leng the first time he manifested. Game-wise, there aren't
any...yet.</p>

<p>Q: If I use my Ninja Shapeshifter's copy-ability to copy the Uniquen ability, are all
my opponents' Shapeshifters destroyed? </p>

<p>A: Check out the definitions on p. 30. &quot;Unique&quot; is not an ability, it is a
trait, and the Shapeshifter cannot copy traits. Only Limited, Open, Battle, and Reaction
actions are &quot;abilities&quot;. </p>

<p>Q: But the Emerald Edition NSS says he can copy traits too. </p>

<p>A: Yeah, we know. That was a MISTAKE. He can't copy traits. This is Very, Very
Official. Spread the word! </p>

<p>Q: So I can't copy the Crab Oni's ability to gain +1/+1 per Crab Personality I control?
</p>

<p>A: Again, that isn't an &quot;ability&quot;. The NSS can't copy it. </p>

<p>Q: I have a Ninja Shapeshifter, initially 2F/2C with a +2/+2 weapon token, and I want
him to copy an Ogre Bushi's Force of 6. That means the Ninja becomes a total 8F/4C
creature, right? Six Force from the Ogre, plus two from the weapon? </p>

<p>A: Actually, no. Check out p. 31 again: &quot;If a card copies a value from another
card, the current value of the card being copied replaces the current value of the copying
card.&quot; The important phrase is &quot;current value&quot;, which is the base value
plus all modifiers. The current value of your Ninja's Force before the shapechange is 4: a
base of 2 plus 2 for the weapon. After the change it's 6, since that's what the Ogre's
current Force is. Since this 6 is now the Ninja's current Force, we don't add anything to
it -- &quot;current value&quot; already includes all bonuses and penalties. If your NSS
has any kind of a weapon, you'll almost always end up in a situation where The Whole Is
Not Equal to The Sum of the Parts if you copy someone else's Force or Chi. In our example
above, the +2F from his own sword apparently disappears. The sword doesn't change from a
+2/+2 weapon into something else, nor does the NSS's base Force of 2 change. What does
happen when you copy a stat is that you stop using basic math to figure his total and just
use the copied value on faith (plus or minus any further changes that happen aftern the
shapeshift, of course). That's ninja trickery for you. </p>

<p>Q: What other cards work with current stat values like this? </p>

<p>A: Most of them. Every card that refers to or alters another card's stat and doesn't
mention &quot;printed&quot; or &quot;base value&quot; works with the total current value.
For example, Energy Transference &quot;switches the current Chi and Force of any one
Personality&quot;. A base 1F/4C Personality with a Wakizashi (+0/+1) who has Meditated
(+1/+2) would become 7F/2C, not the 5F/4C you'd get if only her base stats were swapped.</p>

<p> Q: Is there anything else I should know about the 'Shifter? </p>

<p>A: Two things. The first is that using another card's ability is a two-step process,
since you have to take one action to copy the ability first, then another to actually use
it. You can't just duplicate an effect cold-turkey -- it takes planning and forethought in
some situations to use it right. The other thing is that the NSS's ability is a targettedn
action, since you have to pick which card to copy. This means your opponents can use
Mamoru or Investigation to counter an attempt to copy their cards, and it means you can't
copy anything from your own bowed Personalities.</p>

<p>Q: Can I use Mamoru or Investigation to stop a ninja from being assigned to attack me? </p>

<p>A: No. These cards can only stop an action which targets you, your Stronghold, or one
of your cards (which includes your opponent's own Mamoru trying to cancel one of yourn
ninja actions). Being assigned to attack is not an action. </p>

<p>Q: When is Hoseki, the Ninja Mystic, treated as a ninja, and when is she treated as a
shugenja?</p>

<p>A: When she &quot;casts&quot; her spell, she performs a ninja action instead, but the
spell is always a spell, and anything it does to &quot;this shugenja&quot; will affect
her. Doom of the Phoenix destroys the spell, Black Scrolls corrupt her, spells that
destroy their caster destroy her, and so on. She also needs to use actual shugenja, not
other Mystics, if she wants help casting Rituals. &quot;Those darn ninjas. They're
wacky.&quot; - The Tick, issue #3 Section Six: Cards. &quot;Oops.&quot; I've taken the
bulk of this section out and combined it with the Text Change &amp; Errata List, which
should be available from the same site where you got this FAQ (if it's not, please ask the
site's maintainer to add it). I'll only mention the latest errata here. Emerald Edition
cards: Hida Kisada: Is no longer immune to the effects of untargetted spells and innate
abilities. Naka Kuro: He can only copy Elemental actions, not any Elemental effect.
Forbidden Knowledge cards: Ancestral Sword of Hantei: Its stat-switching effect does not
apply to focussing. Shadowlands cards: </p>

<p>Q: I've noticed a lot of minor differences between the semi-sorted Personalities in my
Shadowlands Clan Decks and the ones I got in Destiny Packs. Do these all get played as
written? </p>

<p>A: Sigh... Yes. However, two of these cards have since been reprinted in later sets and
no longer have variants. The Mountain Goblin always has a Personal Honor of 1. Shosuro
Taberu always has a gold cost of <8> and a clear reminder that his ability is Politicaln.
Corrupted Iron Mine: this card does not count as an &quot;Iron Mine&quot; card with
respect to increasing the gold production of Blacksmiths. It will just give a -1g penalty,
and not a +1g bonus as well. It also no longer reduces the Blacksmith's second value of 4g
for weapons and armor.<br>
Forbidden Knowledge cards: Seikua: now only gains +1/+1 per Ring.<br>
Crimson &amp; Jade cards: Peasant Levies, Tokiuji: These cards should have the Ashigarun
trait. Mounts: This card should have the Cavalryn and Creaturen traits. Oni no Genso: This
card should have the Nonhumann trait. Genzo: Should not refer to himself as
&quot;Norio&quot;. Also, the following three Personalities have lost the Unaligned trait
and acquired the Yoritomo's Alliance trait: Kemmei Moshi Wakiza Tsuruchi<br>
Promotional cards: Promotional cards, like all cards, get played by their most recent
wording (p. 65). Any promo card which underwent a spelling fix or minor title change is
considered the same card as its Emerald Edition counterpart. For the most part, the
correlation will be obvious. Two that might not be are Inversion of Energies, which is
considered the same card as Energy Transference, and Motto Seiki, who is considered the
same as Yotsu Seiki. Matsu Turi is not a distinct card. He is played as Matsu Gohei.</p>

_Legend of the Five Rings_(tm) Text Change &amp; Errata List Version 2.0 / June 3rd, 1997
This list summarizes all play-affecting changes due to the Most- Recent-Version Rule and
all errata which have been issued over the course of the various expansions. Those

<p>Moat Clarified: -1F penalty only lasts while the attack is in progress.</p>

for play and deck construction purposes. </p>

Fire&quot; for play and deck construction purposes. </p>

<p>PERSONALITIES</p>

<p>Agasha Tamori Added: +3C bonus also applies when bringing spells into play. </p>

refused. </p>

<p>Ashlim Errata: The removal of the Shadowlands trait is permanent. </p>

<p>Doji Hoturi Clarified: focussing adds to Personal Honor if he makes a duel a Duel of
