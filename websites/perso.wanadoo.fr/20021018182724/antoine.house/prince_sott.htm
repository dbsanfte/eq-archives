Oh yeah</p>

<p>In France a skinny man<br>
Died of a big disease with a little name<br>
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle<br>
And soon she did the same<br>
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys<br>
And their idea of fun<br>
Is being in a gang called The Disciples<br>
High on crack, totin' a machine gun</p>

Unless a man truly dies<br>
Oh why<br>
Time, time</p>

<p>Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly<br>
Neighbors just shine it on<br>
But if a night falls and a bomb falls<br>
Will anybody see the dawn<br>
Time, times</p>

<p>@SONG: Dorothy Parker</p>

<p>Dorothy Parker&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Controversy Music, ASCAP - 1987]<br>
--------------<br>
Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade<br>
She worked the night shift<br>
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine<br>
She got a lot of tips<br>
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff<br>
In a violent room<br>
Fighting with lovers past<br>
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine<br>
Dorothy was fast<br>
Well, I ordered - &quot;Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't 2 hungry&quot;<br>
Dorothy laughed<br>
She said &quot;Sounds like a real man 2 me&quot;<br>
Kinda cute, U wanna take a bath?<br>
(do you wanna, do you wanna, bath)<br>
I said &quot;Cool, but I'm leaving my pants on&quot; (she say)<br>
&quot;Cuz I'm kind of going with someone&quot;<br>
She said &quot;Sounds like a real man 2 me&quot;<br>
&quot;Mind if I turn on the radio?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, my favorite song&quot; she said<br>
And it was Joni singing &quot;Help me I think I'm falling&quot;<br>
(Ring)<br>
The phone rang and she said<br>
&quot;Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U&quot;<br>
Right then I knew I was through<br>
(Dorothy Parker was cool)</p>

<p>My pants where wet, they came off<br>
But she didn't see the movie<br>
Cuz she hadn't read the book first<br>
Instead she pretended she was blind<br>
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse<br>
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha)<br>
I felt much better so I went back <br>
2 the violent room (tell us what U did)<br>
Let me tell U what I did...</p>

<p>I took another bubble bath with my pants on<br>
All the fighting stopped<br>
Next time I'll do it sooner<br>
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker</p>

Well<br>

It was 7:45 we were all in line<br>
2 greet the teacher Miss Cathleen<br>
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me<br>
All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose<br>
She always stood at the back of the line<br>

<p>Cynthia wore the prettiest dress<br>

Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around<br>
Lucy cried, I almost died, U know what we found?</p>

<p>When we be makin' love<br>
I only hear the sounds<br>
Heavenly angels cryin' up above<br>
Tears of joy pourin' down on us<br>
They know we need each other<br>
They know U are my fix<br>
I know, that U know that I ain't cheatin' baby<br>
They know this is serious<br>
I ain't funkin' just 4 kicks, no<br>
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby<br>
U could say that I'm a terminal case<br>
U could burn up my clothes<br>
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride<br>
But I got 2 have your face<br>
All up in the place<br>
I'd like 2 think that I'm a man of exquisite taste<br>
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace<br>
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' baby could compare<br>
2 your lovely face<br>
Do U know what I'm sayin' 2 ya this evening<br>
I'm just tryin' 2 say<br>
I'm just tryin' 2 say<br>
That until, until the end of time<br>
I'll be there 4 U<br>
I'll be there 4 U<br>
On my heart, on my mind,&nbsp;&nbsp; (truly adore U)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I truly adore U &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(darlin')<br>
U don't know what you're mean 2 me<br>
Baby, (until the end of time)<br>
Baby, (I'll be there 4 U)<br>
Baby, (U own my heart and mind)<br>
'Til the end of time I'll be there 4 U<br>
(I truly adore U)<br>
Adore U&nbsp; (adore U)</p>

<p>Can I talk 2 U?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{chorus
repeated in background}}<br>
Tell U what U mean 2 me<br>
Every time U wander<br>
I'll be your eyes so U can see<br>
I wanna show U things<br>
That I show no other, I wanna be<br>
More than, more than your mother<br>
More than your brother<br>
I wanna be (like no) like no other<br>
If U need me, I'll never leave<br>
I know, that U know, without U there is no me<br>
There is no me<br>
Without U there is no sea<br>
There is no shore<br>
Love is 2 weak 2 define how much I adore<br>
U, child<br>
U, child<br>
The last words U hear<br>
The last words U hear</p>
