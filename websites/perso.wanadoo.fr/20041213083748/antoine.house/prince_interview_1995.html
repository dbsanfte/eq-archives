  <strong>My Name Isn't Prince, <br>
  And I Am Flunky </strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Andy Richardson</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">March 1, 1995. 
  A stretch black limousine is purring gently in a London car park. Two young 
  men stand nearby, pressing their faces against a high steel fence that is dwarfed 
  by the neighboring twin towers of Wembley Stadium. They talk in quick voices, 
  check their watches and anxiously wait for a glimpse of their hero. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the limousine 
  door opens. they pull harder on the railings but then a large hand reaches down. 
  I think it's time both of you left now,&quot; booms a deep voice. They turn 
  around and stare into the eyes of the security man. Momentarily, they are confused. 
  Then they hear the thud of the limousine door. They spin around, their hearts 
  sink when they realize it's too late. The man they were waiting to see has gone. 
  Beyond the gates lie a connection of executive cars, a swish coach with tinted-glass 
  windows and an open door that leads to the belly of Wembley Arena four people 
  venture past the door, step over miles of black cable, past the naked mannequin 
  which lies on top of a flight case and walk towards a dimly-lit corridor blocked 
  by two sharp suited guards. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suddenly a small 
  man appears from behind a grey door. He is wearing a long velvet coat and eating 
  bread wrapped in a pink napkin. As the foursome step a little closer, they recognize 
  the wire thin moustache, immaculate black hair, huge brown eyes and elegant 
  gold jewelry. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who are these the 
  diminutive star demands, glimpsing the people who have crossed his no-go threshold. 
  His publicist explains they are journalists. The superstar nods approval and 
  then climbs a set of stairs to the Wembley Arena stage. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'll see 
  you in a minute,&quot; he says, and then disappears from view. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rewind to December 
  1994. The Artist Formerly Known As Prince is locked in conversation with his 
  publicist. He is talking about his on-going battle with his record company, 
  Warner Bros. Music, his new, unreleased album, The Gold Experience', and his 
  forthcoming world tour. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He is asking what 
  people think of him. What people expect of a multimillion dollar megastar who 
  is preparing for an unequaled four-year world tour. Do the public want him to 
  break his legendary silence? To talk about his music, dispel the myths and explain 
  why he killed the artist known as Prince? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Do you think 
  I should do interviews again?&quot; he asks, though in his mind he has decided 
  the answer is yes. His publicist says he should talk, explaining that being 
  remote is an '80s thing and the public expect to hear from their heroes. &quot;Even 
  Michael Jackson has done a TV interview,&quot; the publicist adds. I think you 
  should.&quot; Fast forward to February 20, 1995, and Prince and his publicist 
  are sharing a table at the UK Brit Awards. Their $350-a-head seats are just 
  a few feet from the official Warner Bros. table, which both men snub, and TAFKAP/0{+&gt; 
  has written 'SLAVE' on his right cheek. The word is an apparent protest at his 
  record company's refusal to issue a backlog of albums which he has made Eventually 
  he leaves his table and makes his way to the stage to receive his award as best 
  international male artist. Once there he makes a typically elliptical speech: 
  &quot;Prince best, Gold experience better. Get Wild. In concert free. On record 
  slave. Peace.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assembled guests 
  quietly mock him, wondering how a man who signed a $100 million record deal 
  could consider himself a 'slave'. Worse still Dave Rowntree of Blur, has scribbled 
  the word 'Dave' on his cheek, and it is Dave, not 0{+&gt;, who'll make the morning 
  headlines. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'll talk,&quot; 
  says 0{+&gt; as the night wears on. &quot;I'll talk before the tour.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two days before 
  the tour and 0{+&gt; is rehearsing his band into the ground. Wembley Arena has 
  been fitted with his $250,000 'Endorphinmachine' - a stage set mimicking the 
  human endorphin glands which produce morphine like hormones - and 0{+&gt; has 
  been working his band until 2am each night, by which time he is too tired to 
  continue. He has been in London for a week practicing, partying and watching 
  Eric Clapton at the Albert Hall and fake lesbian group Fem 2 Fem at the London 
  Astoria. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, though, 
  his thoughts center on the launch of his gargantuan tour. It'll end in New York 
  In 1998,&quot; he says later. &quot;We've already booked Madison Square Garden 
  for the final date. We're bringing all our friends. It will be special.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt;'s entourage 
  is vast. There are five bodyguards stationed outside his dressing room door; 
  all of them well dressed and wearing small brown earphones that link them to 
  a production room. One sports a six-inch scar from his ear to his chin, another 
  drips with expensive jewelry a third has a skinhead crop, immaculately pressed 
  suit and piercing eyes that say &quot;Don't even think about it.&quot; Outside 
  the dressing room is a long corridor with white walls and a blue rubberized 
  floor. It leads to six rooms where his dancers and backing band are busying 
  themselves in make-up rooms. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His room is surprisingly 
  small; the size of an average front room in a terraced house. Against one wall 
  there is a vast mirror and a table top which holds oranges, bread, china cups 
  and saucers, an ordinary electric kettle and an abundance of candles. There 
  are two sprawling house pants in the corners of the room, a medium- sized table 
  in the center and two large leather sofas which are covered in purple, red and 
  green velvet drapes. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Inevitably, there 
  Is a huge TV/stereo in one corner, with two large speakers on the floor. And 
  built into one wall are two sliding double doors which lead into 0{+&gt;'s personal 
  changing room; a space bedecked with mirrors and innumerable hair sprays, moisturizers, 
  restless of makeup and bottles of cologne. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; is sitting 
  in the center of the one of the sofas with the word 'Slave' written on his left 
  cheek. He is dressed in a blue all-in-one which is cut to the waist revealing 
  his taut, lean physique He wears blue suede ankle boots, chunky black wraparound 
  shades and a gold necklace with coin- like circles that hang into his chest. 
  His publicist leaves the room, the boom of the rehearsal disappears as the door 
  closes and 0{+&gt; relaxes into his seat. Finally, it's time to talk... </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The BIG issue for 
  0{+&gt; is his recording contract with Warner Bros. It demands four new albums 
  at a rate of no more than one a year. The record company, ideally, would like 
  to release one LP every two or three years to ensure maximum sales. With 0{+&gt;'s 
  cooperation, it would release a single, an album, and then further singles and 
  watch as the records reached the ten-million-plus sales of 'Purple Rain'. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt;, however 
  would like to release one LP every six months to keep up with his prolific songwriting 
  and recording output, or maybe even more. He sits on the board of WB and the 
  2 sides have tried many times to reach an agreement. But on every occasion the 
  talks breaks down. Now he wants out. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There's a brilliant 
  Prince and the NPG album waiting to be released, he says, but WB won't release 
  it. &quot;See, if they give me control and let me release this (holds up the 
  GE) then Madonna would be straight in wanting the same.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'd like 
  to put out 700,000 copies of some blues guitar music with a guitar magazine 
  but WB don't let me. I'd give away a single with just the A-side and tell people 
  to come back next year and buy the b-side. Record companies are run by men who 
  think they run America. They think they're the smartest but they're not. They 
  don't know what's going on in my mind.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; says he 
  can release music on the Internet. When it's suggested that most people cannot 
  get access to the Internet he says &quot;we'll fix it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Once the 
  Internet is a reality the music business is finished. There won't be any need 
  for record companies. if I can send you my music direct. what's point of having 
  a music business?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His main bugbear 
  with Warners is that they don't understand. He repeats he doesn't mind the situation 
  and says the problem has had no effect on his ability to write and record. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In simple terms, 
  it's not something that gets him down. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They don't 
  understand me. I understand them. I'll just give there one album every year 
  for the next four years. I'm not going to take them to court and the stories 
  saying I will have just been made up. I won't do that. I could give them four 
  albums tomorrow but they don't want that.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what will you 
  do while you're waiting for your contract to expire in 1998? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm going 
  to say on the road until the contract ends. I've already booked a show for Madison 
  Square Garden in 1998. We're going to get loads of people down there. I can 
  keep touring until then. I love being on stage, I love touring and I'm strong 
  enough. I never get tired.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; says one 
  of his reasons for breaking his silence is to make sure young musicians don't 
  ever experience the contract war he has become embroiled in. &quot;I want to 
  help young musicians. I don't want people to be in the same position. I've been 
  doing this for 16 years now, I know how it works. A manager knows thinks when 
  you start out that he ain't gonna tell you because it isn't in his interests. 
  He's only gonna tell you the things he wants you to know. You understand what 
  I'm saying? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But I'm not 
  bitter. I'm not angry. Mo Austin (Warners boss) gave me the Most Beautiful Girl 
  In The World' to release as 0{+&gt;. And I will love that man forever because 
  of that. I don't have a problem with Warners. I'm content with them.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So why do you scrawl 
  that slogan across your face? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Because I 
  am a slave to the truth. It's there to remind myself. I'm not a slave to Warner 
  Brothers. It's not there to embarrass Warners - why would I do that? You gotta 
  understand that. I don't need to. It's not about that. I'm not angry with them. 
  It's just there as a reminder.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; is animated 
  when he talks about his contract. He sits forward on the edge of his sofa, his 
  hands wave about in the air, he is imploring the world to listen. He also knows 
  that there is no quick legal fix to beat Warner. American contract law is far 
  more stringent than that in the UK and he has seen what happened to George Michael: 
  a costly legal battle which ended in defeat and which could now take up to five 
  years to resolve. (If Michael is to overturn his judgement tying him to Sony 
  Music, his only hope is a victory in the European Courts. But before that he 
  would face probable and costly legal defeats in the Court Of Appeal and the 
  House of Lords.) </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I've seen 
  what happened with that case,&quot; 0{+&gt; adds. &quot;And I don't want to 
  go down the George Michael road.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Face to face, 0{+&gt; 
  is far removed from the unworldly public image built around him steadily since 
  his recording career began in 1978. It is difficult to equate the man sitting 
  on the sofa with the pop star who apparently dreams of reincarnation as a dolphin, 
  who inspires national radio polls in Australia - where the nation wants to name 
  him 'Davo' (an affectionate, if unimaginative, colloquial nickname for people 
  called, er, Dave and who mumbles 'Thank You, God' acceptance speeches at major 
  awards. His dressing room is essentially a slightly tacky boudoir with a cheap-looking 
  rug that could have been bought from IKEA for $35. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So does it worry 
  you that people think you are mad? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No,&quot; 
  he laughs, crumpling into the sofa in a heap. &quot;I don't care. If people 
  think I'm insane, fine. I want people to think I'm insane. But I'm in control. 
  It was different before I became this (points to the 0{+&gt; on the cover of 
  'The Gold Experience'). I didn't have control. I didn't know what was happening 
  beyond the next two albums. But now I know exactly what the next two albums 
  will be. I'm not playing anyone else's game. I'm in control. I don't care if 
  people say I'm mad. It don't matter.&quot; But if your sanity is intact, why 
  did you change your name from Prince to 0{+&gt;? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I got a whole 
  new mindset when I became 0{+&gt;. I can't explain how I feel now compared to 
  then. I don't want to destroy the mystique by revealing everything. And if people 
  come to see me just to hear 'Purple Rain' then I'm sorry. I'm playing these 
  (0{+&gt;) songs now. I'll play Prince songs occasionally. I just want people 
  to understand who I am. See, you could go away and tell people I am stupid. 
  I just want you to help me I want people to understand The only thing I care 
  about is your journalistic ability. Your ability to articulate.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if you're so 
  keen to let people understand you, why won't you let journalists take notes 
  or record their interviews with you? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You don't 
  need to do that. The mind is perfect.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mind isn't 
  perfect! </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;You will 
  only remember the things that are important.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a knock 
  on the door. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 20 minutes 
  is nearly up and there is an abundance of questions still unasked. But 0{+&gt; 
  is happy, he's jovial, falling about on the sofa and making the points he wants 
  to make. His publicist stands at the door and is motioned away by the small 
  one's left hand. &quot;A few more minutes,&quot; he says. And again we are alone. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So tell me about 
  your vices. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What's a 
  vice?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A habit that can 
  be self-destructive. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I don't know 
  about those.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well how about 
  your obsession with sex? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mood stiffens 
  and 0{+&gt; slaps his boot in apparent agitation He refuses to say whether he 
  slept with Kylie Minogue (as it was rumored) or his dancer Mayte Garcia. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I won't use 
  the word 'sex' and I won't use the word 'beauty'. Those are two I can't use 
  because people have different tastes and they ask you what kind of sex you have.&quot; 
  Again, 0{+&gt; falls over in the chair laughing and clapping his hands together. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What about drugs? 
  Do you take drugs? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I'm interested 
  in all experiences.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Can I take that 
  as a yes? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I didn't 
  say that. I don't think people are interested. I'm not interested if you take 
  drugs. I think we'd better chill it there.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But you're an icon. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; stops laughing. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What did 
  you say?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said, a lot of 
  people see you as an icon. There's only a handful of people in the world in 
  your position. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I don't see 
  myself as an icon. I don't see that. Do people care if I take drugs? People 
  aren't interested in me. I didn't put myself on a pedestal. If I'm on a pedestal 
  it's because other people have put me there.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you feel anything 
  for a person like Michael Jackson? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I could talk 
  to you about Michael Jackson but I would just be doing the job that a journalist 
  does so there's no point. I met Michael, if other people talked then he'd say 
  something that would tear the house down from what everyone else would say anyway.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout the 
  interview 0{+&gt; has been wearing shades. I ask him to take them off, trying 
  to reason they are defensive and they make it easy for him to hide. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;OK,&quot; 
  he says, and lowers them to the bridge of his nose. &quot;I'm only wearing them 
  because I'm tired. My eyes are red. It's because we've been rehearsing. It's 
  just to protect my eyes,&quot; and then he puts them back on. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you ever relax? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;No.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you wish you 
  could? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Yes.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do you try? 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And suddenly 0{+&gt;'s 
  veneer dissolves. He no longer appears as the invincible round-the-clock superstar. 
  He lowers his voice, sits upright at the front of his sofa and looks to the 
  floor. He Is suddenly fallible. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The only 
  time you can get tranquil is when you are at one. And the only time that happens 
  is when you are with God I do that sometimes. When I'm like that I'm not happy. 
  He tells me to carry on doing what I'm doing, which is my music. I'm always 
  happy I'm never sad I never slow down. I'm constantly occupied with music.&quot; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And what about 
  ? </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Look, they're 
  calling me. I've got to get back to rehearsal.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interview over, 
  0{+&gt; refuses a direct request for a follow-up conversation tomorrow - five 
  journalists huddle around a table in a room marked 'Catering'. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They chain smoke 
  each other's cigarettes, desperately scanning their memories trying to recall 
  every quote from their individual interviews. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One talks about 
  how strange and detached from reality the whole situation was &quot;It's difficult 
  to remember everything. I was just sitting there thinking. 'I'll have to remember 
  this', and impossible!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Across a table, 
  a group of American roadies are talking to their two English counterparts about 
  bubbly beer, the strongest coffee in the world and the number of drive-by shootings 
  in the USA. A member of 0{+&gt;'s crew walks in, scans the room, exclaims, &quot;Oh 
  shit,&quot; and walks out. In the dressing rooms and wardrobe areas five people 
  walk by dressed as devils or in skimpy dresses. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And then the journalists 
  are returned to 0{+&gt;'s now-empty dressing room to listen to 'The Gold Experience' 
  LP in the company of his bodyguard. Two women walk in and head straight for 
  his changing room to re-stock the cosmetics and his publicist returns, sits 
  on the floor and shakes his head in awe of the new album. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we leave, 0{+&gt; 
  is still rehearsing on the vast Wembley stage and we leave with impressions 
  of a control freak who has banished really from his life in his quest for invincibility 
  A man with a paranoia so deep- seated that he killed his own identity and refuses 
  to recognize the name - Prince Rogers Nelson with which he was born.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And a man who is 
  a creative and commercial colossus who considers himself no more than a slave.
