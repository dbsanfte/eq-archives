<h6>Somebody recently posted that there was an interesting New York Times<br>
article and simply gave an incomplete URL (www.nytimes.com) and an<br>
instruction to 'search for prince'. The actual pointer is:<br>
http://search.nytimes.com/web/docsroot/yr/mo/day/artleisure/17pare.html<br>
<br>
Unfortunately one has to go through the hassle of registering to use<br>
the site, and since this is a private list, perhaps the actual text<br>
will be welcomed here. It's generally better practice to simply point<br>
to the article (with complete URL of course), but I can't see making<br>
everyone from the list interested in the article go register just to<br>
see the silly thing. Definately don't re-post it anywhere public<br>
however. I know for my part about the last thing in the world I want<br>
to see is some layman's opinion of o(-&gt;'s work, balanced with cryptic<br>
posts from people who seem to enjoy thinking they have some 'secret'<br>
information they can't manage to share with anyone. Touche.<br>

[C] HANHASSEN, Minn.-- Paisley Park, the studio complex Prince built<br>
in this Minneapolis suburb, is abuzz. On a 10,000-square-foot sound stage,<br>
workmen are rolling white paint onto a huge runway of a set, preparing it for<br>
a video shoot later in the day. In a mirrored studio down the hall, two dozen<br>
dancers are rehearsing. Upstairs, an Olympic gymnast, Dominique Dawes, is<br>
trying on a wispy lavender costume. A sound engineer is editing a promotional<br>
CD; a graphics artist is putting the final touches on a logo. Through it all<br>
strolls the man in charge, attentive to every detail. A hole in the gymnast's<br>
leotard? A bit of choreography that needs broadening? As songwriter, video<br>
director and record-company head, he takes responsibility for everything,<br>
makes all the final decisions and couldn't be happier about it.<br>
<br>
The 38-year-old musician who now writes his name as a glyph is<br>
gearing up for the release on Tuesday of &quot;Emancipation,&quot; a three-CD, 36-song,<br>
three-hour album intended to return him to superstardom. Over a recording<br>
career that stretches nearly two decades, the musician who was born Prince<br>
Rogers Nelson earned a reputation for unorthodox behavior long before he<br>
dropped his name. Just in time for the music-video explosion, he invented<br>
himself as a larger-than-life figure: a doe-eyed all-purpose seducer for whom<br>
the erotic and the sacred were never far apart. Outlandish clothes,<br>
sculptured hair and see-through pants made Prince a vivid presence, but<br>
behind the costumes was one of the most influential songwriters of the<br>
1980's.<br>
<br>
He toyed with every duality he could think of : masculine and<br>
feminine, black and white, straight and gay. While he made albums virtually<br>
by himself, like an introvert, his concerts were in the grand extroverted<br>
tradition of rhythm-and-blues showmen like James Brown. His music pulled<br>
together rock and funk, gospel and jazz, pop ballads and 12-bar blues. His<br>
most distinctive rhythm -- a choppy, keyboard-driven funk -- has permeated<br>
pop, hip-hop and dance music, while his ballad style echoes in hits like<br>
TLC's &quot;Waterfalls.&quot;<br>
<br>
His only guide seemed to be a musicianship that drew admiration from<br>
many camps. Peter Sellars, the revisionist opera director, once compared<br>
Prince to Mozart for his abundant creativity. Yet for much of the 1990's, the<br>
quality of his output has sagged -- a result, he says, of his deteriorating<br>
relationship with his longtime record company, Warner Brothers.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's one of the greatest ones,&quot; says George Clinton, himself an<br>
architect of modern funk. &quot;He's a hell of a musician; he has really studied<br>
everything. And he's working all the time. Even when he's jamming he's<br>
recording that. He gets to party; he listens to everything on the radio; he<br>
goes out to clubs, and then he goes to the studio and stays up the rest of<br>
the night working. He has more stuff recorded than anybody gets to hear.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes I think he puts too much effort into trying to take<br>
what's out now and put his own thing on it. To me, ain't none of the pop<br>
stuff happening that's half as good as what he can do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Emancipation&quot; is a make-or-break album. It will inaugurate a new<br>
recording deal with a gambit that may turn out to be bold and innovative or<br>
utterly foolhardy; will the 3-CD set be received as an act of generosity or a<br>
glut of material? For a major performer in the 1990's, releasing a three-CD<br>
set of new material is unprecedented; even double albums are rare and<br>
commercially risky. And &quot;Emancipation&quot; is financed and marketed by the<br>
songwriter himself. &quot;All the stakes are higher,&quot; he says as he picks a few<br>
berries from a plate of zabaglione in the Paisley Park kitchen. &quot;But I'm in a<br>
situation where I can do anything I want.&quot;<br>
<br>
His day's project is to direct the video for the first single from<br>
&quot;Emancipation,&quot; a remake of the Stylistics' 1972 hit &quot;Betcha by Golly,
Wow.&quot;<br>
At the same time, he's making last-minute marketing decisions and doing a<br>
rare interview. Ever the clotheshorse, he's wearing a long, nubby gray-and-<br>
black sweater and a shirt with lace tights. A chevron is shaved into his hair<br>
next to one ear, with glitter applied to it. Clear-eyed and serious, he<br>
speaks in a low voice, in a conversation that veers between hard-headed<br>
practicality, flashes of eccentricity and professions of faith in God. He is<br>
businesslike one moment; the next, he invokes his self-made spirituality, in<br>
which musical inspiration and carnality are both links to divine creativity.<br>
<br>
For all the music he has put out since the first Prince album in<br>
1978, he has remained private. The songs on &quot;Emancipation&quot; take up his usual<br>
topics -- sex, salvation, partying all night long -- along with new ones like<br>
cruising the Internet. But a few have hints of the personal. On Valentine's<br>
Day he married Mayte Garcia, who had been a backup singer and dancer in his<br>
band. A few months ago, he announced that she was pregnant and that the child<br>
was due in November. Since then he has refused further comment. &quot;I'm never<br>
going to release details about children,&quot; he says. &quot;They'll probably name<br>
themselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
----------------------------- On the album, he<br>
An 80's pop icon, the music proposes marriage in<br>
star once known as Prince, &quot;The Holy River,&quot; a<br>
at 38, is banking on a 3-D rolling midtempo song<br>
set to restore luster to his akin to Bruce<br>
name (or glyph) in the 90's. Springsteen's quieter<br>
side. Later, a sparse,<br>
----------------------------- tender piano ballad<br>
begs, &quot;Let's Have a Baby.&quot; Asked about that song, he talks about the<br>
couple's wedding night. &quot;I carried her across the threshold and gave her many<br>
presents,&quot; he says. &quot;The last one was a crib. And we both cried. She got down<br>
on her knees in that gown, and I did next to her, and we thanked God that we<br>
could be alive for this moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marrying Mayte, he says, seemed inevitable. Her middle name is<br>
Jannelle; his father is John L. Her mother's name was Nell; he was born<br>
Prince Rogers Nelson : &quot;Nell's son,&quot; he says. &quot;Am I going to argue with all<br>
these coincidences?&quot; he asks, at least half seriously. Like a man in love, he<br>
adds: &quot;She really makes my soul feel complete. I feel powerful with her<br>
around. And she makes it easier to talk to God.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Emancipation&quot; includes shimmering ballads and fuzz-edged rockers,<br>
bump-and-grind bass grooves and a big-band two-beat, Latin-jazz jams, and<br>
dissonant electronic dance tracks. &quot;People will say it's sprawling and it's<br>
all over the place,&quot; he says. &quot;That's fine. I play a lot of styles. This is<br>
not arrogance; this is the truth. Because anything you do all day long,<br>
you're going to master after a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
On the new album, keys change and rhythms metamorphose at whim. One<br>
tour de force, &quot;Joint 2 Joint,&quot; moves through five different grooves and ends<br>
with all its riffs fitting together. The seeming spontaneity is more<br>
remarkable because nearly all the instruments are played by the songwriter<br>
himself. The toil of constructing songs track by track is worth it, he says,<br>
for the unanimity it brings. &quot;Because I do all the instruments, I'm injecting<br>
the joy I feel into all those 'players.' The same exuberant soul speaks<br>
through all the instruments.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I always wanted to make a three-record set,&quot; he adds. &quot; 'Sign o'<br>
the Times' was originally supposed to be a triple album, but it ended up as a<br>
double. For this one, I started with the blueprint of three CD's, one hour<br>
each, with peaks and valleys in the right places. I just filled in the<br>
blueprint.&quot;<br>
<br>
[W] hile most songwriters are hard-pressed to come up with enough<br>
worthwhile material for an album a year, he has never had that problem. He<br>
can't stop writing music; his backlog includes at least a thousand unreleased<br>
songs and compositions, and new ones are constantly pouring out, all mapped<br>
in his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;You hear it done,&quot; he says. &quot;You see the dancing; you hear the<br>
singing. When you hear it, you either argue with that voice or you don't.<br>
That's when you seek God. Sometimes ideas are coming so fast that I have to<br>
stop doing one song to get another. But I don't forget the first one. If it<br>
works, it will always be there. It's like the truth: it will find you and<br>
lift you up. And if it ain't right, it will dissolve like sand on the beach.&quot;<br>
<br>
Commercially, &quot;Emancipation&quot; hedges its bets. There are<br>
straightforward groove songs and lush slow-dance tunes alongside the more<br>
idiosyncratic cuts, and there are remakes of other people's hits, including<br>
&quot;One of Us&quot; from Joan Osborne and &quot;La, La (Means I Love You)&quot; from the<br>
Delfonics. An associate producer, Kirk A. Johnson, punched up the rhythm<br>
tracks, giving some of them the crunch of hip-hop.<br>
<br>
The album is priced under $30, like a two-CD set. &quot;Emancipation&quot;,<br>
produced by the performer's own label, NPG Records, is his first album to be<br>
distributed by EMI. The album title is a pointed reference to the end of the<br>
reported six-album deal, potentially worth $100 million, that he made in 1992<br>
with Warner Brothers. He had been making albums for the label since 1978 and<br>
sold millions of copies in the 1980's; the soundtrack for his 1984 movie,<br>
&quot;Purple Rain,&quot; sold more than 10 million copies. He continued to release No.1<br>
singles as late as 1991, with &quot;Cream.&quot;<br>
<br>
But once Warner Brothers had committed such a large investment, the<br>
label wanted to apply proven hit-making strategies: putting out just one<br>
album a year, packing it with potential singles, issuing various trendy<br>
remixes of songs and following the advice of in-house experts on promotion<br>
and marketing. Rationing and editing his work grated on Prince, and he began<br>
wrangling with Warner Brothers over control of his career.<br>
<br>
&quot;The music, for me, doesn't come on a schedule,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't<br>
know when it's going to come, and when it does, I want it out. Music was<br>
created to uplift the soul and to help people make the best of a bad<br>
situation. When you sit down to write something, there should be no<br>
guidelines. The main idea is not supposed to be, 'How many different ways can<br>
we sell it?' That's so far away from the true spirit of what music is. Music<br>
starts free, with just a spark of inspiration. When limits are set by another<br>
party that walks into the ball game afterward, that's fighting inspiration.<br>
<br>
[T] he big deal we had made together wasn't working,&quot; he says of<br>
Warner Brothers. &quot;They are what they are, and I am what I am, and eventually<br>
I realized that those two systems aren't going to work together. The deeper<br>
you get into that well, the darker it becomes.&quot;<br>
<br>
In 1993, he adopted an unpronounceable glyph as his name, ignoring<br>
warnings that he was jettisoning the equivalent of a well-known trademark.<br>
His associates now refer to him as the Artist, a merciful shortening of the<br>
Artist Formerly Known as Prince. He knows the name change caused confusion<br>
and amusement, and he doesn't care. &quot;When the lights go down and the<br>
microphone goes on,&quot; he says, &quot;it doesn't matter what your name is.&quot;<br>
<br>
As an experiment, Warner Brothers gave him permission in 1994 to<br>
release a single, &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,&quot; through NPG Records<br>
on the independent Bellmark label. It was an international hit, further<br>
straining his relations with Warner Brothers. He began performing with the<br>
word &quot;slave&quot; written on his cheek. &quot;We never were angry; we were
puzzled,&quot;<br>
says Bob Merlis, senior vice president of Warner Brothers Records. &quot;He<br>
evinced great unhappiness at being here. He wanted to release more albums<br>
than his contract called for; he wanted a different contract, which ran<br>
contrary to good business practices. Eventually, we agreed that his vision<br>
and ours didn't coincide on how to release his output.&quot;<br>
<br>
----------------------------- People familiar with the<br>
'When the lights go down and Warners contract say<br>
the microphone goes on,' the that it called for<br>
musician says, 'it doesn't Warner Brothers to pay<br>
matter what your name is.' an advance for each<br>
album submitted and that<br>
----------------------------- speeding up the schedule<br>
and submitting more albums meant more payments in a shorter time.<br>
There were rumors of bankruptcy in Paisley Park, that the entertainment<br>
empire (which for a short time also included a Minneapolis nightclub, Glam<br>
Slam) was too expensive to maintain.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Warner Brothers agreed to end the contract. Warner<br>
Brothers still has rights to one album of previously unreleased material, and<br>
it owns the master recordings of the Prince back catalogue, a situation that<br>
rankles the performer. &quot;If you don't own your masters,&quot; he says, &quot;your
master<br>
owns you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Under the new arrangement, he finances all his albums and videos and<br>
puts them out when he wishes. He pays EMI to manufacture the albums, and the<br>
company provides its distribution system and overseas marketing clout. He<br>
describes EMI as &quot;hired hands, like calling a florist to deliver some flowers<br>
to my wife.&quot; (Other NPG albums, including his ballet score, &quot;Kamasutra,&quot;
and<br>
Mayte's debut album are for sale through a Web site : www.thedawn.com.)<br>
<br>
Once he explains his business arrangements, he shows a visitor<br>
through Paisley Park, which is the size of a small shopping mall. In the<br>
recording studio, a half-dozen guitars are lined up, each with specific<br>
qualities: the leopard-patterned one is &quot;good for funk&quot;; the glyph-shaped one<br>
is &quot;the most passionate.&quot; Paisley Park was once painted all white, inside and<br>
out, but after he got married he decided that the place needed some color.<br>
Now there are carpets with inset zodiac signs, a mural of a tropical<br>
waterfall behind the water fountain, walls of purple, gold and red and a<br>
smiley face in Mayte's office.<br>
<br>
Past a birdcage holding two white doves named Divinity and Majesty<br>
is his office. A photograph of Miles Davis and Charlie Parker is by his desk.<br>
He shows the visitor an inch-thick worldwide marketing plan, with sales<br>
targets and promotion strategies, just like an executive. But as he plays the<br>
album, he gets caught up in the music.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes I stand in awe of what I do myself,&quot; he says. &quot;I feel<br>
like a regular person, but I listen to this and wonder, where did it come<br>
from ? I believe definitely in the higher power that gave me this talent. If<br>
you could go in the studio alone and come out with that, you'd do it every<br>
day, wouldn't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a curse,&quot; he concludes. &quot;And it's a blessing.&quot;<br>
