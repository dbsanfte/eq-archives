<p>{crowd noise same as for &quot;Alphabet Street&quot;}</p>

<p>He like to frequent this club down up on 36th<br>
Pimps and thangs like 2 hang outside and cuss for kicks</p>

<p>Talking 2 no one in particular, they say &quot;the baddest I am tonight&quot;<br>
4 letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite.<br>
All the poets and the part time singers always hang inside<br>
live music from a band plays a song called &quot;Soul Psychodelicide&quot;.<br>
The song's a year long and had been playing 4 months when he<br>
walked into the place.<br>
No one seemed to care, an introverted this-is-it look on most of their faces.<br>
Up on the mic repeating 2 words, over and over again<br>
was this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the<br>
articulated manner in which she said them.<br>
These 2 words, a little bit behind the beat.<br>
I mean just enough 2 turn u on.<br>
4 everytime she said the words another one of his doubts were gone.</p>

<p>Should he try 2 rap with her? Should he stand and stare?<br>
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem 2 care.<br>
So over and over, she said the words til he could take no more, (no more)<br>
he dragged her from the stage and together they ran through the back door<br>
In the alley over by the curb he said tell me what's your name<br>
she only said the words again and it started to rain (rain, rain, rain)<br>
2 words falling between the drops and the moans of his condition<br>
holding someone is truly believing there's joy in repetition.<br>
There's joy in repetition.<br>
There's joy in repetition.<br>
There's joy in repetition.<br>
There's joy in repetition.<br>
She said love me, love me, what she say?<br>
she say love me, love me.<br>
Joy, why don't u love me baby, joy, why can't u love me baby<br>
joy, come on and love me baby, joy in repetition<br>
Alright, joy in repetition,<br>
Alright, joy in repetition,<br>
Alright, joy in repetition,<br>
Alright, joy, all my wishes add up to one<br>
Love me, joy, Love me, joy, Love me, joy<br>
Love me, Love me, joy, joy, joy in repetition<br>
joy, joy in repetition,<br>
joy, joy (love me) in repetition,<br>
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition<br>
joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again,<br>
joy, I'd like 2 go way up high and say, Love me, joy<br>
