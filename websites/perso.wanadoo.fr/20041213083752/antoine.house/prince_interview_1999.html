  <strong>The Artist Is Back -- But Dont Call It a Comeback</strong><br>
  <br>
  By ANTHONY DE CURTIS<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK -- The 
  artist formerly known as Prince leaned forward, pointed to my notebook and raised 
  his voice. &quot;I'm not going to be on 'Behind the Music,&quot;' he asserted. 
  &quot;Will you please say that?&quot; It's a demand in the guise of a question. 
  And he was laughing, but he was also dead serious.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not that the 
  Artist -- the tag by which he's come to be known, for convenience as much as 
  metaphoric resonance -- doesn't watch the popular VH1 series himself. As he 
  sat in a lounge at Electric Lady Sound Studios in Greenwich Village, he cited 
  chapter and verse of shows about Hammer, TLC and Lenny Kravitz -- all, significantly, 
  African-American artists who, like him, have had run-ins with the music industry. 
  It's just that he has no patience for the show's inevitable 12-step-derived 
  emotional arc: Performer enjoys huge success and gets ego-crazy; performer makes, 
  then ruefully acknowledges, enormous personal and professional mistakes; performer 
  makes amends and, chastened, moves on.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Artist, who 
  is now 41, views his life in nothing remotely like those terms. He may have 
  spent much of this decade engaged in an excruciatingly public battle to free 
  himself from Warner Brothers Records, the label that in 1992 negotiated a deal 
  with him that was reported to be worth as much as $100 million. He may have 
  disowned all the albums he made as Prince -- including such masterpieces as 
  &quot;Dirty Mind,&quot; &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and &quot;Sign 'O' the Times&quot; 
  -- and sworn that he will re-record his entire catalog to deprive Warner Brothers 
  of royalties. He may have painted the word &quot;slave&quot; on his face and 
  changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol. And, despite having once been 
  one of pop music's biggest stars, he may have spent the last three years releasing 
  music exclusively -- and extensively -- on his own independent label, NPG Records, 
  and through his Web site. &quot;I don't even know how many albums I've made 
  now,&quot; he said coolly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, all that may 
  be true, but the Artist is absolutely unrepentant. On Nov. 2 he will release 
  a new album, &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic,&quot; through an arrangement 
  with Arista Records. It is his first association with a major label since he 
  put out the three-CD set &quot;Emancipation&quot; (1996) through a similar agreement 
  with EMI Records, which subsequently went out of business. (Warner Brothers, 
  which dissolved its contract with the Artist in 1996, has also just released 
  an album of Prince outtakes titled &quot;The Vault . . . Old Friends 4 Sale.&quot; 
  The CD's notes include a disclaimer that the &quot;enclosed material . . . was 
  originally intended 4 private use only.&quot;) &quot;Rave&quot; will be introduced 
  at a listening party in New York for the international media -- and the Arista 
  sales force -- on Saturday. The first single, a powerful ballad called &quot;The 
  Greatest Romance Ever Sold,&quot; will be released on Sept. 22, and the Artist 
  will make a video to accompany it. &quot;I will be touring to promote this album 
  -- definitely,&quot; he said, and the tour will be extensive and international. 
  He tapped Gwen Stefani of No Doubt and the rapper Chuck D. for cameos on the 
  album. He has even announced that while he remains the Artist Formerly Known 
  as Prince, &quot;Rave,&quot; surprisingly enough, was produced by none other 
  than Prince.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Asked if these 
  developments signal a comeback of sorts, the Artist shot back, &quot;A comeback 
  from what?&quot; As far as he is concerned, his way of going about things has 
  not changed at all since his chart-dominating days of the mid-80's. &quot; 'We 
  want you to do this. We want you to do that' -- I've had people talk to me like 
  that. And loud,&quot; he said. &quot; 'Everybody has to answer to someone,' 
  they'd tell me.&quot; His sense of insult -- and, again, his voice -- rose. 
  &quot;I'd say, 'I answer to God, fool.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clive Davis, the 
  renowned founder and chief executive of Arista and a no-nonsense industry veteran, 
  is betting that &quot;Rave&quot; will please Mammon as well as God.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While he has supported 
  outsiders like the Grateful Dead and Patti Smith, Davis is best known as a hit 
  maker, a man with sharp commercial instincts and ambitions. Most recently, he 
  signed the guitarist Carlos Santana -- one of the Artist's idols -- to Arista, 
  helped produce his new album, &quot;Supernatural,&quot; and guided him to the 
  Top 10 for the first time in decades. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Typically, the 
  Artist professes no awareness of Davis' relationship with Santana or anything 
  else about Davis' career. &quot;I knew nothing about him,&quot; he said simply, 
  explaining that their meeting came about at the suggestion of L. Londell McMillan, 
  the Artist's business partner. &quot;But he knows me. We agreed that the album 
  is full of hits. It was just a question of whether or not we would agree on 
  how it should be put out.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And, the Artist 
  added, Davis &quot;agreed that I own the master tapes&quot; -- a crucial issue 
  in the Artist's war with Warner Brothers.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For his part, Davis 
  has long wanted to work with the Artist, and he is determined to make &quot;Rave&quot; 
  a success. Indeed, when Davis speaks about the Artist, &quot;rave&quot; is the 
  operative word. &quot;This is a poet, a renaissance man, an iconoclast,&quot; 
  Davis said. &quot;This is someone who is bringing the state of music further 
  and further along. I don't want to get involved in whether this is hype or not 
  -- the man is at the top of his form. He's coming back peak. I don't think it's 
  an accident that the album is produced by Prince. That says it right there.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But that says what, 
  exactly? Davis comes gently down to earth.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Look, you're 
  never going to pin him down on something like that,&quot; he said with a laugh. 
  &quot;He said with a twinkle in his eye that Prince has always been his favorite 
  producer, and he was the right person for this project. There certainly have 
  been hits associated with Prince. But whether it's the Artist Formerly Known 
  as or the production of Prince, it works.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be easy 
  to be skeptical about Davis' enthusiasm, but the undeniable fact is that, regardless 
  of his commercial fortunes, the Artist still holds a great degree of allure 
  among both executives and performers in the music industry. Label honchos often 
  take their ability to work successfully with eccentric artists as a point of 
  pride, and the Artist has no equal in that regard. Performers, meanwhile, view 
  him as the epitome of an artist's Artist, a man who creates whenever and however 
  the mood strikes him and who plays by nobody else's rules.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That the Artist 
  carries himself, both on stage and off, with instinctive rock-star hauteur doesn't 
  hurt either. &quot;He's splendid, he's sumptuous, oh my God, he's so striking,&quot; 
  said Ani DiFranco, another rebel artist, who plays guitar on one track on &quot;Rave.&quot; 
  &quot;Being someone who also lives in her own world and makes a ridiculous amount 
  of records, just to watch him work was fascinating. Any instrument he picks 
  up, he speaks through. He's an example of the ability to keep being inspired 
  by your life. Also, he's sexy. I certainly haven't been immune!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sheryl Crow also 
  appears on the new album, singing and playing harmonica on a ballad titled &quot;Baby 
  Knows.&quot; &quot;It's not only his ability to play so many instruments, it's 
  the level at which he plays them,&quot; said Ms. Crow of the Artist, who plays 
  virtually all the instruments on &quot;Rave.&quot; &quot;I've heard him play 
  piano like Chick Corea or Herbie Hancock, move over to bass and play like Larry 
  Graham, then play guitar like Jimi Hendrix or Buddy Guy. He's written some of 
  the most amazing songs ever. And the main impression I was left with is that 
  he really loves what he does.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dressed entirely 
  in black save for his yellow, ankle-length, high-heeled boots, the matching 
  gold trim on his beret and the gold pendant with the symbol that is his name 
  hanging around his neck, the Artist was putting the final touches on his album 
  at Electric Lady, which was built by Jimi Hendrix, another of his heroes. His 
  wife, Mayte, sat nearby. The Artist's distrust of contracts extends to their 
  marriage bonds, which they have mutually dissolved, though they remain a couple. 
  &quot;We read them over, and there were a lot things in there we didn't like,&quot; 
  the Artist casually explained, referring to the marriage documents they signed 
  in 1996. Any further consequences of that decision remain unspecified. Mayte 
  currently lives in Spain, while he continues to live in his hometown, Minneapolis.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At first the Artist 
  was reluctant to let me hear any of the album or even to reveal the titles of 
  the songs. &quot;I'm tripping on that; when I listen, I prefer not knowing what 
  the titles are,&quot; he said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, as I was 
  about to leave a couple of hours later, he asked, almost shyly: &quot;Would 
  you like to hear some of it? I'd hate to have you go without hitting you with 
  something.&quot; In the studio's control room, he played sections of four songs 
  at such crushing volume that a rubber fish sitting on top of a speaker fell 
  off because of the shaking. The Artist can't be still while the music is playing, 
  so every few seconds he came over and shouted commentary into my ear. He was 
  speaking as loudly as he could, but I could barely hear him.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One sentence came 
  through loud and clear, however. &quot;Tell me that's not a hit,&quot; he insisted 
  as the swelling choruses and Arabic scales of &quot;The Greatest Romance Ever 
  Sold&quot; washed over us. I turned to look at him. His chest was puffed out 
  and he was smiling. His hips and shoulders were moving. But in his dark eyes, 
  beneath the bravado, there was a vulnerability he refused to acknowledge, as 
  well as a hope that the answer would be what he needed to hear.</font></p>

  NPG Records has provided us with some feedback about the interview:</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NPG RECORDS on 
  behalf of 0{+&gt; would like 2 thank Anthony DeCurtis and the New York Times 
  4 allowing him a forum in which 2 speak. The article seemed well-intentioned, 
  although there's just a couple of things we'd like 2 clear up:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; never &quot;disowned 
  the music he made when he was known as Prince&quot;. In fact, in his intent 
  2 own the Prince legacy, 0{+&gt; is re-recording the catalog in its entirety.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; is not 
  &quot;trying 2 deprive Warner Brothers of royalties&quot;... If this is a side-effect 
  of his re-recording the catalog, then so be it, but by no means is this his 
  intention. And, in fact, he believes that the entire Prince catalog belongs 
  in his family's name, since he was its creator.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0{+&gt; never &quot;announced 
  that while he remains The Artist Formerly Known as Prince...&quot;. Once again, 
  this moniker is something created by the media. A simple remedy 4 this would 
  b 2 use his chosen symbol: 0{+&gt;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While Carlos Santana 
  has definitely influenced 0{+&gt;'s solo guitar style, he is by no means his 
  &quot;idol.&quot; This slot is reserved 4 all things spiritual.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The estate in Spain 
  was purchased by The New Power Generation and serves as a residence 4 all its 
  members. 0{+&gt; never specifies where he lives. <br>
  Thank u again, Mr DeCurtis. The doors of Paisley Park r always open 2 u.</font></p>
