If we are a big family there should be no secrets, maybe a section that we can't post in (ie. if you are voting kicking someone out of the guild due to reasons) or whatever, but if someone wants to whine I think we should know about it.  Why go in secret and say something bring it out in the open, maybe others have the same concerns.  Maybe then the family could communicate as a whole.<br><br>Just like back in the days with Barroom Heroes, our old fearless leader back then used to get all kinds of complaints via tells and emails.  Wonder what would happen if the officers signed onto their own section and let us know what others are complaining about.   ie.  I got an email from Eltanko he said the following...  or should we even bother officers via email.  Since we have a great place to post right here.<br><br>Not to point any fingers, but from time to time I hear Lumdoarf complaining about grouping and nobody listening to him.  Well atleast I know how Lumdoarf is feeling and would know the reason if he up and took off.  I know, I know Lumy is almost as high as me now, and congrats to him.  Just trying to make a point.  Even though we may poke fun at him or give our opinions of his complaints at least we know what is going on.  I'm not saying I wish he left or anything just trying to make a point, we all need to post under general our issues and concerns.  Maybe there are others that feel like you do, or maybe not, but this is how we will resolve issues or find a solution anyway.  Anyway just my two cents worth on the PRIVATE section.<br><br>&lt;Back to Gand issue&gt;<br>Is this due to a misunderstanding and someone speaking for the guild and not it's members?  I think we need to be very careful what we say to each other especially if we carry the title of officer since when spoken to by an officer one may think that it's the opinion of all officers.<br><br>Hate to see you go Gand.<br><br>Does any other guild member feel in the dark on this?  Is this what goes on in that private officer chat?  Some of these issues need to be talked about..  There is talk that goes on in the back ground, some guessing, some rumors of what is going on.<br><br>I'm still very happy with our guild, happy with the leadership, the things we do (try to be a part of it when I can), heh after <br>KC last night it's hard to keep my eyes open this am.   &lt;yawn&gt;<br>Was grouped with some Chosen Ones and Conclave of steel last night.  Personally I wish I had a bit more time to be able to join in a little bit more often, but what with renovations, baby due mid May, and RL kinda hard to be a power gamer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Anyway Gand hope you haven't deleted the account yet, but if you have it was nice knowing you to bad we couldn't work out these differences.

There's been almost as much talking between 7 or 8 Officers than the whole guild. What could they be talking about? What could they possibly talk about that we shouldn't hear? Maybe it's corruption? Or maybe it's the 7 or 8 Officers that make the guild? Or maybe our opinion doesn't matter? Back to the Gandorph thing, who decides that he's not allowed in the guild? Is it the 7 or 8 Officers that has access to the Officer's forum? Or is it the guild's decision?

In my opinion, the best way to do this is to branch out the officers forum, one in private and one in officers only. If you wanna talk about initiate comments and inputs, raid planning, etc. this are stuff that probably tanko is talking about. But if you talk about making decisions about whether to grant initiates full membership, or about expelling somebody from the guild, then that is officers only subject. So my 2cp is to branch it out, officer forum on private, and officer forum just exclusive for officers.<br><br>-redman- <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub64.ezboard.com/uvhmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vhmoore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#993300>(4/12/02 1:24:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub64.ezboard.com/ftavernheroesfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Gandorphs Final Words</span><hr size=1> This is in responce to Poete,<br><br>you can say what you want if you had been in my shoes you would have asked the same questions i did, and wonder why you would say bad things about Gand behind his back.<br><br>as for talking to Rmog, i was not told anything about what could happen to my situation, for getting back into the TH.<br>so i gave Rmog a tell, and asked if i wasnt let back if i could join TCO, not what Poete wants you to believe.<br><br>Yes, i got hot at poete and emmers, but understand all i did was go to the legends server to see if and what was new to EQ, i cant do this with a lvl 1 char so i transfered him to that server with all intentions of coming back.<br><br>you guy were my friends and i missed you, so i came back, i wasnt looking for Greener Pastures, so please dont say that is what i was doing.<br><br>and as for waiting on a answer, i was a upstanding member of BRH, and should have been reinstated when i got back, no matter what, and not be riducualed for trying something new.<br><br>i hope i did not offend anyone cause with the exception of a few i fell that you are all still my friends, and give me a tell, you know what chars i am playing.<br><br>again this is just my side of the story, believe what you want, i cant force my char onto you guys.<br><br>Have Fun, and may your journeys be blessed<br><br>ps if you remember when i did transfer we were in transit of webpages and i am still new to this kind of forum<br><br>Anyone that has never made a mistake, never tried anything new(sound familliar?) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub64.ezboard.com/uvhmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vhmoore</A> at: 4/12/02 1:29:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub64.ezboard.com/umauicorpses.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maui Corpses</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#993300>(4/12/02 2:54:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub64.ezboard.com/ftavernheroesfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Gandorphs Final Words</span><hr size=1> just a word from a troll...

But I've been around longer than you think.  I joined BarRoom Heroes almost a full year-and-a-half ago, though for a good portion of that time I was unable to play EQ.  <br><br>I'm a member of this guild, though sadly I haven't had much of a chance to participate in many of the guild activities.  I'm still too low level to be a help in guildraids, and I don't level very fast either, so it will probably be a couple more months before that changes.  <br><br>It hasn't bothered me though, because I felt that when I did finally get those needed levels, I'd have a great bunch of people to play with, and I'd rather look at that long-term goal than consider leaving the guild for another one that could help me more and group with me at my current level.  I still feel that way, I like you guys  =)<br><br>But Maui's words bothered me quite a bit, at least enough for me to create this monstrosity of a post.  My only option, my only vote on an issue is to /guildremove?  Or to threaten it?  I don't want that, I don't think most people want that.  I'd like to know that when I raise a concern it is going to be considered at the very least, on the simple merit of my being a member of the guild.  That's the only type of attitude that will make our guild a true family, and not just another 'uber' raid-machine.  I just kinda wanted to say that I hope things aren't really that way, or that they aren't headed that way.<br><br>As far as the OP goes though, I'm completely ignorant of the situation, so I wont even try to enter into it.  I will say though, that Poete has seemed very fair from the chat I've seen, and though his opinions may vary from others, I don't think his devotion to TH, or even BH before it, can be questioned.  I hope it's just one of those simple misunderstandings that happen even in trivial things like real-life, and also in more serious matters such as Everquest.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub64.ezboard.com/uemmersbearhumper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>emmers bearhumper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Meat Shield</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#993300>(4/14/02 5:26:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub64.ezboard.com/ftavernheroesfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gandorphs Final Words</span><hr size=1> First off all leading a guild is HARD and alot of woork, so the guild leader needs officers to help him, but as we all know to many leaders is just gonna be a mess.<br>I agree tho most of the stuff on the officer board dosent have to be private but some stuff does, and therefor we need to have a place to post it and we need a place to post where no one else are allowed to post.<br>About Gand, i am very sorry it had to end that way, but first off all no one knew he left to an other server, even if he says he posted it here.
