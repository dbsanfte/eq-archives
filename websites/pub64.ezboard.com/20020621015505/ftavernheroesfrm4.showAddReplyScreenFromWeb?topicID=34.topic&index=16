Words</span><hr size=1> Maui,<br>
<br>
Most of you don't know me, other than the occasional 'Hi' on guild-chat, or through the questions I ask of you.  But I've been around longer than you think.  I joined BarRoom Heroes almost a full year-and-a-half ago, though for a good portion of that time I was unable to play EQ.  <br>
<br>
I'm a member of this guild, though sadly I haven't had much of a chance to participate in many of the guild activities.  I'm still too low level to be a help in guildraids, and I don't level very fast either, so it will probably be a couple more months before that changes.  <br>
<br>
It hasn't bothered me though, because I felt that when I did finally get those needed levels, I'd have a great bunch of people to play with, and I'd rather look at that long-term goal than consider leaving the guild for another one that could help me more and group with me at my current level.  I still feel that way, I like you guys  =)<br>
<br>
But Maui's words bothered me quite a bit, at least enough for me to create this monstrosity of a post.  My only option, my only vote on an issue is to /guildremove?  Or to threaten it?  I don't want that, I don't think most people want that.  I'd like to know that when I raise a concern it is going to be considered at the very least, on the simple merit of my being a member of the guild.  That's the only type of attitude that will make our guild a true family, and not just another 'uber' raid-machine.  I just kinda wanted to say that I hope things aren't really that way, or that they aren't headed that way.<br>
<br>
As far as the OP goes though, I'm completely ignorant of the situation, so I wont even try to enter into it.  I will say though, that Poete has seemed very fair from the chat I've seen, and though his opinions may vary from others, I don't think his devotion to TH, or even BH before it, can be questioned.  I hope it's just one of those simple misunderstandings that happen even in trivial things like real-life, and also in more serious matters such as Everquest.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub64.ezboard.com/uemmersbearhumper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>emmers bearhumper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Meat Shield</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#993300>(4/14/02 5:26:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub64.ezboard.com/ftavernheroesfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gandorphs Final Words</span><hr size=1> First off all leading a guild is HARD and alot of woork, so the guild leader needs officers to help him, but as we all know to many leaders is just gonna be a mess.<br>
I agree tho most of the stuff on the officer board dosent have to be private but some stuff does, and therefor we need to have a place to post it and we need a place to post where no one else are allowed to post.<br>
About Gand, i am very sorry it had to end that way, but first off all no one knew he left to an other server, even if he says he posted it here. I am not saying he is lying, but i am saying it is easy for people to think he left without saying anything.<br>
I consider him a friend and i hope he still does with me.<br>
He got a bit hot at me, i am not sure if i was unfair i just tried to explain to him why we couldnt just invite him and that we had to follow our rules.<br>

TH is infact improving(from my point of veiw) and I like the way the guild is going. TH has gone more high lvl, not like old BRH. Of course I have some things I don't like to much, but that isn't for this post, everyone have something they don't like about everything, no exception, so one thing can never get perfect for all, just for one person.<br>
<br>

<br>
1. The situation with Gandorf I feel was handled correctly. Whether Gandorf had said he was leaving or not, deleting his character or not he still disappeared without giving us updates. He left us in the dark. Gandorf should be understanding about that and should have worked with the guild more instead of getting hot and demanding. When you move a character to another server I would pretty much say this is removing your character from the guild. No matter how you look at it......... The guild tag isn't there.<br>
<br>
2. The plain fact that there is an officers area on this board should make you all happy. The things that go on there are for the officers, or else it would be public to members correct? I consider it being nosy by wanting to see whats posted there. In fact there doesnt need to be an officers area AT ALL. but it helps them. How bout this. lets ask the officers to record all their e-mails and tells and post those up for the members too! Doesn't this sound wrong to you all?<br>
<br>
Lets not pry ok? We are getting a little too paranoid of conspiracies when we should be having fun in the game. And EQ is a hard game to have fun in without structure on the higher level. Without this structure we would not be tackling the raids we have been, and i don't think anybody disagrees with me when i say that our raids are a lot of fun. because they are. So i would like to say that i appreciate all of the officers work and the guild leaders work put into the guild. The work shows. And the same goes for everyone else in the guild. Everyone working together makes us a family.... a strong family with structure.<br>

He should have gave TH some time to think about it.<br>
<br>
here's my opinion about some stuff:<br>
I believe BRH was a fun family guild, we got a few low level people that joined and wanted free stuff or wanted to get power leveled. I suggested to Balvanie about a level cap of 30 or so, he said no. TH was born with a level cap of 40 (I feel that's too high, we are not uber, but that's my opinion). Everyone in BRH knew just about everyone. Everyone in TH knows just about every (unless your new to the guild), atleast I know just about everyone. TH has the same family structure as BRH, but I don't think BRH was a good raiding guild. I also believe that BRH was headed into that direction, and that everyone was leveling pretty fast. So I feel that TH is still BRH with a little more rules. <br>
<br>
As far as that guy that said that the member's only option is to /guildremove, he's just way wrong, I don't care what level he is. At work, if I don't like something, I'll bring it up in a meeting, I'm not gonna just quit. And if TH ever enforced strict uber rules, and i post my opinion, and nothing's ever donw about it, than i'll /guildremove. That'll be the only time.<br>
<br>
sorry if this didn't come out right, im in a hurry.<br>
<br>
oh and when did the subject title change to TH is falling apart? This whole subject about Gandorph was blown way out of proportion. I'f that my fault im sorry. TH's is fine, and will always be fine cuz we are not a guild with uber rules. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Also, this whole post should end here. And keep in mind, all this is just my opinion, we all think different. <p><img src="http://www.twixmixy.com/images/everquest/THDakidBreakstuff.gif"> <BR>

 This is not your fault Dakid.<br>
 Gandorph may be the first person we do accept in the guild.<br>
 So we need to speak about it and we need to be very clear so all understabd.<br>
<br>
 What I see in the last 2 post and in the last tells I got about this subject is that: most of the members are agree with the decision of the officers.<br>

It really isn't anything all that great and some of the desision we haft to make are scary or down right hard, but rest asured Poete, Emmers, Dumak, Bracchus, Tk, Shu(absent at the moment due to extream work changes), Goolak and I are always working for and making desisions that put the guild first before ourselves.  But before you get mad, look at the names of the officers, don't look at the title, look at the people all these people are great guys and drop everything at a moments notice to come help even for little problems.  I may not be the most liked officer simply because I am a little hard edged on raids and I appologise for hurt feelings but basicaly I hate having people die on raids other than me and If I see people doing stuff that will get themselves kill or others then I yell otherwise its just battle comands that are to be followed so we can win.<br>
<br>
Once again this is being blown out of proportion, if you have trouble with anyone that is an officer being an officer speak up and if there is someone the guild as a whole sees as someone they want helping make desisions because they do not trust us officers name that person and with a proper vote they will become an officers but they will get all the responsibilty we have, and frankly that starts to change the game.<br>

what the heck did i start?  since when are you guys falling apart?  well, anyway, some friends of mine convinced me not to delete such a high lvl char, and i did what was asked, i waited a week for an answer as to whether or not you guys wanted me back.<br>
<br>
well it has been a week, no answer from anyone so i am now a member of &lt;Nirok&gt;, so that i stirred up a bees nest, that was not my intention<br>
<br>
but for the record, i did do as i was asked, if i stepped on some toes my covering my butt, im sorry<br>
<br>
i got thrown on the defencive when i got back, and yes i got hot when i was told i had to wait, i just thought it was unfair at the time.<br>
<br>
well im still out there, give me a tell<br>
