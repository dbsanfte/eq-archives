What is a man, <BR>If his chief good and market of his time <BR>Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more. <BR>Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, <BR>Looking before and after, gave us not <BR>That capability and god-like reason <BR>To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be <BR>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple <BR>Of thinking too precisely on the event, <BR>A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom <BR>And ever three parts coward, I do not know <BR>Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;' <BR>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means <BR>To do't. <BR>Examples gross as earth exhort me: <BR>Witness this army of such mass and charge <BR>Led by a delicate and tender prince, <BR>Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd <BR>Makes mouths at the invisible event, <BR>Exposing what is mortal and unsure <BR>To all that fortune, death and danger dare, <BR>Even for an egg-shell. <BR>Rightly to be great <BR>Is not to stir without great argument, <BR>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw <BR>When honour's at the stake. <BR>How stand I then, <BR>That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, <BR>Excitements of my reason and my blood, <BR>And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see <BR>The imminent death of twenty thousand men, <BR>That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, <BR>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot <BR>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, <BR>Which is not tomb enough and continent <BR>To hide the slain? O, from this time forth, <BR>My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!&quot;<P>King Gelaqua is slain by the Marauding party<P><B>The band:</B> &quot;Something is rotten in the state of Riftseekers.&quot;<P>Exeunt all after looting<P></I></center><P><center><IMG SRC="http://users.pandora.be/TheAlliance/Mortalis/20-10-2004/King%20Corpse.JPG"></center><P>He also had some presents for us<P><center><IMG SRC="http://users.pandora.be/TheAlliance/Mortalis/20-11-2004/Crystal%20Hilted%20Shinai.JPG"></center><P>And<P><center><IMG SRC="http://users.pandora.be/TheAlliance/Mortalis/20-11-2004/Allins%20Mace.JPG"></center><P><HR /><P><I><BR><B>Some funnies ;-)</B></I><P>You see even Old people like Arfabel know some things<P><center><IMG SRC="http://users.pandora.be/TheAlliance/Mortalis/20-11-2004/Arfa.JPG"></center><P>And who is always saying monks slack, it's there mouse.<P><center><IMG SRC="http://users.pandora.be/TheAlliance/Mortalis/20-11-2004/Whop.JPG"></center></font></p>
