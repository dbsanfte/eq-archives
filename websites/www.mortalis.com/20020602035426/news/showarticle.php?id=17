After our last update, as you can imagine, the server was more or less cleared. However Shei was still alive, so we had to fix that.<P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/shei2.jpg"><P>we finished our evening with our first blood of ssraeshza kill, to gathered informations about the shissar emperor.<P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/blood.jpg"><P>At that point, the server was really cleared. We had 3 days of slacking in a row, since we were denied a shot at emperor.. people kill blood for loot, they don't give a fuck if it's a trigger for the emperor, talk about fun. <BR>To have a good shot at emperor you need at least 55 people key'd in zone, we could do that for sure but some other guilds go gank blood for loot which requires way less attendance, this is fucking bullshit!<BR>VI if you read these lines... remove the loot from blood PLEASE!!<BR>Each time blood will spawn it will end up with /petition spamming and GMs all over the place, is that what you want ? us neither.<P>We were nicely asked to leave that day, with our 60 members ready to gank emperor.<BR>Anyway we were pissed, pissed so much that we decided to raid rivervale, because the GM present that day was a halfling =p<P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/rivervale.jpg"><P>GM said he was sorry about the blood incident, but not to the point of letting his homelands in the hands of Mortalis !<P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/bristlebane.jpg"><P>AE FDs, death touchs, AE fear, hell he was even immuned to melee and magic damage, it was a pure carnage, we vaporised like an old fart!<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>/rant on<P>Statue spawned friday, so we went in Kael to pay a visit to the avatar of war.<BR>We had a total of 7 clerics. impossible you say ? I must say that these guys did the most amazing job ever. We had a total of 2 deaths, one beeing MT (due to a CH fizzled!). If you didn't know Mortalis exists since october 2001, our tanks have roughly 500-600 hps less than other known uberguilds, and we totally owned the dude with one warrior death, with a low amount of people.<P>/rant off<P>this is the last screenie I post of an AoW corpse.<P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/aow5.jpg"><P>some other gimp stuff died such as Arch Lich, Creator, burrower, THO, etc etc..<P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P><B>Special section : Why is Mortalis so uber?</B><P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/banjo.jpg"><P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/erect.jpg"><P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/gross.jpg"><P><IMG SRC="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/billyboy.kheops/news/testicule.jpg"><P>Stay tuned.
