      general motto is to be fair to everyone around us; to try and help each 
      other out as much as possible and to be able to do the things that not 
      every one is able to do. This guild is about accomplishments, teamwork, 
      pride in each other, and efficiency. Our focus is to be the betterment of 
      the guild, never the individual. In order to do this we all need to follow 
      some sort of guideline to keep things running smooth. The following define 
      the basic rules of the guild, how to handle problems and our loot rules.</font></i></font><br>

    <b><font size="2">Expectations</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    I will be honest with everyone right now - If you need special attention, if 
    you need a group the second you log in to the game, if you expect everyone 
    to hear every thing you say - then you are in the <b>WRONG</b> guild! This 
    is a big guild, not every one is going to know each other right away. <b>YOU</b> 
    as members need to make yourselves noticed and make the effort to help each 
    other out. Showing up to our raids is the best way to interact with each 
    other and meet friends. YOU need to make the effort to <b>READ</b> the 
    message boards to keep yourself informed of guild events and raids. <br>
    Respect to Others<br>
    The guild motto is to be as fair as reasonably possible with every one 
    around you, whether it be guild or non-guild people. <br>
    Please respect that people play this game during their free time. If people 
    are busy, <b>DON'T</b> expect them to drop what ever they are doing to come 
    resurrect you or teleport you! <br>
    Remember that people playing during their free time is just that, their time 
    to do what they want to do! <b>NO ONE</b> is forced to do any thing they 
    don't want to do. <br>
    If some one tells you <i>&quot;No, I am busy&quot;</i> then you need to find another 
    option and leave them alone.<b> DO NOT</b> harass people please!<br>
    Even though you will never be forced to do things, it is highly encouraged 
    that you help out your friends and guildmates whenever possible. <br>

    <b>Guild Chat</b><br>
    Guildsay is <b>NOT</b> your personal auction block. Keep the auctions or 
    trades of items or the pricing of items OUT of guildsay. If you need help 
    with this type of thing, please ask some one you feel comfortable with and 
    use <i>/tells.</i> <br>
    If there is ever an argument, it is to be taken to <i>/tells</i> 
    immediately! Dragging an argument into guildsay is unacceptable! <br>
    Use of racial, derogatory remarks or verbal abuse of a person with the 
    intent to hurt is completely unacceptable and can result in immediate guild 
    removal. <br>
    While it is important to keep a sense of humour, sometimes people do get 
    carried away. Please be considerate towards those who may be sensitive to 
    what you say and to those who just like to have quiet guild chat. <br>
    Please keep foul language to a minimum. <br>
    Don't spam guildsay with requests for a resurrection or a teleport. If you 
    need this type of service then look for some one near your area and ask them 
    using <i>/tells</i>. <br>
    Whining in guild chat is annoying, don't do it. <br>

    <b>Complaints</b><br>
    If an issue comes up where you have a loot, camp or grouping problem that 
    you can not deal with on your own, then please contact your class leader, an 
    officer or myself for assistance. However, we are <b>NOT</b> babysitters! 
    Try to resolve things on your own if possible! <b>NEVER</b> argue with 
    people using <i>/shout</i> or <i>/ooc</i>. Take it to <i>/tells</i> please! 
    Don't be afraid to talk to some one if you have a problem, please talk to 
    us, that is what we are here for.<br>

    <p>
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#cccccc">
    <b>Day to Day Grouping</b><br>
    It is <b>YOUR</b> responsibility to find or make groups. Many times 
    guild-only groups are not possible. Some times there simply is not room for 
    more people in certain areas. Don't take these types of things personally. 
    There are tons of options for people to get experience, sometimes it's just 
    not the place you might wish. <br>
    You need to take the initiative and form a group if you can't find a group 
    yourself. Any 4 people in this guild can kill almost any blue mob in the 
    game. You have to take what you can get and grab whoever may be asking for 
    groups at the zone you are in. If you are going to limit yourself to 
    guild-only groups with enchanters and clerics every time, then you are just 
    going to frustrate yourself. <br>

    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#cccccc">
    <b>Help with Quests and FA Items</b><br>
    <b>YOU</b> need to know what to do and how to handle your quest! It is <b>
    YOUR</b> responsibility to gather the information you need so that every one 
    helping you fully understands what is going on. Know as much as you can 
    before every one is gathered so that there is as little delay as possible.<br>
    Plan ahead - Have a time and date as to when you need help and where to 
    meet. Arrange your own transportation for those who are coming to help as 
    well. <br>
    Post a message on the board so that people see that you need help on a 
    certain day. <br>
    Contact the people you need help from in game and plan ahead with those 
    people. Obviously certain classes are needed for certain things. <br>
    Be <b>PATIENT</b> and reasonable as to when and what you need. You can't 
    expect people to drop what they are doing and come help you at a moment's 
    notice. You also can't expect to post a message on the message board and 
    expect everyone to read it and be there. <b>YOU</b> need to plan ahead, <b>
    YOU</b> need to ask the people that you need there, <b>YOU</b> need to 
    organize it. <br>

    <b>Raids</b><br>
    Guild sponsored raids are those designated before hand by officers. It will 
    generally include ST, NToV dragons, SoV mobs, VP, SoL bosses etc.<br>
    <b>EVERY ONE IS EXPECTED TO BE AT A PRE-PLANNED RAID IF YOU ARE ONLINE!</b> 
    It is one thing if you have Real Life things to do, or if you can't be on 
    for an extended period of time. It is the people that are camping experience 
    and 'dodging' raids that are the problem. The reason you are in this guild 
    is to raid the hard stuff and that means that <b>EVERY ONE</b> is needed. I 
    have been told that <i>&quot;I need experience&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;There is no loot there 
    for me&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;That is such a boring raid, I'd rather go to sleep&quot;</i>. 
    This kind of attitude will not be tolerated, if you can't be a team player 
    then it is time for you to find another team. <br>
    <b>IF YOU ARE LATE, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET TO WHERE WE 
    ARE!</b> Logging in 30 minutes after we started is no excuse for you to not 
    try to get to where we are! The least you can do is try to help out. Also 
    try to park your character in an area that is convenient for transports or 
    even better, place your character at the meeting point itself so you are 
    ready to go. Please be prepared prior to an event with any supplies needed 
    as well, such as tiny coffins, peridots, food and water, pearls, stones for 
    Hate or Sky etc. <i>(pearls &amp; peridots are supplied via guildfund)</i><br>
    <b>NON-GUILD WILL BE TREATED FAIRLY ON RAIDS!</b> Of course we will not go 
    out of our way to invite non-guild people, but if they happen to be in an 
    area we are raiding, we <b>WILL</b> respect them and treat them fairly. 
    People that feel we should shut others out just because they don't have our 
    guild tag can <i>/guildremove</i> right now.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#cccccc">
    <b>MANDATORY</b> - Means that if you are online you are expected to be at 
    the event that the guild is at. It does not mean that you call in sick to 
    work or give up RL things to be at the raid! <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p>
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#cccccc">
    <b>NON-MANDATORY</b> - Means that you are NOT forced to be at the event, but 
    it would be nice to have every one there helping.</font></td>
