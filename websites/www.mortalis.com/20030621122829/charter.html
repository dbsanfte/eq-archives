<blockquote> Our general motto is to be fair to everyone around us; to try and 
  help each other out as much as possible and to be able to do the things that 
  not every one is able to do. This guild is about accomplishments, teamwork, 
  pride in each other, and efficiency. Our focus is to be the betterment of the 
  guild, never the individual. In order to do this we all need to follow some 
  sort of guideline to keep things running smooth. The following define the basic 
  rules of the guild, how to handle problems and our loot rules.</blockquote>

<blockquote> <span class="header"><strong>Expectations</strong></span><br>
  <br>
  Mortalis is a guild of hard work and honour. We base our efforts on team-work, 
  energy and a sound and historic knowledge of Everquest; we strive to be the 
  best we can be. However we also believe that we should at all times be as fair 
  as reasonably possible with those around us in Everquest, guild or non-guild. 
  We respect that people play this game during their free time. It is a game, 
  but a game in which many people invest a huge amount of time and skill. Playing 
  within a high level guild requires the basic understanding that people are busy. 
  Players have a long history and play for experience in their own way to compensate 
  for the rogiurs of combat in new zones. They also conduct themselves professionally: 
  if you require the services of a certain class i.e. for res, CR or for transport 
  you request it politely. People will get to you when they are able.<br>
  Remember that people playing during their free time is just that, their time 
  to do what they want to do! NO ONE is forced to do any thing they don't want 
  to do. <br>
  If some one tells you <i>&quot;No, I am busy&quot;</i> then you need to find 
  another option and leave them alone. DO NOT harass people please!<br>
  Even though you will never be forced to do things, it is highly encouraged that 
  you help out your friends and guildmates whenever possible.<span class="txt"> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;</span> I will be honest with everyone right now - If you need special 
  attention, if you need a group the second you log in to the game, if you expect 
  everyone to hear every thing you say - then you are in the WRONG guild! This 
  is a big guild, not every one is going to know each other right away. YOU as 
  members need to make yourselves noticed and make the effort to help each other 
  out. Showing up to our raids is the best way to interact with each other and 
  meet friends. YOU need to make the effort to READ the message boards to keep 
  yourself informed of guild events and raids. <br>
  Respect to Others <span class="header">Guild Chat<br>
  </span><span class="txt"><br>
  Guildsay is NOT your personal auction block. Keep the auctions or trades of 
  items or the pricing of items OUT of guildsay. If you need help with this type 
  of thing, please ask some one you feel comfortable with and use <i>/tells.</i> 
  <br>
  If there is ever an argument, it is to be taken to <i>/tells</i> immediately! 
  Dragging an argument into guildsay is unacceptable! <br>
  Use of racial, derogatory remarks or verbal abuse of a person with the intent 
  to hurt is completely unacceptable and can result in immediate guild removal. 
  <br>
  While it is important to keep a sense of humour, sometimes people do get carried 
  away. Please be considerate towards those who may be sensitive to what you say 
  and to those who just like to have quiet guild chat. <br>
  Please keep foul language to a minimum. <br>
  Don't spam guildsay with requests for a resurrection or a teleport. If you need 
  this type of service then look for some one near your area and ask them using 
  <i>/tells</i>. <br>
  Whining in guild chat is annoying, don't do it. <br>
  &nbsp;</span> <span class="header">Complaints</span><span class="txt"><br>
  <br>
  If an issue comes up where you have a loot, camp or grouping problem that you 
  can not deal with on your own, then please contact your class leader, an officer 
  or myself for assistance. However, we are NOT babysitters! Try to resolve things 
  on your own if possible! NEVER argue with people using <i>/shout</i> or <i>/ooc</i>. 
  Take it to <i>/tells</i> please! Don't be afraid to talk to some one if you 
  have a problem, please talk to us, that is what we are here for.<br>
  &nbsp;</span> <span class="header">Day to Day Grouping</span><span class="txt"><br>
  <br>
  It is YOUR responsibility to find or make groups. Many times guild-only groups 
  are not possible. Some times there simply is not room for more people in certain 
  areas. Don't take these types of things personally. There are tons of options 
  for people to get experience, sometimes it's just not the place you might wish. 
  <br>
  You need to take the initiative and form a group if you can't find a group yourself. 
  Any 4 people in this guild can kill almost any blue mob in the game. You have 
  to take what you can get and grab whoever may be asking for groups at the zone 
  you are in. If you are going to limit yourself to guild-only groups with enchanters 
  and clerics every time, then you are just going to frustrate yourself. <br>
  &nbsp;</span> <span class="header">Help with Quests and FA Items</span><span class="txt"><br>
  <br>
  YOU need to know what to do and how to handle your quest! It is YOUR responsibility 
  to gather the information you need so that every one helping you fully understands 
  what is going on. Know as much as you can before every one is gathered so that 
  there is as little delay as possible.<br>
  Plan ahead - Have a time and date as to when you need help and where to meet. 
  Arrange your own transportation for those who are coming to help as well. <br>
  Post a message on the board so that people see that you need help on a certain 
  day. <br>
  Contact the people you need help from in game and plan ahead with those people. 
  Obviously certain classes are needed for certain things. <br>
  Be PATIENT and reasonable as to when and what you need. You can't expect people 
  to drop what they are doing and come help you at a moment's notice. You also 
  can't expect to post a message on the message board and expect everyone to read 
  it and be there. YOU need to plan ahead, YOU need to ask the people that you 
  need there, YOU need to organize it. <br>
  &nbsp;</span> <span class="header">Raids</span><span class="txt"><br>
  <br>
  Guild sponsored raids are those designated before hand by officers. It will 
  generally include ST, NToV dragons, SoV mobs, VP, SoL bosses etc.<br>
  EVERY ONE IS EXPECTED TO BE AT A PRE-PLANNED RAID IF YOU ARE ONLINE! It is one 
  thing if you have Real Life things to do, or if you can't be on for an extended 
  period of time. It is the people that are camping experience and 'dodging' raids 
  that are the problem. The reason you are in this guild is to raid the hard stuff 
  and that means that EVERY ONE is needed. I have been told that <i>&quot;I need 
  experience&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;There is no loot there for me&quot;</i> or 
  <i>&quot;That is such a boring raid, I'd rather go to sleep&quot;</i>. This 
  kind of attitude will not be tolerated, if you can't be a team player then it 
  is time for you to find another team. <br>
  IF YOU ARE LATE, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE! 
  Logging in 30 minutes after we started is no excuse for you to not try to get 
  to where we are! The least you can do is try to help out. Also try to park your 
  character in an area that is convenient for transports or even better, place 
  your character at the meeting point itself so you are ready to go. Please be 
  prepared prior to an event with any supplies needed as well, such as tiny coffins, 
  peridots, food and water, pearls, stones for Hate or Sky etc. <i>(pearls &amp; 
  peridots are supplied via guildfund)</i><br>
  NON-GUILD WILL BE TREATED FAIRLY ON RAIDS! Of course we will not go out of our 
  way to invite non-guild people, but if they happen to be in an area we are raiding, 
  we WILL respect them and treat them fairly. People that feel we should shut 
  others out just because they don't have our guild tag can <i>/guildremove</i> 
  right now.<br>
  &nbsp;</span> <span class="txt"> <b>MANDATORY</b> - Means that if you are online 
  you are expected to be at the event that the guild is at. It does not mean that 
  you call in sick to work or give up RL things to be at the raid! <br>
  &nbsp;</span> <span class="txt"> <b>NON-MANDATORY</b> - Means that you are NOT 
  forced to be at the event, but it would be nice to have every one there helping.</span>
