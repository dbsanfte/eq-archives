Tears rolled and laughter was heard all around as they were reminising of the old days when big guilds enrolled to venture the Planes of Power, Ssra or Vex Thal. <P>As the expansions came out, big guilds like Curse or Eternity (later known as Amenta), Tide and Mortalis were molded and progressed throughout various encounters. Other guilds like Ancient Dominion, Dawnraiders, Nordlys and many others, followed at their own pace and enjoyed the game on a family basis.<BR>Sadly enough the population decreased and guilds began having trouble to maintain full raid forces to overwhelm the harder encounters throughout the Omens of War expansion. Amenta and Tide merged during that time and kept a<BR>maximum of players available to conquer ( read &quot;zerg&quot; ;-) j/k) the newly discovered worlds. Mortalis had to cope with sudden decrease of members and struggled on with low numbers, using cunning and skill to beat every single opponent out there. <P>Sadly... other games and real life took its toll on Mortalis and they were forced to retire from the hardcore raiding scene. Keeping the spirit and the good name of Mortalis where it belongs. To be remembered as the guild where that got respect from its achievements from the past and the present. We all remembers those that were proud members and will still be Mortalis. From day one till its last days on Venril Sathir. <P>I wish you all the best of luck on Antonius Bayle and may the Mortalis spirit be amongst you when playing in another guild.<P>Good luck on AB to all</B><center><I></font></p>
