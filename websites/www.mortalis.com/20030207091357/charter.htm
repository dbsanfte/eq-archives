                            to try and help each other out as much as possible 
                            and to be able to do the things that not every one 
                            is able to do. This guild is about accomplishments, 
                            teamwork, pride in each other, and efficiency. Our 
                            focus is to be the betterment of the guild, never 
                            the individual. In order to do this we all need to 
                            follow some sort of guideline to keep things running 
                            smooth. The following define the basic rules of the 
                            guild, how to handle problems and our loot rules.</font></p>

                            Mortalis is a guild of hard work and honour. We base 
                            our efforts on team-work, energy and a sound and historic 
                            knowledge of Everquest; we strive to be the best we 
                            can be. However we also believe that we should at 
                            all times be as fair as reasonably possible with those 
                            around us in Everquest, guild or non-guild. We respect 
                            that people play this game during their free time. 
                            It is a game, but a game in which many people invest 
                            a huge amount of time and skill. </font></font></p>
                          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#cccccc" size="3"><font size="2">Playing 
                            within a high level guild requires the basic understanding 
                            that people are busy. Players have a long history 
                            and play for experience in their own way to compensate 
                            for the rogiurs of combat in new zones. They also 
                            conduct themselves professionally: if you require 
                            the services of a certain class i.e. for res, CR or 
                            for transport you request it politely. People will 
                            get to you when they are able.<br>
                            Remember that people playing during their free time 
                            is just that, their time to do what they want to do! 
                            NO ONE is forced to do any thing they don't want to 
                            do. <br>
                            If some one tells you <i>&quot;No, I am busy&quot;</i> 
                            then you need to find another option and leave them 
                            alone. DO NOT harass people please!<br>
                            Even though you will never be forced to do things, 
                            it is highly encouraged that you help out your friends 
                            and guildmates whenever possible.</font><span class="txt"><font size="2">

                            to know each other right away. YOU as members need 
                            to make yourselves noticed and make the effort to 
                            help each other out. Showing up to our raids is the 
                            best way to interact with each other and meet friends. 
                            YOU need to make the effort to READ the message boards 
                            to keep yourself informed of guild events and raids.

                            people do get carried away. Please be considerate 
                            towards those who may be sensitive to what you say 
                            and to those who just like to have quiet guild chat. 
                            <br>
                            Please keep foul language to a minimum. <br>
                            Don't spam guildsay with requests for a resurrection 
                            or a teleport. If you need this type of service then 
                            look for some one near your area and ask them using 
                            <i>/tells</i>. <br>
                            Whining in guild chat is annoying, don't do it. <br>

                            It is YOUR responsibility to find or make groups. 
                            Many times guild-only groups are not possible. Some 
                            times there simply is not room for more people in 
                            certain areas. Don't take these types of things personally. 
                            There are tons of options for people to get experience, 
                            sometimes it's just not the place you might wish. 
                            <br>
                            You need to take the initiative and form a group if 
                            you can't find a group yourself. Any 4 people in this 
                            guild can kill almost any blue mob in the game. You 
                            have to take what you can get and grab whoever may 
                            be asking for groups at the zone you are in. If you 
                            are going to limit yourself to guild-only groups with 
                            enchanters and clerics every time, then you are just 
                            going to frustrate yourself. <br>

                            YOU need to know what to do and how to handle your 
                            quest! It is YOUR responsibility to gather the information 
                            you need so that every one helping you fully understands 
                            what is going on. Know as much as you can before every 
                            one is gathered so that there is as little delay as 
                            possible.<br>
                            Plan ahead - Have a time and date as to when you need 
                            help and where to meet. Arrange your own transportation 
                            for those who are coming to help as well. <br>
                            Post a message on the board so that people see that 
                            you need help on a certain day. <br>
                            Contact the people you need help from in game and 
                            plan ahead with those people. Obviously certain classes 
                            are needed for certain things. <br>
                            Be PATIENT and reasonable as to when and what you 
                            need. You can't expect people to drop what they are 
                            doing and come help you at a moment's notice. You 
                            also can't expect to post a message on the message 
                            board and expect everyone to read it and be there. 
                            YOU need to plan ahead, YOU need to ask the people 
                            that you need there, YOU need to organize it. <br>

                            <br>
                            Guild sponsored raids are those designated before 
                            hand by officers. It will generally include ST, NToV 
                            dragons, SoV mobs, VP, SoL bosses etc.<br>
                            EVERY ONE IS EXPECTED TO BE AT A PRE-PLANNED RAID 
                            IF YOU ARE ONLINE! It is one thing if you have Real 
                            Life things to do, or if you can't be on for an extended 
                            period of time. It is the people that are camping 
                            experience and 'dodging' raids that are the problem. 
                            The reason you are in this guild is to raid the hard 
                            stuff and that means that EVERY ONE is needed. I have 
                            been told that <i>&quot;I need experience&quot;</i> 
                            or <i>&quot;There is no loot there for me&quot;</i> 
                            or <i>&quot;That is such a boring raid, I'd rather 
                            go to sleep&quot;</i>. This kind of attitude will 
                            not be tolerated, if you can't be a team player then 
                            it is time for you to find another team. <br>
                            IF YOU ARE LATE, YOU ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE AN EFFORT 
                            TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE! Logging in 30 minutes after 
                            we started is no excuse for you to not try to get 
                            to where we are! The least you can do is try to help 
                            out. Also try to park your character in an area that 
                            is convenient for transports or even better, place 
                            your character at the meeting point itself so you 
                            are ready to go. Please be prepared prior to an event 
                            with any supplies needed as well, such as tiny coffins, 
                            peridots, food and water, pearls, stones for Hate 
                            or Sky etc. <i>(pearls &amp; peridots are supplied 
                            via guildfund)</i><br>
                            NON-GUILD WILL BE TREATED FAIRLY ON RAIDS! Of course 
                            we will not go out of our way to invite non-guild 
                            people, but if they happen to be in an area we are 
                            raiding, we WILL respect them and treat them fairly. 
                            People that feel we should shut others out just because 
                            they don't have our guild tag can <i>/guildremove</i> 
                            right now.<br>
