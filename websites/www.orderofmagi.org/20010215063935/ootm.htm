<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Sans" size="3">6 -17 -2K - Its update time...Expect the site to go underconstruction in the next week and the new version to be out!!!! Its a time of change. Also based on the poll on this web page, all new guild members unless under special circumstance must be at least level 20. The new rules for this will be up soon.

<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Sans" size="3">5 -10 -2K - I bring word of great news, the Order of the Magi has now split to Two servers. Now you can find us on the bristlebane server as well as the saryrn server. A special thanks goes out to all of the magi who made this possible as well as Darktap, the new Great Magi on the saryrn server. Congrats to you all. Also, look for the new saryrn server web page to come up shortly. Hey Darktap contact me on that so i know whats going on. 
This is a great day for the magi.

<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Sans" size="3">5 -1 -2K - Hail and well met....Rathjar is back and there is a lot of changes on the bristlebane server. So...until i get a email from you....No one will be on the roster page, you MUST email me to be put on the roster list. This must be done so that we can establish who left and who stayed with the server split.
 Thank you for you assistace in these hard times....also if I do not know who you are please make yourself know to me. It has come to my attention that we have a invisible element in our guild. This element is just in the guild for items and powerleveling. We DO NOT support beggers. Anyone begging to the guild, WILL be removed. If you wish to ask for help, that is one thing, but do not wine and beg if no one can help you.
 Also we DO NOT give away items. If a guildmate has a Item they no longer need or can not use, the DO NOT have to give it to you. If they do that is great, but DO NOT beg. You may get cheaper prices in the guild, but do not expect free stuff, just be happy if it happens. I have updated the rules to make our guild the way it was ment to be. Anyone having problems with these rules can email Rathjar@orderofmagi.org. Thank you 
for your faith for those of you that have stayed with the guild. We know that you care, and you will be rewarded. Please send me suggestions to make this guild the way it was ment to be, a tight group of fun players that love and enjoy this game.<br> -- Rathjar Maruuka<br>-- Great Magi<br>-- Order of the Magi
