<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the world was young and the peoples of
the world had first begun to have magick, a young high elf by the name of
Minviern studied the arts and was found to have a innate ability with them. As
time grew on and he mastered all the skills available to him...he yearned to
move on, to learn more, but no more was know, or allowed, by the peoples of that
time. Slowly and secretly the powers of the black art of necromancy creped into
his brain. He left his society and wondered the earth, learning this dark forbidden
art. But as all else, in time this too proved to be not enough for his absorbing
mind and again he sought more. It was in those years that he discovered a force
that controls magick. He called it the Magi. The Magi - a intangible force that
is the source of all power. It fuels the mana of men, as well as that of the
gods. Ages since the death of this powerful man a few remembered the secret
about the source of magi, the few except a society of people sworn to learn and
control this ancient force know as magi. Sworn to use this power to their own
ends.</p>

  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">While role-playing is not mandated as a must. It is
        greatly encouraged.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;Definition of role playing: Role-playing does not mean
        talking with &quot;Thee&quot; and &quot;Tho&quot;...It means adopting a
        persona for your character and using it when acting as your charter or
        talking with the /say (regular talk).&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">A person should only role-play with the /say command and
        all other commands are used when not role-playing. So using /tell you
        may be out of charter, but when using /say you are in character. Each
        character a player has should have his own personality.</li>

  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Multiple Characters in our guild by the same player are
        allowed, although some restrictions apply.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Your secondary characters must follow all the guild
        lines for regular admittance although you can sponsor yourself.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">A Player can only have one character in the guild that
        is a officer. Officers represent the guild and are not given away
        lightly. Officer status is given away based on that character and how he
        or she helps the guild. A secondary character is just that; not the
        first character and hence forth not the same person.</li>

        <p align="left"><b>The Order of the Magi</b> uses a democratic type
        system for all decisions including the voting of all officers.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">The voting system consist of this: 1 vote from the
        guild leader, 3 votes from elected officials, and 1 majority vote from
        all other guild members and one vote from all other officers.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">There are 3 votable positions available. These positions
        are givin officer status as well as having one vote in important issues.
        The 3 positions listed below.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>Captain of the Guard</b>. This is the position of the
        warrior hybrid classes. All warrior hybrid classes are members of the
        Royal Guard of the Magi and they will vote for one leader. Bards for the
        time being fall into this class.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>High Magi</b>. This is the leader of the Magi
        (caster) circle. Members of this circle are all pure casters such as
        wizards, magicians, enchanters, etc. They will elect one leader.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>High Priest.</b> This is the leader of the Priest
        circle. This circle includes all shamans and clerics.</li>

  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">All guild members must help other guild members when
        ever they can, so long as it doesn't cause them to travel out of there
        way (such as going from Halas to Freeport because someone needs a SOW. Also see twinking</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Guild members may charge a discounted rate for all
        skills they use for other guild members although it is recommended that
        they do the skill for free as long as the player asking for the skill to
        be done pays for all materials..</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">All teleport spells can be asked for by guild members so
        long as the caster has a convent means of getting himself back to the
        zone he is in. ( A one way trip from Halas to Greater Ferwith for the
        caster does not constitute a easy way back unless he can teleport
        himself back to a nearby zone.) If a caster can not port you for whatever reason, they may tell you no...so long as they are telling you no because they have 
	something more important to do such as they are in a good group or a plane raid that is acceptable. They do not have to port you.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">All spells should be cast on other guild members for
        free, although for some of the more mana draining spells a small fee paid
        as a courtesy.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Kill stealing from other guild members is NOT allowed in
        any way shape or form. The penalty for this is severe and can range from
        item and monetary fines to expulsion from the guild. It is permissible
        however to help a guild member who's death is almost guaranteed as well
        as helping kill a creature whose life is well below half for this will
        not give you xp or looting rights.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Twinking is not discouraged so long as it is on a subtle
        level. Giving away patchwork or bronze weapons is fine, although making
        the newbies do some simple quest for them is recommended, but giving
        away a full suit of etched ivy armor and a staff of the observer is
        greatly discouraged. We DO NOT allow beggars into out ranks. If you are caught begging you will be warned or removed. We DO NOT support the weak.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Power leveling is also not discouraged on subtle levels.
        Bringing a character up 4 or 5 levels in a day is fine, but bringing a
        charter from level 1 to level 15 is allowed but discouraged because it
        leaves their skills at a loss and makes them a weaker player because of
        it. Also see twinking above.</li>
