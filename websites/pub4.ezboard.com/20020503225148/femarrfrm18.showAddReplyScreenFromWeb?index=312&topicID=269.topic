At any rate, Brutas, I am saying that Christians are morally week in that they (not the non-believer) never fully accept responsibility for their actions.<br>
<br>
There is alot of complex answers to your points.  I'll try my best to share my point of view for this.(formating problems)<br>
<br>
Ok I'll start by adressing the difference between nature and conscience(or, humankind).  Space and Time exist, Thats a given.  Space is an environment where 'things' take place.  In our need for order we define those process' that take place within space as 'time'.  Space and Time, for the most part are more easily nderstood because they are relatively constant.  Its relatively constant because the 'things' that take place are a result of organisms that are 'bound' by nature.  These 'things' that take place, or events, react to their environment(space) according to their inherent survival mechanism.  Balance is obtained by species counteracting each other.  Basically, the organisms have no choice in the matter.  They react and act according to survival.  <br>
<br>
  Humans are not bound completly by nature because we have a choice.  That 'choice' throws a wrench into the space and time process.  We can choose to do something totally irrational.  Generally we don't.  But sometimes we do.  Entertainment is a great example of this.  Choose to play EQ or go to work.  I know there is a possibility that I can be fired which can jeopardize shelter and food for me.  But fuk=it, I wanna play.  <br>
<br>
  When we make a choice, space and time reacts upon our 'event'.  Space and time react to all events but the difference is that we have the ability to manipulate space and time on a conscious level, whether that level be rational or irrational.  <br>
<br>
  Ughh I hope this doesn't get ugly.  Space and time can also be compared to order and chaos.  In many ways, truth and love can be compared also.  The difference once again, is choice.  Space and time/order and chaos do not have a choice.  They always attempt balance.  Sometimes that balance takes 6 billion years and other times it takes a nanosecond.  But either way, the event takes place.  <br>
<br>
  Ok now back to the idea of 'the forbidden fruit'.  Ok lets pretend that God really is Alpha and omega.  I don't believe that God played the 'life' game and used all the cheat-codes.  Some people say, &quot;he is omnipotent&quot;.   God has feelings just like we do.  IMO, he did the 'life' thing as we are doing.  But God basically said( to Adam and Eve), &quot;Ok let us enjoy life together, and all the feelings, thoughts, events and everything else that comes along with it&quot;  (We were created for friendship)  <br>
<br>
  We had free-will at that time, but God did not create a violent, dark world for us.  That doesn't mean we had no challenges.  It didn't mean that we were to pick berries and fruit and shit all day long.  The change came when we Chose to bite the forbidden fruit.  The forbiden fruit was not a temptation.  It existed because we have free-will.  How could we have free-will if everything was not an option.  <br>
<br>
  By making that 'choice', we became part of a world where we found ourselves bound by nature, with the exception of the same old guarentee, free-will.  We chose to relive what God had already relived because we wanted that knowledge too.  Does an escaped concentration camp mother choose to send here baby into the camp so he can know what its like?  Hell no, because she loves her baby.  God, just like any loving mother or father, chose to create a world, or environment condusive for love ad truth.  But since we wanted to try it all for ourselves, we got it.   With this new 'knowledge' came experience and with experience came the inbalance of love and truth.  We had never earned truth or love so we had to attain it for ourselves now.  (ok now this is gettin gugly)<br>
<br>
Sorry if this is getting to messy.  So now humakind is still trying to understand 'life'.  In all ways.  Eventually, the path will lead us back to truth and love.  But how can one find truth all alone if God is there to help them?  Just as we have a choice, God does too.  Something similar to the opening of another dimension, God can choose to intervene, usually by way of love.  <br>
<br>
Do people feel like they literally chose just as Adam and Eve did?  No.  Did I choose to live in a dysfunctional family.  Hell no.  Same kind of shit.  Howver, there is still an open-line of communication with God.  IMO, anyone can speak with him.  You do not have to be 'saved' to communicate with God.  But ultimately, God will come to his children and offer safe haven, or salvation.  Some children might not choose this.  Eventually, the lives of communication will be severed and 'hell' will take place.  Hell, to me is a life without communication with God.  Since the form of communication with God is truth and love, some people will be fuked, quite frankly.  <br>
<br>
Quote:At any rate, Brutas, I am saying that Christians are morally week in that they (not the non-believer) never fully accept responsibility for their actions.<br>
<br>
The full brunt of life without God can over power the individual.  God knows that and will love us when we need his love.  Life as we know it is what we asked for.  I believe it is possible for someone Very Stoic to learn much from his actions.  But I don't believe anyone person has the ability to learn everything of the consequences of his actions.  Impossible.  In retrospect, which is an attempt of stopping time, allows us to realize many things.  But we are too limited and specialized to be able to comprehend the results of our actions.  On a social level we have a much better chance, but through 'history repeating itself' we can see that doens't work either.  In the extreme case, I can see what you mean.  But love makes that possible, not truth.  God can choose as well. He has free-will.  I would agree that it is not possible if we were bound by nature, but we are not.<br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen:  After all, they became Christians to escape the mental anguish associated with their behavior.<br>
<br>
  Not necasarily.  You are a good example of this.  You seek truth more than the average Joe.  A lot more actually.  You have the potential to seek truth for a long ass time.  Under the right circumstances.  But you would have to keep the validity of feelings and love at bay as it will constantly be surging with the truth you discover.  Hence, more shitty things will probably happen in response to your seeking of truth.  For the most part, you get what you ask for.  Eventually the truth will over power you and you will recognize love as equal to truth.  Thats just my opinion.  Please don't take it as negative as you well know that I have much respect for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    In more colorful terms, when seeking truth, one must intertwine their new found knowledge of truth with love in order to create balance(as is similar with space and time)  but if you keep digging a cave in search of truth, you will take it in the ass because, just like space and time are creating balance, truth and love do as well.  The reaction you 'feel' when you take it in the ass might not feel 'fair' but under the post-fruit reality, neither are your gains in the arena of truth.  <br>

 Let me ask you this, are you saying that contriteness of heart is key?<br>
<br>
  Thinking of love and truth as a system similar to space and time, I think contriteness is a result of arrogance.  I know that sounds backwards, but arrogance is a pervese form of truth and is counterbalanced by an experience that would cause most to become humble, or get booted off of their 'high-horse'.  Seeing as though love and truth exist, I see it as an environment of deer without any predators.  Eventually their population will soar only to be crashed by either disease or a lack of food.  If the environment or 'space' does not have the ability to produce a predator to create small fluctuations in competition, the deer population will become inproprtionately large and begin to ruin the environment in time.  So, extreme circumstances require extreme measures.  Nature will take care of that.  <br>
<br>
  Just like nature has countermeasurs built within itself, so do truth and love.  Consiousness, God, social standards etc....  Not that consiousness and social standards always work.  They do exist in controlling a morally balanced environment.<br>
<br>
 But all in all, I would say that contriteness of heart is very important.  Not absolutley necassary.  Salvation is offered instead of this.  This is where love becomes part of the equation.  Love from choice.  Yes, people tend to stop fighting when they feel that their ass is getting kicked beyond recognition.  But they have a choice, they can try to understand themselves.  And God will love us anyway.  I am arrogant, so it has been an important 'key' for me to realize the value of humbility.  <br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen:<br>
I AM saying that, in general, Christians are morally bereft. They are week. They &quot;sin&quot; and don't really take the consequences on the chin. They are quick to tout their forgiveness by God and walk away.<br>
<br>
  And because social reality is recognized by more than one person, 'they' would have you believe that because it is more important to them to portray a social reality than confront the reality of God.  Its much easier to play EQ than to play life, and I'm not talking about Milton-Bradley(or whoever makes that board game)  People do stupid shit.  <br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen:<br>
Non-believers in Jesus are not brainwashed into thinking sins need to be atoned for; which leads to this whole morally week &quot;sin today, get forgiveness later&quot; mentality MOST Christians exhibit.<br>
  <br>
  But its not that easy unless their intentions are pure.  This, IMO is why non-believers are potentially stronger christians than most.  I don't want to encourage anyone to become arrogant or proud but when God comes before them, they will have a huge spiritual experience(wasn't saying that athiests are the only arrogant or proud people, surely most or all people tend to be).  When people realize that God loves them and wants the best for them it is a big deal.  They, IMO realize this when they see that society's god is not the same thing as God.  <br>
<br>
  The greek philosopher who discovered the atom didn't have an electron microscope to see such a thing, but he knew it was there.  I feel the same way about the system of truth and love.  I make the choice to recognize truth and love and understand how they work independently and when it is a choice by God.  I have alot of research ahead of me but I'm enjoing it so far.  Much of what I learn is in lieu of my conversations with people, intro and retrospection, prayer and from being a part of the system God has created for us.  But I have definetly found that father-mother-child relations are very similar in the way God shows us truth and love.   Anyway, everyone is different and learns differently, develops different degrees of opinion.  Thats just how I see it and as I learn more I'm sure my emphasis will be placed on other aspects rather than a broad interpretation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uquath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/4/02 12:57:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=314>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

A lot of this relies upon the concept of free will.  And this has been debated at least as far back as Plato.<br>
<br>
Taked a person and put them in a suitation and see what choice they made.  Now rewind time and let them make a choice again.  If they make the same choice then they had no free will and were destined to make that choice.  If they changed their answer (say some kind of quantum probability) then free will is just randomness that arbitrarily dictates our life path.<br>
<br>
Humans have shown nothing inherient that makes them have to be more than complex machines.  Our brains are very intricate computers that work in a massively parallel capacity.  The goals of our brain is rooted in emotions which can be traced to hormones and neural wiring.<br>
<br>
The basic idea is we operate within the realm of physics.  If so we operate on a cause/effect basis.  In such a system there is no free will since everything is just a reaction.  Some come up with a soul to try to explain something beyone cause/effect physics and to explain free will.  However, properties of the soul become cumbersome.  Does a soul have memory?  Do souls jump from one body to the next (are they original)?  How does a soul transcend physics?  When you make claims of what a soul can do, you enter it into the realm of science and predictions can be made.<br>
<br>
If for some reason we have free will (whatever that can mean) and it is beyond God to predict, then he does not have the moral authority to judge us.  Say a man dies at age 50 and goes to hell for not repenting.  If he had lived to age 55, he may have repented and could have gone to heavan.  Since God cannot predict this and is omnipotent, then by allowing this man to die at age 50, God has judged what he does not know.<br>
<br>
Well, this is longer than I wanted, so I will zip it up for a bit.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I believe the Puritans believed you were born saved or not.  If you were saved then you acted &quot;morally.&quot;  So people would act like they were saved while believing that it would not affect the outcome of their judgement.  So in theory, you could act watever you like and it does not matter in your judgement.  What resulted is a society of very strict values which greatly discouraged immoral actions.<br>
<br>
So I think the point is that every version of Christianity is so unique that it is hard to judge whether a Christian is taking it on the chin or not.  Even Hitler had claims to Christianity and thought he was doing God's will.  I have met some Christians that know they have been forgiven by God, but also want to be forgiven by those that they wronged.  So I think it is hard to sterotype all Christians  as weak for this belief.<br>

Of course someone might make the same decision twice in a row.  If I chose to drink Cherry Coke today instead of Mountain Dew would I not have freewill if I chose to drink it again(if somehow we could reverse time)?  I see your point but choices are made for several reasons.  If someone has a gun to my head and say they will kill me in 10 seconds.  Then he starts counting down.  I am making a choice whether to bring him down,  let him shoot me, take a chance that he won't kill me, tell him he is the greatest thing since sliced bread in order to make an attmpet to manipulate his fortold decision, blah blah blah..........  One of the strongest forces for making a decision is social force.  I don't walk around naked because the law says it is wrong.  actually its kind of cold now too.  So I might say, &quot;fuk the law I don't care&quot;, but then say, &quot;damn its pretty cold outside, I'll wait till later&quot;  or I can say,&quot;I know I don't want to but I will anyway, for whatever reason&quot;  If one bases their decisions on social or natural forces, they will probably make a certain decision.  But, if there are no social forces they make a decision which is perceived as having the greatest benefit.  People have all kinds of reasons for making a choice, but that doesn't mean they don't have an option.  Im at work right now and can pick my nose and flik it in my bosses face.  I decide not to do that, while it would be very funny and satisfy me, I choose not because the consequences outweigh the satisfaction.  Realizing this, I want to delve into the unknown experience of such consequences so I'll do it anyway.  <br>

Quote Quath:<br>
Humans have shown nothing inherient that makes them have to be more than complex machines. Our brains are very intricate computers that work in a massively parallel capacity. The goals of our brain is rooted in emotions which can be traced to hormones and neural wiring.<br>
<br>
This is one of my favorites.  My resonse to you is, ok then You must not exist.  But it looks to me that you must have made an irrational decision by coming to this board.  Or mabye you posted  because it something is wrong with your motherboard?  A chemical malfunction mabye?  Hmm, I'm not sure.  <br>
<br>
Let me ask you this Quath, what is your role in the system of nature?  Everyother species has a role.  Is yours to simply eat and reproduce?  It really is an amazing coincidence that we are probably here to feel the need to have a purpose instead of having one.  Then again we have all kinds of feelings.  But what is your neural wiring forced you to post your statement?  <br>
<br>
  This is a familiar arguement.  It is one which downgrades the importance of feelings and subordinates them to thought.

I think I am missing your point over space-time: I think you are using it an example of raw nature versus &quot;cognized nature&quot; (i.e., nature from an observer's perspective). I believe you are saying that free will of individuals imposes itself on raw nature. Hence, agents with free will are not bound by the laws of nature from a moral point of view. Is that what you are saying? I think another way of looking at this (if I understand you correctly) is that there is a class off sentient beings who create moral laws because they are not bound by their natural condition. I will have to see how you respond before I can say anything over your view of space-time, or how it plays out here.<br>

Just wanted to comment that you make a very nice point above. A very good defenese of why God would provide the fruit to begin with.

Are you saying that &quot;nature&quot;, in general, has moral qualities? Are apples themselves morally bad? If a Tiger eats a zoo keeper did the Tiger &quot;sin&quot;?

And why do you think free will was exempt from this decline to nature?<br>
<br>
What is intersting to me is the ancient dichotomy of &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;Evil&quot;. Why maintain such a view? The world without social laws is neither good or evil.<br>
<br>
Also, I find it funny that God could create beings with free will, knowledge, and have them live in a paradise and his only answer to their choice to have knowledge is to take away paradise and remove the sinners from his presence?! I would say that god is not very creative at all. Seems like their should have been a better solution.

Now we get to the meat of the matter! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I don't think it is a requirement to learn all the consequences of an action in order to understand that the effects of some actions are not desirable. I don't have to shoot up heroin to understand its effects will be bad for me. We really do comprehend the results of our actions when presented to us. If we can't &quot;comprehend&quot; the results we haven't learned anything at all from our actions; hence &quot;history repeats itself&quot; for some. This is really the crux of the issue I have presented, Brutas. I am not trying to be disrespectful when I say Christians are morally weak. They are weak precisely because they never fully actualize the pain and pleasure associated with their behaviors. Should a Christian sin they quickly retreat to blaming their &quot;fallen natures&quot; and repent to Jesus for being such miserable sinners. If they do good deeds it is the grace of God that allows them to do good. In either case, the Christian never gets to deal with themselves. They never get to take credit; hence life for them is one long state of moral bereaving. Why would a god want to create such a dependancy? Why wouldn't he want his creation to take full credit and full responsibility for their actions? I will tell you, it is the god of those who created him in order to keep the masses weak and dependent. It is the Popes of the world who are responsible, it keeps them in power.<br>

This is similar to mechanical reasoning as well.  Flip a coin and see if the coin &quot;chooses&quot; to land heads or tails.  The brain is just a lot more complex but operates mechanically.  You have a lot of goals such as pride, survival, staying intact, long term survival, etc.  Your brain processes these signals and weighs in with a strategy that you execute.  It may not be a logical strategy but it is based on some computation that you may or may not be aware of.  I think intelligence is loosing its romantic feeling the more we understand it.  Chess use to be thought of as an intellectual game.  Now that computers can outperform human brains, people have mixed feelings on what intelligence is nowadays.  I think it also relates to the idea of what is life.  (There is no hard line dividing life or nonlife.  The same is true for intelligence.)<br>

<br>
As for my desire to search for the truth and to post on this board, it is still a mechnical process.  Part of the goals of my brain is curiosity and a desire to learn.  If you get a knife and knew where to cut, you could probably remove this desire from me.<br>
<br>
I remember from psychology class, a story about Phineas Gage, a guy that had a pipe blasted into his head and destroyed part of his brain.  Before the accident, he was a responsible, hard-working, fit and popular man.  Afterwards he was  nasty, vulgar, irresponsible vagrant.  Which was the true man?  Which one does his soul represent?  How would God judge him?  I think these kind of occurences show just how mechanical people really are.  If they were not so mechanical, then sociology would have a very hard time finding all the relations to people and their environment.<br>

Yes. Indeed, the nature of each mental state is entirely realational and can be quantified in terms of a functional (I believe Alan Turing was the first to suggest this). The nature of a mental state (such has having a tooth ache) is constituted by its relation to other states and inputs and outputs. If we were able to build a table of all possible mental states then we would be very close to building a logical language and terms for inputs and outputs such that we could confidentally predict anyone's behavior from any given state. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

-Space and Time is a system that exists by itself.  <br>
-Social laws potentially exist by themselves(needs more than one or some a culture to develop) &lt;----mans attempt at creation, which in its developed state can become very powerful and refined.<br>
-Order and Chaos are derivadives(bad spelling) of Space and Time.  <br>
-Love and Truth is God's law.  IMO of course God created Space and Time as well, but Love and Truth is ultimate.  <br>
-All of these systems have general and intricate process'.<br>
-The only system still in question is Love and Truth.  <br>
-In order to survive in Space and Time, one does not need Love and Truth.<br>
-In order to survive in a Social System we do not need Love and Truth.<br>
-In order to survive on a spiritual level we need the abstract laws of Love and Truth.  I mean ultimately.<br>
-Humankinds Social law is not Love and Truth.  We would like to think it is however.  But I think we can all agree that the world(In a social context) is a rather fuked up place.  <br>

-The brain is not an involuntary organ, parts of it are, but not all of it.<br>
-Generally, people do certain things.  Mathematical equations can be used to describe emotions and I can't wait till the day for someone to distinguish between values of emotion inmathematical terms.  This is something I have been thinking about sonce high school.  <br>
-BUT, I see it as a process like, information funneling into different pathways then finally coming into a final area of the brain.  A choice area if you will.  This place does not make all decisions.  I believe there is another place which acts as a kind of 'checks and balances' of this 'choice area'.  The choice area gets approval and is allowed to tell the rest of your brain to put it into action.  Of course this is all speculation and has not been proven by anyone(At least not that I know of).  The phenomena is that this 'checks and balances' part of the brain does not make any decisions, it only allows the 'choice area' the approval to officially make the decision.  Because of this, the area is not bound by anything, however I do think it can be influenced.  But this being the case, it is a variable with the value of based on experience.  AHH, that probably didn't sound like me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But without existing physically, the question of free-will cannot be asked.

Just like you said, &quot;I don't have to do heroin to know I don't want it&quot;  Or, something like that.  I see it also as someone from the world trade center on the 87th floor who got burned all over their body, learned somehting wonderful from it but won't throw his kids into a burning fire in order that they 'learn' from it too.  We discovered good and evil when we bit the apple.

Pretty passionate statement Lurikeen.  I haven't thought too much about this on a general level.  Like I said before, I tend to be arrogant so I have for the most part tried to humble myself unless I am 'The Bomb'  I am only good at a couple things.  I mean things that I have never met anyone else to be as good at.  And they are not very important in terms of status.  But I don't think there is anything wrong with screaming out loud in pride as long as it is not an attempt to differentiate between something in the way of 'good and evil', as you put it.  If you beat someone in a basketball game one on one shoudl you scream, &quot;YEA BITCH YOU SUK I KIKED YOUR ASSSSS BITCH I AM BETTTER THAN YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!!!<br>
I think there is something wrong with that.  But if you obtain a level of performance that brings you to a new level of ability or breaks you through some kind of barrier I think its fine to say, &quot; YEA MUTHA FUKA, EAT MY DICK RAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH (meanwhile punching your fist through the wall but not that you are better than anyone.)&quot;  I don't see anything wrong with, &quot;RAAA .......!!!!!!!&quot;   If your friend does something great and does the ,&quot;RAAA MUTHER FUKER&quot; then you will be happy and laugh your ass off.  If you find that your friend is doing that all the time then you might think he is getting a little power-hungry and its going to his head.  Then, there is gonna be a problem.  Otherwise,  I just can't see anything wrong with that.  Hehe, God is not the master of slavery.  <br>

<br>
&quot;-Space and Time is a system that exists by itself. &quot;<br>
<br>
Space-time is relative to observers. Without observers there would be no space-time in and off itself. Space and time are much like colors, tastes, sounds, smells, and textures. All of which are contingent upon observers.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Social laws potentially exist by themselves...&quot;<br>
<br>
I disagree. Social laws have no existence at all. One can't coherently speak of a social law existing in and of itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Order and Chaos are derivadives(bad spelling) of Space and Time. &quot;<br>
<br>
Order and Chaos are perceptions. There is no such thing as &quot;order or chaos&quot; with out individuals.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Love and Truth is God's law.&quot;<br>
<br>
Love is an emotion. &quot;Truth&quot; winds up to be what the community of thinkers agree upon. <br>
<br>
The rest of your ideas rest upon the analogy you use between space-time and love/truth. I still don't follow the correlation you want to draw here or its relevance to what I have stated.<br>
<br>
What I have gotten from what you are saying is that we have Free Will and that because we have free will there is morality. Without choice we would be automatons and there would not be a moral world.<br>
<br>
If you think about this a moment (not that you haven't at all, I mean now) you might wonder what the first humans were like before the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was made available to them. Were they just automatons? They apparently had no &quot;choice&quot; so morals didn't exist, from what you are saying. If such was the case then why did god want to change that? Because he loves us? Does that make sense? Couldn't he have loved automatons? Doesn't he love monkeys and lizards, etc? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If god created the fruit (a means to sin; hence exercise free will and create morality) because he wanted his creation to choose to love him, then isn't he a moral monster? After all, much pain has been the result of his little act just so he could get some loving. Seems pretty egocentric to me.<br>
<br>
Well, we are far off my original post on this matter. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
