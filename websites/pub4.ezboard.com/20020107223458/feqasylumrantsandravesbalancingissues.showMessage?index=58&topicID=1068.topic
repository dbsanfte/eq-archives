(Sorry)</span><hr size=1> For all you that are defending the cops, here's a story for ya...<br>
<br>
(Ed Note:I'm not even remotely trying to say that cops are bad, and that speeding isn't breaking the law, or anything.  Its a job, they do it, and they take nothing but shit from us.  But here's my story)<br>
<br>
September 17, 2001, pulled over on the highway outside Leduc, Alberta.  Now, and I mean this, I was NOT speeding.  Posted speed limit is 100km/h (approximately 60MPH) and I was doing at most 101-102km/h.  I saw the police cruiser coming from ahead, checked my speedometer, which was RIGHT on the 100km/h mark. Officer comes up to the car, I do my normal &quot;What seems to be the problem officer&quot;<br>
&quot;You were speeding&quot;<br>
&quot;No I wasn't, I was right on the speed limit, at worst within 1 or 2 km/h&quot;<br>
&quot;Get your license and registration and step out of the car please sir&quot;<br>
So I grab by docs from the glovebox and exit my vehicle and head with the officer to the police cruiser.<br>
Guy shows me the &quot;locked&quot; speed on the radar...122km/h.  Now there is NO way in hell I was going that fast, but I keep calm and relaxed...figure the less the guy remembers me the better, and I keep my mouth shut.  The officer hands me the ticket, and proceeds to rip a strip up and down on me on how I'm being unsafe and the roads don't need people like me on em.  So fine, fuckit, I sit there and eat it &amp; eventually go back to my car.<br>
Let me say this though, that fucker is gonna get the beating of his life when I get him on the stand in court.<br>
Yea, I'm fighting my ticket.  I had a calibration done on my speedometer and its bang-on the money, 0 variance.  So I know I'm right.<br>
<br>
Some of you may ask what the fuck my point is.  Well, I've done a ton of studying on traffic laws (US and Canada) and specifically Radar.  Most people have NO idea just how fallable and error prone a Radar gun is.  EVERYTHING, and I mean everything can throw off a reading.  If the officer is accellerating or decellerating.  If there's another large vehicle either in front or behind you within the radar's arc (and damnit that arc is HUGE...at 50' from the patrol car it is wide enough to cover 4 lanes of traffic).  If the officer is on his radio, or if ANYONE is on the radio, it can throw off the reading.  Metal signs, power lines, overpasses, the heater of the police cruiser, a bump in the road.  Its estimated that at least 25% of radar readings are false.  On a secondary note, police are required to take a &quot;traffic history&quot;...essentially visually determine that a vehicle is speeding, and use radar only as a tool to backup their opinion.  Average range of a radar unit is 400meters (approximately 1300')...meaning that the radar unit will go off BEFORE you are within a range that a highly trained officer can determine visually that you are speeding...the radar sounding an alert creates a bias in the mind of the officer, making it impossible to form an INDEPENDANT opinion of your speed.<br>
<br>
Yea, this is fucking long, and there's a point.  FIGHT your speeding tickets, wether or not they're &quot;legit&quot;.  All a ticket serves (except in cases of extreme speeds) is to tax you up the ass &amp; line the pockets of the insurance companies over the higher premiums you'll pay if convicted.  Quite literally, speeding tickets are a cash cow...they serve very little towards public safety.  If 1 person in 5 would choose to fight a ticket instead of just paying it, the court system would be so bogged down with speeding tickets that the government would have to do something to alleviate the pressure and find a better way to protect the people from people travelling at &quot;excessive&quot; speeds.<br>

(Sorry)</span><hr size=1> I don't think they're all dumbasses either...but I think we can do better than the current system as far as tackling excessive speeders.<br>
<br>
Hell, take photo radar.  Here's some jackass sitting in a van (that often isn't even a cop) changing rolls of film.  No demerit points issued...just a fine.  Now tell me how in the fuck that protects against speeders.  A local cop after we got in photo radar was quoted as saying (and I paraphrase) &quot;People see a police cruiser and slow down.  Photo radar allows us to punish those who WOULD be speeding since they won't have a cruiser there telling them to slow down.&quot;  So what you're saying is that you don't ticket enough people in a cruiser cause people slow down when they see it.  Sounds to me like an effective speeding deterrant (no I'm not suggesting parking cruisers everywhere).  All your photo unit does is let you ticket more people...it doesn't cause any driver to slow down.<br>
<br>
The gov't needs to figure out a way to deter speeding without lining its pockets.  And since they're making a killing off tickets now, not much of a chance of them changing their ways.<br>

(Sorry)</span><hr size=1> Near my house along the Interstate, the Arlington Police department has Parked FAKE POLICE CARS on the sides of the median in both Directions.  Why would they do this?  Because they know for a FACT that when someone sees a police car they slow down and this is wheather they are speeding or not.<br>
<br>
Now, these cars are FAKE not even real cars that are just junkers, they are FAKE..like the carbon fiber tops that Stock cars have.  For a police department to pull this off means they Know this meathod works and since they cant afford to have a cop at every intersection handing out tickets, they will do this.<br>
<br>
I think Speeding tickets are a disgrace and a plague on society.  I am not a crazy driver, and the only times I have gotten a ticket I have been around 10 MPH over it.  WTF is 75 in a 65?  thats like nothing.  There is no point in tickets like this.  Cops need to be out crusing in rough neighborhoods, solving crimes, keeping carjackers from stealing cars, making neighborhoods and street corners feel safe.  But the Fact is when you give Blue Collar workers Administrative powers, you are gonna get BIGTIME bad apples.  Cops that give tickets need to focus on peeps doing 100 and Drunk drivers and leave everyone else THE FUCK ALONE  <p><b><a href='http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=3693'>Oxoxo Xoxox</a></b> lvl 55 Evoker<BR>

Crashes of motor vehicles are the leading cause of death in the United States for people aged 1-34. From age 5 to 29, more than one-fifth of deaths from all causes are caused by motor vehicles. Motor vehicle crashes account for more than 40 percent of all mortality among people in their late teens. They cause more deaths of people aged 1-75 than any other injury-producing event.<br>
<br>
<br>
For the entire U. S. Population, motor vehicles are associated with more than 500,000 hospital admissions annually and with 57 percent of all head-injury-associated deaths. Motor vehicles have also been found to cause 44 percent of all brain injuries diagnosed by a physician, 20 percent of facial injuries treated in emergency rooms, and 56 percent of acute spinal cord injuries. The annual cost of motor vehicle-related injuries in 1985 dollars is estimated at $48.7 billion, including indirect costs (lost productivity).<br>
