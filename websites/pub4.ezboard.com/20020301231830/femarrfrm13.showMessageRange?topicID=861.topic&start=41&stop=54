If you are going to get a cloak, at least have the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DECENCY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to offer Ashrey a chance to trade you a cloak for a scale. That way, you get a cloak and Ashrey gets a scale.  I really think that's the least you could do.<br>

According to the story (i was not actually on this raid) it sounded like Indasha had told everyone repeatedly on the raid that he was receiving the first white dragonscale. No one questioned what he would do with it, no one seemed to care. It took someone who wasn't even on the raid to create an issue out of it.<br>
<br>
Indasha- Sure as hell don't turn it in. If you seriously are planning on doing that try to work something out with Ashreyl. I'm sure he could find a way to get a hold of a white dragonscale cloak if it meant he would get the dragonscale. There is approximately a 60k value difference in these (from what i've heard...I avoid EC at all costs). And btw, don't say you're helping bards around the world by selling this thing. I'm not sure there are any bards on the server who are not in a guild good enough for gore, yet have 80k to spend on a scale. Keep in mind if they can't get the scale they can't kill trak for the last piece of the epic.<br>
<br>
Whatever, it's 5am I've been up for around 27 hours and probably rambling. I merely posted on this matter because I have met Indasha before and he doesn't seem like the loot whore you all make him out to be. That's it for me.<br>

<br>
Indasha led the raid and he established the rules. If he wishes to sell the scale good for him. It seems your problem is not with who had the scale but the fact that somebody took a piece and tried to profit off of it. You seem to be retroactively making this a NBG raid even though it isn't your place to do so. Remember this raid's rules were not listed as NBG.<br>
<br>
Would you be complaining if the loot rules were FFA. I think you wouldn't, you would understand that they imply anybody getting the loot.<br>
<br>
It wasn't anybody's place to establish the rules but Indasha's, which he did. They were not Need Before Greed. It doesn't matter if he chooses to sell the scale. He won it fair and square according to the rules. To go back and complain because the rules weren't NBG isn't your place to do now. You should've said something about it when the raid was listed on the boards the first time.<br>
<br>
As far as the issue of Indasha's greed. So what? There are people who are trying to get as much pp in this game as they can. That is part of the whole concept of this game. Indasha didn't scam anyone, he didn't steal anything, he is only selling something. <br>
<br>
Would it bother you if he was selling the scale for only 100pp? It's not the fact that he is selling it or what he is choosing to do with it that is bothering you, it's the fact that he stands to profit so greatly from the piece that bothers you. In essence you seem to have a disdain for the free market system. Not the fact that he is even selling it. You chose to single out Indasha as an example. Look around you there are many people who are making profits everyday in this game. That doesn't make it bad. Rememer he didn't steal anything nor did he scam anyone. That being said, leave him alone, he did nothing wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukalvarinholyblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalvarin HolyBlade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/8/02 3:46:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=861.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Jealousy...</span><hr size=1> As much as I'd hate to agree with Indasha, he made a very good point.

I have to agree with the last few posts. Though it makes me insanely jealous to think of someone making 80k off an item, it was his item to do as he pleased with.<br>
<br>
 Though he may have said he wanted it for a cloak, then tryed to sell it, then said he woudl use it for a cloak... Would it have really made any difference to you guys attending the raid if he had just not mentioned what he wanted it for at all? Since you all attended, and he told you all many times that he got the first scale, it is his. Though I cannot speak for others, were I live we hold a democratic government wherein one's property is owned solely by themself. Once that scale dropped it became his property as was pre-agreed by all in attendance. A person (in America) has the right to do what they choose with their property. So if he said that he would make a cloak, then decided to sell it he did not steal anything. The worst that can be said is that he lied, but in fact he probably just had the scale in his bag and begain to think if he really wanted the cloak or 80k, the pp to most likely upgrade all of his equiptment and choose the 80k. Which ever happened, it is his scale and did not ever belong to the raid party. It is thusly no bussiness of the raid party or anyone else to decide what happens with it. <br>
<br>
 However, none of this is to say that I agree with reserving an item that is not even a part of your epic on a raid. But would I attend a raid with an item reserved? Probably. Would I reserve an item not for my epic on a raid I lead? No. It is a matter of each person's own idea of ethics and their own philosophies. Having said this i truely hope that everyone will realize that it is done and over with almost a month ago, and that what ever happened has happened. As much as I enjoy reading some of the well layed out arguments here, I hope that this can be simply forgotten soon. <br>

<br>
No one is saying &quot;You can't sell the scale, Indasha! We will stop you!&quot; What people ARE saying is that they won't go on anymore raids with Indasha leading them and that they feel less than nice about him. <br>
<br>
Since it can be assumed that Indasha does want to lead more raids, there are some people who posted why they wont go on any more of his. I personally think this has all one too far, but as Velondra so wisely pointed out, EQ has some philosophers playing it. In my opinion, EMarr is the server with the best nice/concerned/helpful to mean/rude/greedy player ratio. I can't back that up with statistics, i realize im just spouting, but i very rarely see/hear/read an arguement that I couldn't easily resolve by just telling both sides what the other person's viewpoint is and working out a reasonable compromise. <br>
<br>
What some people are saying about Indasha is that mentally they are putting him in the mean/rude/greedy player category. Indasha has every RIGHT to sell the scale or make a cloak or give it to Krystin Charcoal and have her say &quot;gee, thanks, I guess...&quot; but should he?: that's the philosophy question that everyone has their own answer to.<br>
<br>
Indasha's original story of I wanted to make a claok but then found someone who wanted to buy the scale makes sense with why Indasha was changing his story around so often (I wanted to get the cloak, then i had planned to sell the scale, then I didnt tell anyone what i wanted to do with the scale) It makes sense that his story would change, because he changed what he was doing with the scale right from the start. Those who have lead a raid can help me out with this statement: The number of tells you get is crazy and if Indasha knew he wanted the scale, but not what he wanted to do with it exactly, his answers could easily change from one person asking to the next. I don't blame Indasha for wanting the cloak or for wanting 80k. Reserving a scale when you arent a bard is kinda iffy, but then again, its only use isnt to make the epic so it isnt wrong.<br>
<br>
After this whole craziness i wouldnt be surprized if Indasha took a break from playing for a while. The moral of this story is: if you dont want people to question your actions, dont lead and if you don't trust  the motives of a leader, dont go. <br>
<br>
Personally i think Bards should work together and just say &quot;HELL, NO WE WONT PAY 80K!!... HOW ABOUT 30!!?&quot; and since Bards are the only ones who would pay that much the price will go down to only slightly more than the cloak. I understand the free market system though and it only takes 1 or 2 bards to pay 80k to make people think they are worth that much. I believe Norrath will eventually run out of Bards silly enough/ twinked out by their guild enough to pay 80k for a scale though and then some of the outrage will subside.<br>

He lied to the ppl on his raid as to why he wanted the scale and then stated here 3 different stories, and still is not clear on what the right thing to do is now. I dont thing he is wrong for calling loot ... only deciving ppl. <br>
<br>
End result is that I dont think he will be leading anymore raids.<br>

<br>
It is sad that someone would have to point out the fact about Bards that have 80k mostlikly are in a guild that can do gore, witch would make most ppl question so who am I going to sell the scale to? Will I be a GREEDY asshole if I do?<br>
