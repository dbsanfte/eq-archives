I immob incoming add juggs on inc. any other extras get GoKed first, tashed, and then rooted.... and say that such and such add jugg is rooted *move away*.

<br>
Not all enchanters feel that way.<br>
<br>
I find the security of a much longer mez (dazzle) to be worth any pro's entrance/enthrall might provide.  With dazzle, I have LOTS of time to get things under control.  Basically, once I land it on a mob, I can FORGET about that mez until all the CCing is done.  This is especially helpful on big Hate pulls.  The extra 24 seconds is a huge advantage.  BUT that's my opinion.  When other enchanters use entrance on raids, it annoys the hell outta me..  however, obviously, others are going to prefer entrance, and I'm certainy not going to ask them to change their style for me.  I think in the end, it boils down to not only personal preference, but also necessity for the area in question.  For now, however, entrance remains on page 37 of my spellbook.  Eh.. I digress.. this is another thread in itself.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig2.jpg><br>

<br>
What it boils down to, is you should use the mezz that allows for the fewest number of remezzes.  Remezzes = extra agro and extra mana waste.<br>
<br>
If you can entrance, and the mob is killed before you need to remez, you are using the right spell for the job.  If you constantly have to remezz and the mob is killed shortly after, you should use dazzle.<br>
<br>
The recast time on dazzle is a non issue for most enchanters, since you will normally Flux ( or shift ) on a mezz resist anyway.  Dazzle fits inside of flux , even with the recast.  If you play on a lag free connection, you can even flux - dazzle without moving ( ie with the mob in your face ).  If you have lag, you can flux , move 2 steps ( while the spell refreshes ), then dazzle.  In both cases the recast time of dazzle is a non issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only reason i use dazzle all the time at present is , frankly because im lazy.  I used to get a feel for where i was, and use the mezz spell that would cover the least remezzes.. if that was entrance / enthrall, thats what i used.. its the most mana efficient way.<br>
<br>
As for GoK and juggs, it depends on how many you get, and what your job duties are , and who you have with you.<br>
<br>
The last 3 times i have been down there it was with one group.  I had a shaman..  Even i can tank a slowed jugg, if i had to, so if there was a three pull, i would rapture one immediately, then root the second.  Tash second, tash first , then root first.<br>
<br>
Keep those 2 rooted ( shaman has slowed them by now ).<br>
<br>
On 2 pulls i would normally rapture one then tash + root if i have a shaman, or Tash + slow + root if i dont.<br>
<br>
In all cases where i say &quot; root &quot; i mean fetter, which i prefer over basic root.<br>
<br>
Ole.. i didnt say all enchanters use entrance to make a point, i say some do.  I dont recall ever working with you, so i wasnt saying you specifically were doing that.<br>
<br>
I would respectfully disagree with the fact that entrance / enthrall is always the best spell , however.  Dazzle allows the control of larger trains as well /shrug.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT : i would not reccomend for an enchanter to switch to dazzle as a primary mezz until level 53-54 or so, when you have C2 and Theft of thought, and also several levels to get the bonus on casting spells under your level.  Dazzle ( all spells actually ) are a bitch to channel when you first get them...<br>

<br>
I'm with Daeon and Llorian on this one...I prefer Dazzle just for having the advantage of not having to worry about it until all the CC is done.  Although, if I'm feeling really ballsy, and am having plenty of mana, I *do* unmem ToT and throw in Entrance/Enthrall for the backup mez if things go really cruddy.

<br>
On the topic at hand, I tend to always try to communicate with the chanters on the raid I hold or participating in. But, some cases its to hard to do everything at the same time. I.E. Mezzing, telling which are mezzed to 3 other enchanters on the raid or making sure you all use the same mez. <br>
<br>
But Communication is the biggest thing.. I've had enchanters leave raids due to it, at my own fault or the fault of others. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I don't get upset about someone mes'ing before me, as long as I'm not wasting mana.  If it's moving and not being fought, I try to mes it.  If I get &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot;, I move to the next.  I load my two highest mes's on raids, so that if one is resisted, I move immediately to the next.  I prefer the longer lasting one, so that I have the extra time to med, root, whatever before it breaks.<br>
<br>
2. I probably wouldn't know that a previous enchanter hadn't timed buffs, because the first time haste or another buff wore off, I would refresh it on everyone.  It does bother me if the cleric is taking aggro and doesn't have a rune on them, though. <br>
<br>
3. *grins*  I hope I never pick on another enchanter.  I haven't seen the dueling you mentioned though.  I never though about dueling another enchanter.  Hmmmmmm.....<br>
<br>
4. Inspect me to your heart's content.  Since I turned off seeing the message, it doesn't bother me in the least (unless you try to buy it from me when I'm not auctioning to sell it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).   No problem discussing my epic.  We have a forum board on our web site with epic progress anyways.<br>
<br>
5. I tend to do whatever the raid leader assigns me on a raid.  If I'm not on haste, but have melee in my group (and have the same haste as the enchanter assigned to it), I might keep haste on my group to lessen the burden, but that would be it.<br>
<br>
And there's never a problem with silly, fun, ignorant, or any other questions on an enchanter community.<br>

Even so, I wouldn't try.  If we were in one of the rare places that a raid could overpull badly I wouldn't care who was first, I want to live.  There really aren't that many places that more require alot of mezzing (5+ mobs in camp).  Other than Hate, Fear, and Chardok I honestly can't think of any. <br>
<br>
   If there are 2 or more enchanters on the raid I gladly let someone else be primary mezz.  If someone is assigned to primary mezz I assume it is my job to do most of the buffs and watch the for adds from the wrong direction and make sure the other enchanter isn't getting beat on.<br>
<br>
  The vast majority of the time I keep Dazzle and AoE mezz up (16th level one).  I used to think if enchanters were using AoE mezz they were just being lazy.  Now I look at it as a nice way to quickly target a mob or 2.   <br>

<br>
nah. <br>
<br>
Scene: seb disco, get a pull, and the room pops the second that the cleric lands their first heavy heal, so the pops aggro him. MT goes down, cleric goes down, ranger goes down. left with me, the monk, and a mage.... and four frogs. Lock everything down, CoH the cleric from the zone in, have him rez everyone else and them himself, get everyone rebuffed and ready to go... all while these four frogs are croaking at us.<br>
<br>
Total time chain mez'ing these frogs? oh, 10 mins or so. The aggro was no harder from what one would expect with a mez'ed mob tashed and slowed... which is what I did to them. According to the llorian "more aggro" theory, you shouldn't have been able to get them off me with a prybar.<br>
<br>
<i>and extra mana waste.</i><br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
dazzle = 1.30 mana per second of mez<br>
entrance = 1.18 mana per second of mez<br>
enthrall = 1.04 mana per second of mez<br>
<br>
<i>The recast time on dazzle is a non issue for most enchanters, since you will normally Flux ( or shift ) on a mezz resist anyway.</i><br>
<br>
depends on the situation more and more these days. I can channel through a mez on a unhasted mob actively beating on me more times than not. it is more efficent in many situations just to channel through the mez rather than dicking around with stuns or resisted stuns and attracting the attention of adds that may be beating on the tanks instead.<br>
<br>
if entrance or enthrall bounces, I don't *have* to stun to give dazzle time to refresh.<br>
<br>
<i>The only reason i use dazzle all the time at present is , frankly because im lazy.</i> <br>
<br>
Ah yes, that makes dazzle better.<br>
<br>
<i>I would respectfully disagree with the fact that entrance / enthrall is always the best spell , however. Dazzle allows the control of larger trains as well /shrug.</i><br>
<br>
entrance's cast is 2.5, refresh is 3.75, spell recovery is 2. This means it takes 8.75 seconds to mez a mob and be ready for the next one. In the space of 72 seconds ( the length of entrance )... you can mez 8 mobs and have about 3 seconds left over, assuming an ideal situation where you target instantly and have no resists.<br>
<br>
dazzle's cast is 2.5, refresh is 5, spell recovery is 2. It takes 9.5 seconds to mez a mob with dazzle and be ready for the next one. In the space of 96 seconds ( the length of dazzle ).. you can mez 10 mobs and have less than a second left over. Again, this assumes an ideal situation with no resists and you target instantly.<br>
<br>
Given real world situations, you could perhaps mez one more mob consistently with dazzle than you could with entrance.<br>
<br>
<i>Dazzle ( all spells actually ) are a bitch to channel when you first get them...</i><br>
<br>
Respecfully disagree with this statement. Chance to channel a spell is a function of your /loc when you started casting the spell, your /loc when you complete the spell[1], and your channelling score. I channel through Forlorn Deeds at about the same rate as Shiftless Deeds when a mob is actively beating on me.... which is to say, not often, but it happens.<br>
<br>
[1] try this out.... take a long casting spell like shield of magi or pet or such. back yourself into a corner so that you have a nice way to get back to your original loc. start casting the spell. Run around the room. Return to your original spot about 2 seconds before the spell completes. I've done it before where I haven't even gotten the "you regain concentration" message.<br>

I've only met a couple enchanters who can mez things faster than I can (yay DSL).  I actually feel pretty good when I manage to get to a mob before they do, because they are so darn fast.  I don't think, &quot;Oh cool I beat them!&quot;  I think, &quot;Oh cool, I actually played up to their level!&quot;<br>
<br>
As for overwriting ... there is one friend of mine who ALWAYS overwrites EVERY mez (he's 60 now).  It drives me nuts.  I will recast mez on one of 'my' mobs and will get that irritating 'your spell did not take hold' message every time I raid with him.  I think it's because he is simply used to being the only enchanter on raids.<br>
<br>
Oh, and he cheats sometimes by using Rapture on clerics in Hate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. Most enchanters, as a courtesy, will refresh all the buffs just before they leave.  When C2, GOI, etc, go, I simply cast it on myself first and start timing from there.  I never time haste, for two reasons: 1)  If I am busy I just don't want to be bothered to watch the clock to see when 24 minutes have gone by and 2) there is always one melee who will start whining as soon as the little boot icon gets blinky <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3. Nah, I never do this.  I try to be as friendly to other enchanters as I possibly can - in fact, more than a third of my friends list is taken up by other 50+ enchanters.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, one out of the five people on my /ignore list is a level 60 enchanter who completely pissed me off in a Hole group.  He was playing his warrior and kept telling me what to mez, what mez to use, what spells to mem, etc.  After the first couple pulls he asked me if I 'had a problem' with what he was telling me to do.  I said that I sure did, apologized to the rest of the group, and gated out.  He then logged his enchanter and sent me a tell - thinking maybe I would bow before his greater wisdom or something.  What an ass.<br>
<br>
4.  My items suck.  Click my Magelo profile and see!  <br>
<br>
Do not mention the 'e-word' in my presence. Grr.<br>
<br>
5.  I always talk to the other enchanters on the raid to divvy up the buff responsibilities.  Unfortunately, it usually ends up like this:<br>
<br>
Me:  So, which buffs do you want to take?<br>
Other ench: I'll take c2 - you take speed!<br>
Me: /cry<br>

Ugh that is so true, and so annoying.  I have had my epic for months and months now, and I always cast it on me then the rest of the group, and I never need reminding.  Still, in 9 out of 10 groups one or more melee will start freaking out as soon as their haste starts blinking, no matter how many times I tell them &quot;you really don't have to remind me, I refresh it as it starts wearing off every time.&quot;<br>
<br>
But what's even more funny are the casters who always let me know when their group c2 is wearing off. :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uultravoices.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ultravoices</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/26/01 3:45:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are you competitive?</span><hr size=1> <i>there is always one melee who will start whining as soon as the little boot icon gets blinky </i><br>
<br>
I self buff myself with c2. GRM is group. if I do shadow/augment,(( olenari auctions: WTB enchanter spells: Umbra, Torment of Argli, Lagarn's Lamentation, Asphyxiate )) I certainly cast those on myself. GoI and enlightenment usually get cast when I'm FM at some point, and I refresh them when I have mana to spare, not when they go away. They are mana hogs for a rather minor benefit. I can go from FM to 30 or 40 just buffing the casters with GoI/Enlightenment in an xp group. I hate being at 30 or 40 in a group where there is nothing to ToT and I'm slowing. From 30 is one nasty pull to not being able to slow the adds or Brell forbid having to stop pulling and that sucks.<br>
<br>
So... that is all the buffs that I typically cast in a group except for aq. I do all the tanks at the same time. if they are not done at the same time, I make them done at the same time. So when haste fades, I need to cast it on all of them. <br>
<br>
Most of the time I get everyone in the group telling me when haste fades.<br>
<br>
When i'm in the middle of doing a c2 cycle, I get "c2 faded". Well, hon, that is why you are seeing people sigh in tranquility around you. You'll get your turn.<br>
<br>
People tell me when GRM fades. Usually in the middle of when I'm dealing with N mobs, or when the puller is out of buff range. <br>
<br>
I used to get cross. I tried to time things more carefully, so that I would anticipate the buffs, so that everyone would be continually buffed. But that was self defeating and Not Fun.<br>
<br>
besides, is someone not going to be a hero because they don't have haste for a moment? Nah.<br>
<br>
So I've learned to be calm about this, because nothing I can do can alter it or make it stop without being a Total Bitch.<br>
<br>
Now I say "moment" or "onit" or "patience", and do it when I get a chance. and... I'm not perfect, sometimes I miss a buff fading because I was busy when it went or because everything looks the same.  <br>
<br>
On raids, its another story. If you want a buff, you send me a /tell. If I ask group leaders to send me a /tell for groupbuff, be a group leader when you /tell me... Do not ask for buffs when i'm in the middle of CCing overpull from hell... unless you are the MA/SA and need haste. Who is on what buff is outlined at the beginning of the raid. /tell the appropriate person, because I know my 60 chanters that I raid with loathe me overwriting VoG with AQ. If you ask for a buff in a public channel, I will ignore you, because I'm going to assume that some other chanter is going to get it. They are probably going to assume that I will get it. Eventually you will learn or you will do without. This is better than two or three people burning their time and mana casting the same spell over on you or trying to.<br>
<br>
unhappy raid buffing experience:<br>
<br>
it was an open hate, i went hoping for an essence drop. we had an 8 pull with lich and rat adds during the fighting, one of the chanters went down nearly right away. I was getting very low and trying to keep everything I could locked and the other chanter from dying, because it was going to be a wipeout if one of us died. In between my screams of RODS NOW!, the clerics were shrieking C2 PLZ every 15 seconds... because the chanter that went down was group c2 and on it, so everything faded at once. I didn't know it until later, but someone on the raid was using that stupid axe that proc's Word of Pain. In addition, the raid's sole shaman was /telling me every 10 seconds "c2 plz" even after I had /told him back BUSY every time. It was so close to disaster that the pally in my group has to sit on his ass and do heals for me to keep me from dying. <br>
<br>
I lost my temper.<br>
<br>
I really wanted the rubber room after that.<br>

<br>
That sounds like my last Hate raid i went to.. The higher enchanter on the raid decided to go afk for 2 hours and just put him in on the essence drop(s). ( also just was on auto-follow on certain person just incase we moved )<br>
<br>
I CC'ed everything during that raid, Thank god for the MW Mage that came with me in the same group. She kepted me Mod rodded the entire time.. That and THEN is when a mana robe comes in handy =p<br>
<br>
Needless to say the raid leader praised me a few times after the raid cause, I kept them all arrived during the 3 to 6 mob pulls. <p><center>

<br>
Not to beat a dead horse, but the recast time on dazzle is inside the refresh rate.<br>
<br>
It doesnt take 2.5 seconds + 3.5 seconds or whatever for dazzle to come back... <br>
<br>
The dazzle icon comes back about 1 second after the rest of the spells ungrey.<br>
<br>
Anyways, the reason you can lock down larger trains is because of the longer duration of the spell, IMHO.  <br>
<br>
I agree that sometimes dazzle may not be the absolute best spell for the job, but there is no way you are going to convince me that dazzle sucks.<br>
<br>
I know also all about channeling being partially a function of your /loc in the game in regards to when you start and stop casting.  Channelling is also affected by what level the spell is, at least up to 50.  I have never tested it on 51+ spells or levels , but i know i am not the only person that found new spells hard to cast, and hard to channel.<br>
<br>
Also, there was a detailed explanation given by verant on the spell casting system that stated that your chance to cast a spell ( not fizzle ), was based partially on what level YOU were in relation to the spell.  I will see if i can find it /shrug.<br>

I don't get stressed when asked for c2 and speed all the time anymore.  Some things that CAN stress me though are people that ask for haste-refresh early (like one guy will ask for speed 3 times as often as everyone else, and I know we're not getting dispelled) and now all the casters that want enlightenment all the time since we have this nefty new int/wis cap of 200 lifted.<br>

In most shitty situations with a ton of mobs its way better to have the maximum duration per mez.  Having people not able to overwrite your mez can kill on a raid.  Your very small mez/second gain is more than made up for by having to be standing and casting rather than sitting and medding.  ect. ect. ect.<br>

<br>
If ya'll really want to start talking about holding the most mobs efficiently, then both dazzle and entrance/enthrall suck.  AE Mez rules.<br>
<br>
The refresh time on a stun only comes into play maybe 1/2 the time or less.  Your assuming that your stunning between each mez.  Very often you don't have to stun at all.  You just mez, mez, and mez again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The mana cost of entrance is lower... of course if you never run out of mana this isn't to much of an issue.<br>
<br>
Communication is the key.  Implicit communication is faster than explicit tells.  So if I try to mez a mob and it tells me I can't overwrite I know immediatly ( without having to be told ) that someone has that mob under control.  When things are fast and furious that can help a lot.<br>
<br>
Also, I find a lot of times that myself and another enchanter will be casting mez on the same mob simultaneously.  If the other enchanters mez lands first, the fact that mine will bounce means that's one less mob I'll have to spend mana to keep under control. <br>
<br>
Ya'll are talking about CCing 8-9 mobs... but if you CC that many mobs for very long, your going to OOM no matter what spell your using heh.  There's a rule of thumb I try to use, optimize for the normal case.  <br>
<br>
In the normal case, short of wanting to be lazy, I think entrance is the way to go heh.  Most of the time the groups I'm in kill stuff w/in the first or second refresh anyway.  Dazzle might save you one refresh but that's all.  <br>
<br>
What it really comes down to is that everyone needs to use what they are comfortable with.  Everyone has a slightly different playstyle and depending on what your used to, you should use that.  For me, I have the timing of entrance down so it's very easy and comfortable to use.   Dazzle always lasted to long for my taste ( believe it or not heh ).  And I never got used to the extra recast time on it.<br>
<br>
I encourage all the other enchanters I'm raiding with to use dazzle so I don't accidentally overwrite their mezzes heh.  I'd encourage everyone else to use what your most proficient with.<br>
