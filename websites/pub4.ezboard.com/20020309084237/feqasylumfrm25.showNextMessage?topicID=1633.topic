Figured I'd post it here for all to read and live by.<br><br>Raid Rules<br>By Vanayr, Darxil, Zaelin and Ignoble - Tallon Zek<br><br>Note: This section might sound a bit harsh but it might come in handy with pickup raids and multi-guild raids. Probably it isnt needed in guild only raids, but it can still be an interesting read. I left it mostly unedited from the original. Fyi it was written by players from team dark.<br><br>1 - STFU <br><br>No one cares what you have to say. I don't want to hear you /shout &quot;all your loot are belong to me&quot;, because I will call lights to kill you, and I’ll pay them to do it. <br><br>No one cares what you have to say at this point. you need to keep your yap shut. <br><br>This includes, but is not limited to your uber bullshit speak about how you will &quot;own&quot; this raid, your auction of some bullshit item that no one at this level would dare equip, much less be seen still carrying, or your damn inability to stop using the /shout channel to talk smack to some idiot who wants to babble as much as you do. <br><br>2 - Speak when you are spoken to <br><br>We have been calling raid information for 20 minuets, groups are all formed, buffs are starting to be issued, and you now have no group. <br><br>If you would have shut up to begin with, you would have seen your group assignment. If you had kept your trap shut and read, you would know what chat room to log to. If you would have crammed a sock in the hole you spew garbage out of, you would know what you are supposed to do. <br><br>How many times does the raid leader have to ask you not to use /shout? When are you going to STFU and listen? <br><br>Never? <br><br>Bad dog, we don’t like that. No CoF for you. <br><br>You do as you are told on a raid. That is why you are there. You are not leading the raid, you are there to do what you are told by the raid leaders. If you are told to send a tell to RaidLeader01, you send him a tell with the information he has asked for. You do this promptly, and you don't spam him with useless blabber. We don't care about any information right now except what we have asked for, and emergencies that pop up. <br><br>Some people have to be told the same things over and over again at every raid and continue to do the same stupid things every time after being told not too. <br><br>Too stupid to listen? STFU. Go away now. You are not needed here. <br><br>3 - Your opinion on loot rules and random roles <br><br>We don't care what it is. We don't care weather or not you like it. We don't care how much you whine. <br><br>Leave now, go away. You are not needed here. <br><br>You are a (insert class here) and an item dropped you can use? Great. I don't want to hear it. Remember the rule about STFU? It's still in force. Remember where I asked what class and level you are to form the groups? Guess what this means? <br><br>I already know you are here. I know who can use what item. Stop spamming me with tells. I don’t care what you have to say about what you can use. <br><br>No, you won't random. I will do that for you, and I'll let you know who won. Don't like it? Leave, you are not needed anymore. Don't know your way back out of the zone? Not my problem, you should not have been yapping your mouth like an ass. <br><br>4 - Ninja POS <br><br>Ok great ninja looter, guess what? GM's can tell us who looted that mith mask. All your group members get a message when you loot an item. Everyone around you has already done a /guildstatus to see what guild you are in if you don't have a tag up. <br><br>Import of this? We know who you are. We know who leads your guild. We will INSURE you are miserable and have to recreate a new character if you ninja loot an item. <br><br>5 - The things you do <br><br>Everything you do represents not only you, but your guild. If you are a total fuckin moron, we will think the same of your guild. If you can't listen, we will think the same about your guild. If you ninja items, we will let your guild know, then think the rest of them are a POS. <br><br>And if you are a buffer and you don't know what the hell you are doing, let the raid leader know and he will assign someone to let you know what to do. <br><br>Is this your first raid? <br><br>Then you don't know what the hell you are doing, so ask. Don't just stand there and look retarded when someone is saying &quot;BUFF ME YOU STUPID FUK!&quot; because their buffs are wearing off since it took you 45 minutes to ask everyone else in your party what you are supposed to do and you still dont get it. <br><br>If you don't know what you are doing, be honest enough to admit it and someone else will do your job. This is the way we end up with Cleric buffs at the top fighting a mob that AE dispells <br><br>Know what? You will NOT be disrespected if you admit you are confused by the whole sceen. Those that have been on a number of runs remember that their first one was a blur. Have the balls to admit that you are having a tough time, and you will be both looked after and taken care of. <br><br>Don't like it? STFU. Go away. You are not needed here. <br><br>6 - PAY ATTENTION <br><br>Don't sit there AFK for 45 damn minutes and then bitch that you are clueless. Go away now, you are useless. <br><br>Don't log your damn 4th account on, and be clueless about what is happening. This is all your fault if you die and get me dead as well. <br><br>Logging in a buffer account? Great, thanks. The faster we buff, the faster we get cool shit. Loggin in your uber twink for that trade in GFay real fast? Get outa the damn zone please, you are gonna get me dead. You obviously have no clue. Therefore don't make me rely on you now, while you try to regain brains you never had to perform your function in the first place. <br><br>Loggin in a twink Enchanter for the raid? You need to leave. Right now, just go away. I count on you to mez and tash, not cast a damn haste spell that any Shami can backfill in the zone. <br><br>Loggin in that twink Cleric? LET ME KNOW you are a dual play char and you are not coming. I rely on healers to keep us alive, not you to be siting there doing nothing, and me left to try to figure out why I am dead now after endless /ooc of HEAL ME I AM ABOUT TO DROP HERE! <br><br>(Notice I did not say /shout? Remember what this is for? You don't? Leave, you are useless.) <br><br>7 - My time and your time <br><br>My time is valuable, do you have respect for that? No? Leave, you are useless. Have the decency to respect the time and effort that is required to plan and execute a large scale rade. <br><br>Don't start in /ooc 10 minutes into getting the raid organized you are bored. It takes some god damn time to get everyone in the proper group with the proper buffs. <br><br>If you don't have a fucking half hour to spend sitting around waiting for everything to get organized get your ass back to OT and continue soloing. <br><br>Another thing for you. Raids are designed to do things as a group, not to cater to your own version of how life should be in EQ. Guess what? If you complain that there isn't any decent loot or good exp in what we are doing, your ass won't be invited back for the next event which may involve getting the loot you need. <br><br>Have a bad attitude? See that cool screenshot of the A_Uber_Weapon_01 you want? Print a copy and tack it to your forehead cause that is as close you are gonna get to seein it in. <br><br>8 - Your opinions after the raid <br><br>This is when your raid leaders turn back into regular human beings. This is when you send them a tell and let them know any comments you have. This is when you get a response to your concerns. This is when we have common courtesy and hear you out. <br><br>Do it during the raid? STFU. Leave. You are not needed here. <br><br>-Recap- <br><br>Keep your mouth shut <br>Do as you are told <br>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this <br>Listen closely <br>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this <br>Don't train and get us all killed <br>Pay attention to /shout, your raid leaders use this <br>Don't be a peice of shit ninja looter <br>Don't whine in OOC that you don't understand the loot rules <br>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this <br>Don't be an idiot and use SolB, PoF, PoH or PoG as your auction spot. <br>Don't go AFK for any extended period of time. If you are AFK, let someone know. <br>Have patience and respect for people who are working hard for you <br><br>Aon <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uakbarbelakesh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akbar BelAkesh</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/8/01 4:50:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1681.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid rules</span><hr size=1> These raid rules are deplorable.
