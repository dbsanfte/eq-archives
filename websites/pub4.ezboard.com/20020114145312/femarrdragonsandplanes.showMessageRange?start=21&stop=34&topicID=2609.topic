Then again guess since most of those were much more explosive than this situation it makes a difference.  Still I don't see the point of bringing it to public attention without saying names.  If you can then I hope you don't knock yourself over clapping yourself on the back and clamboring around the druid to join in on the self adulation of your thoughtful posts.<br>

*sigh*  Why do so many people think of druids this way.  I almost never charge for ports, though I do accept donations sometimes.  Only time I really accept donations is if it is a item (such as a gem) that I have use for.  I give gems to my IG wife for her crafting.  If someone puts some plat into the window, I usualy cancel, unless I'm down to my last 300ppish, and it is a decent size amount.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to what I was gonna post.  It is like for instance, a cleric rezzing someone, and them telling the cleric before the rez that they didn't have any money for the rez, while the cleric wasn't planning on accepting a donation anyway.  TNice druid sees auction... Nice druid gets like all other quad kiting high on themslves me first druids and thinks:<br>
<br>
&quot;Well hell... I think i need to rant because I dindt get some of his last 300pp&quot;  Then after they are rezzed, shouting &quot;Donating X ammount of plat for port to Y location&quot;.  I bet that would probably make the cleric mad, just cause the fact that the person lied to them about not having any money to donate.  People don't like being lied to.<br>
<br>
It is like when a couple has sex... Say the woman says she has an orgasm, but the man later finds out that the woman was lying about it.  He is gonna be mad just cause she lied to him, not cause she didn't have an orgasm.  It is that simple.  (I'm sure many men have had this happen to them.  Not saying all woman lie about it, nor am I saying all men will get mad about it, so noone start saying &quot;I don't ever lie about it&quot; or &quot;I never get mad&quot;.  This is just an example, and if it is in no way related to what happens to you, don't start bitching about how wrong this example was.)<br>
<br>
People just don't like being lied to, it is that simple.  It makes them frustrated, and less trustworth to the person(s).  I'm sure Lovebite isn't mad that she didn't get some plat, but she's just mad that they lied to her, and wanted to rant about it to make her feel better. <p>"There is only one quality worse then hardness of the heart, and that is softness of the head."

And who better to vent to than my peers? I also posted because I was hoping he read the boards, would see this, and if he was lying (which I believe still), he might think twice about it next time.<br>
<br>
As to the BOOB who has a prob cuz I didn't name any names: 2 reasons. 1 being I didn't want to be judged because &quot;Poster_01&quot; had known *some guy* since `88 and there is NO way schmucko could have done that (Hey...I will admit to having my mean, bitchy, lieing, jealous, schemeing moments...but I usually try to hide such shameful behavior from my friends. PPL have FACETS! And that's what makes em glorious.) 2, hey...maybe I was wrong and he had a perfectly legitimate reason that it looked like he was lieing to me. I don't really think so and but I try not to think in absolutes...so on the off off chance he wasn't I didn't want to make it look like I was trying to smear his rep or bash his guilds rep (he can do that all on his own! oops..petty Lovebite has come out...down girl!).<br>
<br>
Ahh well...this gets more convoluted as time goes by doesn't it? I thought I was being lied to, got a little steamed, came to check out the dragon raids, thought about it somemore and how stupid it was, got a liitle more steamed, and posted here. If it's so lame, don't post here, and the thread will be gone in 24 hrs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The point of auctioning for a friend might be that the &quot;friend&quot; is offline or off on a raid somewhere and has no time to auction for the item themselves, pops up in my guildchat all the time &quot;can you see if anyone is selling item XXX while you are in commons&quot;, so yes it is feasible that they may have been auctioning for a friend. <p><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/rolesig.gif">
