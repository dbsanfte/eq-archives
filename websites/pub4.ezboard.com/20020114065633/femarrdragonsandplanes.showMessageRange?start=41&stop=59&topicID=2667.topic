2) I'm in Canada, fag. Thanksgiving was a month ago.<br>
<br>
If the best comebacks you can come up with are still ones along the lines of "you have no life and no job", then you <b>really</b> are even more of a tool than I ever though. Oh no, please don't say I have no job. Please, don't. It hurts so much. Really. It does. <p><BR>

<br>
Let us start off by saying that I'm only a member in VP and I represent my own voice, not the guild voice.  *cough* I'm also not half as so diplomatic as Theodwyn, but I'll keep it civil.<br>
<br>
Diwa, people get flamed on here.  You post something, /someone/ will flame you.  Just as it is your right to rant, others have the option to flame.  It should be well known that you come to this board at your own risk.  Getting flamed, however, is no excuse to losing your bearings and forgetting who you represent when you add &quot;Vivix Protectorate&quot; to your EZ sig.<br>
<br>
The difference between a rant and a flame is that the latter is targetted towards an individual or multiple individuals.  There is no conspiracy here.  I've lurked around these boards quite some time myself, and let me tell you, these people have better things to do than petition for someone to be kicked out of Vivix Protectorate.<br>
<br>
It is safe to say that the reason Diwa was deguilded was because of the way she represented not only herself, but the guild as a whole, when she flamed.  The tone undertaken the said flames was quick to accuse and lacked level-headedness and objectivity, which didn't bode well with VP.  <br>
<br>
Prior to the most recent event which lead to Diwa's discontinued membership to VP, there was another time Diwa's flames led to her getting a warning.  This isn't the first time.  In my sole opinion, the officers of VP were VERY, VERY patient.<br>
<br>
Alas, tough love doesn't always work its magic.  Diwa, hun, I'm sorry it had to be this way.  I'm also going to risk our friendship to say that this really was not anybody's fault but yours.  You started the accusatory mud-slinging and ego-wars.  Warnings were issued, but then ignored.<br>
<br>
There is more to say, but it will be saved for another time.  I'm sure other VP will agree that if there are more issues that need to be addressed on this topic, I suggest, Diwa, it be taken to the Vivix Protectorate message board.<br>
<br>
Good luck and best wishes to you and yours, Diwa.<br>

     I never got to group with you or anything like that, never read any of your flames... er posts at all... until this thread. I personaly have spouted off my fair share of crap as well, what, this is the 18th post for me? I usually get what I expect from this board, Flames and Rants, I spout off what I'm thinking about things at the moment and I don't have to worry about regretting it since someone is going to take offence to it (or find it funny as hell ... or even stupid) and make a comment about it themselves, thereby making something for me to shoot off at the mouth again... wow. This is totally off my first point, screw that thread, back to my original comment.<br>
<br>
    Just reading your posts here, I have realised a few small points.<br>
<br>
1) Someone thinks VP sucks and while that may be thier opinion and they are entitled to it, They can still pissoff.<br>
<br>
2) I am old enough to hold a job and I AM at home without my family on Thanksgiving and am quite content at the moment, so your comment about the previous post, was totally unfounded.<br>
<br>
3) While I may not be able to type that well, whether (sp) I'm in a rush or not (and no, I don't have a dictionary handy) I tend to try to write/type ledgibly for others, so they can read my tripe clearly. I have noticed that your posts are a little confusing to me.<br>
<br>
4) Follow through with what you say your going to do. Don't post here again after you say your not going to, it shows a lack of resolve to follow through with your on word.<br>
<br>
       Now, I know you have taken this as a personal attack on you, but I don't honestly think I flamed you. But respond however you will, I played with matches as a kid (and still do) so you can go ahead and flame me, I'll just return fire. (pun intended)<br>
<br>
       Happy Thanksgiving to everyone ! Have a great holiday!!<br>

You see what people are talking about?  You may not have meant it to be, but you sound like you are flaming anyone what happens to be younger than you.  You may not have meant it to come across this way, but that's how what it looks like.  Presentation is everything.<br>
<br>
And no one here is to blame for getting you kicked out of your guild but you.  There are so many people who refuse to take the responsibility for their own actions and this is a prime example.  YOU BLEW IT!  No one here MADE you post anything.  Suck it up and get over it.  Bitching and whining here is not gonna help you in any way. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

<br>
I played before I joined a guild and I will play after I am not in a guild.  I am in this game for the fun not the politics.  Whatever happens in the future happens.  I care about my actions IG not what is said on a Rant and Flame board.<br>
<br>
I see some of the crudest and obscene langauge being used here but its ok for only some people to use it.<br>
<br>
I made the age reference because I know what fisariks age is.  I didnt know he was from canada.  I was stating he should be enjoying the holidays before he cannot enjoy them.<br>
<br>
My point has been many people in guilds are allowed to use words like &quot;tool&quot; or other vulgar language yet when I respond the same way that I am treated I am to blame for it?  Why because they are part of a &quot;clique&quot;  and because they are they can affect my IG relationships?  Its nothing more than a double standard.<br>
<br>
I didnt respond to this post in a couple days in hopes it would just go away.  Look at how many posts after mine there were?  Yet someone regardless of what country, age, sex, etc they are from knows its a holiday (being from buffalo I know lots of friends from Ontario and Toronto and have reletives up there that do celebrate Thanksgiving) yet don't have the tact to just let it go. <br>
<br>
It took Fisarik a person who frequents these boards that long to get his shot in one me?  Did he really need to?  Or was he doing it just because everone else was?<br>

That hasn't been your point. You change your point every post. Find one and stick to it. The reason "you are to blame for it" is because of your responses to EVERYTHING. You write a long winded bullshit post about your feelings on people giving you advice, Everquest, the boards in general, and the players of EQ. You bitch at those who offer you advice, you flame those who say anything that contradicts your own opinion, and you show an overall lack of respect for every single person in the "community" (in quotations because you've already expressed you don't look at this as a "community").<br>

Hawaii you insinuate everyone who even glances at this board has no life / family just because they glance at this board on a holiday...when &lt;gasp&gt; yer here BUT  you have an excuse.<br>
<br>
Please I have no cliche here whatsoever.  Half of these people might vaguely have a clue who I am and the same is true of myself I have a vague clue about half of these other people.  Difference is most of these people have their IG friends myself included and can come here and spout off because A. They only offend one or two other sets of peeps not EVERY FUCKING MEMBER.
