you decide</span><hr size=1> OK. My post is based on the assumation that what Seolblade has posted is the way it went down. If somehow that is not the case then I appologize and you may ignore my post most thoroughly.<br>
<br>
First off I am one of those who helped seolblade do the first fight. I did not know him but was there to do the fight for my friend Draelyn and Draelyn had been talking to Seolblade and had gotten information from Seol that helped Drae on the quest so Drae and I were more than happy to help do the fight twice for Drae then Seolblade. <br>
<br>
Now to the part about LoR owning the shield.The guild helped on 1/10th of the quest and he had  by his account asked for help many times before and recieved the standard blank answer most people get when they ask for help in a lot of guilds. If 1/10th of the help is considered ownership then you all are out of your mind. Did the guild help kill the thought leeches for the brains/ toilers for the charcoal/burning priest/camp for approx 6 hours the vah shir heads/first fight of 8 mobs? Nope you helped with a fight that takes 10 minutes and is easily done with 1 healer and 2 tanks above 55 and you claim ownership? This was not a raid where 30 people help kill a mob so that that one person who gets an item is only 1/30th responsable for them having the item. Even though I do not agree that LoR should have any type of ownership of the item I also do not agree with you selling what your guild did help you aquire even if they only did help on 10% of it. <br>
<br>
I speak for myself and not my guild. The opinions I am about to speak bear no markings representing Divine Grace in any way, they are just me speaking my mind.<br>
<br>
Evelle. If you did keep that book and give it to an officer and it was loaned to you till you had better or he reclaimed it if he needed to sell it then I would ask you to do the same and relenquish almost all loot you recieved while in DG that was obtained via any of DG's help. If droppable give it to an officer of DG for reallocation if no drop please destroy 29/30th's of it since you did 1/30th of the work approx. if it was obtained on a raid of any sort be it halls of testing or a boss raid. You could keep 1/30th as 1 out of average 30 people on a raid you did 1/30th the work. If you truely believe in guild ownership enough to take what was loaned to you that was in no way owned by the guild as a way to reclaim an item you all helped about 1/10th to get then you would happily do so out of your own morals. If you do not then you should appologize and get the book back to Seol with much haste and sorrow. As I stated before this is not the outlook of DG but my own opinions. If what seolblade said was true and he loaned you the book and you gave it to an officer of your guild to hold as &quot;Payment&quot; till you all got &quot;Your Shield&quot; back when all you did is 10% of the work for it then you should do the same for your own gear epic/epic pieces etc. and divulge yourself of them.  <br>

The only help you needed with this quest is really with the final two battles. You solod the Burning Priest(of your own accord), the leach brain is also solable(easy mobs), and the the toilers part can be done doing normal exp groups in Maidens Eye. <br>
<br>
The problem with when he asked for help is that it was always while the guild was in TOV or on another raid. <br>
<br>
I don't blame Evelle for keeping the book. She helped you obtain a very cool shield and then logs on the next day to find out you are selling it. Thats not what she helped you for.<br>
She helped you to upgrade your equipment. And the excuse that it's pp for your epic is crap. We got you a jade reaver last week so obviosly we were helping you get that too. There are many many people in LoR and you can't expect to get help every time you ask. Sometimes you have to wait. <br>

<br>
This is not a personal attack on Evelle or any of my other friends in LoR as i liked almost everyone in the guild.<br>
<br>
But like it or not i can/will do whatever i want with anything i have obtained.  im not a KS/er i dont scam anyone and was happy to let my guild members use my items.  Just because i use my time and energy trying to get my epic without having to rely on the guild is my personal decision.  And one i will stand by.  Are they trying to say they have NEVER sold/traded anything obtained through guild raids or guild groups?   BULL****<br>

But let me the one who didnt raid alot or be there port bitch when im BUSY doing other things be made to look like an ass.<br>

You know as a whole i loved that guild, but when someone tries to tell ME what i can/cant do i have a problem.

  You come on this board to try and tear down a guild for getting up set with you for helping you obtain an item,  then selling the next day.  I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this &quot;rant&quot;.  I think most people would be upset with you for what you have done.  You begged and pleaded in guild chat for assistance on this quest(yet the only assistance you have given the guild is on a raid where you had a chance to progress your epic).  When begging for help you kept on telling people how nice of an item it was, if it is so nice then why are you selling it.  After killing the VSR for litel's epic progression, we also looted an extra VS stone that was supposed to go to you for your epic even though you were not present on the raid.(admittedly i am not sure what happened to it after that raid)<br>
<br>
   Adarian,  Please tell me when anyone said anything about &quot;guild ownership&quot; of the shield.  No one in the guild has claimed that the guild owns the shield.  People are upset that he mislead the guild and used guild resources to obtain an item, and less than 24 hours later tries to sell it on a public board.  If we were claiming Guild ownership of anything then we you would see us asking for the JR that he obtained on a guild raid.<br>
<br>
   I dont think that any guild would appreciate or condone Seolblades actions.<br>

This is one of the stupidest things I've seen on this board in weeks.  Your millitary service has exactly zero to do with your relationship with your guild, and your attempt to use your service as a means to shame others into serving your purposes is disgusting.<br>

Give him the shield and the book, and the fact remains he still deceived and mislead those who helped.  And *That* people is what LoR as a whole is upset with.<br>

This is none of my damn business. Nor is it the business of anybody else who is not in LoR. Does LoR have a message board? If not, I guess I could see posting some of your concerns here, but not in this flaming tone. If yes, I must agree, this is in very bad form, and does no good for you, or anybody for that matter.<br>

Care to ask this question again? <br>
<br>
Answer: Because of shit like this. You are no-good theives.<br>
<br>
You people never do any wrong. (At least in your eyes) I should have know you would pull this &quot;I thought it was a gift&quot; -HORSESHIT! You have already stated you were holding it for the shield. You did NOT HAVE TO HELP him with the final fights for it, I can't stand people who hold favors over your head. I have a few friends in League of Ronin, and I implore you to get out, or stop whining to me about it. You have already complained to me about how this guild uses you for their own personal gain, then leaves you out in the cold when you need something. This guild can eat shit, die, then the surviving members can eat the dead shit infested rotting corpses and die themselves.<br>
<br>
Thanks a bunch.<br>

<br>
1) I never asked  or had to ask for anyone's help when leading raids, actually had to turn some away because I had too many.<br>
<br>
2) It wasn't a guild raid. It was pickup. BIG Difference.<br>
<br>
3) There were a hell of a lot more items that drop than the  pally book. People had a chance to get stuff as well.<br>
<br>
4) I never reserved an drop on any of my raids. Got my Nag book chained in the end because none dropped in 10 straight kills.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nice try though. <br>

Seolblade used guildies to gain a high end item then 24 hours later it's on the items board for sale. Thats complete bullshit and he was removed for it. So that makes us all thieves? I think not. If you have a problem with a specific member then deal with that person. I am not a thief and neither is anyone else in LoR to my knowledge. I don't appreciate the implication and I doubt anyone else does. Infact I have been nothing but nice to you ever on either one of my characters. <br>

Somehow I think people showed up for tasty dragon loot, not to help Kerna get his book... don't pretend he was some kind of charity case when you showed up looking to win a CoF/scale/whatever.<br>
