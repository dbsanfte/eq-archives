I've kept myself from being insulting in my previous posts even though this is rants and flames, yet I get 2 year old responses in return. I didn't bother to pay attention to this person's name other than it begins with an A and ends with an N and I'm too lazy and annoyed to go back and look.<br>
<br>
So here it is. You don't like NBG, that's readily clear in the way you disregard any coherant arguments looking for anything you can toss out as an inconsistency.  You want to random for every piece of shit loot that drops? Fine man whatever...I've destroyed better junk than OS drops.  I went into Kunark with better items than 90% of the shit that got introduced so maybe my viewpoint is a bit different.  I raid for any new items I get, the most plat I've ever had in this game is 10k because I really don't give a flying fuck what any of you think...plat is a worthless commodity useful only for reagents and food. <br>
<br>
To you a coherant argument for NBG is one that would convert you into thinking, yea I see the light man.  Anything else is just some piece of dog shit lying on your morning newspaper.  So here's a little english education from a science major.  A coherant argument is an argument that, for the most part, follows the same line of thought and strives to show examples in favor, and demonstrate a better understanding of a specific viewpoint of a topic.   Just because You don't Want to aggree with me doesn't automatically invalidate My side of the argument.  It just means You don't aggree with Me.  Did I ever say I didn't see your side or that you were full of shit? Nope...even though honestly I feel that way because I really don't give a fuck who gets a goddamn bonecaster robe or a fungi tunic honestly.<br>
<br>
So you played since beta 4...wooptie shit, let me get my damn autograph book because you're a rare fucking spawn.  By your own admission, however, you don't have a single level 60 character.  I don't give a crap how many level 53ish chars you say you have or how much played time you say they've got.  From these examples I can only assume you'll be farming OS with your geek squad you've built until the new dungeon to be farmed comes out with Luclin.<br>
<br>
Judging by all these statements of your's I can only assume that you hate NBG because of the times it screws you from the phat lewts.  Also, if you really do have all these chars of your's...how can you justify that you &quot;need&quot; the sweat off a dead halfling's balls when you can't even commit to level 1 of those characters after all the time EQ has been out?  Oh wait..nm..can't farm nag/vox if you level them all over 52...coincidence? I highly doubt it.<br>

Well this whole rule thing must have been enforced while I was my break. But as far as I recall, with a lot of people it was ALWAYS this way.<br>
If people wanted to roll on items that they couldnt use, I would roll against them, and if I won, would have given it to a person who could use it. Why? Because it's the right thing to do.<br>

IMHO.<br>
<br>
The only thing you can really plan to camp for is XP, and sometimes that doesn't work out.  You may hope for phat lewt, phat lewt may actually drop - but in the end the only thing you can count on is XP.  Anything above and beyond that is extra.<br>
<br>
NBG allows you to allot that extra to the person who is most immediately improved by it.   Allotting it to someone that will sell it has no immediate effect and will likely not have an effect for some time, as they are busy selling the item and the plat they gain will rest in their bank.<br>
<br>
Poppen hits it on the head, though maybe the word choice is a bit off.  It is about honor, of a sort.  It's about enjoying the fact that you helped another person out, knowing that gear is nice but in the end the pixels mean nothing.  Also, it's about not worrying that some "lootwhore" got the better of me, because it's just pixels.  <br>
<br>
I'm no worse for it, they're still a greedy "whore", I move on... I didn't lose anything, I just saw the bad side of humanity.<br>
<br>
When that fungal tunic drops and the monk gets it from a NBG policy how is anyone else robbed?  The fact it dropped is pure luck - no one laid claim to it before, as probable as the drop is you still can't plan on it.<br>
<br>
It's simple.  You didn't gain anything, but you didn't lose anything either.  <br>
<br>
But, if you play by NBG you get to know the joy of helping a fellow player out - giving that cleric his first bit of donals, that warrior an upgrade to his ykesha, the caster a step up from his O robe.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes you get burned, but that's life, get up, grow up, move on.<br>

<br>
Don't roll for things you don't need, unless others in the group are. If you win, give it to the person that needs or a guild mate that needs. <br>
<br>
Discourage people in your group from rolling on things they don't need. <br>
<br>
The possible exception to this...if going to camp an item that isn't for you, in the interest of a friend. But the only way to do this fairly is to make it clear to the group before hand. Even then, I still might give the item to whoever in the group needs it, if I win. <p>Arnwolf Magnuson<BR>

<br>
Wrong. The scientific definition of a coherent argument is one which starts with a set of axioms upon which all parties agree, and then makes inferences from them which eventually lead to an indisputable conclusion.<br>
<br>
This is what I've tried to do. I've given a number of reasons why I think NBG is unfair in a generalised manner, rather than rattling off some sob-story about an underequipped shaman or something.<br>
<br>
For every example you can invent of a situation where NBG is fair, I can invent one where NBG is unfair. So giving examples doesn't further your point at all.<br>
<br>
The only person who's actually presented a logical or well thought-out argument for NBG so far is whoever it was that said NBG is for making friends (on page 3 or so?). And I'll concede that point to him - if you're worried about befriending the people in your pickup group for the longer-term, then NBG makes sense (I've said earlier that I agree with NBG in guilds and between groups of friends so it may as well also hold with people you want to make friends with).<br>

My intention there was, in fact, to show that I'm not a powergamer in terms of either levels or loot. I wasn't boasting - I'd imagine the vast majority of people who played beta have more levels and better stuff by now than I do.<br>

Firstly, at no point in this thread have I said I need anything so I'm not sure what you were referring to there. Secondly, as I said in my last post, I don't generally stay in exp groups long because I happen to find them intensely boring.<br>

Some people think FFA is fairer then NBG, some think vice versa. So dont even dare call them a greedy whore because their opinion is different. They're just trying to be fair in their own way. They're trying to be fairer then you, whatever your opinion.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Im against NBG for a few reasons. The main reason is this sort of bullshit. You'd be surprised to know that some servers haven't even heard of NBG and even more surprised to know that they don't have this argument.<br>
<br>
I can show you a number of reasons why NBG doesn't work. I can show you a number of reasons why FFA doesnt work. But both arguments depend upon people with no honour.<br>
<br>
Need before greed is abused daily by people who hide those weapons to roll on another. By tanks who intend to sell their new armour that just dropped. By casters rolling on items and spells they already have. The list goes on.<br>
<br>
Its very difficult to abuse FFA. If every camp was FFA then there wouldnt be an issue would there? So I win a caster robe and not a mellee item. Well then maybe more selling and trading would happen in EC then repeatedly auctioning of an item. Everyone goes to East Commons to sell things..but for every 50 people selling something you have perhaps 2 buying something. Thats never going to work.<br>
<br>
If I win a bonecaster robe I can trade it for the haste item I want and the caster invariably wins because they depend on gear less. So a dragon raid im on gets a book of frost and the cleric wins it. Im sure I can buy a book of frost with the money I get from selling the red dragonscale and so on. The chain never ends.<br>
<br>
Verant intended their to be trading in this game and some servers put this rule of NBG in and it does not work. You can say it does work and you can quote your examples but we can all quote examples of how people ahve cheated the system. It may work in guild but it does not work in the open game.<br>
<br>
In guild I'll happily defer mellee items to the main warrior because he is going to be taking all the hits. He needs the greatest AC and HP. But in turn I expect him to help out with the other stuff. I expect him to say...well ok,..heres an item thats a 2AC upgrade for me but 12AC upgrade for Kerryn..how does it serve the guild best?<br>
<br>
But I won't roll on an item thats 25 AC upgrade for me when the main tank is going to gain an amount of AC that is clearly going to make him better.<br>
<br>
Guys..I'd like to make things fair and I'd like to believe that we were all in it for the good of the server. But we're not. It's never going to be fair and NBG just opens too many of those doors to abuse. Id say that the server is split almost down the middle. Some advocate NBG whilst the others don't.<br>
<br>
But 95% of the server puts up with NBG because of the 5% of people who have to scream what loot whores we are. <p><HTML><CENTER>

I agree wholeheartedly. NBG is fair. Which means its good in theory. But the people spoil it. Which means it's not good in practice.<br>
<br>
So, given that FFA is totally random would you agree that it is fair? That everyone has an equal chance to win every item? <br>
<br>
I'll come back when I get some answers to this question.<br>

Most of the spells that drop in OS are for levels 51-55.  Ever since Verant raised the drop rate for those spells, they've been virtually worthless.  The 56+ spells drop off of Emperor Chottal, Reets and Juggs, and probably Trakanon and Tolapumj.  Those are the spells that are really worth something.<br>

<br>
That doesn't make any sense.  Just because you aren't &quot;robbed&quot; doesn't mean you didn't lose anything.  If your group didn't follow NBG, you would have a one in six chance of winning the tunic.  That has value.  When you surrender your chance at the tunic by following NBG, you have made a sacrifice.<br>
<br>
The Fungi King spawn is an especially bad example for the point that you are trying to make.  Very few groups would camp that spawn if the tunic did not drop.  The experience is mediocre, the camp requires a tough break-in, and the CRs are very difficult.  There is no other loot worth talking about.  When people go to the King spawn, they are usually going with the hope of winning the fungi tunic.  If one or two (or more) members of the group claim NBG, the chances of anyone else in the group getting a tunic are remote.  Don't tell me that the other members of the group aren't losing anything, because they are.<br>

<br>
Oh, give me a break.  If NBG really helped out poor, needy players, that would be great.  However, there just aren't that many warriors coming to OS with Yaks, nor are there many clerics who don't have something better than Donal's (as most people have figured out, Donal's is crap except for the BP and legs), nor are there many casters in O robes.  Most of the time, NBG gives a valuable item to someone who is already well equipped.  I can't say that gives me a lot of joy.<br>
<br>
I follow NBG because I prefer to play in a cooperative environment, not because NBG is fair.  There is no coherent argument for the fairness of NBG, because NBG is not fair. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchukzombi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chukzombi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Undead Shaman</span><br>  Posts: 1785<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/29/01 8:21:28 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/chukzombi/CHUKTS.JPG 60x60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> Well since this thread has gone way too long one more post wont make a difference.<br>
<br>
First off i want to start by saying i am out of the loop. i dinged lv 60 last October and have maybe been to OS 10 times since then for exp.<br>
<br>
So the very very rare occasion you see me in OS is becuase im about to lose my level and i happen to be in the neigborhood and wanted some easy exp filler.<br>
<br>
All my non guild groups are pickup groups. I have no clue who im grouping with and i dont care to know.<br>
<br>
When some item or spell drops, i always pass,  I have better, if for any reason the item is shaman  usuable and somebody asks me if i need it , i always say , id only sell it destroy it or give it to a twink. ill pass.<br>
<br>
I think alot of the reason people seem so greedy now are becuase this server is getting old. people want all the nice things that an old timer like me have and want it all five minutes ago. Forget the fact ive been working on my gear for over 2 years now, forget that ive learned every dungeon firsthand and not by reading a spoiler. The average new player surfs EQ-lizer and finds out where the best loot is then levels themself in the best zem giving dungeon and then rushes for OS in a mad dash for the touchdown (that being all the l33t l3wt)<br>
<br>
The worst sight i seen was this past friday on my way to pick up some bat wings and fuzzlecutter formulas i passed through east commons and immediately got hit with a wall of lag. WTF, i do a "/" and there are 160 people in EC, all buying and selling phat l3wts. I dont know whats more lame  grubbing for every item that a mob drops or spending a friday night spamming /auction's in a zone and not even playing or having fun.<br>
<br>
So i just pass on all items  let the grubbers have their loot if it makes them happy and i get my experiance so i can die 20 more times the following week without losing my level, then im happy.<br>

<br>
I think that goes to show the difference in experience.<br>
<br>
Nearly every group I played with in OS was a pickup group.  And more often then not there was someone that was especially lacking, or behind the equipment curve.  Your "Oh, give me a break" shows you are more of cynic than I, but your experience or "take" on OS (or any dungeon for that matter) is no more valid than mine.<br>
<br>
And your definition of sacrifice is much broader than mine.  Losing a chance at something to me doesn't equate to sacrifice, since it is, by definition, chance.<br>
<br>
Again, the only thing you can count on, since you missed the point... and even at the king spawn.. is XP.  Everything else is extra.   The choice of spawn is irrelevant, really.  Be it d1, d2, king, or any spawn on the face of norrath, the only thing you can count on is xp... good, bad, fast or slow, it's the same thing.   The speed of the xp or the value of the drop doesn't change that.<br>

And does NBG allocate valuable items to that person?  No, it doesn't.  If the poor, pitiful shaman mentioned in other posts is in an OS group when an RBG drops, does the shaman get the RBG so he can improve his equipment?  Not a chance.  If the shaman tries to participate in a roll on the RBG, he gets a sermon about the virtues of NBG.  And so the poor, pitiful shaman has to watch the RBG go to some tank with a pair of Lams and high-grade armor.  Call me a cynic if you wish, but this is the source of the bitterness that you see in a lot of these posts.<br>
<br>
NBG allocates items based on the group members' need for the particular item, not based on their overall need for equipment.  Now, add in the fact that the most valuable equipment in zones like OS is for the melee classes.  (That's Verant's fault, but it's still a reality.)  The result is a system that allocates loot unevenly and haphazardly and that is frequently abused.<br>
<br>

Suppose you enter a sweepstakes with a grand prize of $1 million.  Your number is selected as one of the six finalists for the prize.  If you decide to tear up your ticket and let one of the other five finalists take the money, are you making a sacrifice?  After all, you're only losing a chance at the money.<br>
<br>
I doubt that very many people share your view that the loss of a chance is not a meaningful loss.  Otherwise, we wouldn't even be having this discussion.<br>

I see your point, but I don't think it has any validity.  Sure, loot is never a certainly in zones like OS.  But so what?  Once an item drops, it has to be allocated to someone in the group.  You can follow NBG, or you can let everyone in the group roll, or you can give the item to whoever ninja loots it first, or you can try to figure out who has the greatest overall need, or you can give the item to whoever has the highest GEMS score.  It's up to the group.  Personally, I choose to follow NBG because I prefer to play in a cooperative environment, but I'm not going to pretend that it's fair. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvakra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vakra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/30/01 3:14:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> I would like to throw something else in the mix.<br>

Why does a person chance losing out on something they need just because Verant decided to screw over Iksar Shammies as an example?  Wouldn't that best be discussed with Verant?<br>

So Verant raised the drop rate of spells in OS to help the casters and now they complain that these spells aren't worth enough to be sufficient for them to bow out on mellee items.  Sounds like a double-edged sword.  Vernat does something to help lack of caster loot in OS and as a result people are more greedy.  And you wonder why Verant is so against screwing with the EQ economy.  So if Verant increases the drop rate on a mellee item then the issue will be solved?  Because then the 40k item will be worth 4k and nobody will give a shit about it.<br>
<br>
I think we need to tell Verant screw the economy and remove the pride of earning something nice.  Increase the drop rate on uber loot so nobody pharms it and people follow true NBG because wasting a weekend in EC trying to sell a Heiro cloak for 1k when you can go loot it in 5 mins is obsolete.  Now if only Verant would agree :P<br>
<br>
As far as the cloak, I didn't realize there were so few good mellee cloaks, although HBC is not that much worse than Heiro for mellee.<br>

<br>
No, Vakra, you've got it wrong.  Spells drop off of any Kunark mob in the appropriate level range, not just in OS.  The problem is, and has always been, that there are few Kunark mobs that drop the 56+ spells.  Occasionally you will hear of someone getting one off a mob in Skyfire, but most of them come from the mobs in the bowels of OS.  Verant has done nothing to help casters with these spells.<br>
<br>
Even before Verant increased the drop rate for the 51-55 spells, they weren't worth a lot.  They are fairly common drops in OS, Chardok, HS, Skyfire, Trak, and probably some other places.  You might have gotten 1k for a particular spell, but 100 pp would be closer to the average price if you could find a buyer.  A lot of people got all of their 51-55 spells from friends and guildmates before they even set foot in OS.  Now a lot of people just destroy them because they take up so much inventory space.<br>
<br>
So why did Verant increase the drop rate?  Because Verant wanted people to start hunting in Velious.  Kunark era spells do not drop in Velious, just as Velious era spells do not drop in Kunark.  By making the spells as common as rusty weapons in Gfay, Verant insured that casters would not have to spend much time in OS or Chardok or HS or Skyfire or Trak to get their spells. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueugien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eugien</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 429<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/30/01 5:23:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> Sage - then why dont I have all my 50+ spells?<br>
