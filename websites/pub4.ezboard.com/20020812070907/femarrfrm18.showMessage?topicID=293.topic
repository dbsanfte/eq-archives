Now add in the (basically unreported in the U.S.) fact that we had an operative meet with Osama while he was in a Turkish or Greek (can't remeber believe it was one of those two) hospital months prior to Sept. 11 but while he was still on our most wanted list. Mix in Afghanistan's balking at the U.S.'s attempts to build a gasline to the sea through their country, which members of the Carlyle Group would stand to profit from greatly. Add in Colin Powell's check-in-hand visit to Afgahnistan early in the Bush administration, to reward them for their &quot;utter destruction&quot; of opium, and sieve it through administration's post sept. 11 comments about Taliban gaining their money from the opium trade.

Johnston, in a statement to be released during a press conference in Oklahoma City on Friday – seven years to the day after the OKC bombing. <br>&quot;Everyone knows what happened in Oklahoma City at the Alfred P. Murrah Building on April 19, 1995,&quot; Johnston said. &quot;However, only a handful of people know that on that very day someone other than Tim McVeigh or Terry Nichols 'confessed' to being involved in the terrorist bombing plot that killed 168 people … .&quot; <br>Johnston said Abdul Hakim Murrad, who was in federal custody in New York City awaiting trial for plotting to blow up airliners, told jailers – &quot;and later the FBI&quot; – that the OKC bombing &quot;had been orchestrated by his former roommate in the Philippines, Ramzi Youssef,&quot; the &quot;most wanted terrorist in the world until his capture in Pakistan in February 1995.&quot; <br>He went on to say that Youssef was the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, and that the evidence pointed to connections between him, Murrad and Nichols in the Philippines. Nichols' phone records show that he made 13 &quot;unidentified calls&quot; from his home in Kansas to the Philippines in early April 1995, Johnston said. <br>Johnston also said his evidence &quot;will show that the Republic of Iraq and [President] Saddam Hussein were involved in funding and planning&quot; the OKC bombing. <br>Evidence suggests that Youssef and Murrad are Iraqi agents, Charles Key, a former Oklahoma legislator and currently a primary member of the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.okcbombing.org/">www.okcbombing.org/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> , told WorldNetDaily yesterday. <br>The Oklahoma attorney, in his statement, claims that &quot;certain elements of the United States government must have known&quot; about the &quot;foreign involvement all along,&quot; though he did not elaborate. <br>&quot;Indeed, in a recent Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking to obtain relevant information concerning&quot; the alleged involvement of other unidentified bombers, &quot;federal Judge Wayne Alley observed in written orders that, '… The FBI had maintained a shroud of secrecy around the entire bombing case since 1995,'&quot; said the statement. <br>Johnston said the evidence supports his claim that the FBI was &quot;ignoring substantial evidence of a major international terrorist offensive, conceived and planned in the Philippines sometime between 1991 and 1994,&quot; which &quot;produced tragic consequences of its own.&quot; <br>He said by ignoring Youssef's plan, codenamed &quot;Project Bojinka&quot; or &quot;Big Boom,&quot; the FBI &quot;created a situation that resulted in less than complete justice for the victims of the OKC bombing.&quot; <br>&quot;Specifically, other major terrorist acts were revealed on Ramsey Youssef's laptop computer, which was seized by Philippine authorities in January 1995, as [Murrad] was arrested,&quot; Johnston said. &quot;The most devastating of these new terrorist actions manifested itself on Sept. 11, 2001 … at a cost of almost 4,000 American civilian dead.&quot; <br>Johnston said the news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Central time at the &quot;Christ Averting His Eyes&quot; memorial, just west of the bombing memorial in Oklahoma City. The conference will begin 30 minutes after a memorial service for those killed in the attack. <br>Johnston's announcement follows other legal action attempting to connect Iraq to the bombing. <br>In March, a class action lawsuit &lt;/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=26833&gt; was filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., by public interest law firm Judicial Watch <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org">www.judicialwatch.org</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> against Iraq for that state's alleged involvement in the OKC bombing. <br>&quot;Plaintiffs assert that the entire plot was, in whole or in part, orchestrated, assisted technically and/or financially, and directly aided by agents of the Republic of Iraq,&quot; the suit said. <br>Federal officials have repeatedly said the attack on the Murrah Building was committed by former Army vet McVeigh – who was executed June 11, 2001 – and accomplice Nichols, now serving a life sentence for his role in the bombing. <br>The FBI says the explosion, which destroyed nearly one-third of the building, was the result of a huge ammonium nitrate-laden truck bomb parked in front of the building. <br>&quot;We knew as early as 1995 that Iraq was likely involved in the bombing,&quot; Keys said. <br>He said he and other committee members knew based on research done by Brad Edwards and Jayna Davis &lt;/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22122&gt;, who worked at the time for an NBC television affiliate in Oklahoma City. <br>Davis, in March 2001, was the first reporter to publicly announce an alleged connection between al-Qaida terrorist leader Osama bin Laden – wanted in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks – and the OKC bombing. <br>Related stories: <br><br>Click here for WND's extensive coverage of the OKC bombing. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wnd.com/okc.asp">www.wnd.com/okc.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br><br>Related Special Offers: <br>&quot;Final Report&quot;

while others wonder if it isn't just the ravings of a lunatic. <br><br>The man telling the tale in sworn court affidavits is Delmart Edward Vreeland, who faces credit fraud charges in Canada and in the United States, where officials are attempting to extradite him. <br><br>The 35-year-old American claims to be a lieutenant in a U.S. Navy intelligence unit - a spy who says he knew in advance about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. <br><br>In his affidavit, he says he tried to warn Canadian intelligence about possible terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon, along with targets in Ottawa and Toronto, but was written off as a petty criminal. <br><br>So he wrote the warning on a piece of paper, sealed it in an envelope, and handed it to jail guards a month before the attacks. They opened the letter Sept. 14 and immediately forwarded the information to Ottawa. <br><br>His lawyers, Rocco Galati and Paul Slansky, are fighting extradition, telling the court he could face treason charges and the death penalty in the U.S. <br><br>In the first stage of hearings, federal prosecutor Kevin Wilson yesterday told Mr. Justice Archie Campbell of the Superior Court of Justice that he was skeptical of Vreeland's claims. <br><br>&quot;Is his story possible? I can't go so far as to say it's not possible, but it's not plausible,&quot; Wilson said. <br><br>The prosecutor said he has seen no evidence to back Vreeland's claim that Canadian embassy official Marc Bastien was murdered in Moscow in December. Canadian officials said the 35-year-old computer specialist died of natural causes. <br><br>So, who is Delmart Edward Joseph Michael Vreeland II? <br><br>According to court documents, Vreeland was 18 when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1984. <br><br>Two years later, Vreeland says in his affidavit, he joined a special unit investigating drug smuggling into the U.S. by naval personnel. But the navy says Vreeland was &quot;unsatisfactorily discharged&quot; in 1986. <br><br>Vreeland also claims he gathered information on a crime family in Detroit and testified against them in 1998. <br><br>Late last year, he says, he came to Canada to help smuggle Russian military secrets out of Moscow, including Russia's plan to counter the American 'Star Wars' missile defence system. While in Moscow, Vreeland says, he met Bastien. <br><br>Vreeland was arrested by a police fugitive squad nine months ago. While in Toronto (Don) Jail, he met Nestor Fonseca, who was facing drug smuggling charges and extradition to the U.S. The court documents say Fonseca allegedly told Vreeland of his plans to kill a Toronto judge and others. Fonseca was charged with counselling to commit murder. <br><br>Galati and Slansky said in the documents that Vreeland should be put into the witness protection program in Canada because he is the main witness against Fonseca. <br><br>Galati writes in one document: &quot;Neither myself, nor Mr. Slansky ... have seen anything as incomprehensibly frustrating, inexplicable and irresponsibly absurd. as the RCMP's position that they are not interested in reviewing Mr. Vreeland's information.&quot; <br><br>It would appear, Galati says in the brief, that the Canadian and American governments have written Vreeland off as a &quot;nut case,&quot; which he says is a &quot;patently absurd conclusion.&quot; <br><br><br>With files from Donovan Vincent <br><br>Rheaton Stormcast<br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>55</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f The U</font><font color=#008800>ni</font><font color=#007700>ted</font><font color=#006600> Fe</font><font color=#005500>derat</font><font color=#004400>io</font><font color=#003300>n</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/19/02 10:24:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=293.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Disturbing</span><hr size=1>   If 75% of the events closely relate to what it claims, it is disturbing to me that either ; 1. our government would exploit its own people for economic gain OR 2. that our government is so ignorant of current events that it could not properly draw correlations that might have prevented the successful terrorist attacks of 9/11.

Could be some BS, but according to the link you provided, it might be possible.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/19/02 11:09:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=293.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Disturbing</span><hr size=1> I am an architectural designer. I am not entirely responsible for the structure that holds up a building (that's the structural engineer's job), but if the design gets complicated it can be a structural engineer's nightmare.. (I prefer to call it a challenge hehh)<br><br>As part of the process, there is much correspondence that takes place between the disciplines. Many comments and suggestions that are given back to me from my engineers. If I fail to take into consideration these comments, I could very well make a costly mistake... Very costly.<br><br>Same thing for the struct. engin...  If he makes a bad calculation and under-sizes a structural support member, he too can make an extremely costly mistake... talking live and death here. What does this have to do with 9-11?  Well.. If my boss were to tell me &quot;Hey!!  you fooked up bad and its is going to cost the company millions of dollars!!!&quot;... I do not think a simple &quot;Well Sir, ya see.. my office is really unorganized. I haven't been able to find the notes the engineers gave me. I'll clean up my office a in hopes it doesn't happen again..&quot;<br><br>Think my boss will be ok with that?  No..  my head would roll, loose my job, and no telling what else... Have a black mark on my resume that would last me the rest of my days.<br><br>...yet.. somehow the FBI, CIA and all the others seem to have got away with it. Not only that, they got upgrades!  New computers, more money!
