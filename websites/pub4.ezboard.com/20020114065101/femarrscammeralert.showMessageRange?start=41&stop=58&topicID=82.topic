  No, Yilynwen was not in your guild when he pulled this... Followers of Norrath I believe was the guild he was in when he did it.<br>
<br>
  Please note that Storm's Fury does not hold Followers of Norrath responsible for this sock-jockeys actions.<br>
<br>
  Stupid really, delibrately going out of your way to piss off one of the more powerful guilds on the server... the loss to us was pretty insignificant: we replaced what West had lost pretty quickly.  Loss to Yilnywen?  Well, he sure as hell won't be getting into any guild that we have contacts in anytime soon, and if he's stupid enough to show his head when one of our guildmembers is in the same zone we'll make sure that everyone in the zone knows not to trust this puss-sucking waste of blood.<br>

My 12 enchie twink and 5 ppl new to EQ were camping Derv 2 when this &quot;lovely&quot; person showed up and started killing every Derv in sight. Hardly a tactic covered by the rules of camp sharing. We petitioned on him and received immediate responses from GMs who seemed very eager to punish Yilnywen. This was the middle of the night when petitions usually take at least an hour for a response. He must have one ugly SoulMark....so fire off those petitions and maybe we can make Norrath better by eliminating one asshole at least. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uleldariluthiniel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leldari Luthiniel</A> at: 4/17/01 5:20:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usyrsuro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syrsuro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/18/01 12:51:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Beware of Yilnywen, AKA fucking scumbag</span><hr size=1> Just for the record...Following this incident, he was removed from the Followers of Norrath also.<br>

<br>
Yes this is a game, and people who get worked up because their class isn't powerful enough, or because they were killed by a creeature that wasn't powerful, or other nonsense, they are being ridiculous. However, on the other side of those pixels is another human being. When ever a human being takes the time and effort to intentionally cheat or try to harm another human, no matter the setting, no matter how small, it does and should offend.<br>

   I have played Eq for about 2 years. I actually enjoy the friends I make and the game to much to let a Jerkoff like you ruin it. I do believe you are the Yilnywen. There is no other explanation on how you would have known the name of the player that was Scammed. I guess what I don't understand is why Verant puts up with Assholes like you. If I were a GM id follow your sorry ass every step you made, and just waited for you  to screw up. Your sorry ass would be banned so fast your head wouldn't have time to swim. hey that's a thought=)<br>
Another comment you made about,how EQ players are the losers who play 5 hours and take a 30 min break... its 15 minutes..if you cant keep up... take notes..<br>
The sad thing is your a pathetic Loaner who prob hasn't had a person you can call a friend ... no your parents don't count....in ages. You know  if you would spend half as much time working on your people skills instead of dreaming up ways to scam people, then you would prob be like the rest of us who have a lot of friends who play EQ. When is the last time you logged into Eq and got tells from several people( ok let me restate that) whens the last time you logged into Eq and got tells from sever people with out the words...Fuck you you scamming low life.. I hope you rot in hell.. coming into play. The point I'm trying to make is, If your going to run your head about how pathetic we are for playing EQ then you really need to rethink your position.. You play EQ and scam people.. guess your one up on the rest of us. So please stop spamming us with your nonsense.<br>
