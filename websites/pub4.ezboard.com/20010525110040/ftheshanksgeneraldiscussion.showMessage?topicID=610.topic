Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent...and the guilty.  The Lawbringer would like to thank all parties involved for being good sports.  I would also like to thank Wazu of TZ for his inspiration and that classic line "I thought you were an orc".  Also, please forgive the Lawbringers court reporting skills, I am merely an officer of the law, not a scribe or poet.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Chapter One - Night Watch</b><br>
Rammadge the Lawbringer stood atop the city walls of Freeport keeping a silent vigil over the city he has sworn to protect.  The warm night air blew softly in his face making him long for the arctic winds of his homeland.  The nights in Freeport would play out the same way day by day, once darkness had settled over the lands, the darklings would raid the grounds outside the city in hopes of catching the young citizens to far from the protection of the city guards.  When the raids would start, Rammadge would be there, along with a scant few other guardians in the hopes of saving the citizens and repelling the forces of darkness.  This night was like the others.  A slight tingle emenated from the initiate symbol of the Tribunal Rammadge wore around his neck, and an vision was granted to him from his liege, the Tribunal.  The vision showed a couple trolls running into the lands and attacking a lone human monk killing skeletons.  <b>JUSTICE</b>  With a cry of alarm Rammadge lept from the walls and ran for the area he saw in his vision.  True to his vision, there stood two trolls attacking the unsuspecting monk mercilessly.  Rammadge casted his blinding mojo on one of the trolls, then with the aid of his trusty gavel Lawgiver I he lept into combat on the other startled troll.  Within minutes other humans heard the call and joined in the fray and a small crowd had formed a deadly circle around the invaders.  Moments later, the two trolls were dead and the monk was being bandaged and many cheers were heard throughout the crowd.<b>JUSTICE SERVED</b>  Scanning the happy faces in the assembled crowd Rammadge saw the little one and warned the others <i>"Lookout friends, a GOBLIN!".</i>  All stood in confusion and looked around at each other clearly befuddled, but that was the opening Rammadge needed and within seconds spells were cast at the goblin raider and the chase was on.  The confused goblin shouted <i>"I am no goblin you big dumb barbarian dolt, stop attacking me!"</i>  After a few circles around the yard, a friendly Combine ranger rooted the goblin in place and Rammadge stood face to face with the foul creature.  <i> "I am Rammadge the Lawbringer, and since you aided in the defense of Freeport I am willing to hear your story goblin and any defense you may have, let us retire to the courtyard inside the walls of Freeport where you will be tried for the crimes you have committed."</i><br>
<br>
<b>Chapter Two - Tobu the Goblinchild VS. the City of Freeport</b><br>
Rammadge climbed the stairs and stood above the assembled citizens of Freeport and the accused goblin.  <I>"I am Rammadge the Lawbringer, honorable Shank Judge, Hammer of the Tribunal and Shaman of Justice.  I come before you tonight Freeport to hear the defense of one Tobu the Goblin who stands accused of crimes against this fair city.  Tobu, according to city code 136 section 5 article 13, you are being charged with poaching in human lands, city code 112 section 19 article 3 trespassing in human lands, and finally city code 15 section 29 article 5, being a goblin in human lands, how do you plea?" </i>  The enraged Tobu shouted <i>"Not guilty, and I denounce this farce and...",</i>  Tobu was cut off by the yells of the crowd.  Rammadge tried to restore order and shouted to the assembled citizens <i>"Let it be known that the goblin has entered the plea of not guilty, and please strike from the records the rant the goblin began.  Tobu the goblin, this is how this case will be tried, I will ask you a series of questions and you will answer them honestly and I will make my descision based on your responses.  Here is your first question..."</i><br>
<br>
<b>Chapter Three - Extreme Prosecution</b><br>
Rammadge began <i>"It is written in the lore of my ancestors that goblins are short, fat and green little foul creatures who plunder the land.  Are you Tobu the Goblin not short?"  "Well...ahem...yes"  "Are you Tobu the Goblin not fat?"  "Well...its not all fat..."  "Are you Tobu the Goblin not green?"  "I am not green you big oaf!"  "Is not your shirt green little one?  Maybe so, but two out of three is not bad."</i>  The crowd erupts in laughter and begins to heckle the goblin.  Rammadge motions for the crowd to be silent and continues his case.  <i>"Tobu the goblin, from what city do you hail?"  "I proudly hail from Rivervale dolt, and you know it."  "Aha Tobu, I have caught you now.  Citizens of Freeport, as I traveled to your fair city from my home in Halas I stopped in many nice human outposts along the way, Qeynos, Highhold and Rivervale.  When I stopped in the human city of Rivervale I found the town overrun with Tobu and his kind, and no humans were to be found.  Outraged I began killing as many of the goblins as I could until the goblin guards jumped in the fray against me.  Many goblins died that day, but we must return and find what the goblins have done with the human citizens of Rivervale and punish them for sacking the city.!"</i>  The assembled crowd roared in approval and the chant DOWN with HALFLINGS began.  Rammadge beat his gavel upon the stone wall and pleaded for silence.  <i>"One more test Tobu the goblin, repeat to me in your native tounge this phrase:  Do not kill me, I am a halfling not a goblin."  "Very well oaf, Do not kill me, I am indeed a halfling, not a goblin"  "AHA, I have caught you once more goblin.  That is the same language spoken by the goblins of Rivervale as I was slaying them!"</i><br>
<br>
<b>Chapter Four - No Pardon for the Wicked</b><br>
<I>"Tobu the Goblin, I have heard enough.  In the charge of poaching on human lands, I find you guilty.  The sentence is for a 100 platinum fine and 50 lashes.  For your crime of trespassing on human lands I find you guilty, the sentence is instant banishment.  And in the charge of being a goblin I find you guilty, and the sentence is..."</i>  The assembled crowd began the chant <b>DEATH DEATH DEATH.</b>  Rammadge smiled to the crowd and continued <i>"Indeed citizens, DEATH."</i>  Tobu managed to stammer a few protests and made a few hasty steps towards the gates but was quickly subdued by the angry throng of human citizens.  A cold, ear piercing squeel pierced the night and justice was served.  Rammadge the Lawbringer stood above the crowd and proclamed <i>"Case Closed, Justice has been done today, are there any who would voice any protest?"</i>  From the back of the crowd an elf, another halfling and a human shouted their scathing curses.  Rammadge shouted <I>"Another goblin and a couple goblin sympathizers, kill them as well!"</i>  And the chase was on...<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion - Justice for All</b><br>
Rammadge the Lawbringer stood atop the walls of Freeport, a warm desert wind blew through his golden hair.  A sly and dark grin creased the normally grim and stern visage of the barbarian shaman.  <B>Court Adjourned.</b></font><P><B><font size=4 face="tempus sans itc"
