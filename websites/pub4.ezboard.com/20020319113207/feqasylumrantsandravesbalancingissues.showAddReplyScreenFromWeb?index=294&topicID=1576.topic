It is also one that could not take place in this forum without either a) me ending up getting flamed by someone for &quot;flaunting my sexuality&quot; b) revealing more about my life on a public board than I am prepared to divulge or c) having more than one person intruding into the dialogue in an unproductive manner.  Given what seems to be your extreme predisposition against Christianity I'm not sure that it would be time well spent on either of our parts.<br>
<br>
I will say that the Christianity I was raised in believes that when Christ died for the sins of the world, a new Covenant was created which replaced the old Covenant (ie the Old Testament).  Many of your &quot;you can't be a real Christian&quot; examples seem to spring from the laws of the old Covenant. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

You are incorrect. I do not have a predisposition against Christianity. It's against the so-called Christians who make your faith look bad. <p><center>

The New Covenant is *the* central tenet of Christianity.  Through the sacrifice of His son for the sins of the world, all who believe shall be saved.  That single act replaces the covenant that God made in the Old Testament with the children of Abraham.<br>
<br>
Now bear in mind I am also out of alignment with a majority of Christians in that my faith is most similiar to Quakers and Unitarian-Universalists, both groups which are comparatively small and who tend to shy away from literal interpretation.  In many ways, I would probably find greater commonality with a Buddhist than a Southern Baptist in many of my viewpoints.  So I am definitely the wrong person to be questioning on &quot;chapter and verse&quot; sorts of issues.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

And why? Because he says so! Because for some reason, its important to Tyral that all Christians follow the Old Covenant rules!  Why?  Because HE would like it better that way!  Otherwise, you're not a REAL Christian -- says the man who follows Asatru, and has zero respect for Christians!<br>
<br>
I guess all the Christians here made up the New Covenant/Old Covenant concept right here, today in this thread because you made 'em all really defensive and skeered, Tyral!  You must really have shaken up their beliefs with that stunningly intellectual rebuttal of &quot;oh you made that bullshit up!&quot;  I'm just sad you left out the &quot;neener neener neener!&quot; at the end of that little sneer. Seems... lacking somehow without it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So anyway... let me be the first to ask this of YOU Tyral -- just as I asked Sijandi earlier... why do you give a shit if you hate Christians so much, and you dont even follow Christianity?  Ok, because you're involved in the discussion in the thread.. But really - what happened, did a Christian kid beat you in the relay race in second grade?  Someone offer you a bible once?  Oh wait.. I know... maybe one of them once laughed at your religion, calling it a &quot;fictional mythology&quot;!  THAT's it... that must mean... you dont like people to disrespect your religion!<br>
<br>
Oh my goodness.. could it be that maybe Christians feel the same way?<br>

I am quite aware of what it entails to be a Christian. And in the 18 years I called myself such, I dont' ever recall hearing about the Old Testament no longer being relevant. I don't recall hearing that God stated that the old rules were out the window. And I certainly don't remember reading anything that said it was okay to do all the things I've mentioned in previous posts.<br>
<br>
I've stated it before, I do not hate Christians, nor do I hate Christianity. It is just not for me. It's apparently not for a LOT of people, but they are so lost in the bible-thumping and the fear of Hell that they are too afraid to open their eyes to see if there's something else out there.<br>
<br>
Another thing: while it is the modern Christian's belief that you should &quot;turn the other cheek,&quot; and move on should someone insult you or try to harm you, it is not mine. Should a man insult my religion to my face, he should be prepared to defend himself. <p><center>

I don't hate Christians. I don't hate very many people at all, and those I have very personal reasons to hate, believe me.<br>
<br>
To your earlier comment, I studied in depth, trying to condense all the study, especially that of the last 8 yrs I worshipped, in this forum is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
You stated several people proved me wrong, but I fail to see any proof. All I see are other people expressing their opinion, which is that I'm a jerk, among other things. <br>
<br>
Throughout this thread, I have not attempted to tell religious people their _faith_ doesn't exist. Simply that it may be placed inappropriately, especially in light of _history_.  <br>
<br>
When some people believe they can determine what name to call their beliefs, regardless of the accepted tenets and dogma of that belief, it's pointless to attempt a civil discourse with them.<br>
<br>
Zistin, the direct comparison is valid, regardless of how much it stings.<br>
<br>
You call yourself a Christian, even though you feel no obligation to follow all the teachings of Christ.<br>
<br>
They called themselves Muslims, even though they were definitely not following the teachings of Allah.<br>
<br>
Your statements, to me, were no different than someone saying, &quot; I am a Muslim, but I eat pork, drink alcohol and I never bother praying. But I'm still a Muslim 'cause I say I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
Christ taught many things which modern &quot;Christians&quot; don't accept of follow. Who do you think is in the wrong here? Christ, who taught the proper way to strive to live your life, or the people who choose to disregard his teachings?<br>
<br>
Lanaya has added a lot of content to this discussion. I think the &quot;apostle&quot; that was briefly mentioned might have been a reference to the Gospel of Thomas. This book was dropped from the early bible at the first council of Nicea (I believe, but am not positive it was the first council).<br>
<br>
As for whether Paul was an apostle, well if mere association with the disciples of Christ conveys this apellation than there were a lot of Apostles weren't there?<br>
<br>
Paul was always a pet subject of mine because of his false claims to a family heritage of Pharisees. Despite the misleading text in some places, the Sadduccees were the group of Hebrews in charge of running the temple and treating with the Roman occupiers at the time of Christ. When defending himself in one of his many letters, Paul states that he was a Pharisee and had come from a long line of Pharisees. Yet at the time of his conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul was working for the Sadduccees, chasing down the &quot;heretical&quot; Christians. Paul brought his own beliefs firmly center stage. His letters to the various churches spread throught the Medittereanean world comprise most of the scripture which all the different variations and denominations draw their differences. Yet, the word should be consistent throughout.<br>
<br>
You may have the strongest faith in your spiritual beliefs possible, but that doesn't mean those beliefs are true. You may identify with an organized religion and refer to yourself as a member of that religion. Doesn't make it true. <br>
<br>
No, Christians are not perfect, nor are they expected to be. Christ said he came to minister to the sick, not the well. This was while he was criticized for eating with the whores and taxpayers, the unsavory, unaccepted part of society. Yet, how many of these people do you see the average &quot;Christian&quot; ministering to? <br>
<br>
Yes, humans have the same flaws regardless of their station in life or spiritual beliefs. Corruption is part of being human. All the statements that were made simply reaffirm the basic point that has been made. Since people are that way, since there will always be some abuse by those in power of any organization, what reason to accept any organizations explanation for something which no one can prove?<br>
<br>
There's a reason it's referred to as &quot;practicing&quot; one's religion. It takes a conscious, ongoing effort to observe the teachings of your professed belief system and struggling to understand in greater depth the lessons given therein.<br>
<br>
&quot;Faith without works is dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Flame away.<br>

<br>
Esto: same old yellow journalism and making unwarrented logical leaps, I remember you now from the sleepers threads!  You have managed to assume I am a literal creationist, tho I have said numerous times that I am not. <br>
<br>
 You have attempted to define sticking up for unpopular beliefs as foolish, and teaching unpopular beleifs as evil.  By your definition of evil (Jesus is evil for telling people to spread his word as it would lead to strife) Most of the scientists of the middle ages were evil, Galileo was right to recant, ect ad inifinitum.  Im sorry telling people what they dont want to hear, even what they might react violently to, is not evil.  If it was I could probably safely call you evil^^  <br>
<br>
Finally you have managed to decide that I made some statement about my opinions on the bible, when as a person who beleives in a higher power in the most broad possible terms (again this is posted twice already tho since no one reads my posts I guess I can forgive this) my opinions on the bible's interpretation are really not that relevant.  I have never even read the entire bible.  I merely saw your quote, highly suspected that it was out of context (I tend to suspect highly biased sources quoting 2 lines out of a 1000 page work, call me nuts), I proceeded to in 30 seconds find the relevant chapter through a simple search, and determine with some basic reading skills that your representation of it was entirely unfair.  If you used a similar quoting policy in journalism, you would quickly find yourself fired or working for the enquirer :P  Ever since then your posts have been some incredible double talk attempting to equate what is unpopular with what is wrong, a position that Im confident has few supporters who do not have a vested interest in trying to save thier shitty arguments :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulanayalanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanaya Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 8:59:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=304>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> If this last paragraph is true, then what would you do if someone called a tenet of your religion bullshit, and said the majority of your religion's followers were... I dunno, deluded, or not worthy of calling themseves followers of Asatru (is there a word &quot;Asatrian&quot;? I'm not sure how members of your faith refer to themselves).  ?  Would you say that such a person had better be prepared to defend themselves?<br>
<br>
As for Old Covenant and New Covenant, I heard these referred to constantly through my religious education as a child, as well as found it an often-touched upon topic in my later studies as an adult.  Obviously others here have as well.  I'm sure there are some denominations in the 20,000+ protestant denominations out there that dont hold this view, but I'd guess they were a small minority, and I figured this was something just about all christians were familiar with.<br>
<br>
Just because you didn't hear of it doesn't make it bullshit, and it doesn't mean the Christians here just pulled it out of their ass to fool you with or something.  Perhaps it means you should have educated yourself about the Christian religion you grew up in a bit better.<br>
<br>
If you're really interested -- you might read the scriptures that concern the immediate time after Christ's death, the first acts of the apostles, the discussions they had with Paul on these matters after his conversion.  There were debates among even these very first Christians, and eventually it was agreed that the Good News, the promise of the Resurrection, the New Covenant replaced the old.  Remember Christ's references to losing sight of God because of the law... at one point, I dont have the actual chapter/verse handy, but he says the Sabbath is made for man, not man for the sabbath... He'd asked the apostles to do something, and they were shocked, as it was considered not keeping the sabbath holy; but Christ was emphasizing that holiness isn't in keeping all the minute rules that the pharisees loved.  So the thousand and one little laws that were set out in the Old Testament, Christ pretty much got rid of them.  Dont need em anymore.  The cross and resurrection are the end, the last deal.<br>
<br>
Just reread your post - to address something else you brought up, I dont think anyone here, or any reasonable Christian, would say its okay to sleep around (whether gay or straight), that its okay to commit adultery (whether gay or straight), that its ok and good to abuse drugs or alcohol, to cheat, or anything like that.  Will people who call themselves Christians do these things? Of course - they're human beings, and as such are sinners.  Just because they sin, it doesn't mean they aren't Christians.  Christians are supposed to try to follow Christ's example; when they fail to do so, they confess in their own way, they ask forgiveness, they try again.  We're all human beings, no matter what our religion, or lack thereof; therefore we're all going to be less than perfect, we'll always all have our flaws... Are we going to constantly be running around pointing fingers at people saying you're not fit to be called a Christian/American/member of the PTA/etc etc etc...<br>
<br>
Basically, none of us are perfect, including you - so why do you get to judge who is a Christian and who isn't?  If you are so interested in judging whether people are fit to call themselves members of a certain religion, then tell me, do you do the same towards those that follow your religion?  And how do they feel about this role you've set for yourself? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulanayalanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanaya Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 9:02:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=305>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> doh some other people posted ahead of me.. my post above was directed towards Tyral. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urivlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rivlas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 9:06:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=306>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> Also let's get one thing straight...<br>
<br>
The old covenant refers to the sacrificial system of taking a flawless lamb and sacrificing it for your sin.<br>
<br>
The new coventant does away with that since when Jesus died on the cross the ultimate sacrifice had been made and temporary replacements were no longer necessary.<br>
<br>
The sacrificing of lambs was to point forward to The Lamb of God.  In no one of itself did sacrificing a lamb relieve you of your sins; it was the symbolizm and the acceptance in the future deilverance of the savior that did that.<br>
<br>
The Ten Commandments are the basis on which God's law is founded.  Commandments 1-4 describe Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, all thy soul and all thy strength.  Commandments 5-10 describe Love thy neighbor as thyself.  The two are intertwined.  If you were to say the old law is done away with it's like saying God is OK with murder and adultry.<br>
<br>
It's clearly state that God does not change, so why would his law?  Especially when it's the only law he ever wrote with His hand on stones.  If they weren't important and were gonna be done away with then Moses would have just written them down on paper with the rest of Exodus without the stones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyralthekithless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyral the Kithless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 9:23:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=307>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://secondrising.8m.com/images/smilies/iamwithstupid.gif height=46 width=41></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If this last paragraph is true, then what would you do if someone called a tenet of your religion bullshit, and said the majority of your religion's followers were...

If you could actually discuss my religion with any accuracy at all, then it would be possible for you to insult it in that way. Since you have no knowledge of even the basic beliefs of my faith, you could not. If you could, then we would have a discussion, because it would be more than just base ignorance. However, if you insulted with your only intention being to get a rise out of me, you will have succeeded. And you will receive the ass-kicking you asked for.<br>

The Christian faith preaches that it is not good works that will get you into Heaven, but instead being &quot;born again&quot; in Christ and accepting him as your saviour. Asking him forgiveness for your sins.<br>
<br>
My faith doesn't teach that. We don't believe that being forgiven is enough. You must work to erase the deed. Your life is measured through the good you have done.<br>

You cannot compare the two religions. They are incredibly different. There are very, very few common threads between the two...and those are even of a different color.<br>

You might believe differently about what the old/new convenants means in their entirety, and all the details of what it includes.  However, in spite of these differences, I am not prepared to say that either you, or say Jay m who sees the issue differently, and any less of a Christian, or somehow not qualified to be Christians, as Tyral seems to want to do.  I'm not going to sit here and tell you you're not a Christian, even though I think that your particular viewpoint on old vs new covenant is .. ahem... wrong. :P  But that's anoooottthhheerrr debate I'm too tired to go into right now -- but its an interesting topic if you want to throw it at me so I can tell you why exactly you're wrong some other time :P<br>
<br>
Just to throw a little debate question out tho, if Christians have to keep all of the old testament laws despite the new covenant, does that mean you disagree with what St. Paul said in scripture?  And really, I think you should tell us, were you ritually circumcised and do you keep kosher? &gt;:P<br>

First of all, where did I insult your religion?  I was sarcastic in my post, but first of all, NO more so than you have been.  You seem to have decided that you are the arbiter of what makes a person a Christian or not.  I think that's a pretty arrogant perch you've set yourself up on there, and I think a lot of people would like to see you fall from it.  You dont have the right to tell anyone else whether they're a good Christian, a good Asatruar, your responsiblity is to yourself, and make sure you are a good Asatruar.  It isn't your responsibilty to point out others flaws and shortcomings, any more than it is mine.  Your quote from me was not me insulting your religion, it was me turning your words about Christians back on yourself,  and asking if you'd kick the ass of someone who made the same insults about and to people of your religion.<br>
Apparently you wouldn't like it.  Maybe Christians dont like it when you insult them.  Gee, there's a concept.<br>
<br>
That said, I make it a point not to insult other people's religions.  I do however make it a point to insult people's politics, Democrats and Republicans especially.  Again, that's another rant. :P<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually there are also Christian faiths, most notably the Catholic church, that believe that salvation is gained through both faith AND works.  There must be belief in the Lord, belief that he is the savior, but there also must be evidence of that belief in how you live your life.  I think pretty much a majority of protestant denominations take the Sola Fides (&quot;faith alone&quot;) interpretation -- it was one of Luther's and Protestantism's greatest disagreements with Catholics.<br>
<br>
Even after I stopped practicing Catholicism, and became more and more agnostic, I still pretty much look at scripture and Christianity from a Catholic viewpoint... and to this day I've always thought that the 'utter a salvation prayer and you're saved, all your sins are magically erased!' was an incorrect interpretation, and an incredible denial of many parts of scripture and Tradition.  However, neither then, nor now, do I think this disagreement makes Protestants any less Christian than Catholics.  I think there is a genuine, honest disagreement there in interpretation that will probably never be reconciled.  <br>
<br>
So again, you are attempting to generalize all christians as the same here.  You use the term &quot;Christians&quot; and &quot;Christianity&quot; as if it is the same throughout; here's proof that its not, you've generalized here about an EXTREMELY important issue among Christians (the sola fides issue) and made a completely inaccurate and generalized statement about it.  Haven't you figured out, after this entire thread, that there are so many different types of Christianity that you just can't do that?<br>
<br>

Perhaps in your limited experience.  And that's unfortunate.  Its also my unfortunate experience that most Wiccans I have met are drug addicts (in personal experience, I'd put the number at about 13/15).  However, I'm not about to make a judgement on their religion based on my limited experience.  That would be silly; and pretty close minded of me, dont you think?<br>
<br>
And since you've set yourself up to be the official person who points out hypocritical christians, do the Christians get to have an official too?  Its only fair, after all.  <br>

And further, as I've stated throughout this thread, I'm an agnostic.  I'm not tied really to any kind of religious doctrine or teaching.  Culturally I'd say I'm Catholic, sure, but definitely not religiously.  So you can lose the smart ass tone of voice that you put on for the &quot;poor deluded Christians&quot;, and at least attempt to talk to another human being who has tried to carry on a somewhat civil conversation with you with at least a tiny bit of respect.

Your writing style and knowledge are refreshing.<br>
<br>
To whoever wanted to put me down for attending different denominations while still young, calling me a religion shopper or something to that effect:<br>
<br>
I should be ashamed for trying to educate myself? For learning, from the source, different denominational beliefs concerning how to live your life and what comprises a Christian life? I don't think so. Cast aspersions on my character all you like, when I have curiousity about a subject, I educate myself on the matter as much as possible. Then I make up my mind what I think or believe. I don't spend my time half-heartedly. Time is precious, I spend it doing what I enjoy.<br>
<br>
I don't deny anyone else their opinion, neither do I refrain from expressing mine. If that expression sometimes descends to sarcasm, que sera sera. U tend to address certain people in terms they can understand. If it upsets them, that's their problem and not mine. I can't see getting upset about a discussion centering on a subject that has indeed been beaten like a dead horse. Great minds have debated many of the aspects of this discussion throughout the past. As Lanaya stated, the discussion concerning adherence to the Old Testament laws began immediately after the death of Christ. Christ addressed it prior to his death. He basically informed the disciples that salvation was for all mankind, not just the Hebrews. If I remember correctly (all my books are packed still) this discussion was pretty much summed by Christ:<br>
<br>
&quot;...In my father's house are many mansions...&quot;<br>
<br>
If memory serves me, this was part of the culmination of the lesson where Christ basically told the disciples to worry about their own salvation and let everyone else worry about theirs. Not that you couldn't &quot;testify&quot; to others, or minister to others, but that it wasn't the place of the Christian to decide who the Holy Trinity would allow into Heaven; that is, who might be saved. This decision is reserved for the deity. With the exception of denying Christ, he states that no one is beyond salvation.<br>
<br>
This is the origin of the debate about faith and works. If you repent and accept Christ on your death bed, after a life of sin, are you saved? According to the teachings of Christ, yes. According to some denominations, no. <br>
<br>
What was it Christ said about straining at a gnat?<br>
