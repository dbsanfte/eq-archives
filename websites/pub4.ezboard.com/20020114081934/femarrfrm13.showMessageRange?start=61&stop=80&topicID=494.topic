It is in extremely poor taste that Adarian &amp; Flintik decided to make fools of themselves by whining on the boards.  Personally, this gives me pause before asking either on a raid as the last thing I ever want to deal with is someone whining.<br>
<br>
Adarian &amp; Flintik - As the famous phrase goes, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If you don't like they way the raids are run - RUN YOUR OWN</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Realize that not everything works the way <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> think it should.  Running pick-up raids is a very stressful position, especially when little things don't go exactly as planned. IE: You have more people than expected when your reinforcements are supposed to arrive. IMHO, Vec has done more than enough to explain the situation. Get over it. <p>Ever in service of Clan Battle Axe,<BR>

<br>
 I myself was a backup raider who just happened to show up at the beginning of the raid and filled in for the no shows.. <br>
<br>
 I stayed for about 15 hours, almost to the end of it. And truthfully, It surprised me he brought any up....<br>
<br>
 At the end of the first wave we had plenty of people to move on ahead, we just ran short a few clerics.. that right there changed whatever plans Vec had for a second wave... plenty of other classes to go ahead.. but we needed healers..bad. So I really wouldn't have blamed the guy if all he brought up was a select few..<br>
<br>
..but from what I saw being totally non partial,since this was my first encounter with Vec ingame at all, he brought up what we needed. And that's fine by me... can you imagine how quickly the second wave would've went to shit had he brought up a bunch of melee characters that just wanted to go? He did the right thing, brought up the amount of healers and buffers we needed and we moved ahead after a long wait.<br>
<br>
 I mean really people, you sent him tells at 2nd wave time and expected a long well thought response or something? We were still getting mobs while waiting on the healers and he was having a hell of a tough time trying to keep everyone in a position to not aggro and get killed, pull so our remaining clerics did not get so bored and leave after the first floor where all their drops are,and generally organizing a hate raid with 30+ people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I was amazed when I would send him a tell and even got a 'yes' or 'no' answer.. the guy was swamped and handled it all excellently.<br>
<br>
 Good raid ran by a good leader, if you missed it, try for the next one.. I know some of us work and can't make first waves when they exist, but you should really try. You have a better chance of getting in from the start when you sign up for a pick up raid... I damn sure wouldn't have it in me to go back for others who wanted in on a second wave or were just latecomers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uadariansilverthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adarian Silverthorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/8/01 7:21:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: **Updated**2 part HATE raid (Tue, 7 Aug - 7AM/4PM CST)</span><hr size=1> Yes I over reacted and did flame some people who didn't really deserve it.

So i start reading the first whine post,and in this state i am in now,i could not handle reading all of the post,why? because it hurt my head trying to understand the whine.I did not bother reading the second,i read first sentence and it hurt my head even more.<br>
<br>
So i will write up my own whine,WAAAA!!! one of the best pick up raid pullers led a beautiful raid,with a bunch of newbie's who act and think they are the greatest,we died once,then we got real bored and started pulling second floor to first floor,WAHHH!!!.<br>
<br>
<br>
WAHHH!!! it was such a good raid,no one wanted to leave,cept the clerics who were complaining about needing sleep,and THEN vecartibus had to go an replace them instead of bringing up the more needed melee,screw the clerics,i am so tired of everyone saying clerics are the needed class.<br>
<br>
Good whine?i don't care,going back t0 sleep for another few hours,after being up soo long,i usually need 17 hours of sleep.<br>

 Good raid, I had a blast, saw no harmony armor but I did get some gems tho, as for the 2nd wave, hey, ya gota do what ya gotta do. But i was kinda pissed when we were on the second floor and most people said they were going to leave so i thought &quot;what the hell, i've been sitting here for 16 hours, my ass hurts and I need to get some sleep&quot; so I mem a gate and Vec mentions the idea of going back to the first floor, then all of the sudden, some of the clerics decided they wanted to stay....<br>

It was tremendous fun and the first floor kiris, clerics, banshees, and revs actually dropped their fair share of loot.  I'm happy to hear from most of you that you had a great time.  One of the biggest thrills in raiding the planes is to see people I know and people I'm &quot;getting to know&quot; acquire new improved goodies.<br>
<br>
I pull the planes because I love to FD pull.  (Yes, Hate definitely holds the record (by far) on my times killed, but THAT is what makes it most exciting of the 3 planes to pull)<br>

<br>
If you enjoyed this daytime raid, look for another one I'm putting together for next week.  I'll be posting the details later today.  I'm very experienced in Hate/Fear/PoG and I'm going to leave it up to you to decide where we go next.<br>
<br>
Here's how its going to work: When I post the raid (later today), I'm going to ask you to post WHAT Plane you'll be willing to attend and the order you prefer.  Depending upon WHO (what classes) sign up for what Plane . . . will decide where we go.<br>
<br>
I'm looking at this Monday (7am CST/8am EST) again.  If we have enough responses by Friday, I'll announce where we're going at that time.<br>
<br>
A few comments about PoG: <br>
<br>
(1) I'll be taking a TANK-heavy force to raid PoG<br>
(2) Enchanters will SCREW their Epic chances if they attend<br>
(3) Anyone banking on Tunare/Faydwer faction... dont go<br>
(4) There is NO Breakin time required... VERY simple (trust me)<br>
(5) We'll need a higher-level raid force for PoG<br>
<br>
Once again, thanks for the great time... hope to see you this Monday in Hate, Fear, or PoG!<br>

Then on top of that, during the waiting period, I was trying to be very kind and patient only sending you vec 1 tell knowing you would be busy pulling and later sending 1 tell to Malik when Banisher or Gwaen told me too, to see if we could go up.  I then recieved a non so pleasant reply.  I was quite furious about that for I had done nothing to anyone yet and have just been waiting on the portal.  From there I left thinking all of you were going to act like that which is why I posted. My apoligies to everyone especially you Vec.<br>

<br>
I accept your apologies.  I want to say one thing in defense of Matik: I put him on the spot by asking him to deal with all the unhappy people for me.  Yes, I did it for the sake of keeping the raid moving forward, but it was unfair to him.<br>
<br>
As you may have noticed, I've done away with the concept of signing up for 2 separate parts of my next raid.  I believe this will avoid the situation you (and others) unfortunately were caught in.<br>
<br>
In addition, my reply back to each of you in this thread was rather pointed and I apologize for the offensive wording it contained.<br>

It did start 2 hours late due to almost half the people not showing up but you got it up and running quickly considering the situation.  Although my EM legs never did drop, I was very happy to see the other clerics get some much needed EM armor, and the loots were far more plentiful than I have seen as of late, Congratulations to all that got some &quot;phat lewts&quot;.  On a side note, I wasnt aware that you were supllying clerics with peridots, as I personally went through 2 stacks while i was up and was only compensated with a single ruby (at least i got some compensation, thats more than i can say for some raids i've been on).<br>
<br>
now for my flame:<br>

I love this comment makril, I spent 10 hours on this raid, from the time it was supposed to start (sitting in so ro for 2 hours while being unindated by level 30 and under people crying for a res cause a SG killed em in oasis), till the time that the second floor was supposed to start, I never intended to be there past 4 o'clock ET as I had to work that day at 6 o'clock and was almost late because I DIDN'T leave till the replacements got there (and that was shortly after 5 o'clock).<br>
Your bullshit attitude towards clerics must stem from a deep rooted time when you were level 12 and some 50+ cleric wouldnt run across 15 zones to give you a 49+ res so you wouldnt have to waste those 15 minutes to get back your measly exp you lost.  you complained as some of were leaving that &quot; it's nice to see all the clerics leave after they received so much loot, when we are finally going to the second floor to get phat lewt for the other classes&quot; Well i got news for ya jagoff, some of us clerics up there didnt get any lewt, and even more didn't get any compensation for the peridots they had to use to buffs the 4 tanks they kept alive in their group, but this is the norm for clerics, we are used to eating the cost of numerous stacks of peridots on every raid we attend.<br>
If it wasnt for one particular cleric this raid would have taken a lot longer to get started as we had a huge wipe out at the begining and only one cleric survived to bring the raid back up and running and I dont remember hearing any thanx from you for that.  If you think clerics aren't a &quot;needed class&quot; on raids, pls feel free to run YOUR next raid without any, but don't give me a tell later on asking me to help res you cause you failed like the moron you are.  jagoffs like you are the reason I stopped playing my cleric for months, and quite frankly I have no tolerence for any of your stupidity!!!!!<br>
<br>
*end of flame*<br>
<br>
In closing, VEC you do an awesome job running pickup raids, and I will gladly follow you into any plane you choose to go in the future.  Thanx for the invite and hope to do it again sometime.<br>
