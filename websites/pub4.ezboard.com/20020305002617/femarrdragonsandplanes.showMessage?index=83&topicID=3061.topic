<br>
I think Popplo stepped over the line. However, it's Popplo, to be expected. Lord knows back in the days of MS some people posted problems of his rantings, however, Popplo = good guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Damn fine monk too (after i had to recover his corpse at shrooms)<br>
<br>
Next, about Nire's application to MF in general. Although i'm not in MF, nor have ever been, nor will i ever probably be (damn you Tuan), i can say lots of people in &quot;MS&quot; used to have problems with Nire from the haydays of everquest. And in that sense, would never &quot;forgive&quot; Nire for something he did back when he was lvl 20. Simply put, some people simply aren't willing to forget something that happened, no matter how long ago. Some people just don't believe that people change. These people wouldn't forgive Nire if he stole a chocolate bar from the kid across the street when he was 6. However, that's there perogitive. If they can't &quot;forgive and move on&quot;, so is life, unfair.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, i think Nire was a cool guy, probably just slightly miffed. However, his actions are unjustified, and i know from being in MS, where we had a similiar incident, that i did not look kindly apon it. <br>
<br>
I end my rantings here with the following insights:<br>
<br>
Tuan = Dorf.<br>
Popplo = Asshole<br>
Nirecnad = Wrong<br>
Ablazen = What the fuck was i thinking when i made a Erudite (but i will still kick your ass)<br>

You were bounced from MF months ago. Get over it. I know you have tried to quit EQ at least twice before, is this a last ditch effort to burn your bridges behind you? That's the only explanation I can come up with for your pre-pubescent voyeuristic behavior and masturbatory posts on EZ Board. Stop fondling your resentments, real and imagined dude, and get on with your life.<br>
<br>
I threw your name up in SF's recruitment forum because people who &quot;use&quot; to be your loyal friends encouraged me to give you a chance. What a mistake. There were a lot of reasons you were rejected from MF and the bulk of them had nothing to do with old animosity. Things like being percieved as unskilled, one dimensional player, sub 60, having low raid time, running your mouth instead of listening, preoccupation with loot and trying to run the show instead of learning how to fit in all worked against you. <br>
<br>
You are a sorry mother fucker Nire but at least you are an equal opportunity asshole. You shit all over the friends who stood up for you right along with your imagined enemys. <br>
<br>
Way to go Ace. There can never be a doubt now that the right decision was made in rejecting your ungrateful, skill lacking, morally bankrupt, loyalty lacking, self serving sorry excuse for a Paladin ass.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to say I did not vote against you. I'm glad my guildies had more sense then me. <p><center><img src=http://www.pythonpete.com/photos/ackmanMF.gif border=1></a>

Is that allowed?<br>
<br>
<br>
On a more serious note, I am all for reputations in EverQuest meaning something. I believe that every action should have a consequence and I believe that /movelogs often give a person the chance to duck a reputation that should stick.<br>
<br>
However, some people obviously need to grow up. What someone does 2 years ago should probably best be forgotten.<br>
<br>
How many times did MS members scream &quot;FARMER&quot; at Da'Kor and vice versa. It was accepted practice on these boards so it's interesting to see it being brought up now so long after it was forgotten. Does anyone hold it against MS and DK for doing so? No, it stopped a while back and we forgave.<br>
<br>
It's very interesting to see that without exception every member of MF to post to this thread to date did not veto Nire's application. In fact several supported him actively. Which seriously makes me think that when a small minority veto an application to a guild that someone should step in and ascertain whether that Veto is for the proper reasons.<br>
<br>
/em goes off in search of marshmallows on the basis it may be allowed. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

It's a left over from board meetings with smaller numbers or low level politics, and was put in place to avoid the embarrassment of saying &quot;No. I don't support that and if you carry on I'll take my ball and play elsewhere&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not saying this is what it is used as in MF but what veto'ing has become over the years is an easy way to say no to immediately block something that you don't appreciate. It was once a serious measure but now a veto is banded about lightly.<br>
<br>
You and you alone will know why you vetoed Nire. I won't ask you what that reason is because as we can clearly see guild business should remain just that. I'll leave it to your conscience to think whether your veto was justified. I refuse to challenge your right to say no in any way.<br>
<br>
However up until your post nobody had mentioned anything other then support for Nire.<br>
<br>
As a guildmember of MF you also have to look to see if everyone is using their right to veto in the spirit it was originally meant. Or is it just some way of stopping a person from getting into the guild without giving a proper reason. Where personal judgements and begrudgements go against the better interest of the guild.<br>
<br>
I'm more then sure that MF can deal with this in their own way.<br>
<br>
Nire, you blew your chances with MF. Had you spoken to the powers that be, and politefully asked that the application be reconsidered on the basis that you felt you we're being treated unfairly then you might be somewhere today. And you may have maintained more of your friends list.<br>
<br>
However, it's not as bad as it looks from this post. People will forgive in time and you'll maintain your circle of close friends. Which often is more then enough to carry you through a bad time. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
  First of all, Midnight Fury's recruiting policies are guild policies.  I'm sure, that with hindsight, we should have realised that we should have consulted with everyone on the server before... nah.  I don't think so.<br>
<br>
  Secondly, did you even stop to think that maybe, just maybe we anticipated this sort of thing ahead of time and put policies in place that mean that you can't veto without giving a reason?<br>
<br>
  Thirdly, didn't the thought cross your mind that if Nirecnad pulled this crap, that maybe our 'small minority' was right all along?<br>
<br>
  Fourthly, what the hell business is it of yours?  Oh, thats right.... NONE.<br>
<br>
  Fifthly, who's going to step in?  Hello?  Is there some auditor of guilds I'm unaware of?  Are we in violation of some code of hiring red-shirted ensigns that I'm unaware of?<br>
<br>
  Lastly, and I'm going to do this slowly so you can understand this:  MF hold that the right of an existing guildmate to not have someone in the guild they feel uncomfortable with is more important to us than making sure that every scrub that approaches us gets a 'fair' shot.  <br>
<br>
  News flash Sparky:  we're under no obligation to recruit ANYONE if we don't want to.  <br>
<br>
  Skill is important, yes.  However, more than anything else we look for people we want to see in /gu every day.  People we trust.  People who are respectful of their guildmates.  And, finally, people who contribute to the guild in such a way that our guild is the stronger for having them there.<br>
<br>
  We've turned down many applications.  Not many people make it to the probationary period because, frankly, we can afford to be picky.  We reserve the right to give Jesus Christ the boot if he doesn't get on with our more... eccentric guildmates.<br>
<br>
  In closing, don't even TRY to pin this on MF.  Nire's actions have brought him to this point.  If he hadn't pissed off some of our members so much that they voted against him, he'd be in MF now.  If he hadn't posted stuff from our private boards to this one, he'd still have my respect.  All he has now are memories.<br>
<br>
  He <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> was</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> given a chance.  He <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> could</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have convinced the members of MF that he deserved to join us.  He failed.  And you know, that might have just been one of the best calls we as a guild ever made.<br>

Paraphrased a little but that answer is fine and all that anybody was looking for.<br>
<br>
Nobodys pinning anything on Midnight Fury at all but would you like me to post how unfair MF was so your defence has relevance? It's not what I think but I'll post it if you want.<br>
<br>
Oh and Mitch, personally I am against you being banned from the board based on the fact that your main character is on another server. Yes, we disagree on many things but a difference of opinion is not call enough for that. However before you post a little snippet like that one you might consider that if it's no business of mine it's certainly not any business of yours to get involved. At least it does involve my playing environment.<br>

  Well, I'll certainly sleep better knowing that we followed the Kerryn Approved™ rules for the dismissal of a probationary member.  <br>
<br>
  In other words.  It's none of your business.  We are under no obligation to justify <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of this to you.  Your opinion has no bearing on this at all.<br>
<br>
  The guild made the decision.  The guild has seen that decision vindicated.  The guild is impolitely telling you now to fuck off, seeing as the hints in my reply above don't seem to have got the message through to you.<br>

To those that keep saying it's only because of something that Nire did when he was 40, you skipped some posts.  There were a few that posted here that gave other reasons for his not getting in (loot obsessed, know-it-all attitude, running his mouth when he should be listening, etc).  So please, drop the &quot;forgive and forget&quot; crusade.  At any rate, it doesn't matter.  Like Laoke said, it's not our business, they don't have to justify their reasons for not wanting him to us.  They are under no obligation to the readers of this board, the greater EMarr community, VI, the Pope, your mom to explain anything to us.
