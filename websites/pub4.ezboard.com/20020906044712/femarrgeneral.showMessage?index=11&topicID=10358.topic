Siilver I am Christened and Confirmed Catholic as well, still doesn't stop me thinking they are one of the most backward, money whording, evil religions in the world.<br>
<br>
I mean really lets take up an offering every week to help poor and starving people, in the meanwhile the fat arse brain dead pope sits on his throne in the vatican, the vaults in the vatican contain millions and millions of dollars worth of treasure and yet they still ask everyone to give 10% of whatever they earn to the church. It's straight up BS.<br>
<br>
It's a business not a religion.<br>

<br>
So, becoming outraged and taking action is the same as making a general assumption that all priests are rapist pedophiles?<br>
<br>
As long as you're thinking like that, why don't I put a little quote in my sig saying something along the lines of:<br>
<br>
&quot;Help the American economy keep jobs in the country, kill a Nike Employee.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not Catholic, however I believe your quote, (Joking or not) is truely in poor poor taste. <br>
<br>
&quot;Help the banks, kill a jew&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh no! Wait a second... this happened before... what was it... what was it...?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to put words into your mouth, but I hope you can see how offensive that quote can be to some people, and atleast re-think it's significance to others. <p><center>leet sig will go here when I can think of something remotely witty.

But I think the point being made, though calous, is that people are simply taking this outrage sitting down, some are even trying to defend it.  The catholic religion (and I say this as a recovering catholic) is all about guilt, and if people feel too guilty to say what needs to be said, then nothing will be done about it.  Vaaprak has already been banned from this board, that's how scared people are and how quick they are to react to saying the slightest thing wrong about priests.  Though inflamatory, Vaaprak made his point very well.  There are some things and some issues that you really can't be worried about being politically correct about.<br>
<br>
If people continue to just mindlessly do as they're told and believe what the church tells them without question then nothing will be done.  Nothing justifyied anyway.  I for one don't think the decision about what to do with a priest who rapes a child is an issue for the church.  It should be pretty clear cut, he goes to prison like any other child rapist.  And what should happen to the Cardinal who knowingly hid the crime and enabled the criminal to prey on other victims by moving him to other parishes? Well there's a name for that too, it's called conspiracy and it carries jail time as well.  Why should there be a double standard for priests?<br>
<br>
If I was running a chain of daycare centers and had a problem with one of my workers raping children and my solution was to just keep move him around to my other daycare centers when things got to hot at the one he was currently at, do you think I'd be giving a deposition months afterwards?  No, I'd of been in prison for quite some time now.  And to be honest, if my child had been raped as a result of Cardinal Law's game of &quot;hide the pedofile&quot; I'd be looking to get him killed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uedgel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edgel</A> at: 8/13/02 8:54:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaishen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aishen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1118<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/13/02 8:58:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10358.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%$ you.</span><hr size=1> Vaaprak, if you're going to throw stones at a religion based on recent events, you're seriously no better than others who instigate genocide over a generalization.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is that I'll bet in every religion, race, culture and nationality there have been sex offenders.  It just so happens that the American media loves nothing more than the downfall and marring of &quot;perfection.&quot;  Sex offenders within the halls of Catholicism?!  GREAT STORY!  Let's bring up every case of molestation done by a Catholic within the last decade and make it the discovery of a lifetime!<br>
<br>
I'll bet if the American people were on a witch hunt after Baptist sex offenders, they'd find just as much.  It's a matter of high publicity vs. low publicity.<br>
<br>
I've been an active person in the field of sexual crimes and domestic violence inflicted upon women and children for the last 7 years, and I can tell you, hate begets only hate, and your hate in response to the actions of individuals against that of followers of a worldwide religion will beget nothing more than added hate in return.<br>
<br>
Want action?  Start by realizing not every Catholic is a child molester.  If I wanted to generalize people based on their faith, I'd believe every southern Baptist was a racist p.o.s. not worth my time, but while I was roaming through the South, I found a good number of them were extremely hospitable and gracious.<br>
<br>
Yes, something must be done to stop child molestation and abuse.  I would know.  My mother was a victim of child molestation (as well as her sister) in their very own house by their cousin, and she was later on raped on the job by her supervisor working as a life insurance agent.  I lost 10 years of my childhood being with my mother while she was busy fighting appeal after appeal.<br>
<br>
I still would not dare to villify an entire faith based on the actions of few.  I am not a Catholic, but I respect all manners of faith because to attack one's faith is to attack their being and their integrity.<br>
<br>
Faith and culture are two things not to be taken lightly and not to be toyed with.  If you had said the same thing about Tibetan Buddhist Lamas, I would have been deeply offended.  So, I can somewhat understand where Siilver and Theo are coming from, since I am deeply religious myself.  <br>
<br>
I feel you owe an apology to the Catholic players who frequent this board.  You are free and entitled to your opinion, but that should never, ever tread on someone else's enjoyment of their time and life.  Once you've offended a person as deeply as you've offended Siilverain and Theodwyn, and possibly more who haven't spoken up, an apology is in order.  <br>
<br>
Like I said, you are free to hold whatever religion you're against in contempt, but to hurt the feelings of another human being based on your own crusade (especially when they've done nothing to spurn you) is crossing the line.  I applaud your action against crimes towards children, this initiative is something our country needs big time, but to offend each and every person of a particular race isn't the proper way to go about it.  What about the Protestant child molesters?  How about the Wiccan ones?  The Mormons?  The Buddhists?  Child molestation is a crime that transcends the confines of gender, race, and religion.<br>
<br>
As one human being to another, I really do think an apology is in order, because even though I am not Catholic, as a religious person, I was offended, as well.  Regardless of what someone else has done, it wasn't worth the hurt you may have inflicted on a fellow gamer. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaishen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aishen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/13/02 9:02:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umalevant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malevant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 230<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/13/02 9:54:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10358.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%$ you.</span><hr size=1> Eh... me and Catholicism parted ways amicably a while back.  We still go out for coffee from time to time, but the old magic just isn't there.<br>
<br>
Seriously, the flawed actions of flawed men do not a religion make.  I think the offenders are sick sick puppies, but just because a businessman rapes someone does not by extension mean that all businessmen are rapists... same deal applies here.   Hate the man, not the frock.  You can make a pretty valid argument about the bishops' handling of it, but even so that does nothing to detract from the faith itself.  I have only run into one faith that is a serious joke, and that is satanism (Sure we believe in god, let's root for the *other* guy!).<br>
<br>
Oh, and as far as wishing folks would be outraged and take action... scroll up, check out Siilv's post.  Looks like she got ticked off and... took action.

The catholic church is by no means the only church to have problems with sex offenders.  And the problem with child rapists in the catholic church is by no means only recent events.  Certainly the media sensationalizes it as a big scoop, but it's a very old and rampant problem in the church.  Odds are, take any two altar boys (past or present) and put them in a room together alone and you can watch them fidgit with uncomfortableness as they say nothing to each other.<br>
<br>
Your point about what would happen if Baptist sex offenders was suddenly front page news is true, but ponder this.  Would Baptist's stand for having one of their leaders do what Cardinal Law has been doing?  I mean come on we're talking about child rape here... we're not talking about the economy, or civil rights, or politics...  And I'm sure you know more about it than I since you're in the field of sex crimes, I'm sure I'd be floored to find out how common it is.  But for me that doesn't change the nature of it, it doesn't make it any less deserving of any slanderous attack just because it's more common than I know.  It still needs to be eviserated where ever and when ever it is found.<br>
<br>
I'm confused as to why catholics would be offended by such a statement.  I saw nothing stating that catholics are child rapists.  The attack was on the church organization, not the religion or it's members.  It was specifically targeted at priests.  Though a great many catholics would say &quot;they are the church&quot;, and it's a wonderful sentiment and on some socio/community level it's true.  But when it comes down to making a decision of which parish to send a known child rapist to, the members of the church had no say in it, it was the church organization.  The people of a faith, &quot;the believers&quot;, make up a religion.  They are what keeps it alive by their faith.  The ministers of it are just that, they are the church.  If you've ever been exposed to the Vatican, you quickly see the huge gap between the catholic religion and the catholic church.<br>
<br>
Many years ago a wise and learned man asked me. &quot;What does God do with worship?&quot;  I was taken aback, this man had been a driving force pushing me to learn as much as I could first hand, and to learn through asking questions, who I saw as a mentor, and yet we had never talked much about religion at all.  I remember not knowing what to say, and it was funny since I always had an opinion on everything in those days.  He then said, &quot;The real question is, why do you hesitate at that question?&quot;  Why are we afraid to point the finger at a priest?  It's kind of the same question.  I've been a recovering catholic for many years now, and I still pause at the question.  You can't imagine how insidious the guilt game is in the catholic church if you've not been exposed to it.  And if you have been for too long, you probrably can no longer tell the difference.  I watch my mother struggle in agony over her guilt (she's still an active catholic).  She hates what these priests have done, and because she knows that she hates the actions of a priest, she's knows she's committing a sin and her guilt is multiplied.  It's an inscidious guilt loop that is so common in my parent's generation.  Again, maybe this is more common in other religions than I know... <br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's ok to say all catholic priests are rapists because 14 have been proven to be, and 130something (I don't have the number in front of me) have complaints filed against them, and al the cardinals said it's &quot;basically&quot; ok if a priest only rapes a child once, and the pope was told all of this more than three months ago when the cardinals went to Rome.  And even assuming he knew nothing of this before hand, three months ago at  the very least he did, and here we stand more than three months later and the 14 known and the 130+ suspected are still &quot;ministering&quot;? You can't be seriously trying to asert the &quot;one bad apple&quot; theory here... The problem is very very big here, and if you rely on the &quot;ministers&quot; to solve the problem, you might as well go put your head in the sand and give the foxes the key to the hen house.<br>
<br>
Vaaprak also made an interesting comment about the four nuns that were pettioning to become priests.  It only took a matter of days to excommunicate them, but known child rapist priests....  Hmmm, lets think about that for a month or so, then well all meet in Dallas and think about it some more....   It's very sad, since these four women were most likey &quot;taking action&quot;.  No you certainly can't hold all accountable for the few (even when the few are many), but if you don't take action (and no, it doesn't have to be violent action) aren't you saying &quot;it's ok by you&quot;  If you don't like what's going on, then why not take action.  Send the vatican a letter explaining your distaste in their handling of the situation, don't give them money, send your district attorney a letter asking why these priest haven't been brought up on charges yet.  There are lots people could do, but aren't.  And if the &quot;aren't&quot;s continue, the matter will soon be forgotten when the nextr big news item draws our attention away from it, and it will be quietly swept under the rug.  &quot;Yeah, remember all that child sex scandal stuff with the catholic priests back in the early 2000's.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, what ever became of that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh the bishops took care of it.&quot;<br>
'Yeah I'm sure they must have, nothing to worry about anymore, thank goodness.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucnjmorris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cnjmorris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/13/02 11:01:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10358.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @#%$ you.</span><hr size=1> If catholics let priests get married, like God does, then this wouldn't be as large of an issue.<br>
<br>
I won't say it would solve the problem because child rape happens outside the catholic church.  It just happens that catholic priests are put in a position of trust and in the presence of too many victims.  They aren't any worse than others, they have just been given easier opportunity.<br>
<br>
Either way, catholic priests need to spend less time alone with children, and more time alone with the Bible.  They could learn a lot. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

Yes some priests abused their power and molested children.  The problem is that the Church chose to cover up these transgressions.  These are criminal acts, that they covered up.  And I still wouldn't have a huge problem with this if they had dealt responsibly with these people.  I'm not even saying you need to thrown them out of the priesthood, but how do they keep getting assigned to parishes where they will have oportunity to sin again?  Why were they allowed to keep molesting after the church knew they were doing so?  If it was murder would the church have the same view?  &quot;Well you killed one of your flock... so were going to transfer you to another church.  Don't worry we won't inform the police, and hey, could you try not to kill any one else?  k thanks.&quot;<br>
<br>
The church acted in an irresponsible manner and that is why many people are justifiably upset.  Is it unfair to lable all priests as pedophiles?  Yes, but the church acted in a way to invite this belief in the public.  How would you lable a group that lets it's members rape kids, and then will help cover it up, including paying hush money to the victum, and then place that very member in a position to do so again.<br>
<br>
There is a reason that the Church is paying hundreds of millions of dollars in court awards, it's becuase they acted in a criminal manner, it's just that simple.  If your cathlloic you should be pissed that your weekly tithes are going to pay for these awards, and settlemts instead of helping the poor.<br>

<br>
I forgot to address this before, I am not sure how Baptist Ministers work in America but in Australia they are allowed to be married, if the same is so in America then if they did go on a Baptist sex offender witch hunt, then I guarantee you they would find substantially less sex offenders than they would find in the Catholic Church.<br>
