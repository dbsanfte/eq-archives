Quote Warangel1: &quot;I did in fact put down some scientific evidence for creationism...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Scientific evidence for creationism&quot; is an oxymoron. The fundamental premise of the idea (perhaps &quot;hypothesis&quot; but that is too strong for Creationism) of creationism is that &quot;god created the heavens and the earth&quot;. In order to provide &quot;scientific evidence&quot; you will have to provide empirical arguments for the existence of God. Right? Just how do you propose to do that Warangel1? What physical evidence can you provide to demonstrate God is creator? Can you reproduce the act of God creating in the lab? For that matter, can you falsify the premise that &quot;God created&quot;? One of the fundamental rules in the creation of a hypothesis  (and perhaps theory) is that it is falsifiable. Just how can you falisfy the existence of God? I haust had to throw this in the mix because I get so tired of reading nonsense from the hands of Evangelical Creationists. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/19/01 7:17:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The point man, the point!</span><hr size=1> That difference between the "would be" and "is" you apparently did not quite grasp.

Also the Holy Bible is not regarded as a reliable scientific document, it doesn't lend any credibility to your premise that Supreme Being authenticity is supported merely by referring to it.   <br>

Lack of understanding the nature of God does not mean that there is no evidence of creation.  <br>
<br>
&quot;if God is unknowable by Man -ipso facto- &quot;God&quot; is not Real. &quot;<br>
<br>
A truly ignorant conclusion.  I suppose since a gnat cannot understand philosophy, religion, or physical entities like automobiles or computers then those things therefore do not exist - using your logic.<br>
<br>
If you would make some attempt at using real logic rather than fancy words and glittering generalities you might get a little further.<br>
<br>
My logic simply says that the gnat can see the evidence of the existance of humans, although the gnat is incapable of understanding their motivations and purposes.  In a similar way, we can see the evidence of the existance of God, although we may not be able fully understand his motivations and purposes.<br>

I haven't read it ina  bit, but I did kinda glance through the two posts on this board.<br>
<br>
Note to those talking about evolution vs. creationism..<br>
<br>
When discussing whether evolution or creationism is PROVABLE - what it really comes down to is actually not a religious vs. science debate.. but a science vs. science debate.<br>
<br>
Let me explain before you say.. wtf is she talking about?<br>
<br>
If you believe in creationism, more than likely you are basing your views off of the bible or some other religious teaching.  Without going into major detail in this post (though I can refer to specific examples if you would like), you can consider the bible simply a historical document, i.e. historical writings of the time, if you dont believe and /or don't want to accept the truth of God's word.  <br>
<br>
There have been many many SCIENTISTS who have dated writings of the bible, the dead sea scrolls, etc. and found them to be in the time frame the writers themselves say they are writing in.  <br>
<br>
Archelogically and geographiacally speaking, all sites/places that have been mentioned in the bible that have been found, or exist today (such as Jerusalem), are accurate!  Meaning if the bible says that Such and such city was at this location, and an archologist looks for and finds the city, guess what.. it is in that exact location.  I could go on, but I think you get the point!  Again, if you want specific exapmles, let me know, I shall look them up alnog with sources which you can also read for yourself, and post them here.<br>
<br>
So, scientifically speaking, the bible is accurate in many many ways, and even sceptics and non-believing SCIENTISTS admit that historically, geographically, and archeologically - the bible is accurate as far as they can scientifically attest.<br>
<br>
Now, moving on..  obviously those that believe solely in the evolution theory AND (notice I say AND) DO NOT believe at all in creationism usually base their ideas upon Darwinism, the theory of evolution taught in many many schools.  There was even an experiment by a scientist name Miller that &quot;proved&quot; that with the right mix of chemicals, that simple one celled organisms will spontaneously &quot;create.&quot;  I will discuss how this experiment is not valid later.<br>
<br>
Now, what we really come down to, and what I meant by my earlier statement about science vs. science is this:  those that believe in God and believe he created the universe do not usually need all this scientific explanation to believe.  They believe in God's word, and have faith in Him and trust that what He says is true.  The people that really need this scientific data are those that have doubts and those that do not believe, and those that refuse to believe unless science proves it.<br>
<br>
Please read the quotes below, stated by William Lane Craig, taken from the book &quot;The Case for Faith&quot; by Lee Strobel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Well, in the last 35 years, scientists have been stunned to discover that the Big Bang was NOT some chaotic, primordial event, but rather was a highly ordered event that required an enormous amount of information.  In fact, from the moment of its inception, the universe had to be fine-tuned to an incomprehensible precision for the existence of life.  And that points in a very compelling way toward the existence of an Intelligent Designer.<br>
<br>
Scientifically speaking, it is far more probable for a life-prohibiting universe to exist than a life-suistaining one.  Life is balanced on a  razor's edge.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Here a few examples cited by William Craig :<br>
<br>
Citing Hawking : <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  He (Hawking) has calculated that idf the rate of the universe's expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part ina  hundred thousand million million, the universe would have collapsed upon itself. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Other examples citied by Craig :<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  British physicist P.C.W. Davies has concluded the odds against the inital conditions being suitable for the formation of stars - a necessity for planets and thus life - is one followed by at least a thousand billion billion zeros.<br>
<br>
Davies also estimated that if the strength of gravity or of the weak force were changed by only one part in a ten followed by a hundred zeros, life could never have developed.<br>
<br>
There are about fifty constants and quantities - for example, the amount of usable energy in the universe, the difference in mass between protons and neutrons, the ratios of the fundamental forces of anture, and the proportion of matter to antimatter - that must be blanaced to amathematically infintesimal degree for any life to be possible.<br>
<br>
All of this (Craig says) amply supports the conclusion  that there's an intelligence behind creation.  In fact, the alternate explanations just dont add up. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now before you go nuts on me, please also read the following quotes, taken from the same boof, but this time stated by Walter L. Bradley, PH.D. (in science - most of his expertise lies in polymers and thermodynamics)<br>
<br>
Before I quote them, please remember that the basic theory that is widely accepted is that the Big Bang caused our universe to form, the conditions stabilized into a &quot;prebiotic soup&quot; if you will, with energy supplied by lightening, and over a period of billions of years, linked together and simple life emerged ... meaning one celled organisms.  In fact, Stanley Miller, PH.D., decided to test this.  He recreated the atmosphere of the primitave earth, shot electiricty through it, and boom.. life was created.  One proble, - the chemicals used in the experiment were  ammonia, methane, and hydrogen.  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> quote} From 1980 on, NASA scientists have shwon that the primitive earth never had any ammonia, methane, or hydrogen to amount to anything.  it was instead co[mposed of water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.  More recent experiments have confirmed this.  So the scientific signifigance of Miller's experiment today.. is zilch.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now I could go on and on.. but i will give jsut one more quote:<br>
This is how Bradley answerted when asked what his own best hypothesis is on the origin of life:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If there isn't a natural explanation and there doesn't seem to be the potential of finding one, then I believe it's appropriate to look at a supernatural explanation.  I think its the most reasonable inference based on the evidence.<br>
<br>
You don't see a problem in saying that the best explanation seems to be an Intelligent Designer?&quot; (asked Strobel.)<br>
<br>
Absolutely not.  I think people who believe that life emerged naturalisitcally need to have a great deal more faith than people who reasonably infer that there's an Intelligen Designer.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Now, to finish my points.<br>
<br>
Most people who believe in creationism dont need the evidence, they have faith that this is so.<br>
<br>
For those that need this scientific data, those with doubt, or those who do not believe, or those who seek to PROVE there is NO God, they inevitable turn to science.<br>
  <br>
Hence, my science vs. science statement.<br>
<br>
And science fails us.  We have been able to go back to the Big Bang, but we cannot explain scientifically how life emerged, how such a delicate balance came into being to allow life to be sustained in this universe.<br>
 <br>
The one celled organism that Darwin and others thought was so simple, is actually <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> more complex than anything we've been able to recreate through supercomputers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> (Bradley)<br>
<br>
I know my answer.  I believe in God, and I have faith in His word.  <br>
<br>
But I did have a friend who systematically searched and researched and read books, and methodically, logically tried to discover God.  He read so many books, where do you hink I got this stuff.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am not bashing anyone in this post, I haven't visited it in some time, but I wanted to point out the science vs. science aspect.  <br>
<br>
Here are a couple good books that you can find information in, I have included the book which I quoted from today:<br>
<br>
The Case for Faith, Lee Strobel<br>
The Case for Christ, Lee Strobel<br>
Darwin's Black Box, Michael Behe<br>
Reasonable Faith, William Lane Craig<br>
Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, Michael Denton<br>
The Case for Christianity, Dennis McCallum<br>
Finding Darwin's God, Kenneth Miller<br>
Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis<br>

Lukaria I understand that the nature of the media this topic is being discussed in is very limiting, but you have made some very controversial generalizations above without a single supporting argument. I want to take a moment to outline just what nobody should do when attempting to present an argument... never make an unsupported generalization then lift a quote from some book as if it supports your generalization. The fallacy is an appeal to authority. Sure it is good to quote references but only after you have specifically made your case with a valid argument.<br>
<br>
Lukaria those who &quot;need... scientific data&quot; are not all &quot;doubters&quot; or non-believers. I have many Christian friends who think evolution is a FACT.<br>
<br>
We can explain scientifically how life emerged on this planet. Scientists have been providing such explanations for a very long time! Scientists have even provided the statistical analysis for the possibility of life on other planets.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Your &quot;science vs science&quot; statement makes no sense. A scientific theory must be falsifiable. If it is not then it is not useful. The fundamental premise of Creationism is that &quot;God created x&quot;. Can the Creationist falsify that premise? Is Creationism falsifiable? If it is please demonstrate just how you would test the premise &quot;God created x&quot;. To date, I have as yet to see one Evangelical Christian who thinks of Creationism as a genuine &quot;scientific theory&quot; outline just how they would falsify that premise. If the premise can be falsified through empirical processes then I will agree Creationism can qualify as a scientific theory.<br>

<br>
Uh, yeah. Do me a favor, Einstein.<br>
<br>
Give me an example of a closed system in the physical world. Go on.<br>
<br>
The hesitation you're feeling is due to the fact that you've never seen one. You never will. They don't exist. A closed system is just as fantastic a construct as polkadotted elephants...no, strike that. It'd be easier to find such an elephant.<br>
<br>
As such, it has no real place in a discussion about physics.<br>
<br>
<br>
Secondly...your familiarity with the arguments of scientists doesn't mean you have any real talent for the practice of science. Taking potshots at the Big Bang theory doesn't automatically prove the existence of God.<br>
<br>
The lack of dandelions in the yard does not indicate the presence of an oak tree. It just indicates the absence of dandelions. So, problems (real or imagined) with an unproven theory of astrophysics do not constitute proof of God.<br>
<br>
And for some perspective? There were minor flaws in Newton's calculations for gravtitation...and no doubt people like you probably had a ball pointing them out.<br>

Aside from this the fact still stands, that there is a world of difference between "Ought" and "Is"; whether there ought to be a Supreme Being simply does not answer the "Is" of Nature. Neither a priori nor a posteriori do you ever go close to defining the crossover mark between language and existing. That is one failure you will never overcome for you do not have sufficient intellect to stop at logical impossibility. Let alone grasp the truth.        <br>
<br>
To borrow from your own words: "If you would make some attempt at using real logic rather than fancy words and glittering generalities you might get somewhere".<br>

First, your 'quote'.<br>
<br>
&quot;This from Steven Hawkings :<br>
&quot;If we accept the Theory that space is expanding we have essentialy three fates for the universe.<br>
...<br>
2)The Universed is “Closed”.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
First: That 'quote' is NOT from Hawking, you sorry twit. It's from a freshman paper written for a COMPOSITION class. He doesn't attribute the information to Hawking at all, which is to his credit. You, however, apparently failed to grasp that.<br>
<br>
Second, let's try looking at the ENTIRE quote, without your judicious editing.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we accept the Theory that space is expanding we have essentialy three fates for the universe.<br>
<br><br>
1) The Universed is considered “Open”.  Space is expanding so quickly<br>
gravity cannot hold it back-it keeps expanding forever...&quot;<br>
<br><br>
&quot;2)The Universed is “Closed”. There is to much gravitaional attration and the universe eventually starts to contract in on itself...&quot;<br><br>
<br>
&quot;3)The Universe is “Critical”.  The expansion and gravititional attraction are connenct the universe is always on the edge of open/closed...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Interesting. So our aspiring academic has concluded that the universe is either closed, open, or going back and forth?<br>
<br>
NO KIDDING. My bedroom door is either closed, open or going back and forth. That's my theory, and geewhiz it sure is conclusive!<br>
<br>
Gimme a break, Einstein. And spare me the freshman lit major interpretation of Hawking.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, let's talk about your other problem. You've confused a subset of astrophysics theory with basic systems theory.<br>
<br>
When our earnest freshman pal refers to the universe as closed, he's using a specific term from a specific theory.<br>
<br>
When a systems theorist mentions a &quot;closed system&quot;, he or she refers to a system that exists utterly without external influence. Such a system is entirely theoretical, as one has never been observed in our physical universe.<br>
<br>
Moreover, if we assume that there is any truth to basic quantum physics theory, the universe cannot be closed, as we have particles coming and going constantly. Unless you imagine that God has a secret bag of subatomic particles that he uses just to toy with physicists.<br>
<br>
<br>
So not only did you misquote, you took it upon yourself to selectively edit a quote in order to support your position. It was ultimately futile, since the quote you butchered doesn't even apply to what I said.<br>
<br>
Mr. Wizard, if you want to continue this, may I suggest that you:<br>
<br>
1. Learn to read formal papers, and how to quote them appropriately.<br>
2. Acquaint yourself with the meanings of the basic scientific terms you're using. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwarangel1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WarAngel1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/19/01 7:27:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you believe in god?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Interesting.

You're right, that was his interpretation of hawking.  However, those 3 theories of the universe are what you will generally find to describe the universe in any astronomy or astrophysics discussion, and the closed system model is the one that fits with the Big Bang theory.  If you dont believe that, check out :<br>
 www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part9/section-6.html<br>
<br>
The 3 models he describes are correct.<br>
<br>
The Big Bang Theory is dependant on the universe being closed, since all matter and energy would be unable to escape the gravity of the universe.  That would be a perfectly closed system.<br>
<br>
In any case, im not going to post any more replies so go on whatever childish diatribes you wish.  I've made my case pretty well and I think Lukaria made some very good points as well, but you have both chosen to twist and turn every word and logical argument into an insult, to make childish cutdowns and generally show yourselves incapable of any serious discussion.<br>
<br>
One day you will find out the truth, most likely the hard way.<br>

No, they all fit. Those &quot;theories&quot; are speculations on the amount of MASS that exists in the post-Big Bang universe.<br>

No, it isn't and no, it wouldn't. Even if the universe has sufficient mass to retract, it still isn't a &quot;closed system&quot;. Because everytime an electron flits in and out of our existence, it 'leaves' our universe.<br>

<br>
Trech, you are correct :  there was not single celled organisms created in Stanley Miller's experiment ! /blush.  Sorry about that!<br>
<br>
I had so much I was typing, I am afraid I did not get that quite correct.  After your post, I reread the document I was citing from , here is the CORRECT information:<br>
<br>
 Stanley Miller conducted an experiment in which he recreated the the atmosphere of the primitive eart (meaning before life) in a laboratory and shot electricity through it.  Before long, Stanley Miller found that amino acids - the building blocks of life - had been created. <br>
<br>
At the time, many thought it proved conclusively that life could have emerged from nonliving chemicals.<br>
<br>
Hence - the origin of life truly could be just as had been theorized - that given enough time and the proper conditions and chemicals - amino acids and then life would result.<br>
<br>
<br>
This experiment however, proved to be inconclusive, as the chemicals Miller used were ammonia, methane, and hydrogen.  Nasa scientists have shown that primitive earth never had any methane, ammonia, or hydrogen to amount to anything.  instead primitve earth was composed of water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen -  and the experiment cannot yeild the same results with this mixture.  Therefore, Miller's experiment was basically thrown out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for pointing that out so that I could make the correction!.<br>
<br>
If you would like to read further on this, I took the information from Lee Strobel's, The case for Faith.  In it, he cites his scientific examples.  You can find all the sources you need there!.<br>

<br>
First let me clarify a few things.  I did re-read my post and can see where some confusion maybe drawn.<br>
<br>
Clarifications:<br>
<br>
1)  First off, this was not an argument that I presented at all.  Its food for thought.  It's something to turn your wheels and make you think deeper, and perhaps even do a bit more research on.  I even gave books that I drew some of the information from, so that others might do their OWN research and satify their own curiosity and questions.<br>
<br>
Basically, it is an opinion.<br>
<br>
The fact that I cited quotes from books does not make me any kind of authority, nor did I presume to place myself upon that pedastal.  Its too easy to fall from those, don't you think.  With that in mind, moving on..<br>
<br>
2)  I, in fact, mixed two differrent (completely different) things into one.  So let me separate them.<br>
<br>
It would have been better for me to state the following :<br>
<br>
Those that believe in creationism usually do not need the scientific evidence [bold]in order to believe in God[/bold].<br>
<br>
Those that need scientific data, those that have doubts in the existence of God due to science, or those that who do not believe in God AND (meaning all of the above) reject creationism as the origin of life... usually need scientific evidence to either prove or disprove this. (see below for a statement regarding this issue)<br>
<br>
Although in my orgional post I applied this to evolution, upon re-reading it, I see that most of my statements and quotes were in fact about the origin of life - not evolution.  <br>
<br>
So, forget the evolution thing.  I will only say this in response to the evolution arguments - I do believe you are correct in that we have scientifically said that evolution has occurred.  However, I bet we differ ( but maybe not ) in that I believe evolution has still been a tool of God, not just a combination of time, circumstance, and ecological factors.  I am not saying those things do not exist and have not been proven.  On the contrary, I agree with them.  I am saying that I believe God was behind it, or an Intelligent Designer as many scientists would say.<br>
<br>
3) I shall explain once more my &quot;science vs. science statement.&quot;  I do not believe I ever said creationism is a scientific theory.  If I did, pardon me as I am not a scientist.  Instead, what I meant to convey is this:<br>
<br>
Many scientists today cannot explain the origin of life.  I am talking about before the Big Bang, not amino acids, not single celled organisms.  I am talking about the true origin of life.  <br>
<br>
Many scientists today believe there is an Intelligent Desiner behind all this.  If you do not believe me, I can post places where you can research this yourself.  In fact, scientists are basically deadlocked over this issue.  It all comes down to debating the current theories, but no new breakthroughs have come in awhile to explain anything before the Big Bang or why it occurred. Of course, the ultimate result is life here on earth and US, humans.<br>
<br>
What I am trying to point out with the science vs. science issue is this : those that believe God created the universe do not USUALLY need complete scientific evidence.  At some point, we make a leap of faith to trust God and His word.  That does not mean we automatically think that scientists are wrong or that evolution is a sham.  Of course there wss evolution, of course we can look at scientific evidence of amino acids the building blocks of life.  However, that does not in any way disprove the existence of God or his design of the universe.  Just because I believe in God doesn't mean I am stupid or close minded at all.  I simply believe that God used the big bang to create life, and has had a hand in the development of life from the get go.  On a personal note, I might add I am not of a sect of Christians that believes that the world is only 5000 years old and that the seven days meant seven twetny four hour days.<br>
<br>
Sorry I tend to ramble.<br>
<br>
Basically what I mean is that those who get involved in atmepting to prove that God does NOT exist always turn to science.  And those that &quot;need&quot; scientific evidence of God's existence also turn to science (and also history and archeology). <br>
<br>
We always end up with one side trying to &quot;prove&quot; the non-existence of God, and the other trying to &quot;prove&quot; his existence to dismiss their own doubts.<br>
<br>
I hope that finally made sense.<br>
<br>
In the end, science has not priven the existence of God, and it has not in any way proven the non-existence of God.<br>
<br>
I used my friend as an example.  He is a studious, serious, and exptrememly cautios, intelligent individual.  He approached this issue like he would a doctoral thesis.  He did the research on both sides of the coin.<br>
<br>
What Brett ultimately came up with, and what many others have deduced, is that there is a lot of compelling information  - historical, archeological, and scientific -  that God does in fact exist.  BUT.. there is not concrete, no nonsense look here is my hand if you prick it it bleeds evidence for absolutely everything.  You are still requied to make a leap of faith.<br>
<br>
At the root of it, the decision to take that leap of faith is an act of will.  If you want to believe you will.  If you don't want to, you will be able to explain away all the evidence intellectually, emotionally, and physically.<br>
<br>
God is there for those who want to reach him, that I know is true.  Those that truly seek him with all theri hearts will be found by God.  That i do believe.<br>
<br>
I do not know if you are a Christian, or what faith you are if any.  But God will answer if you ask him into your heart sincerely.  The Holy Spirit will  move within you, and your life will change.  It doesnt mean you aren't human and that you won't sin and mess up !  But you;ll have God on your side.<br>
<br>
Let me ask you this -  if you do not believe in God, really examine why.  At the heart of it, most people do not want the responsibility of faith, or of giving up their immoral lives, or of what they view as the giving up of their own will.<br>
<br>
<br>
Think of this:<br>
<br>
If one day thunder broke out overhead, the Heavens parted, fire rained down, a huge towering divinity decended upon a cloud, looked at you and said Muzaak, your questions are answered, I do exist......<br>
<br>
you would still have a choice!!!<br>
<br>
If you wanted to believe, you would think &quot;ITS GOD!&quot;<br>
<br>
If you didn't, you would find some way to explain it away.<br>
<br>
  <br>
At the heart of it, its your choice.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough of this post.<br>
<br>
I certainly hope that I clarified my earlier post for you.  Feel free to ask for references... I don't joke when I say I have them.  <br>
<br>
And for those who care - much of the scientific information I spouted off here, and even some of the examples are from readings I have done  -  namely The Case for Christ and the Case for Faith, and Darwin's Black Box.<br>
<br>
Shamless plagurism.. I admit it now freely.  Sue me =P<br>
<br>
Happy reading to all.<br>

Problems arise with how we present our opinions. I stated that if you are to argue a point then do so with a good argument. Opinions are better framed within a logical structure most of the time. I see you just want to clearly state you will not be presenting formal arguments.<br>
<br>
Quoting Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;Those that believe in creationism usually do not need the scientific evidence [bold]in order to believe in God[/bold].<br>
<br>
Those that need scientific data, those that have doubts in the existence of God due to science, or those that who do not believe in God AND (meaning all of the above) reject creationism as the origin of life... usually need scientific evidence to either prove or disprove this. (see below for a statement regarding this issue)....&quot;<br>
<br>
I am still not sure exactly what you hope to do with the above dichotomy. Are you trying to present a dilemma? Are you saying the person who has a need for evidence is somehow wrong, or maybe inferior to the person of faith? Hmmm... let's move forward:<br>
<br>
Quoting Lukaria:<br>
<br>
&quot;Basically what I mean is that those who get involved in atmepting to prove that God does NOT exist always turn to science. And those that &quot;need&quot; scientific evidence of God's existence also turn to science (and also history and archeology). <br>
<br>
We always end up with one side trying to &quot;prove&quot; the non-existence of God, and the other trying to &quot;prove&quot; his existence to dismiss their own doubts.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you are taking your generalizations too far. There is no one side versus the other as you describe above. I have as yet to read the work of any scientist who does research with the hope of proving that there are no deities (including the Christian trinity). In my opinion, what you are saying Lukaria is a figment of that Christian imagination of yours, I am sorry to say. In general, science doesn't deal with the god factor for many good reasons but the best reason comes from William of Ockham. Ockham said that entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity. What this means is that the best explanation is the one that can account for a phenomena without assuming the existence of an entity to explain the phenomena.<br>
<br>
The existence of God can't be demonstrated empirically. For the most part it is the work of theologians and philosophers to provide arguments for the existence of god. However, we still are not even close to the dichotomy you want to draw. The discipline of Apologetics has been practiced for hundreds of years. The early church fathers used the practice extensively. Apologetics is a rational discourse used to defend the teachings of the Christian church. Indeed, apologetics are used to define doctrine. Every believer wants an explanation... a reason to believe. Something to help them have faith.<br>

This will be the last sweeping generalization that I want to deal with. I am not sure you understand the issues involved or even the direction talk over the existence of god should go. He who affirms must provide evidence. The atheist does not affirm, but denies. It is the theist that provides positive arguments trying to make their case for god. The atheist can simply stand on the principle of parsimony (Ockham), trotting out godless scientific explanation after godless scientific explanation. I am sorry you find it difficult to deal with, Lukaria, but science doesn't need a god to work. AND, if someone wants to introduce god into the mix then they better be prepared to demonstrate why their explanation is better. Science is not at all about faith. You want faith, then go to church not to the lab. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, it is NOT science versus religion. I find it difficult to understand why some &quot;believers&quot; are so paranoid. Last time I checked Stephen Hawking was not wearing jack boots ready to march into homes and rip bibles out of people's hands! I am not a believer in god, but I have read enough to know that many theologians, philosophers, and scientists who believe in god are not fealing the pinch between faith and science. Somehow they manage to have their faith and science, too. :P<br>

There is just so much more I could write, but I have to go level up me Necro now...<br>
