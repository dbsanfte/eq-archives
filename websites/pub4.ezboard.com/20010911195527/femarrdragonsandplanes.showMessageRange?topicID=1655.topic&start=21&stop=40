Dest/Rimmuk you've killed VS several times already and while maybe it was your *turn* in a rotation decided among 3 guilds i'm sure it won't cause you to wet yourselves much more often than the present to lose 1 kill.  You say you *stole* Da`Kors turn once but *had the decency to repay it by letting them take your turn*.  Well ermm we haven't had the chance to repay that favour as yet so what exactly is the short term difference here?  <br>
<br>
Jaeden - haven't seen you doing much in the way of being nice to anyone.  Hypocrite?  You *camp* Faydedar (lol) and then when he spawns you kite him around while you attempt to gather what people you can.  Seemingly failing this every time you moan at whatever guild comes along to kill him and then flame them when they don't give you the pod.  Or you just flame the guild that kills him after you died because *you were camping him*.  I actually almost considered you a friend at one point but then a lot of tramps can seem nice on first impressions.<br>
<br>
As far as *using 46 people to kill a mob that doesn't have blah blah isn't much of an achievement*.. ok so should be turn people away when they want to help our guild?  Sorry the way DG runs doesn't suit your over-sized ego 8(  We must be in the wrong to want to help each other.  You say you didn't have the people when he was up.. well is that not your tough shit?  You expect the world to stop for you? What's at the centre of the Earth? I don't think it's a petty immature egotist somehow.  (Incase your mental capacity cannot comprehend the proportions of what i'm saying, i'll say it in *Fireman Sam* language - the world doesn't revolve around you)<br>
<br>
Anyway that's all i can think of for now.  Feel free to spend your day reading through my post picking quotes and making sarcastic remarks about each sentence.  I'm sure it will entertain me while i download my emails <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 As far as having 46 ppl there, I dont think it was nearly that many. But anyway who gives a shit? Noone was turned away =).<br>
 BTW hearing the words respect and consideration coming from Destian and Rimmuk was pretty god damn funny. <br>

<br>
The reason we &quot;stole&quot; VS was that the part of the guild that was on at the time was under the impression that we had to &quot;prove&quot; ourselves to get into the rotation. We got it worked out, and paid back what we took cause it was caused by miscommunication. <br>
<br>
Frankly i don't care about the VS since the servers came down, but since you don't seem to want to work together with other guilds the chance of you being fucked on spawns is that much bigger.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upyrastilia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyrastilia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/23/01 5:07:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The reason we &quot;stole&quot; VS was that the part of the guild that was on at the time was under the impression that we had to &quot;prove&quot; ourselves to get into the rotation.

<br>
Not really any different to what DG did from what i can fathom.  Like i said we haven't had the opportunity to pay back what we took.  Personally I like Storm's Fury and have good friends in the guild and all this bitterness is just spoiling it for both sides.  Ok we *stole* *your* spawn (forgot about the ownership tag hanging off his arm).  I seem to remember a previous VS attempt where SF kindly waited outside and after us giving up you took him.  No arguments there all politely sorted out.  Maybe it was just the friendly people involved there.<br>

<br>
And how has this changed since? I don't see any VS rotation rules &amp; regulations. Rimmuk, Callador and Destian just look hypocritical by coming here flaming us for something you did yourself.<br>
<br>
Granted, communication is the key and maybe we're guilty of not communicating with SF about our VS attempt, so for this I'm sorry. I'm sure that we can work something out to get into the VS rotation and repay our &quot;steal&quot; because let me assure you DG is not out to steal Uber spawns, or undermind other people's dragon attempts. If you knew about DG you would know this.<br>
<br>
Secondly, if communicating to become part of a rotation is the way it's done, then if DG requests to be part of the Trak rotation are we going to be told we're not able to kill him? Or will we allowed in without &quot;proving&quot; ourselves. Personally I think a guild should have to &quot;prove&quot; themselves before getting into a rotation but obviously that's not the way Destian Caladdor and Rimmuk think.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, does anyone else find these threats funny? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You fuck over people, and you will get fucked over by people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok so, for &quot;stealing&quot; your VS rotation you'll fuck us over? Do I need to remind you we're not on a PvP server? Perhaps you'll make it your life's ambition to steal all DG mobs? LoL I always find the notion of threats in a online game such as this amusing.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, Jaedan, I'm sorry Umoja and the Shriners dicked you over for a pod. However, kiting a mob around does not give you a right to the mob. If you had a reasonable force there (read: more then yourself) we would have graciously given the mob to you for sure.<br>

Venril Sathir... Who was the winner??</span><hr size=1> Mmmm Looking at these posts from a different point of View not of DG or SF but kinna third person.<br>
<br>
      What SF DID do when they joined the rotation or before l should say they let there intentions to do VS be known in advance to doing them. They didnt just race to VS and wax him they did let people on the rotation know. And furthermore which some posts relay in there messages the rotation exsists so there isn't a FFA uber mob rush. lmagine the flames that would be on this board on a weekly basis if Da`kor, MS, SF and Umoja all just raced to get people and to the spawns they needed as fast as they could?<br>
They would all be steping all over each others toes. The fact of the matter is alot of people are wondering if your willing to even work with a rotation after the way VS went down the other day.<br>
<br>
     That's what Destian l think meant in his early post about consideration. He wasn't (l think) saying you didn't have the right to kill VS ever, but at least you could have said, hey Destian/rimmuk/whoever were gonna give him a try that cool?  lt seems from what l've read, you knew whos turn it was on the rotation so l am wondering. Why didn't you say hey can we give it a shot rather then race to him. <br>
 <br>
     And the one last thing l am wondering is if this was your first VS and there happened to be trains. You might want to take into consideration you guys probably made up 65% of the zone population at the time.<br>

<br>
Since when am I only entitled to bring my guild to kill something?  Fortunately I have friends outside my guild, some in small guilds, some in the 'uber' guilds.  Within 5 minutes of my asking people to come help me I had MORE than enough people to get together and kill him.  I'm sorry if I can't mobilize those people as quickly as you can.  But I contacted and NOTIFIED several people in DG that I had people on the way and was met with the answer, tough luck, we're already here and forming groups.  <br>
<br>
So once again, yes, I have lost respect for a group of people that can't give me the benefit of the doubt that I had people on the way.  And you know what?  I wasn't just talking about the Faydedar incident.  I have had runins with DG in a negative light on more occasions than I care to comment on.  <br>

<br>
No it's not a rule, it's common courtesy.  And on a majority of the other servers it is accepted as an unwritten rule.  People write on the boards about druids from other guilds helping out and gathering the people necessary to help the person that is currently kiting Fay.  Unfortunately some people on our server seems to be entirely too selfish and greedy to extend a helping hand or at least a small amount of courtesy to let me have my shot.  As I said, I could have gotten the people together to take him out, just not as fast as DG swarmed in.<br>

<br>
I never claimed to be CAMPING Faydedar.  Show me one place where I have.  How can you camp a random spawn on a 36 hours swinging timer?  I simply set up my mule and wait for him to die.  If I am the first one to find Fay and begin kiting him I start gathering people to come kill him.  As for how long it takes me to get my people together, that's my concern, not yours.  At least do me the courtesy of letting me get them.  <br>
<br>
As for your comment of 'seemingly failing this every time' how the fuck do you know?  I wrote ONE complaint about Fay prior to this and that was because of a legitimate gripe over how the looting was handled.  And if you bothered to read that thread, people admitted to what went on.  <br>

This time I finally had enough of the DG bullshit and jumped on a growing bandwagon of people that have no respect for a guild you left.  I had people that would have come to help me but I wasn't going to waste their time while DG refused to acknowledge me and the fact I had people on the way.  <br>
<br>
Pyra, you have no IDEA what you are talking about here.  By now people know I don't come bitching here without good reason.  <br>

Pyra, my hatred for DG began building up a long time ago.  It wasn't just this one incident it was a long list of little pokes and jabs.  Again, stop creating fiction for your own mind to justify how great you think the  inconsiderate group of people you once belonged to really are.  I never claimed to camp Fay.  When DG entered the zone en masse, I first informed them in OOC that fay was spoken for and that I had people were on the way.  And I did the same in tells with Scoppie and Nocturne.(You all should know by now I always have logging on, want me to post my logs?)<br>
<br>
It was DG that chose to ignore that, it was DG that decided their right to Faydedar was greater than mine.  So fuck you and fuck Divine Grace.  <br>

LOL.  Okay, so my word that people on the way isn't enough and I should show no anger towards this guild?  You and DG CHOSE not to listen to me.<br>

And as for Umoja and the Shriners, Jengo admitted and apologized for what went on.  I have a lot more respect for them than I do you.  At least they are human.<br>

Venril Sathir... Who was the winner??</span><hr size=1> I think the biggest issue is we were led to believe that DG did not care about the rotation or even being a part of it. This caused a lot of anger because no one (and I mean NO ONE) wants a return to the old days when it was &quot;Race to the Uber-mob&quot;. A rotation helps everyone and lessens bad feelings amongst the top guilds. When some of our folks spoke with some of the DG there I believe they were told DG didn't give a damn about the rotation and considered VS a FFA mob. Since I was not there due to RL concerns I can't say exactly what was said but that was the gist of what I heard later in guildsay.<br>
<br>
If you guys want a spot in the rotation I don't think anyone would be continuing this rant. I used to be in DG way back when and from what I remember of the folks there I trust you can see that joining the rotation will be a benefit to us all, instead of all these pissing contests. As far as Trak, I don't think there would be a problem with you taking a few shots at him and joining the rotation if you succeed. Right now all he is good for is the teeth since the cleric BP nerf anyway.<br>
<br>
As far as what happened between us and Da'kor, it was a misunderstanding which was apologized profusely for. We all had the impression that we had been given the shot when in fact we hadn't. But we apologized and did the right thing, so I don't think those of you who wish to point that out can compare it to this situation. <br>
<br>
I'll end with 3 points.<br>
<br>
1. Kudo's to DG for taking VS down.<br>
2. This has been an attempt at a reasonable post, not a flame, so please do not take it as such.<br>
3. Hiya Pyra, haven't seen you since you helped me and that pally camp Ghoulbane. Nice seeing you again, even if it was just a post =) <br>

Sorry we stole *your* VS, Storm's.  I'm sure it will be repaid.  And i know for a fact we have, on several occasions, asked/informed of our intention to try VS and it worked out before.  <br>

Umoja got a shot at trak, we got it worked out and we got the try they got back later. You went in said &quot;fuck the rotation, we got here first so lets kill VS and care nothing about the rest of the guilds on the server.&quot; <br>

It has always been our plan to prove ourselves and then ask once we could do it. At least this was my understanding. I have been talking to Arnwolf about the rotation when the rotation was just Dakor and MS. I guess maybe some people thought we needed to prove we can do it before we come asking for something we dont know we can do. <br>
<br>
For the most part we are just trying to defend what we see as an attack on our family.<br>
<br>
And it seems to me that Jaeden just feels like this is her chance to stir things up more. <br>
<br>
We didn't rush to VS we all camped there the day before. It wasnt a secret that we were trying no one said don't tell your friends they just said camp in DL. <br>
<br>
I am sorry we hurt your feelings stepped on your toes perhaps the rotation guilds need to work out a standerd for how people work thier way onto the rotation. Post it here somewhere with contact people. This isn't a new thing and it isn't going to fade away. Perhaps set a limit of like 2 hours for a new guild to try when the server comes up. We all know most new guilds fail alot.<br>
<br>
I have lots of old friends in all 3 of the major guilds people I wouldn't hesitate to call family. I hate to think my guild has hurt or upset people I care about.<br>
<br>
I hope we can all move past this and find a new stronger friendship in the future.<br>
