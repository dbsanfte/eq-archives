He offered to sell my brother a weapon on a sale or return basis with a deposit involved. My brother paid the deposit but as per terms of the agreement he brings it back the next day in return for his deposit.<br>
<br>
Kelmot then proceeds to scream to the entire zone not to trade with Gerran and then logs.<br>
<br>
This happened several times until we got a message from a GM ordering Gerran to give the item back. Apparantly Kelmot had sent choice clips of the conversation to Verant. Nowhere in his log that he sent are the parts referring to paying the money back if the item isnt satisfactory.<br>
<br>
I immeditely took over the conversation as my brother is in his early teens and is IMO vulnerable to scammers. I told the GM I had logged the conversation and would send the log to Verant.<br>
<br>
The GMs dropped the case and told me they would warn Kelmot. Kelmot continued to harrass him and once again I push Gerran off the keyboard and begin to log, taking screenshots of the stuff before I sat down. In this log he swears several times to a minor who really shouldnt be hearing the foul language that issued from him and went as far as calling him a scammer. Not as bad as swearing I admit but cheeky considering that according to the GM he has been warned several times for scamming other players. He was given a second warning and the next should be his last.<br>
<br>
Be very careful what dealings you have with him as he logs what he wants and deletes the bits he doesnt. If you deal with him you may get scammed and end up looking like the bad guy. And thats worse then taking someones FBSS if you ask me.<br>

It seems your brother did not tell you the enitre story (by the way last week he did agree it was more his fault and asked me to join his guild as an officer.. go figure).  This is what happened -- He asked me if he could buy a 2h Lam from me but only pay me 100p &quot;now&quot; and pay me the rest the following day.  I said no problem... but DAYS passed before i saw him again, and when i did... no payment.  I still told him, &quot;no rush.&quot;  Now maybe that was my fault but by saying &quot;no rush&quot; I did not mean two months.  Finally I could not take it anymore and asked for my payment, he told me that he didnt have it, but i could have the sword back.  I was so frustrated that I told him to keep it and I put him on &quot;ignore.&quot;  Now if I am the scammer... how come he's still got the sword and I only got 100p for it??  Now honestly, who got scammed?<br>
And by the way... you are a complete liar..I have never been contacted by a GM or guide about anything negative, and anyone who has ever &quot;met&quot; my character knows &quot;me&quot; to be very helpful.. quite the opposite of how you described me.  I am not angry with your brother but I am pretty pissed at you simply because you're a liar.  Get all the facts clown boy and stop making stuff up like I logged after shouting gerran scammed me.  I didnt log, all I did was put your brother on ignore.  And I only shouted it once.  By the way gerran tells me you're pretty pissed at him over some plat he owes you. For future reference, if you have something to me all you have to do is type &quot;/t kelmot (topic)&quot; ... its that simple.  I know the only reason you made this post was because you thought i would never find out about it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/7/01 2:57:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kelmot</span><hr size=1> An email from Kelmot arrived in my inbox the other day forwarded through Ezboard.

<br>
Get your facts straight before you bad mouth me.  I used to live in england, and you and your brothers actions are so different from the polite people I met during my stay there.  Talk to your brother and get the whole story clown boy<br>
<br>
The subject was LIAR.<br>
<br>
Gerrans young and you tried to take advantage of that fact. He apologized because he didnt want to offend you and you were bad mouthing him as you just did me. <br>
<br>
Why he offered you an officership is beyond me but I can only think he did to make the peace.<br>
<br>
Oh and Kelmot...I did have the facts because it was me sat behind the keyboard the other night when you were doing all your swearing to a 14 yr old boy.<br>
<br>
Logs are being posted soon as I get chance to access his computer again...screenshots will go along with them to validate it all.<br>
<br>
Oh and Kelmot...Im changing my settings in the ezboard control panel so you cant send anything more to me. And can anyone tell me who his guildleader is please?<br>
<br>
I dont care of you hear it, I directed all my complaints to you in tell.<br>

Ive never written on these boards before because I wanted to avoid this but my friend told me about this and I had to.<br>
<br>
Kelmot asked me for a teloport for his group about 3 months ago. I teleported him and his group for 100pp. He told me he was meeting some friends in Kelethin to go on a raid and I would get paid when I got there. Seeing as I was waiting for a revive I agreed. When we arrived Kelmot either went linkdead or camped. Anyway I asked his group if they had it and they told me they didnt know anything about payment. So I let it be thinking I had lost my money.<br>
<br>
About 2 days later I saw Kelmot and asked him for the money. He told me he didn't owe me anything. I sent him a number of tells after which he started calling me a bitch and was extremely obscene. He swore many times going into vulgar details about where I could stick my 100pp. He told me I could stick it up my c*nt cos thats all I was getting up there.<br>
<br>
I immediately did a /report and a /petition and about 20 mins later Guide Adrealea appeared. She asked me what had gone on but Kelmot had petitioned saying he was being harrased by some woman and apologized for being nasty to her but he was provoked.<br>
<br>
Adrealea agreed that no matter what had been said before Kelmot had gone too far and would be warned for his behaviour but if the logs were to show that I had provoked him I would be warned also. I knew I hadn't done anything wrong so I wasn't bothered. I didn't hear anything more.<br>
<br>
Kelmot as I said to you at the time your pathetic. I hope you get banned. If that constitutes harrasment then so be it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/8/01 7:38:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kelmot</span><hr size=1> Nice....really nice.<br>
<br>
What the GM said at the time was that there had been many occasions where you had been warned and that you would be again. If the guide didn't do that its only testament to the fact that some guides tell lies to avoid naffing off the player base, not the testament you were telling the truth. Kelmot was as abusive, if not more so with Gerran, then he was with Aoelrona. The report went in and so did the petition and the screenshots. This looks to be at least your second occasion of abusiveness linked with some scam or other so if your not banned or at least suspended Ill be e-mailing Verant to ask why.<br>
