The mighty Elven city of Kelethin.   It is a Beautiful place where all the people of the trees live in harmony with each other and the glorious forest that is their home.  From far off can be heard the sounds of children playing and the radiating sounds blessed of music echoing through the trees.  Most there live in peace with few cares...the people are friendly and the forest provides all that anyone could long for...but it is not always that way...<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not far away lurks the dark city of the Crushbone Orcs...a filthy race of heathens that care nothing of civil life and only live to destroy and take what they see to have as their own.  The foul stench of these creatures can be smelt from far off and the stories of missing travelers and lost children are cause for every Elf to be wary.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One day many years ago on a night calm and silent the elders gathered around the wise man of Kelethin.  All that had been summoned knew that there must be trouble on the horizon for the urgent message that had gone out to call then together was a first and the blank ominous look that graced the ancient mans face was comfort to no one who now looked upon it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My friends,”,  his voice was cold as ice as he began, “there is a message in the air that hangs still in the night.  It is a warning from the trees that a dark force is growing and means us no fair will.”  He took a breath and the pain it caused him was evident and felt by everyone who were hanging on his words now.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The Orcs are on the move and there is more...they bring with them a Dark Force the likes of which we have not seen in many years.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “HA!”, a voice exploded into the silence from the back of the room, Oredous Oakspirit stood his arms crossed in front of him in defiance, ”My men are equal to any challenge those Heathens can throw at us.  Let the High Guards of Kelethin have at them...they will fall before us just like they always have.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Though he stood there with all the confidence of a giant, silence settled on the room again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No,” the wise man said quietly, “I’m afraid that this might be bigger than you and the guards combined.  This is a force more than just a man with a sword of a Magician with a few dark spells to cast...This is the power of Evil itself...I am afraid for all our sakes.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Immediately trackers and druids were sent out to survey what the Orcs were planning and the reports they returned chilled most everyone who heard them, all but the stubborn Captain of the guards who mounted his men into armor and readied for battle with little concern for what lay ahead.  Reports came in of hundreds of Orcs growing in strength and number at the forest edge all preparing for a battle that the city of Kelethin would never forget.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All the children of the city were put inside their huts and the doors guarded by the young Elves who could not stand in the front lines and in the hopes that the warring would not reach so far into the city that they would have to see battle at all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In one hut sat a young child of the name Vvell, he was son of the captain of the guard even at this young age knew that what was about to happen was going to endanger the entire city and though he had asked his father to be put to use he was told that a child of his age could do little against such a powerful foe.  So there he sat on his bed in, the hut were he and his father had lived, watching the door and contemplating a rusty long sword sitting in the corner that his father had used in his youth for the training that made him the Warrior that he was today.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As dusk fell over the Greater Faydark the usual sounds of the forest at night could not be heard, the animals that normally rose at night lay still in their dens, each one knowing that the movement the forest this evening made this a poor night to be out hunting their prey.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sounds came across the forest floor of the movement of the Orc forces forward toward the city and so were the forces of the Kelethin guard mobilized to meet the battle on even ground. The mighty bards stood just behind them and sang their songs to support and encourage their warriors into the battle and in the back were the High Elf casters and magicians who chanted and casted spells to strengthen the Warriors and immobilize the enemy.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two forces washed across the battle field and crashed together like mighty waves. The battle cries and anguished calls of the first of the mighty warriors on both sides met their fate and fall on the forest floor echoed under the canopy so far that even in his hut young Vvell stirred and cringed that the thought of what the people of his home were facing now and the thought that his father was at the front lines in the midst of the peril.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sat quietly on his bed listening to the sounds of battle, sword clashing against sword and armor and the songs of the bards sounding like they had never sounded before and the buzzing and exploding of spells cast across the oncoming Orc forces .The fifteen minutes that he sat there seemed to drag on forever but then something different happened.  He heard the  whistling sound of dozens of arrows flying through the air and the thud of each one as it landed on the outside of his hut and the surrounding area some even piercing the walls to show blacken heads inside.  With that he leaped to his feet and his fathers sword was in his hand as if it had always meant to be there.  He flipped open the lock that held the door closed from the inside and poked his head out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It first thing he saw was that the dozens of arrows surrounding the hut were in flames and the wood of the village was smouldering and blackening under them, Then as he turned his head to the other side he saw his first casualty of the battle.  The young man who had been charged with guarding his hut had been struck by dozens arrows and killed before he ever had the chances to react and now sat in a lump on the cold boards of the city platform.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He flew from the burning hut and ran to the lift that would take him down to the forest floor with no concern for the danger that lay ahead only knowing that he was going to serve some use in this fight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As got to the lift he could see that all gears and pulleys that usually made it rise and fall had been disabled seemingly to keep the Orcs from gaining access to the city and the children that sat above.  He barely even stopped to notice it before he tossed his fathers sword over the side to the grass beneath and grabbed a vine and swung in a huge circle to the bottom as he had hundreds of times in childish play.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He landed right next to his sword and grabbed it pulling it from it’s sheath and holding it high ready for any early attack that might find him even here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Many trees were blazing and the flames seemed to reach up to the sky, smoke blocking out the stars themselves.  He knew just where to go for the sounds of battle roared from ahead and drew him on.  He ran in a straight line for the sound that grew with each step until he could see the warriors and their back up fighting and falling to the ground.  The battle was clearly even to a child unskilled in the strategies of war that the battle was going well for the Elves but before a smile could grace his face with a thud there was an Orc in front of him.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Easily twice his size and with a sword almost as large the young boy was only blessed with speed to avoid it’s crushing blow as it fell beside him.  Again the sword was raised into the air and brought down but this time as he jumped to the side he swung his own sword forward and this time when the Orc’s sword hit the ground it was no longer held by a hand.  The young Warriors sword had pierced the skin of the Orc’s throat and blood now flowed from at as he slid to his knees and dropped a the foot of a huge elm tree.<br>
<br>
Pulling his sword away he moved forward and raced to the battle field and yet another Orc met destiny at the blade wielded with speed of a child and the fury of a mighty veteran.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As he moved forward and stopped at the top of a hill still behind the bulk of the battle he looked ahead to the mouth of the Crushbone city.  He was the first to see what came forward from it...there was an Orc who though smaller than many that were there, seemed to radiate strength and at his side was a being that seemed in many respects to appear like an Elf but who was dark as the night sky and had hair white as the clouds.  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just then came a mighty battle cry from just below the entrance that brought his gaze down to see his father wounded but fighting still with the fury of  mighty bear.   Orc after Orc was falling at his feet and he didn’t even stop to be sure they were dead before moving on to the next.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His father didn’t notice this dark stranger who was joining the battle and with only a strange black dagger in his hand and with each step he seemed to strike down another of the Elven warriors, each step he was closer to his father.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vvell ran into the battle climbing over the bodies of Orcs and the Elves that once he knew and called friends.  Strike after lightning strike the child was able to wound and disable the Orcs but before he reached his fathers side he saw that his father had noticed the dark man and now had him engaged in a desperate dual to the death.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They were both doing well and it seemed as he came close to his father that he might win over this demon and as the Dark one fell to one knee.  His father lifted his mighty blade and the flames lit it up for it’s final blow.  Suddenly a cry came out in support of his father from just a few feet away.  “DADDY!”  But rather than encouragement his fathers head whipped around in amazement to see his son, his sword still raised high in the air Oredous stopped in an mid swing...a Dagger driven into his chest by the dark man that now had a evilly pleased grin pulled across his face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His father fell in what seemed to be slow motion movement and as he fell landing right on top of Vvell...and after that...darkness...<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When he awoke the battle was over...He lay in a hut high in the city covered in blood.  I girl he had only met once cleaning his wounds and removing the bloody clothes that hung in him now.  As she pulled back the tunic from his chest and started to clean the blood from him there was one large stain that would not leave...his Fathers blood that had poured from the wound caused by the dagger in his Heart.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That stain never left him...and when he was old enough and started to train in the ways of the warrior he would often stop to look at the stain and contemplate revenge on the Dark Elf for the damage he did to the city and the loss that would haunt this young one all his life.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.showMessage?topicID=21.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><< Prev Topic</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.showMessage?topicID=14.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic><IMG SRC=http://acinternet.com/lanys/addReply.gif border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.emailToFriend?topicID=15.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/images/email.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Email This To a Friend"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Email This To a Friend</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.threadControl?topicID=15.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=eqasylumgeneral>General<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm25>Raid Discussions<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion>The Tavern <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire>The Merchant's Union<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself>Biographies <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumplayerrunquestsorganizeandfindactorsfordynamicquests>Player Run Quests <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumlookingforgroupannounceplanorjoinraidsandgroups>Looking for group!!!! <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumthehallofhonour>The Hall of Honour<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm24>Community Polls<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues>Rants and Raves <OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm30>Gone for good... maybe<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm26>Guildleaders' Forum<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumfrm28>Admin Use Only<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumbard>Bard<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumcleric>Cleric<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumdruid>Druid<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumenchanter>Enchanter<OPTION VALUE=eqasylummagician>Magician<OPTION VALUE=eqasylummonk>Monk<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumnecromancer>Necromancer<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumpaladin>Paladin<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumranger>Ranger<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumrogue>Rogue<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumshadowknight>Shadowknight<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumshaman>Shaman<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumwarrior>Warrior<OPTION VALUE=eqasylumwizard>Wizard</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Lanys Community Forum</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Biographies </FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033> - </FONT><A HREF=http://www.lanys.com><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Lanys.com</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033> - </FONT></B></CENTER><font size="1" face="sans-serif">There is an alternative forum for Lanys players, called <b>Free Lanys</b>.
