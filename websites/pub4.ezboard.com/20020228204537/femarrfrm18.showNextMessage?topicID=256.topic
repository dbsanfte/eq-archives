.....has been reserved for a few select people on this message board, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Let me preface this by stating a few things first.  Those who make generalizations, deserve physical and emotional harm.  They don't deserve death, I don't think, but they certainly deserve pain.  I don't think we, on earth, are responsible to provide this.  The hate you shed now, is the hate you will endure when your special room in hell is prepared for you.<br>
<br>
Level of torture in hell.  I imagine 10 levels of torture.  The higher, the more pain.  The higher, the closer your room is to the big boss.  As to show a comparison, all will be decided based on the number-one contender for a fiery life after death.  Osama Bin-Laden.  He scores a 10.  He gets a special place with the big-man.  He gets special treatment down in hell, and his screams will be heard throughout the netherworld.  All other murderers receive a 9 hell-block rating, and those government officials involved in harboring Bin-Laden also get special reservations for this elite status of 9.<br>
<br>
As far as people here are concerned, the first nominee is:<br>
<br>
<b>Justicia Crystalwind</b><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Several dozen neutron bombs. Oh nice, oil fields. thx for your buildings.<br>
<br>
Fucking people on TV celebrating? All dead. Middle east with a big mother fucking American Flag on it and <b>all Middle Eastern races completely wiped out. Dead.</b><br>
<br>
What we need to do is nuke Afghanistan all to hell. I mean <b>kill everyone there, the kids, the old people, EVERYONE. Eliminate the entire culture</b> so that kind of bullshit doesn't happen again.</font color><br>
<br>
When she is chosen by natural selection to die, I imagine she will be sent to hell-block level 8.  The type of pain she will endure will most likely include, but will not necessarily be exclusive to:<br>
<br>
Horrific Visions<br>
Continuous Rape<br>
Severe beatings with blunt objects<br>
Various cutting and slicing<br>
Extremely severe and ruthless pain by the elements.<br>
<br>
She will most likely endure this for eternity, or until all bigotry and racism is drained from her soul.  At that point, she may be lucky to be reduced to possibly a level 7, or level 6 hell-block.<br>
<br>
I don't hate you Justicia, I think you are misguided.  I feel sorry for you and the pain-warrant you are signing with every racist remark you make.  In your mind, out your mouth, on the internet.  This pain will make the pain you suffered at the hands of the uber guilds in late 1999 look like the greatest moment in your life.<br>
<br>
I feel very sorry for you.  Perhaps it isn't too late for you to change.  Perhaps it is.<br>
<br>
Next nominee:<br>
<br>
<b>Damorn Fateseeker</b><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>i am saying <b>kill them all</b>..<br>
<br>
that is all thx you~ ^_^;; </font color><br>
<br>
I feel very upset to inform that this person will probably be sent to level 6 hell-block.  The type of pain he will endure will most likely include, but will not necessarily be exclusive to:<br>
<br>
Extreme pain by the elements<br>
Horrific visions<br>
Severe beatings<br>
<br>
I feel that Damorn has a strong chance to change his fate, by realizing that generalization is very wrong, and is as hurtful to some people almost as much as bloody murder.  Perhaps he will change his views, and avoid hell altogether.  I certainly hope so.<br>
<br>
Next nominee:<br>
<br>
<b>Vendrix Muk</b><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Call me callous, call me evil, but those <b>children need to meet a swift and untimely demise</b> at the same time their heroes do. These aren't ‘innocent’ children we’re talking about, these are kids that are taught to hate Americans from the age of comprehension on. When our children are going to school and learning Algebra, these kids are learning to fire an AK-47. These are kids that are, at this very moment, thinking to themselves that when they grow up they want to crash a bigger plane into a bigger building and one-up the zealots of Tuesday’s attack. I'm sorry, or maybe I'm not, but these aren't children… they’re weapons. </font color><br>
<br>
This poor soul will probably be given to the wardens in charge of hell-block 5.  The type of pain he will endure will most likely include, but will not necessarily be exclusive to:<br>
<br>
Horrific Visions<br>
Continuous beatings<br>
Severe Pain by the elements<br>
<br>
Vendrix has possibly stated something strategic, and may indeed carry a point.  Unfortunately, regardless of the points involved, wishing children dead is all it takes to reach level 4 or 5 of hell.  This saddens me, as it seems as if he has good points on a serious level, but lacks the maturity to realize that those too young to comprehend our world now, do not deserve death.  Perhaps Vendrix will understand this, soon enough not to be sent to the fiery depths of hell.  I certainly hope so.<br>
<br>
Next nominee:<br>
<br>
<b>Sigonia Eve</b><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Screw them all...<b>genocide</b> may be the only way to fix this problem. </font color><br>
<br>
This person will meet the demons of hell-block level 5.  The type of pain he will endure will most likely include, but will not necessarily be exclusive to:<br>
<br>
Horrific Visions<br>
Continuous beatings<br>
Severe pain by the elements<br>
<br>
He will be locked away in the same chambers shared by those who wished for genocide in World War II, against the Jews.  I imagine that these people may also get special torture done to them, from my understanding very similar to what was done to Jews.  This can include pain by gas, and extra special elemental pain by fire.  Genocide, and thoughts of Genocide are severely frowned upon in hell, rightfully so.<br>
<br>
Next Nominee:<br>
<br>
<b>Straahd</b><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Kill em all, let Allah sort em out. </font color><br>
<br>
This sap will most likely be given hell-block 5 status.  The type of pain he will endure will most likely include, but will not necessarily be exclusive to:<br>
<br>
Horrific Visions<br>
Continuous beatings<br>
Severe pain by the elements<br>
<br>
A disturbing fact in the above comment made by Straahd, is the fact that he, and many many others, believe Allah is a different God.  Allah is arabic, for God.  It is saying God in a different language, and Allah is not a different God.  Christians, Jews, and Muslims all believe in Allah.  Not just Muslims.<br>
<br>
Putting that aside, its clearly obvious that Straahd wishes for Genocide, and I imagine he will be dealt with accordingly when he meets his demise and is sent straight down to burning hell.<br>
<br>
Next nominee:<br>
<br>
<b>Cibola Stratocaster</b><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>That is why <b>a complete genocide must take place</b> in those terrorist countries. Take them all out and scorch the land in such a way that is unlivable for a 100 years.</font color><br>
<br>
Cibola will most likely be rewarded with a level 7 hell-block rating.  The type of pain this person will endure will most likely include, but will not necessarily be exclusive to:<br>
<br>
Rape<br>
Extreme pain by the elements<br>
Various cutting and slicing<br>
Horrific Visions<br>
Severe beatings with blunt objects<br>
<br>
Cibola's generalization will certainly sign a one-way ticket to a burning eternity.  Family I have in southern Iran are currently grieving the deaths in New York.  They love humanity as a whole, and they have never wished death on any.  I don't hate you, Cibola, however I do feel that you have hell to pay for your generalization, and I believe that you will pay this hell.  My family has done nothing wrong, and you just wished for their death.  I don't wish for your death, I only feel that you will be severely punished by torture when you are naturally chosen to die.  Very sad indeed that you have to be this way, it won't be healthy for you in the afterlife.<br>
<br>
Next nominee:<br>
<br>
<b>Poppen Steelfist</b><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Men, women, <b>children</b> and elderly supporters of bin Laden or Afganistan should be prepared to die for their cause since they were willing to support an act of war against us..and now its time to pay. </font color><br>
<br>
Poppen would receive the go ahead for a level 4 hell-block incarceration.  The type of pain he will endure will most likely include, but will not necessarily be exclusive to:<br>
<br>
Horrific Visions<br>
Continuous beatings<br>
Severe Pain by the elements<br>
<br>
Poppen made a mistake of grouping children with Bin-Laden supporters.  Children are not mature enough to think for themselves, regardless what their surroundings are.  Wishing death upon children is barbaric, and I believe that because of this, you would be punished by the above activities.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I feel I should explain my stance, in light of what I have expressed above.  I am American.  I was born in America.  All it takes, to be American, is to be born here.  That's it.  This is a country a little over 200 years old.  Ethnicity?  There is no American 'ethnicity.'  You are of European, Middle Eastern, African, etc...descent.  There is no American descent, other then for Native Americans.  Perhaps 10,000 years from now, there will be American descent.  However, not now.  This is a country made up of all other countries.  I don't care who you are, how patriotic you think you are, or who you lost in New York.  You CANNOT generalize others in the world.  Personally, those who are bigots, those who are racists, and those who generalize get a special place in hell.<br>
<br>
What I stated above, was not meant to be because I an asshole.  I am deeply hurt that our country, America, was attacked.  I am nearly equally deeply hurt that suddenly people of middle-eastern descent, and those in other countries who also feel this was a tragedy, are being targted by selfish, ignorant, and downright stupid American people.  The above people are not patriotic.  They are barbarians.  As I have said, it takes only to be born here to be American, but the above people...they would be the absolutely lowest caste in America if we had a caste system.  The people above would be those whom would live on the streets, if I was president.  Those people above would be the beggars, they would be the garbage and filth of the United States.<br>
<br>
The above people don't represent the United States, they represent demonic hatred.  Their time of hate is now, but when they die, their time of hate is finished....and retribution for their hatred will begin.<br>
<br>
Those who wish for genocide, who wish for children to be killed, whatever country they are in, deserve this punishment.  This includes Americans, Afghanis, Iranians, middle-eastern people, Israeli people, German people, English people, Indian people, Australians.....everybody.<br>
<br>
Racial cleansing will destroy the world, not make America stronger.<br>
<br>
The percentage of scum in America, in which some of them are showcased above in this post, deserve nothing that all normal Americans have received.<br>
<br>
You don't deserve freedom.  You don't deserve America.  You deserve torturous hell.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In conclusion, let me say that people are given the opportunity, in this lifetime, to change.  Change your beliefs about genocide, about racism, and terrorism will cease.  This goes for all races, countries, colors, and people.  The above people, open your mind and realize that you are indeed, wrong.  I am truly sorry, but that is the case.<br>
<br>
Realize you are wrong, take a different stance, and avoid the fiery hells below.  Lets be human.<br>

Sure tempers and anger is flaring, but thats to be expected, some have lost family to this senseless act, anger is expected of some.  Did those few you mentioned go and kill anyone? No, they are angry, unlike you they express their sadness and anger over this event differently then you and others, this is harmless talk, people exxpressing emotion, trying to get through these times any way they know how.  For you to come here and say these things is hurtful and down right insane, how dare you wish this on your fellows...Get off your righteous high horse and join the rest of your americans in mourning...stop daming us to hell.. <p>Tanvarin Bladestorm

I can't believe you are judging people because of what they post on the fuckin EMARR BOARDS!  Wanna know something...when this all happened...the first thing I did was get a relief program started with my local college and Springfield, MO.  We have already raised over 2,000 dollars just from the campus donations.  We have gotten at least 10 different functions that will be going on in Springfield to include Car Washes, sales...stuff like that...ALL TO BENEFIT THE FAMILIES OF THE DECEASED.

What is not understandable is the obvious premeditation that went into your post.<br>

This presents a few interesting questions then, Miblis.<br>
<br>
At what point do you draw the line of 'child', and 'adult'?  When they hit 12?  13 years of age?  If I support killing every male over the age of 13 that is in opposition to the US in the middle east, am I now no longer securing for myself a place in hell, simply because now I'm not wishing the death of 'innocent children'?<br>
<br>
Perhaps while they are 13-16 they are 'semi-innocent', therefore I'm only securing my place in levels 1-3 of hell, but once they reach 17+, then all's well that end's well?<br>
<br>
Wrong bud.  Children are a product of society, just like their parents were a product of society.  What do you suggest?  Should we just kill all the adults that fight against us, and leave all their children without parents &amp; maybe take them to the united states where they'll wind up in some minority community as they get older, with little education, a job at mcdonalds, living in a group home the way many mexican immigrants do now?  The only difference will be that now we've got immigrants raising communities of their own people who, from the beginning, were taught to hate america, were basically kidnapped by america after america killed their parents, and are now being forced to live in america.<br>
<br>
There is a problem, and it needs a solution.  I don't like the idea of killing anyone, if there can be a peaceful way to remove the angst these people have against us, great.  The problem here is exactly what Vendrix stated.  These children are taught to hate america from the time they can understand words, they constantly see violence all around them, and everytime someone they know dies from any of this violence, people tell them 'its because of the americans'.  How do you expect to rehabilitate these children who've so thoroughly had the idea that america is the 'head of the snake' since they were young?  Children who've been taught violence since they could hold a blunt object?  The answer: you don't.<br>

.....I have not generalized anyone.  So whoever random person above stated that I generalized, you need to read my post word for word.<br>
<br>
I made a remark about 7 or 8 people on these boards, who have nothing constructive to say, other then all people, even those not associated with terrorism, in the middle east should die.<br>
<br>
This sickens me.  It sickened me to the point that I decided to post something for them to think about.<br>
<br>
You don't have to kill someone to go to hell.  You can wish for people to die to go to hell as well.<br>
<br>
Oh, and another thing, did I say I back up the terrorists?  Nope, as a matter of fact, I went ahead and disrespected Bin Laden BEFORE I touched on any of the local people on these boards.<br>
<br>
I am American, and damn proud of it.  I don't have to wipe out races to be patriotic, and frankly, those people who have the nerve to mention genocide, no matter what shock value has set in, don't have the right to generalize and not get any heat back.<br>
<br>
You want to wish for random innocent people to die?  Fine, go for it.  You will also be condemned, much like terrorism in the world today.<br>
