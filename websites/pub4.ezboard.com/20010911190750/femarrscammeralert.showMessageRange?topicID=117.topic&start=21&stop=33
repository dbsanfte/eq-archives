Have no affiliation to Crackie what-so-ever other than he is in MY guild.  I do NOT side with my members just because they are in my guild.  I believe in honor and I believe that members of Legion of Fate MUST be honorable or they will NOT be members anymore.  IF Crackie's account was suspended temporarily, I am sure that the FBSS will be returned to it's rightful owner when it is no longer suspended. I will even request that Crackie hand it to me so that I can return it unless you and he want to settle it yourselves.<br>
<br>
I am not going to get into who is at fault here, but my intention is to make sure that the issue is resolved between all parties.<br>
<br>
As to the rest of this thread, it has broken down like so many threads into a virtual mud slinging contest.  I have found that most of the time, the issue can be resolved very easily most of the time without this, but many feel it necessary to massage their own egos.<br>
<br>
Parum, I know how you feel.  But the problem with a &quot;witch hunt&quot; is often the innocent (and I am not saying anyone in this issue is innocent) often get caught in the crossfire as well.  I have ran across this type of issue several times and have always been able to resolve it by discussing it with the person's guild leaders or officers.  I have found that virtually all guilds on EMarr try to make sure that it's members are honorable and will take actions when necessary, up to and including kicking out of the guild. In fact, I know of several members who became &quot;guildless&quot; all of the sudden because of an issue I have brought up to a guild leader when my members brought it to my attention.  I feel this is, afterall, a responsibility that a guild leadership should shoulder, however unpleasant it may be.<br>

caiell, crackie, slazzer, and infernal..2 ive guilded with, the other 2 im friends with<br>
<br>
i know who crackie is, and i know his old main as well....if this is true crackie (refuses the urge to use his other name out of habit lol) then whats up man? just give it back and let it be done hehe<br>
<br>
the crackie i know, as the other char, i remember when you won the FBSS, and we were talking about it and you let me borrow it, we were in our 40s, so it was a pretty exciting thing, and seeing how at that time i had never experienced item haste, a pretty big risk<br>
<br>
so why would someone that was an asshole and a stealer trust someone else (at the time we didnt know each other really well)? most shady people dont put trust in others hehe<br>
<br>
and about the runed cowl, are they lore? b/c last i remember crackie already had a runed cowl, mr. 200 int at lvl 30 lol<br>
<br>
well im done. maybe its the wrong person hehe<br>

Remember, it happenned at lguk on Emarr, not another server, yes its true. =p<br>
<br>
Ryched, if you are reading this, and if your are saying that Naguk and Foxxer were NOT in that group, then I will know what kind of person you are.<br>
<br>
Aaah so someone is a friend of Infernal, then you will know what kind of a guild Moment of Clarity is. So ask that former guild leader if its true that he still cannot believe how trustworthy I am? Remind him on who passed his FBSS to the barb rogue at OT. =p<br>
<br>
I have a lot in my mind, things that are too ugly to say, and Hipp, those words will destroy your guild reputation fast, as they are ugly indeed, on how I had been so badly treated by your guild caused of this episode.<br>
<br>
I still repeat this, I am THE victim!<br>
<br>
Giving you an example on how bad it is - A burglar broke into my home, I manage to overpower him, hand him to the police, he was jailed for a week. All those time, he manage to contact his friends, and they come in hordes to harrass me and tried to make my life unbearable. In a week time, that burglar will be free and in his mind, there is only one thing, revenge! <br>
<br>
See the problem here? I never wanted this hostility, I never want that burglar as my enemy, its him who forced his way into my life, that used to be a bliss. Well, he got punished caused of me, but if he never done anything wrong, why would he? Oh yeah, I am to be blame, cause I have that big house that is just too inviting to be broke into. Get the point? We can NEVER win.<br>
<br>
I think I should be in hiding mode for an indefinite time, so that the burglar cant find my family and will switch to another target and maybe forget about me. =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=crakiepipe>crakiepipe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/15/01 12:54:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bah</span><hr size=1> Waawi, Naguk and Foxxer were not in group.

<br>
I'd like to know who said what as well...I tend to be a rather errrr Verbal while I'm upset, and I've managed to stay out of it, till now.  Of course it worries me when a guild member has been accused of unfair dealings, but I also like to know the facts surrounding a situation.  Crackie came out RIGHT away and stated in guild and on our message board what he percieved of what happened.  I do also like to believe in my guildmates, and up till now I have not seen an unkind or unmorale word spoken/typed of Crackie.<br>
<br>
It &quot;seems&quot; to me to be an issue that should have been resolved between you and crackie.  An item dropped, and was rolled on, I still do not understand why it took you so long to roll....there's a lot of &quot;I went LD&quot; and &quot;He went LD&quot; going around...so it's okay if you go ld or don't think about rolling for 10 min or so?  That does seem the consensus.  As the item is returned, and I'm sure to eleviate the issue if crackie hadn't seen to it, or verant hadn't seen it returned....the officers in LoF would have.<br>
<br>
Issue settled for now...we will be watching ALL those involved.  However, we'd still like to know who's &quot;hunting you/your family down&quot;.  That type of behavior is easily stopped. <p><Center><IMG SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/belgar.jpg"><BR><IT>

<br>
I didn't go LD before the roll.  What I saw was we were rolling for the FBSS.  Sometime during the rolling Waawi said he was experencing some lag.  After all the rolling (but Waawi's) was done, Crackie turned out to have won.  By 2 or more mins later, Waawi's roll appeared and beat Crackie.  And right about then did I go LD.  When I came back I only saw Waawi, myself and 1 other in the &quot;group&quot; (I got back in).  I asked what had happend and someone told me they went LD like myself.  It took me a good couple of minutes to get back on so I don't know what happend between me LDing and when I came back on.  When I talked with Crackie (who was on Jayfu, his bro's monk) did I learn that he actually had been banned and so forth, athough I remember Waawi and others in OOC talking of such actions.<br>
<br>
oh and 1 more thing<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The exception to this was the cleric had not yet rolled. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I remember Waawi stating he did roll (in grp chat) but he was getting a lot of lag.  <br>
<br>
Also, Waawi, did you ever consider that perhaps you couldn't see the [LD] due to the wall?  I know some enchanters like to sit in a corner or whereever to med and you can't usually see their whole name due to the name clipping into the walls.  Just food for thought, nothing more.<br>
