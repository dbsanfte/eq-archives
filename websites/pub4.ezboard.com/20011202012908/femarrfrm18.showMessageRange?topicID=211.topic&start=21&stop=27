Okay, now back to the last post. Where does the US walk away to? Space? The other side of the planet? Where do we leave the drunkards*Taliban* to rant at someone else? Where do we go to? <br>

<br>
We didn't have to bomb the Taliban. All we had to do was wait after we cut off their food supply.  It's pretty simple fuedal politics: No food because of government, eventually government gets overthrown.  The new government would be required to hand over Bin Laden, or at least allow troops to come find him, and only when the government acedes this will the food flow again.  Bombing them, like i said, just pisses them off more...<br>

Who knows what would have happened, or what will?  What our government is doing now is the quickest and surefire way to bring evil to justice.<br>
<br>
Also, there is a small hole in your logic.  We say we're bombing because of the Talbian not the Afghani people... if we cut off food because of the Talbian, it will have the same effect.  &quot;the US isn't giving us food&quot; or &quot;the US is blowing up our government&quot; ... however you put it someone is going to be upset.  I never said it would be pretty.  I just said as long as things continue how they have been, ther will never be peace. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufeathersilverthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feather Silverthorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/17/01 12:29:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okay</span><hr size=1> Hmm Solve this with sanctions. And Blockades......<br>
<br>
What do you think we have been doing. Why do you think the terrorists hate us so much. <br>
<br>
We do not recognize the Taliban as the government in Afganistan. They have had sanctions. And They attacked.<br>
<br>
They have declared a Jihad against All americans.  ALL of us. The little 6 month old who has Anthrax. (I think it is 6 months old) Think that the baby hates Muslims... NO.<br>
<br>
Mail covered in spores. And you want to blockade? Give me a fucking break. Planes crashing into buildings and you want to sanction. Fuck that.<br>
<br>
We drop food to the starving people of Afganistan. and the Talbain take it from them. The strong feeding over the weak. <br>
<br>
Who will be hurt more with Sanctions. Think the Talbain are going to starve before the people with no guns starve? Wrong. Take what the people have and feed themselves are more likely. All while telling them (At gunpoint) that the dirty Evil great satan is behind all of it. <br>
<br>
If they tell them enough. And with enough force. With no opposing views. And no education to refute it. Then guess what. They belive it. <br>
<br>
Want to do some good in the world. Kill anyone in Afganistan that supports the Taliban. Kill any of the people that Bitch about us being over there. Then Round up the few remaining people give them food. Build them new homes. Hand them the keys and get the fuck out. Check on them now and again. Make sure they havent fallen victim to some hate monger. If they have remind them what america is about. <br>
<br>
An Eagle.  In one claw a Dove with an olive branch. In the other. Arrows.  Arrows designed to KILL.  Not sanction. Not blockade. Kill.<br>
<br>
Human nature hasnt changed much from Caveman days. We are cleaner. We have fancy numbers, We dabble in ethics, and morality. But in the end it always comes down to force. <br>
<br>
We can't ask them to leave us alone. We have to MAKE them leave us alone.<br>
That is going to take force. That is going to take blood. Thiers and ours. It is going to take pain and suffering. On both sides. It is going to take many many tears. On both sides.<br>
<br>
So Be it.<br>
<br>
Amercia is a nation of ugly brutish beasts. We act nice most of the time. We dance and entertain the world with or fractured sense of morality and shame. We build ourselves up to great heights, then tear ourselves down. Then we look at what and how it happened and do it over again. Better this time. But in the End we are still beasts. Poke us one to many times and we will rip a hole over the thin covering of civility and kill you. We may feel sorry about it later. We will help clean up the mess and pain of it afterword. But you will still be dead for poking us wrong. And remember we did not poke first.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the right thing to do... freakin HIT BACK!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
(yes, I've twisted your words by leaving stuff out). I disagree with what you say is the &quot;right thing to do&quot; when dealing with an abusive drunkard. You didn't take the opportunity to avoid the fight. There's a heroin junkie who lives on the main street in the last suburb I lived in. He usually yells abuse at everyone walking past, and has been known to spit at people. In my opinion the right thing to do is not to stand there and then get involved in a fight, it's to ignore him.<br>
<br>
If I'd stopped my comment there and not tied it to current events, it might have stood as a better argument. My disagreement with your suggested behaviour towards drunkards was what prompted my response.<br>
<br>
But then I went on to relate the idea to current events, and like all analogies, it's liable to break down. I'll try to explain. To walk away would have been to butt out of the Middle East. But that's too late now. The fight started long ago, and the drunkard has followed you home to continue the fight there. By refilling his bottle, I meant fuelling the fire, making the situation worse. The word &quot;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=liberal">liberally</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&quot; in that context should be read as definition 2 in M-W, probably 2b or 2c. ie the protagonist is taking a few hearty swings of the bottle him(or her) self.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the REFERENCE about the drunkard that didn't know who he is dealing with as the US being told we're gonna get destroyed by a third world country.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
To me this reads like you were trying to say that the drunkard should be interpreted as the US, but I don't think that's what you were trying to say.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/18/01 9:27:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: okay</span><hr size=1> It's not just wrong to protest against war and preach against its evils, when it is your country that has been attacked, it's incredibly stupid. Last I can re-call, your USA never wanted a war with Afghanistan, never attacked Bin Laden or caused him any wrong, and 6500+ civilians were killed - before any formal declaration of war/jihad. War is wrong and evil but c'mon who brought it on? People lecturing their fellows about non-violence and the evil of their country's war against terror? <br>
<br>
By the way there is no assumption that the war is also against your fellow citizen who just happens to be muslim  <br>
<br>
When your family is dead, all around you, and the Guppy brutally slain in its little corner of the fishtank; when you stand outside and see all around you the neighborhood is smoking in ruins; when fanatical youth gangs travel your country systematically raping your daughters because they are American/non-Islamic; when disease strikes down your children in rather deliberate circumnstances and your country says it will fight back... Do you pick up a Placard and say it is wrong to fight back? Get with the program.<br>
<br>
Going to Vietnam was wrong. Most people accept that. But this war had it coming by a long way.<br>

Americans love to fight, traditionally. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. You are here today for three reasons. First, because you are here to defend your homes and your loved ones. Second, you are here for your own self respect, because you would not want to be anywhere else. Third, you are here because you are real men and all real men like to fight. When you, here, everyone of you, were kids, you all admired the champion marble player, the fastest runner, the toughest boxer, the big league ball players, and the All-American football players. Americans love a winner. Americans will not tolerate a loser. Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win all of the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war; for the very idea of losing is hateful to an American.<br>
