I was made aware of the situation after it happened. As an officer of Dark Trinity I believe what Alnaron did was wrong.<br>
But after working closely with him over the past three months, I have concluded that Alnaron is a genuinely kind and enjoyable person and any guild should be proud to call a brother.<br>
I know not about his past. But coming to meet him with a blank slate I have developed a great deal of personal respect for him, both in the way he fights and how he interacts with others.<br>
Plainly put: It does seem to me that many people are using this as an opportunity to pillory Alnaron. To what end I do not know.<br>
Leo, in all honesty I have seen many worse things posted here which destroy fun for entire raids, kill people unnecessarily and genuinely destroy the pleasure of the game for days at a time removed from this list for failing to follow the smallest of rules or because it's not deemed worthy. <br>
I know and respect almost every person who has posted here and it puzzles me as to why this issue was not brought to my, or any other officer's, attention before dragging my guild into the melee.<br>
Although I'm unwilling to conduct guild business in public, I can assure the complaintant that the response you would have gotten from the Dark Trinity corps of officers would have been more fruitful than attacking an individual and his guild publicly.<br>
Unlike most, I'm a firm believer in the idea of one's actions reflecting positively or negatively on one's associates, including their guild and friends.<br>
Those who know me know that I choose my friends carefully.<br>
Alnaron is my friend.<br>
I am not friends with malicious players who hurt others or destroy their fun in the game. In this case, we were in PvP.<br>
We were in an exceptionally disorganized event. For his actions, Al was punished for breaking the rules of the game by the GM.<br>
The GM took special pleasure, I'm sure, in dragging his corpse around the zone. Turnabout is fair play. I would have drawn delight in the fact that Friz saw fit to play games with him the way he played games with you.<br>
I fail to see how this event reflects a greater &quot;pattern&quot; of his behavior and how referring to that pattern, such as has been presumed, provides adequate justification for what we can all see is a relatively minor rules infraction in a race war GM event.<br>
Having said that, I will say I still consider Alnaron my friend and remain extroardinarily proud of Dark Trinity and all it's members.<br>
In the name of peace, let's allow this to drop. I'm sure this has reinforced Alnaron's usually steady observance of the feelings of others.<br>

<br>
1.  I have not seen one DT member say what Al did was not wrong.  They have all said it was a dumb thing to do.  They just keep saying over and over that it could have been handled better.  <br>
<br>
2.  The only reason that they are defending him so hard in my opinion is this line right here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;And to Dark Trinity, I think you should do something about this asshole, he doesn't deserve to be in any guild regardless of the fact hes lvl 60.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I mean what kind of a thing to say is that.  What he did was dumb, but to tell a guild that because a guy in thier killed you in the arena that he shouldn't be in thier guild.  That is where you moved it from just letting everyone know what Al did to almost a slam on DT's decision making.  That I'm afraid is why you have DT people here sticking up for him so hard, because you also ripped on the whole guild.<br>
<br>
Now don't misunderstand I don't think that's what you were trying to do, but when I first read it that's the way it appeared to me, so I think it may have appeared that way to them too.<br>
<br>
That is the only reason I posted, I have never had problems with Al.  He's always been nice enough when I was in the same area as him. <p><img src=http://www.manorhouse.addr.com/sc2kbuttons/bulb53.jpg> <br>

i read the whole thing.  so a few people say it was wrong.  the point is alnaron doesn't think it was.  a -lot- of people here don't think it was (hence my 'and in your pathetic group' comment).  If you think it was, woot, then you know why this post is staying here for a bit, huh? =D<br>
<br>
it really don't matter though.  this post does have enough merit to stay for a bit, leolan agrees, that's all that's required.  why you respect his decision over mine when we're both saying the same thing is... uhh.. strange, but your choice =D<br>
<br>
peace out homey<br>
p.s. if i had a bone to pick with DT... uhhh... you'd know it ;D<br>

Guess I'm done looking at these boards.  Rules are _NOT_ meant to be used when convienent, that's why they are rules.<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with Leolan or Xian, but I think that by jumping in the mix, and &quot;adding fuel to the fire&quot; isn't the function of an administrator.  I've done it for a long time.  I'm not here to tell you how to do your job, because frankly you both have done a great job.<br>
<br>
The thing that sucks is that 2 threads above this one, you are quoting the very thing that I posted here in the first place.  That the Shit List should be a last resort.  Problems should be resolved with the person, guild, players friends, etc.<br>
<br>
Sure Alnaron has been on the Shit List quite a bit.  Does that automatically mean that anyone who has beef with him can just start posting without following the guidelines of the forum?<br>
<br>
I think the rule still needs to be enforced, Xian n' Leolan.  If the person deals with Karsys or an officer and is STILL upset with the situation, then a repost would be ideal.<br>
<br>
If the administrators/moderators can't be consistent with everyone, then the overall benefit of this forum is moot.<br>
<br>
Just something to think about.<br>
<br>
Anyway, have a great day,<br>

Xian, Karsys was also implying that you can't think for yourself. I can't seem to understand where he gathers that either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To the rest of you...here's basic truth.<br>
<br>
Alnaron only needs to be nice to his guildmates. No, if Alnaron is the kind of person who gathers fun at the expense of others, you would not want him on your raid. Alnaron has his own source of raids though, which is DT.<br>
<br>
If he has his own source for raids, you bet he does for groups too. This may not be the case all the time, but for the most part it is.<br>
<br>
Just like many other people, who have discarded with their reputation. ShitListing him achieves nothing. The only reason DT is defending him is because they were brought into this too, which they shouldn't have been.<br>
<br>
Tact, respect, civility, emotion, and maturity are wasted. A useless cause. Pathetic...but true. <br>

First off i know as a guild officer what you are saying *why didn't he contact us first*..however being that you were present for the event ..has anyone considers that maybe he felt that it was a waste of time contactiong you...please i Know alnaron well enough to know when he killed this person ...he was braggin to his group about that. Now my question to you as one guild officers to another WHY at that time did you not do/say somthing? should he have to contact you before you see the actions as being wrong ...or should you see the actions as being wrong for what they are?  now i also understand that you where busy getting your ass tagged by the UBER Elfs *woot* but you knew it happened...was anything said to Alnaron after the smoke from the fight cleared...or was the *he was wrong, he should say hes sorry* only said after this post came up?<br>
<br>
another thing i don't blame this person for still being mad...Alnaron *I'm sorry* was poor at best...someone that truely sees why they are sorry..doesn't say things that he has said..please re-read his poor excuse for a post!! <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">

But I think that most people that have dealt with Alnaron agree he's a punk.  I have had 4 dealings with him,  <br>
first one,  no problems.  Main assist on a raid I was in,  he did a great job, I respect him as one warrior to another goes, he does a great job.  <br>
2  grouped with him, had a great time,  He master looted conviently forgot about a sword that was looted when split occured,  him and kontra worked something out,  didnt really care about it cause I had won a nice item that nite in that group.  <br>
3 He came on a riders raid was rude, and said crap in ooc about several people in my guild including me and my husband.  When I said something to him back, he couldnt take it and logged,  he could dish but not take.  <br>
4 went on a DT raid he hosted.  He was obnoxious in the way he handled things,  and when it came time to leave he did not pass out money items to people that had spent money there,  IE clerics chanters ect.  and when something was said about it,  he and a couple other members of DT Start shouting and cusing to the complainers.  Calling them names, not mature imho.  But the fight was entertaining lol.<br>
<br>
Anyway its not my intention to bash Alnaron further just to let people know what most people already know that, Alnaron is a good Warrior occasional funny and good guy but over all ASS.<br>
Later all,  <br>
have fun and try to rember its just a game.  I know sometimes we all get caught up in it, and get hurt by others actions,  I have done it myself.  Just try to be good to each other and if your not,  dont get offended when the person you are messing with,  does it right back to you.<br>

<br>
True, I most certainly didn't bother talking to any DT members, considering the other lvl 60 DT member there was team killing just like Alnaron. I got the feeling most of the guild is like this.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why DT is relying so heavily on the shit list rules, when Leo and Xian are agreeing to keep this thread up.<br>
<br>
A lot of you people at first must have misread the very first post, seeing it as only your average pvp fight where a higher lvl killed a lower level. It wasn't like that at all. This was an GM pvp event I looked forward to, payed for, had a little bit of fun (thats about all I could fit within 5 minutes of being alive, a &quot;little bit&quot; of fun), and then got killed by some team killing jackass.<br>
<br>
I would've thought that a person like Alnaron, someone who dedicated months of work in order to have a lvl 60 warrior equipped with some of the finest gear in Norrath, would act like a 13 year old. It's very unfortunate people online, of all games, are like this in Everquest. I thought this was a game for intellegent people.<br>
<br>
And when asking Alnaron in tells why he did this, after all the &quot;you're a gnome&quot; crap, I did curse at him being as mad as I was, and he replied with an innocent tone that I should not use language like that. After what he did, I should be polite?<br>
<br>
If my last few posts seemed immature with overuse of the capslock key and the word &quot;fuck&quot;, please disregard those, cause I was a tad pissed.<br>
<br>
For the people who are continuing to defend Alnaron, you can keep telling me of proper shit listing etiquette and rules, but I will always consider your dear friend, Alnaron, an asshole.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

Just a quick comment for everyone who's so quick to judge our abilities by our comments (or lack thereof)...<br>
<br>
This ain't a very easy job, and it's definitely not easy (biting a hole in my tongue here) to keep quiet while people say things that you think are ridiculously inane.  It only gets worse when people are constantly acting a certain way and don't realize the impact they're making on themselves.  Should we stand by idly just because we're moderators, or should we make our feelings known?  After all, we're bound to have them, and they're just as valid as anyone else's... shrug... just some thoughts... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uplurlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PlurLanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/9/01 5:00:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 13 year old?</span><hr size=1> this should probably be on another thread <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , lemme just say that there's a way to express your feelings without taunting people to go against your decision. <p><img src=http://www.everwonder.com/david/tacobell/gallery/2.jpg>
