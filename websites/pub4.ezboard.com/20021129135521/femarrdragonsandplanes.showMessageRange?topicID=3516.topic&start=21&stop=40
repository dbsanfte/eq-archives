Do you really think the actions of one individual had some grand effect on the server as a whole, maybe in rare circumstances, but not for what this *accused* person did(and yes, I know full well who we’re talking about). Ill bet less than 5% of the server knows who this person was and of those 5% ill bet <0.5% still own any items they acquired via said individual.<br>
<br>
Do you realize that he and you are like apples and oranges? So what if he beat you to 50, got some decent caster gear first or maybe passed some out to friends(he certainly didn’t have the best caster gear, that required a group). He was a Necro and you are(were, whatever) a Monk. I can’t think of a single worthwhile item that you and he would have competed for in the Old World… Serpentine Bracers maybe? I’m also at a loss to see how his method of gaining xp ever caused you to be left out of anything. He solo’d specters, back in the day they hit like trucks… no Monks(hell, no melee at all) ever fought Specters… I know, because I was there all the time.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, Azakar and myself were the next two highest Necros on the server when this person played. If anyone were entitled to a gripe it would be one of us. You know what heinous crime ‘this person’ committed against us, he researched our spells when we got the words… what a bastard. In all my playtime not once did I ever see him exploit or even run across him at a camp I wanted to xp at. If I was the same class as him and it didn’t affect me, how the hell did it affect you?<br>
<br>
Once again you’ve put on your horse blinders and chosen to crusade against the person selling Prozac to teenagers instead of the guy selling crack to kids. There have been much(read: MUCH) bigger offenders than this person in the world of MMORPG no-no’s. Why don’t you chime in or jihad against the people that scam others in trades, steal items from people, hack characters, etc? For once, just maybe, you should let the Jaywalker go and focus your attention on the guy robbing the liquor store. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Can you site any other incidents that YOU witnessed in some way prove player S to be a cheater or exploiter or whatever label you wish to use for him/her... or is this crusade based soley on ONE incident you witnessed (which happened over 3 years ago) along with supposition and rumour??<br>

You're now doing a damn fine impression of one of those religious nutcases that we all read about in the papers now pal.<br>
<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like you're bearing a grudge against one person because of their actions from a long time ago (possibly even one incident) and crusading against something that is for all intents and purposes a moot point now anyway... why not go on a crusade against any &quot;evil&quot; historic figure that have commited crimes against humanity??

Player 'S' did to wipe out 64 people in Unrest.  I would just love to know WHY 'The Crusade' (TM ?) has come to where it is today.<br>
<br>
I have been reading these boards for several months now and it is a recurring subject and yet it is something never fully explained why??  I have been told by friends to not say something as I will just get targetted as being evil too but, damn it is bugging me!  C'mon Chiteng - spill the beans.  My curiosity is getting better of me - tell us the heinous crime committed so we can better understand the crusade (I may have played for over 3 years but even I missed this one)!<br>
<br>
Personally I have been on the end of a few nasty basement trains in Unrest back in the old days (when bronze was UBER and the werebats were to be feared!).  Heck I was even trained once or twice in Sol cos someone else wanted the Efreeti room spawn (damn never got me any booties anyway *sigh*) but I have let it go - ok maybe they got a revive when they were desperate for a res, but it was left at that.<br>

I have on occasion leveled very fast. Hell I even got 60 before Chiteng. My god I even soloed for xp as a thief in EVERY damn level (Including 59 and 60) And I am far from uber.<br>
<br>
Why am I not classified as Evil? <br>
<br>
Because I never denied Chiteng a group? <br>
<br>
Chiteng ol buddy. You are not a crusader. You do not fight eveil at every turn. Only when it directly affected you. Only when your panties got in a bunch. Only when it was someone that stood in your way or pissed you off.<br>
<br>
Mitch trained someone on purpose. She said she did it. Yet you do not revile her because of her so called Evil act.<br>
<br>
You are a hypocrit, a deluded person who is tilting at windmills, for what ever reasons you wish to pretend are important to you.<br>
<br>
You are not a crusader, fighting for the good of the commen man, for the noble persuit of an equal playing feild. You are a nut job who is persuing a grudge that is over and done with. If exploiting is found and proven it is sometimes dealt with harshly, sometimes with a warning, and sometimes laughed at and a stern talking to happens. GM's are human, not avenging angels filled with holy fire to clense the unbelivers. <br>
<br>
There is no instant replay in EQ. Suck it up. Deal with the fact that it isnt the perfect utopia, and move the @#%$ on with whatever life you had before the horrible transgression of 64 peoples death in unrest happened. <br>
<br>
In other words stop whinging about the long dead and buried past and let it GO.<br>

<br>
Your going back to the earliest days and anyone playing now who didnt play in the first 6 month to year of this game would have a hard time recognizing thier class.<br>
<br>
Back then Monks and Rogues..well...Sucked, hell rogues didnt even have a working backstab back then! There were zero weapons a monk could use that were &quot;better&quot; than thier hands. there was no &quot;epics&quot; and the top haste item was a FBSS (if you ever even saw one).<br>
 <br>
At the same time the most powerful class BY FAR was the necro. <br>
<br>
why?<br>
 <br>
Because someone discovered that if you gave your pet 2 fine steel daggers it dropped the delay on your pet from ~30 to 19...this combined with Fear ment Necros could pretty well solo anything in the game from about level 39....well anything not in a Dungeon.<br>
<br>
Another great advantage they had back then was the fact they could pull a pet, break a room of lower blues, tell the pet to Guard the room, cast FD and then go to work leaving the game running all day....pets did not poof while Necro's were FD back then, the &quot;hasted&quot; pet would have no problem keeping up with the spawn and even if it was overcome there was no danger to the player (I have a friend who went from 36 to 39 in one day while at work using this &quot;trick&quot;).<br>
<br>
Of course all these &quot;exploits&quot; were nurfed, Necros were brought down rudely from thier god status long ago (I still remember how Shocked Verant was when someone demonstrated that a necro pet WITHOUT the aid of the necro other than pet buffs and FS daggers could solo a level 50 warrior with planer weapons and armour....).<br>
<br>
Face it, there was no way a monk (with the armour and weapons available back then) could keep up to a well played soloing Necro, or Druid for that matter.<br>

<br>
Have you EVER heard me bring up this guy before? I have indeed I have.<br>
But not for over three years. If you dont wish to participate because YOU<br>
choose to feel its personal, by all means dont. You and others keep asking<br>
for others examples. You keep implying that there are none. Yet when I provide <br>
yet another example, you dont like it. I cant please you.<br>
BTW - there are no Soul Devourers in Unrest, or if there are, I havent seen them.<br>
<br>
Feldynn, Its actually quite easy, you just have to be willing to turn you mind off.<br>
You will need, A rouge level 57 with the skills of Feather(she was there in my group) a Cleric from Denmark that is insomniac, His girl freind who I really dont<br>
know how she stayed awake. You go to a specific spot, where most players do not<br>
go, because quite truthfully it is a PAIN IN THE ASS to get to. It has a very high<br>
spawn rate. And you stand in one spot, and let the druid pull the mobs to you.<br>
Fortunately Feather was more than slightly familiar with the area and she was<br>
able to both explore and pull some other stuff for us to liven up the evening.<br>
And you stand there until your arms fall off. As one player gets tired, you<br>
use the guild channel to call for a replacement. I had a count, but I am sorry<br>
I forget the number. 625 spawns? I hate being in-exact. This is also where I learned that a well prepared rouge can tank better than a poorly prepared<br>
monk.<br>
<br>
<br>
Smilin, I really wish I knew. I know what I saw, and at the time Remdar was a freind<br>
and he gave me HIS opinion. But nothing in the game can explain it.<br>
To tell you more would be to finger a specific person. That isnt the intent of the <br>
thread. I am sorry. But yes he did or he helped cause a monumental train<br>
There were 104 people in Unrest, 64 died in the train.<br>
If I had not been 'paranoiac' and I have a habit, of ALWAYS being FD when I am not<br>
actually fighting or pulling. Just in case the unforseen happens, I would have easily<br>
died also. To this day, that dick has refused to explain what happened.<br>
But trust me, he has been asked, by me, many times. But you see, he isnt<br>
accountable to some lowly monk. Or anyone else. 'We' are lucky if he even<br>
acknowledges us. Explanations are for losers you see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ice I will do you even one better It happened at 9:32 pm EST. Find him and ask him. I am certain he remembers. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

Oh I know he soloed specters but I used all that Karma up on another player.<br>
<br>
Can you Vendrix, state before the entire forum, that you NEVER saw that guy<br>
exploit?. Even if you could, you were not there from the start, and you certainly<br>
were NOT in Unrest on day 26.<br>
<br>
You see Vendrix, ALOT of people reached level 50 before me. Its HOW they reached<br>
level 50 that matters. Do you see me pissed at Oggie? Naru?<br>
Would that not make sence IF it were class envy? Naru for all his faults<br>
which in my opinion are many, is a proud man. He would never cheat. It is beneath him. He may make a mistake and kill 40 guildies on PoF, but he would not cheat.<br>
Nor is Naru an abusive player. Player 'S' is and was.<br>
<br>
I didnt see you down in Lguk with him and Remdar and Haruna pharming<br>
the eye. <br>
<br>
IF you did see him cheat, you cant afford to admit it here. He is your guild mate.<br>

<br>
1)  I clearly said IF &lt;-- keyword there.   IF  this is going to be a personal vendetta conversation about a specific person (and we all know who that is) then yeah I am done.   IF &lt;-- keyword there.   IF this is goign to be a conversation about abusive players, exploiting etc,  then fine.   You can use individual people all you want,  just making sure the motives behind their use is all.<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
2)  There are no soul devourers in unrest.   I realize that,  trust me I do.    The problem there was it was late, I was tired,  you had mentioned an issue in unrest then a following comment about a soul devourer.  That was my error since it SEEMED to be in the same vein,  I actually thought you had mispoken and was just keeping in topic =)<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway...  It still doesnt change the fact that the profile you put up is not the profile of an abusive player.  It is in fact the profile of a GOOD player.  You did give one example of an bonafied exploit, the rest wasn't quite exploit material.  I am completely curious where your perception of out of control exploitation comes from however.  <br>
<br>
Something else to consider is, and I have seen this a LOT, there is a FINE FINE line between creative use of skills and exploitation.  WHen I say FINE,  I do mean FINE, MINISCULE, however that also doesnt change the fact that until VI deems it an exploit.  It is not an exploit. Some examples of this..... (these were all accused of being exploitations at one time or another)<br>
<br>
Fear Kiting<br>
Quad Kiting<br>
Kiting<br>
FD Spawn Splitting<br>
Mem Blur powerleveling<br>
Dying to be dragged to a dangerous camp<br>
<br>
These are just some examples of things that while I have heard folks say is a cheating/exploiting, or I have been asked to deal with people doing this,  they were not.  Actually quad kiting was almost considered an exploit but they never sealed it and then decided it wasn't.<br>
<br>
I can also give you a VERY long list of things that were exploits, and how they were dealt with.<br>
<br>
So,  this is tryign to keep on topic. . exploiting/abusive players and your crusade to end them.<br>
<br>
I have to run now, daughter needs help with Zoo Tycoon (rediculously silly game, but oddly fun )<br>

For someone to argue FOR player 'S' he must show me that he is neither. Something that will be hard to do.<br>
<br>
He didnt just hand out goodies and say 'come whorship me'<br>
<br>
He had a good deal more finess than that. It was more like:<br>
<br>
Hi, my name is &quot;S', yes I am sure you have heard people accuse me of exploiting and cheating, but it isnt true! I swear! Look at my equipment, If I was gonna exploit dont you think I would do better than this crap? I am really a nice guy<br>
once you get to know me. Give me a chance man, those guys are all just losers<br>
and wannabees, you dont want to be like that, right? Lets go give Vox a go eh?<br>
<br>
His new freinds never see him exploit, because he doesnt NOW. He has no need.<br>
So they fight with righteous outrage in his defence. WE have never seen him cheat!<br>
I dont doubt that at all. That doesnt mean he never has however. It also doesnt<br>
mean he isnt abusive. They fight his fight for him, with all the vigor of the righteous. 'Damn 'S' is a straight up guy! He soloed Vox for 20 rounds when we all got feared! What a man!'<br>
<br>
The truth lies forgotten in the dirt. And he wins.  <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

There is an exploit when you zone from Swamp of no hope While levitateing, you hug the left most zone wall then you can walk beoynd the borders and fall off the end of the world.<br>
<br>
This teleports you to the bridge of Fir vie.  EXPLOIT!<br>
<br>
I used the Worm hole in West karanas a few times. EXPLOIT!<br>
<br>
I dropped off the bridge in Paw alot with my level 12 mage before the revamp and started to camp before I hit the water, to camp out before the gnolls could reach me with the shoddy pathing. (Pet trains = Bad)<br>
<br>
I spent a day 2 and a half years ago Figguring out how to aggro a blue necro pet without aggroing the Necro himself (Who was red) who would then send his pet to attack every 30 seconds for close to 5 hours. EXPLOIT! (Of course I almost died every fight but I was technicly exploiting)<br>
<br>
I snuck through a fully popped Hate nekkid and alone (Except for Loredana who ported me up) to steal the book of souls from under the maestros chin. (Not the intended way to get it. so you guessed it EXPLOIT!) (God damn that was fun)<br>
<br>
I could tank as a thief. (Certainly not intended) EXPLOIT<br>
<br>
I can still tank as a shaman (Wheeeee) EXPLOIT!<br>
<br>
I could pull a fully popped room singly as a thief in howling stones as a level 55 thief. (Sneakpull rocks) EXPLOIT!<br>
<br>
I could solo as a thief. (Inconceiveable!) Exploit!<br>
<br>
Some of them are exploits. Some are bugs that worked to my advantage sometimes, some were just smart playing.<br>
<br>
There is a fine line between all of them. Relax, laugh at yourself being a dumbass for three years holding onto things that in the great scheme of things have less import than a gnats balls, and Let it go.<br>
<br>
Please for our sanity and what is left of yours. Laugh, and let it go.<br>

No you don't.  If you did you'd be crusading against 10's maybe 100's of players past and present on Emarr not to mention other servers.  If you were consistantly crusading against such players on Emarr then the chances are you'd probably get more backing / support from the community than you do right now (assuming you have any to start with).<br>

How can you be so certain he was exploiting back then??  There are many legitimate ways to accomplish seemingly outlandish things if you are willing to think outside the box (and thinking outside the box doesn't mean getting a monster stuck somewhere it can't hit you) <p><center>--------<center>
