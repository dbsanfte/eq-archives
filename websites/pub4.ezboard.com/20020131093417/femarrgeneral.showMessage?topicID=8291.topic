On-board graphics?</span><hr size=1> Ok, what in the hell are on-board graphics. I assume it means the technology is actually built onto the card, and doesn't have an actual card that plugs into it's slot. At least, that's what I'm interpreting.<br>
<br>
I scrape up the cash, and get a graphics card. My computer is 2X AGP, as is this card, 2x/4xAGP 32MB ATI Radeon. But, whenever I take off the cover of the PC, I don't see a damn AGP slot, but 3 PCI slots. <br>
<br>
So, I look it up, and it says that to disable this particular motherboards on-board display, it has auto-detect, without any jumpers. WTF does that mean? Does that mean if I plug in another video card, it will automatically default to that? Or, does it mean something far more cumbersome and tiring? I think I know the answer..<br>
<br>
Also, where do I plug the card in? Will it go in a PCI slot, or is there something I'm missing, or am I just royally fucked? I haven't opened up the actual bag containing the video card, but....damn you Emachines. Damn you.<br>
<br>
Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.<br>

Sorry, you will not be upgrading that machine with any agp card. Which means you are really stuck since the only recent cards that were made PCI were 3dfx VooDoo and Geforce 2 MX series.<br>

<br>
Ok, so what I'm gonna do is take back that card in the morning. Since I didn't actually open the sleeve, please tell me they'll take it back. I got it at Office Depot, so please tell me they'll take it back, or I'll implode into a ball of fiery death.<br>
<br>
I'm going to go beat my head into a wall now. And for your info, no I didn't buy a Emachines, but it's what I have available. I despise this crappy ass system.<br>
<br>
EDIT: What about the Radeon 32MB SDR PCI card? It appears to be the same card, sans the graphic port locale. Any info?<br>
<br>
Thanks again Celdor,<br>

On-board graphics?</span><hr size=1> Hmm, thats one on me, didn't know ati had a radeon pci. Yes, office depot should take it back, its not like software. Just tell them you found it was incompatible. The issue with the Radeon is that until they get it fixed, any Radeon card will make it so you see through your head while fighting. The model moves but the viewpoint doesn't. Until it is clear whether it will or even can be fixed I couldn't recommend ATI unless you plan on not enabling the new graphics for your race. I would suggest any GeForce2 MX400, here is a list of models and prices you can find online <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.pricewatch.com/1/37/3230-1.htm">www.pricewatch.com/1/37/3230-1.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> .<br>
<br>
It's a decent card and can do pretty much all the Radeon can, just the 2d graphics on text outside of games is not as sharp (really doesn't matter unless you have your desktop set at 1600x1200 or higher). <br>
<br>
One tip on the computer, I wasn't kidding about the fan. If it starts to get loud, get with your warranty company. The fans go out very easily and cause the power supply to short and also may cause motherboard damage. It's a very common issue due to the low quality/very small size power supplies they put in those systems. <p><br><br><center><img src=http://home.austin.rr.com/mav1973/sig3.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukidin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kidin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/10/02 1:57:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8291.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bah, what in the hell! On-board graphics?</span><hr size=1> I have a crappy e-machine.<br>
Now serves as a gaming/educational computer for MY KIDS.<br>
(SMALL KIDS - Plays Pretty little Pony &amp; Winnie the Pooh fine)<br>
<br>
It used to play EQ before the expansions.<br>
It Played Kunark badly and SOV horribly.<br>
<br>
So I upgraded it.  Hard to do w/ an emachine.  But I managed.<br>
The extra ram helped.  (Easy)<br>
The video card was a bit tougher.  (I'm not a computer tech)<br>
<br>
E-machine tech support was HORRIBLE.  I was given completely INCORRECT advice.  It took 5 e-mails back and forth before they finally even admitted they had given me wrong advice.  (Not that I got anything out of that, except personal satisfaction.)  Yes, NO AGP.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    The onboard video was 4mb, very lame.  I don't know jack about bios, but I did have to disable the onboard video by changing the jumper settings.  Guess what?  The picture that came w/ the e-machine of the guts of the hunk of junk was WRONG, as was the webpage for my model.  <br>
<br>
I figured it out eventually.  It took awhile longer than I expected.  Deep breathing and a few beers (after the physical install was done) prevented me from tossing it out my front window.  (I had just bought new windows (3K US$) on my house - which may have been the only thing that kept me from doing that.) After countless restarts, driver installs, and throwing chicken bones on the floor, it finally worked right.  Was more than capable of handling SOV at that point.<br>
(500Mhz Celeron, 192Meg of SDRAM, &amp; the PCI bus ATI XPERT128 16Meg video card)  Zone times about 20secs.<br>
<br>
ATI does make that PCI bus 32Meg card, don't remember the model.  Check the used section of any computer store and maybe you'll get lucky.  I think hardly anyone makes them now.<br>
<br>
SOL forced me to get a new machine.<br>
Up to you if you can live w/ your head being semi-transparent during combat on the moon.<br>

Take care,<br>

Thing is AGP stands for Advanced Graphics Port. Technically to market a AGP without a port is false advertising.<br>

Elsa do a GeForce II PCI card although you really could use a serious upgrade to your machine. A new motherboard and 512MB RAM would really improve your play. A lot. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Major kudo's to you. Thorkin, do you have an addy for that site? I did a quick search through compaq.com, but wasn't able to locate it, although I didn't look too hard.<br>
<br>
Also, IS Emachines part of Compaq? I think their seperate, but I'm unsure and think that any site explaining it might help. Celdor wanna comment on this? *bats his eyelashes* Hey, your a bard, you swing that way right? 8===D O:<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks much. This is greatly appreciated.<br>

AGP = 66 Mhz bus<br>
<br>
You can have onboard AGP graphics without a AGP slot by placing the video adapter chip directly on the motherboard.  Generally the onboard video is crappy 8 Mb junk useful only for secretaries and wimps.<br>
<br>
There are typically three ways to turn off onboard video:<br>
1) auto detect (this usually requires an AGP slot)<br>
2) BIOS<br>
3) Jumper<br>
<br>
To upgrade from onboard video to PCI:<br>
1) In display properties set the video adapter to standard PCI VGA<br>
2) In add/remove programs uninstall any associated video software.<br>
3) Power down, set the jumper and install the new PCI card.<br>
4) Fire it up and install the PCI card according to the instructions. <p>Tordor 56th Dwarven Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalamarndarkgem>Dalamarn Darkgem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/11/02 6:04:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8291.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: On board Vid cards</span><hr size=1> I have a similar problem, my IBM has onboard AGP but no AGP slot.  Go to www.pricewatch.com.  Click on video cards, for about $57 you should be able to get a geforce 2 400mx 64 meg pci video card.  This is an awesome site to check the ongoing price on parts.  Many times at only 1/2 or 1/3 of the price you'll pay in stores.  It goes out and polls different places to bring you the best prices available, and shows you the increase or decrease in price day to day.  Hope this helps.<br>
