in the coding that is the standardized MAX you can be hasted at level 60 at 50 and below your best haste you can POSSIBLY get is 50% these are known facts not disputed across every single server<br>second <br>players claims you van get 100% haste or more at 60 nope sorry go to a fan faire and you will be laughed out of the building by every single programmer there ive seen it done at San diego and alot of my friends saw it at the other fan faires here is the formula for haste there are other things like checks for haste lag effect things like that but this is the BASIC program of how Haste with a weapon works follow along even if you think im full of crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>we will use Wurmslayer as a Basis<br>25/40 wurmslayer base<br>25/21 at level 49 with max possible haste 50%<br>25/12 Max level 60 haste &lt;yes i know bard song breaks cap and such but 12 delay is DAMN low as it is&gt;<br>&lt;Philagradom happened to be the person clocked and stopwatched on a PoG raid for confirmation&gt;<br>Haste is a easy format it is simply Weapon delay wurms for example 40 &lt;times&gt; the max possible haste at level 49 &lt;50% ish&gt; as a percentage = new delay of weapon this = 20/21 delay <br>some people say this doesnt work becuase max speed is 10 delay well that was put into the figure before hand and the last 10 delay is figured in new delay if anyone has ever coded in Basic they understand the line<br>x times .&lt;decimal point&gt; y =z if   z = less then 10 make z 10 roughl;y thats the line &lt;been 12 years since i even seen basic bare with me&gt; that is how haste works according to verant ... now some people say they hav parsed things based on the files they found in their computer by hacking the files well it doesnt take a genius to realize those files are bogus your character is only saved on your computer as a set of options so you cant POSSIBLY hack a file on your computer and test from it if it doesnt exist its all on the Server Parsing programs are 90% bull they are based from idiots who think they are cool for hacking purposely misleading files that have no connection to the game of eq heh haha shame on us verant laf POS's <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i dont like the idea of putting crap on my computer that isnt useful either pissed me off for a good 2 years then i decided hell with it its a game enjoy it as such<br><br>ok Second thing<br>Damage per second and Speed aggro WTF who comes up with this crap DPS alone is a bogus idea its based on the fact that you hit 100% of all hits that NEVER HAPPENS unless your level 60 beating down a guard in commons with my haste note above Philagradom the warrior who i watched clocked and talked to about his choice of weps WUrm and Lammy at the time i asked him if there wasa noticable diff in speed when he was hasted &lt;shaman or enchanter spell forgot who was on the raid with us i just rtemember dying about 12 times to help recover everyones corpses&gt; he said Not really both swung at about 1 second intervals and i stopwatched Lammy at 10 delay average &lt;sometimes slower lag&gt; and Wurm at 1.1 - 1.3 at slowest &lt;not including lag&gt; but i Digress from DPS DPS is based on 100% hit accuracy so as a figure it is worthless <br>and following it is idiotic base your choice of wep on your personal style damage or speed its that simple leave it that way<br>Last on my rants &lt;heh first time ive posted something like this since eq was made heh sorry for the long windedness&gt; Speed aggro again NO SUCH THING well in a way there is but isnt its not speed its simply the damage to a Mob lets use a guildie of mine Cuukey as a namebass here Cuukey is wailing on lets say Venril Sathir Cuukey has been wailin on Venril a while and has hit venril for a total of 1600 damage in a short ammount of time this makes Cuukey the Prime person taking aggro <br>cuukey hits for 60-90 max per hit nad at the moment hits fast enough so casters and slow weapon users without his speed level dont pull aggro this is something we ALL know <br>Now the Raid with Ostap Jaledar Forlador and Moeman we had in kael Jaledar and Forlador both speed wep users haste items buffs ect were the MA and SA both past 50 dont know what Jale had but Forla had Lsoee and Frostbringer good weps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and then we have Moeman the relatively untwinked level 45 war with Wurmslaer and shimmering Particsan during the ENTIRE run through kael we had Moeman 95% of the time had ALL the aggro and me as a druid overnuking wouldnt pull the mob off him he was hitting for 150+ average per hit per weapon vs the 40-100 forla was htting for max <br>Moaman also was critting in the 350+ range OFTEN &lt;Go Moe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &gt; moe had only haste speed buff maybe a fbss but when i see things like that and Philagradom onm a PoG raid using these slow weapons that &quot;Dont taunt as well&quot; getting their arses handed to them because they ARE taunting well &lt;btw moeman NEVER touched his taunt button&gt; this makes me wonder how the HECK do people say Speed aggro is best i mean in that case a Wizard casting a Solist wich does like 1200 damage i think casting it often of COURSE he is gonna take aggro if people use these low damage taunt weps ive been on raids over the years when kunark was new EVERYONE used Wurm when they could grab one and nukers were safe becuase the damag output of 15 warriors with Wurmslayer and some other slow wep or even a Lammy at the time ,rare as all hell back then&gt; would keep a wizard safe they could overnuke till their Robe exploded from all the mana being burned the mob wouldnt even notice they existed I remember one of the first Raids on Smiley on veeshan &lt;Smiley is the old nickname for Trakanon btw&gt; FoH at the time the warriors with epic &lt;the few&gt; and everyone else had the highest damage thing they could swing hell i saw like 8 Barb warriors toting weighted axes it was insane by todays standards of calm calculated raids of today &lt;well mostly calculated&gt; anyone who was on Stilettos recent raid on trakanon remembers turning the corner LONG before we got to bridge and seeing Smiley RIGHT there in front of us heh i believe Stiletto or someone else said OH FOOK and i looked  up saw smiley and thought ..... yup we dead not buffed not ready and he is grinning at the buffet before him heh yes we all died but in the end Smiley died we won 2 Cobalt bps dropped &lt;on top of the like 3+ other cobalt items that day&gt;<br>it was a good day heh Stiletto lead a fun raid anyhow its like 5am took me 4 hours to come up with this as close to understandable to even me heh im going to bed this isnt a flame this isnt a you are all stupid for thinkin this way this is for information purposes only and debate and discussion enjoy <br><br>PS when usiong a tet to type program to post never leave the tv on and go outside for a smoke i had more then half the lines from Pitch black on my screen &lt;YIKES&gt;

Wich brings the weapon to around 1.5 per swing or 15dly.<br><br>also btw your body is to slow to use a stopwatch and get exact times causes human errors so thats a stupid way to try and do something when its coming down to half secs and whatnot since its impossible for you to do.<br><br><br>with my dps statement i forgot to put in the fact that the person is hasted to max haste 100% wich brings the weapon to 10dly or 1 swing per second. Monk hits for 99 dmg with 15dmg weapon. average hit being around 70 so you would say 70dps?<br><br>to figure out dps take total dmg you did for a 1 min period of time and divide it by 60 this will give you your dps.<br> <p><img border="0" src="http://falcor81.future.easyspace.com/sig001.gif" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrukoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trukoflanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 8:05:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1700.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Haste DPS ect&lt;according to verant&gt;</span><hr size=1> its a very well known fact you can get dly bellow 10dly. look at standard its 10dly to start if you haste you get more swings per min. wich you can check in logs and count by hand. <p><img border="0" src="http://falcor81.future.easyspace.com/sig001.gif" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrukoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trukoflanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 8:11:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1700.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Haste DPS ect&lt;according to verant&gt;</span><hr size=1> also acording to what your saying wurm slayer would be msot powerfull weapon in game. if your getting it to 12dly.<br><br>25/12 wurm<br>14/10 epic<br><br>so your saying all warriors who do epic quest are wasting time and should just get a wurm slayer since its apprently best weapon in game according to your info. wich it is not. <p><img border="0" src="http://falcor81.future.easyspace.com/sig001.gif" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucelesteawildrose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celestea Wildrose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 8:34:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1700.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kayleechen.homestead.com/files/bouncie2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Haste DPS ect&lt;according to verant&gt;</span><hr size=1> &lt;extends the hand out attempting to calm Truk down&gt;<br>&lt;takes out a novelty sledgehammer and beats the poor person senseless who started this thread and continues to argue about something they know nothing about...&gt;<br> <p><br><img src="http://jalenyawns.homestead.com/files/sig1.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukultharsavus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KultharSavus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 8:51:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1700.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Haste DPS ect&lt;according to verant&gt;</span><hr size=1> I'm supposed to be using a wurmslayer?
