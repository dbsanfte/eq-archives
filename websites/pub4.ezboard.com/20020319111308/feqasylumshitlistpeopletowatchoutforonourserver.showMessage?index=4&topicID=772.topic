<br>
But I do have something to add to this.<br>
<br>
After I heard about this I told a few of my friends about him, ect, so that his reputation would obviously be shattered by dawn tomorrow.  Anyway, I was on my Necromancer, Brenil sitting and chatting with another fellow necro friend in Neriak, I went afk for about an hour, then came back and scrolled through my messages.  To my surpise, Snifer had sent me a tell, how long ago I don't know.  But out of the blue he said, &quot;Can you sac me? 250pp for each EE&quot;  this was AFTER the fact of what happened to Korani, but since I was afk I didn't say anything to him.  Anyway, when I got back I tried to send him a tell (a not so good one), but he wasn't on.  <br>
<br>
I told my necro friend who was still next to me in Neriak, about the tell he sent me and how funny it was that he was gonna sac himself after scamming Korani, real class act.  What's even funnier, is he also sent HER a tell asking her to sac him too.  So apparently he was very desprite to delevel as his reputation was now shot.  My friend having heard what happened to Korani and knew this guy's name and rep by now, replyed with &quot;Being sacced to avoid a bad reputation hmm?&quot;<br>
<br>
Snifer told her &quot;No, I am quiting and I want to sac my character and sell all my stuff to give to my friends&quot;... a likely story, his friends probably equal several twinks.  Anyway, my friend then told him &quot;Or maybe it's because you stole a certain book for a poor Pally and you're trying to restart before you get caught.&quot;   She said a minute later, Snifer was gone... poof like the wind.  <br>
<br>
This shithead is obviously in a scamming mood, whether or not he's actually quitting I dunno, I do know he's trying to make alot of money all the wrong ways, stay away from this bag of shit.<br>

My hubby spammed him with TLs, but he refused them all.  Luckily, he decided to leave shortly after that.  We had a great raid that day, except for him.  I've seen him around begging me for ports since then, I've ignored every request of his.  I'm not surprised he did this crap to you... he seemed quite the little jerk when I met him.<br>

He has been using Vita's name to gain the trust of people in these various scams, just want to say now that he was deguilded previous to this incedent. <br>
<br>
BTW, just to add more to the pile of shit, Snifer basically ninja'd that book from a Vita raid. After we deguilded him, when we asked for the book back he said, &quot;I'm not in the guild so I can only give it to the only guildbank I have, me&quot; or something to that effect.

<br>
Goes LD comes back and we give em another chance...this time he does 100% better he doesnt yell for heals etc he pulls well...totally diff person...<br>
<br>
Then we're in kitchen again and we notice this druid sitting in the room with us...I believe it was the druid mentioned earlier...and snifer told us he was being played by him earlier before he logged on (which was when he went LD the time before)...<br>
<br>
Dunno if this means anything but i really think whoever the real snifer is made a bad decision in letting that guy play him if it was indeed two people.<br>

One of my guildmates was in the group when Korani got screwed, and I got to read those logs too.<br>
<br>
When we next caught up with him, he'd gone from 57 to 50, and I presume he's still falling.  Since he appears to have more than one character available, I guess he's not really gone -- just going to appear under a different name in a month or two.<br>
<br>
I imagine Rylex will still be around to greet him when that happens.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=45407>Tranthas Stormwalker</a><br>

My fav part is when he is about to die in the duel and says STOP! LOL ohhh no stop what are you doing to me? What a fucking little pussy! He is most certainly a moron and belongs here. Rylex you rock! Glad you guys scammed the book off him. Since he wouldn't give it back to it's rightful owners (Vita) I'm glad it at least isn't being used to scam people anymore. Nice work.<br>
<br>
Everyone needs to ban him from all guilds and groups. Fuck that little shithead.<br>
<br>
BTW, he is one of the worst players I have ever had the misfortune of being around. He was on a hole raid with us recently and ran around like a 2 year old the whole time...couldn't assist AT ALL...was not paying attention...rolled NBG on a smoldering brand (yeah..like a 57 warrior &quot;needs&quot; a smoldering brand...riiiiight! He then admits to me after that he only wanted it to let a freind &quot;borrow it&quot;)...was dueling during the raid...just an all around IDIOT. <br>
<br>
He also tried to use the old excuse &quot;that was my roommate&quot; whenever something bad happened. That shit don't fly...if you let someone else play your character then be prepared to accept full responsibility for whatever they might do, including getting you on the SL. Enjoy your stay here Snifer...I think you'll be here for sometime to come. WTG fuckhead. <p><font color=9999FF size=2>
