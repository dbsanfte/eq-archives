It should be strictly between you and me.<br><br>I am a director in the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH) formerly mandated to head the committee that looked into failed, uncompleted and over-invoiced contracts in my ministry and presently the director contract payment division.<br><br>During the course of investigation it was found that the sum of US$16.5m[Sixteen million five thousand US Dollars] was issued for an over invoiced contract but this said money is in the Central Bank of Nigeria [CBN] suspense account. Owing to the policy in the country as against public servants operating foreign account and also to have that kind of huge amount in our local accounts, I am soliciting for an individual to transfer this money into his foreign account for personal investment pu <br>Note clearly that this transaction has been well planned. I have followed all the required official contract award/ payment procedures, and all documents to facilitate the smooth conclusion of this transaction are legitimate and officially in order.<br><br>There is no problem, this contract is LEGAL. THIS TRANSACTION IS A BUSINESS DEAL BETWEEN YOU AND I, BUT IT IS LEGITIMATE AND GENUINE TO THE AUTHORITIES. I want to assure you that you have nothing to fear about, your main priority should be to give me your total co-operation,<br>And follow my advice /instructions. You should consider this transaction as already successful &amp; concluded.<br><br>What is required is for me to have you registered as a foreign contractor with my ministry as category 'A' contractor for this I would require you to provide me with your company name, address and phone with fax number for the registration, it is after this has been done that I will make you the sole beneficiary of the fund and submit for payment processing to your nominated account to the relevant ministry.<br><br>Consider this transaction as successful and completed for I have taken<br>care of all modalities and official procedures involved legitimately and as required.<br><br>Note clearly that as top Government officials in Nigeria, occupying very sensitive top Government position we receive little salaries compared to our positions. Once more I want you to understand that this transaction is 100% risk free.<br><br>We will discuss the percentage to be given to you before we proceed.<br><br>Best Wishes,<br><br>Ego Tano(Engr) <br>NB: please, reply to alternative email address to, tego6@engineer.com<br>-- <br>__________________________________________________________<br>Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup">www.mail.com/?sr=signup</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzolmazzoboto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zolmaz Zo Boto</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.iconbazaar.com/flags/animated/usa/usa_3a.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 328<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/28/02 7:29:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> It is a Scam..

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 <br>is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over <br>with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever <br>come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration <br>of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the <br>Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim this fund.<br> <br>Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foriegner <br>to stand in as the next of kin to Mrs.Ann Barbara Myers so that the fruits <br>of this woman's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt <br>government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide <br>immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will <br>prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you <br>in place as the next of kin.<br>We shall employ the services of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization <br>of the WILL and to obtain the necessary <br>documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.<br><br>We would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole <br>benefactor to the inheritance of Mrs.Ann Barbara Myers to travel and claim <br>this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe which is used by <br>my bank as an offshore payment center to the bank.The money will <br>be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. <br>There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction <br>will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager <br>guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.<br><br>If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private <br>email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you <br>with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the<br>transaction. <br><br>Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this <br>transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall <br>require your assistance to invest my share in your country.<br>  <br>Awaiting your urgent reply via my email:beke@totalise.co.uk<br> <br>Thanks and regards.<br> <br>MR JONATHAN(JOHN)AUDU <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2249<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/02 3:00:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=888.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Just so you know what these people do is very often deposit large sums on money into peoples accounts just to bait the pot.<br><br>This is why so many get scammed because there are plenty of stories where it has been somewhat true.

He probably wouldnt have gotten caught except he thought he was so cool for it he decided to share his doings with another co-worker.
