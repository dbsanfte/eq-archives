<br>
Some guilds aren't well equiped, and can't do things like HoT with one group yet. Guess what it boils down to is, next time you guys go...since you've done oh so great things there is, have the balls to move into the halls and let the less equiped people have the platform.<br>
<br>
You'll actually see that getting to the named is much easier by going deep into the halls. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Kodylan Stompioras

Because the other raid can always CR us if things get messy.  I think an ideal solution to this would be that if a second raid comes in and wants to do HoT, they move deeper in and the &quot;platform&quot; raid agrees to CR them if they are wiped out.<br>
<br>
I also don't see any problem with posting it on the calendar to let other guilds know your intention.  Perhaps you should specify that you would like to hold a *platform* HoT raid and that anyone else is welcome to come and move deeper in...since a spur of the moment raid is far more likely to be equipped and experienced enough to do so. <p><center><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig7.gif" >

<br>
I posted this up here months ago, and was at the forefront of haveing HoT on the calander, but no,  everyone said keep it FFA, so we did.<br>
<br>
So we went in there, what we did not need however is the nasty tells calling us &quot;raid crushers&quot; to &quot;fooking liars&quot; because of the lack of communication from your guilds.<br>
<br>
We prob could have worked something out but those tells pissed us off, so we didnt, /shrug<br>

<br>
I got on-line and found out it was cancelled.  All I heard was that they went in, saw you guys in there and decided to call it off.

As for discussing this topic &quot;months ago&quot;..../shrug I didn't see the original message and at that time wouldn't have been able to offer an opinion one way or the other anyways as I hadn't been there yet.<br>
<br>
I guess all I'm looking for is some &quot;general rule&quot; to follow for this in the future.  If the Oboo decide to hold their first HoT raid in the next month or so would you recommend me dropping a post on your web page just to give a heads up?  Is a calendar posting enough? or are they basically SOL if someone feels like going in ahead of them?<br>

It's funny but all the people here who preach that the calendar is simply an information tool seem to forget that when it comes to Hot. <br>
<br>
All you are doing is informing peeps that you will be there. <br>
<br>
I could easily post on my guilds boards a planned hot raid then all trek over that at the set time only to find out that there's currently a raid in hot because Guild b did the same as me posted on their own boards. <br>
<br>
How else other then the calendar are you supposed to know if someones planning to be there? Visit every other Hot capable guild's boards and check their raid listings?<br>
<br>
In Addition to that Hot can support at least 2 raids. 1 Ent 1 exit. As soon as I get back from my happy little trip to Chicago I'm planning to host an exit raid.<br>
<br>
Also you need the calendar if you plan to hold an open raid so people have the ability to sign up now granted with hot it'ss not as big an issue but for other things it is. Now that Zland isn't a big deal with Visions I want to hold an open Zland raid and I plan to use the calendar to see exactly how many people are interested. Plan to with Vind as well. Granted for those I may just stick with the raid board for sign up rather then posting it on the calendar but why is it such a big deal if it goes on the calendar?<br>
<br>
I think I was the first person to throw hot on the calendar. And I copped shit over it. I planned a raid for the same day as MW. It was no biggy Azz just bumped his raid and even if he hadn't I woulda bumped mine or we would have joined together. Had I not put it on the calendar MW woulda shown up to find my raid already in progress (i think I was set for 1 hr before theirs) and they woulda had a whole bunch of people in a currently raided zone. Granted Azz and I woulda worked something out quite easily but my putting it on the calendar actually made things able to be dealt with ahead of time rather then talking in tells while I was trying to continue my raid to keep ahead of the respawn. What about if they showed up and then decided to move their raid...What about the peeps that had actually planned around this raid? Peeps do do that. I know I have. I've taken days off work for certain raids. Sure would piss me off to find out the day of that it was cancelled.<br>
<br>
Peeps go fucking gonzo at Visions for clearing fear w/o putting it on the calendar and mucking up a sched. raid yet if a Hot raid is planned on and they show up and there's already a guild raiding there it's no biggie? How is it different? Because Hot spawn is only 72 minutes? Oh yeah I see lots of raids only stay for 1 spawn. Hot raids normally last as long as a planar raid chances are good that if you have a raid planned for the same time another guild does yours will be cancelled. Yeah you can go in as soon as Guild A gets done and have stuff to kill (something that needs to be fixed planeswise) but you prolly will not have as long a raid as you planned to because by the time guild A is done and you get start peeps need to log sleep etc.<br>
<br>
Maybe my insomnia has faulted up my thinking but I just don't see any prob with it and only see it being beneficial.<br>

EDIT:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If your goal is to mass farm armor, then you want low risk, and lots of kills. The platform is the ideal spot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Gonna argue here with you Azzi. If your goal is to mass farm armor get to the exit and pull to there mobs in the back run about 87 percent drop rate and about 34 percent chance of dropping 2 or more pieces. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utanisemanasponge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanise Manasponge</A> at: 10/19/01 5:49:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utsulyrashadowhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 7:24:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1609.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> /nods<br>
<br>
I only been past the pit once on a raid.  There was already a raid on the platform.  I think we had about 2 1/2 groups at the start and went down the left hall from the pit.  Think the raid leaders talked it over and the other raid was pulling from the other hall.<br>
<br>
It went better than I thought.  Was a little spookey without the reassurance of an easy cr.  But was lots of fun.  A new angle to HoT.<br>
<br>
By the time we were done, there were 4 groups and had killed the named ones from deeper in.  Whenever we did the named critters from the platform it usually resulted in multiple deaths for the pull team trying to get them there.  But from deeper in the hall was a one shot deal and no deaths.  <br>
<br>
And when we left the other raid was still going stong on the platform.<br>
<br>
But should HoT be on the calander?  Don't know, most folks talk with each other between the pro-dragon guilds to arrange things.  Usually someone in the guild knows if someone is raiding in HoT, cause your guild clerics and melees usually get asked to go to fillout a raid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>
