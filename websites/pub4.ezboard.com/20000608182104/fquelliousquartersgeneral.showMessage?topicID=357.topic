<br>
Lower Guk was the destination, and as the dead side is getting like one of those music festivals where you can't move for tents and long haired people with 19 children then we figured we'll see what the live side has to offer.<br>
<br>
So myself, my two pets the Paladins Stannis and Kehlar, Hagruk the Cleric and the gorgeous Synjari took it upon ourselves to find out. Whilst waiting for Kehlar too arrive we thought a few easy monsters to get us into the swing of things would do, so off Stannis went into the unknown pulling to his hearts content. Soon the corpses stacked up around us and then Kehlar arrived in Upper Guk.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Kehlar has not been gifted with Ranger like skills so I had to go and retrieve him, so off I went. Halfway into Upper Guk and across groupsay Stannis is screaming GO!, Synjari is yelling expletives, and Hagruk must have been scared stiff, either that or his little legs were pumping so hard he couldn't talk hehe. After collecting Kehlar, and making it back down to the Live side it turns out that they got mobbed and Stannis perished. <br>
<br>
We went back in, resurrected the Holy man and started again, this time we started to move up the corridor and we fared pretty well, inching our way up slaying beasts as we went. Soon however word from the Froglok and Minotaur community must of got out, as  we were beating on one minotaur all of a sudden another appeared, then a couple of frogs. Soon Kehlar had fallen, and we were all running for our lives hehe. So third time lucky we think, this is not going to defeat us. All back and ready to go we decide to take a left turn this time and go to a spot I have been to before. Relatively safe once the area has been cleared.<br>
<br>
Well a minotaur took a liking to Stannis, and charged at us, we started fighting it. The frogs across the water seemed quiet enough, but a couple more wanderers decided to join in. Then a few more, then a couple more hehe till it seemed like we were being swarmed by frogs from all over. <br>
<br>
Back in North Karanas hehe, yep I had to evac, though I kept my 100% record as noone was left behind thank god! I also had the pleasure of meeting Tinglebranch, a very nice Druid who had heard of my madcap adventures from somewhere!! Then the shiny Paladin himself, Pinbin Valendral, appeared and we met him in South Ro.<br>
<br>
So now I had 3 pets, beat that necros and mages *grin*, and we took off for Guk. I foolishly had gated there as no sooner had I arrived outside the Live Side when they all shouted Ancient Cyclops!! Gah!!!<br>
They killed it and Pinbin is now the lucky owner of THE ring!! So we go back into Lower Guk and this time things go nice and smoothly, our Paladins swords were humming, and the healing was coming, whilst Synjari discovered here nuking potential and took down a few with her Druidic magic.<br>
<br>
We eventually arrived at our chosen 'spot' on the shores of a great underground lake, where rumour has it a big eye lived!&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sure enough it appeared soon, so we killed it hehe. Stannis got another magical pack to put his ill gotten gains in! Then proceeded a lot of dead frogs and minotaurs thanks to the splendid pulling power of Stannis.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Stannis was having problems with his numbers as his shouts of 'Incoming 1 frog' should really have been 'Incoming 3 frogs oh and a minotaur as well' hehe. <br>
<br>
Then came the moment that topped the whole night off, Stannis had cleared the maze completely and found the three minotaurs where it is rumoured the Patriach lives. We were all good to go, so we gave him the go ahead to pull them. This would hurt a lot as the Minos pack a real punch. So Stannis shouts 'Incoming, 3 minos', well sure enough, 3 minos came hehe then 2 more. In fact the other 2 beat Stannis to our spot, I think they wanted to get in our group and were shouting 'Incoming 1 Stannis' =)<br>
<br>
It was the most amazing fight I have ever had the pleasure of living through, we all attacked with a frenzy, and a couple of us wavered a bit as we thought this really was too much for us. I had every faith in our abilities, and sure enough soon there were 3 left then 2, then the final one fell. We all cheered at a job well done, each and everyone of us had been battered some, we had hardly any mana left it really was one of those stand or die moments and we emerged victorious!!<br>
<br>
I don't know what happened much after that as I had to camp soon after, but it was a truly great night and I shall remember that fight with the Minos for a long long time!!<br>
<br>
I look forward to awaking in Norrath for more of the same hehe!!<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

With that we said farewell to Guk, and Synjari ported us to south ro.<br>
<br>
We said our goodbye's to Synjari, and... well.. we were planning to smack a few sand giants, but there weren't any to be seen anywhere, so, next stop oasis <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>
<br>
Again nothing, so i suggested that we try the deepwater goblins, as i'd been here with some old higher level friends a while ago, and longed to return when i would perhaps be able to hold my own in a group here. The perfect opportunity, and things looked promising...<br>
<br>
We picked a spot on the water's edge, and Pinbin promptly set out, to see if he could locate a likely candidate or two. A minute or so later he shouts 'inc!', and arrives back at our goblin whacking point, closely followed by a nice little deepwater goblin, who looked more than ready to be pumelled. We all jumped on it, but oh dear, he'd brought along a friend, followed by another, and another, and another, and... hehe.<br>
<br>
I noticed that the first goblin, the one that we'd ALL been hacking away at, didn't seem to be any worse for it, and so i conned him...ack!!...blood red, along with all his mates.<br>
Obviously, this discovery was quickly followed by calls of 'zone!', and shouts of 'deepwater gob to S Ro' hehe.<br>
<br>
Er... i found the zone wall and started heading towards the zone point (or so i thought!), quickly realising that i was in unfamiliar territory, and everyone else had gone through before me (luckily the gobs had followed the others), i about turned and headed toward the zone proper this time hehe.<br>
I had to charge headlong through the pack of goblins, who on losing the others, had spotted me lagging behind, and were obviously baying for blood. Scary as hell, but i made it, and thankfully so had everyone else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>
<br>
At that point, we decided it best to call it a night. Stannis and Pinbin camped, Hagruk went to Feeport to do some last minute shopping (alcohol i bet *winks at Hagruk*), and i paid a visit to the local merchant on the commons, to stock up, and cook froglock, and gator steaks hehe<br>
<br>
Well, not quite the glorious end to the evening that it could've been, but more important than glory, it was an absolute blast, to be repeated as soon as possible hehe.<br>
<br>
I too, will remember that battle with those five (or was it six) HUGE! minotaurs, for a very long time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>

You can't fight in the hallways.  Move to a side room, any side room asap, or for some reason, they will continue to come out of the woodwork.  And never, ever, med in the hallways.  Its like you're wearing Od 'da Fly or something.<br>
<br>
As to Stannis problems with math, its not him, the poor dear.  Having hunted many a night in the very area you guys were in, I can tell you that maybe once in ten pulls, our puller came back with the number he predicted.  Always figure on 3, pray for 3 and hold up the cross to ward off the 5 that inevitably come.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>
<br>
Just be happy you weren't being screamed at for killstealing because your puller got jumped by a roaming named mob and three others and pulled it back to group to be killed.  *grin*  That was one of our more lively nights.<br>

Stannis just another one of his famous pulls, we start with an Enraged Wolfie, then a 4 troopers show up, then a commander.  No deaths, in the end everyone zone but Stannis and I who were to stubborn to run as usual, and we were able to survive each with a couple bubbles left.<br>

I want to go to Lower Guk someday...I wanna destroy things....I wanna find new and fantastic treasures (still drooling at the thought of an FBSS and Ykeshas) *sigh*.<br>
