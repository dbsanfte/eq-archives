Well if we are going to hate someone I say we all should hate Xianle.  All she does is hang out, take all the phat l3wt, steal all the cute Monkys, and make a general nusience of herself.  The problem isn't that we need to get rid of the hate we just need to find a proper direction for it.  Down with the Happytiger.  Kill the way to cute pegiuns.  Stop the disease that infects infects Lanys.  Stop the NYAA.<br>

What went on between you and i that night, yes it did spur this, but no it wasn't a point the finger at Adjani post. You have made it so by bringing yourself into it as a specific. I'll say this much to you, calling me Naive wasn't the only insult you made towards me. <br>
<br>
Suggesting i was going with them for the loot? Hmm, that bothered me to no end considering I am not on their point system, have mentioned to them not to put me on it, and don't normally accept loots anyways in most normal groups unless i'm really hurting for money in game. <br>
<br>
Me sending you a tell thinking <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> 'Oh Adjani, hey i haven't talked to her in forever!'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->....&quot;Hey Adj! Wazzap?!&quot; and being answered with &quot;You're a baby eater now! You raided CT with Conquest!&quot; Ok, i laughed. Ha ha, that was funny. but then i realized you weren't entirely being playful about it. <br>
<br>
Calling me Naive, telling me you felt you needed to help me open my eyes? That's also a tad....insulting. You seemed to have this mentality.. like.. if someone didn't see things your way they were blinded..? Maybe i'm seeing things. The fact that you couldn't accept MY activities during the game (considering they've done nobody harm)made me snap and think wait a second... friends don't do this, friends accept eachother even if they wouldn't agree with them 100% on everything. <br>
<br>
And so like people who cross me in game, or make me upset, insult me or anything else... something i know isn't going to stop.. (i.e.- Fights over differing opinions. Let's face it, people aren't all going to have the same views.) i just resigned myself to forgetting about it. I just don't speak to you anymore, i don't know you. Who's Adjani? Maybe i'll meet her some day! Call me childish but this leaves my arguements with people on a lot more peaceful note (for myself). Nobody wins, nobody is right. I only wanted to see other people's views on this kind of thing. If i had wanted to bring you into it specifically i would have made some mention of you. <br>

Anyhow, enough of this from you Adjani, and enough of this from me. I don't want to hear this from you on the message board. If you want to keep arguing over who is blind and who is ignorant and what not then i'm sorry. I'm not going to run circles with you. Let's PLEASE either lock this thread, or return to our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> discussion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of this subject. I'm sick of the finger pointing and cow tipping. <br>
<br>
This was supposed to be a general discussion of what other people felt on this subject. So now back to the subject PLEASE! I'm not posting here to win arguements or even to argue. I'm posting here because this is a message board and people come to these things to share their thoughts and views and opinions.

I have found having Adjani on ignore makes the game much more enjoyable, avoiding her on the boards is a little more see the diarrea of the mouth problem she has.<br>

Sadly no we can't all get along, there will always be people like Adjani or Celeasta (who is long overdue to come make a CQ comment on this thread) chewin on my nuts whenever they can.</font><P><hr size="1"> <img src="http://kaylain.homestead.com/files/pics/frostheart.jpg" alt="Grizley and Kaylain Frostheart"><br>

Sadly, Grizley is correct about things.. And no matter how hard one might try to get along with everyone it will never happen.. Its life.. You learn to ignore those that you cannot stand and aviod them as much as possible.. <br>
<br>
Then there are others like Adanji that has something to say about everything.. No matter what its about and always think that the way she feels about things is always CORRECT.. Sorry to say it but 95% of the time you are WRONG! Always trying to start something or kiss someone's ass.. Cause yourself went from being &quot;i wanna raid&quot; to the next day posting that you never wanted to raid with CQ again, cause you didnt like the way we do things.. I am sure alot of raids you attend you dont fully 100% agree with how everything is handled.. But you go, have fun, and maybe even get alittle reward out of going.. Thats what raids are suppost to be, along with something challenging..<br>
<br>
Just because someone has a certain type of guildtag doesnt mean you hate everyone in that guild and that they all act the same.. Xianle is Xianle shes human (i think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and is free to choose who she wants to be friends and hangs out with.. You were friends with her before she started go places and doing things with CQ.. <br>

Getting back to the subject:  People like to generalize based on guild tags because it's easy to do.  I myself am guilty of this very same thing.  Is it right?  Probably not.  Is it a reality?  Yes.<br>

Yeah...two points illustrated.  One, it appears you like to try to ignore problems and conflicts...I like to face them.  Ignoring them solves nothing.  Two...you decided that this disagreement ended our friendship, not me.  I didn't think it had to by any means.  I didn't think either of us had to get really upset over it.  I wanted to discuss it, and express my disapproval...I do that with my friends.  I don't ignore them, I don't ostracize them, but I let them know that I don't approve.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You keeping tabs on me or something?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No...actually you were the one who told me you raid with them frequently.  I had you on my friends' list so I noticed where you were a lot, but I didn't know that you happened to be with conquest unless for some reason I happened to know where CQ was at the time.  That night I had a LOT of friends on my list who had recently left guilds and were raiding with CQ a lot lately, and it annoyed me because they left good guilds and friends they had grown up with for a chance to be &quot;uber&quot; and get the &quot;phat lewtz.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now I KNOW you are not like that, but that's just the mood I was in when you sent me the tell.  I still meant it to be a discussion and not an argument.<br>
<br>
I never let this get me upset or angry, it seems that you let it get you that way though.  I wish you hadn't, and I wish you didn't, but I can't change that.  These are my views, from my conscience, and nobody is going to make me feel that I have done something wrong or hurt anyone by having them and/or acting on them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And lastly, for those in CQ who have decided to come here and once again flame me, it is your attitudes and speeches like this that help give people the perception of you that they have. It is exactly the point that is being made here, that has now been so aptly illustrated by hou.  It is when so many people from the same guild act in the same way over and over again that people get an overall bad impression of the guild and all of its members.  But, this has been pointed out to you in the past and it has not made an impression on you, so of course this will not likely either.  </font><P><br>
