They sent a high-powered female type manager<br>
to take over. She had a rep for being a hard case. After about Nive months she bailed. At the same time oddly enough Shmedly(?) McQuaid and the original<br>
head of the guides left also. Not hard to figure out what happened.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough Shmedly(sp?) is still listed as the head of Verant, and he does<br>
post. So either they rehired him, or something else. At the time they left<br>
they said they were going to form a NEW MMORG company and run it the way they wanted. Not hard to figure out that SONY had its own ideas.<br>
<br>
So the upshot is, Verant is a milk cow for Sony, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
There will be nothing innovative anytime soon. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

<br>
Bottomline it is about dollars and time and they could care less about your balance or your pali or cleric or any other little rants you may have. They never have and they never will. As long as you keep paying them bucks and spending loads of time on the game they are doing well as a business. <br>
<br>
Dont you think Sony hires shrinks and such to evaluate your behaviour? You think they do not parse your messages? They read it all and have you right where they want you, millions of hours invested in a toon world while another great summer outside passes by you are concerned about a make believe world on a servers harddrive.<br>
<br>
The more time you spend and rant the less likely you will quit. This has worked great for them and is why they are making hordes of dough and will continue to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2133<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/4/02 1:45:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3601.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thanks Verant</span><hr size=1> According to a couple of guys on the safehouse the patch is for the buff stacking issue. They've screwed a great deal of buffs up and buffs are being overwritten by effects. Obviously they got it right with the big buffs but some went a little odd I guess.<br>
<br>
It may be that they have to revert stacking until to the way it was till they sort it.<br>
<br>
Oh and Ghia..the cleric hammer is a little different from you 100point DD proc in that it procs without the cleric needing to hit and it procs extremely fast. Clerics are already reporting a DPS of 50 or so and thats with standard stuff that costs no more then 100pp. Add to that the fact that most clerics have low skill in weapons at the moment and zero haste and you don't need to be a genious to realise this is going to go up. Clerics will want dragon haste, they'll max out their skills in both 1hb and bash and further add to that damage. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Brad McQuaid was forced by Schmed and SoE to resign just prior to the release of Scars of Velious. <br>
<br>
Schmed stayed on, since he is actually the advocate for listening to the players.<br>
<br>
Brad's vision of 'Our World' was costing them players. Immediatly upon the departure of Mr McQuaid is when we started to see the 'Wow they finally listened to us' changes.<br>

<br>
That is a BIG difference from saying that he listens to the players.<br>
<br>
I have even written him personal e-mail on several topics. Never even got a reply.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is (for me) there is no advocate at Verant for my class. It will not<br>
get better than it is. It could easily get worse.<br>
<br>
I dont want to hear about how getting item x will solve problem y<br>
<br>
The issue I am focused on, items should NOT matter. Verant can easily control<br>
how many items drop, just by controlling the spawn rates. (al la Ragefire)<br>
This is an OLD OLD DM dodge dating back to the early D&amp;D game.<br>
<br>
Make sure you never introduce anything the players REALLY want into the game.<br>
Only give them crap they dont want. Pretend that its all random. Always claim<br>
that nothing is predjudicial.<br>
<br>
Lay out alot of disposable items that they will simply sell. Potions are a good choice.<br>
<br>
The answer is to bomb SONY, not Verant. Verant WONT change. SONY however<br>
(at times) is a real business. You just might get lucky.<br>
<br>
<br>
That isnt even subtle. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

We need to remember that there is no end to this game, that is why people have played for 3 years.  They want you happy, cause people pay when happy... but giving you what you want when you want it isn't always good business.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I am curious what new leveling they are going to offer in PoP.  I know that characters are going to get more powerful and I think they are trying to head off the fast leveling post 50 so people can enjoy PoP.  Guess we sill see.<br>

<br>
I think not.<br>
<br>
It's possible that some uber cleric somewhere has done 50dps at some point...but most clerics at 60 with a little AA are parsing in at 25-30dps...40 if a fight goes completely perfectly and they don't need to stop and heal halfway through the fight.<br>
<br>
Pallies are making a mountain out of a molehill here...it's sick the way they are going to every class MB out there and screaming &quot;nerf clerics.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pallies/SKs are the best tanks out there if the mob is slowable/doesn't need defensive ...I'd like to see a cleric try to tank and hold aggro on a mob that hits for 600+ under normal circumstances(i.e. isn't under a 2 second CH chain).  <br>
<br>
When a group needs a TANK they are going to pick the pally...not the cleric.   When a group needs a damage dealer they are going to pick the monk or rogue...not the cleric.  When a group needs a healer they are going to pick the cleric...or maybe the druid after next patch.  The cleric's place in groups is a little more insecure than the pally's with that spectre looming overhead.<br>
<br>
But as has been proven time and time again, nerfs are bad for all involved mmm'k?<br>

<br>
I'm a little annoyed, as a warrior I really cant solo for @#%$, I can kill a few blues then I've lost about 5,000 hp which I regen back at about 11 per 6 seconds sitting down, or I bandaid for about 100 every 14 seconds, takes for bloody ever, so I have to partner with a decent healer, for that I have a level 51 cleric that I leveled up a bit and moved onto a spare account, with my recent equip upgrades I could kill the shrooms in FG quite fast working on it about 8 per repop, cause I actually had some healing, I didnt have the cleric grouped with me a lot of the time so I made about 1yellow AA per hour<br>
<br>
now... The shrooms slow me + stun me a HECK of a lot more with 122 DR, self plus cleric buff on me, not much more I Can get than that unless I start having to wear Pure resist gear for xping........ so with slow hitting more I kill a little slower, not much of a problem as I only ever xped at a 7 spawn spot anyway, but where as I used to keep it completely clear now there is always 1 poped.  And the Xp is definately worse, before I could hit auto attack and watch TV or something and just glance to see when needed healing and when outa range, made 5 blue per hour, now I concentrated on the fights for a whole hour and made 4 blue ... so thats at LEAST a 20% nerf in the xp, probably more if I tried without concentrating...<br>
<br>
why the hell neft what I need 2 characters to effectively do??? its not like 5 hours for an AA is fast anyway when you need 5-9 to even click a useful button !<br>
<br>
/Rude SoE, <br>
<br>
There are still a lot of usefulish aa's I'd like to get but if there going to make me need to spend hundreds of hours having to pay attention to killing the same boring hard fight high level mobs instead of afk xping and occasionally having a fun xp group I doubt I'll bother. <p>Marshall Submina Dominatrix<BR>

Then why Bitch? If you aren't having fun then quit! There are at least 20 aa's I would like to get but I don't have the time to put in to get them, but I also don't bitch about it. Either get them or don't , quit or don't....I just try to have fun and play the game. <br>

But i find it really screwed that a 60 cleirc killed the whole DR camp(both the cleirc and dragoon) in Lesser fye with no down time(single pulls mind you) and losing less then 10-20 precent mana. I cannot do that with full raid buffs as a 60 ranger in decent equipment duel wielding, epic slowed etc. I still am oom and half life at the end of it. Overall, once the newness wears down i think it will even out. Regardless of what is done, cleircs are the best overall healers for raid situations, yes ir screws up the 60 exp game a bit, yes there will be a few melee who die because the clerics are trying their new toys. But after the newness wears off, itll go back to cleircs sit on their ass and heal while the melee melee. Clerics will never be a tanking class, if for no other reason the only true aggro spells they got are their healing class. Any ranger/sk/war will still hold aggro over them. I imagine, at least for the clerics from day one, they will get back into the old routine and it will go back to normal in the main game. But i do agree, it sucks about them changing the low blue to regular blue exp thing. I was liking soloing shrooms pretty much nonstop and my exp moving pretty nicely. Oh well ill still hunt there, just will take longer. They didnt stop the exp for them guys, they just slowed it down some. Its all about making the dollars.<br>

I'm a 58 cleric and was grouped with a shaman, druid, Beastlord, Paladin and warrior last night. We were having a ball and we were all laughing our ass off at the way my new hammer was proc'ing on the mob. With shaman dex buffs or focus it was going off about 7 times a fight, hitting anywhere from 80 to 150 DD each time.<br>
<br>
They weren't bitching and moaning because a cleric got a little something to spice things up for their class. Instead they were cheering me on, laughing and having a good time. Once, I had to zone because another group came to the zone with a train and they told me to come back in cause they needed someone to tank the mob. It was a joke!<br>
<br>
I'm actually glad to see that the tougher mobs now give more exp. I used to hate to hunt in Luclin where the mobs had a bizillion HP's and you got no where near the return as you did for the quick and easy stuff in OS or Chardok. I actually got 1.5 blue bubbles in about 3 hours last night. <br>
<br>
People need to relax and quit worrying about other classes getting something that another class excel's at. Clerics will still be primary healers even if Shamans and Druids get a nicer heal. Paladins will still out tank a cleric and I'm sure in a short time you solo'rs will once again find just the right spot. <br>
<br>
I guess I'm not taking it so hard because #1, I don't solo and #2 I don't try to put together the perfect group. We usually just grab whatever class comes along in need of some exp to help us out. <br>
<br>
Relax and have fun :) <p>Caelie<BR>
