<br>
I'm liberal.  I'm Jewish.  I didn't vote for Bush, and I'm not sorry I didn't.  I don't support genocide, and I don't think, despite the propaganda the Palestinians would feed you, that the Israeli's are perpetuating it.  <br>
<br>
I woke up Tuesday morning to hear the Eagle broadcasting a horror story.  For those not in the DFW area, the Eagle is our answer to the hard rock station.  They provide jokes, not serious news.  It took me a couple of minutes to fully wake up and realize something was terribly wrong.  <br>
<br>
Once I stumbled out of bed and into the living room, I saw a nightmare before my eyes.  One tower in flames.  I watched in horror as the 2nd plane hit the 2nd tower.  My mind told me it wasn't real, I was watching some sort of hollywood prank.  Despite my repeatedly changing the channel, the picture didn't change.  The towers were still in flames, people were screaming.<br>
<br>
I saw inhabitants of the tower jump to their death.  Despite the fact that I spend a good portion of my time studying forensic images, pathology, it was, by far, the most horrible thing I had ever seen.<br>
<br>
I stood in shock as they flashed images of the Pentagon on the screen.  I watched as the towers fell.  I spoke to my friends and family at American Airlines as they related the tragedy to me.  I had confirmation that people that were part of my family were most certainly dead.  I say family with a relative term.  American Airlines is a family, and as I have several relatives that work for them, they are an extended family.<br>
<br>
I spoke to my friends, another part of my extended family in IRC, in IM's.  Today, I can't tell you what I said, just that the terror was more than I could bear.<br>
<br>
I read posts from my friends online.  Posts from people I didn't know, posts from people I don't like.<br>
<br>
Never, not once, did I sit in my chair and say &quot;I can't believe he said that, what a jerk&quot;<br>
<br>
I mourned the loss of innocence, the anger I saw, the grief.  <br>
<br>
I'm not an overly emotional person.  Despite the fact that I'm female, I don't cry at the drop of a hat.  ET didn't make me cry.  The loss I saw on the faces of the firemen of NYC drove me to tears.  I saw strong, grown men cry, and I couldn't bear it.  If I could take one sliver of their pain from them, I would.<br>
<br>
I watched my childrens sense of safety and innocence wither away.  I remember growing up an AF brat.  I remember seeing the missile silos, being in Turkey and not going to school due to bomb threats.  I would have never dreamed my children would live the same threat.  My innocence and trust is shattered.  <br>
<br>
I gather my friends and family close.  They are all precious to me, they were before this, but even more so now.  If I haven't talked to you recently, be assured that you are in my thoughts.<br>
<br>
As the week has progressed, I've thought long and hard.  What would and should we do?<br>
<br>
I believe we have no choice but to retaliate.  I don't like it, but I accept it.<br>
<br>
To let this pass unchallenged would be in invitation to everyone to perpetuate a campaign of death against our country.<br>
<br>
Civilians will die as a result of the action we must take.  This doesn't make me happy, it doesn't make me celebrate, it doesn't make me smile.  But what other choice is there.<br>
<br>
Shall we send a message that we are an easy target?  If we have to lay waste to an entire nation to send a message that we are not to be trifled with, then so be it.  If we must decimate a people to show our children that we do not tolerate such barbarism, so be it.<br>
<br>
I will not stand idly by and watch my friends, my family, my countrymen slaughtered in the name of whatever cause someone celebrates.  As much as i would love to turn the other cheek, I cannot.  The pain I watched my friends and family suffer has driven a spike thru me.  I feel lost and adrift.  <br>
<br>
I want everyone in this world to understand that messing with us will bring pain and suffering.  As much as I wish I could turn the other cheek, as much as I wish I could forget this pain, I cannot.  I wish to show the world that the suffering perpetuated upon me is nothing compared to what I will deal out, nothing compared to what my country will do, nothing compared to what will happen.<br>
<br>
I wish I could sit back and forgive.  I cannot.  I've waited days, my pain has not lessened.  My need to protect my children has not alleviated.  I hurt. <br>
<br>
I do not like Bush, I did not vote for him, and I'm not sorry I didn't.  I could list you a thousand facts why.  However, if he does what needs to be done, to show the entire world that this will not be tolerated, I will shut my mouth and never, not once, say another thing about him again.  I will stand behind him and support him.  <br>
<br>
I am angry.  I am hurt.  I am fury.  I am American.  I am woman.  Fear my scorn. Fear my wrath.  <br>
<br>
The claws are unsheathed.  I will protect my friends and family with a fury unseen prior to now.  I want those children, those adults who celebrated our deaths to reap the punishment.  I want them to learn that this is not acceptable.  I want them to see that this will bring them only pain.  I want them to second guess what they have been taught.<br>
<br>
I no longer want to place blame in our country.  I do not blame arab-americans.  i do not blame liberals.  I do not blame homosexuals, feminists.  I blame the inhuman monsters that did this to my country.<br>
<br>
I will not be satisfied until you are dead.  <br>
<br>
I am righteous.<br>
<br>
I am fury.<br>
<br>
