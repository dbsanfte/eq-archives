Im pretty sure that flamefest was started by yours truely.<br>
<br>
Actually, it wasn't all of guk, it was just everything past the executioner. Of course, that's basically everything that would give me and my group xp back then.<br>
<br>
Regardless, the truely humorous thing is that out of the 6 people who went without xp that day since there was none other to be had, 4 went on to become Da`Kor members. One quit entirely, and one quit until a few days ago (hi me!). Anyone who wasn't 50 back before kunark can't possibly understand what it was like. There were exactly two places you could go to get exp. Lower guk (past the exe if you were 48+), or SolB (and back then bats and bugs were really hard, people were using 6/23 weapons and wearing bronze at 50) Furthermore, you couldn't just go to EC and drop 6k for a sash, there were maybe 10 of them on the entire server. If you wanted to upgrade loot you *had* to go to guk. Period.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, *I*'m over it. I have been for a long time. Really. The reason I put this post here is for this alone:<br>
<br>
Chiteng, don't mention my old gripes against Da`Kor to try to further your cause. You're a fruit, and I don't want to be in any way associated with your witchhunt. Back in the day it was fun battling it out on the board w/ Da`Kor, but that got old sometime last century.<br>

<br>
the funniest thing i can remember happened recently (relatively speaking...).  after rand retired rannd at level fifty and made raand (cleric), he never picked up the paly until over a year later at least.  one of the times he played him he ran on down to dead side lower guk.  he was always /roleplay, so couldn't see what level/class he was and he bumped into some people camping the lord (i think).  he walked in and started pulling for them, brought them tons of stuff, i think at some point they grouped him and he just kept pulling and tanking for them.  then he healed himself before he took off for another run, and one of the group freaked out asking how he did that.  rand was like...did what?  the guys asks how he healed himself.  rand says &quot;i'm a paly, we get that spell...&quot;  and the entire group flipped out, they all thought he was a warrior.  when they found out he was a level fifty paly (lower level than some of them and their warrior), they could NOT believe it.  <br>
<br>
i watched that incident and thought DAMN, what happened to this game, it used to be so much harder...<br>
<br>
vendrix:<br>
<br>
luckily, beba didn't need to type fast, he had me and rand (i won't say flam cause not even we could figure out what he was saying most of the time..) to say what he needed to say.  and i think that was why beba was never a main puller, made a good secondary though.  i type fast enough for the both of us, last time i tested at 70+ words per minute, i think beba would test maybe at five.  i think it's from holding conversations in three second intervals as a bard.  forced me to type out what i had to say REAL fast.  hehe.<br>
<br>
i suppose you found a negative though, i'll send you your medal.<br>
<br>
oh oh, chiteng, <br>
<br>
you're starting to get a little sloppy.  you've said many times that if dakor would just admit to their transgressions, you would be satisfied and leave them alone...yet here you are, admitting that in recent months they have finally been doing just that, still harping on them.  what IS your point now?  i mean, really, what is it you are fighting for now that you are still harassing them?  <br>
<br>
honestly, i've got lots of great negative things to say to dakor, because we have done things to each other that were messed up.  launching crap back and forth on msg boards that have since been retired because no common ground could be reached.  but you know what, it's not worth my time, all of that is SO long in the past, it would be like still being mad at my older brother for terrorizing me when i was a child (i always got back at him though, i was a good liar).<br>
<br>
fact is, some of them are still my friends.  i can tell you from my own experience, tzzird can most certainly be something other than a jerk.  at a vox raid i once passed on a haste belt that i had already won to freddy (old ice clan ranger) because i found out he didn't have one yet.  it was my opinion that a ranger could make a far more efficient use of the haste than i could as a bard.  i passed something up that i wanted for the good of the whole, where i saw it benefit us the most.  i learned that from tzzird.  back before i knew him all that well, i saw him do the same types of things, thought it was an admirable quality and incorporated it into my own in game functioning.  just because he was a jerk to you doesn't mean he is incapable of not being one.  i met him in real life, i promise, he's not a monster at all, quite normal.<br>
<br>
and kuzic (well, ok, teuvas), yeah, kuz is a piece of work.  i once classified him as a gaming mercenary.  i told him about it, and he started laughing, couldn't deny it.  he goes where ever the fun is.  if he's not having fun where he's at, he goes somewhere else.  oh yeah, it's not a very favorable way to be.  everquest guilds define themselves on loyalty, people who leave guilds often lose friends and when they join a new guild, new animosity arises between them.  but you know, after he went from dakor to umoja back to dakor, to UO where he (and azurathe) convinced us (umojans) to come play with them, back to dakor in daoc, and then to playing with ice clan now in daoc, i've decided something about kuzic.  THEY ARE GAMES, and he views them as such.  he never stops talking to his friends in dakor, he never stops talking to his friends in umoja, and he never stops talking to his friends in ice clan.  no matter where he is, he doesn't let his friends slip away, even though it's so easy to do, almost expected. <br>
<br>
i like kuzic, he's funny, has a great personality, he likes fudge and pepsi late at night.  makes him hyper and a lot more funny.  i'm sorry chiteng, but i wouldn't give up a friend like him because he plays a game in a way that i may not agree with.  it seems shallow and superficial to me, i'll welcome him into my guild no matter how many times he leaves it to go somewhere that better suits him at the time, because he's my friend, i don't question that, ever.  and i doubt any of his other friends do either.  so when you ask how people can let people like him into their guild, or let him stay, the answer is simple.  friends are friends, they don't always have to agree with each other, but they don't cut each other off because of those disagreements.<br>
<br>
dakor has been telling you that same thing for years (YEARS, chiteng).  it's as true now as it ever was then.  <br>

Do you recall the thread where Vendrix stated he would group with Satan<br>
if Satan was a good player?<br>
<br>
So is it merely a case of how bad the person must be? Is that truely what you mean? Dont you see petty bullying as offensive. How many times have your heard<br>
in guild chat something that made you cringe. You say Tzzird impressed you with his generosity. Tell me, did he have a use for the items or were they extraneous.<br>
TRUE generosity is only evidenced when YOU need an item and you give it away.<br>
All else is posturing. Some sincere some base. Yes Tzzird can be many things.<br>
He can in fact be fun to be around. Until you cross him. Then things dont seem so<br>
freindly. Frosty was capable of true generosity. I am reminded of that every time I dont drown.<br>
<br>
You cant temporize with gradients of behavior. Some behavior is simply bad.<br>
Read Vendrix last thread about Justicia. He didnt exactly lie but he didnt tell the whole story. You know the story didnt end there. He and crew made damn sure they maligned her from one end of the server to the next. There was no one who didnt know how DK felt about that issue. Kanya you knew Justicia, did she deserve that? You knew Priss, would she defend a freind who had done such things?<br>
For that matter would Lexi?<br>
<br>
From your post I can gather you are saying I am too extreme. Yes I am. Sadly only by being extreme do you get heard. To answer your question from last night,<br>
to judge a possible innocent based on incidents that they have no knowledge of is wrong. Most of the current members of DK have no idea what the real issues are or were. I am forced to modify my stance from a Time when I WAS certain they all knew. I react to their truculent posts surely, but I dont judge them as evil, just as sheep. <br>
<br>
Anyone who says 'its only a game' to justify base behavior exibits truely the lowest<br>
form. It doesnt matter how much time they cost someone, how much hurt feelings,<br>
lost self esteem etc  Its only a game right? Do you actually believe that Kanya?<br>
Does Rannd? Does Flamminghand <br>
I really hope not. I had thought those types of players stayed on UO to prey upon each other.<br>
<br>
If you had a close freind or even a lover, and one day you found 5 bodies in the basement. Would you turn them in? How about if the bodies were merely incinerated cats? How about merely skinned toads? Do you see that I cant make that type of distinction? Right/Wrong Black/White<br>
<br>
As for leaving them alone if the merely addmitted the wrong doing.<br>
I am not convinced yet. Its only Vendrix Kerrol and Tuan. Hardly a quorum.<br>
I havent heard Ogmuk or Naru come down off their lofty perch and admit error.<br>

<br>
you again rely on speculation regarding circumstances and issues based on your own biased view of how things MUST have been.<br>
<br>
you see, the things i watched tzz hand down were things he could use, weapons, armor, what do you think impressed me to begin with?  i'm not a child chiteng, i can distinguish a difference between someone trying to make themselves look good, and someone who is just being who they are.  you must know that tzz didn't care so much about what others thought of him, he didn't do anything to impress anyone else, he did them because that's just the way he was.  the same with why he did things to you that weren't particualarly nice.  do you honestly believe someone who is out to make themselves look SO good would go out of their way to make someone else look so bad?  he understood that you can't please everyone, so you just do what you do and accept the consequences, good and bad.  it just happened that your extremist point of view alienated you from others naturally.  tzzird might have made the threat, but i'm sorry chiteng, you make yourself look worse than he ever could.  he didn't even have to say anything, nothing.  i never heard him say a negative word about you other than fighting with you here.  i can tell you he didn't go out of his way to get me (or anyone i know for that matter) to dislike you, he never mentioned you.  EVER.  i'd say he was just angry and leveled an empty threat at you.  i never even knew he made such a threat in your direction until you came here saying he did.  i'd put money down that no one else knew either.  <br>
<br>
many people may agree with you, chiteng, but even some who would side with you take offense at the way you argue your points.  the complete lack of acknowledgement for the fact that these are people you are harassing is in total contradiction to your entire fight.  if you REALLY thought vendrix was SERIOUS when he made that statement, you are letting this whole thing carry you away and need to take a step back.  he's merely fanning your flame when he says things like that.  he, and everyone else, knows you'll rise to the bait and never grasp the concept underlying the antagonism.  he effectively makes you look like a dunce, chiteng.  you lose more and more credibility everytime you allow him to goad you into taking him seriously.  he tried to tell you, as have other members of dakor, that they don't care...that should be a clue, they are only fighting with you to make you look worse, not to defend themselves anymore.  they don't need to.  your own stubborn need to drag this out is your undoing in the long run.  many have told you that.  many of us who aren't dakor, don't have their want for you to &quot;just go away&quot;...most of us just think it's time for you to let it be done.  there is nothing to win, the game is over.  you got some people banned on another server, i'm assuming that was the end of that.  they were gone, although i doubt they learned their lesson.  dakor has left everquest, they are gone, shouldn't it be the end of it?  if it's about teaching people lessons, you'll keep failing.<br>
<br>
you say you don't see a distinction between the realm of the living and the realm of fantasy in an online game.  you equate the murder of people by a loved one to the action of a friend moving from guild to guild amongst his friends who may or may not get along anymore.  you parallel AWFUL real life tradedy with in game drama.  i'll tell you, i DO see a difference, i DO separate the two.  but i'll give you this to reflect upon.  in real life, people hurt people.  i, personally, have hurt people i LOVE horribly, i have hurt people i barely know, and i've hurt a lot of people that i will never even know i hurt.  but i am a NICE person, it's just a fact.  if you are going to see no difference between the actions inside a fantasy world and the actions of the real world, you are gonna have to understand that people are gonna hurt people.  sometimes they'll be sorry, and sometimes they won't, sometimes they won't even know.<br>
<br>
regarding justicia...you know chiteng, i think i already made myself clear on something.  maybe you didn't getit quite yet.  you knew a side of tzzird and kuzic that was bad, i knew a side of them that was not.  this applies to ALL people.  even you have said you are that way.  you said the only time you are &quot;ugly&quot; is here on these boards when you fight with dakor (and other boards when you fought with other people) but that there is another side to you that is friendly and unlike the vindictive crusader you seem to be here.  what on earth makes you think justicia would be any different just because she had good friends like priss, lexi, and tristra (i notice you left her name off that list)?  kuzic has friends like that, tzzird does as well.  honestly decent people who would vouch for them.  people you yourself consider good people who are close friends with both these individuals.  people who may not like everything about them, but respect them nonetheless.  i think justicia did deserve the treatment she had from these individuals, just i think they deserved what they got in return.  she was quite capable of fighting back, and she did at every chance she got.  she was not a helpless victim, and would probably be insulted that you seem to be implying it.  but, being that i believe people have their good and bad sides, i also think she deserves the loyalty and friendship of people like you, who come to her defense, i'm sure she earned it of you, just as she earned the malice agianst her held by people who don't like her.<br>
<br>
perhaps someday, if both sides should wish it, it could be repaired, perhaps someday the two of you will have a falling out and damage will be done that may or may not be reparable.  but that is an entirely different issue altogether, isn't it..<br>
<br>
obviously, i am not an extreme person.  it's why i cannot for the life of me understand how you can put some of the things together that you do.  you speak another language and it seems rediculous and nonsensical to me when i read it.  i do have my ideas of right and wrong, but damn, i could never be black and white about it.  as i said, i'm not some young kid who is just here to pick fights, i've lived a lot, seen a lot, heard a lot, and i paid attention.  as a result, i have a hard time with absolute condemnation based on the actions of individuals in a video game environment.  <br>
<br>
understand one other thing.  i'm a pretty avid gamer.  i form very close bonds with people i meet in these games, they are real to me.  but unlike you, the reality of them brings me to be more forgiving, and more understanding of their actions in game, because i can see beyond that and realize there is more to them than those actions.  that's why i'm able to say that justicia deserves friendship and caring even though she would have walked right by my corpse that her train killed, merely because i had a dakor tag.  she didn't know me, might have liked me, but it was black and white for her, wasn't it...<br>
<br>
to me, that's wrong, but i would have offered to help her anyway if i had caused her harm unintentionally, because i don't see things that way.  i cannot hate like that (believe me, i can seriously dislike people), i'm sorry that there are people who can.  but then, my non extremist self says that if they can, their love is probably fierce.<br>
