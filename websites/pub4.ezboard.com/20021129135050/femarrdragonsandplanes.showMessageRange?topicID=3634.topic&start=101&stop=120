Crypte knew VI wouldn't find him at fault in the matter so he took the mob.  He knew he was &quot;third in line&quot;, it would appear he watched gun slowly die.  He didn't help out the dying mid lvl character. and then soon as he hit the ground he disced and attacked the mob.  he clearly intended to ks razer who had clearly been there before him.  <br>
<br>
so no techincally he wasn't &quot;wrong&quot;.  but he clearly lacks a lvl of ethical standards that you would, at least i do, hope to find in everyone.  <br>

So given his lack of integrity treat him as you see fit.<br>

<br>
This is not a rule inforced by the GM's ... however it is a rule that someone can find themselves being flamed about if they break it on these boards.. and by the other players in game.<br>
<br>
Probably in everquest the thing I hate the most is to get KS'd... I am lucky to be able to say when i did the Stormfeather camp i was the only person there when it popped and i didn't have any competition or greedy people around who were willing to sacrifice there reputation for a rare mob.<br>
<br>
Had someone like crypte been around and KS'd me I don't really even know what I would do.. it would likely be enough to make me quit the game after wasting days of my life just to get ripped off... and certainly enough to make me do everything in my power to get him back.<br>
<br>
I have been KS'd a lot of times soloing etc.. so I have an idea of how it feels.. I feel bad for Razer for getting ripped off like this.. and for the other guy who died.<br>
<br>
Reading this certainly put Crypte on my bad side.. I hope ToF does something about him. <p>Radon</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uxazrizshazbot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xazriz Shazbot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/02 7:54:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crypte = ASS. stormfeather rant, ignore if you want :P</span><hr size=1> oops, me = suicidalsamuri.... <p>Xazriz Shazbot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           My Equip:  <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=177285> Here </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugudanak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gudanak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/02 8:01:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Maybe I shouldpost</span><hr size=1> Ok, I hate rants and flames boards... but I wanna get a few things strait.<br>
<br>
1)I'm a 42rogue<br>
2)The only reason I was pissed was not because I lost the loot, but because someone was an A$$ about the camp<br>
3)AToF is a great guild, I look up to them for being mostly nice people.  And it pains me to see a weed among roses. I don't want anyone to bash them just because one of ass.  I even know some of his guildies that don't like him<br>
4)Yeah I died, and I respect that fact that since I didn't have the strength to kill some thing that was blue to me that I shouldn't have it. But someone was gracious enough to help me just a moment to late.  What pisses me off is when people wait on the corner... wait til something is almost dead. attack it and run off and basically giving us the finger.<br>
5)I'm not going to rant and friggin flame because if a group of pixals. And I know ranting won't affect people like crypte.  But for the sake of new people in the game at least play curteously.<br>
<br>
Yeah I lost a nice item... big deal... The big deal to me is that I've lost respect in someone who I once had respect in... People have lost respect for a big group of great people.  To the other members of AToF that I know I tip my hat to you, keep up the great work in your guild, and I wish you safe hunting. To Crypte.... be happy you have a group of friends that try to cover for you.  Cause if I was a guild leader and knew you would be rude, I wouldn't let you in.<br>
<br>
Saying that this is the last time I'm looking at this board.  Safe travels friends.

<br>
(1)Razer say's,<br>
Gudanak gets a cougar add so I say &quot;want help?&quot; and then start to kill the cougar. cougar dies, Gudanak says &quot;crap, dead&quot; but before he dies he says &quot;please don't loot map piece&quot; so I move in to kill storm for him and wait, assuming he's bound on dock<br>
<br>
And Wait ??? Wait for What ??<br>
<br>
(2)Razer say's,<br>
Gudanak's corpse hasn't even hit the ground yet and Crypte starts to attack Stormfeather.<br>
<br>
(3) Razor Say's,<br>
I only have 1 point here, because nothing can be done and Crypte has admitted he's not nice already. I just want other people to watch out for him because he is an @#%$, just like all the other lowlife KS'ers on this server who pull this @#%$.<br>
<br>
Um.. You waited to engage. Spoken in your own words.<br>
I think you missed your chance. and Storm may have <br>
been ultimatly killed by another. IMO<br>
<br>
(4)Crypte Say's,<br>
Dead wrong. His corpse hits the floor, I attack, then you attack...so I /disc duelist. Gudanak whiped, he had his chance. He failed. I killed, the piece is undoubtably mine.<br>
<br>
AGAIN Proving You hesitated to KILL or Attack.. Again <br>
you are wrong Razor.. *Then you attack.<br>
what exactly were you waiting for Razor ? His Corpse to<br>
be looted and by then the mob 1 mile away and open for anyone ?? Give me a break !<br>
<br>
(5) Razor say's,<br>
you see 1 person fail to kill him, so instead of respecting person number 2, you kill the mob.<br>
<br>
<br>
Um Razor ? You didnt attack.. You hesitated and chose <br>
the path that you thought was right.. but what you did<br>
not consider, was that there was another person in line<br>
and You failed by not attacking first...<br>
<br>
<br>
Judgement for the Defendant with Honor. By default the<br>
petitioner did NOT and I repeat Did NOT attack the mob<br>
in question untill The Defendant attacked. therefore by<br>
doing so and Claiming on this board that He the Plaintiff<br>
decided to assist the Dead person, Failed to recognize <br>
the true order of law in Norrath, therefore Giving up his/her<br>
personal rights to all litigation in the matter of <br>
Razor -vs- Crypte in the matter of Gudanak -vs- spawn.<br>
<br>
The Hammer is down.. Case dismissed...<br>

<br>
I dunno since he cant post in here anymore.<br>
<br>
Using the he engaged first excuse on a FFA mob is not in question.. Cryptte engaged first on his and Razers account, but the time period is very small even on Crypttes statement you qouted <br>
<br>
(4)Crypte Say's,<br>
Dead wrong. His corpse hits the floor, I attack, then you attack...so I /disc duelist. Gudanak whiped, he had his chance. He failed. I killed, the piece is undoubtably mine.<br>
<br>
so what maybe a second? 2?<br>
<br>
Not disputing VI's rule on a FFA mob just something I personally wouldnt do and would prefer to stay away from people that thought since its OK in VI's eyes its fine.<br>
<br>
Razer was there before Cryptte .. Cryptte new it.. Razer tries to help Gundark with an add.. Gundark dies ... Cryptte attacks...<br>
<br>
Cryptte obviously had some idea of an order going on or he would of tried to engage the mob before Gundark.. Jumping in front of Razer whatever he intended to do with the loot in my eyes is wrong. <br>
<br>
Hell if Razer was higher level  and killed SF I dont doubt Cryptte woulda petitioned him saying that he engaged first and Razer ksed him and won the petition.. does that make it right?<br>

Well guess what im not disputing who attacked first.<br>
<br>
I fail to see how im not understanding what happened here please enlighten me. I have never once said that i thought the anything should go to the guy that died. I stated that what Cryptte did was not against VI's rules since he engaged first .<br>
<br>
I did say waiting for someone to die so you can skip over the next person that has been waiting longer then you is a extremly shitty thing to do.<br>

I did say that i wouldnt do what he did in that situation and it was an extremly shitty thing to do .<br>

<br>
Stormfeather spawns in 1 place not in a large area where it might take you a minute or 2 to see if he is up.<br>
<br>
From what I have found most people will atleast say they are respecting your camp at Stormfeather.. aka log, or say they are waiting till after you get him or waiting to see when he spawns so they have it timed.<br>
<br>
As far as the AC camp.. there are usually quite a few people around capable of killing it and when i have seen it up a lot of the times there have been people /shouting about whose it is and claiming to be KS'd.<br>
<br>
I think most would agree SF = Camp and AC in Sro = First to attack it gets it. <p>Xazriz Shazbot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           My Equip:  <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=177285> Here </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormarctruelight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormarc Truelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/19/02 12:27:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3634.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chuk...</span><hr size=1> Wow, Stormfeather is a boring horrible camp as it is.(wouldnt be so bad if green con cougers didnt attack you &gt;&lt;) i cant believe people actually sit there in line behind the person camping it.

<br>
anyhow, it comes down to common curtosey and respect, Crypte Didnt Ks the mob, you have said that, he waited for the guy to die, then took the mob, alrough i feel most people will agree that it was not a nice thing or the right thing to do, with someone there ahead of him, Crypte didnt do anything wrong by the book. he followed game rules not attacking an engaged mob. I dont think its a reason to come here and Flame him.<br>

i do not know crypte and have not grouped with him, these are just my views <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15391">Tormarc Truelight</a><BR>
