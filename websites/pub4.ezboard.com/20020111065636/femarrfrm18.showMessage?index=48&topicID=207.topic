Here is the difference between you and me, Kytherion.....you change your story.  I stick to my story, whether you believe what I say, or not.  You on the other hand, change your story to support your argument.<br>
<br>
I am quite perceptive, and I certainly won't let THIS one go, bigot.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>"You're stupid, to put it bluntly. Now, being that the Israelis were too weak, too unorganized, and too ignorant, they couldn't just 'take' Palestine. See, that would take a lot of courage, and take a lot of patience and planning. Since the Israelis were not able to do anything for themselves, they were handed a free country on a silver platter."<br>
<br>
Actually, the Jews bought the land. Even though I'm stupid and ignorant, I'm aware that it was your Moslem brothers, the Turks, who sold them the land.<br>
<br>
You know...the Turks? Ottoman Empire, used Palestine as a share-cropping toilet for centuries? Sold you out.</font color><br>
<br>
Read the context.  Do you know what I am talking about in my quote?  No, because you didn't quote my entire paragraph, just the part you wanted.  Let me go out of my way to quote what I said in the post before you.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow><b>Great Britain hands someone elses country to the Israelis, because of the Holocaust.</b> You obviously don't see a problem with this, because you two are both highly ignorant individuals. You're stupid, to put it bluntly. Now, being that the Israelis were too weak, too unorganized, and too ignorant, they couldn't just 'take' Palestine. See, that would take a lot of courage, and take a lot of patience and planning. Since the Israelis were not able to do anything for themselves, they were handed a free country on a silver platter.<br>
</font color><br>
<br>
One of two things is happening here, Kytherion.  Either one you don't know how to read, or you like changing your story to support your views.<br>
<br>
Perhaps...perhaps it was an accident that you missed that first part....that makes sense in your original post....but does it make sense now that we are nearly 50 posts deep?  No, it doesn't.<br>
<br>
You are changing your story.  You want to keep your family away from me?  I want to keep my family away from you, just for how incredibly ignorant you are.  Who in the hell taught you how to read?  I am being dead serious here, I am not trying to diss you.  Who taught you how to comprehend?  Do you have any common sense at all?<br>
<br>
Also, if you intentionally tried to change your story to support your views, which I believe is the case, do you think I am so incredibly stupid that I can't go back and find it myself?<br>
<br>
You try to make me look like the idiot here, then you do this crap.  Who is looking stupid Kytherion?  YOU are looking stupid.<br>
<br>
Oh and another thing, jackass.....you didn't read any of the other threads I have been involved in.<br>
<br>
I do not hate Jews.  I hate the Israeli government.  Yes, I HATE the Israeli government.  I hate Israelis who SUPPORT the Israeli government.  Do I hate Jews?  Nope.  I never, ever claimed that.  I have Jewish friends, much like you have so-called Palestinian family.<br>
<br>
You are a liar.  You never paid attention to any of my previous threads, and I just proved once again that you are incompetent.  Seriously, how does it feel to be proven wrong?<br>
<br>
As far as no United States help for Israel post WWII.....you and Warangel1 should find something stating that U.S. never aided them....don't find me literature of what countries did aid them.  That's beside the point, anyway...the point is that no one should have helped them.  They can do things for themselves, apparently, the U.S. doesn't need to support them now, and never needed to support them then.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Apartheid....yeah....Palestinians live under occupation of Israelis.  South African natives lived under occupation of the Brits.  That might be a basic explanation, but it is an explanation nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Apparently with your logic, Mandela is also garbage, right?  Do you now, suddenly, hate blacks Kytherion?  Would not surprise me one bit.<br>
<br>
Make yourself look stupider, if it can be done.<br>
