<br>
I have been reading Dark Age of Camelot dev boards last couple of days and came across a couple of big threads about what type of PvP looting should be allowed in the game.<br>
<br>
The developers have stated there will be NO PvP item looting (maybe cash, still unknown) and it has been heartwarming to see the utter whining drivel that all the PK/grief players (although they try and pretend they are not) have been coming out with.<br>
<br>
For those who don’t know, there are 3 sides in DAOC and you cannot talk to or communicate with the other sides, also you CANNOT kill or attack people on ‘your’ side and newbie areas are in safe areas.<br>
<br>
Also when you kill someone from another side you will probably get their head which can be turned in for cash/rewards.  <br>
You also get a kind of Fame (realm points) for fighting against the other sides (kind of like UO Fame)<br>
You can also PvP any enemy at any time.<br>
<br>
Now to summarise what the PK/Grief shitheads out there always say.<br>
<br>
‘Oh its not about the LOOT, I PK for the thrill of the fight and maybe because I want to become infamous’ (sic)<br>
<br>
Well in DAOC these people can PK as MUCH AS THEY WANT, they can get FAMOUS while doing it and you get REWARDED for doing it too but guess what…..<br>
<br>
<br>
Yup that’s right, they are whining like mad over no item loot and that truly shows you that even when you give these people ALL the things they say they PK for, they were actually full of shit the whole time and they are just loot hungry Grief wankers.<br>
<br>
I may well try DAOC when it comes out, sure as hell wont be going to UO mark 2 AKA Shadowbane.<br>
<br>
Whats more the decent people who just want to have fun can all now laugh at the expense of the grief/pk tools as they rush onto SB for a unlimited pk lootfest.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, no matter what any PK’er says, they are in it for the loot and to try and make themselves feel like a ‘big man’, very often they also take HUGE pleasure in making their victim as miserable as possible even after they have killed them, a la killing people horses in UO.<br>
<br>
Who will do well in DAOC?  Anyone can, and casual players wont lose their gear when they die<br>
<br>
Who will do well in SB?  People with no life who can powerlevel for the first few months so as then to be in a position to PK everyone else with ease.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp and I fully expect the grief/loot whores out there to ‘’refute’’ me.<br>

People find fun in different things.  Those that are highly competitive will want trophies of their winnings.  If it gives them a thrill to PK or hog loot, then so be it.  You hating them because of what gives them pleasure is no different than them hating you for being a loudmouth and coming on a public message board to proclaim how righteous you are.<br>

<br>
I don't even want to start on this...but I'm sure you crosschecked every single author's post before posting this claim.  Nah, I just think you're being a righteous loudmouth.  BTW why don't you just look forward to going  to a pvp game and *killing* these people you hate so much?  <br>
<br>
&quot;I may well try DAOC when it comes out, sure as hell wont be going to UO mark 2 AKA Shadowbane.&quot;<br>
<br>
Please post which game/server you do choose when time comes, because we give a shit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats more the decent people who just want to have fun can all now laugh at the expense of the grief/pk tools as they rush onto SB for a unlimited pk lootfest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then those people aren't decent.  I'd say more along the lines of spiteful pissy righteous loudmouths that get pleasure out of watching other people get disappointed.  Do you take pleasure in having things go your way (such as this loot situation) so you feel like a 'big man' and take pleasure in making your opposition as miserable as possible even after the debate is done with by flaming them here?  Oh, read next quote from Mitch:<br>
<br>
&quot;At the end of the day, no matter what any PK’er says, they are in it for the loot and to try and make themselves feel like a ‘big man’, very often they also take HUGE pleasure in making their victim as miserable as possible even after they have killed them, a la killing people horses in UO.&quot;<br>
<br>
Does spamming duel challenges in east commons open to any melee lower level than you count as being in it to make yourself feel like a 'big man'?  Belittling them because of their inferior equipment is not only patronizing but oh &quot;very often they also take HUGE pleasure in making their victim as miserable as possible&quot; the life of a hypocrite.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Who will do well in DAOC? Anyone can, and casual players wont lose their gear when they die&quot;<br>
<br>
Woohoo I'm gonna be a casual player so I can raid enemy factions and not lose any items when they kill me.  Anyone can do well in EQ - but there will always be a rift between the casual and power gamers.  To take out that rift requires too many limitations.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who will do well in SB? People with no life who can powerlevel for the first few months so as then to be in a position to PK everyone else with ease.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have no life but still suck at EQ.  I don't find it will be any different in any other game.  Your point?  Oh, probably just another opportunity to insult people again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just my 2cp and I fully expect the grief/loot whores out there to ‘’refute’’ me.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I am just 1) a pathetic loser 2) 24 year old that eats off paper plates because i'm too damn lazy to wash dishes and 3) someone that can't stand anyone that thinks they're the shit.<br>

What is your opponents head if not a trophy<br>
<br>
''If it gives them a thrill to PK or hog loot, then so be it. You hating them because of what gives them pleasure is no different than them hating you for being a loudmouth and coming on a public message board to proclaim how righteous you are.''<br>
<br>
Firstly its my opinion, secondly its shared by (if you believe the many surveys) the huge overwhelming majority of online gamers, now just because 9 out of 10 people think you're wrong does not make you wrong per se, but hmm...<br>
<br>
''BTW why don't you just look forward to going to a pvp game and *killing* these people you hate so much? ''<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to going to a PvP game, DAOC.  Only difference is that the grief players, which you obviously are, wont be able to ruin weeks of someones work by takign someones gear and do crap like corpse camping<br>
<br>
''Please post which game/server you do choose when time comes, because we give a shit.''<br>
<br>
Why respond then? duh<br>
<br>
''Then those people aren't decent. I'd say more along the lines of spiteful pissy righteous loudmouths that get pleasure out of watching other people get disappointed. ''<br>
<br>
Disappointed? i suppose they might be, although they can still go to Sb and prey on newbies all day long, and yes i AM  VERY pleased that a developer has taken steps to integrate PvP (which i enjoy btw) into a meaningul setting whilst eliminating grief wankers like yourself.<br>
<br>
''Does spamming duel challenges in east commons open to any melee lower level than you count as being in it to make yourself feel like a 'big man'?''<br>
<br>
Yes I often ask for duels in EC from melee chars 50+, its called passing the time with some light relief fool.<br>
<br>
''Belittling them because of their inferior equipment is not only patronizing but oh &quot;very often they also take HUGE pleasure in making their victim as miserable as possible&quot; the life of a hypocrite. ''<br>
<br>
You were stating your opinions up to here, which is cool, we all have one.  However here you just lied. naughty.  I have not, dont, and never will, belittle anyone due to their equipment (unless its a guildie take the piss out of the Rangers session).  Making things up makes you look stupid, i'd reccomend against it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Woohoo I'm gonna be a casual player so I can raid enemy factions and not lose any items when they kill me. Anyone can do well in EQ - but there will always be a rift between the casual and power gamers. To take out that rift requires too many limitations.''<br>
<br>
Well lets see how well they pull it off, after all the causal gamers are the ones who pay the bills so if i was a developer i'd say screw the power gamers anyway.<br>
<br>
''No, I am just 1) a pathetic loser 2) 24 year old that eats off paper plates because i'm too damn lazy to wash dishes and 3) someone that can't stand anyone that thinks they're the shit.''<br>
<br>
And you think I care?<br>

Therefore it would be unimaginable if you could lose it by a PvP death.<br>
<br>
As I've already said many times, true PvP games aren't as loot based as EverQuest is. If loot isn't hard to come by, it won't matter much if it's easy to lose as well. As weird as it may sound, but that's why I love the UO PvP.<br>
<br>
I rather have the excitement of getting killed by a 10 year old grief d00d then the &quot;excitement&quot; of &quot;will the Pearl Kedge Totem drop in my next 12 hour camp?&quot;.<br>
<br>
That's why I think DAoC will be an EQ clone (which I don't consider as a good thing), and Shadowbane will be THE shit. Half of the folks flaming UO never actually played the game, because the game *is* good.<br>
<br>

<br>
In UO when i played you could go out in player made plate and weapons which cost a couple k total and if you died it really was no biggie but thats AFTER you had those first few weeks of learning the game and getting pk'ed when losing even one bit of equipment did matter to you.<br>
<br>
Thats why there should always be safe newbie ares in PvP games.<br>
<br>
You are wrong about loot being the methhod of advancement in DAOC though, all the stuff you'll be using with very few exceptions will be player made and level + relam points will be how people are measured.<br>
<br>
'Most' Pk's have always said they wanted:<br>
<br>
Unrestricted combat<br>
A monetary/item reward for killing the other guy<br>
Some kind of fame/infamy reward<br>
<br>
Well DAOC gives all those but now we see what everyone else knew all along, what the majority of PK's really want it:<br>
<br>
The ability to ruin someones day<br>
To take all your hard earned gear and taunt you about losing it<br>
<br>
And DAOC does not give them that, well TOUGH SHIT grief players, my heart bleeds for you but dont worry you can all go play SB /bye<br>

Even going to the bank with what little money you have, there were constant pick pockets that would steal what little money or items you have.

I like the idea that PvP is there but is not mandatory.  You can go through the entire game without ever seeing a single opponent from another Realm if you choose or as you advance in level you can join in the larger battle and PvP to your hearts content.  I like the fact that death in PvP is NOT going to cost me anything.  It’s good to hear that I won’t lose my massive sword of uberness and dragon smiting that I spent months to acquire to another player who spent 5 seconds nuking the crap out of me.  DAOC seems to be a game that is very concerned with making a game that customers want to play.  There are a lot of things that look to be similar to EQ, but they also seem to be trying their hardest to eliminate the most frustrating and stupid things EQ forces us to endure.<br>
<br>
Shadowbane scares me a bit to be honest.  I might very well pick it up and give it a try but I’m afraid at the rampant number of grief players and PKers that are going to play this game.  It all depends on how bad it is and if there is a way to avoid it (i.e. no PvP in certain safe areas).  An entire game built around PvP is intimidating to me.  I play these games for fun, not so a 12 year-old snot can get his jollies off of  killing me over and over again.  Shadowbane sounds neat in concept, but the game is going to be dictated by those who play it.  Therefore, I’ll see if the game is any good and then decide if I want to spend my money on it.  I’m just afraid that the power-gamer I)o0dz are going to run rampant in this game and ruin it for anyone who wants to be a casual player.<br>
<br>
That seems to be the difference right now.  Shadowbane is geared towards power gamers where DAOC is geared towards casual players.<br>
<br>
But then again, I could be totally wrong.  What do I know?<br>

In addition to validating themselves is this way they <br>
always seek the 'edge' (whatever the edge happenes to be)<br>

In most cases (example UO) that involves being able to do something your opponent cannot do: <br>

The fact that the newbie areas will be quite safe and people will be able to get to the desired level before going for pvp makes it more likely that there will be large scale battles - I for one will be far more likely to get heavily involved in pvp battles if I know I'm not going to lose all my stuff.  Since you will only be attacked in pvp areas generally except for large scale invasions you won't have to worry about loner grief pk's since they will find it a tad difficult to get past border guards on their own.  There is no point in farming equipment if you are hugely over the level of the mob - if you want the equipment, you get it at the level it is designed for (weapons degrade quite quickly if they are used to twink someone), so if you are say level 20 and are getting equipment meant for your level, then you are fighting stuff that gives you exp as well - you'll never see a high level camping some newbie mob for stuff...</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#575757><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubizzo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bizzo</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Veteran</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>86</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>4/12/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>11:54:47 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: DAOC, SB, Grief players and Loot</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">&quot;What is your opponents head if not a trophy&quot;<br>

The same was said for EQ by UO casual players.  The 'next big thing' will always look promising if you feed off one issue.  But no matter what, there will always be something other people can and will do to you that spoils your fun.  Me claiming to know DAoC's shortcomings are just as silly as you claiming to know DAoC's perfection.  BTW, what makes you accuse me of being a grief player?  Arguing against you?  Nowhere did anything in my post say anything about my playing styles, so yet again you're making a stretch to claim something in an attempt to belittle others.  Isn't that a quality you just *hate*?<br>
<br>
&quot;''Please post which game/server you do choose when time comes, because we give a shit.''<br>
Why respond then? duh&quot; <br>
<br>
To let you know that if UFO's landed on earth, they wouldn't ask to speak to you.<br>

&quot;Disappointed? i suppose they might be, although they can still go to Sb and prey on newbies all day long, and yes i AM VERY pleased that a developer has taken steps to integrate PvP (which i enjoy btw) into a meaningul setting whilst eliminating grief wankers like yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Odd, you just described *yourself* as a grief wanker.  Get the point of my post yet?<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I often ask for duels in EC from melee chars 50+, its called passing the time with some light relief fool.&quot;<br>
<br>
BTW, if killing people you consider &quot;light relief fools&quot; is a passtime for you...then again you just painted yourself as what you hated.  Coming on here and calling your victims light relief fools counts as belittling.<br>
<br>
&quot;You were stating your opinions up to here, which is cool, we all have one. However here you just lied. naughty. I have not, dont, and never will, belittle anyone due to their equipment (unless its a guildie take the piss out of the Rangers session). Making things up makes you look stupid, i'd reccomend against it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Making things up?  That's exactly what you did in your original post (X players said they wanted this for pvp but later these same X players got mad because of no looting).  Yep it does make you look stupid, I'm sure you'd recommend doing against what you did.  BTw how did I lie?  I'd be lying if I said &quot;mitch challenges anyone with inferior equipment to a duel&quot; which I didn't say.  Another hollow accusation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well lets see how well they pull it off, after all the causal gamers are the ones who pay the bills so if i was a developer i'd say screw the power gamers anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep agreed, I'd like to see how they pull it off as DAoC is the one i'm favoring as well.  But unfortunately power gamers also pay their bills and will populate *all* games.  Lots of power gamers started off as casual players anyway, as has been shown by EQ.  I don't think you honestly wanted to say &quot;screw the power gamers anyway&quot; because you'd be disorienting the people in higher guilds (including yourself) and instead wanted to focus your spite towards grief players like in your original post.  <br>
<br>

You are in one of 3 realms. In your realm you cannot pk another of your own realm. You can in fact level up without fear of pk until you reach higher level and only then if you want to level fast which would require you to hunt in the borderlands. You can raid and PK with a group, yourself, or a large invasion force. The object being to 'count coup' on your enemies. You will be able to return to your realm with the heads of your enemies and get fame points via turning them in. Fame points translate to more power on your character and titles. Titles however come with responsibilities (see later). A person who does not carry the fight for their people to another country will not be as powerful as one that does.<br>
<br>
Weapons and Armor will be less camped as most of the really good stuff seems to be made by blacksmiths of each race/realm. Smithing as a trade skill will be very viable because you can purchase very good items from a smith for x anount of money. Similiar items may be found on monsters but it seems clear that Mythic wants to avoid the long camps of EQ with a passion. I agree.<br>
<br>
They seem to be trying to balance the classes so that no race/class combo gives an advantage over another, just different skills. For example: A nordic skald(bard) will be more combat orientated and not as good at song spells, whereas A celtic bard will be more half and half and a human minstrel will be more rogue-ish with heavy emphasis on songs. Classes should actually be useful in the large scale combats which should happen.<br>
<br>
Now the cool thing is that this is set in a 'known' fanatasy realm. Post-arthurian Camelot, with the realms that Arthur kept at bay slowly encroaching on England. You have relics to protect from these invaders, housed in defensive keeps. They haven't elaborated exactly what bonuses and negatives you receive if you gain/lose these relics but I would suspect that your realm as a whole would be a little weaker for a time or until you get the item back. What this means is; you have people who ,based on their fame in foreign combat, are placed in positions of authority such as defender of the realm etc. these people are your warleaders, and can gather large armies to invade other lands to take their relics or retrieve your own. The zones are transparent so there is no loading please wait. You could be defending your keep, maybe smithing to build some money in the meantime, when a runner comes up and reports that the Norsemen have invaded. You could see across the horizon and see the Norse forces slowly appearing as you shout out the call to arms and gather your troops.<br>
<br>
That, imho would be AWESOME. It would also lead me to believe that if someone was causing a large internal ruckus that, even though they might not be normally killable, a ranked person could sentence them to death with no prayer to return half xp or maybe even conscript/imprison them. Have to see more about that as the betas progress.<br>
<br>
And I am not knocking Shadowbane. They will have a large scale combat between cities or whatever they divide a realm into. If I am not mistaken, don't they also have semi safe areas for newbies to hunt or at least orientate themselves first? The graphic interface is not one i personally like, but thats personal preference. I would suggest that people try both before they knock one or the other. Really, try each and pick the one you like.  <br>

In EQ and the other D&amp;D/DIKU muds that it was based on fighter types have always been more item dependant than casters, and in a full loot situation they tend to be at a disadvantage as they are almost invariably useless when naked.<br>

God, I hope it helps you in your reading skills. Lets get to my first point.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sure people go to lguk for the froglok tongues.&quot;<br>
<br>
The difference between a Froglog tongue and the head of a player is this. The froglok spawns every 17 minutes or so, is a CPU controlled character, and is completely different from your character in how its skills work. A player character can think (in most cases, you're one of the exceptions), is on the same playing field as you in terms of what he can or cannot do (IE, a human enchanter ahs the same strengths as another human enchanter, as opposed to a CPU enchanter that has HP and attack like a warrior and more mana than you). So earning a player's head is more of an achievment than killing a_Froglok_001.<br>

You were the one being called a grief wanker. I won't go into why, as I don't feel the same way (you really dont seem like a grief PKer to me, but...), however, this insult was aimed at you. The original poster was not insulting himself/herself.<br>
<br>
Next...<br>
<br>
&quot;BTW, if killing people you consider &quot;light relief fools&quot; is a passtime for you...then again you just painted yourself as what you hated. Coming on here and calling your victims light relief fools counts as belittling.&quot;<br>
<br>
A comma was meant in there, still, it's not hard to see the point of the poster. &quot;Some light relife, fool&quot; as in, the poster was looking for some light relief, and you are a fool for criticizing him/her for this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Making things up? That's exactly what you did in your original post&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, wrong. It is true that most PKers in general are like this, and Mitch was just commening on that. She did not say EVERYONE was like that. Also, you don't deny that you made up shit about her. No surprise there, as you're seeming more and more like an idiot as I continue to read your post (thats right, I decided to respond after reading your first 2 points).<br>

I will play it... but i am not into PK.  I like PVP almost nill.  I like it when there is some &quot;greater purpose&quot; behind it... oh god she is a roleplayer!  Yes, DAoC PVP really sounds like what i am looking for.  I can imagin being in hyberina(sp) chatting with friends and suddenly the cry goes out &quot;The brittons are coming the brittons are coming!&quot;  and rushing off to defend my realm.  <br>
<br>
Likewise, if i dont want to get PKed, i dont have to go.<br>
<br>
SB is kewl in that you get to soul bind (or something) 3 of your &quot;best&quot; items to yourself.  So you wont loose that really hard fought item that you got somehow.  So that is kewl.  I think alot of people, especially me, will be running around without a whole lot of equipment. (and visiting the bank frequently <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) But the thing i detest in games like SB is i am fighting some critter, having fun and some &quot;god&quot; character comes allong and blasts me when i am down.  (as if they needed me to be half beat up)  Thats annoying as heck.  I will probably leave cloth armor and a few cp on the corpse and the couple decent things i have respawn with me.  But then said fool gloats over his &quot;victory&quot; like he actually did something.  It just gets frustrating and is the reason i dislike PVP.  <br>
<br>
We had a ball as the &quot;newbie vengence squad&quot; on RZ.  was low level, nothing to loose and go hunt some people.  it was fun.  I know i will play SB cuz it looks too good to just let waste away on the shelf... but i doubt that i will put any serious time into it, like i expect to in DAoC.  (unless oggy or someone loveable wants to protect little ole me fer a while till i can take care of myself.  I am SURE when i play SB i will join a very big, powerful guild for protection rather than try to RP in a smaller guild the way i always did in eq)</font><P><a href="http://www.geocities.com/e_darrain/"><img src="http://fp.geocities.com/e_darrain/img0.gif" border="0"></a><br> I, Mistress Ezra Darkreign, reserve the right to ramble on, speak incoherently, make spelling errors and other such mistakes when posting.<P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#575757><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukizmetbayashi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kizmet Bayashi</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Veteran</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>249</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>4/12/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>7:37:47 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: DAOC, SB, Grief players and Loot</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">  After reading this entire thread all I can say is that Wolf pack has stated in certain terms &quot;their game will not be for everyone&quot; if this sort of open PVP is not for you THEN DONT PLAY!<br>
<br>
 Mitch before condemning a game that we know Oh so very little about I think you might need to wait for some more info.<br>
<br>
 and to genneralize every person who like open pvp with looting as a greif player seems a bit harsh.<br>
