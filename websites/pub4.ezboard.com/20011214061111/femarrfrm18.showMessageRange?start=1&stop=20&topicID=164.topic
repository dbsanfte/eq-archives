Where the hell do you think the Canadians will be? Probably the same place as the British...fighting right along side us. How you could even conceive of holding your head up in a country fighting YOUR war  is beyond me.<br>

If you were brave, you'd refuse to fight and serve your time in jail. It's the law, it's been that way since the day you were born. Now you want to opt out because one of your fucking video games might turn real.<br>

This struggle is not new, and the issues have not sprung up overnight.  Our seeming willingness to lash out with absolutely no sense of what the hell we're doing is what's new.

Listen carefully. This is America. No one cares what you do. Waste your life, fuck around, be successful or don't. How you spend your life is your business, a freedom that many men and a few women have died for.<br>
<br>
Except for one thing. When they call you to fight, you go. <br>
<br>
You don't theorize, you don't rationalize, you don't proclaim your opinion and think that gives you an out. You don't point cleverly at what the TV has told you regarding the strategy of the war that hasn't even happened yet, and think you should get to stay.<br>
<br>
I don't like Bush myself, you smarmy little rodent, but that doesn't change the nature of my citizenship, or the responsibility that goes with it. <br>
<br>
Go and fight, or stay and go to prison. Or leave and never come back. One rule, and you've known it since the day you had to register. When you signed up, it didn't mean you would get drafted if you felt like it. It meant you'd get drafted when your country needed you.<br>
<br>
I know pacifists that will stay and protest, and serve their time, if it comes to that. You, on the other hand, will run like the rat you are. But for the love of all that is holy, don't inflict yourself on the Canadians. The cowardly filth you've posted here is humiliating enough.<br>

Gladetree, you think you are living FREELY in the United States and no one suffered so that you may do so?  Go watch Saving Private Ryan and get a *glimpse* of what Americans have gone through to ensure your rights to be posting shallow remarks such as yours.  You live FREELY because others have given their LIVES for it.  <br>

We all take for granted our military, police, fireman and other organizations that sacrifice daily to help the lives of others.  <br>

Where the hell did you people get these ideas?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This country was made strong by the patriotism and selfless service to their country.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is bullshit. This country was made strong by capitalism and all its implications (read: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> freedom</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->). America was founded because all the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> other</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> countries were based on that sort of &quot;sacrifice yourself to everyone else&quot; shit. This country wasn't founded on communism. Americans are not born to serve. People were meant to have rights, and the definition of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> right</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> does <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> end with a footnote saying, &quot;until and unless the majority says otherwise.&quot; When a man enlists to fight a war, he fights because the country he's fighting for is great and he will die rather than accept anything less.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No one's even said the word &quot;draft&quot; yet, and you're making reservations in fucking Canada.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Just because no one's said it doesn't mean it's not a real possibility. Leaving something unnamed doesn't negate its existence.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How you could even conceive of holding your head up in a country fighting YOUR war is beyond me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What Glade said: this is not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> war. I'm sorry about what happened in New York. I think the people who orchestrated it should be killed. But I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> don't</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> want to risk <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> life to head out and fight some ambiguous enemy in order to help the large mass referred to as the &quot;American public&quot; feel like everything is being resolved.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What will you say when the first Canadian widow asks you where you're from? Will you even have the courage to apologize for your shame?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'll tell her I came to Canada because the US government was trying to revoke my right to live.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you were brave, you'd refuse to fight and serve your time in jail. It's the law, it's been that way since the day you were born.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Sorry, I don't buy into that whole &quot;If it's been around this long, it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can't</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be wrong!&quot; thing. I also don't believe that the judgement of the people running our government is infallible.<br>
<br>
I think it's sick for a &quot;free country&quot; to be so full of people who would want to force others to fight for them. I'm happy for the people who gladly sign up. They do it of their own will. But I'll be damned if I'll accept this government forcing people to fight for them (again, even!); all it does is turn people into slaves. Do you think the drafted soldiers are going to feel any kind of fiery will to fight for a country that just shoved them out onto a battlefield to be cannon fodder?<br>
<br>
I wonder how this country can possibly have meaning and value for the people who don't think people shouldn't have rights. There is no such thing as &quot;limited freedom&quot; - a man is either free or he isn't, and before you say it, I'm well aware that this government says otherwise. Are you going to tell me to get out of this country then, if I won't fight a bunch of people in the Arabic region for what you call &quot;the people?&quot;<br>
<br>
I will not go out to fight this (or any) war until it is apparent that freedom as a country's policy will be overthrown without the added effort. My life and future are worth far too much to me. There is already a horde of those who <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> eager to go fight, and I send the best of wishes out to those people. However, no matter what the circumstances: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>I do not recognize anyone's right to force me to fight for them, and I would die rather than be forced to fight for anyone who thinks otherwise</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=50436"><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triff01.jpg" alt="Click for my EQCastersrealm profile" align="left" border=0></a><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/duel.gif" alt="rofl..

I heard him quite clearly. <br>
<br>
And at the age of sixteen, he signed up for the Selective Service. Same as me, same as you. If his country is at war...<br>
<br>
...THEN IT IS HIS WAR. And if it isn't his war, it isn't his country.<br>

Capitalism made us strong, did it? Good thing we know how to honor our contracts. Or at least, some of us do.<br>
<br>
You eat at the restaraunt, you pay the bill. This fucker's talking about sneaking out the back without paying, so you'll have to excuse me if I take exception.<br>

You accept what is given you and assume it your due, but the moment the time comes where you might have to fight for your right to live free, you run like the immature shit you are.<br>
<br>
You are correct, you have the freedom to make your own decision on whether you give up your right or not.  Trust me, though.  We know what kind of men you really are.<br>

First, he is wrong to think that Canada would even grant him asylum. He would be turned away and have to either enlist or go to jail IF there is a draft. Second, this WAR is everyone's war who live in the WEST or democratic EAST. If they could destroy the WTC then they can destroy other symbols of democracy! Other democratic governments outside the USA are not immune to terrorism! Finally, if your ass doesn't want to sign up Triff then don't do it. It is your choice. However, don't sing in the steets with the victors. Cowards always look for the way out with reason. It is the brave who move forward in defense of their loved ones and conquer.<br>

The problem is expressed with your quote Triff. We ought to fight when it is obvious that the next man or woman doesn't have the right to live free as we do. You have a luxury.
