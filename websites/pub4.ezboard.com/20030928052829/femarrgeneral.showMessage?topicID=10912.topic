I hear some people have found PoP at Wal-Mart today.<br>
<br>
I assume its a west coast thing, but on the off chance... I call my local Wal-Mart.<br>
<br>
Me: Can I speak with someone that handles computer software<br>
Employee_1: Sure, please hold.<br>
......<br>
<br>
Employee_2: Hello electronics (same department as software)<br>
Me: Hello, I was wondering if you had Everquest: Planes of Power in stock.<br>
Employee_2: Yup, sure do<br>
Me: Are you sure?  There are several expansions and this one just came out.  (tone: mixed glee and doubt)<br>
Employee_2: Yeah, I am looking right at the display.<br>
Me: Okay, just making sure because most places don't have it till tommorrow.  (getting car keys)<br>
Employee_2: You are in luck then, because we have been selling them all morning.<br>
<br>
Okay... let me pause here for dramatic effect.  I just know you can't guess the following turn of events.<br>
<br>
I arrive at the store, walking slowly cause I am out of breath (have a chest cold that accompanied the fever).  I head back to electronics and see a big empty display.  I ask, &quot;are you all sold out of Planes of Power.&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay.. again... dramatic effect... guess the response.<br>
<br>
Employee_3_Probably_Same_As_Employee_2: &quot;That doesn't come in till tommorrow.&quot;<br>
Me: (stunned silence)<br>
<br>
So, now I walk over to CS and ask for a manager.  <br>
<br>
Me: I don't feel well, that isn't your fault, but I called ahead so that I wouldn't have to drive all over town, and that is your fault.  Not you as in Michael (his name) but you as in your store.<br>
Manager: Well, they shouldn't have told you it was in<br>
Me: DUH.<br>
Manager: Our release date is Tuesday<br>
Me: If they told me that on the phone then we wouldn't have this problem. It is not my fault as a consumer to keep track of your release dates, even if it was... that is why I called.<br>
Manager: If we sell it early they will pull our licence.<br>
Me: Thats nice, but how is that the issue?<br>
Manager: Do you know who you talked to?<br>
Me: No, sorry, I didn't think to start a personal relationship with your employees.<br>
Manager: Well sorry, in the future just be aware we release on Tuesdays.<br>
Me: Okay, and be aware that tommorrow I am going to drive past your store and buy this game somewhere where they value customers.<br>
Manager: thats fine (all this while he was stacking boxes, can tell I had a real effect on him)<br>
<br>
<br>
I get home pretty mad, not just at the error but at the handling of it.  I start to look up corporate info but then decide to call the store and talk directly to the store manager.  I get him on the phone and tell him the story.  He is appalled, which any true store manager should.  He said &quot;My name is Sean, I will be in all day tommorrow, make sure to stop by and pick up your free copy.&quot;<br>
<br>
So Sean, thanks for making my day.  I wasn't going to buy 2 copies for my accounts, but after that... I am gonna go ahead and buy the 2nd copy just to throw some business his way. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

<br>
I work 3rd shift in a different town. I get off in the early morning. So, since there is no real place to buy recent release stuff in my town I stop by Wal Mart after work because I am over there and it is the only place open that early.<br>
<br>
Show up to get Sopranos season 3 the day of release.<br>
<br>
Me: Umm excuse me sir, do you work in electronics.<br>
Him: (looks confused)<br>
Me: Umm i was wondering about DVD's<br>
Him: Oh they are over there.<br>
Me: (i am standing by the display) Yes I see that. I was wondering if you were getting The Sopranos in.<br>
Him: (tilts his head as if letting brain sfift to other side of head) Umm, I don't know.<br>
Me: Ok is there anybody here who does?<br>
Him: (tilts head further) I can look on the invoice.<br>
Me: Ok please.<br>
Him: Yeah, Its coming in Tuesday <br>
Me: (it is tuesday 6:30 am) Next tuesday?<br>
Him: This tuesday. At midnight.<br>
Me: You mean Wednesday?<br>
Him: (looking at me like I no longer speak English) No tuesday is release date.<br>
Me: Today?<br>
Him: Yeah <br>
Me: So you got a copy in?<br>
Him: Yeah, in back<br>
Me: Can I have it?<br>
Him: No, not till tuesday.<br>
Me: What TIME on tuesday?<br>
Him: Midnight we can sell them.<br>
Me: You mean midnight tonight?<br>
Him: Yeah when it is Tuesday.<br>
Me: It is tuesday morning.<br>
Him: Sorry man, its not released yet. Not till tuesday<br>
Me: What time on tuesday. Noon?<br>
Him: Well right after midnight. <br>
Me: Would 6 1/2 hours after midnight work?<br>
Him: If its still in we are only getting one copy.<br>
Me: So... umm... It's tuesday. Right now. But I can't get it till after midnight? So wouldn't that be Wednesday?<br>
Him: No (now i get the helping the slow look) Tuesday midnight.<br>
Me: So when exactly does Wednesday start for you? <br>
Him: Tomorrow.<br>
Me: Well Thanks anyway.<br>
Him: No problem. Anything else I can help you with.<br>
Me: (feeling the spirit of Tony Soprano) Yeah, do you sell guns here? (Immediatley feel bad for having evil thoughts) <br>
Him: (Finally looking excited about his job) Sure do! You want me to show you some?<br>
Me: (Looks at bare wrist) No, I got to be going.<br>
Him: Ok man well sorry I couldn't help you.<br>
Me: Sorry I couldn't help you either.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a side note the manager and an employee were fired from Wal Mart when showing someone a gun that next week and it went off putting a hole in the roof. I cringed for an hour.<br>

<br>
But, <br>
<br>
If the release date isn't until the 22nd, how can you expect him to sell it to you? I agree he should have found out who you spoke to on the phone, apologized for the misunderstanding, and tried to find somewhat of a reasonable alternative, but he has to abide by the store regulations as much as anyone else, regardless of the stupidity of his employees.<br>
<br>
That's what I know anyway. Then again, I've never worked anything involving software. Maybe it wouldn't have hurt to sell it to you.<br>
<br>
But maybe people would use the same excuse to get the game a day early.... you know Hothgar would. He's that evil.<br>
<br>
Just something to keep in mind,<br>

I was mad, and I wanted to feel like something was going to be done to keep this from happening in the future.  Seeing as my fever came back tonight it seems I wasn't well yet and was probably meaner than I would normally be. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

I got a copy of PoP for myself from a friend who works at Frye's Electronics as a gift cuz he knew that I am a player/addict. So I went back up there today to get a copy for my brother who also plays. When I get there I run into a 16 year old kid who knows everything in the world about gaming. <br>
<br>
Me - Hi, do you have any copies of Planes of Power?<br>
Him - &lt;wrinkles up his face&gt; Sure do, lemme show ya. <br>
<br>
We walk over to the place where it is and he points it out. <br>
<br>
Me- Thx alot.<br>
Him- You should really think about playing something else other then EQ.<br>
Me- Why is that?<br>
Him- EQ sucks, you should try Dark Ages of Chamelot or wait for the new Star Wars if you like roleplaying games. EQ is a horrible game. <br>
Me- Thx but I think I will stick with this. Been playing for 3 years kinda hard just to walk away from it. <br>
Him - 3 years?!? Damn you have wasted alot of money and time. I guess you dont like challenging games, EQ is very easy and too many cheaters.<br>
Me- Sounds like you are talking about UO and not EQ.<br>
Him - &lt;laughing&gt; UO is a far better game dude. <br>
<br>
At this point I was so irritated with his demeanor and attitude I just had to walk away, especially after using the &quot;dude&quot; word. /cringe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubumblefumble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bumblefumble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/22/02 2:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10912.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Uh, yea</span><hr size=1> what do you expect at a walmart?<br>
