 In Texas, a death penalty case costs an average of $2.3 million, about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years. (Dallas Morning News, March 8, 1992).<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There ya go - it costs more.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 In this study, author William Bailey speculated that if executions had a deterrent effect in Oklahoma, it would be observable by comparing murder rates and rates of sub-types of murder, such as felony-murder, stranger robbery-related killings, stranger non-felony murder, and argument-related killings, before and after the resumption of executions. Bailey examined the period between 1989 and 1991 for total killings and sub-types of killing. After controlling for a number of variables, Bailey found that there was no evidence for a deterrent effect. He did, however, find that there was a significant increase in stranger killings and non-felony stranger killings after Oklahoma resumed executions after a 25-year moratorium. (36 Criminology 711-33 (199 ). <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There ya go - it does not have a deterrence effect - if anything all it does is make our society more barbaric and apt to call for 'vengance' upon the convicted.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
The number of innocent defendants released from death row has been steadily increasing over recent years. Between 1973 and October, 1993, there was an average of 2.75 innocent defendants released. Since then, the average has increased to 5 released per year. <br>
<br>
Total Exonerations Since 1973: 101 <br>
<br>
Exonerations in 2002: 3 <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And there ya go - innocent people are convicted and put on death row all the time - who knows how many are dead now - no one - because the dead tell no tales.<br>

You have presented two things: either a SUBSET of data or opinion. The texas thing? Subset of data considering there are 50 states. While the data you present does give merit to your argument it hardly makes it fact as you state. Is it a fact in Texas at present? Sure it is. Is it a fact anywhere else? Who knows, you sure dont. Could this fact be changed? Absolutely. Without the exhaustive appeals process a death penalty case would cost about as much as it would to keep someone in jail for a year or two. <br>

As for the deterence factor? For the love of sh1t man do you not read what you yourself is posting? The study the man did was based on spculative evidence. How do I know this? CAUSE YOU PUT THE WORD SPECULATE IN YOUR DAMN EXERPT YOU FVCKING GENIUS. The entire study is based on the assumption that the evidence proves his theory, thereby making the entire study an assumption. Once again, while the study does lend credibility to your argument it doesnt make it fact? Cant you understand that? Does it hurt when you think?<br>
<br>
As for the innocent people being killed? Sure, thats not something I dispute now nor have I once in this thread. In comparison however you did indeed state quite a few more things as fact that you know you have nothing to support and thats why you have not. Allow me to requote you so you can remember things which you state as fact and are quite clearly not. <br>

I've watched this thread and watched supposed &quot;facts&quot; be deemed opinions. In return these opinions are countered with more &quot;facts&quot; that are really just opinions that have been written into the letter of the law.<br>
<br>
Example : Some are saying that it is a fact that by executing the death penalty you are comminting murder. Others are saying that it is not murder because it is a legally santioned kill.<br>
<br>
They're both opinions. The second statement is no truer then the first just because society says so.<br>

<br>
It is always a fact that if you kill an innocent man with pre-meditation then you have commited murder. <br>
<br>
This is not the only problem with the death penalty - it *IS* 100% fact that it costs more in every state to kill a man than to keep him locked up.  It is currently the OPINION (no I'm tired of arguing this so here it goes) of most of the world and academic circles that the death penalty does not deter crime.  Those studies based on scientific evidence that have done thier own research have not found any evidence that would show deterrence - and many times the findings would suggest otherwise.<br>
<br>
Is this a problem with the system?  If you like living in the United States it's one you have to accept.  We do try to maintain &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; and &quot;It is better to release 100 guilty men - than imprison 1 innocent&quot;.  Those are the ideals that our leagal system was built on - if you don't like it too bad.  Those statements (in my OPINION) should speak volumes about how the death penalty is applied (ie NEVER).<br>
<br>

That's a very wishy/washy statement.  Muder is a word invented by society - all words are invented and given meaning - all facts/opinions/truth is invented by humans.  We, at one time, believed the world to be flat - it was considered fact.  Society has alot ot say about truth and what is fact.<br>
<br>
There is nothing that is gained by killing someone over putting them in prison for the rest of thier lives, other than vengance perhaps.<br>
<br>
But it still boils down to the fact that I think that the death penalty is murder.  That is because my in my opinion, there is no such thing as leagalised killing.<br>

<br>
A person put to death has ZERO potential to committ another crime.<br>
<br>
A person given &quot;life without parole&quot; can still kill again, and some do.  Granted, it may be fellow inmates that get killed, but murder is still murder.<br>
<br>
A person given a number of years, or &quot;life&quot; has the potential to get out of prison.  Once out, they have the ability to kill again.<br>
<br>
If you actually believe that ZERO convicted murderers EVER kill again, then you could make the claim that death penalty doesn't prevent crime.  But the reality is the some do kill again, whether in prison or out in the community doesn't really matter.  <br>
<br>
As far as the $$ required to put a convicted murderer to death in Texas, it does seem like an outrageous amount.  But compare that amount to how much your families members life is worth.   Every time one of these convicted murderers kills again it is someone's family member, whether it be a fellow inmate, prison guard or just someone walking down the street. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uckorikkatorath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ckorik Katorath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/22/02 12:07:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3475.topic&index=116>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you actually believe that ZERO convicted murderers EVER kill again, then you could make the claim that death penalty doesn't prevent crime.

<br>
If someone kills someone else in prison that is a faliure of the prison system.<br>
<br>
According to that argument all people convicted of a crime should be put to death, so that they might never commit another crime.<br>
<br>
Ther are innocent people in jail - there are criminals that get out of jail and never commit another crime - that doesn't make it valid to say that all criminals should be let go either.<br>
<br>
Deterance is not the prevention of people commiting the same crime again - it is preventing someone from commiting the crime in the first place.<br>
<br>
It doesn't take alot of thought to realise that if people thought they would be caught that they would still commit the crime.  People do not think they will be caught - thus the punishment doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
Do you think that public decapitation or hangings prevented crime back when they happened?  People still commited crime then - they do now.<br>

What if your family member was convicted of a crime and killed for it - then later they find out the entire thing was a setup due to corrupt police work due to pressure of getting 'someone' so that they look good (has happened).  How much is your family members life in that case?<br>
<br>
I'd rather spend a ton of money keeping someone locked away for the rest of thier natural life (in a case like this little girls rapist) than spend the money on killing someone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1994<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/22/02 12:12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3475.topic&index=117>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Ckorik, you can't have the best of both worlds.
