I sent an email of complaint to &quot;eqmail@verant.com; beconomy@soe.sony.com; eqcs@verant.com&quot;. Does anyone have any other addreses?<br>
<br>
Retyped from screenshots:<br>
Kaikachi: greetings, gm kaikachi here. how can i help you?<br>
me: we are hunting dragons in ww.<br>
me: while we were randoming, medicus ninjaloted a neck.<br>
me: she is not part of our guild raid and not in on the kill.<br>
Kaikachi: well, i'm afraid that if the corpse was left long enough for it to be open for anyone to loot that it was not a &quot;ninja&quot; loot. in fact, it was something that can occur, that you have to be aware of.<br>
me: umm, we were randoming it, it was a multi party kill.<br>
Kaikachi: i'm afraid it makes no diference. if the corpse is allowed to sit long enough so that it becomes open to loot, then anyone that loots it has the right to do so.<br>
me: um, yes it does, does that mena that<br>
me: um, yes it does, does that mean that i can go do a naggy raid and speed click when the corpse becomes free?<br>
me: or notrth tov raid?<br>
me: how are groups in mult group raids supposed to loot stuff?<br>
me: like epics, dragons, planes, etc?<br>
me: this is a standard posted verant policy man<br>
Kaikachi: That is somethign that you have to keep in mind when you do this. obviously if the looting person is in a different party than the group that got the kill, they are going to need to wait for the corpse to open, but i'm afraid when it does..<br>
Kaikachi: open, anyone and everyone has a chance to loot it.<br>
Kaikachi: open, anyone and evryone has a chance to loot it.<br>
me: can you escalate this please?<br>
Kaikachi: simply because it's a multy party raid does not mak it a protected corpse or a protected ite.<br>
Kaikachi: item.<br>
me: so if magister is in tov i can spam click the corpse and try and get loot?<br>
me: please escalate this.<br>
Kaikachi: i am the final point of escalation for issues dealing with the server, and for issues dealing with policy.<br>
Kaikachi: any corpse, no matter what, when allowed to sit long enough for it to become &quot;open&quot; is lootable by anyone.<br>
me: ok, i reported your response and screenshotted it. it goes agaisnt posted verant policy on their web page.<br>
me: ok, thanks, it is apparent we don't ahve to do guild raids. just follow other guilds around and ninja loot.<br>
me: you might want to check the verant policies on this though, you are wrong.<br>
<br>
I talked to Moonlite directly and she said something to him. Don't have records of this.<br>

[Sat Oct 13 05:16:07 2001] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:20:34 2001] Kaikachi tells you, 'Do you have any /reports done showing who was the rightful recipient of the item? Further, do you have any reports done showing Medicuus' intent to ninjaloot the item?'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:21:21 2001] You told Kaikachi, 'we killed it, our guild, and randomed it. and were standing around it'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:21:53 2001] Kaikachi tells you, 'But do you have any /reports or can you make any /reports showing either who was to get it, or that Medicuus was going to ninja it?'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:22:50 2001] You told Kaikachi, 'we could report the random and the kill shot. we don't get loot messages from medicus'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:24:02 2001] You told Kaikachi, 'you can check guildsay logs that showed sirbones saying send tells for the necklace too'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:24:04 2001] Kaikachi tells you, 'Not the loot message from Medicuus, anything from her where she says she was going to loot the item, or after she did, any boasts that she had ninja'd it.'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:24:16 2001] You told Kaikachi, 'are you kidding me?'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:24:48 2001] You told Kaikachi, 'so your policy is that a char can follow guilds to north tov and spam right click as long as they dont say anything?'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:25:35 2001] Kaikachi tells you, 'No, that was one of the things I asked for. You may have missed my other point in that, you need to make clear and specify who it is in your raid that is going to be getting the item. If you don't specify outloud that X person is getting it..'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:25:41 2001] You told Kaikachi, 'of course she isn't going to say anything and that isn't a requirement. you bust people for hacking and training without requiring proof that they said they were doign such things'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:26:05 2001] Kaikachi tells you, '...then it is not a reserved item or items.'<br>
[Sat Oct 13 05:26:56 2001] You told Kaikachi, 'this was a guild only raid, a stranger wandered up. i am going to post this entire conversation to verant and the boards. you are violating stated verant policy. i don't know why and dont really care anymore.'<br>

I just read the whole thread, ouchy. I dont know why meddicuus hasent respond to this thread. But I will tell you her side of the story or her story to the best of my knoledge.<br>
<br>
 ---------------- ----  Here it goes.  -----------------------<br>
<br>
----Golems tells Meddicuus: What was that thread from a MS member all about.<br>
<br>
----Meddicuus tells Golems:This is what happen; I was running to res a few of our RoD members and I saw a bunch of dragon corpses, and I saw a corpse rot. I looked in one of them and looted it before it rotted like the other one.<br>
<br>
-----Golems tells Meddicuus: Hmm, where there any MS people around the corpse when you looted it?<br>
<br>
-----Meddicuus tells Golems: No<br>
<br>
-----Golems tells Meddicuus: Any corpses?<br>
<br>
-----Meddicuus tells Golems: Not that I could see. <br>
<br>
-----Golems tells Meddicuus: I see, dont know why MS would flame you than. But, if no MS member or MS corpse where around that could indicate that they still wanted the corpse or that they got wiped out and could not loot the corpse I dont see why they would be upset over you looting a corpse that they did not need.<br>
<br>
-----Meddicuus tells Golems: Its true.<br>
<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
-----------I would like to ask a few questions --------------<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
   *MS, could you post any screenshots of Meddicuus looting the corpse while you still being in the the zone/dragon corpse at our webpage?<br>
<br>
   * MS, why did you not speak to our leader directly if you wanted him to know what had happen? I mean, why did you not try to speak to us before you guys flamed on this board using our Guild Tag as one of the main topic?<br>
<br>
<br>
If you wanted to save RoD reputation you would have not come to this board and would have instead talked directly to our leader. So when you say if RoD woud not like to have there name smeared by this person they should guildremove her/him. I think you guys should have given Berit an opportunity if you thought that meddicuus had taken your item knowing that you guys where still in the process of looting it or even near the corpse that would indicate that you still had interest on it. I dont know why anyone would post here to save a guilds Reputation and mock on its foundation.<br>
<br>
    I just think if you would have wanted results rather than flaming our Guild you would have done it accordenly and respectfully and in return actions would have been more in your favor. So if you indeed like to see RoD act, present proofs to us. Our Webpage has the email addres of our officers and leader for your complaints. <br>
<br>
    I will always believe a guild member over anyone else if there is no proof tht defies our member storie. <br>

<br>
If it really was a mistake, which I doubt it was since I was there with two MS groups close to the corpse, why then didn't she try to apologize and try to make up for it somehow?I know that if I'd make a mistake like that, I'd atleast post something on the guild's message board apologizing, etc. And I don't really buy that she wanted to loot it before it "rotted". Level 55+ corpses lasts 30mins right? Is she saying she waited around 29 mins before she looted it?<br>

Toad and Pop weren't the only ones to get GM items during the skyfire event. Grammaw from Children of Darkness got a Hero's Coin from that event too and recieved a damn nice belt for her roleplay. Couple others got coins as well. Why not you?<br>
<br>
So shut your pie hole, just because some people are in 'first tier' guilds, it doesn't mean that they can't come up with creative and inventive ways to make this game better than it is - including lame GM events.<br>

<br>
Disclaimer: This is my PERSONAL side of the matter.<br>
<br>
I was there, whined myself into MS action and got invited. I'm not a member.<br>
<br>
We were killing dragons in opposide side of ToV entrance. We had something like 12-20 people in zone. Clearly something that you can spot with one /who.<br>
<br>
These dragons have habit of running away when dying, so the corpses were not always at the base camp. However they weren't like miles away from the camp, you could clearly see the camp from each of the corpses. The Western Wastes zone at that spot is a valley with steep walls without any real visibility obstacles. And I highly doubt that the corpse was left there all alone, even though base camp was few meters away from it.<br>
<br>
We were pulling fast enough and the dragons weren't really a challenge for our force, so we didn't end up cheering and taking screen shots after each kill. However we by no means ignored the loot. We were there for the loot (7/6 necklaces). In fact our master looter cleric was so concerned about loot, that our favorite bait chanter once died to DoT after the fight, while cleric was running to loot the corpse.<br>
<br>
<br>
Adding up the way I see it:<br>
<br>
Might be she didn't see anything by the corpse, but that means she didn't bother to look. Standard WW dragon corpse is large enough to hide people who stand the opposide sight of it. Also our camp was in visibility range from the corpse, if for some reason there at the moment wasn't anyone with the corpse.<br>
<br>
With any experience whatsoever about the game, level 60 player knows that neck piece with 7ac and 6 to all stats and saves is a good gear and it doesn't drop from a green_con_mob_12 that aggroed some passer by player. By simple checking /who was visible RoD people coming or going somewhere and about 15 MS people.<br>
<br>
She did not use any standard channels (ooc/shout) to check if the corpse was left to rot or not. She didn't wait for long either, because MS was on the process of randoming the necklace right after the kill. After looting it she didn't show any remarks of being sorry or wanting to repay the error she had made. <br>
<br>
I make my conclusions based on these facts.<br>

I think you may be thinking of a previous GM event. Actually I'm positive. I was there when Grammaw received her token. I also received a token. If I'm wrong however then good for her. I like Grammaw.<br>
<br>
Until this thread I wasn't aware MS members had received tokens or prizes from the GM event that I'm referring to.<br>
<br>
This brings me to an important point.<br>

Good point Chuk. I'm pretty sure it wasn't snowing (because I hate it and I recall that it was very clear there then), but I can verify it from my log.<br>

<br>
The visibility was anyway clear enough for me to constantly check, that Sontalak was peacefully in its place, thus it probably wasn't snowing and if it was, the visibility from the corpses to our camp would still be clearly enough.<br>

I know this because I have grouped with them and have seen this first hand.  My observations plus the other people who agree that Medicuus is a loot whore just shows you what really happened.<br>
<br>
Medicuus sees a dragon corpse.<br>
They take a look at what is on the corpse.<br>
They see a item thats better then what they have.<br>
They see MS is a little ways off.<br>
They think/hope they wont be seen if they loot the item and gate.<br>
They failed.<br>
<br>
Golems do you really expect us to have a screenshot?  Do you really think we stand around a dragon that can be killed with one group posing for pictures?  We pull these poosae dragons as fast as we can to get loot, we dont cheer, OOC, or call mom and dad to let them know we killed a usless dragon. Its called PHARMING.  <br>
<br>
Medicuus has admited to looting the neck, so why doesnt she gather a group of people and kill some dragons in WW till you can replace the item or give us 40k(if the neck was dropable it would prolly sell for alot more) in peridots?  cuz she is a loot whore and could give two shits, she feels dodging the situation will make it go away.  Why is RoD avoiding it also? <p><center><img src=http://eosone.i8.com/kani_sig.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usagemonprayeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sagemon Prayeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/15/01 7:29:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mendiccus of R.O.D.</span><hr size=1> Golems, you shouldn't have made that post.  You're just making yourself and your guild look even more foolish and desperate.  Foolish, because Medicuus's explanation for her theft of the neck piece is ludicrous, and anyone with half a brain (which excludes Curmy) knows that she's lying.  Desperate, because the only reason a guild would allow an outright thief like Medicuus to remain a member is because it cannot bear to lose a cleric.<br>
<br>
If Medicuus had been running across Oasis and saw an unlooted crocodile, that would be a different matter.  People sometimes blow off looting mobs that don't drop valuable loot.<br>
<br>
This was a dragon corpse in Western Wastes.  I'm sure that there have been mob corpses in WW that rotted, but not very many.  Golems, if you were running across WW, and you saw a dragon corpse, would the thought even cross your mind that it might be okay to run over and loot it?  Of course not.<br>
<br>
Golems, there is nothing dishonorable about defending a guildmate, but it is most certainly dishonorable to associate with a thief.  If RoD chooses to do nothing, it will be making a powerful statement about its character and integrity, or more importantly its lack thereof. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/15/01 8:11:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mendiccus of R.O.D.</span><hr size=1> Dunno.

<br>
A reason there is probably no reply from the accused is because, there is no real defense for what was done add the that a history of like behavior and the truth is pretty evident. I personally would not hold RoD responsib;e for this but, I would also add that if they allow this person to remain guilded I would not trust RoD with a lollipop either. May be some great peeps in RoD, but I don;t know one form the other and thus will treat them by thier lowest common denominator. <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sarastro>Sarastro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/15/01 8:41:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mendiccus of R.O.D.</span><hr size=1> It seems pretty clear thet Mediccus did, if not a completely dishonest and deliberate Ninja looting, then at least a totally reckless speed looting, ie, she really tried hard to NOT see any evidence that the corpse was claimed by some rightful owner. From what I have heard here and what I know of MS she did Ninja it quite on purpose, of course she is playing innocent now, who wouldn't.<br>
<br>
The best way to treat a troll is to ignore it. I didn't notice any troll in this post. I don't even know why I wrote this.<br>
<br>
Tullaian, just want to explain how Medi could get out of ToV and then gate. She must have been non KoS to CoV. Then you can stroll right though west wing unmolested. No need to gate out.<br>
