A lot of heretics burned at the stake afterwards were converts from Judaism. A recent tv doc. over here made the Inquisition sound a bit like a holocaust, so there ya' go...<br>
<br>
As of the current crisis in Israel/Palestine today by the WB of the Jordan River, this is bad all around. Israeli mobilisation may have escalated the entire Arabic region. Palestinians are at real risk of being butchered because of the suicide bomb attacks. Then consider the holiest ground in Christendom is an Arab safe refuge. Israel risks the desecration of Christ's birthplace, in Christian eyes, if any Muslim blood is ever shed there: though Palestinian terrorists have not given up their weapons, fleeing into the Church of the Nativity of Jesus Christ seeking safety may be regarded by Christians as an act of faith in God, and in your fellow man, Jesus Christ, baby. <br>
<br>
If religious arabs entrusted their lives into the hands of the resident christian order inside that place, seeking shelter from a certain death, they shall have the entire Christian world onside weeping at their people's straits.

I have a hard time believing that.  In fact, Palestine was not an independent entity at the time of those purchases.  If Joes Schmou owned Wyoming it is not necassarily his right to sell that land without some type of approval.  In the case of Palestine, you can't say the purchases of land by zionists was legal.  There was no legality there is Palestine didn't exist as an Independent entity.  Furthermore, most of the land was given to them by order of the U.N. and not purchased.  Yes, a large amount of land was purchased but not a large portion of present-day Israel.  <br>
<br>
As far as your analogy of the Spanish Inquisition goes, thats true but not fair given the evolution of the Humanity-ideology.  That Shlt happened a Long time ago.  <br>
<br>
  I'm not taking the Palestinian side.  As far as I am concerned they are both trash.  BUT, the major point I am trying to make is the lack of news coverage in favor of the Palestinians.  Everything we see is Pro-Israeli.  I could give a Rats-D!ck about Israel.  I believe the majority of Americans are being fed Zionist propaganda.  Zionist no longer means, homeland for Jews.  Now it means, home for Jews at the expense of another people.  DOESN'T that sound like 'Lebenstraum' to you?   Lebenstraum means, living space in German.  Thats the propoganda the Germans used in WW1 and WW2 for their desire for expansion.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I think everything is fvcked up now.  You can see that bad things have happened to Jews and Palestinians.  Fvck them both.  <br>

<br>
First off, let's cut out the "my friend" Bull<b></b>@#%$, Martigan. I don't know you and you don't know me. Besides, there are better ways to invoke a condescending tone in a posting. :)<br>
<br>
<i>"Prior to Israel becoming a nation, they were the persecuted ones in the area."</i><br>
<br>
Really? Where is your evidence? The British (who protected Palestine up to 1948) seemed all to happy to allow Jewish migration into the area. If persecution there was so bad, then please explain the mass exodus of Jews from Europe and Asia to Palestine?<br>
<br>
Hmmm... Israel didn't pruchase the Sinai, Golan Heights, and the West Bank. If they did then please point me to your resource. Also, what do you call it when people who never lived in Palestine <b>immigrate</b> to Palestine without a dime to their names in most cases to live in a Kibbutz? Have an idea, Martigan?<br>
<br>
<i>"Palestine was and is still just a puppet group of people being exploited by the Arab countries as a means to harm a country they hate, and that's Israel. During the years after the 1948 revolution, Palestine existed as a puppet of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria!"</i><br>
<br>
Let's see, the innacuracy in your statement is mind boggling. You really have no clue as to the history of Palestine. That is obvious. So, let's see if we can have you nail down a couple things, shall we? 1) Which years "after the 1948 revolution" do you refer to? 2) Which Palestine existed after 1948? (I am still dumbfounded you think there was one).<br>
<br>
Truthfully, there is no need to move on "my friend". Martigan, I have read a good deal of your posts. Please stick to the trivial and less rational posts you have proven good at writing.  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

This is another part of what is going on.  If the Jewish peoples were not pursecuted, then they have Zero right for the existence of the country they chose to leave.   But I have a feeling they were probably pursecuted or discriminated against from having any kind of power in their own country post-Arab take over.  Not sure about this.

<br>
<i><b>Diaspora</b></i> is the Greek word for <i>scatter</i>. It was first used in reference to the "dispersed Jews" living in Athens, if I recall correctly.<br>
<br>
What is important is that anyone of the Jewish faith not living in the Holy Land is considered a "Diaspora Jew".<br>
<br>
Outside of the Holocaust of WWII and the Spanish Inquisitions there have been no siginificant persecutions of Jews. When Rome converted to Christianity in the 4th century CE (AD), Jews had already been disliked but were not rounded up and slaughtered. It was the Jewish rebellions of the 1st century CE (AD) that caused Roman hatred for them. This was not religious persecution or solely ethnic, too. You will recall that other peoples lived in that region who equally hated the Romans.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until Rome fell to Christianity that propoganda against Jews (the Christ killers) was churning out. The Church Fathers hated Jews as the fallen Children of God, since Jews could never seem to do God's will, according to the Fathers. I recall that the Council of Nicea (approx. 360 AD?) condemns the Jews, restricts all Christians from marrying Jews, and forbids Christians to socially interact with Jews. However, there was no call for physical violence against those who were Jews.<br>
<br>
I think it is important to emphasize there is a difference between being "Jewish" from being a "Semite". The descendants of Akkadians, Phoenicians, Hebrews, and Arabs are all Semites (usually entailing they are people who speak Hebrew, Aramaic, or Arabic). The point here is that one can be a Semite and not be Jewish and vice-versa.<br>
<br>
So, the claim that European and Asiatic Jews (those in the Diaspora) have on Palestine is strictly an ideological one. What legitimacy can be given to the claim of a 4th generation German-Jew saying Palestine is theirs? Or, they are a citizen of Israel? S<b></b>hit, I could convert to Judaism and make such a ridiculous claim, too!<br>
<br>
At any rate, the so-called "Jewish Persecutions" in history have been few and far between. However, there is an underlying hatred amongst Christians towards Jews through out history which led to general persecutions such as those during the Spanish Inquistions. It must be remembered that Christianity not only persecuted Jews, but Muslims, Hindis, any other da<b></b>mn fuc<b></b>king religion or non-religion that disagreed with their fundamental tenants (including atheists). Some of the most evil in the world has been done at the hands of Christian Fundamentalists.<br>

Muslims in the region have, for the most part, lived in peace with Jews. Muslims have, through out the centuries have given options to those who they conquer. You can be killed, convert to Islam, or publicly submit to Muslims to earn a writ of protection. The writ or protection was basically a segregation law forbidding the "protected one" to eat, drink, sleep, and otherwise interact with Muslims except to work. So, other peoples could live in their ghettos at peace with Muslims for the most part. Jews were not alone in this, Christians and others would also be granted such protection for their submission.<br>

  I had a feeling from scattered information over time that the Diaspora was a choice the Jews made and not as a result of persecution.  Hmm, that can't be helpful in the case for the zionist.  <br>

   I have learned so much on this board.  Its great to discuss such an array of issues with so many people.  There is going to be an Pro-Israeli rally monday at our school and was thinking of attending for a bit to see what kind of things they are saying.  I think I have learned enough to hold a pretty good argument.  I will make sure to quote you.
