There is no way to tell what he actually believes. I suspect it would not matter.<br>
<br>
As for Boesky, I assume you didnt meet him in jail. Thus your prove my point.<br>
He suffered relatively little compared to the damage he did. That is why I speak<br>
of equity. <br>
<br>
I suspect industrial feudalism may be better than straight capitalism but I have no way of knowing that.<br>
<br>
I defend no system because no system is perfect. The people must be allowed to<br>
profit from their labor, or they wont labor. That is the lesson of the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>
There was a time in this country when men who 'hurt' alot of people ended up getting run out of town on a rail, if they simply didnt have an accident or vanish.<br>
I dont believe in anarchy but I do believe in equity. You destroy my car, I want it replaced. You steal 150k, I want it back. You kill my wife, I want you dead.<br>

I cant offer a solution because all solutions are assailable. <br>

There is the decision that sets us apart Carathos. I may not agree with the Supreme Court on several issues however I do respect their rulings.<br>
I may complain, obfuscate, drag heels etc but in the end, I respect the decision.<br>
<br>
To 'me' respecting the ruling has the same reverence as the flag you support.<br>
In fact moreso since the flag is inanimate. I dont have the arrogance to assume I <br>
know better that NINE of the finest jurists that the Prez could find to nominate.<br>
To assume that I could outthink Nine other minds would be collossal folly.<br>
<br>
Since we cant appeal to your veneration of the court to persuade, I will try this:<br>
<br>
Carathos, the state is more powerfull than you are. You are unwise to cross it.<br>
It is not suddenly ok to burn a flag, bra, effigy. It has never BEEN against the<br>
law to do so. By asserting YOUR morals are superior to another citizen, you advocate anarchy. Be carefull. The United States is MORE than a piece of colored cloth.<br>

  I do think serious improvements are needed in the stock analyst limitations (perhaps restoring the true separation there once was from the money side), and in accounting practices allowed by the SEC and IRS.

And my prior comment turning your own words against you, was more of a generalized comment regarding your conduct throughout the board, not just this thread.<br>
<br>
You tried to rationalize that it wasn't WRONG to burn a flag, merely because the Supremes said a ban was unconstitutional.  Those two items are not mutually exclusive.  Something can be permissible, and still be wrong.<br>
<br>
See, that's where you constantly misunderstand others.  Carathos is stating an opinion regarding right and wrong, not constitutionality.  [I happen to agree with the Supremes that our Freedom of Speech must permit flag-burning, but the act is still wrong.  If someone tried to do it in front of me, much like the &quot;punk&quot; that set a Bible on fire in front of me in college, I'll put it out.  That's my Freedom of Speech in action.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ]  Your effort to bring in some other criteria (like constitutionality) is one new way for you to cloud the real issues.  It's a common theme in your posts.<br>

<br>
The word you used 'wrong' it is wrong to burn a flag. Even if I felt it was a gross<br>
insult, I would feel it was a GROSS INSULT, not WRONG.<br>
<br>
You introduce morality into a situation berift of morality. It isnt morally wrong to destroy your own property. God will NOT send you to hell for it.<br>
<br>
You confuse the issue of gross insult to observers with right and wrong. That doesnt equate. The flag itself is meaningless. You are really saying that people<br>
are 'WRONG' (yourword) to insult the United States. Can we assume that if I burn an effigy of Saddam Insane or Bin Laden, that isnt wrong, but of George W. it IS wrong?<br>
Why is that? They are both human. Last time I checked god didnt care about<br>
politics.<br>
<br>
So the issue is really about offending YOUR sensibilities. Well Raedwulf, I think you know how I stand on that issue. Your sensibilities do NOT take precedent over mine. That 'IS' an enforceable issue. The Nazis did march thru Skokie.<br>
I just think that in some situations it is foolish to challenge the state. <br>
<br>
If you crawl up the flagpole and remove that Confed flag from the SC capital,<br>
you will find an armed emmisary of the state waiting for you when you come down.<br>
You can talk it over with him.<br>

To use your words, I disagree that a Gross Insult isn't wrong.  I'm not saying it is wrong to insult the US.  Please don't interpret what I say, as you have a hard enough time understanding my actual words.<br>
<br>
You are right, the Nazis did march in Skokie.  The law permitted them to do it, even though it was wrong from them to do so.  And it may be illegal for me to take public property from the SC capital bldg (it's a wood shed with a crescent moon on the door, right?), but that doesn't make it right that they put it there.  Right and wrong is more than just a summation of the laws of the land.<br>

<br>
I suspect you are right and that to you it would not matter. I suspect that your problem with Mr Novak is largely because of his conservative bent. Similarly I seem to find Begala, Rangle, Sharpton and most of all Carville, among the most obnoxious men I have ever heard in large part for what they say as well as how they say it.<br>
<br>
I also suspect that while you are worried about the excesses of capitalism, we will never hear you speak about the excesses of the welfare state that Mssrs. Roosevelt, Pepper et al wove into the fabric of our country.<br>
<br>
I believe that the excesses you discuss are not inherent in the systems, they are inherent in human beings. The true reason, in my opinion, why you cant offer a better solution has more to do with human nature than any excesses inherent in any of the prospective systems.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;There was a time in this country when men who 'hurt' alot of people ended up getting run out of town on a rail, if they simply didnt have an accident or vanish.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Please enlighten me. Immediately after the formation of our nation, many people were assailed for speculating in the Continental Congress and the States' debt instruments or Army pay chits. They were called greedy for speculating to the detriment of the public. I am sure you know about the carpet baggers after our civil war. You probably also know about Ida Tarbell's serialized accusations against John D Rockefeller. Just when was this golden era during which these bad men were punished any differently than they are today?<br>

In addition what we laughingly call 'liability' for actions has been limited by the same mechanisms. Torts beyond the company assets are not recoverable.<br>
By carefully concealing company assets (or not as with WORLDCOM) there<br>
is sometime no way to measure worth at all.<br>
<br>
Right now the ONLY mechanism that intimidates business is tort, that is why they are trying so hard to remove it. Microsoft has proven beyond any doubt that if you are big enough, you can get away with anything EVEN if you are caught red-handed. The public did notice that.<br>

that you would find it VERY difficult to remain in KC. People were different then.<br>
Another example would be a man being held w/o actually being charged, by order<br>
of the state governor, this man was in custody in the county jail. A mob arrived<br>

Rebublicans have lied to ME PERSONALLY. I will not forgive them for it.<br>
Nixon lied about Watergate, Regan bout a whole whale of stuff but we can mention<br>
Oliver North, George H lied when he said he knew nothing about it.<br>
This man was the ex-head of the CIA. And I am supposed to believe he knew nothing. What I believe is he is either lying or inept(take your choice)<br>
In either case, I dont like him. I dont want to hear about Bill C getting his knob<br>

Big money buys them politicians, and we let them do it. THAT is what a sheep does. He grazes and hopes that the wolf doesnt eat HIM.<br>

I dont think FDR was a great PREZ either. He tried to pack the supreme court<br>
and used force against the citizens.  And he DIDNT fire McAurthur for being inept.<br>
<br>
Politicians in general simply all suck. Period.<br>

<br>
Young children are VERY impressionable. Things you are exposed to every school day could be important to you. Don't say that he or she wouldn't know who this &quot;God&quot; is. When I was 6 years old my parents were being scared by the simple fact that I had any kind of religious standpoint. Children may be a bit difficult to communicate with at times, but that doesn't mean they can't think.<br>
<br>
Me personally? I'm not religious really at all. I'm skeptic of just about anything I'm told that I can't find proof of. Personal opinion, of course. I also have a slightly twisted sense of morals and ethics, but I was raised in a Catholic household by Irish Catholic parents. It isn't their fault. It's my own doing. Surroundings only do so much. After you are exposed to something, even at a young age, it is up to the individual to decide what they think. If it were any other way we'd all be zombies. BUT, and the big, ogre sized BUT, just because someone (like myself) has less of a full set of morals, doesn't mean we're monsters. You meet me in RL, you find that I'm your average guy when it comes to manner and appearence. I don't go around stealing things or killing people just because I don't find such measures totally unacceptable, I don't because society just wouldn't want me around. Hard to play EQ from prison eh? <br>
<br>
So you know a bit about me. I've proved myself hypocritical at this point, saying that young kids pick up from their environment, but that I didn't at all. I can't be the only example right? Let's have a little scenario. You find a bag of money on the street. It has a name on it. Your parents, through raising you, have taught you as such that you would return it without question. However, it is entirely up to you. They would never know after all. Flipside: your deadbeat parents would have told you to keep it. You could decide that no, someone else might need it more. We have freedom of CHOICE. I've seen the t-shirts with that &quot;Freedom OF, not Freedom FROM&quot; bullcrap before. It's both. We are free FROM any religion *being forced upon us*, but we have freedom OF *choice of any religion*. By forcing upon I don't mean simple exposure like the Pledge, I mean religious persecution.<br>
<br>
Now, I stand firmly on the side that it should be removed. Why? Simple. We have freedom of choice of religion. We choose not to. With that phrase in there it implies that we are pledging our allegiance to a nation UNDER GOD, something atheists/agnostics simply won't do. Thus, we cannot be loyal to our country without believing in God. The whole issue with money is a slightly different one. It is all capitalized and thus more flexible, so anyone bringing that up needs to start looking at their money. But, atheists argue that simply implying GOD is against their beliefs. Well, I don't see this issue brought up so much. Why?<br>
<br>
I heard an opinion somewhere, in a book, but I cannot give credit directly to the author (please tell me if you know). It went like this: Some day, far in the future, archaeologists will uncover the remains of a country called America, that worshipped some sort of god called &quot;The Dollar&quot;. Read please, and feel disgusted. Thank you. Next!<br>
<br>
Gloriana has come up with some very nice arguments and all, but it's the same rhetoric we hear every day from non-religious advocates. It works, yes, but unfortuantely the religious fools have thought up clever enough lies to shoot down such points. Our weapons are outdated; we need some new ammunition.<br>
<br>
Now I'm tempted to finish with some sort of valid argument to wrap up my ramblings, but I can read your minds. The Christians anyway. By implying I have loose morals, you think I'm scum. Great. You think I wouldn't care, but you may have noticed that I take the opinions of others very seriously. Hard to be who I am if nobody believes it. So my comment is thus: if you are so intolerant as to despise someone with different beliefs but the same loyalties to your country, you are no less than a monster. Yes, I am quite loyal to the US. In a couple other countries I'd be burned as a heretic for slandering religion. Or shot. Or diced up and tossed in acid, heard they do that somewhere. So by simply not hating me, I love my country. But, should the government turn religious and such arrangements are no more, you can bet I'll be one of the first to set up shop in Siberia. I'm already wondering if they offer DSL there.<br>

Oh, and in case you were wondering what I think about the issue itself.  I think the guy that brought the suit should be made to pay all court cost if the decision is struck down on appeal.  Its frivilous to the extreme and a huge waste of time and resources.  <br>
