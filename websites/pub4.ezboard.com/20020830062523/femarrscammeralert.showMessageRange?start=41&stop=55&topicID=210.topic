Ysall posted an account of the scammer and situation, nowhere did he ask for sympathy.  If you're so fucking stupid you cant take a factual post at face value and must degrade the person making it i feel sorry for you because yours must indeed be a sad lonely little world.<br>

I have known Vellous (Sp) aka Gukmol for about a year IG. He always seems to start helping someone the same way and in the end they always end up getting scammed. I know of another friend who had teh same thing happen to him when Vell was trusted with the account info. Raylor was his name. Vell geared him in full cleric quest armor and some other very nice pieces way beack when and then once Raylor had amassed some better gear and plat Vell did his deed and claimed a friend had stolen the information from him and had also stripped him as well. At the time I gave him benefit of the doubt but now this is the second time that I know of and I think we can put 1 and 1 together and see a pattern here. Anyway just a lil background that I know of. <p>Gummjai

I did take the post at factual value, I call em as I see em, and anyone that shares their account info is a fucking idiot. Ysall posted up here, so her post is open to public opinion, and I don't care what you say Ysall WAS looking for sympathy, opinions are like arseholes everyone has one it's just that some are shittier than others. <br>

Did you get bored Mitch is that why you had to start with the name calling again, I reckon your attempts at flames on me must give you a hard on, do you type with one hand and stroke it while you try to compose every moronic post?<br>

This person clearly was simply trying to inform as descriptively as possible....calling him/her a tool and a moron isnt productive. Recall at some point in this game we all had a heart and a certain innocence. Flaming people for that just makes me sick.

I'm sorry Ysall, you deserved WAY better than all this... the scamming and the verbal abuse here!<br>
<br>
Ysall is a sweetheart, anyone that has EVER met her knows she'd go WAY out of her way to help if she could. And then she gets bitten for it...<br>
<br>
It amazes me that there are people like Velleius around ( not just in game, ANYWHERE ) that have SO little in thier lives that they can spend months of time building a friendship and trust, for the SINGLE point of destroying it. But yet, there they are just the same. *sigh*<br>
<br>
And as for Dwarkan, what is UP with you? That's another class of people... the ones that have so little in thier lives that they do nothing but hang around web boards looking for people they can take anonymous pot-shots at. And you pick the Scammer board... find people when they are down and whack em again for even TRYING to help. Nice work there... maybe you should check & see if there IS something you can do about that pinecone. *sigh again*<br>
<br>
At any rate, thanks for the heads up Ysall. Hope I see you in game again soon... and if I can help with anything, please holler! And grats on getting your stuff back... must have found a GM in a particualrly good mood. ;)<br>

Why do you bother to even try to work out why I visit this forum? Sounds pretty strange that you try and work out why people come here, have you got nothing better to do than try and work me out? I wouldn't bother if I were you (which thankfully I am not) you won't figure me out so save your three last remaining brain cells for your next job interview at McDonalds.<br>
<br>
I don't come to this forum so I know who scammers are, I trust no one so I don't need the warnings, I come here to be an arse, start shit and laugh at retards who are foolish enough to get scammed by some twelve year old scamming fuckwad that has been smart enough to gain their trust and do a number on them. If you don't like my attitude or me thats fine I am not out to win a popularity contest.<br>
<br>
Do I think scammers are cool? Hell fuck no, should people warn others about them? Of course they should. Am I going to continue to call people idiots when they get scammed through their own foolishness and then look for sympathy? Probably.<br>
<br>
Like me or hate me I am here and I am staying, learn to deal.<br>

I never said I try and work out why people come here, I just was wondering why YOU did, but that obviously was a waste of time which I had to waste.  /boggle<br>

Your intelligence amazes me.  I gues you have a single clue about me and what job I would be interviewing for next.  Good to know you finally bought a clue at Wal-Mart.<br>

You realize this was all you had to say, thanks for the info, I was just curious why you came here, but seriously thanks for flaming me once again with no provocation whatsoever.  It just makes me understand you even better.<br>

I don't need to call anyone a fucking idiot to feel better, I do feel a bit of sympathy for you, I know it must of been hard having to put up with your father searching for the holy chocolate river by jamming his member up your anal cavity every night but you really have to move on or get a restraining order put out on him.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;letting&quot; me do anything, well I don't need your permission to do a damn thing.<br>

I am glad you have learned something. I have learned something as well and that is that I now Know that a fuckwad with three brain cells is capable of learning something, actually it might only be two brain cells now since you probably wasted one of them learning your new found wisdom.<br>

I have always asked myself whether I am intelligent enough to make a gues, I have tried to make a gues, I read a book on how to use my limited mental capacities to make a gues, but I could only gues that you are a fucking retard, I think my gues was spot on.<br>
<br>
I have always tried to gues whether one day my I would be able to spell &quot;GUESS&quot;<br>

I don't need to feel better about myself my life is going great as it is. The only reason I have to flame you is that you are a fucking retard who likes to smoke his fathers blue veined cigar for releasing sexual tension.<br>
<br>

Everyone feels like they don't deserve to be called an idiot, ask all of your friends, oooops sorry bad idea you don't have any. Even a dead set 110% genuine Idiot would say they don't deserve to be called an idiot, however it still doesn't stop the fact that they are indeed an idiot. Not sure what point you were trying to make with that statement, maybe you should try taking one thumb out of your crusty arse before philosophizing.<br>

0000h Ph3333r one of those l33t &quot;grow up&quot; comments. I feel sorry that you ran out of ammunition as soon as you touched the first letter on your keyboard and begun to compose this pile of shit that you call a post. you have dealt with people that make me look like an angel? GREAT FANTASTIC BRAVO, however I don't know what the fuck your statement has got to do with anything regarding this thread, was it induced by a childhood flashback of one of your dads adventures up your anal cavity?<br>
<br>
Continue to flame you if it makes me feel better? It don’t make me feel better, don't need to as I said before my life is going great, looks like you take things on here a whole lot more seriously than I do, I am sorry that you have such thin skin.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me know that you will be fine, I was so worried about your physical and mental state, no really I was.<br>
