<br>
About these lists:<br>
First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<br>
<br>
Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<br>
<br>
All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<br>
<br>
I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input so far.<br>
<br>

Paladins:<br>
<br>
<br>
ITEM: Defensive Skills.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Paladins would like an increase in their defensive skills, those like Dodge, Parry and Riposte. Obviously a paladin should be a good warrior, and the design was that they would be better at defense than offense. But in making any adjustment to these skills, the paladin should not become a better tank than a warrior.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Divine Strength Stacking.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not stack with the 50th level ranger buff Call of Earth. As these seem to be two of the defining spells for those classes at those levels, they would like them to stack.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Stunning.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Paladins, like shadow knights, would like to be able to stun more things at higher levels. Perhaps allowing stuns to work on some of the more powerful monsters would not be unbalancing. This might be an interesting idea in conjunction with some other ideas on this list, and might be useful in making the sword and shield combination the signature of the knight classes.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Bash.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Not only raise the skill cap on this, but perhaps even base a discipline on it. Perhaps one that would allow all bashes to stun (and against any creature) for the duration. Perhaps even allowing critical hits with the shield. Again, this might help define the knight hybrids as users of the sword and shield.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Lay on Hands.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: There are several requests to make this power better. Giving it the effect of Complete Heal, allowing it to heal a value equal to the paladin’s base (unbuffed) hit points, reducing the reuse time gradually for levels over 50 and even a discipline that would turn it into a group Lay on Hands. Also, it would be nice if there was no way that a paladin could use up his Lay on Hands on an invalid target.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Yaulp IV.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: There have been requests to add this spell to their lineup at level 59.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Increased Taunt.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: With their somewhat limited ability to deal damage, paladins might have trouble taunting. They would like an increase in their ability to taunt.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Shields.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Perhaps creating better shields for knights. Ones with better armor class. Perhaps even finding a way to make shields that can proc on a successful bash.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Wave of Healing.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: The recast time on this spell is 1 minute. That seems pretty long for a 200 hit point group healing spell.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Celestial Cleansing.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: This spell might not really be an upgrade to Superior Healing. And the 30 second recast time makes it less appealing.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Flame of Light.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not have a particle effect.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Holy Forge.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Most paladins are unhappy with this discipline. They would rather see it replaced with a more defensive (or THE Defensive) discipline. It seems like it might be a fair idea to allow them to have critical hits on undead at all times (though perhaps at a lower rate) once they pass the level where they get Holy Forge now. If a replacement discipline is chosen, a shield block or bash-based discipline might be the direction to go.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Divine Glory (53).<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Some paladins feel that this spell is underpowered, especially when compared to the 51st level ranger spell Strength of Nature. Divine Glory is a 100 hit point buff. Strength of Nature buffs 75 hit points and 25 attack.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Divine Favor (55).<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Some think that the long recast time on this spell is out of proportion to its usefulness.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Piercing Skill.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Since two-handed piercing is based on the piercing skill, perhaps we should raise the skill cap for the knight classes in this skill.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Lull spell line.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: People think this line of spells is too easily resisted and/or causes too much aggro. They claim to use it more for pulling than for anything else.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Store bought lances.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTOIN: We should probably add these so that the knight classes can practice their piercing skill at the lower levels.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: White Armor and Shield.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if paladins in game could look like the one featured on our art, with the white shield and the white surcoat.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: New Discipline Idea.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline that would help make the paladin more useful on raids. It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead. So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Deepwater Armor.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: They would like us to re-evaluate the effects on this set of armor.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Trueheart Shield and Theologian Claymore.<br>
<br>
These items are found on the plane of Hate, yet have a basic graphic. It would be nice to make them look fancier.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Two-handed weapon minimum damage.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: How about making the minimum damage on two-handed weapons a little higher, perhaps based on the base damage of the weapon, to help bring up their popularity. After all, they should hit hard.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Superior Healing fizzle.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: This spell fizzles a lot.<br>

They will increase our bash cap, base a skill around shield blocks, and even give us a disipline for use with a shield HOWEVER they don't adress the fact that we don't have much of a selection when it comes to one handed weapons. <br>
<br>
In Kunark Paladins have 3 class specific weapons. (Sword of the Morning, Halycion Broadsword, Rod of Faith) The only &quot;easy&quot; one of these to get is the Sword of the Morning. And even it is a mild upgrade to the DMHWS from hate. There is still one or two rods on Lanys, and no HBs... Mainly because HB is No Drop and has a 1% chance to drop of those Ancients in Skyfire *boggles*<br>
<br>
Rangers and Shadow Knights have 9 a piece...<br>
I won't mention all the ones that warriors and monks have.<br>
<br>
Some will mention the fact that there are plenty of weapons that are shared through a variety of classes, however many of the one handed weapons that are shared are MEANT to be duel weilded. If not taunt and dmg out put is in-effective.<br>
<br>
They claimed there would be more weaponry available in Velious... well hey guess what!<br>
<br>
Sword of Blessing is 19/29, same as the Mace of Shadowed Souls.. you know that common as all SIN mace that every twink SK and there dog has. Wanna know where this is?<br>
<br>
The Sword of Blessing is a No Drop paladin only weapon that can be found in the lower Kobal pit in Velketors Lab. Now the level of the MoBs down there ranges from 50 - 60. They hit on average from 100s - 215s. Thats not including names. Encountered a named Kobald down there last night that quads for 300s FAST as hell. The only way my party was able to kill this sucker was with a lot of runes and good timing on heals. And this named drops total crap too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Go figure <br>
<br>
Now 3 days down there and the Kobald that can drop the sword (Jelek Icepaw) has spawned 3 times and each time droped a caster book. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Risk =!Reward<br>
<br>
Next we have Natures Defender! Well this quest was in for about 1 day than taken out. I count myself lucky for being able to complete it. Well this quest was so out of wack in comparison to Firey Defender,  I have my doubts on if or when it will return to the game. The Sword it self is incredible, however it is Tunare Paldin only, so a Majority of Paladins are SoL.<br>
<br>
Next, is a weapon which name totally escape me at themoment. But I recall it having slightly less stats than Firey Avenger, 2 handed, with a nice undead proc to it. Its a bit on the heavy side but he this is the type of weapon we should see more of... Wanna know where this is? Skyshrine... off Lord Yelinak! <br>
<br>
The biggest complaint from paladins has always been and will continue to be our lack of weaponry! There is not enough weaponry for a paladin to use. If they want shield disiplines, skills, or raised caps... give us the weapons (hey and even the SHIELDS) to use it with...<br>

Shows how poor our epic sword is I think =(.<br>
<br>
But more than this, I feel paladins are continually shafted on usefulness in raids. I ALWAYS feel like I'm either just fodder or invited because I am in guild. Granted most tanks are fodder ( and I don't mind and expect to die on all raids), but at least warriors can achieve a &quot;needed&quot; disc, SK's can hope to land a HT, rangers and monks have discs...etc. etc.<br>

<br>
Maybe more Rods will come into the servor now b/c of the key increase in kaesora, but they still need to make it easier to get to and from Charasis.  The run there is a bitch when compared to just going to seb or karnor's.  And don't get me started about the run back from an evac there.  /sigh<br>
<br>
Paladin weapons will always blow, we are a def. tank that is sub par at what we do, compared to war's.  They won't add better easily obtainable weapons b/c then maybe we would rival the mele tnk's dmg in game, and that would be unbalancing i guess.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
It pretty much does suck though that they make our equivalent to the moss(sk) or a lam(war) no drop by killing any chance of a HB being obtained by a paladin, or a SoB for that matter either.  And what the hell would a paladin be doin in skyfire anyways, not like we can solo anything in there, druids and necro's are what you'll mainly see in there, and why would they wanna group w/ a pal, cept for maybe a decoy i suppose.<br>

If you see a pal 50+ using a 1h weapon other than SOTM, for the love of god please tell me, cuz I would love to know so I could get it  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
