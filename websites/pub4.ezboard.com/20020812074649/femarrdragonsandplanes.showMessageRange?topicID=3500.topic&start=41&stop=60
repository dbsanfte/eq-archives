That's right everyone blame me for the fact that Chiteng is a liar, that makes mountains of sense. Chiteng it wasn't only me you were trying to prove a point to so you are proved a liar yet again, the title of this post had more names than just mine in it.<br>

I agree with Igota.  And Chiteng is, what, 30...ish...?  How ever old he said he was, and how childesh he acts, trying to keep pushing, fighting like a 2nd grade baby, his dead parents' souls must be disappointed they raised such a poor kid... you can fill in the rest.<br>
<br>
But no matter how much people dislike him, and how much he keeps pushing to alter what is reality, why does he keep trying?<br>

<br>
Second, since no one apparently cares what you think (aside from the hallucinogenic, silent masses), why do you bother and why should we care.<br>
<br>
Third, the mere fact that someone agrees with another, does not mean they are jumping on any bandwagon, a fan, a sheep, or some other ad hominem with the purpose of attributing a lack of thought.  In fact, it would appear that your anti-bandwagon (disagreeing with me for the sheer sake of doing it) is the only thing involving a lack of reason or intellectual honesty here.<br>
<br>
Fourth, there was no &quot;premise&quot; in anyone's post regarding you being wrong.  It is a simple fact based upon the evidence before your eyes.  You are wrong when you claim no one gave you any consideration.  They read your comments, and determined you to be full of it.  They demonstrated how.  That is not in keeping with your argument.<br>
<br>
Fifth, if you truly post only for yourself (and this claim is just as transparent and false as many of your others), then go do it in your word processor and stop cluttering up the board with crap.  If you aren't seeking an audience, posting in some forum where no one will read your lunacy will satisfy your need to respond.<br>

No one forced your participation. Also I dont recall calling YOU a liar. Can you show me where I said that? You might on some fundemental level have a shred of<br>
honesty. You have to. Your 'proffession' demands it. You also know what<br>
reasonable doubt is. I would not call you a liar unless I knew you were lying.<br>
<br>
Second my purpose IS being served. You just dont recognize it.<br>
<br>
Third 'I' am the arbiter of 'IF' I get consideration. No one else. Certainly not you.<br>
<br>
Fourth Igota's post have been uniformly hostile, there has never been a shred of doubt where he stood. He is posturing.<br>

Yes my posts have been like 99% or more in disagreement with you, and a great many of them have been hostile, most of the jabs were done for humors sake, I found them funny and my friends did as well, I never really stopped to consider what their tone and implicit malice may have felt like for you and for that I apologize, sorry if I hurt you, but I really think you are far too defensive to even listen to what I have to say, let alone be affected by it. <br>

What is the basis of your conclusion that no one gave your position any consideration?  All I've seen is people quote you over and over and over again, and discuss the actual words you used.  That demonstrates that people have made an effort to determine whether you were being honest or not.  Your &quot;doubt&quot; modifier was properly ignored by everyone.  You doubted you had as many as five, but denied you had 30.

<br>
Not at all. I understand perfectly. I can accept your statement as valid. <br>
<br>
I think it might help a bit if I explain something(s) to you:<br>
<br>
First and foremost, there are and were cheaters and exploiters on Erollis Marr.<br>
Not all have left. Some have assumed positions 'ingame' of power. It matters not at all to me how responsible they are NOW. What matters to me is accountability.<br>
I want the truth known.  That is how all this started. But nothing is static.<br>
The obvious cheaters are known to their freinds. They all know it. As I have been<br>
so often told. 'we dont care' <br>
Well hey thats great, but 'I' do care. I am NOT going to stop caring.<br>
Now if people want me off their backs, all they have to do is admit their wrongs,<br>
and say they are sorry. Its really quite simple. However they have been denying<br>
it so long, that its habit really. They also 'resent' this person who seeks to expose<br>
them. No one likes to be called a cheater. It kind of detracts from the egomania.<br>
<br>
Second, some players are abusive. This should be obvious to anyone who has<br>
encountered them. I dont like them. I want them to go away. I want them<br>
identified. These types are quite prolific at the top. I am certain that everyone<br>
on the mud has run into at least one such person.<br>
<br>
Now, to take any stance, that implys that the above two points are not valid,<br>
marks you automaticly as sheep. The old timers all know its true. I have talked to them at length about it. They just are NOT willing to come down on the malefactors. They have 'too much to lose' They have invested alot of time<br>
getting to the positions they are in, they dont want to risk it. I can understand that. I just cant find it admirable. So the bad guys win. At least that fight.<br>
<br>
Now as Silverain has posted, I make alot of posts. I am almost always panned.<br>
Surely you can see that this make a guy defensive. Most people would quit,<br>
but to me the Crusade is a goal unto itself. They never have complete victory<br>
if even one man is fighting them. I am here, and I am fighting.<br>
<br>
I dont normally posture. What I say is normally what I believe. I also dont share<br>
the sophmoric humor that passes for 'jest' on this board. I do have a sence of humor. I am certain people have seen it expressed.<br>
<br>
I defend Mitch because she has done nothing wrong. The same people that condemn HER let others pass who have done the same thing. That tells me that the real issue isnt the actions, its Mitch. Mitch is a good person, and one hell of<br>
a raid leader. She deserves better. <br>
<br>
Justice must be impartial, or it isnt justice.<br>
<br>
Now, having said this, I assure you, I am sane, I do have a goal, and a purpose.<br>
It doesnt matter to me if it is shared or abbhored. I follow my cause with relentless devotion. If I am attacked, I will defend. If I see injustice, I will say so.<br>
<br>
On this board I am a Paladin in the truest sence. I dont really care if anyone agrees. Truth is not a hostage of agreement.<br>
<br>
Dwarkarn - I bear ill will because of his treatment of Mitch<br>
Raedwulf - He is Intellectually Dishonest like Williams Jenning Bryan(sp?)<br>
He will subborn the truth, in attempting to gain victory. I find that contemptible.<br>
Carathos - This guy just keeps attacking. It doesnt matter to him WHO he attacks.<br>
Just read his threads. They say it all.<br>
Kerryn - I have no idea what motivates this guy. All I know is that he will<br>
come out of left field and attack. Leaves me no choice but to defend.<br>
Chukzombi - has a pathological hatred of Mitch. So much so that I suspect<br>
(without proof) that he found Mitch desirable ingame and when he decided<br>
she was actually male(no proof of that either) it triggered his pathology.<br>
The perfect love/hate obsession. Only by destroying Mitch can he remove his<br>
longing.(all that is guessing BTW - but I would put money on it)<br>
He dislikes(?) me because I like Mitch. <br>
<br>
Ice - This is a prime example of the type of person I fight. He has accsess to the<br>
REAL STORY. He KNOWS what the truth is. And he denies it! Its not convienient.<br>
It gets in the way of what HE wants. So to hell with the truth. He is a willing participant in evil. He is anathema. There is nothing good about him.<br>
<br>
I dont even know ANY of these guys from 'ingame' They dont know @#%$ about me<br>
or how I play, but that doesnt bother them. What they dont know, they make up.<br>
The people who do know, remain silent. That does pain me. But I will bear it.<br>
<br>
I say all this to help you gain insight. If I fail, I still tried.<br>

<br>
I fully understand and agree with the two grounds on which you fight, but for me, you carry it too far, there are many times in life when you just suck it up and realize that nothing you do or say can have any impact whatsoever, this, for me, would be one of those times. One of the realities of our world is that people do cheat, it is not always malicious, and it does not always come at some one else’s expense, to me it just seams like some degree of it is acceptable.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, if some one is exploiting in game, I will let them know it, and then they can decide their own path, if they keep it up, it is not hurting anyone aside from themselves and therefore they can cheat to their hearts content as far as I care, but if the person is cheating and harming another person's game time, then I would step in and try and fight to fix the situation. I don't know all the details, but it seams like some of the stuff you are crusading against is just too insignificant for us to really care about it. If you only fought the true offenders, instead of all offenders of any kind, maybe you would get more support.<br>
<br>

One way or the other, thanks for taking the time to explain your point of view, I think a lot of us have a bit more hope for your sanity now :) <br>

I want the truth known. That is how all this started. But nothing is static.<br>
The obvious cheaters are known to their freinds. They all know it. As I have been<br>
so often told. 'we dont care'&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Gee  after 3 years they are no longer filled with bile and hatred and lust for vengeance? You might learn from them. As I said before, you are a sad little man who has nothing in his life but hate. Who the hell would hold a grudge for three years and let that hatred dominate their life to the point where they need to post ad infinitum over an extended period feeding the fire of hate and need for vengeance inside them over a stupid game? You cant possibly have fun playing the game with all the hate and bile inside you related to it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Well hey thats great, but 'I' do care. I am NOT going to stop caring.<br>
Now if people want me off their backs, all they have to do is admit their wrongs,<br>
and say they are sorry. Its really quite simple. However they have been denying<br>
it so long, that its habit really. They also 'resent' this person who seeks to expose<br>
them. No one likes to be called a cheater. It kind of detracts from the egomania.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
more likely they fear this weirdo who has stalked them for years over some perceived slight their pixels did to your pixels. I hope these people, no matter what they did, NEVER give in to your bullying. Whatever they have done to the game or its society cant possibly be worse than your constant attacks on this board, the individuals it is comprised of or the society it is. Amazing how you care so much about these supposed wrongdoers but dont care about anyone else in this society except yourself and Mitch. I bet Mitch feels dirty all over knowing this affinity you have for him. <br>
.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Second, some players are abusive. This should be obvious to anyone who has<br>
encountered them. I dont like them. I want them to go away. I want them<br>
identified. These types are quite prolific at the top. I am certain that everyone<br>
on the mud has run into at least one such person.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Everyone on this thread has encountered the type. YOU! You are abusive. You get your sick perverted pleasure only by denying others pleasure and causing them pain and discomfort. You intentionally post here to antagonize as many as possible. The more you annoy them, the more you get pleasure from it. Your high and mighty claims of holy retribution upon the wrongdoers of yore, are transparently nonsensical. You admit to no purer motive than winning debate points. Your posts are constantly full of attacks. You never even pretend to offer anything positive, because there is nothing positive in you, just a dark evil malevolence. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Now, to take any stance, that implys that the above two points are not valid,<br>
marks you automaticly as sheep.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
typical   This is not an absolute truth despite your stating it as such. Typical tactic of yours.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The old timers all know its true. I have talked to them at length about it. They just are NOT willing to come down on the malefactors. They have 'too much to lose' They have invested alot of time<br>
getting to the positions they are in, they dont want to risk it. I can understand that. I just cant find it admirable. So the bad guys win. At least that fight.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
amazing how conveniently none of what you say can be proved. You claim TV and radio commentators as your sources which are not easy to confirm. You claim secret mysterious informers who wont come forward. You state as fact things which are laughable even when described as opinion. You never can just prove what you say. Of course I find their refusal to align themselves with you much more admirable than your intent to merely cause as much discord and pain as you can. And despite your lies, THAT is your only purpose here. You gain pleasure from the seeds of discord you sow. The more discord you sow, the more pleasure you derive from your time here. The only time the &quot;bad guys win&quot; is when people respond to you on your terms. They ensure you get the sick pleasure you seek.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Now as Silverain has posted, I make alot of posts. I am almost always panned.<br>
Surely you can see that this make a guy defensive. Most people would quit,<br>
but to me the Crusade is a goal unto itself. They never have complete victory<br>
if even one man is fighting them. I am here, and I am fighting.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
stop wrapping your depravity in such holy trappings. You are here fighting because you get off on it. No other reason. The Crusades you pattern your own crusade on were nothing holy and merely about the aggrandizement of the Church at the expense of the Moslem society in the Middle East; your efforts here are similarly about your own self aggrandizement at the expense of this society. Anything you say denying this is a lie and one that all here see through. You say it for only two reasons. One, because some tiny shred of you believes it, and second because it adds to the sick pleasure you get from being here causing others discomfort. Using debate tactics to win brownie points is NOT fighting some holy battle against the forces of evil. It is feeding your sad pathetic little life with what passes for pleasure in your eyes. It is perpetuating a 3 year long obsession with whoever did ill to your pixels in some game. It is providing a purpose to your sad little life that wouldnt exist if you didnt manufacture it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I defend Mitch because she has done nothing wrong. The same people that condemn HER let others pass who have done the same thing. That tells me that the real issue isnt the actions, its Mitch. Mitch is a good person, and one hell of<br>
a raid leader. She deserves better.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
so Mitch is a Saint. He has never done anything wrong. Maybe I know this to not be true. Maybe I have seen Mitch engage in behavior I found to be less than admirable. So what? Do I engage in a 3 year vendetta? Maybe others wouldnt have objected to the behavior I observed.  Not having a god complex like you do, I do not assign myself the position of Gabriel at the gates of heaven. I would ask you just who the F you think you are but you have made that clear in the posts you have written which I have read. You state your opinion as gospel. You brook no disagreement. You offer nothing positive. You never admit even the possibility that you might be wrong. You state clearly you are not a member of this society because you dont care about anyone but yourself. You only attack others. You offer no consideration of anyone's opinions but your own. When backed into a corner you take your ball and go home or change the rules to suit yourself. No one as anti social as you would be carrying on this crusade for reasons other than your own self aggrandizement.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  Justice must be impartial, or it isnt justice.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
first, this is another of your opinions which you state as fact. Second, it has NOTHING to do with your motivations here.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Now, having said this, I assure you, I am sane, I do have a goal, and a purpose.<br>
It doesnt matter to me if it is shared or abbhored. I follow my cause with relentless devotion. If I am attacked, I will defend. If I see injustice, I will say so.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
For the first part, I dont believe you are sane. For the rest of the first sentence here, I am sure that no one doubts this. Your goal is your own pleasure at the expense of as many others as possible. Your disregard for the feelings and opinions of others brand you an antisocial outcast. You feed off this. I am sure you have built whatever in game slights you have imagined by these hated evildoers in your mind to mortal sins. You use these imagined slights as holy trappings to rationalize in your own mind this assault on this community for your own perverse pleasure. I am sure you feel their assaults on your pixels as surely as if someone took a lance or sword to your own real life flesh. How else could any rational sane person justify to themselves carrying on a 3 year vendetta against a handful of pixels on a computer game?<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;On this board I am a Paladin in the truest sence. I dont really care if anyone agrees. Truth is not a hostage of agreement.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
LOL   Is this the rationale of a sane person?  If it began with the phrase &quot;In my own mind&quot; instead of &quot;On this board&quot; I would believe you fully. As written, it is just further proof of your lack of a firm grip on reality. In truth the analogy would be closer if you compared yourself to Don Quixote. Totally dismissive of those around you who see reality more clearly than yourself. Lost in a world that only exists in your own head. Needing desperately to cloak your actions in some holy and chivalrous trappings. Playing your own game by your own rules, without regard for society or anyone around you, changing those rules arbitrarily when it suits you. And like Cervante's hero, you need to pervert the real world around you to manufacture enemies. <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Dwarkarn - I bear ill will because of his treatment of Mitch&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
somehoe I have never pictured Mitch as some Dulcinea who needs protecting. He seems to do ok on his own without a protector.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Raedwulf - He is Intellectually Dishonest like Williams Jenning Bryan(sp?)<br>
He will subborn the truth, in attempting to gain victory. I find that contemptible.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
wow!!  is this the pot calling the kettle black or what? You have admitted to engaging in debate tactics in these threads. You dont believe in anything. You change the rules when you choose to suit you. You are constantly redefining terms a la Clinton to weasel out of intellectual corners. It seems to me that it is almost unanimously that this is how people see YOU. That being the case any sane person would step back and reconsider themselves if he finds contemptible the very behavior he is found guilty of by so many.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Carathos - This guy just keeps attacking. It doesnt matter to him WHO he attacks.<br>
Just read his threads. They say it all.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
again, Pot meet Kettle<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Kerryn - I have no idea what motivates this guy. All I know is that he will<br>
come out of left field and attack. Leaves me no choice but to defend.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
truly sad. You have many choices. You could stop your own attacks. You could let go of a three year crusade against people who supposedly did harm to your pixels. You could lose the god complex. You could stop being so antisocial that you dont care who you hurt or how many peoples toes you step on. You could ignore him. There are many courses of action for a normal sane person. Of course for a latter day Don Quixote, there is only one course of action. Tilt with windmills. Live in his own self generated world. Wrap himself in trappings of a paladin that only exist in his own head. Stubbornly dismiss those around him who see the real world more clearly than he does.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Chukzombi - has a pathological hatred of Mitch. So much so that I suspect<br>
(without proof) that he found Mitch desirable ingame and when he decided<br>
she was actually male(no proof of that either) it triggered his pathology.<br>
The perfect love/hate obsession. Only by destroying Mitch can he remove his<br>
longing.(all that is guessing BTW - but I would put money on it)<br>
He dislikes(?) me because I like Mitch. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
So what?  What if all of this is true. What makes it any of your business. Only your need for trappings of a sick perversion of logic to back up your own insane actions and vendettas and attacks. Again, Mitch does not need your protection. He can take care of himself. This is just another excuse for you to strike out blindly and irrationally. Another brick in the structure you have built in your own mind to support the sick little antisocial world you live in and try to impose on us.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;That does pain me. But I will bear it.<br>
<br>
try bearing it in silence . . . please<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I say all this to help you gain insight. If I fail, I still tried.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Liar. You have already said you dont care about any of us. So why would you care about providing any insight to one of us?You said all of this for your own sake. You have this great need to wrap your antisocial attacks and hatred in something good and holy. This type of post is to you what the backstory behind the world of Norrath is. It fills in the fantasy world. You just have a tough time determining what is fantasy and what is real life apparently.<br>
