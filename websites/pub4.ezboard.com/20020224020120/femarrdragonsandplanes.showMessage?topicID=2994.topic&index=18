The &quot;happy&quot; people are the ones that learn to deal with these things and take them as they come.  The &quot;I-hate-my-life&quot; people are the ones that let all of this stuff get to them.<br>
<br>
I used to get stressed out about EVERYTHING in life.  And yes, I was made fun of a lot when I was younger, mostly because I had way messed up teeth (I can sympathize there), but luckily got braces right before high school started and had them off my senior year.  Now, during high school and Jr. High, it was mostly the &quot;teacher's pet&quot; type comments that I got.  I was a fairly smart person and usually one of the top kids in my classes.  No, I wasn't a kiss ass, just smart.  So I've dealt with my share of insults (not to mention having older siblings!!)<br>
<br>
I used to let all of this stuff get to me, and I'm not sure what really happened to me that I changed, but I started to realize that it didn't matter what these people thought about me.  So what if I had messed up teeth?  Was this anything that I could help??  No!  So I'd just ignore those comments.  Soon, when people realize it doesn't get to you anymore, they really do stop doing it!<br>
<br>
I dealt with the &quot;teacher's pet&quot; &quot;smarty pants&quot; stuff by reminding myself that hey, soandso may be the top football player in the school, but if he ends up blowing a knee or something, he's not gonna have anything to look forward to in life, whereas I have a million avenues open to me.  You just have to try to look past all of these things to see what's really going to matter to you 10 years down the road.  <br>
<br>
I've only been out of high school about 2 years now, but I'd say the only things in high school that really mean anything now are those things I learned everyday in the class room.  Sure, there's some importance in the social interractions and all that stuff when you get into the work force that you develop in high school, but that's not anything you wouldn't have developed on your own.  Hell, one of my best friends was homeschooled and he's just fine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But just try to focus on what things are important to you...what things will really matter in your life.  Oh, and having a girlfriend isn't one of those.  No one needs someone else to make them happy or worth something.  Granted, I've had the same boyfriend since half way through my Sophomore year, but I know I would still be happy and lead a worthwhile life if we had never gotten together.  I know I'm at least an attractive person, as I've been told, but during high school I got asked out a total of 3 times.  Some people have said, &quot;Well yeah, cuz you had a boyfriend!&quot;  Most people at my school didn't know I had a boyfriend since mine was graduated (and from a different school no less).  It kinda bothered me (especially before I had a boyfriend) that no one ever asked me out, not even to dances.  But I started to realized that it really didn't matter either way.  Sure, it would be fun to have a boyfriend and all that, but I didn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> need</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one.  I had plenty of fun with the few close friends I had.<br>
<br>
I went through a couple stages of semi-depression in my past and dealt with a lot of problems from my dad (he seemed to think curfew should be dark and B's on a report card were completely unacceptable...shit like that).  I didn't get along at all with my mom at the time (I was living with dad cuz she kicked me out since I wouldn't babysit for her while she was on vacation! (??))  But I learned to work through it and relied on those I knew were there for me and could count on.<br>
<br>
Wow, I'm getting really long-winded...sorry everyone!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Pretty much, don't let stupid petty stuff like name calling bother you, really don't stress about a girlfriend (we just cost money anyway LOL), and remember that your parents aren't always right!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And hey, if you ever need to talk about anything, feel free to e-mail me (in profile) or send me a tell in game (if you can ever find me on hehe)<br>

I met my fiance through mutual friends, so I already knew he was a cool person before we got together.  Turns out we have even more in common than I thought, and he is now my best friend as well as the man I want to marry.<br>
It sounds to me like you have one problem worse than the rest: lack of self-confidence.  I'll tell you straight up -- confidence is sexy.  Sounds like you are aware of your looks, you think you're sexy.  Good start.  Now project that to others.  Once you make some female friends, they will be impressed by your confidence.  No one wants to constantly support another's confidence (this, I believe, is why men hate it when we ask them if we are fat).  Knowing you can support your own ego to a certain degree is an attractive quality.<br>
As for not having a gf at 17, you're far from alone!  There are many many guys who haven't had a gf or a date at your age, and many women too.  I wouldn't worry about it.  It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.  Ignore the teasing and the rude assholes; they mean NOTHING to your future life.  Like Drazhkahn said -- jack and shit.<br>

<br>
  I bombed outta school.  I went to university, found that people actually like me for who I was, had a great time... and dropped out : )<br>
<br>
  I've since worked on skifields for 5 years, been on a exploding volcano, got my massuese qualifications, become a professional geek, and now work for a government department in New Zealand where they pay me exceptionally well.<br>
<br>
  What I'm trying to say is this:  people who are saying that high-school means jack are EXACTLY correct.  It's not worth getting upset about.  For sure, try and make the best of it that you can... but I can assure you, from someone who went through utter hell at school (try being a dancer in an all-boys school and we'll talk about torment : )... this too shall pass.<br>
<br>
  Confidence is a big one... have you considered perhaps taking up a hobby where you can meet people outside of school?  As I mentioned, I used to be a competive dancer, and I meet my first girlfriends through that.  It's a hell of a way to get confident with yourself as well.  Martial arts are also good for that sort of thing... get out, enjoy life, don't get locked into &quot;School is everything&quot; and above all else... HAVE FUN.<br>

Its a rant board and he's surely got good reasons to rant.<br>
<br>
Stick with your friends, be true to yourself, do the work you need to do and dont worry about the assholes at school, they tend to be the ones serving you fries and a shake as you drive through in your new BMW 5 years down the line.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly find a hobby, sport or somethign where you can get rid of the stress.<br>
