<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Salenie's Miscellaneous Thoughts on These and Other Abstract Is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></center><!--EZCODE CENTER END-->[/b]<br>
<br>
<br>
1.  Porting for donation.  You get what you get.  A donation is a gift.  I don't care if EQ has turned the meaning of the word to fee.  Fee is fee.  Donation is gift.  Everytime I see &quot;Porting for donations&quot; I am tempted to go to the druid or wizard, say, &quot;port me to XXX&quot; and then aftewards give them a rusty dagger from fishing.  That's my required donation.  No thanks. No bow.  Just their required &quot;donation&quot;.  I never have and never will do this, but I'm tempted.  Hee hee. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2.  Porting for fee.  I have absolutely NO problem with this.  If I hear the shout /porting to all druid locations for 25 plat and I need to go to Toxx I'm estatic!  I give the druid 25 plat, a bow, a gracious thank you, and a mod rod making sure they know what it is if I have the mana.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It is just time and mana.  But then, hey, so is grouping.  I would never deny someone a share of the treasure just because they are only spending time and mana.  That's all most of us spend most of the time (yes, peridots, jaspers, TL components...but 90% of our online expenditure is time and mana).  <br>
<br>
3.  I like all ice cream as long as it doesn't have coconut in it.  Just don't like the grainy texture.  Blech!!<br>
<br>
4.  This specific situation.  Seems to me there is a bit of greed on both side.  Making the poster run to a dangerous place was rude.  Having hostile mobs their was rude and inconsiderate.  Not helping them get a rez was insulting.  Running off before they finished zoning with out even a thank you or helping them regain lost xp or cost of rez because you need to get to a raid is self-centered in the extreme.  Being ticked off that you got nothing when you didn't say explicitly you required a certain amount is silly.  Being ticked off that the portee didn't lift one finger to help you after you died is prefectly reasonable.  Not being ticked off that you were killed cuz it happens in EQ is admirable. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5.  Getting a port.  I will /ooc looking for a port/TL to XXX, will donate.  If I'm really desperate, I will /shout looking for a port/TL to XXX, will donate.  I never do a /who druid/wizard because if I'm shouting and they aren't responding, I figure they are busy.  Think about it.  Druid_2 sees me /ooc.  Druid_2 sees me /ooc again.  Druid_2 sees me /shout.  Druid_2 is gonna suddenly going to go &quot;Oh, I can help Salenie!&quot; just because I /tell them?  FYI:  About 10% of the time I end up running, about 10% I get into a contract negotiation, about 20% of the time I get a &quot;I'll port you for free, come to YYY&quot;, about 60% of the time I get a port for which I end up giving 25-75 plat depending on the porters level, what I have on me, and my mood.<br>
<br>
6.  Port ettiquette.  I really feel for porters.  I think they take a LOT of crapola.  I see this a bit from the side--as a high elf in a robe I obviously can cast clarity (doesn't matter I'm carrying a shovel, in a mage only robe, have a HUGE floating rock next to me, and have been shouting XXth magi LFG).  When I tell people &quot;Wish I could cast clarity!  I'm a magician&quot; they turn around and run off more often then not.  No &quot;Thanks anyway&quot; or &quot;Sorry to bother you&quot;. Hell, I'm lucky to get an &quot;oh.&quot;  This is manners in the 21st century?  Bah!<br>
<br>
So when I get a port, regardless if it is for fee, donation, from a guildee or what have you, the person always gets:  a) a bow, b) a thanks, c) A farewell wish &quot;Safe Journies&quot; &quot;May the All Mother Guide and Protect you&quot;, &quot;May Karanas also blow the wind to your back&quot; or what have you.  If they are of an approriate level for the activity I am porting to (and I'm porting to an activity that takes others...often time I'm moving aorund to do smithing related stuff) I will invite them along. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
7.  Porting for fee.  I have no problem being ported for a fee.  If I need a port, someone charges me for it, and I agree to the contract I'm cool with it.  What ticks me off are taxi's porters that don't realize that they are working for me.  If the contract is &quot;Come to rings and I'll port you for 30 plat&quot; when I show up at rings you damn well better be ready to port me.  If they say, &quot;I'll port you for 30 plat.&quot; then I tell them &quot;Lovely!  I'm at XXX (always same zone).&quot;  This is because you are not doing me a favor....you are not helping me out.  We are in a contract.  You have put yourself out for hire, and I have hired you.  You are currently working for me.  As such I do not wait for you to do one more trade.  I do not wait for you to do a &quot;quick AFK&quot;.  I do not wait for you to do &quot;A couple of friends first.&quot;  You put your services up for sale, and I have purchased them.  I am now your highest priority.  <br>
<br>
Yes, this is a pet peave.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And it so does not apply to anyone else.  Anyone else I will come to you (and I will always ask where you are so I can), I will wait for a few minutes as you wrap something up, and I will donate plat for the ride.  That's because we are not under contract, we are not in a business relationship.  You are doing me a favor.  But as soon as you say, &quot;I will port you for (specific compensation)&quot; it stops being a favor.<br>
<br>
8.  The second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the best.  No other story line was a strong and interesting as the Angel goes bad one.  I liked the mayor a lot!  I liked the maturation of the kids in the first year of college.  I like Dawn as key (and Glory really had some shining moments).  Still on the fence about the new season.  But #2 seems like it will always be the best.<br>
<br>
9.  Druids are a great group class!  I mean c'mon?  Evacs, back up heals, snare, and at the level I'm playing at they have a FR debuff that does damage (Ro's Sundering something or other?) and as most of my DDs are fire based...woohoo!  If I could design the perfect group for KSing in a raid (not that I do that of course...but I can dream) it would be me, a cleric, a druid, and three rogues. Bwhahahahah!<br>
<br>
As an aside, I think every class rocks, IF it is played by a good player of that class.  A good ranger rocks!  A good paladin rocks (I was in a group once that could control aggro to perfection!  He could taunt mobs off the cleric with a flick of the risk, never bitched about taking hits, always stayed on the far side of the mob from my pet)!  Class bashing is silly IMHO.<br>
<br>
10.  Spectre pets are scary.  Maybe I spent too long in Oasis as a teen, but I don't care if the spectre cons indifferently, follows the necro obediently, and is named Jebeker, it still scares me.  Be glad we're not on a PvP server, I'd nuke them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
11.  Clerics charging for rezzes.  Unlike druids and wizards, I WILL /tell a cleric I see in zone that is not /role or /anon on because xp loss sucks!  (Yet another side...my formula for asking is this &quot;Hi!  Can I please get a rez at XXX?&quot;.  Seems rude to me to ask a favor before even saying hello, I will aways say please, and I hate &quot;mah&quot;. What the hell is &quot;mah&quot;?  Yes, I know it is suppose to be me.  bah!!).  If they feel that their time and mana is worth 100 plat, so be it.  I want that rez.  I can just as easily say &quot;Thanks anyway, but I guess I'll just work back that xp the long way.&quot;  I don't because I'd rather go on interesting raids or do smithing than do the xp grind.  Totally worth 50 or 75 or 100 plat to me.  Also, as I will invade their personal space, I think it is perfectly reasonable for them to dictate terms.  They didn't ask to be /tell'ed by me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
12.  Lovebite:  Loved your post!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Would love to see a druid shout:  Porting for pixels, please send tells. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   They would get business from me just for being honest.  Hee hee!<br>
<br>
13.  Clerics who give free rezes because xp loss sucks and they sympathisize rock!!  Clerics who are standing over the body and have their epic weapon and charge are appreciated, but they better never expect any sort of freebie from me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
14.  Dwarkan:  LOL!!!  That is the first post I've seen of yours that made me laugh (much to the amusement of my coworkers...see above).  Thanks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
15.  EZposts spacing.  Paragraphs are nice.  Punctuation is essential.  If you do nothing else, please at least use periods and reasonable sentance structure.  I can read a really long paragraph...I cannot read a one sentance/55 line post.  :P<br>
<br>
16.  I am bored with this now.<br>
<br>
And there you have it.  Like anyone read this far. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Thanks. Sometimes we just have to step back and look at the big picture when we get all uptight about the little things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Thus the pixel analogy.<br>
<br>
As for porting for donations..usually when I bother to do so, I really mean donations...I've ported for a bat wing before (or even nothing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). But I'm glad this thread was started as I have learned that there IS a need for a differentiation between &quot;donate&quot; and &quot;fee&quot;...I've formally gone with the vernacular use of &quot;donation&quot; as developed in the game, but will use &quot;Porting for pixels&quot; from now on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

Hear, Hear! *cheer*clap* I have ALWAYS said, whenever one of those /ooc &quot;____ class is the best&quot; conversations started up, that it's not the class or the race but the person behind the pixels that make a good character.

That is one of the nicest things I've ever read on this board.  I know a lot of porters only feel wanted for a ride.<br>
<br>
I also think the second season of Buffy was the best ever, bad Angel...leather pants... Surprise... Innocence...Passion... Betwiched, Bothered and Bewildered... Becoming 1 and 2.<br>
<br>
They are set to release the first season on DVD in January and the second season soon after.  Those are probably the only two seasons I'll buy on DVD.  There were some outstanding moments in the later seasons (The Wish, Zeppo, Hush, etc) but the second season really shines.<br>
<br>
I hated the entire season with that dopey military organization running around.  I did like the addition of Dawn, that was cool.  You think Willow will be the &quot;big bad&quot; this season? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uforishadowmoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fori Shadowmoon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 369<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 12:56:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.evernight.com/pics/ico/Makenna.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Diatribe</span><hr size=1> ack dont grp me with darmu... <p><font color=magenta>Fori Shadowmoon</font><P>

<br>
not that i charge, i've tried the /auc porting : price, half your level.. just didnt work for me. i felt.. weird. even when i had 17pp to my name because i wanted to help out a friend. i just couldnt do it.<br>
<br>
there's no telling how much plat i've passed by, i feel weird sending the person a /tell that just /shout'ed "paying ungodly amount of pp for a port to toxx". i let someone else take them, if they shout again, i'll send a tell. if they offered the amount, they want to get there. the kinder they are to me, the better chance they just saved themselves 100pp. <br>
<br>
but some people are just assholes. last night i was EC, trying to well, buy something and i get a tell from someone wanting a port to EJ. she's standing literally on top of me (i had a fletching book open or i would have saw her). i tell her i'll port her, and i'm a bit flustered, i see she's half DEAD, so i mem a heal, then i think "oh crap, EJ, cant sit there and mem a spell in the middle of the zone.." (well, we know where the 'portal' in EJ is, we know that mobs walk over it, we know that they're mean for baby druids like myself.) so i stand back up and i'm trying to heal her and she shoves money in the trade window while i'm trying to click the gem to cast, and i hit "Trade" and i thought it hit cancel, and she tells me to HURRY UP! i know this sounds like a lot, but it was probably 15 seconds or so. i was trying to be nice by healing her, i was caught off guard from her hovering. i should have gave her the money back and told her to kiss it, but. i ported her, disbanded and gating back to WC.<br>
<br>
i see your point salenie, about being hired, but when i was in the middle of doing something and you (people) dont tell me "hey, i'm in a bit of a hurry, should i get another port?" but "HURRY UP! SO AND SO IS WAITING ON ME!" is just a little.. rude. i'm not going to sit around and smell the roses, but i will get myself to where i can get my spells memed so when i zone into a flock of red highly aggressive mobs, i'll at least be able to get out quickly.<br>
<br>
i dont know, its 6am. i cant sleep. excuse me if i'm late on this topic or i didnt make any sense. :/ <br>

People who never have played porters and think that porters are there for their convenience, well, they don't know any better.  And for those porters who get stiffed by people who run off before they zone in have a right to be pissed, especially when they are lied to / responded to rudely.<br>
<br>
    I personally only had one character past lvl 9 when I started my druid, and I loved the character.  Now while I don't go around advertising my services, I keep myself non-roleplay / non-anonamous, mostly because I don't really care for those filters.  If someone sends me a tell for a port, chances are I'm not too busy to give it to them, so I'll take them wherever they need to go, provided I can.<br>
<br>
    Now if someone sends you a tell for a port and then expects you to come to them to pick them up, that's plain rude and I may refuse them on that premise depending on my mood at the time.  People who don't pay... well, I never asked them for payment so I have no problem with that.  If they do pay, all the better.<br>
<br>
    But if I do give a person a port and they are rude to me, or I refuse them based on the fact that I am irrevocably tied up with something else and they start giving me shit then they can rest assured that I will take note of them and pass the word to all my friends not to give them any help whatsoever, even if it's a heal or SoW.  It is my time here, and I would be doing you a favor by going somewhere I was not already going and then you turn around and be rude to me?   But like all things, we cannot choose the people who we have to play the game with, all we can do is choose not to help them and then pass the word along so that others are warned about the person.<br>
<br>
    On the other hand, people who demand outrageous amounts of money for a service they are capable of providing are also being rude themselves.  I have seen some of the prices some people will charge for their spells that don't have material components or high mana costs, and I just shake my head in disgust.  But then charging 100pp for a rez that costs a stinking peridot and some mana (yes, I know it's a healthy amount of mana, but then, so are ports)  I think is unjustified.  50pp?  More reasonable.<br>
<br>
   Anyways, that's just my 2cp worth.<br>

P.S.  Bards are my favorite people to port, because I have yet to port one of them without them charging me back up to full.  But they do get pissy if you stick a SoW on them.  Sometimes I do it just to annoy them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umalevant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malevant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 8:00:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick of selfish people!!!!!</span><hr size=1> I almost never get a port from a stranger these days, but when I DID, I *always* paid, or told them before porting that I had no money with which to pay them.  I figured if they were doing it for the money, they deserved to know, and almost always was able to recieve a port despite not being able to pay.  On those occasions they declined to port without payment, I chalked it up to someone's bad day and moved on; there's a LOT of porters out there, and its usually not hard to find one.  I generally steer clear of those who advertise set rates, but that's more personal taste than anything else.<br>
<br>
IMHO, it is more than just mana, its time, and if someone is spending their time playing taxi (or catapult, for wizards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), I feel its only right that I pay them.  I almost always head to whomever offers to port me, and on the occasions I don't, there's a valid reason.  I can honestly say nothing like the DL incident has occured on those occasions, but if it had, I would most certainly get a rez for the person, as well as compensate them (as I'm sure a majority of people on this server would do).<br>
<br>
I do disagree partly with the statement that you shouldn't have to pay for rezzes however.  My IG wife plays a cleric, and some of the rez requests she's gotten can be hazardous, ridiculous, or both.  If the res is in a dangerous zone, I would hope that the rez recipient would both take steps to insure the cleric's (and incidentally, their own), safety, and compensate them for running the risks associated with the rez.  If a cleric has to move to another zone for a rez, I think they should be compensated.  If its halfway across Norrath (as has happened once or twice), make sure there's a porter available, and again, compensate the cleric.  The spell does not, in fact, use Peridots (The higher end spells in the Symbol line do), but I've seen clerics get paid in them for rezzes, and I think its a smart idea.<br>
<br>
You'll find greedy clerics just like you'll find greedy porters, but most of those I've met will do a rez for free if they have the time to spare, but ALWAYS appreciate some sort of compensation.  You may be able to get that cleric to come two zones over and rez you in Iceclad once, but if you stiff them, don't provide some protection, or (most importantly) thank them, don't expect them to do so again. <p><center>Malevant Faeshadow<br>Speedbump<br> <br> Officer of the Free Company<br><IMG SRC="http://www.unicorntrad.org/three.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uk1ssk1ng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>K1SSK1nG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 722<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 8:17:54 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/images/ryurun.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick of selfish people!!!!!</span><hr size=1> /rude Fori<br>
