<br>
In regards to companies gaining the right to search through our files, which in all actuality is an invasion of privacy...<br>
<br>
Companies suspect most/all of us(and most/all of us are guilty of this suspicion) that we are in possession of pirated files(mp3's, movies, etc). Through the use of programs such as napster, and now the p2p programs, we have brought this upon ourselves. Do you honestly thing a company(or band, or record label) which puts hard work into getting it's product out to the masses would NOT be trying to take legal action if they knew that millions of copies of their product were being copied and pirated--costing them millions of dollars--against those who do the copying and pirating(us)? <br>
<br>
I'm guilty myself, i download movies and mp3's(have several gig's of them alone on my HD). I fully understand why the companies are trying to gain a right to search through our files, although i don't agree with it. Likewise, they don't agree with the p2p programs, or our downloading their products against their will. <br>
<br>
It's a viscious cycle; we refuse to stop downloading files that are pirated, and from this, the companies will try any and every way they can in order to stop us. When you get angry over something like this, it is, for the most part, the same as when a thief steals something from lets say a 7-11, and then calls it an injustice when he is arrested for his crime.<br>
<br>
Just think abou that.<br>

I read the washington post, new york times, and my crappy chicago tribune.  When you read more than one newspaper, you realize how many topics are actually omitted and avoided by others.  I've yet to find a newspaper that covers both sides of the problems, and both sides of the solutions.  Most papers are either too conservative, or too liberal, that their focus becomes an attack on the other parties opinions, and not the actual subject.  The only newspaper that comes close to an unbiased account, is the wall street journal, but then again, its focus is not primarily on politics.  If anything, Foreign papers have the best articles.  They disect everything, and leave nothing on the bone.<br>
<br>
The problem with politics (and reports on them) in general is that they are not for the people anymore.  The majority of all bills, laws, and any other decisions made in local and/or federal governments are based on party politics.  This is because less than half of the voting population actually votes.  Without an overwhelming voice of concerned voters, politicians have become decadent, and are concerned more for thier party, than they are for their people.  Although this is not an absolute truth, it is very evident across the board.<br>
<br>
So like I said, if you are fed up with the entire thing, do something.  Go out and use your vote.  It is a valuble, yet underated power.  My hats are off to anyone who does excercise his right to vote. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utovectris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tovectris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/5/02 10:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3511.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ugh</span><hr size=1> There are crack whores kicking out children for more welfare money. I pay for that.<br>
<br>
There is a thing called Social Security that the government officials I had no part in putting in place tap into when they need spare change. I pay for that and will never see a dime of it.<br>
<br>
The government organizatoins have a policy that states that if the entire budget is not utilized future budgets will be trimmed. These organizations buy $100,000 hammers and conduct research on the speed of ketchup flow to maintain their fat budget. I pay for that.<br>
<br>
The congressional system says that if a particular type of legislation is not voted on it becomes immediately active. Every so often one of these pieces of legislation hits the floor that hikes their salary and builds in an additional bonus to them. On that day they argue semantics in non-party debate and take a long lunch. The next day they have more money. I pay their salaries.<br>
<br>
Oil became too popular and too easy to import. The oil companies wrote some large checks and our influence in the internation oil consortiums restricted the production of oil. The price went up. I paid them to raise the price on oil, even after they got large &quot;donations&quot; for doing so.<br>
<br>
Lobbyists used to be in place to argue points to sway votes. They are now nothing more than brokers. Your elected officials are paid for their votes, plain and simple. I pay them to ignore my opinions.<br>
<br>
Our government shells out billions annually to countries with no human infrastructure to allow for the proper spending of the funds. Rather than sending humans with a clue to assist, we send the money and wonder why they're still starving and pissed at us. I pay for that, even while watching out national debt go up.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
I hear a lot of people screaming &quot;we live in the most powerful country in the world&quot; daily. While this is quite true, this power cannot last much longer in its current state. Septmeber 11 showed Americans that we are, in fact, vulnerable to terrorism not only from our officials (who have been commiting fiscal terrorism for decades), but from anyone with a will to succeed. In typical idiot government fashion the immediate answer to fix all of the obvious holes. You and I are paying for what amounts to pretty much nothing. Any one of us could, with proper funding, load a school bus up with home-made explosives and drive it into a nursery school without the slightest hint of Law Enforcement interferance. This can happen at any minute of any day for any reason, and the most powerful country in the world can do absolutely nothing to stop it. Our elected officials are in office merely for the money, which sways their intelligence to the side of charismatic coaxing. When the @#%$ hits the fan they can deliver a nice speech on what they'll do to take care of it, but how many of us actually believe our elected government can accomplish much of anything?<br>
<br>
It's no laughing matter. History has shown many a culture at our very point sociologically and technologically in comparison to the rest of the world, and those cultures are now extinct. The rules are different, the methods are different, but the result is the same...<br>

Let me fill you in.<br>
<br>
Sweden - socialist nation. EQ has players from there.<br>
<br>
Netherlands - socialist nation - ditto, one of the admins is from there.<br>
<br>
Norway - country of origin of Anarchy Online, socialist nation, EQ has players from there<br>
<br>
Unired Kingdom - ditto re: socialist and ditto re: players.<br>
<br>
Most of the grouping and social aspects of EQ could be ascribed as socialist: i.e the combining of individual talent and skill to work toward a common purpose as a group.<br>
<br>
In other words Anikkin, get a clue.<br>

People own theyre cars in all those countries you listed, and their homes... they just pay higher taxes because they get benefits like free medical and such... its far from a socialist country. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1397<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/13/02 2:04:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3511.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Welcome to AMERIKA !!!!

Unless the ditto-head, pinhead named Annikin (real original there, really innovative) would like to rephrase, then perhaps there'd be a discussion.<br>

Where are you from?  As far as getting ahead of someone else, why shouldn't I?  If I work my ass off and further myself, why should YOU benefit for my work?  Doesn't everyone want to be well off?  What do you mean by "catered" to them?  I'm doing pretty good in life, but I didn't have SHlT handed to me.  What I have, I earned.

BTW, the upper 5% includes much of the middle class, so you are correct.

<br>
I have to say this is fucken hillarious. My wife had to show this to me, as i am 100% swedish. <br>
<br>
If you think we are oppressed in sweden, id say you are wrong =) ive spent some time in USA and i can only say compared to us you are a police state and we are free =)<br>
<br>
We have as much or more rights than USA i think. We do not have to give up much personal information in our daily lives for example. We do not EVER do drugtests for employment for example, who the @#%$ would go pee in a cup to get a job? roflmao... lie detector tests? unheard of.. haha<br>
<br>
Every morning the american kida have to do that pledge of allegiance thing? Swedes get seriously shocked over this when they hear it, including me, sounds like something they would do in China to me not a western country. <br>
<br>
Well, as far as me not being able to play EQ ive been hanging on internet since 1994 or so and i cant think of anything im allowed to do in USA that i cannot do in Sweden, i would think its the other way around if anything.<br>
<br>
Yes, we pay higher taxes, but if we dont WANT to pay higher taxes all we have to do is have the majority of the swedes vote for another party that will lower the taxes. <br>
<br>
On the other hand i am sure no swede want to pay as low taxes as you do in USA or VERY VERY few atleast, as our taxes would be a big contribution to Sweden being ranked as the 2nd best country to live in the world, second to Switzerland holding the #1 spot... did you know USA is ranked #12 or so? =)<br>
<br>
And when it comes to democracy why do you only have 2 parties to vote for really? Sweden have a lot more and the number is changing depending on how many parties feel like running for government. <br>
<br>
We have parties that want no more immigrants to come into sweden and kick some of em out, we have parties made up of mainly immigrants too. We have an Environmentalist party which make up a part of the government today, we have a party thats a little more like your republicans... and yeah we have a communist party and we have a socialist party... and we have a Center party, another is called liberal, we have a christian party .. etc.. we have atleast 10 of em making our government today, with a Socialist majority as they got like 30-40% of the total votes.<br>
<br>
I think my point is, before you bitch and say we suck, do your damn research. My wife is american, what makes you an expert on Sweden? hehehe... im afraid the attitude of the person i quoted is seen as typically american in most parts in the world. People who speak up and sound so convinced without having any clue at all, just assuming USA is best and all other countries suck?<br>
<br>
If you feel like it.. look up the crimerate in sweden and compare it to USA for example and remember we do not even have as strict punishments as you do, except when it comes to drunk driving i think. We have no death sentence and &quot;life in prison&quot; usually mean 10-14 years no more. Its a few people considered very dangerous that wont be let out .. perhaps 20 total or so. Good or bad? *shrug* Nothing is as simple as some try to put it, &quot;We rule, you suck!&quot;, doesnt really work. <br>
<br>
Im not saying Sweden is @#%$ great, im just saying USA isnt for sure, if you think that maybe you should spend some time in other countries for a while. <br>
<br>
Ive been in all the european countries, some asian, some african and USA. Have you Anikkin? =)<br>
<br>
BTW Cordail, I love how you define how our government works without having a @#%$ clue! Did you know people in USA eat children and its socially accepted? Im not kidding its true!! <p>Maxander Minigris - 58 Blackguard<BR>

I assume thats to me, although I don't know here it came from.  I'm guessing you read my name and someone elses post and mixed them up, because I was in no way putting down socialsit countries or defining how they work.

<br>
Any idea what the real definition of poverty is?  You're struggling from day to day to feed yourself or your family, you've no opportunity for work, and you're beyond recovery (in a nutshell).<br>
<br>
What does the average American below our &quot;poverty line&quot; have?  3 TV's, 2 cars, and more kids than they should.<br>
<br>
Where does that welfare check go half the time?  How much of this stuff do we as people really *need*?  <br>
<br>
People don't realize how selfish they've become.  How much personal attention they demand.  I work in retail, I see it everyday.  It's not always a big, world-defining issue.  It's usually something as basic as &quot;The Customer is Always right&quot;  Which EVERYBODY knows is one giant pile of bullsh!t.<br>
<br>
It's gone from 'if you treat me like ass, I'll go somewhere else' to 'Worship the damned ground I walk on, or I'll sue the *#&amp;% out of you, and THEN go somewhere else.'<br>
<br>
A lot of us are of the generation of 'self-esteem.'  A system where everyone around you told you how goddamned special you were.  Everyone got a (meaningless) prize because nobody could be left out, everybody had to know that they were the best, even if everyone else was the best, too.  So why change?  Why try to do better?  You're already the best, what's the point?  Fail first grade?  No Problem, go ahead and move on to 2nd grade when your mommy and daddy complain, because we wouldn't want you to feel like you're not as good as the rest of the kids.  Why?  Because you're so f__ing special.<br>
<br>
Maybe that'll clear things up a bit.<br>

As in, you can either leave or make the best out of a bad situation.  In my job, we have 8 network analysts, one for each school feeder pattern (feeder pattern = usually 1 high school, 1-2 middles and about 6 elementaries).  Well, after being the analyst for our main administrative offices for some time, I took over a feeder pattern from a guy that quit.  And let me tell you, it's a nightmare.  He didn't do one blasted thing.  (I'm getting to the relevancy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  Every time I go to one of my new schools, I find tons more work that needs to be done, because it had been neglected for so long.  It was no secret that he didn't like the job, but come on, the least he could have done was quit sooner or taken pride in his work, even if he didn't like it.  I have absolutely zero respect for the guy now.  For someone to come in for 8 hours and not do a thing because he doesn't like where he is, is ridiculous.  So yes, you CAN either leave OR you can make the best of things, but, for God's sake, don't just sit back and whine.  There's a good chance you're hurting others by doing so. <p>Wildane Crazywolf<BR>53 Shaman<BR><BR>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rambunctiousrogue>RambunctiousRogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/15/02 10:44:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3511.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Welcome to AMERIKA !!!!
