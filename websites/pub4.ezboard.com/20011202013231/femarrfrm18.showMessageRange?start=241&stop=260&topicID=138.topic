Do I believe in God?  Absolutely not.<br>
<br>
Do I believe in any supernatural form? Absolutely not.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will give a few reasons... but this is not the proper forum for such a discussion.  If you want my full reasoning, i'll be happy to discuss it, Email me at uyriter@uomail.com<br>
<br>
Anyway, to address a lot of people:<br>
<br>
1) If you believe in god because,  &quot;If i'm right, I'll be eternally saved, if i'm wrong, that's ok, cuz I won't be damned.&quot;   Well, that has to be the most immature view ever, I won't even get into it.<br>
<br>
2) If you were raised from a young age to a religion, that you still believe in, I immediately question your reasoning.  It's no secret that people can be conditioned to do or believe in things, just as animals can be trained.<br>
<br>
If you were raised that way, you probably never put much thought into it.  Err, if you have put a lot of thought into it, it's probably biased thought. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
A few points I would like to make.<br>
<br>
If a god does exist, than it almost certainly is NOT the Christian god, or any god that any human has ever come up with.<br>
<br>
We are only mortals, remember?  We are not capable of understanding such things, at any level for any reason, even the existance of.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, If we cannot understand anything, including the existance of, then the agnostic view would be plausible.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
I can't prove there is no god, but I can tell you why I feel one does not exist.<br>
<br>
I believe &quot;space&quot; is infinite.  I won't get into why, that's another discussion.  Therefore, I conclude that god must exist in this, a physical universe, rather than some ethereal plane.<br>
<br>
Now if this God exists in a physical plane, then he is suspect to certain restrictions, such as traveling faster than the speed of light, and the atomic THEORY (which I believe in:  not out of faith or convenience, but rather from evidence.)<br>
<br>
If god is subject to these things, than he is immediately physical, and MORTAL.  Since god is not mortal, (right?) than he can't exist in a physical plane, and since there is no other form of existance, than he does not exist.<br>
<br>
Again, I wish to state again that this is OBVIOUSLY NOT FACT, just what I believe.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing, if there is a god, does he believe in god too? (not itself, I mean, but rather another god? that created it?)  How can it (GOD) be sure that it is the supreme being, as apposed to some other god creating it, and giving it free will to do whatever.<br>
<br>
I mean, how is &quot;God&quot;, God?  How is that guy who thinks he is God in the asylum, any different than this supposed real God?  If you're truly convinced of something, isn't that all that matters TO YOU?<br>
<br>
And I know that the only thing that matter to me is my perception, which makes everything real to me.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
With all this, how can we be sure of anything? LOL, well, we can't.  I'm not, and you shouldn't believe that you are.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rambling...<br>

<br>
&quot;Well of course, but that's assuming that the only definition of a god is 'a purely good, omniscient, omnipresent entity.' &quot;<br>
<br>
I was making a general statement with regard to any concept of god that contains contradictions. There can be no instances of a concept that leads to a logical absurdity.<br>
<br>
Quote Triff:<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, even if there is a &quot;higher being&quot; of some sort (even if not omnipotent, since it is impossible)—and this was a very interesting concept to me when I first realized it—even if there is a god, nothing says that he must be good. Have you ever considered that one?&quot;<br>
<br>
Interesting point you bring up. Early monotheists (such as Zarathustra, founder of Zoroastrianism) regarded god as both perfectly good and evil. However, the problem is one of definition. How do we measure what is &quot;perfectly&quot; good and evil? We enter into a wide circular argument when we begin to define god(s) in order to help lift arguments which may demonstrate its existence. Theists are at once commited to their definitions and descriptions of god, but when pressed as to how they arrived to the definition they ultimately have to respond that god revealed its nature to them through some means such as &quot;nature&quot;. I am not convinced that there is such a thing as &quot;revelatory truth&quot;. So the short of it, Triff, is that we can bring in all the concepts of god(s) one wants, but in the end how one arrives to the concept is through question begging and &quot;revelatory truth&quot;. In either case I find nothing convincing enough to warrant belief.<br>

&quot;The point is, you can't prove there is a god just as I can't prove there is not a god.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually there are some very good arguments for the existance of God.  <br>
<br>
Here is just one of many :  One of the laws of Thermodynamics says that in a closed system things tend to go from order to disorder.  That is to say, order does not arise from chaos without external influence.  This is observable in the decay of elements (even things like copper has a half-life).  Life itself deteriorates if left in a closed system.<br>
<br>
Our very existance here tends to contradict this law of thermodynamics, without the existance of 'outside influence'.  One could easily charactarize that outside influence as God.<br>
<br>
Here is another : The existance of Homo-Sapiens has only been shown to go back about 30,000 years.  We 'suddenly' burst on the scene at that time, with no 'evolutionary' links.<br>
<br>
There is more to that story though : Carbon-14 dating.  Most people blindly accept that C-14 dating is accurate, but C-14 dating doesnt take into account a number of factors.  C-14 dating is based on the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere in the past being the same as it is now, and yet the burning of coal and oil which contain virtually no C-14 has, during the past century, lowered the proportion of C-14 in the atmosphere by an amount equivalent to 400 years. The explosion of hydrogen bombs between 1955 and 1961 increased the amount of C-14 by an amount equivalent to 1500 years.  One also has to wonder what the 18th and 19th centuries did to the base C-14 levels.<br>
<br>
Now throw in another factor : major premise of C-14 dating is that C-14 was replaced in the atmosphere at the same rate in the past as it is today.  This is highly unlikely, since the earth has looked quite different for the past few hundred years than it likely did 10,000 years or more ago. <br>
<br>
Basically scientists have assument that atmospheric conditions some 10,000 - 30,000 years ago are more or less the same as they are now.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line, carbon dating is based on an assumption whose validity cannot be known and which can be argued (and sometimes is).  Even if we assume it is correct, no one has been able to adequately explain how our species suddenly burst on the scene.  You would expect to find a LOT of fossils of creatures very near to homo sapiens, but so far they haven't.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of other problems with 'evolution' and various other things people THINK contradict creation.  But, many of those theories have big holes in them.  Me personally, I think its pretty clear our species was put here.  This is precisely why many athiests and archealogists think Aliens are responsible for our existance here.  Personally I think God put us here.<br>

<br>
There are several fallacies in this argument. Firstly, you have to bear in mind that entropy (disorder) is a purely statistical concept, and that the idea of a direction of entropy is also statistical. Therefore, it is not without exceptions[1].<br>
Secondly, you seem to be assuming that the total amount of &quot;order&quot; in the universe now is greater than it once was ... this is also not particuarly true. There are pockets of order, such as our own species, but a mathematical comparison of the order and structure in the universe at any time between the big bang[2] and now, will show you that overall, order is decreasing.<br>

This is also inaccurate. Homo Erectus is an example of a species which came before us on the evolutionary timeline, and meanwhile there are many species of apes which show greater or lesser similarity to us on all sorts of scales.<br>
Go to www.google.com and type in &quot;Human Evolution&quot; and you'll get lots of much better evidence. Here's just one link:<br>

<br>
Indeed, and these factors are taken into account by the scientific community. That's why Carbon Dating is accepted to be unreliable for anything produced too recently (last 50-100 years or so) or too long ago (more than 50,000 years or so ago). But neither of those factors affect the accuracy of carbon dating on artifacts within that bracket.<br>
<br>

<br>
The only significant difference in the atmosphere today to, for instance, the way it was 10,000 years ago is the bloody big hole in the ozone layer we've blasted out. However, we know very well how the atmosphere looked before we did that and so again, it doesn't affect the accuracy of carbon dating.<br>

Why would you expect to find a LOT of fossils? There haven't always been six billion of us on the planet, you know.<br>
We haven't found a LOT of Tyrannosaurus Rex fossils but we know they existed. Similarly, fossils HAVE been found which suggest an evolutionary pathway leading to Homo Sapiens, but since we've only recently become the dominant species on the planet, there's no reason to think that our ancestors would be found all over the place.<br>

Anyway, all that stuff sounds like religious propoganda to me. Presumably from the same people who try to get Creationism taught as an equal to Darwinism in American schools.<br>

[1] It's a little like air pressure. High school physics tells you that air in a particular space will spread itself around until it's equally dense everywhere. But in actual fact, this is merely the most likely thing to happen, statistically. It's entirely possible that all of the air in a room could suddenly crowd itself into the corners and the person inside would suffocate ... but it's pretty unlikely.<br>
<br>
[2] The moment of the Big Bang is, according to the definition of &quot;Order&quot; used by the Entropy law, the most ordered that the universe has ever been (or is ever likely to be). This is because it is furthest from the situation of ultimate disorder, in which the universe is just a big soup of equally spaced, equally energised particles floating around and doing nothing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utanacite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanacite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/14/01 3:41:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Religion aside, There is no excuse that exists that makes it right to attack citizens of another sovereign nation unprovoked.

Well Arryen, you are a classic example of someone who believes what they want to believe.  <br>
<br>
Fallacies in your arguments : <br>
<br>
&quot;Why would you expect to find a LOT of fossils? There haven't always been six billion of us on the planet, you know.<br>
We haven't found a LOT of Tyrannosaurus Rex fossils but we know they existed. Similarly, fossils HAVE been found which suggest an evolutionary pathway leading to Homo Sapiens, but since we've only recently become the dominant species on the planet, there's no reason to think that our ancestors would be found all over the place.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Your assertion that homo erectus had not populated large amounts of the world are patently wrong.  Do even some superficial research and youll find that what is being called Homo Erectus was in Austrailia, Africa, Asia, and the middle east.  Some speculation exists over evidence of Homo Erectus in North America.  I don't think they really know what homo erectus was, even their varied samples of homo erectus are not the same creature.  More like bandwagon jumping from anthropologists who actually have distinctly different species they claim to be 'homo erectus'.<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides another fact that you ignore : Homo Erectus lived from 1.9 million to 400,000 years ago.  This still does not explain how Homo Sapiens appeared on the scene suddenly some 30,000 years ago, and what came in between.  Moreover, homo erectus has been found in the same geological strata as homo sapiens, indicating that homo erectus lived with or around homo sapiens.  This is just another example of problems with C-14 dating not jiving with geological information.  Archeaology is replete with these kinds of problems.<br>
<br>
The biggest thing I advocate is that people do some research on the conclusions people make.  A lot of the things we hold to be true wind up being patently false.  One of them being Neandertal man, now recognized as a human with a debilitating disease!  When I was in school, neandertal man was the 'missing link', now a good example of scientists trying to find evidence to prove what they believe rather than having open minds.<br>
<br>
But the simple fact is that most of the skeletons of 'homo erectus' have been assembled from parts from many different levels of geological strata.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Having failed to get financial assistance from the Dutch government, Dubois enlisted in the French Foreign Legion to gain his goal. While in Sumatra, he heard about a skull found on the nearby island of Java. He was able to secure the skull and even found another like it at the same location. However, these skulls were too human looking to be of any use to someone looking for an ape-man. In 1891, he found a molar tooth along the Solo river. Later the same year, he found another molar and an ape-like skull cap. The following year he found a human femur 46 feet from where he found the skull cap. Although at first he thought it was a chimpanzee skull, after consulting with Haeckel, he declared the whole collection to belong to one and the same creature, stating it was &quot;admirably suited to the role of missing link&quot;. &quot;<br>
<br>
Facts are always much more enlightening than assertions from self-proclaimed armchair geologists / anthropologists / politicians.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is considerable evidence that Homo Erectus is not a pre homo sapiens species, that in fact its remains were found in the same strata as homo sapiens.  This again becomes a problem for C-14 dating, because geological dating and C-14 dating seem to be at odds here.  <br>
<br>
<br>
The past 'missing links' is full of failures, some of them quite ridiculous.  Some of the past failures to find missing links :<br>
<br>
Homo sapiens neanderthalensis (Neandertal man) - 150 years ago Neandertal reconstructions were stooped and very much like an 'ape-man'. It is now admitted that the supposedly stooped posture was due to disease and that Neandertal is just a variation of the human kind. <br>
<br>
Ramapithecus - once widely regarded as the ancestor of humans, it has now been realised that it is merely an extinct type of orangutan (an ape). <br>
<br>
Eoanthropus (Piltdown man) - a hoax based on a human skull cap and an orangutan's jaw. It was widely publicized as the missing link for 40 years. <br>
<br>
Hesperopithecus (Nebraska man) - based on a single tooth of a type of pig now only living in Paraguay. <br>
<br>
Pithecanthropus (Java man) - now renamed to Homo erectus. <br>
<br>
Australopithecus africanus - this was at one time promoted as the missing link. It is no longer considered to be on the line from apes to humans. It is very ape-like. <br>
<br>
Sinanthropus (Peking man) was once presented as an ape-man but has now been reclassified as Homo erectus <br>
<br>
Homo erectus - many remains of this type have been found around the world. They are smaller than the average human today, with an appropriately smaller head (and brain size). However, the brain size is within the range of people today and studies of the middle ear have shown that Homo erectus was just like us. Remains have been found in the same strata and in close proximity to ordinary Homo sapiens, suggesting that they lived together. <br>
<br>
<br>
Your other arguments are similarly flawed from a severe lack of research and using 'knowledge' based on popular media of the moment.  If you don't have the time to do the research on the pros and cons of popular ideas as well as the validity of some of them, Im certainly not going to continue to do it for you.<br>

You are making two different statements.<br>
<br>
Your first statement was simply something like the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;There is proof God existsl. Assumnig the falsity of the generaly held cosmological theories, the existence of some 'outside' influence is the best explanation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Is that right? Your latest post denies the circularity with an attempt to discredit Thermodynamics. Right?<br>
<br>
In order to successfully prove your point please provide a cogent cosmological argument for the existence of God. Otherwise saying X empirical theory fails, thus Z is the best explanation is an exercise in circular reasoning. You are drawing your conclusion in the premises of your argument and then just restating the conclusion as if you have provided &quot;proof&quot; that it is true.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well, the ideas you are presenting are not new. I think Aristotle beat you to the punch a long time ago with his cosmological arguments. At least he understood logic and could present a conclusion drawn from well formulated statements not containing his conclusion. Aristotle also did not retreat to simply discrediting the science of his day to finally conclude that a &quot;prime mover&quot; existed. He presented positive arguments for the existence of a Prime Mover, too. Something you have as yet to do.<br>
<br>
Cosmoligical arguments will fail to prove the existence of God for a number of reasons. I will point out one strong reason. When Aristotle first presented his case for a Prime Mover (Later Thomas Aquinas would strengthen the old Aristotelian arguments) he was aware that he was not presenting an argument for the existence of God. After all, the &quot;prime mover&quot; could equally qualify as some non-sentient cosmological constant. All cosmological arguments for the existence of God fail unless a cogent Ontological argument can be presented in their support. However, even ontological arguments aren't satisfying since they only offer proposed proofs for the existence of our non-sentient cosmological constant. In which case, there are not many theists who would readily cling to such arguments since the existence of a mathematical entity as the prime mover isn't at all the same as a sentient being who is all loving! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  At any rate, I am stopping here.

<br>
I think Newton invented the concept of Negative and Positive Integers so at least there we have a human way of ordering a perception of boundedness. <br>
<br>
Is there a natural scale for the constant of time? Perhaps there is one defined by science but I don't know it. In any case infinity is an abstract concept, not a physical object, the fact is that Hubbles Constant proves time is changing, what might have been a second just a second ago could well be an hour now by its old interval. You see, the Universe is expanding. It follows that what seems like an infinite space of time might in fact have been spanned by a measurable quantity by now.

Firstly, I would like to begin with the fallacies of religious deism. <br>
<br>
Lets start with the basic delineation of real and imaginary: it is often argued God must be real, that God is infinitely powerful, infinitely good, omnipotent, omnipresent, absolutely perfect, eternal. <br>
<br>
The fact is that by textual definition infinity is an imaginary quantity, the same goes for any mental perceptions of infinity or the existence of infinite beings - imaginary. Another way of putting it goes like this: infinity is not a real number, you cannot measurably quantify it, it is NOT defined. Being absolutely perfect, God cannot be more perfect than he is yet perfection is an abstractly defined quality. This is not "Real" in any physical sense either. The human notion of perfection we attribute to Godhead is a mental construct of language and therefore, being human, in contradiction this perfection is fallible, and thus not perfect. The notion of a being more perfect than anything can exist doesn't work either because that would not be perfect, it's a condition that God must exist: if he does not he is not "Real".<br>
<br>
Mind + Body dualism is another fallacy, we think a thought and it becomes "thinking", not the past tense "thought". <br>
<br>
There is much confusion caused by the failure to recognise this distinction in terms of Mind which is a notion of human awareness somehow dragged from its domain of imaginary existence across to the "Real". In the domain of "Real" the Mind instead refers to "brain" which in fact belongs to the body.<br>

<br>
You seem to have a big misconception about the big bang theory.  In its essense, it says the universe has constantly expanded and contracted, causing 'big bangs' throughout time.   In other words, the most recent 'big bang' was not the only one.<br>
<br>
That would be contradictory to entrophy.<br>

&quot;Lets start with the basic delineation of real and imaginary: it is often argued God must be real, that God is infinitely powerful, infinitely good, omnipotent, omnipresent, absolutely perfect, eternal. &quot;<br>
<br>
Actually this is what people say about God, not what God says about God.  If you check the Chrisitan Bible, God doesn't say much about 'infinity'.  It does say he is ominpresent, eternal, and is without sin.  A lot of people try to paraphrase 'without sin' to mean 'infinitely &lt;insert word here&gt;', but that's not what the Bible actually says.  <br>
<br>
On the flip side of your argument, any being capable of creating trillions of solar systems and billions of galaxys would be so far above us in knowledge and power, we would likely have about as much chance of understanding that being as a microbe has of understanding what a human being is.    One good example of this is time.  People in these threads keep assuming God is bound by time, but there is considerable indication in the Bible that he is not bound by time - that time is a creation for our convenience - and that he sees the beginning, ending and middle of our linear existance all at once.<br>

Well Warangel1 I am not speaking for &quot;everyone&quot; or concerned with what you have argued with many here in previously. I pointed out serious issues with what you had stated earlier and you are incaopable of dealing with the issues. I guess what I am saying is put up or shut up. Unless you can provide positive arguments for the existence of god, then your less than scholarly attacks on modern scientific theory is not at all convincing that your opinion is remotely correct. Also, you have provided not a SINGLE SHREAD of evidence to support creationism. You have done nothing but provide weak and ill informed opinions knocking evolution as a theory. Reading Josh McDowell and Stephen Gould will not get you very far. McDowell is a flunkie columnist who gained some noteriety amongst evangelial Christians with his series of so-called Christian Apologetics. None of his books hold much weight since they are blatantly full of misquotes and misrepresentations. While Stephen Jay Gould is a professor of Zoology he is far from the leading expert in anthropology and certainly is in no position to &quot;overturn&quot; the latest and greatest of scientific theory with his bible thumping.

He is not. Instead he supports a view of evolution called &quot;Punctuated Equilibria&quot;. I will not go into the hypothesis. I wanted to clarify that Gould is an &quot;evolutionist&quot; and is not a supporter of those Evangelical Christians who like to misquote him in defense of creationism (Indeed, he has done much work to expose the problems with their views). Neither is Gould a supporter of militant Darwinian Evolution Theory! The problem is that many Evangelical Creationist Christians like to quote (and at times plagarize!) Gould when he is at his best toppling fundamentalist Darwinian ideas! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just wanted to add the clarification.
