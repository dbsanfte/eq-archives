<br>
Yeah, I read it. It's that thread where you insist that people go to Hell for thinking about something. The scope of your insanity is fascinating. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have any idea what happened between 1947 and 1960 in Israel?  Any clue whatsoever?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Israelis kicked the living shit out of the Arabic armies. Outnumbered and outgunned, they embarrassed half the region. They were receiving no assistance from the US, and the British were actually helping the Arabs.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; 5 to 6000, that is SOME FUCKING RATIO!&quot;<br>
<br>
Good, you can count. Now count this: they don't have a chance. We can spare a city. Half a dozen cities. Half our nation. And we can still escalate this war to the point where no enemy remains alive. Try to contain your hysteria.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Am I wrong?  I want one single reason why Israel is where they are today...because of themselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
The one single reason is the complete military incompetence of the Arabs. A combined force of Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, Palestinians, you name it...got their ass handed to them by the Jews. Repeatedly. Jews with bolt-action rifles, and no air force, no help from America.<br>
<br>
How come you don't mention that, Mibby?<br>
<br>
I'm not particularly happy with Israel, but I do believe in backing a winner. There hasn't been a winner in Arabia since Saladin. <br>
<br>
So there's your single reason, nutcase. It's not because they're so great, or we're so great. It's because their opponents are a fucking joke.<br>
<br>
But by all means, carry on with your fantasy that the single most important issue in Congress is the disposition of a bunch of whiny, treacherous refugees. I'm sure they don't have anything else to discuss.<br>

Read this, you worthless, un-historical piece of dung.<br>

<font color=silver>Unfortunately for the Arab states that attacked in 1947, U.S. weapons and training that had been provided to the Israeli military allowed Israel to trounce them.

<br>
As if it weren't already obvious that this probably wasn't written by any legit source, most journalists dont use phrases like 'trounce'.  <br>
<br>
Here is a reference and a bit more info on what happened :<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/israel/iafhist.htm">www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/...afhist.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Between December 1947 and May 1948, Jewish agents in the USA, Europe and elsewhere acquired various war-surplus aircraft for delivery to the Sherut Avir. Subtefuge was required to avoid a newly imposed arms embargo and several aircraft failed to reach their intended destination. Many Jewish and non-Jewish aircrew around the world also volunteered to fly for the new air arm. In early May 1948, the first group of Jewish pilots commenced training in Czechoslovakia on the Avia S 199 fighter, following a secret arms argreement between the Czechoslovak government and the Jewish Agency. &quot;<br>
<br>
Now if I wanted to go see an Israeli version (the above is from a british aviation site), it would be much more critical of the west for its embargo, it would also mention how they bombed Egypt while smugglling some B-17s (which were never used again) to Israel, and that the Arabs air forces were whacked by a bunch of cessna pilots flying discarded british planes that they managed to peice back together after the Brits abandoned them..   <br>
<br>
Please note the * arms embargo* on Israel from the USA, they (Israel) had to sneak planes in, and most of their fighter pilots where commercial pilots.  They started getting training in May 1948, a full year AFTER the war started, and they got their training in CZECKOSOLVAKIA, *not* the USA.<br>
<br>
Now here is the *real* point:<br>
<br>

Last time I checked, reputable references didn't use words like &quot;trounce&quot; in their entries. Cite it, shitheel. Israel received no aid that I know of in 1947, not from the United States.<br>
<br>
Cite. Your. Source.<br>
Or.<br>
Shut. The. Fuck. Up.<br>
<br>
Those Palestinians who had the courage to make it to the kibbutzim walls got their heads blown off by the Haganah. They had zero tactics, and were more interested in betraying each other than actually getting the job done. Even with the British giving strategic advice, the Palestinians embarrassed themselves.<br>
<br>
Looks like things haven't changed much since 1947.<br>
<br>
So cite that source, or take your simpering fanatacism elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Hey, halfwit? Santa isn't real, the Easter bunny is a myth, and politicians lie! Ooh ooh! Make zealot angry, see him shout like monkey! Poor monkey, he blow something up if he no get his way! Wah!<br>

(Oddly enough, Miblis probably thinks he's winning.)<br>

Well this is certainly fun.<br>
<br>
I am at home right now, and I have the source from my earlier quote on my work computer, so tomorrow I will go ahead and post my source for you monkeys.  It's from an editorial titled "Why the Arabs hate the Jews."<br>
<br>
So setting this mini-argument to the side for a moment, I just wanted to explain that neither of you have cited valid arguments whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Great Britain hands someone elses country to the Israelis, because of the Holocaust.  You obviously don't see a problem with this, because you two are both highly ignorant individuals.  You're stupid, to put it bluntly.  Now, being that the Israelis were too weak, too unorganized, and too ignorant, they couldn't just 'take' Palestine.  See, that would take a lot of courage, and take a lot of patience and planning.  Since the Israelis were not able to do anything for themselves, they were handed a free country on a silver platter.<br>
<br>
That's all the help they needed.  So from the very beginning, their country was a lie.  Anything else they have so-called 'accomplished' since then...has been BECAUSE of the country they were handed.<br>
<br>
Do you read about how the Israelis treated Palestinians when they 'moved in'?  Go to the library and find those articles for yourselves.<br>
<br>
So yeah, Israel is a joke.  It always has been.  All major news-agencies are Israel Fanboys.  Anything to cater to the rich Jewish people in our country.  Stop feeling sorry for Israelis.<br>
<br>
They never deserved any of the shit they've been given.  Now they've got it and they're selfish.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, they've never accomplished anything for themselves.  Everything they apparently 'accomplish' is voided by the fact that the country shouldn't belong to them to begin with.<br>
<br>
Have a great night!<br>

<br>
Actually, the Jews bought the land. Even though I'm stupid and ignorant, I'm aware that it was your Moslem brothers, the Turks, who sold them the land.<br>
<br>
You know...the Turks? Ottoman Empire, used Palestine as a share-cropping toilet for centuries? Sold you out.<br>
<br>
So the Turks fucked you, the Brits fucked you, the Jews fucked you, the Arab Legion fucked you, the Yanks fucked you...hell. Maybe you should just take the hint. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;That's all the help they needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh really? NOW that's all they needed? What about the mythological shipments of weapons from America?<br>
<br>
Haha, you sad asshole. Yeah, go find your little article.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you read about how the Israelis treated Palestinians when they 'moved in'?  Go to the library and find those articles for yourselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, I have. I've also read the transcripts of radio broadcasts from the time. Palestinians cheered when the death camps were revealed in Germany. Do I hear the world's smallest violin playing somewhere?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm curious, Miblis. Are you a Palestinian? When did your family leave?<br>
<br>
You know, back in the 40s, a bunch of them fled the country. The rich, and the educated. Took their money and skills and ran...made it alot easier for the Jews to solidify control.<br>
<br>
Got yourself a guilt complex there, boy? Maybe grandpa left the poor ones to the camps, maybe now you beat your chest on the internet to make it all better, huh?<br>
<br>
Alot easier to fight on the internet than to head over there and go up against those Israeli security guys, innit? Half the Jews I know spent a couple of years over there, working the kibbutzim. So maybe it's not just the money, and the guns. Maybe they've got balls, and you don't.<br>

First of all, I am not Palestinian.  You know what else?  My ethnicity should be of no concern to you.  Do I ask you if you're Jewish?  No.  I merely call you an Israeli Cock-sucker, that's it.  Go cry in the corner for all the Israelis that have died...boo goddamn fucking hoo.  You think more Israelis die then Palestinians?<br>
<br>
Oh, and the Turks sold Israel to the Jews, eh?<br>
<br>
<font color=turquoise>On May 14, 1948, Ben-Gurion and his associates proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel. On the following day Britain relinquished the Mandate at 6:00 P.M. and the United States announced de facto recognition of Israel. Soviet recognition was accorded on May 18; by April 1949, fifty-three nations, including Britain, had extended recognition. In May 1949, the UN General Assembly, on recommendation of the Security Council, admitted Israel to the UN. <br>
</font color><br>
<br>
Looks like Great Britain just gave the land to them.  Where in the hell are you getting YOUR information, nutsack?  Want to know where I'm getting mine?<br>

<br>
Ahh and here is the other link you requested....maybe it will offer some insight on <a href=http://www.wwco.com/religion/docs/israel.html>why the Arabs hate the Jews.</a><br>
<br>
Oh and since you were so curious about my ethnicity, I guess I am curious about a few things myself.<br>
<br>
How does it feel to be a bigot?<br>
<br>
Were you or any of your family part of the Klan?<br>
<br>
Do you refer to black people using the 'N' word?<br>
<br>
Do you cringe in disgust when you see an Arabic Family shopping in the grocery store?<br>
<br>
Have you ever set fire to any religious texts?<br>
<br>
<br>
To answer the question you asked me, I am of Iranian descent.  You want to know my feelings on the current situation?  Bin Laden is a fanatical psychopath.  He deserves whatever he gets from the United States.  The Taliban deserves whatever they get from the United States.  Al Queda deserves whatever they get from the United States.  Terrorist organizations worldwide deserve what they receive from the U.S.<br>
<br>
Hamas and Hezbollah?  They deserve to be dealt with by the U.S.<br>
<br>
The PLO?  Nope, they're not a terrorist organization.  They are Palestinian familes and citizens that live under occupation of the Apartheid-State known as Israel.  Israel is the catalyst for all of these conflicts, and the Israeli government needs to be grouped with Terrorist organizations, for our world to be safe, and for people to be treated fairly.<br>
<br>
That's my take.  My ethnicity has nothing to do with it.  I know many Caucasian pure-Americans (if there is such thing) that think the same way I do.  Many people have Jewish friends, therefore, they think Israel is in the right.  Well sorry Jews, and sorry Israel-Fanboys.....the Israeli Government is in the wrong, and they have been for over 50 years.<br>
<br>
Death to Israel?  No.  Death to Apartheid?  Hell fucking yes.<br>
<br>
Bring it, Kytherion....and this time, CITE YOUR SOURCE, dipshit!  Look, I quoted you!<br>

They also host this fascinating page:<br>

<br>
Which I doubt is to be found in the Library of Congress. But let's all make sure we have indepth conversations and pop quizzes with our respective pastors before making any major decisions, yes?<br>
<br>
No weapons shipments, no logistical support from the Americans, my mouth-breathing chum. The Jews sorted out the Arabs in 1947 just fine without any help from us.<br>
<br>
So I guess that's your one reason. Not that you'll notice that you've lost the original argument.<br>
<br>
So unless you have some other source, like one from a non-denominational university, you're SOL.<br>
<br>
(Hint to Miblis: I'm claiming something DOESN'T exist. You can't prove non-existence, hence the failure of science to disprove God and other amusing arguments. I can't cite sources that don't exist about things that don't exist. Thus the total absence of scholarly papers documenting the lack of pink elephants roaming the fields of Kansas.<br>
<br>
The burden of proof is on you, so good luck. Better write that down before your next psychotic fit siezes you and you forget how to work the pencil.)<br>

It's funny reading this, because it almost sounds like you're trying to say that I have been defeated in this argument before.<br>

No one has yet come up with any reason why Palestinians shouldn't have a country....through all the months of arguing this.<br>
<br>
Which means....nope.  I've not been defeated.  You all have resorted to wordplay and games to try to win your side of the argument.  It's obvious there is no logic that fully backs the Israeli side.  No logic at all.<br>

Plus, you did the man enough thing, Trech.  When I asked you to elaborate earlier, you were man enough to step away from the argument because you were wrong.....unlike Warangel1 and Kytherion.<br>

<br>
Your US government source doesn't &quot;destroy&quot; the Turk thing.<br>
<br>
Because, nowhere in that source, does it say how the Jews came to actually acquire the land. The UN resolution merely confirmed that the Jews had a right to own the land, which they had already bought.<br>
<br>
Try and work with me, Einstein.<br>
<br>
1. Palestine controlled by Ottoman Turks until the end of WW1. TITLES to the land are held primarily by wealthy Turks, who are absentee landlords.<br>
<br>
2. British assume control of Palestine following WW1. Those Turkish landlords, being private citizens, continue to hold that property under British law.<br>
<br>
3. Prior, during and especially after WW2, Jewish refugees purchase said land from both Turks and wealthy Palestinians who flee the country.<br>
<br>
Your source doesn't address who owned title to Palestinian land, not at any point. It says absolutely nothing about private ownership. NOTHING.<br>
<br>
IT'S NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN YOUR SOURCE, FUCKTARD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now. I'm a bigot and a rascist because I assumed you might be Palestinian? Nope, not a bigot, just incorrect.<br>
<br>
You're just a Palestinian 'fanboy'.<br>
<br>
&quot;I merely call you an Israeli Cock-sucker, that's it.  Go cry in the corner for all the Israelis that have died...boo goddamn fucking hoo.&quot;<br>
<br>
At least twice, I've stated that I do not agree with Israeli policies on most things. But because I don't agree with YOU, I'm an 'Israeli Cock-sucker'.<br>
<br>
You're a fanatic, Miblis. Anyone who doesn't agree with you is the enemy.<br>
<br>
You're like the super right-wing Republican candidate, Miblis. Just a little too scary to vote for, the moderates stay away. And as long as they do, you'll never have a chance.<br>
<br>
As I've said, people like you are the reason the Palestinians will never see justice. No one sane would ever give people like yourself control of a country...and more often than not, it's people like you that are sent to negotiate. It's a shame, the Palestinians are nice people for the most part.<br>

Well so far we have proved that you're a liar and you grossly distort history to support your ideas.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Which means....nope. I've not been defeated. You all have resorted to wordplay and games to try to win your side of the argument.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually we've mostly presented historical facts, while you have presented what can be called at best pro-palestinian editorials by individuals, who have no credibitliy,  running personal websites.  You've consistantly lied about certain things, even in the face of overwhelming evidence (ie the arms embargo on Israel in the 1940s).  <br>
<br>
You've also lied about the way Israel formed up, and why the british left.  Bottom line is, the British were getting whacked by both the Palestinians and the Jews.  <br>
<br>
When they left, the plan was to seperate Israel into Palestinian and Jewish territories.  So, the Palestinians would have their own land under that plan.<br>
<br>
from :<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch23zsrl.html">www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch23zsrl.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
&quot;On the day of the partition vote, November 29, 1947, an Arab &quot;liberation army,&quot; aided by civilians,  launched a war against the Jews across Palestine. Jews in  Jerusalem were besieged and threatened with starvation. British policy was pacifist oriented, against the violence of either side, and blocked the sending of arms that Jews could have used to defend themselves. This was also the position of well-meaning Americans in Washington D.C.  The United States had a vast reservoir of weapons left over from World War II but refused to allow any of it to be sent to the Jews of Palestine. &quot;<br>
<br>
Again, notice how the US and Brits did not help the Israelis.  By any account, the Palestinians and their Arab friends should have been able to wipe out the Jews.  They were, however, unable to take out the Israelis even with the help of regular military forces from nearby Arab states (esp Egypt).  A bunch of hungry, penniless, and frightened Jews defeated 5 arab countries and the Palestinians.<br>
<br>
Well the bottom line is that the Palestinians wanted it all or nothing, and when faced with having to co-exist with the Jews they attacked what they thought would be an easy target..<br>
<br>
They got their butts kicked.<br>
<br>
They deserve nothing, because they initiated the war.<br>
<br>
The Israeli's won, to the victor go the spoils.  <br>
<br>
The inability of the Palestinian people to agree on methods of solving their problems without resorting to violence, a trait demonstrated over and over again,  just proves that they still deserve nothing.<br>

<br>
&quot;By 1947 Palestine was a major trouble spot in the British Empire, requiring some 100,000 troops and a huge maintenance budget. On February 18, 1947, Bevin informed the House of Commons of the government's decision to present the Palestine problem to the United Nations (UN). On May 15, 1947, a special session of the UN General Assembly established the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), consisting of eleven members. The UNSCOP reported on August 31 that a majority of its members supported a geographically complex system of partition into separate Arab and Jewish states...&quot;<br>
<br>
This supports everything I've posted so far to a T.<br>
<br>
The plan was to partition the region for jews and Arabs.<br>
<br>
The plan was put forward and approved by the UN.<br>
<br>
Britain just wanted to get the fuck out, and didnt care much what happened after that.<br>
<br>
The US and European countries did NOT back Israel.<br>
<br>
The day after this was enacted (May 15, 1947) the Palestinians and 5 arab states attacked the Jewish areas.  <br>
<br>
The Iraelis defeated the far larger and better equipped agressors, and the Palestinians lost their land for their foolish and violent attacks.<br>
<br>
Once again, you are shown to be decietful and sadly misguided by the propaganda you have bought off onto for so long.<br>
<br>
This much I will acceed to though.  You can't have a nation of people without a home.  No one in the middle east wants to give them a home (Jordan tried and wound up in a war with the PLO in 1973), and indeed most appear to be more interested in turning them into suicide bombers.  It's also apparent that they cannot co-exist with Israel.  They need to be relocated someplace where they are of no danger to themselves or anyone else, given some decent land to call their own, and allowed to rebuild something of value if they are capable.<br>
<br>
I doubt they would ever agree to that though, they'd rather be killing Israelis.<br>
<br>
That's about all the concession you'll get from me.<br>
