I only shouted it once per zone, so I did not spam anything.<br>
<br>
I gave armor to newbies, was polite to anybody that was kind, and if anybody messed with me or I fooled with somebody, would duke it out. Not like some level 8 who stands in front of a level 60 and insults them. I always took on my duels because if I could get them past half or a quarter being level 20 and them being 50, I won a small victory in training for duels.<br>
<br>
I never scammed players or trained anybody. I have always been fair in my dealings and tend not to hunt in groups, but like working solo or with a partner.<br>
<br>
And if anybody has any REAL proof to say otherwise, present it. Not just a &quot;U Suck you big lamer.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I seem really jumpy about people making fun of the Dragon Ladies or any of our members, but that has a lot of open wounds for me. We gave, we were mocked. We role-played, we were mocked more. And some of it was just to be cruel. &quot;u r a lesbians. u r men.&quot; kind of things, just from people who want to get kicks.<br>
<br>
I considered leaving the game a few times, but why do it because of losers like that? I came to EQ looking for a new place to role-play because my old homes of Neverwinter Nights, Dark Sun Online, and Yseribus were gone. It even took me a while to write role-play stories again. <br>
<br>
I ended the Dragon Ladies because I was just investing so much heart into something that was failing. All my friends I started it with left because they did not like how they were treated, and others came to just feed off the guild. Although some Dragon Ladies were said to be very rude or do bad things, nobody ever mentioned the name of one who did. Some Sisters Without Mercy accused one of my members of training them in Crushbone, but not only did they not know a name, they could not name the member who was trained. I think they only really wished to make a reason to not have ties with us. I knew speaking to a few of them that they were having the same troubles as DL. People would insult them and make fun of them.<br>
<br>
I am not sure if it was the role-play that offended people (because in ooc I always kept saying &quot;It is role-play, not personal.&quot;) or the fact we had male slaves in the guild. Dragon Ladies did not hate men, or believed in hating men, just part of our charter that they role-played dominant women. GMs thought it was real cute.<br>
<br>
I think what was really threatening to some people was that the guild was women, simply put. That scared some people. You know how often things like WNBA or NOW are made fun of constantly? Since these were just women and people felt like we thought we were better, they just got kicks off degrading us.<br>
<br>
There is a new guild in Norrath that is all women---Sisterhood of Power. Although I do not know much about them, I warned their leader about my encounter and told her to be tough, and I am sorry if she is stereotyped by anything the Dragon Ladies were accused of.<br>
<br>
Although some of the things I did (like with KHS, I will not get into those) were not right, and took a long time to get over, I think I had a good standing with a lot of people. I think my friends today would acknowledge I am not some hardened cruel feminist.<br>
<br>
So please, if you just heard about this guild called the Dragon Ladies and heard &quot;Oh, they suck&quot; from somebody, shut your mouth. Because not only do you not know anything about them, but they were honest people. I don't remember them KSing constantly, or announcing their spawn rotations, scamming, or cheating others like so many other guilds are known for. They just were women.<br>
<br>
So if you want to flame this post, or reply in a bad manner, put a list of things we did wrong in your post that was bad and dishonest. Do that instead of some lame post of insults and typos. Why? Because we never did anything bad. And if you whip out nothing but insults, that only proves that we did nothing and that you are an immature child.<br>

his bio? Pretty funny I thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate dragon ladies.&quot;<br>
<br>
I thought that was so freaking hilarious. But personaly, I have never had any problems and I even role played with one of the dragon ladies. But one thing that did make me mad, was when there where about 10 dragon ladies in zone, and one of them started a Hail Dragon Ladies, which all of the other guild mates followed up with a Hail Dragon Ladies, and then people told them to shut up after seeing Dragon Ladies cross their screen ten times, then long arguements of rights to Role play would commence, and I'd either zone out or turn off the channels.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that you are a bad guild, but I am saying that EQ is not a sutible game to RP in, for one, alot of 10 year olds that are just rude to everyone tend to like to mess around with anyone acting wierd or different, roleplaying. Another would be that the game is designed around loot and levels, you have to go around the whole design of the game in order to RP, I know, most of my life was spent RP'ing.<br>
<br>
Just do what most of the RP'ers did and move on is my advice, RP is struggling along, barely surviving. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukaraithecatgirl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karai The CatGirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/25/01 6:05:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragon Ladies</span><hr size=1> Well Elnots, I am glad you said nice things about us.

What really made me laugh though, wasn't the fact that I owned Karai in a duel (I was 6 levels higher, but I don't win duels too often, so give me a break) but it was the fact that the four dragon ladies who watched her go down proceeded to, all simultaneously, flip me the /bird.<br>

<br>
Karai I have never heard of the Dragon Ladies, but I am sorry to hear about them disbanding.  Though I wouldn't agree with some of the more dominating aspects of your guild, its sad to see a female guild plunder.  Only thing I really want to bring to this thread aside from the standard Elnots bashing would be.. You can't expect men to treat you equally if your not willing to do the same.  <br>
<br>
I see nothing wrong with an female based guild, but dont expect the men to be pleased about the &quot;male slave aspect&quot;<br>

<br>
It wasn't merely a group of 14 folks shouting &quot;Hail, Dragon Ladies&quot; on occasion, it was a concerted effort to disrupt a zone, and any character who came across your path.  When requested nicely to cool it a bit, your inevitable response to was to crank up the volume, drag a personal tell to shouts and proceed to act even worse.  Wish I still had some of the logs from GFay, but YOU, you and you alone made me avoid that zone for several months.  <br>
<br>
It was your attitude that if someone didn't like it, they should turn off their chat channels to avoid it.  So, I often ended up doing that, just to avoid hearing your monopoly of the chat channels.  It wasn't just shout, either.  It was OOC, auction, anything you and your crew could do to disrupt, it seems you did.  You seemed to think that if everyone didn't agree with YOU, they could lump it.  <br>
<br>
Where there's smoke, there's fire.  If SO many people complained and SO many people avoided you and disliked DL, could you not see there was a problem with the way both you and your guild members handled themselves?<br>
<br>
I personally witnessed DL ladies badgering &quot;male&quot; characters several levels younger than themselves, one memorable one going so far as to call someone about 10 levels below them a coward for not dueling her.  I witnessed your guild members begging from higher levels, and being insulting when they weren't accomodated.<br>
<br>
Was it that you were an RP guild? Nope, it was the fact that you shoved your version of RP down everyone's throat whether they were interested or not.<br>

<br>
Many people I know remember the Dragon Ladies, and not fondly I might add.  Granted, there were some genuinely nice people in the guild, but the main thing everyone remembers is not the guild members, but Karai's shouting across every zone, especially GFay, exclaiming how wonderful and great she was and how horrible men were.  Yeah, you can claim you were roleplaying but that's pretty much in the category of the person who acts like an asshole, doesn't care about anyone, scams people, and then claims he's roleplaying.  Sorry, not buying that.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, I can't remember one single person's name in the Dragon Ladies, except Karai's .. so they may have received a bad name because of their *cough* leader. <p>Tormentcia

<br>
Your constant zone disruption irritated me to the point where I considered buying a dog, naming him after you, and kicking him square in the ribs any time I ran across your sorry ass.  <br>
<br>
If you wre roleplaying a human, puss infected pimple, then I would have to give you credit for your success.  Since you seemed to be aiming in different directions with your actions, I will have to label you as a bad actor and an all around turd without an ounce of creativity and a penchant for pedophilia.  <br>

<br>
If you call shouting every little useless bit of information that floats into your head roleplaying, then yes, it was the roleplaying that bothered us.<br>
<br>
I bit my tongue out of courtesy for Attica when she came into #emarr and claimed DL was treated unfairly and that they were just a bunch of girls that wanted to roleplay.  Clearly your feelings were hurt, and I didn't want to add on it.  My patience has it's limits, though. To drag this into a public forum and assert that people didn't (and still don't) have the right nor reason to reproach and oppose your ex-guild is arrogant.  Your members might have been courteous on a personal level, but on a public scale they were viewed as childish and annoying at most because of their actions. <br>
<br>
If roleplaying itself was the issue, then why haven't we attacked KHS, Obsidian Brotherhood, Children of Darkness, Sanhedrin, and a multitude of other RP guilds based on this bias?  It was how the roleplay was carried out that bothered people.  It was the abuse of the /shout function.<br>
<br>
On a lighter note... even Guard Fireblight was fed up with the spuh-am!<br>
<br>
Take a look-see!<br>
