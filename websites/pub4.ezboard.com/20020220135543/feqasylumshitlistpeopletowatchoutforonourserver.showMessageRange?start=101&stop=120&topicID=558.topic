You may say that &quot;I don't want to lose an RL friend over EQ,&quot; but he certainly doesn't seem like he cares how you feel.  <br>
<br>
Frankly, I doubt many people believe the &quot;two players&quot; excuse.  But, I'm willing to.  The problem being, there, is that YOU have the power to create a new character.  YOU have the power to return these things.  YOU have the power to say to your friend, &quot;quit giving me a bad rep,&quot; and if he IS your friend, he will agree and acquiesce to your request.  A FRIEND will make reparations on your behalf.<br>
<br>
If it is &quot;only a game,&quot; that is to say that there is no emotional investment, only a series of GUI codes which wastes life, then it means nothing to stop scamming, to give these items back.  It will cost him nothing and you nothing to stop what you're doing and just make full plat restitution.  It will not affect your play to stop scamming...it will not matter, because all it is, EQ, is a simple diversion which means nothing to you.<br>
<br>
If it is not, meaning that there is emotional investment on either you or your friend's behalf, that you see it as more than a generic time waster, then it means something to stop scamming.  Your &quot;friend&quot; is obviously ruining your time, as you seem to devote a lot of time defending your action here as well as in EQ.  Your &quot;friend&quot; has taken the entire body of work that is leveling and gathering the equipment for your troll and basically thrown it into the toilet.  I don't know about you, but I can't stand wasted time, and that's what has happened with Luminescence.<br>
<br>
If you truly want to repent, then leave the character to him.  period.  Make one of your own, and show everyone a different face than the one you appear to be showing both here and in EQ.  If you are sincere in your apologies, then that means you are not as amoral as you seem to want people to think you are.  If you are sincere, then start fresh, send the people you wish to repay a tell indicating who you now are, and make reparations this way.<br>
<br>
Frankly, your whole argument about &quot;well he let me&quot; is flawed.  You &quot;let&quot; people KS you.  Is that right?  You &quot;let&quot; people spam and curse you.  Is that right?  You &quot;let&quot; EQ kill you character when a monster is too powerful for you to defeat.  Is that right?  By the same token, applied in RL terms, a lot of people &quot;let&quot; other people murder them.  A lot of people who live in terror &quot;let&quot; their oppressors make them afraid.  You had full control of the situation, from beginning to end.  You had the right and ability to make reparations on the spot (or at least your friend did).  You had the right and ability to make reparations every other time someone confronted you about it.  And yet, you did not.  You claim that you'd be ruining your relationship with your &quot;friend.&quot;  Well, I'd say he ruined it FIRST by putting you in this unenviable position.  And if he would hold it against you that you made right what he did wrong, then maybe you need someone who'll be more of a friend and more of a person.<br>
<br>
You are at least party to his actions.  You may not be helping him (although it looks like you are), but you are at least preventing justice and NOT preventing further INjustice.  By standing by and letting him commit fraud and such, you are as much at fault as he.  By not taking matters into your own hands, and standing up for your principles, you are endorsing his actions - If you truly SHARE the character, then you should have at least as much say as your &quot;friend&quot; does.  If he has the freedom to commit injustice with this shared character, then you have the freedom to be just with it as well.<br>
<br>
However, this all also assumes that you have a &quot;friend&quot; with whom you share the character.<br>
<br>
If you are in fact the sole runner of the character, then perhaps you should simply stop responding, stop scamming, and just repay the people you have wronged, if you are truly repentant.  Don't try to defend yourself, because by repenting, you admit wrongdoing by trying to atone for your crimes.  If you are not repentant, then stop defending yourself because it gives others' views a validity that you yourself are not willing to admit.<br>
<br>
BOTTOM LINE: You have the power to make things right and to stop doing things (or being a party to doing things) wrong.  Stop defending yourself with excuses and either make it right or ignore the social structures of the game.<br>

Yes Luminescence we are not as stupid as you are or as you think. We did read that on your first post that there is supposedly another player on that one character but you know what? No One cares Luminescence because that Troll no matter who is behind it is a worthless piece of crap from the sewer and needs to be deleted or we will all delight in watching you play the game solo. <br>
If YOU really cared about the reputation of Luminescence that this supposed friend is ruining, than when YOU are in that character YOU would be doing the right thing and returning the wurmslayer and now all that other gear which I now believe none of it was truly earned but scammed from people. But instead you come to the boards in a pathetic attempt to get people to &quot;feel sorry&quot; for you OH poor baby! I have never in all my time in Norrath run across such scum as you are.<br>
Ther is NOTHING now that you can say that will make people change their minds. YOU sound like a broken record now and you show your true colors again when you log into Norrath. I dont care if 10 ppl play Luminescence I will NEVER do any business or help in any way to Luminescence for as long as I continue to play. <br>

I ran up behind her and went to target her for a Sow and an invite, when quick as a flash he runs in between us.  I check, and sure enough HE's targetted.  I ducked to abort that cast.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I can only guess he was hoping to interrupt a trade or something by stepping between us.  Judging from his post here, that wouldn't surprise me in the least.<br>

umm you're giving us the chance to figure that out? Oh thank you ever so much, I was afraid my time was running out to believe your lies. <br>
<br>
That actually sounds like a little threat to me actually, so umm what happens if we don't &quot;figure out&quot;?<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, you are one of the lowest scumbags I have ever seen on the server. This bullshit of &quot;um it wasn't me, it was someone else...no really&quot; takes the cake. Then saying that since it was indeed someone else you aren't allowed to give it back...heh that is a good one.  <br>

Nothing.  I still have the wyrmslayer, I'm not going to give it back, I'm not going to pay for it, because I'm a lier, a thief, and a cheat.  You guys just keep posting and making screenshots of me, stupid stalkers.  Post everything I say, mess it up with picture editors so I sound worse, it doesn't matter.  I win, and you lose.  Fuck morals, I'm awesome.  I've got a wurmslayer, and I'm soloing with it.  I'm not hurt by your reputation killing, but I was hoping to avoid it.  Nope.  Fuck you.  Fuck it.  You shitbags are worthless garbage.  One think you were right about, I was wasting my time posting on this board.  You people suck too much.  Buy that twink a new goddamn wurmslayer.  I'm the master and I'll continue to be the master.  I win, and you all lose.  Way to go.  Now let's see what all I've accomplished.<br>
<br>
1.  I've got a wurmslayer.<br>
2.  I'm famous(imfamous, but it's the same.)<br>
3.  I'm strong.<br>
<br>
This is all I care about.  Thanks for making it happen.  Good luck in stringing up the next person who does something bad.  I know I will be behind him all the way.<br>

And yes dont you get it? we are sick of all you people that steal and take advantage of mistakes and people. We are sick of the scammers and we are sick of you making other peoples life miserable. It's all about respect Lum and you did not respect anyone when you stole that weapon I hope you wield that the rest of your time on this server you've earned your &quot;trophy&quot; well! <br>

Luminesence we dont put up with that crap on this server. <br>

If they weren't, why do they have the same user-name on the ez boards. Why do they both write in the same way, and both seem to have the intellectual capasity of an 8-year-old. <br>
<br>
And even if they're not, it don't matter. The character, Luminescence is RUINED. every time I EVER see you in my zone, I'll make SURE no one buys, sells, helps, or groups with you. I've got plenty or clerics, wizzies, and druids as friends; I have made sure that they NEVER give you ports or rezzes. I'll tell ALL of my friends to NEVER help your character in ANY way. Ok I may not know that many people on my own, but guess what sunshine, I won't be the only one doing this. All the people you scammed, they will do the same. I Guaran-damn-tee that you won't get much help for the rest of the time you are in the game.<br>
<br>
And one thing, Munden may be a bigger asshole than you, but at least he was smart enough to choose a class that can solo; he's a druid. You, the dumbass you are, choose a WARRIOR; man ur dumb. Well, have fun soloing; you know; without heals, buffs, mezzes, DD's, other tanks taunting, stuns, etc. And don't even think about any raids; the ONLY way to get good equip. Bottom line, enjoy your pathetic low lvls now, you'll be in that range for a WHILE<br>
