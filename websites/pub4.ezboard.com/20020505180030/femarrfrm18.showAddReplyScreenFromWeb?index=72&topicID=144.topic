Wonder will know when your hypocrisy will end.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you this, you come across as hostile and you support the Palestine regime. ergo. you just come across as another hostile arab. If it's a fact it's not racism. Only the manner in which it is displayed makes something racist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is a textbook case of racism. Think about it, Kerryn....you walk into your grocery store, and you see a Muslim family, with the wife covered and the male with a thick black mustache and beard....a few kids at their sides....they are speaking Arabic with eachother.....what do you think about? Do you just...walk by them and go to the dairy section where you were headed....<br>
<br>
Nah, you think about those people. What kind of people they are. You think about the suicide bombings....at least for a split second. You think about Osama Bin Laden, and his blowing up American Embassies....you think about that.<br>
<br>
You don't just walk by another family shopping at a grocery store.<br>
<br>
It's racists like you that are responsible for everything. Interesting, I just switched it on you, and justified it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No it's not interesting. It's you thinking you have justified calling me racist by one statement, and that statement<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> you think about that.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->makes you the worlds first confirmed psychic. I went to a school in Manchester full of muslim and black families. I grew up learning about Diwali and Eid ( I apologize for my ignorance of not knowing how to spell eid ) surrounded by muslim people and not once did I think of bombings. The first time I thought about suicide bombings was when Martigan started his post on suicide bombings and you piped in with your justification then too. Want me to tell you what really interests me?? Are the suicide bombers thinking this as they walk into that crowded restaurant &quot;They all hate me, they all think of me as an Arab bomber&quot; Are THEY all as psychic as you are?<br>
<br>
You should have just stated in Martigans thread that whilst you normally supported the Arabs that bombing was despicable. Instead you started this whole &quot;well they don't own the land and it will stop as soon as they leave&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My house belongs to me. I didn't throw the previous family out and take it, renovate it, add a sunroom to it, drop a swimming pool in the backyard, then claim it to be mine just because I did those things. So the above statement from you, Kerryn, is unfortunately just ignorant. Perhaps you were angry, and that's why you said it. Not sure what your intentions were with that, heh. My dollars are on your prejudice toward me, and all middle eastern people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually it makes you ignorant I think because you completely missed the point that no matter who the house belongs to, once you use it as a weapon you forfeit your right to it. I dont care if your great great greart great granny esmerelda bought it 300 years ago and you have the title deeds to prove it. I'm not angry Miblis, a little frustrated by how brainwashed you are is about all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The media is primarily American/British owned. That's your stereotype. That's your belief. That's why you are nothing, but a racist sheep, Kerryn.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The only channels you actually receive anywhere outside the UK that is UK made is the BBC and the BBC world service. The americans own a fair bit but you'll find Europe has its own news stations. So too does China and Japan, Australia and more. That covers most of the occupied continents. North Africa is slowly building its television and radio network and anywhere below that on the map is either too preoccupied by whats happening in it's own backyard or has not progressed to that level yet.<br>
<br>
Considering we really have so little control over whats going on in the news other then on our own little island why is it that other societies other then British, Israeli and American think the Palestinians are the agressors here? Now whilst I don't say that being part of a majority makes you right, being part of such a small minority should really make you think about coming down off the cloud you're on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the fact is that the land still doesn't belong to them<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is sad, since the land is theirs to begin with.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yada yada yada. Mind if I nod off? You've said that 57 times in the last two threads. Over and over again you claim the land belongs to Palestine but you still don't have anything other then this as a basis for an argument. So it belonged to them 52 years ago. It belonged to Jews before. It belonged to someone else before that and now it belongs to Israel again. But that doesn't give any of them a right to it.<br>
<br>
Miblis, you come across as a robot, an agressive and possibly fanatical Arab who honestly believes that Arabs own the land and are justified in killing for it. At the end of the day I don't care who owns the land but you wont get to govern it while their is violence to the goverment that controls it. Either way your a stuck record so I'm not going to respond to you after this. If you don't mind I'll chat with Ujulain.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My wish? That Israel ceases to be Israel and becomes the nation of commingled people it was for 2500 years before the British and the US played map making on an ugly scale. Believe it or not, Hebrew, Arab, Assyrian, Armenian, Cypriot, Turk, etc, lived in relative amity during this occasion. It took the genius of Balfour and his buddies and the evil of Adolf Hitler to bring it down.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree totally. But it's not going to happen whilst Palestinians are murdering people. I would hope that the area comes under a new rule, with both Israelis and Palestines jointly but I know it's not going to happen soon. I hope that British cartography can help in a fair way but nobodys going to shift any lines on a map at the moment.<br>
<br>
I'd also like for Northern Ireland to sort itself out and to fall under a new Northern Irish rule. For gods sake the English aren't doing a good job of it but be buggered if we're going to give it to the republic just because the IRA is blowing up the local McDonalds in Warrington.<br>
<br>
In both cases, stop the killing and we'll sit down and talk. I got lucky. When the bomb went off in Manchester the only thing damaged was the paintwork on my car that was showered in half a ton of glass, but to those that lost friends, family, people I knew it sickens me. Anyway, I digress.....<br>
<br>
I think you're wrong when you say if you mention Israels and the Jews your racist. Maybe it's true I don't know but if that's your experience then who am I to refute it. I would like to think that we can sit at our keyboards and talk about it.<br>
<br>
You're also right when you say that we don't want to forget what happened to the Jewish. But I don't think the holocaust should ever be forgotten. I may be ignorant of some of the other wars your talking about ergarding the turkish and all and feel free if you wish to expand my education but people over here have relatives killed by the germans, jewish friends, and such and for that it rings closer to home.<br>
<br>
This generation wont be the last to harp on about WWII but in time the stain that is still afforded to the Germans by the older generation will passwith them. I hold no enmity towards Germans. As this happens people will chalk up the holocaust and the destruction of the Jews to another generation to a lesson learnt. I dont think we don't want to forget just to invoke that guilt you talk of. Perhaps others do I don't know.<br>
<br>
You mention that Japan still teaches it's children that America was the agressor in WWII. I have to say I don't understand this. What you say astounds me because I realise the extent you'd have to go to to this to make it work. Which is not to say I disbelieve you. I am just astounded by that.<br>
<br>
You have to remove all the history books and all the films, you have to stop people getting access at American newspapers from that time, British newspapers. You have to silence anyone who speaks anything other then the truth, cut relevant access to the net, the list goes on.<br>
<br>
I understand that there are some American's who think that the war lasted for 2 years and America was involved from the start. Some Americans think that they won the war for us. I spoke to an American girl when I was grouped in Mistmoore one day who told me the British were stupid for not napalming france and germany,  instead sending soliders to die on french shores. But thats ignorance and not brainwashing as you mention in Japan or as I see in Miblis. Its a different thing.<br>
<br>
There are holes in my learning and I need to fill them. But one thing I'm sure of. The Arabs are not doing a lot to help themself and I can't argue with the way the Israeli government have reacted.<br>
<br>
Fill me in on something will you. The particular piece of land we're talking about. We know it as Israel. What do Arabs call it and what has it been known as historically? <p><HTML><CENTER>

<br>
Along with being a racist, which you have not disproven in any part of your last post.....you are now a pathological liar. Basically, you are lying about something that has obviously been proven not true earlier in these discussions.<br>
<br>
Oh what?  You don't understand what I'm talking about?  Do you remember how I said...."nothing justifies killing"?<br>
<br>
Do you remember that at all?  Put the crackpipe down, take a few deep breaths, and think about it.  Do you remember at what points I stated that nothing justifies killing?  Oh you don't remember?<br>
<br>
You don't belong in this thread, and you have overstayed your welcome.  Go ahead and begin agreeing with things I have been saying all along while you go talk to Ulujain.<br>

<br>
Well, in a previous thread, the first thing out of Caoilfhionn's keyboard in response to exactly what I'm writing here were terms like I mentioned; anti-Semitic, etc...see? Even here, in this insignificant corner of the Web, you cannot have a debate with the subject of Israel in it without the usual name-throwing. The State of Israel needs to lose its &quot;protected species&quot; status with a few people before these issues can be dealt with sanely and without name-calling. I stated then, and I will state now, I have nothing against the Jewish faith, or the Hebrew people. I am firmly against the concept of the State of Israel. It, like the former &quot;Bantustans&quot; of South Africa, are a creation to appease one class out of many; hence its innate unfairness to those there already. <br>
<br>
The Palestinians have nowhere else to go. The area has been their home since the time of Christ and beyond. To suddenly be told, sorry, but your Semitic cousins the Hebrews, and those who follow their faith, Judaism, are now your Government and your rulers would come as an awful surprise to anyone.<br>
<br>
The idea that Arabs are a homogenous people too is far from the truth. The Turks overran them on the divide and conquer principle. They were (and remain to some extent) tribes. The Palestinians can't just get up and move to Saudi Arabia or Egypt because their &quot;Arab brothers&quot; are there. Not going to happen.<br>
<br>
The area where the State of Israel has been called Palestine for a long, long time. The name &quot;Palestine&quot; has no Arab background. It is a Latin derivation of a Greek work for the Phoenicians. Phillistia.<br>
<br>
The Romans called it Judaea. I'm not sure what the Turks referred to it as when it was a mere vilayet. Maybe just Palestine.<br>
<br>
As such it is, technically, a neutral name. Or it should be.<br>
