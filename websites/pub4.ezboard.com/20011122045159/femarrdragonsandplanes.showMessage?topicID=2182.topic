So if someone won a quest breastplate from Kael arena, they would have to give the group they were with their Trakanon breastplate because the quest breastplate is better? Sorry, this isn't right.  If the people in the group weren't there to help you get the item you were using before you got this new upgrade, then why should they be entitled to it?  When I get an upgrade in equipment, I give my hand me downs (if they are good enough) to my guildmates.  Most of the time that is where I got them originally so I feel it is only fair.  If the item that I am upgrading isn't an upgrade to a guildmate, I sell it. <br>
<br>
If I were in a group that told me I had to give up my Fungi tunic if I won an upgrade to it, I would leave.  If I win an upgrade to my tunic I would rather give it to a guildmate or keep it for soloing purposes (that regen rocks) than to give it to total strangers (sorry if that sounds greedy, but it took a lot of work back when OS wasn't camped all the time to get that thing).<br>

<br>
First of all NBG was designed to eliminate the sick trends that had developed in LGuk for over two years, where casters would walk out all day long with an FBSS and some poor monk or warrior would spend 30-60 plus hours before he even came close to winning a random.  Nothing more frustrating than to be in on roll number 18 for a FBSS and see it go to UBER_NECRO001, then have him send you a tell saying &quot;Dude, you got 9k plat I will sell it to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Its a matter of fact that several classes becuase of their viability at the art or soloing can generate much more cash than most melee classes at higher levels if they want to spend the time.  I remember playing my Heretic and dropping Gorgul Paclok in BW by myself and thinking &quot;SCORE..easy 4k plat!!&quot;  I would not even think of trying that with my monk and hes 3 levels higher now.  <br>
<br>
So when a group says ok loot rules FFA honor, NBG on rares Im very happy with it.  Cause it keeps item &quot;Pharmers&quot; from ganking an item they have no need for and then trying to gouge the prices on it against someones meager bank role.  I think Trech said it very well...if you dont like the drops where you are hunting..and have gotten your panties bunched becuase someone who needed the item actually got it, then leave.  You can VERY easily be replaced by someone with more honor and someone who wants to play for the enjoyment of the game..not trying to see who they can screw over by ganking their items on a roll.<br>
<br>
I'm not just bitching about casters here..this goes for tanks that want to roll on caster items too..thats just lame.  Soo...in the end I think the best solution for you..if you dont like NBG..is to go back to LGuk and park yourself in frenzy and pharm away.   The majority of Kunark and Velious High end dungeons will laugh your ass out when you insist on rolling on a warrior item when there is a warrior in group that needs it.<br>

I think your problem is more a problem of being frustrated with lack of drops for your class...in which case i recommend you head to PoG and try for some new stuff there =)<br>

This server originally started that way and then as us older chars grew out of the dungeons and newblood moved in they enforced their own rules...which turned it into the lguk you spoke of...where people wanted anything that dropped.<br>
<br>
To those that wonder why NBG..well let's put it this way.  You want an item for you class? Go camp it.  If you go to a camp that drops -nothing- for your class...that's your own choice and it's not like you're not getting anything.  You joined the group for xp..if you're getting xp..stfu.  <br>
<br>
See that's how the system's supposed to work..but nowadays people just want to camp anywhere..grab what loot they can and then sell for what they really wanted.  If you want a heiro cloak don't go camp the shroom king...camp where the item you want drops and there's no need to bitch about nbg.  Trust me, people will exploit greed before need alot easier than need before greed.  At least NBG is a decent way to allocate xp-group loot....the other way around a person could get in groups for the same camp everyday and just keep randoming for the item. <br>
<br>
If you got people saying they need something when they don't just so they can put it on an alt and sell...you need to find new people to group with and blackball the greedyass loser to the point where his own alt won't group with him anymore. <p><center><i><b><font size="3" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="red">Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</i></b></font></font><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarryen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arryen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 366<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/01 5:46:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> I personally disagree with NBG for the following reasons:<br>
<br>
1) If everyone has spent 8 hours sitting in a room killing frogs, everyone should have the same chance of getting something out of it.<br>

<br>
Point 1) If everyone has spent 8 hours sitting in a room killing frogs, everyone should have the same chance of getting something out of it.<br>
<br>
Answer 1) You are...you're getting the xp you joined the group for.<br>
<br>
Point 2) If everyone went only to places that dropped things they could use, most places would be uncampable. There'd be no int casters in Karnor's, for instance. The argument of &quot;you help us because otherwise we won't help you&quot; is fine in guilds or groups of friends, but doesn't make sense when you're fighting with random people you may well never see again.<br>
<br>
Answer 2) See Answer 1...people will go for the xp<br>
<br>
Point 3) Anyone can sell any item and thereby buy something they can use, and quite possibly &quot;need&quot; more than the person recieving the NBG'd item.<br>
<br>
Answer 3) In all actuality no one &quot;needs&quot; any piece of loot, thereby no one can really &quot;need&quot; some other item totally unrelated to the one dropped more than the person who can wear it.  It's apples and oranges.  MS is on giant faction..why? Because the armor has higher AC than the others and more AC on the tanks helps the guild more than the extra stats on SS.  Does that mean they &quot;need&quot; the AC more than I would &quot;need&quot; the extra 30 mana on icicle pants than invoker has? Nope because they're totally unrelated.<br>
<br>
Point 4) I have yet to hear a coherent argument for NBG in pickup groups that doesn't rely entirely on abusing words like &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;whore&quot;.<br>
<br>
Answer 4) Kinda hard not to use the word greed when the acronym has the word Greed in it.  Other than that I believe you just heard an argument of that manner from my earlier post.  The only references towards the loot whores being stated at the end in mentioning those who abuse or cheat this policy are greedy assholes. <p><center><i><b><font size="3" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="red">Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</i></b></font></font><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umorphiusthejeweller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorphiusTheJeweller</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/01 7:46:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> NBG is good in theory, terrible in practice.<br>
<br>
Proof - Go to the &quot;items&quot; section on this board.  A large percentage of items that are for sale on this board were probably obtained using NBG.  You can buy CoF's, white dragon scales, as well as other raid obtained items.  I'm pretty sure that these items were not given to that person with the knowledge it was going to end up for sale here, or in EC.<br>
<br>
&quot;Need&quot; does not equal &quot;can equip&quot;.  If you will be replacing that item in future, then you did not &quot;need&quot; it.  It was more of a &quot;will hold me until I get better, then I can sell it for big profits&quot;.<br>
<br>
NBG only works with guildmates, friends, and no-drop items.  If you truly think you &quot;need&quot; to obtain a particular piece of gear, then go with friends and guildmates to obtain it.  If it's a pick-up group, then droppable items should be randomed to all.<br>

A lot of people seem to assume that NBG is delivered wisdom from heaven.  It isn't.  In many cases, NBG is the loot whore's best friend.  And in many other cases, NBG is unfair because it effectively excludes certain classes from getting any of the valuable loot that drops in a zone.  I can really understand why a lot of people get fed up with it.<br>
<br>
The original post (as translated by Sana) expresses frustration with the fact that there is often little loot for shamans under NBG.  The same is true for clerics and all other caster classes.  Even though I play a cleric, I still support NBG.<br>
<br>
If you're a caster you just have to accept the fact that you're going to get screwed over by NBG more often than not.  And there's a good reason for that.  Melee classes are much more dependent on equipment than caster classes, and there are a lot more different types of equipment for melee classes.  In many zones, the most valuable and sought-after equipment is for the melee classes.<br>
<br>
In many ways, the most important part of playing a melee class is the acquisition of equipment.  When the fight actually starts, the meleer presses an Assist hotkey, hits the auto-attack button if necessary, and presses the hotkeys for Taunt, Kick, etc. when they pop up.  Yeah, there's more to playing a tank than that, but not a whole lot.  For the most part, the equipment does the work.  A tank can actually go AFK during the middle of most fights, and no one will even notice.<br>
<br>
By contrast, the caster classes are all about spells.  For the most part, the difference between a good cleric/enchanter/shaman/wizard/etc. and a bad one is the player's ability to choose the right spells, to make good decisions on when to cast the spells, to control aggro caused by the spells, and to manage mana.  The equipment helps in many ways, but the player does the real work.<br>
<br>
A good way of putting this into perspective is CRs.  Suppose that my whole party gets wiped out in a dungeon, and we're all at the zone in trying to decide what to do.  Even naked, I'm functional as a cleric, though my mana pool is smaller than usual.  The same is true for the shaman and the enchanter.  The tanks, however, are in a world of hurt.  They are highly dependent on their armor, weapons, and haste items.<br>
<br>
This is why I still follow NBG even though I get screwed around by it more often than not.  Yes, the melee classes will usually benefit from NBG at the expense of the caster classes.  But the melee classes are all about equipment, and in my view they deserve a break on loot items that they will actually use.<br>
<br>
I don't favor the &quot;trade in your old item&quot; requirement, but this comment caught my attention anyway:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So if someone won a quest breastplate from Kael arena, they would have to give the group they were with their Trakanon breastplate because the quest breastplate is better? Sorry, this isn't right. If the people in the group weren't there to help you get the item you were using before you got this new upgrade, then why should they be entitled to it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When you talk about quest BPs, you're confusing the issue.  All of the quests that I know about involve multiple components, most of which can be used for quest armor for more than one class.  In all likelihood, your group didn't get you all of the quest components.<br>
<br>
Let's make it simpler.  You're in a pickup group in some zone, and an ultra-rare BP drops, which is superior to your Trakanon BP.  If you assert NBG, you are claiming absolute priority to the BP above and beyond all of the other members of the group.  What's so unreasonable a rule that requires you to trade your Trakanon BP to the group in exchange for being allowed absolute priority to the new BP?  True, the group didn't help you get your Trakanon BP, but they sure as hell helped you get the new, superior BP.  Yes, you'd prefer to give your Trakanon BP to a guildmate, but why would anyone in your current group care about your guild?  Why should you and your guildmate wind up with ultra-valuable BPs, while the rest of the people in your group get nothing?<br>
<br>
If your group imposes a &quot;trade in&quot; requirement, and you don't want to part with your Trakanon BP, then don't claim NBG.  Let the whole group roll on the item, and maybe you'll win it anyway.  If you want to receive absolute priority to an ultra-valuable item over the rest of your group, isn't it fair that you give something in exchange?<br>
<br>
Just the same, I don't advocate the use of a &quot;trade in&quot; requirement for NBG.  That sort of rule does not work well because of no-drop items and because loot whores will evade the rule by changing their equipment before going to a particular camp.  Also, you get the aggravation of dealing with selfish people who think NBG should be a free ride.  The rule is fair, but it just doesn't work well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukinbien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinbien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/01 9:08:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Ya almost got it right, the first 10 words sum up the entire problem. Just because someone can immediately equip said item does not give them automatic rights to the item, unless they acquired the item solo.  If it took more than one person to acquire the item... it should be randomed to all those that assisted in acquiring it, unless prior arrangements were made.<br>
<br>

I recently met a Pally that was still wearing all Ro armor at 55 thanks to &quot;NBG&quot;.  I'm sure that had he been able to roll on some other items, he'd have been able to purchase better items for himself.  <br>

This exact thing happened to me in KC.  <br>
<br>
We were having a blast in hand/warlord camp.  ES gaunts drop and I win (no druid).  A couple kills later Donal's drop.  NBG kicks in and I get gaunts.  Well I already won the ES earlier, so I give up the ES to gain exclusive rights to the Donal's.  <br>
<br>
Was I peeved to give up the ES?  Nope.  <br>
<br>
Would I have given up my sentry gaunts to get the Donal's?  I'm not sure.<br>

I don't care to much for NBG or FFA but I ensure I find out what loot rules are when joining a group.

I guess I had better strip naked and never loot anything in a pickup group again, since I eventually plan on replacing what I have now with pom/tov/velious quest gear. Ooh wait, I might not want to loot that either, you never know what the next expansion will bring.<br>
<br>
You should agree with a group how you are going to handle looting when you form up the group. If the group decides on something you don't agree with, or on something that will end up with you not getting any items, then you need to decide if the exp alone is worth being in the group for you. If not, form your own group or find a new one. Or go solo things for money.<br>

Maldaria  -   Either you are over dramatizing, or you didn't understand my post.  I am not saying you can't loot the item.  You would have the same chance of winning a drop as everyone else in the group.  If you win the random, you get to upgrade.  <br>
