<br>
Yesterday (9/25), he ran a &quot;rush pick up&quot; naggy raid after the patch.  I found out about this and was a little upset, because Gorndax had posted that he, Razzmataz, and myself, were going to run a raid for old times sake, and to have a little fun and meet some new people.  I told Golems that I was upset about this, because I had seen his name on this board under &quot;Dragons and Planes&quot; and figured he decided to race me to Naggy.  He told me that he had no knowledge of this raid and felt bad about it, so that I should come and bring whomever I had signed up along with me.  So Gorndax, myself, and our cleric buddy made our way to Sol B.  <br>
<br>
Turns out there was a major wipe out in the room before the FG throne room.  Reason being was that someone was pulling LDCs, and well....goofed.  Nothing got mezzed because there<br>
were no enchanters.  Then I heard after my rez from the wipeout that someone had ninja-ed the Warlord (not <br>
sure if this is true or not).  At this moment I probably should have just walked away, but no, I wanted to see<br>
if this was going to be successful or not.  <br>
<br>
We make it inside the throne room, and pull a variety of LDCs and FGs.  No one knows who the MA was, things got rather messy.  There were no set up groups for the FGs either.  We ended up having 2 clerics in our group and one shaman...meanwhile the other 8 warriors and few tanks had to share 2 clerics.  Our clerics ended up healing others..but I found it odd that we had 2 in our group.  <br>
<br>
Finally..we make it to the stairs before the buff room.  At this point I discovered that Golems had a monk named Jaky.  I thought &quot;Hmmm, where does this name sound familiar from?&quot;  Well I figured it out.  This was the same Jaky that was in EC asking if anyone had Naggy scheduled.  This Jaky got a reply from Oobidoob that there was, and I ooc'ed it as well.  Then I thought, &quot;Hmm, he lied to me about knowing..&quot;  <br>
<br>
Well, we finally got all the FGs cleared and proceeded to buffing.  In chat..it took forever for people to get there...our buffs were done horribly wrong, and things were not explained to everyone.  And those poor people on their first dragon raid had no idea what was going on... Basically, groups were set up no one knew what their role was and we were told this, &quot;Dararu pulls him to the door, everyone runs behind him, nuke at 60%&quot;  <br>
<br>
Well, we failed needless to say.  People were tired, because it was about 2am EST when this happened.  So I told people that I had a raid scheduled for tomorrow anyways, and that we should probably try again then when everyone is awake and has motivation.  Then Golems decided to go again.  (Well most of the raid left, but they did succeed at 5am EST I was told.)  Anyhow, when people were leaving, Golems had told the zone that there was an emergency patch that night and no one should worry because he would be up again tomorrow(which I thought was a lie from the beginning but I chose to believe him since it was late and I was tired).  Then others started saying that.  Lie number two of course.  <br>
<br>
Came into the game this morning asking if Naggy was up, he was not.  I talked to a guildie of his, they said the only reason he did that raid was so his twink monk could get the gloves.  Interesting...and there was rumor going on during the raid that these people who came along were being used.  I also heard from this person that Golems had neglected to attend or help out on a different raid (this part I am not so clear on).  Anyhow, I will not hold Golems lying actions against his guild for just this reason, that he seems to be separated from it.<br>
<br>
Golems, I suggest you apologize to those people you let down who signed up for my raid.  I suggest you apologize to me as well, for lying to me.  I can only hope that you let these people know that you used them for your own personal gain.  And I also hope that you can learn some respect.<br>

It makes me wonder whether there was someone behind the scenes who was eager to start a Ragefire camp.  It wouldn't be the first time that some questionable things have been done for that reason. That's just speculation, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umoltaenyadmagmus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moltaenya D Magmus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/01 11:11:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Disappointed</span><hr size=1> Yes I have heard that this isn't normal of him to do either.  I asked a few times about Ragefire during the night, and obviously he didn't need him since he had the epic.  I got no response as to who wanted it.  This morning when I logged in someone was at the druid rings in LS wondering if Rage was taken, I went into Sol B and checked things out and I didnt *see* anyone there...so no idea about that at all.  <br>

<br>
Your raid failed, admitted by yourself.<br>
<br>
You left the zone with Golems and others ready to take him down.  Whether or not you said you were coming back, is he supposed to leave it up?<br>
<br>
There wil be more Naggy's, this isn't like waking the Sleeper and nixing the warders forever.<br>
<br>
Whatever you think, you cannot reserve dragons, planes, mobs, dinner tables, etc on EMarr.  I direct you to this thread:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessage?topicID=233.topic">pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfr...=233.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Did it suck what Golems did?  Yeah, he knew you were coming back but took it anyway.  Is he to blame?  No.<br>
<br>
Suck it up, there will be more dragons come tomorrow and the next day and the next day...<br>

Golems rushed us, it happens.  Not everyone has the same respect standards.  I sure as hell never did that when I raided dragons, and i remember precisly a large discussion about a problem Crinkle caused trying to undermine Razzmataz's raid way back about 6 months ago.  Same thing happened to Adarian who took the day off of work to run a raid and was rushed by someone else.  <br>
<br>
If someone saw the boards which I know golems did as he posted a raid for the earlier patches, normally if you see something that might be a conflict you would inform them.  As that was the whole purpose of the board, and not for reserving them.  Foeb used to contact me if he wanted to do something like that, and it was polite and I never once said anything but GL to him.  <br>
<br>
He lied about the patch(tried to ensure us it was going in), he used people as cannonfodder to get a twink a dragon item, he lied to us not knowning about the raid.  Additionally, after the failed attempt I wouldnt have thought anything... except I invited him to ours later that day.  Instead of just packing bags after the resses and realizing that he could do it just as decent later he ignored our invites.  <br>
<br>
Greed gets the best of some I suppose.  I just remember when those raids were fun and exciting to take them down with tactics.  Im more upset for the fact that something like this has to pop up again and leaves the other 20 people out of a hope today.  <br>

No one's saying Moltaenya was &quot;reserving&quot; anything, but it's rather disrespecting just to butt in ahead of someone like that.  You've all read about it, and lots of people have agreed about it time and time again so there isn't really reason to say that's not disrespecting of Golems.  I've known Golems for quite a long time, and no that's not how I'd expect him to act.<br>

This is what happens at lemming runs. <br>
<br>
Honestly I am not suprised at this happening however I feel it necessary to point out a little detail.<br>
<br>
Golems little brother plays the same account sometimes and has been known to use his big brothers characters without permission. I know this as I helped him kill naggy and camp rage fire for his epic. Golems has never killed himself with a mana stone however his little brother has 3 times that I know of. Same character different players = multiple personalities. <br>
<br>
This is no excuse and I sure as hell do not approve of the lemming run that this turned into. Everyone should have left when they looked at how the groups were set up and the lack of needed classes. I think Gorndax showing up added credibility to the raid chances of succeeding and led people to believe they couldn’t fail with him present. <br>
<br>
AKA False confidence Example:<br>
<br>
I made the same mistake ONCE. I showed up to a lemming run said WTF are you people doing and stood back and watched with a afk message up that I am not leading I am not in the raid and if you think you will win your wrong. <br>
<br>
The leader led 40 people up the wrong ramps in vox's lair and wouldn’t listen to the people that knew what they were doing. The people that had never been on a dragon raid wouldn’t listen and some of the experienced dragon raiders even figured with the numbers they would be fine. <br>
<br>
People started asking me what was going on with the CR and I had to put up the afk message &quot; gravethumb got a res ported out and logged out &quot; if you want your body summoned bring 150 plat and get your ass back in zone.<br>
<br>
Spent 6 hours and a lot of plat covering the CR with Honir and found out half the people on the raid were personal invites from Gravethumb and were under level 45. Next week Gravethumb tried naggy. I stayed the hell away and had allot of fun without worrying about it. Wipeout and he did the same damn thing.<br>
<br>
The lesson here is if you think it is going to be bad LEAVE you have only yourself to blame if you stay and it goes bad.<br>

I'll be interested in hearing what Golems has to say about this.<br>
<br>
I wish people would show a bit more courtesy when it comes to conflicting raids, but this is nothing new.  The same thing has been happening for a long time with Hate and Fear, and it will probably start happening with VS and possibly the Kunark dragons before too much longer.  Sure, there's no reservation system on the server, and everything is &quot;first come, first served.&quot;  But most of us would like to see people be more considerate with respect to other people's plans. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udeeliinukrack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deeliin Ukrack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/01 2:29:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Disappointed</span><hr size=1> Some just take this game way to seriously. <br>

Naggy raid equals no caster lewt. I didnt have to be there.  I was there for fun.<br>
<br>
Any of you remember that word fun and not the words, What do i get out of this?<br>

<br>
Dont ever tell me im wrong again. Killing Naggy sooner gets the camp open sooner for those ragefire freaks. Letting Naggy stay longer is just pointless.<br>

From my dealings with him, he's always been decent and in fact, has helped a few raids out when they were in trouble.  <br>
<br>
Having said that, if he beat you to it, it's his right.  Granted, if he knew about it, it shows a complete lack of courtesy and he shouldn't expect it be shown to him on his future raids.  However, if he didn't know then you can't do too much about it.  First come, first serve and all that jazz.  <br>
<br>
How did someone come to the conclusion that he had a monk that was present anyway? <p>Tormentcia

BTW, we did NOT kill Naggy. This was my first Naggy raid. If I could have gated tho I would have...as soon as I found out we had no chanters, 2 clerics, and 1 shammy (Straif) who would be there for the actual Naggy run (Thanks Voom for all the buffs...***HUG***). At this point I don't think we had any Druids.<br>
<br>
My guildmate Straif and I ended up joining. Straif was told by a warrior, Dararu, that he would be in on the roll for a CoF if he joined (Straif is a 49 shammy...but his main is a monk). Later in the chatroom, Golems told me in private that he never did that. So there is one lie (don't know who's exactly).<br>
<br>
When I showed up I got summoned to the FG room. Everyone was milling about like cattle. No grps were made for Fgs...we just kind of formed our own. <br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, all loot was randomed..so that was atleast good. There seemed to be ALOT of downtime between FG pulls. I think about 3 hrs total until all FGs were dead. I know at one point there was atleast a 30 minute downtime as I had to recast Call of Sky 4 times (10 minute duration).<br>
<br>
I don't know what was up with the buffline. FR ended up being 3rd down. I'm pretty sure that is kind of important. I thought the crap buffs were supposed to go first? The buffline took twice as long as it should have for the amount of ppl that were there (my experience coming from working with Kerna's Vox raid last week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). I think because no crack and only one Necro to twitch. *sigh*. <br>
<br>
In the chatroom we were told that all the healers would be in one group to heal Dararu, who was the only one to taunt. O.K. I don't know if this is good strat or not as, like I said, this was my first Naggy raid. Took a long time for all to get in, too, because Golems recruited 2 druids for the zergling rush.<br>
<br>
So at about 5am PST we were all wiped out. I got no notice that corpses were being recovered..so I interrupted a druid and Nec in my guild from their game time to help out. Turns out not needed, but would have been nice to know something was being done. <br>
<br>
Well the CR ended up being a nightmare, for me and Straif. I got rezzed by Golems. As he was rezzing I sent him a tell that Straif had to log and I had his acct...so I needed to get a TP out of there so I could log on Straif for a rez. No answer. Rinse and repeat a few times. Finally I had to start saying it in /ooc. Finally just logged Straif on my husbands computer (hate having to run between two computers in a dangerous zone). Jaxxelia (sorry..forgot your name exactly) was kind enough to get me a TP out. During this time Golems had logged...4 or 5 ppl still needed a rez but had either camped or were afk...but Straif was ready to go. Found out later that Golems had rezzed Soulbring, our other cleric, and she gated. So no rez for Jaky...and he was pissed. Well, fine. Ended up having Voom pull Straifs corpse to the zone while I logged on Zendell, my husbands 52 Cleric, and ran him from NRO to Solb to rez Straif. In the meantime I sent about 12 tells to Jaky to consent Voom and I would rez him with Zen. No answer. After a small mishap for Voom (Did I mention you are my HERO??), I ended up Rezing both Voom and Straif..and Banisheol who was one of the corpses left behind by Golems (she got a summon from a Nec at the zone). One last tell to Jaky and Golems (logged apparently). 6am. time for bed.<br>
<br>
I don't know if all the corpses got found. Umbrae (nec in guild) offered to come do summons but Golems said he'd get everyone.<br>
<br>
It was definitely an..experience. So how does a good Naggy raid go? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Today I learned that in fact Nagafen wasn't on track in the morning, probably by some fluke, and last I heard Golems HAD taken down Naggy.  Unfortunately neither was the case.  Golems did appear to me and apologized for trying Naggy after he learned what happened and many other things, and I appreciate that. <br>
<br>
Things were set straight.  Naggy was brought down by my raid today, unfortunately Karma came back and bit *me* in the ass for the thread.  I had a freak LD, somehow went LD at the bottom of the stairs and yet I attacked Nagafen in his room and all....(where I got the killing blow, but he didn't poof.  I also poofed in his room).  I ended up logging in right at the end of stairs.  I missed my whole raid, but my raiders did well.<br>
<br>
This can show how much damage miscommunication can do, and while I *was* disappointed about the whole &quot;rush&quot;...like I said, he did apologize, and yes, he is of course the Golems everyone thought he was.<br>
<br>
We were both wrong, I'm glad it worked out.<br>

<br>
Anyhow FGs were cleared since RoD wanted to get Ragefire.<br>
We just had Magus and the two other wars plus nag.<br>
<br>
Cynsei did a GREAT job for first time pulling of FGs.  I was Main Assist - got Magus solo then the other two giants together.  <br>
<br>
Buffing went well and pretty quick. 4 crap buffs..haste hp AC resists rune.  People questioned why we did crap buffs and we told them.  Went to chat - loot got squared away groups did and strategy - basically we had an entire group be taunt.<br>
Basically he went down before I could call up Gorndax to tell him I went LD and it said my char was still active (it was weird...how did I attack naggy if i was standing still before the lag???????)  I was told there were like 3 deaths.<br>
<br>
Im proud of everyone there....no CoF dropped - I am welcoming everyone who joined me to join me again !<br>

<br>
anyway... I was pretty pissed that the raid was such a bomb... and then everyone kinda disappeared... no one answered questions... no one knew what the hell was going on after we "failed miserably" trying to kill the darn dragon... honestly... I dont see how that many people can fail... <br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
this was my 3rd naggy raid... the only one that went well was with Kerna... and it went PERFECT... I must say for someone who seemed to know so much about doing this... it sure didnt show it.<br>
<br>
and for all the porters and people who just scatted before everything was done... tisk tisk... I dunno why but when Im a part of a raid... win or lose... I tend to make sure everyone is taken care of before I leave... *shrug* (thank you to everyone who was very appreciative of me sticking around... glad to know I didnt do it for nothin)<br>
