UO isn't dead, they still have I believe over 100,000 subscribers.<br>
<br>
Help noobs how? Should we twink you, give you plat, hold your hand, what?<br>
<br>
Most people *are* nice to new people. I've given away almost *everything* that I or a guildmate or friend couldn't use to lower level people I didn't even know. I will almost always make myself available in tells to people who have questions about my class.<br>
<br>
I will not &quot;give me phat lewtz, items, plat PLZ&quot;. Fuck off. <br>
<br>
I will not respond to any abusive tells. I don't play this game to be customer service. Thx info -la la. I will gladly type out a more indepth reply then the person probably wanted, IF I am not in the middle of breaking a plane or otherwise preoccupied. However, I will usually suggest someone else they can ask if I cannot take the time.<br>
<br>
Every fucking person playing this game started out a newbie. We weren't magically given characters at our level. And for *many* of us, we started out not knowing SHIT about the game. When I started playing there were no maps, there were no item guides, there was no one to twink us. We worked weeks to get banded and a mino axe was phat lewt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
People 50+ don't fuck with noobs. We're not KSing their kills, or stealing their muffins for Christsake. The only time we generally see noobs is when we need to hit town to bank, get gems/food/etc or portal in on our way somewhere else. But realize that though MANY of us WILL go out of our way to help a new player, no one...I mean NO ONE is obligated to do a damn thing for a noob or any other player for that matter. Someone new to EQ has an incredible amount of resources available to them. There are maps, player guides, etc available online. Most people if asked politely will be considerate enough to answer questions. <br>
<br>
A majority of the problem comes when people want something and feel for some reason it's owed to them.<br>
<br>
BTW sounds like you played UO prior to Trammel coming out. What do you expect in a PVP game? Getting ganked by roving bands of 12 year olds is par for the course. Even still, it's amazing how many people there will also go out of their way to help someone new. <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

It can make for a shitty bunch of players when you get to higher levels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> BUT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are somethings that you can do for a newbie that does not contribute to making them crappy players thatdon't know how to do stuff.<br>
<br>
1) Free/low cost corpse locating.  If you are a bard, necro or SK and you can help someone find their corpse they will appreciate the heck out of it.  Not only that but you can pass on some advice like &quot;Stay close to the path&quot; or &quot;check out www.eqatlas.com for some good maps.&quot;  This helps.<br>
<br>
2) Sell them stuff instead of giving away.  If you get a bunch of Tizmak armor or finesteel weapons sell it to a newbie.  Make them sort of earn it.  You could sell it for the same price you would get if you sold it too a merchant and at the sametime equip a newbie with something that is an upgrade from that tarnished longsword they were using.<br>
<br>
3) Group with them.  Next time you play your twink form a group.  This is a chance for them to learn from you.  Teach them about pulling, working as a group, and hotkey making. Lead by example not by authority. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Don't play the &quot;I have a 50+ blah blah and that they should be happy to kiss your ass&quot; card. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Communicate with them, go slow and have some fun.  If they want to pull show them where to pull from.  And maybe it will be the lion and the mouse thing later where this newbie &quot;mouse&quot; may be there to gnaw through the net that ensnared your Lion-self.  Sure it might just be a TP or buff later down the road but hey you never know.<br>
<br>
Now, I still do not like beggar Newbies (especially the twinked ones).  The other day I had one in my face begging for buffs and such and I said &quot;Kneel before me you disgusting pile of escrement and may consider buffing your disgusting ass.&quot;  He kneeled. I never laughed so hard at someone else's stupidity and lack of self respect.<br>
<br>
But never the less, remember this proverb when you are deciding to help<br>

The truth is, we all hate the newbies that send us tells demanding our money, items, or time as if they had some right to them -- like there's a tax.  <br>
<br>
If that describes 100% of new players, then yes -- we hate newbies.  Passionately.<br>
<br>
I don't think it does.  I occasionally get courteous messages requesting information, or (very rarely) in-game assistance with something, and I have no problem at all with that.  I help when I can, and most of my old gear used to go to newer Rangers.  (Most of it's no-drop now.)  The problem seems to stem from the fact that real newbies are courteous to the point where they don't want to bother us with their questions -- which means that the vast majority of tells we get from new players are boorish and rude demands for free stuff.  That gives the rest of them a bad name, and the nice ones aren't vocal enough to correct that.<br>

I don't care if they leave.  I don't, really, sorry, I don't.  The newbie beggar scum that you've described are people that to be honest I really would PREFER left the game rather than making my life difficult by begging for level upon level.  By the time the number of players has dropped sufficiently for the game to be scrapped by Verant, I will have found something better to do with my time.  I have no intention or desire to play EQ for the rest of my life.  I'm not going to make newbie lives miserable but I really don't care.  If they leave for a new game there's a good chance I'm going to be playing that new game as well.  I managed to level my character up without help from anyone, they should be willing to as well.  Builds character, pun not intended.  /nod nod<br>
<br>
Now, do I care if some newbie who isn't a beggar needs my help and they're being nice about asking it?  Yes, actually, I do care.  I don't care about the pixels involved, but I do care that some person is out there on the other side of that level 5 mage distressed about the fact that their character just died in toxx when they're bound in GFay.  I care enough that if I'm not seriously busy (or even if I am seriously busy but they're really nice about asking) that I'll port them to Toxx, bind them if they want it, and help them find their corpse.  That's why, when I see a naked person looking bewildered and I'm not busy, I will ask them what's wrong and if they need help... especially if they're not begging in shout.  That's why I'll throw a sow at folks that I see running from zone to zone slower than they ought to and if I'm not busy ask if they need a ride... they had too much respect for the time of others to ask for one, in most cases... and if I have extra equipment I'm not going to give it to the beggar, I'm going to give it to whatever random newbie I pass by that can use it and isn't begging but is fighting valiantly with what he has.  Then I'm going to buff him.  That's why I'll wander by the docks on occassion and grab whatever people are there and port them to their destination when I'm bored, after all, I respect people who prefer to not impose upon others (I'm one.  My husband and I dislike imposing so much we made a L50 cleric to res our friends and guildmates and ourselves, so as not to impose), so I'm willing to make their lives easier.  I like helping people, I like taking care of people, but realistically I have to focus my efforts, and I choose to focus my efforts on my friends, guildmates, and people who I consider worth it, and that wouldn't be those people who think that the fact that my class CAN port them means that I MUST port them, or give them stuff, or buff them, or PL them, or anything.<br>

I agree with what a lot of you sed, including Owens. <br>
<br>
BTW, the fact that newbies beg; yes, I can't stand these scum. In fact, I've already made a macro I use in these situations. It's in say mode; and I quote &quot;I give nothing to waste of graphic engeneering beggars like yourself.&quot; <br>
<br>
However, what I hate SO MUCH MORE than beggars is, like Owens sed, high-lvl people who think too much of themselves. They think they're god-like, and if someone doesn't know something, they have a right to insult them. I have certain examples:<br>
<br>
once, some guy on a multi-server forum was bragging about how weak everyone was, and how he alone; a lvl 17 bard, killed Casic Thule. OK, I responded by telling him that you'd need to be at least lvl 46 to even be allowed to fight him. PLus, his theory was perposterous, and that you would need at least 4 groups of lvl 60 people to kill him.<br>
<br>
The next day, I get a response from a supposed lvl 55 character. His words; &quot;U fucking jackass, don't u know u need at least 40 ppl to kill this guy. Cant u do math faggot, get ur figures Right. Ur a fucking newbie, and newbies like u r fuckin morons.&quot; Tell me, is this not worse than begging? A beggar you just say no to. What do you say to things like this, they aren't very pleasant to read.<br>
<br>
Another example: I'm in EC, and i see someone selling an item I wanted to buy. Everyone usually sells this item for 100-190pp. I asked him how much he wanted for it. He responded by saying something like 300pp. I just tell him, &quot;um, don't mean to offend you, but isn't that a bit expensive? I see people selling it for around 150pp usually&quot;<br>
<br>
If he had resonded by saying even &quot;well, I bought it for this much, and I'll sel it for that much; this would be fine. However, he decides to say &quot;Look at my profile, I''m lvl 55 jackass. I know more about this game than u'll ever know. Look at u, ur lvl 15, ur a newbie; u don't know SHIT. Don't tell me about prices, I know all prices.&quot; <br>
<br>
THESE are the type of people that piss me off. What makes ANYONE of high-level think they are superior to anyone? The fact that they've spent months in front of a P.C, and now the little stick-figure of them on the screen looks cooler? That teh little number at the bottom; reffering to damage, and in 3 figures instead of 1 or 2? <br>
<br>
THIS makes you superior to anyone? I say, no, it doesn't. (btw, I've no conflicts with those who love the game, and do play it often, but DON'T act like jackasses because they have). These self-centered fucks are who piss me off the most. Not beggars (except a few; Binidin and company), not all NJ'ers or KS'ers (byars, others). But the high-lvls self-centered assholes are who piss me off. <br>
<br>
BTW, don't take this the wrong way; this isn't intended for high-level people who DON'T act like they're gods-ift to EQ. I'm cool with them; many are my friends, both in the game, and some in RL. But the select few... GRR. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubladecurser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bladecurser</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <b>Cyber Pimp</b><br> <font color=#000033>(5/7/01 3:47:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Does High level = God?</span><hr size=1> No we are not gods, but the stuff we can do can be amazing to them.  I say this because I have friends that just started playing and when I do some things they are simply amazed and entertained.  Sure, some of these things may seem pretty silly but they can be fun and make others go &quot;HOLY SHNIKEES!&quot;<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
A friend of mine that used to play Asheron's Call called his girlfriend to the computer so she could watch me do a bunch of illusions and emotes (/dance, /rude, /cheer, /wav).  He couldn't beleive the stuff he was seeing.<br>
<br>
I cast a couple dozen buffs (clarity, aug Rune3, etc..) on some friends that started playing a bit ago (they were under 10 at the time).  Later on I got tells from them asking what the heck was all that stuff because they were doing some crazy stuff that they didn't think was possible.<br>
<br>
One time a low level druid that I didn't know asked me for help in looking for his body.  To make a long story short it was in Erud's Crossing (and not on the island).  I used illusion: water elemental and a whole bunch of other buffs and things to search for his body under the water.  It may not seem like much to you and me but it was a god send to him.<br>
<br>
Relatively speaking, the abilities and combat skills we posses and the gear we have can seem almost godlike to the newbies.  Heck, there are times when I step back and think  &quot; Wilikers!  Can I do that?!??!?!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I remember one time encountering an iksar monk in Kurn's tower.  This was shortly after RoK came out.  A friend of mine and I were looking for various quest items.  Anyway, this Iksar monk and his pall claimed camp to the whole floor we were on.   Anyway, this monk proceeded to go on about how he had a level 50+ enchanter on this server and that everyone else was a newbie and should kiss his ass blah blah blah blah blah (remind you of anyone? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and he then decided that he and his friend should kill steal me and my friend(We weren't twinks like they were).  I then explained to this ignoramus how Verant's policy on Kill stealing and camping worked  and that I would petition about his behavior if he continued to do this.  With his tail between his legs he finally acted semi civil and started to listen to what I had to say.  <br>
<br>
Never underestimate the power of a Newbie.  Just because their collection of 1s and 0s can't number crunch they way you can doesn't mean that they lack in other areas <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uowens66.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Owens66</A></span><br> <b>l33t d00d!</b><br> <font color=#000033>(5/7/01 11:12:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I don't think you guys get the point</span><hr size=1> When people join an uber guild or get 50+ , some turn suprisingly snotty.<br>

Your not obligated to help anyone, but what is stopping you from trying?  Too busy, your playing a fucking game if you were busy you wouldn't be at your computer playing a fantasy role playing game.<br>
<br>
I hate beggers too, but I hate when people think they are funny when they totally go to town on a newbie who needs 3 more plat to get bind affinity.<br>
<br>
I was treated horribly when I started playing the game, and I didn't beg.  I didn't even have the concept of uber, all I had the concept of was gathering the cash for my next spell.  <br>

<br>
Newbies do make or break games.  ie....<br>
/ gets out his economics book<br>
<br>
1) New people stop joining Everquest or only stay for the free month, or go to an alternative.<br>
<br>
2) Sony, has 2 choices raises rates so they can make a profit, or cut costs to make a profit. (if they have no increase in the money coming in costs will eventually equal profit, meaning stocks will go down and a general loss for sony/verant)<br>
<br>
3) You now see shit like &quot;Would you pay an extra 10 dollars a month for better service&quot; Oh you mean the service that your supposed to be doing already, got ya.<br>
<br>
4) No expansions or sucky ones are made, if new people stop coming in, Sony has to keep the old ones addicted.<br>
<br>
5) Game will go to hell. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
