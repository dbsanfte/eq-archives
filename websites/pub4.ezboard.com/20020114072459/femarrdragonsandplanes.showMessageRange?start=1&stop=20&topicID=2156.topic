I've never bothered with this section of the board.  I don't get it personally.  I just can't bring myself to get so worked up to the point of calling ppl I don't even know names and insulting them because of items/mobs/etc. that exist merely as a series of ones and zeros on a computer thousands of miles away from me.  I don't even bother with that damned turtle, even though I am one map piece from my eyepatch.  A member of Midnight Sojourn once put it best to me &quot;Nothing on this server is a hate machine like Lodizal&quot;.  I get sick to my stomach seeing some of the things ppl say/do to each other because of an oversized turtle in a computer game.  Sure, I get frustrated like anyone else, but tossing flame grenades back and forth over the fence of the internet is not for me.  It is, after all, just a game?  Right?…<br>
<br>
Well tonight I experienced something that really made me throw my hands up in defeat.  It made me ask myself, “Why do even bother with this game, if stuff like this is gonna happen?”  <br>
<br>
Jump back to two days ago: I’m sitting in Western Wastes, watching the Scout Charisa spawn.  She eventually pops for me, I notify my guild, they promptly show up.  We turn in the toolbox, spawning the giants.  As we are doing this, I notice a naked level 1 (yes ONE) wood elf ranger named Tykinzrangah standing next to us in the tunnel.  I think nothing of it (was kinda busy atm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  I go out and snag the Captain, pull him to the tunnel and we kill him.  One of our rogues had won the pre-rolled random, and goes to collect his bracer.  However, Charisa is not at her spawn point.  Eventually our bard tracks her down, and our rogue is able to turn in the disk and get his bracer (grats Vuz!).  It turns out that Tykinzrangah (hmm, I wonder what his main’s name is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) had aggrod Charisa “accidentally”.  But words comes through /guildchat that he apologized.  Personally, I didn’t buy his story.  A level one naked ranger in Western Wastes serves one purpose and one purpose only; tracking nameds.  Obviously, at level one, you couldn’t possibly have good enough CoV faction to walk into WW.  Either the person behind Tykinzrangah was incredibly stupid, or he aggrod her on purpose.  Either way I don’t trust him.  But I let it go, after all, we got the Captain, and one of my guildies has a shiny new bracer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  No big deal.<br>
<br>
Jump forward to today.  I return to the Charisa spawn.  Not knowing what time she was killed that morning, I spend 6 hours sitting at her spawn point.  During that 6 hours, several people come and go, obviously checking the spawn.  One of those people was Tykin.  Interesting name.  Where have I seen that before?…Hmm…Oh well.  Charisa finally pops.  My guild arrives just before several members of Ring of Destiny.  I turn in my toolbox and a rogue kites the giants around so that the Captain can be separated from the rest and brought to the tunnel for the killing.  Once we are rdy, 3 separate /ooc's are broadcast to the zone saying to stay away from the tunnel area, because the Captain will soon be incoming.  Here is a screenshot of just one of those 3 /ooc's, notice that the person who took it did so after she had &quot;zoned&quot;, so to speak:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.afflictionguild.com/media/users/Gloriana/Inc.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I noticed that the members of RoD were still hanging around the tunnel area, and outside of it.  I approached them and tried just using good ol' /say.  &quot;Captain and other giants are coming guys, plz move&quot;.  This now makes 3 /oocs and one /say.  So 4 warnings have been given.  The rogue who had been kiting the giants sends me a /tell that the captain was a good enough distance from the others to pull off.  I run outside the tunnel, and what do I see?  The members of RoD fighting the Kromzek Captain.  I run up and try to get him off of them, which is difficult (which to me means, and I may be wrong, that they had built up a significant amount of aggro)and I die in the process.  <br>
<br>
So as I respawn at my bind point, I hear the guild say that they had the Captain solo.  &quot;GOOD!&quot;  I thought.  I begin speaking with one of RoD's officers named Aerich over /tell.  I ask him/her why they were standing near the tunnel when they were given 3 /ooc warning them to plz vacate, and I ask him/her if they were trying to KS us.  Aerich claims they were trained by us.  Over guildsay I see the ppl in WW say &quot;They trained us!&quot;  During the fight with the Captain, RoD had run all the giants they had managed to aggro to the Siren's Grotto zone, killing our party, save one or two ppl.  <br>
<br>
I continued talking with Aerich, and we managed to have a rather civil conversation about what was going on.  Word comes to us that Derit, guildleader of RoD and the cleric who had been in Western Wastes during the clusterf*ck, had survived, and had zoned to SG.  He was also refusing to rez our cleric, or any of us for that matter.  Also of note at this point is the fact that Chieling, one of the RoD monks, remained FD at the SG zone, with the giants standing a few feet away.  So the giants remained at the SG zone, and our shaman (sha-woman if you will <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) dies immediately as she tries to zone back over from SG.  I thought nothing of the fact that Chieling was FDd there, hell I would have been too if I had a ton of giants standing near me.  Then other things became clear.<br>
<br>
We finally get our ppl back to WW, and rezzes begin.  This took a few minutes because Derit was still refusing to come over and use his epic to rez any of us.  I guess a simple point and click was too much to ask, even for deaths that wouldnt have happened had they respectfully backed off a spawn they were beaten to.  When we are rezzed, we find that the Captain is nowhere to be found.  We learn that Storm's Fury, who had been nearby (in DN I believe), had killed the Captain.  SF did not know the details of what had just happened, and in no way am I pointing a finger at them.  Who wouldn't jump at the chance to kill the Captain if no one else was around?  So, I'm dissappointed, but I'm thinking &quot;/sigh, shit happens&quot;.  Then I learn that SF had allowed Chieling to loot the disk from the Captain.<br>
<br>
I shoot Yenom a /tell, and ask him if this is true.  He says &quot;yes&quot;.  Chieling had allowed Storm's Fury to believe that HE had turned in the toolbox.  SF had wanted to loot the disk for themselves, but had very kindly allowed Chieling to do so, believing that he was doing the quest.  I explain to him that I, in fact, had turned in the toolbox, and that Affliction had been doing the quest.  He apologizes for the mixup, and we talk some more.  I hold SF in NO WAY responsible for what happened here.  What they did, to me, was actually the right thing to do.  Unfortunately, it was done for the wrong person.<br>
<br>
While this discussion was going on, Tykin (boy his name keeps coming up doesn't it?) trains a velium hound on my party, who are still recovering from ressurections.  At this point I'm just dumbfounded.  RoD has refused to move from the area where we will be doing a quest, thus interfering with the Captain pull (whether that was intentional or not only RoD knows).  They train us while we are fighting the Captain, wiping almost our entire party.  Then, rather than show any kind of compromise or concern for the mess they have caused, their own guildleader (who I belive should be setting an example for the rest of them) refuses to rez ANY of us.  This is a mana free rez, mind you (epic equipped).  Then Chieling pulls his little magic trick, and manages to get himself a brand new Bracer of Benevolence.  Hey, and all he had to do was help get 8 Afflicties killed, mislead Storm's Fury, and have them do all of the work for him!  Congrats Chieling!  And then, just when I think RoD couldn't possibly show anymore blatant disregard and disrespect towards others, Tykin brings a velium hound to our newly rezzed camp.  This is the same Tykin, mind you, who's level one ranger (I don't have access to this guy's accout info, but I thinkt he name Tykinzrangah says it all) had, just the day before, &quot;accidentally&quot; aggrod Charisa while Affliction was doing the quest.<br>
<br>
Chieling, you had the chance to do the right thing man.  Affliction and SF did all the work for you, and you sit back and allow yourself to reap the benefits of their labor.   That's really, REALLY sad man.  And I don't want to put words into the mouths of some SF members, but I think you'll find that they agree.  Derit, I was really disappointed, to the point of disbelief, to learn that you wouldnt even take the time to rez our cleric.  Lynnwyth, the cleric that you refused to rez, is one of the sweetest, loveliest, and most respectful persons on the entire server.  She would have resurrected you in A HEARTBEAT.  Your guild could, and should, have respectfully left the area when you learned that we had beaten you to the spawn, and had even begun the quest.  RoD was warned on 4 occasions (more than that im certain, because of /tells and /say's from other of my guildmates) that the giants would soon be coming near the tunnel.  Anyone who knows anything about this quest knows that its usually done by pulling just the Captain, while the others are kept busy (usually by kiting).  But RoD remained there. I know that I, and other members of my guild, upon learning that a spawn/quest/camp is taken, promptly go elsewhere.  And if someone /shouts that a mob/quest npc is about to be pulled to a certain area, we would certainly have the respect to leave that area and not interfere.  But instead, I come out of the tunnel to pull the Captain, only to find them attacking him.  <br>
<br>
Ya know, I was disappointed that I lost the spawn.  I invested a good amount of time in watching that spawn.  But the other night, when another member of our guild was watching Charisa, and the Shriners beat us to the spawn and began the quest before we could get prepared, I was also disappointed.  The difference is that TTS beat us there fair and square.  They got the forces they needed, got there, and got down to business.  We were disappointed (especially our sha-woman, who had been watching Charisa), but we excepted defeat and we didnt interfere with their quest.  We got out of their way, and went about our business. <br>
<br>
What I was far more disappointed in was the way in which RoD treated myself and my friends.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

yes, both us and afflic where wanting the spawn, after soem grouping in SG, i leave and see that the scout is up, first come first serve, and i tell the guild taht the scout is up, and no bag in her hand, so we start getting peeps nearby (had a group in DN) to come, we also knew that afflic had a scout, but first to gather peeps gets it<br>
<br>
well we get there, and see that afflic is still cleircless. but then the giants are spawned, looked to us like they were &quot;buying time&quot;, but that is besides the point...after they train around for a little while i guess their cleirc got to the zone. but yes, afflic beat us.<br>
<br>
so we are already in the zone, and didnt see an afflic cleric, so we stayed around to see what happens. someoen called &quot;inc to tunnel&quot; so most people moved up and away from the tunnel on the hill...at which point the captain is brought right through us, and starts beating on us. i want to get this very clear, and what cyril said that we were fighting and had build up aggro is very WRONG. none of us EVER hit the captain. why he attacked us when near? dont konw, but he did. at one point as you guys were kiting them around in SG you got near me, and the same thing happened, i of course jsut FDed and let the mob go on about its business, however not everyone that was on the hill can FD. we had no itentions of KSing the captain from you, but didnt see a cleric, and were waiting to see what happens, if you failed at the quest or whatnot.<br>

[Wed Jul 18 22:29:47 2001] Gloriana says out of character, 'captain inc to tunnel, look OUT'<br>
[Wed Jul 18 22:29:59 2001] Cyril says out of character, 'plz clear the tunnel,  kromzek captain inc shortly'<br>
<br>
so we moved to up and away from the tunnel, over on the hill. you cant expect someone to vacate a zone, we thought we were out of the way<br>
<br>
at this point, i was still heading to the hill, trying to get out of the way. on the way there, the captain is brought nearby, and for no reason hits me...i FD, wait till hes back on whoever was kiting or whatever, and get back up and go to the hill<br>

[Wed Jul 18 22:34:28 2001] You say, 'fuck no.'<br>
<br>
we thought we were away....cant help it you are kiting these guys over a quarter of the zone =/. <br>
<br>
then about 30 secs later<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 18 22:35:02 2001] Berit tells the guild, 'zone into SG '<br>
<br>
b/c apparently nowhere in this zone is safe. so we zoned out<br>
<br>
now, as we are sitting in SG, afflic zones in. and THIS is why berit would not rez the cleric<br>
<br>
[Wed Jul 18 22:41:13 2001] Gremer says, 'Berit you can KISS OUR FUCKING COLLECTIVE ASSES YOU PRICK'<br>
<br>
followed by a lot of threats to train us and such, and name calling, not gonna post it unless you want me to. btw, gloriana was very nice throughout the chat, obviously trying to get things fixed. this was not an intentional train by any means. the mobs were brought right on top of us, 3 choices: die, fight it, or zone. we were not going to KS, so we zoned.<br>
<br>
check the time too on those, as you can see all this happened fairly quickly. most of those guildies came from DN i believe too.<br>
<br>
so short run: we both go to get the scout, afflic beats us, we think we are out of the way, captain is trained on us and start attacking us, we zone into SG.<br>
<br>
no attempts were made to KS or TRAIN in ANY MEANS.<br>
as for chie getting the BoB? youll have to talk to him...he told us SF killed it, then let him loot it. all i know about that.<br>
<br>
same with what cyril said about tykin and &quot;tykinsranjah&quot;...no idea who that could be...haha, but seroiusly, have to talk to them about that, i dont know..if he did anything intentionally, he never talked about in guildchat while i was online. <p>later<br>

At this time, what reason did you have to stay in the zone? Were you not, in fact, hanging around to see if Affliction failed so you could nab the Captain? If so, due to Murphy's law, you added a variable to the equation which led to the situation we have here. Had you originally zoned to SG, perhaps you would not have had giants run over you and/or possibly trained the rest of the giants on afflictions forces. But, for some reason, you chose to stay in the general area of the kite/pull. I personally would consider that annoying and disrespectful.<br>
<br>
As far as the Chieling thing, say it ain't so Chie. I never would have thought you would have knowingly let someone elses quest item be given to you, not in a million years. If you did mislead my guild into thinking that it was you that started the quest, then you really have changed. I can only hope that it was a mistake on your part, as an ac 18 bracer with stats is not worth ruining your friends opinions of you.<br>
<br>
Berit is a nice guy, always has been. If the statements were made as they were shown, then I can't see him at fault for refusing to res. If they were taken out of context, then maybe he has changed too =(.<br>
<br>
All in all, a really shitty incident that could have been avoided had one team decided to withdraw once the other initiated the quest. <p><br><br><br><center><a

Don't lay some lame jab out there insinuating that since they didn't have a druid and couldn't do it your way, they were unable to kill the captain. One good 60 group with a healer, enc/sham, and a couple of tanks can dust the captain like hes going out of style. The point is, the people who were hanging about to see what happened were no better than vultures.<br>

and just a hint, I know of one guild thats killed him sans druid before =P<br>

<br>
Actually, you can expect someone to vacate the zone when it’s Western Wastes. To do the Scout quests have to have Amiable or better faction with CoV, meaning there really isn’t shit in WW for you to do if you aren’t there for the scout. Only reason I could see for anyone to hang around is if they had ‘other’ intentions…<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>at this point, i was still heading to the hill, trying to get out of the way. on the way there, the captain is brought nearby, and for no reason hits me...i FD</font><br>
<br>
Up the hill because? Last time I checked, killing the Kromzek Captain wasn’t a spectator sport. Some people harmony, some people kite… I don’t think there is a right or wrong way, it’s whatever works for you.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>[Wed Jul 18 22:33:52 2001] You say, 'ya dont own the zone'<br>
[Wed Jul 18 22:33:59 2001] You say, 'go kite your mob elseweheres'</font><br>
<br>
If you stand there like a pillar on the train tracks, expect to get hit. When I do the scout we kite him around that entire flat area left of the zone, if you’re in the way then that’s your fault and not mine. If I saw you and a crew standing there for no apparent reason while I was kiting the Captain, then you told me I don’t own the zone and to go somewhere else, Id probably train your ass on purpose.<br>

This means (since mobilization through CS/SG sucks) that I lose her spawn to other guilds a lot.<br>
<br>
Just the other day, TS beat us there by minutes.  We were all pretty disappointed, but ya know, they had beat us there fair and square.  I wasn't quite happy enough for them to yell &quot;grats&quot; or anything, but I certainly didn't get in their way or interfere; you win some, you lose some.<br>
<br>
So, Charisa spawns last night and we had our group in SG but before Lynnwyth had joined us (she stopped in SS for something).  At this point, Affliction still had more people in the zone.  Gremer went off to fetch her and we buffed up a bit, discussed strategy (since we were without our usual kiters).  When Gremer and Lynnwyth hit SG and were a succor away, Cyril turned in his toolkit to initiate the quest.<br>
<br>
The following is what I saw/felt.  Assi was kiting and supposedly doing a pretty good job.  Lynnwyth zoned in and joined our group (Gremer was solo) so Aphro began to peel off the captain.  At that point in gusay one of our monks said, &quot;RoD is trying to steal the captain.&quot;  I was inside the tunnel so didn't see this, but in the heat of the moment, why would anyone make something like that up?  Aphro says she saw a RoD monk swing at our giants.  <br>
<br>
Cyril dies, but Aphro managed to get the Giant Captain into the tunnel and Lances engages.  Then Aphro dies.  So, the two monks are dead, Assi is still outside.  All of a sudden, Lynnwyth dies and I see all the other giants as well as RoD in the tunnel.  Berit is between me and the zone, I told our group to zone out and I jumped over Berit to get to the zone.<br>
<br>
Maybe they did train us by accident.  Sure, we only shouted/ooced at least twice (my screenshot of Cyril, Bruman's log of me warning them) to move away from the tunnel, that we were pulling to SG.  They were familiar with the quests, they were there to do it themselves!<br>
<br>
Berit did refuse to rez Lynnwyth when I begged him to so we could try again.  Gremer and Flagge did have some rather salty things to say, but from our point of view, they just trained us and killed our cleric.  (Note, I didn't ask him to rez everyone, just Lynnwyth who was bound in Thurg).  Scoppulus, the reason that Lynnwyth is speaking in gsay but is no longer in the group is because she had disbanded to get a port back with Gremer after Berit refused to rez her and I was dead in DL and had SCROLLED BACK UP to take a screenshot.<br>
<br>
I would like to believe that they trained us by accident.  I would like to believe that Berit was just too ticked to rez Lynnwyth, but the fact that Chieling got our quest piece just makes it too suspicious.<br>
<br>
They train, we die, they profit.<br>
<br>
I would like to say thanks to everyone I talked to in SF last night.  You guys have always been great.<br>
<br>
I really hate Scout Charisa, anybody up for killing Paeballa rats?  Don't give me any of that lame &quot;good rat&quot; crap!

first off cal, i was making that &quot;as a jab&quot; hehe, i was just sayin there are other ways of doing it. personally its how we do it, ya took it the wrong way ;-)<br>
<br>
and vendrix, im new to WW, just recentlly getting ally faction. just got done exploring all of SS hehe, yelinak was done, so i found myw ay to his lair =), im still new to WW, so i check it out. and we were up the hill, like i said before, b/c we WERE seeing what was happening. guys came in wihtout a cleric to our knowledge, if you had failed, we planned to pick up the pieces and gank him.<br>
<br>
were wernt a pillar in the train tracks. we thought we were out of the way. i was pissed that people have the audacity to lay &quot;claim&quot; to a large section of the zone, then be shocked when someone gets in the way. and i wouldnt tell you that you dont own the zone until after i had been trained/hit by mob you are kiting.<br>
<br>
&quot;then you told me I don’t own the zone and to go somewhere else, Id probably train your ass on purpose.&quot;<br>
<br>
btw, nice to see your natural reaction to things is &quot;you say something not nice to me? im gonan train j00!&quot;<br>
<br>
btw, check the time on the logs, it all happened fast. not like we had been milling around forever, we were both getting in people at the same time.<br>

<br>
It's a certain matter of respect.  When TS got the spawn before us the other day, we didn't wait to see if they would fail.  The giant captain isn't a hard fight! I've done it with 6 people before, I knew they weren't going to fail.<br>
<br>
As far as reserving parts of the zone, that's lame.  What about if we were pulling Gorenaire to the BW zone and warned people over and over?  Most folks GET OUT OF THE WAY.<br>
<br>
I think Celdor said it best.  If you had respected our attempt, you would have believed our warnings to move and you would have gotten out of the way.  You didn't, you caught aggro, you brought it where you knew we were, you got us killed and Cheiling got a shiny new bracer.<br>
<br>
Worked out well for you guys.  <br>
<br>
The reason I was so calm during our discussions was because I thought at the time the train was probably an accident (now I know it was because you were coldly waiting to see if we would fail and you were too &quot;new&quot; to WW to know you were sitting in the wrong place, despite warnings).<br>
<br>
I remained pretty calm in a &quot;well, these kinds of things happen,&quot; until I found out that Chieling profited from your training.  My opinion of you guys is pretty low.<br>
