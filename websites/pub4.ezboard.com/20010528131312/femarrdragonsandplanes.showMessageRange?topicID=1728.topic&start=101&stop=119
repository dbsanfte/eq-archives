<br>
IQ has nothing to do with knowledge.  Knowledge is fed to you and you memorise it (and half the time forget that you ever learnt it in the first place). <br>
<br>
If I go into a store (doesn't matter what type) and I ask the assistant/clerk/whatever where to find something I expect them to be able to help me, that they at least know the store layout and are able to say &quot;well suchandsuch is in that direction about 5 aisles over&quot;.  If they can't do that then I want an honest answer like either &quot;I only started working here this week, let me see if I can find it with you&quot; or &quot;I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to that, but let me see if I can find someone else to help&quot;<br>
<br>
Nobody expects you to have all read the classics, but to at least know that certain titles/authors are considered as such and aren't all Hollywood film remakes.  I guess what I'm seeing here is that people's general knowledge seems to be getting worse as well.<br>

So, if you took it that way, you yourself are either racist or too sensitive. If you want to look at it that way... I guess you could say my kids are half breeds as well. <br>
<br>
Never ever have I had someone point the racist finger at me. I don't care if you are white, black, blue, green, from the ghetto or uptown. Doesn't make any difference to us. (Yes, us.)<br>
<br>
Might as well hit this one and stroke up a new fire. Do I care if you're gay? Personally, no. In the armed forces, yes. Did I think less of of the guy I found that was gay because he was gay? Nope. But I sure as hell had to get him out of the area before he got killed by the others. Throwing someone that is gay into the mix with today's current views does nothing but cause havoc amoung the men. I got enough problems to deal with. So eliminating that one sure as hell makes the mission easier. Yeah, get pissed. <br>
<br>
More fuel to the fire: Women. (I can see them getting pissed already.) Got no problem with them in the military. However, what I do have a problem with is the ones that get carried and babysitted even when they can't meet the standard. Trust me, dudes get smacked when they can't perform at a level that is atleast double the standard. I shit you not. Double. Oh, and what type of injustice do you think this does the women that can perform the way men are expected? They get a bad wrap and lumped into &quot;that pile&quot; with the rest of the &quot;carried.&quot; All that to meet a quota. Which leads to the next subject you can flame me about...<br>
<br>
More fuel to add to the fire: I swear I am sick and freakin tired of my organization being the test bed for society's latest and greatest twisted ass political bullshit. That's not what we are for, and its getting old real fast. So if you happen to be a Senator and are reading this, please pass the word to knock it off. (Ever wonder if one of them or a Rep. played EQ? Yeah , I doubt it too.)<br>

<br>
What real &quot;action&quot; have I seen?<br>
<br>
I really don't really know how to address this one. For one, you'd probably think I was hyping myself up. Second, not even Mender, a very close friend of 7 years or so, knows exactly what I have done or not done. I've been in since 1989. A lot has happened since then. I guess you missed it all on the news. Off the top of my head... we've done about 17 or so engagements. 1 war (joke btw) and the rest were peace keeping, police action, rescue, etc types. People tend to ignore stuff that really does not effect them. News flash: not everything hits the news. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out. <br>
<br>
Since we are on the subject....<br>
Question for you - do you think it earns cool points if I  say I've been shot at, shelled, or had the vulcan death grip put on me? Errr... no. If that were the case, LA cops would have racked up more cool points than some rock group.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm rambling. <br>
<br>
Btw, its still amusing when you flame me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But I think I'll quit arguing the military stuff with you all now.  Until you lived it, you can't understand it and your opinion means very little. That includes all subjects btw, not just military. Although its funny to listen to someone talk about it that has no clue. Along with someone that has no clue who I am determining I'm not fit in their wonderous opinion. There are about 9000 people doing the job I do out of a population of... what?? 280 million? You figure out that percentage. I think someone would have caught on after 12 years if I kept putting my boots on the wrong feet or some shit. Step back and take a look at yourself buddy. Could you do it? My weak point is fucked up social skills, and I know it. Whats yours?<br>
<br>
I remember one dude commenting somewhere about Marines. He was in the Army I think. Get a clue. Like you know jack about jarheads cuz you were in the Army. Likewise, I don't know jack about Army mindset. And I don't even try to fake it.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah. If you work in a book store, and you don't know what the hell Hamlet is, you have been robbed, ok? No two ways around it. Its that simple. The book is in about every language there is, and its taught all over the world. (Not everywhere, I know.) There has been a multitude of movies made. Shakespeare is considered one of the greatest writers EVER. So stop defending peeps that are too fuckin lazy and short sited to pay attention. Oh yeah, you learned nothing from it that you can use today? You're not paying attention again. Humanity, thought, reason, decption, despair, etc etc etc etc etc etc. You're supposed to be able to take these tid bits and apply them to life. You think people are made to read this because the old English is a pain in the ass and they like to watch you struggle? /smacktheshitoutof you.<br>
<br>
So, did I piss some more people off? Cool. Wonder how long this post can get.<br>

This world is getting smaller and smaller, and what happens in Europe is of vital importance, whether or not it seems to immediatly impact your rather sheltered and peaceful life.  (I am refering primarily to U.S. citizens: we do live very sheltered lives.)<br>
<br>
Not only are we morally obligated to stop ethnic cleansing and protect those who cannot defend themselves (even if it doesn't immediatly impact your own life), but these conflicts can very easily spill over to neighboring groups and nations, quickly escalating into something much larger.  Just look what is happening in Macedonia now: this conflict could easily spill over to nearby NATO countries, at which point in time it would turn into a much larger conflict.  And what is Bush going to do about it?  Well, I'll let you figure that out for yourself, but based on his recent comments, made in the weeks just prior to this most recent outbreak of violance, I am not extremely confident that what should be done will be done.<br>
<br>
To this in the armed services, whichever branch: you have my highest respect and regard.<br>
<br>
As for old English: it is not really another language.  The vocabulary and structure may differ with modern English, but I wouldn't say it is that difficult to read.  It simply takes a closer and more careful reading.  And I think more people could read it if they simply tried.<br>
<br>
As for illiteracy: I don't seem to remember any specific statistics on this, but I don't think the U.S. illiteracy is really that bad.  People seem to enjoy getting pessimistic about the state of the U.S. educational system, which is actually much better than the media would like to say.  At any rate, graduation rates from high school is now much greater and higher than it ever was.  In the 1950s, I believe we had a graduation rate of around 50%.  I believe it is around 80% now.  Literacy rates would have changed with this number as well.<br>
<br>
However, I am not saying that illiteracy is not a horrible thing, and some people certainly do slip through the system; it must be a terrible thing not being able to read, as so much in daily life is so dependent on this one seemingly so simple act.<br>

Oh, very nice.  So succintly said, too, Shin.  <br>
<br>
But, for the record, Qool's original use of the word half-breed and the one being flamed is from his ORIGINAL (the very first one, Shin, if you weren't sure) post.<br>
<br>
Maybe my reading skills are lacking, but I didn't see mention of military in THAT post.  He threw that in later as a shield to hide behind, ie: Gosh, if I didn't use offensive language, none of my men (big burly men, cuz we know he doesn't have any homosexuals or women under him) would follow me or listen to me, *sob* *sob*<br>

<br>
I was not, will not and would not try to "fake it" when it comes to knowing what being a jarhead means. I do however know what it means to serve in the military. You have no more headaches than I did..believe me. You have no more dangerous mission than I did. <br>
<br>
You have been in the military for 12 years, well that still puts you behind what I've had to "sacrifice" for America's freedom. You have a ways to go yet but from what I *know* about marines you are typical material for them and should be able to retire given you don't get shot (even by your own men/women).<br>
<br>
Also, coming from a naval family I've learned Marine is not actually a military branch but an acronym. It stands for : My Ass Really Is Nave Equipment. <br>
