The Vietnamese weren't too keen on the US and Australia invading their pinko commie regime, so they got us back the best way they could. They arrived penniless and claimed refugee status. And most of them have a work ethic that make most Westerners look like fat slobs.<br>

Ever tried emigrating anywhere? <br>
<br>
Unless you're a Jew with a right of residence to Israel or a passport holder of a European Union nation, you're SoL.<br>

Emigrating is expensive, uncertain and downright fu<b></b>cking scary.<br>

<br>
In regards to companies gaining the right to search through our files, which in all actuality is an invasion of privacy...<br>
<br>
Companies suspect most/all of us(and most/all of us are guilty of this suspicion) that we are in possession of pirated files(mp3's, movies, etc). Through the use of programs such as napster, and now the p2p programs, we have brought this upon ourselves. Do you honestly thing a company(or band, or record label) which puts hard work into getting it's product out to the masses would NOT be trying to take legal action if they knew that millions of copies of their product were being copied and pirated--costing them millions of dollars--against those who do the copying and pirating(us)? <br>
<br>
I'm guilty myself, i download movies and mp3's(have several gig's of them alone on my HD). I fully understand why the companies are trying to gain a right to search through our files, although i don't agree with it. Likewise, they don't agree with the p2p programs, or our downloading their products against their will. <br>
<br>
It's a viscious cycle; we refuse to stop downloading files that are pirated, and from this, the companies will try any and every way they can in order to stop us. When you get angry over something like this, it is, for the most part, the same as when a thief steals something from lets say a 7-11, and then calls it an injustice when he is arrested for his crime.<br>
<br>
Just think abou that.<br>

I read the washington post, new york times, and my crappy chicago tribune.  When you read more than one newspaper, you realize how many topics are actually omitted and avoided by others.  I've yet to find a newspaper that covers both sides of the problems, and both sides of the solutions.  Most papers are either too conservative, or too liberal, that their focus becomes an attack on the other parties opinions, and not the actual subject.  The only newspaper that comes close to an unbiased account, is the wall street journal, but then again, its focus is not primarily on politics.  If anything, Foreign papers have the best articles.  They disect everything, and leave nothing on the bone.<br>
<br>
The problem with politics (and reports on them) in general is that they are not for the people anymore.  The majority of all bills, laws, and any other decisions made in local and/or federal governments are based on party politics.  This is because less than half of the voting population actually votes.  Without an overwhelming voice of concerned voters, politicians have become decadent, and are concerned more for thier party, than they are for their people.  Although this is not an absolute truth, it is very evident across the board.<br>
<br>
So like I said, if you are fed up with the entire thing, do something.  Go out and use your vote.  It is a valuble, yet underated power.  My hats are off to anyone who does excercise his right to vote. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utovectris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tovectris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/5/02 10:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3511.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ugh</span><hr size=1> There are crack whores kicking out children for more welfare money. I pay for that.<br>
<br>
There is a thing called Social Security that the government officials I had no part in putting in place tap into when they need spare change. I pay for that and will never see a dime of it.<br>
<br>
The government organizatoins have a policy that states that if the entire budget is not utilized future budgets will be trimmed. These organizations buy $100,000 hammers and conduct research on the speed of ketchup flow to maintain their fat budget. I pay for that.<br>
<br>
The congressional system says that if a particular type of legislation is not voted on it becomes immediately active. Every so often one of these pieces of legislation hits the floor that hikes their salary and builds in an additional bonus to them. On that day they argue semantics in non-party debate and take a long lunch. The next day they have more money. I pay their salaries.<br>
<br>
Oil became too popular and too easy to import. The oil companies wrote some large checks and our influence in the internation oil consortiums restricted the production of oil. The price went up. I paid them to raise the price on oil, even after they got large &quot;donations&quot; for doing so.<br>
<br>
Lobbyists used to be in place to argue points to sway votes. They are now nothing more than brokers. Your elected officials are paid for their votes, plain and simple. I pay them to ignore my opinions.<br>
<br>
Our government shells out billions annually to countries with no human infrastructure to allow for the proper spending of the funds. Rather than sending humans with a clue to assist, we send the money and wonder why they're still starving and pissed at us. I pay for that, even while watching out national debt go up.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
I hear a lot of people screaming &quot;we live in the most powerful country in the world&quot; daily. While this is quite true, this power cannot last much longer in its current state. Septmeber 11 showed Americans that we are, in fact, vulnerable to terrorism not only from our officials (who have been commiting fiscal terrorism for decades), but from anyone with a will to succeed. In typical idiot government fashion the immediate answer to fix all of the obvious holes. You and I are paying for what amounts to pretty much nothing. Any one of us could, with proper funding, load a school bus up with home-made explosives and drive it into a nursery school without the slightest hint of Law Enforcement interferance. This can happen at any minute of any day for any reason, and the most powerful country in the world can do absolutely nothing to stop it. Our elected officials are in office merely for the money, which sways their intelligence to the side of charismatic coaxing. When the @#%$ hits the fan they can deliver a nice speech on what they'll do to take care of it, but how many of us actually believe our elected government can accomplish much of anything?<br>
<br>
It's no laughing matter. History has shown many a culture at our very point sociologically and technologically in comparison to the rest of the world, and those cultures are now extinct. The rules are different, the methods are different, but the result is the same...<br>

Let me fill you in.<br>
<br>
Sweden - socialist nation. EQ has players from there.<br>
<br>
Netherlands - socialist nation - ditto, one of the admins is from there.<br>
<br>
Norway - country of origin of Anarchy Online, socialist nation, EQ has players from there<br>
<br>
Unired Kingdom - ditto re: socialist and ditto re: players.<br>
<br>
Most of the grouping and social aspects of EQ could be ascribed as socialist: i.e the combining of individual talent and skill to work toward a common purpose as a group.<br>
<br>
In other words Anikkin, get a clue.<br>
