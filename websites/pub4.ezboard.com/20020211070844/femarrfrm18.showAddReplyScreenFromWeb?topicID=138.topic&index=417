Hard to touch this one Triff, I mean now you're entering the realm of meaning in life.<br>
<br>
I'll just say - personally -that living for oneself i.e. indulging yourself and immersing yourself in every whim you have - it has no meaning.  <br>
<br>
It might be entertaining tho.... at least for awhile.  <br>
<br>
Then one day you look around and realize your life is missing something and that all the things you've been doing, well, they just aren't enough.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure that when I look back from my rocking chair at age 90 (or whenever), I'll count the relationships in my life as the most important thing, not what entertained me.  However, thats me.  <br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Don't you people ever become tired of catering to the will of others?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You misunderstand.  Serving others (in a religious sense) does not entail catering to the will of others.  Also, serving others outwardly while inwardly resenting it isn't really serving then is it?  <br>
<br>
No, I don't get tired of serving, I get downright pissed sometimes cause I'd rather sleep than go sing for the little kids at church cause my son was up all night screaming etc etc !!! <br>
<br>
BUT -  I do it anyways, and I have never regretted it.  A little prayer and I am back on track.<br>
<br>
I'm not any different from you just because I'm Christian, you know.  I'm still a normal person who makes mistakes.  I just have someone else to turn to, someone else to count on, someone who loves me perfectly, someone whose word gives me meaning and guidance....  and I can't ever mess it up and it was given to me freely and its a perfect love that shall never ever fail me.  It doesn't mean I always do the right thing or give selflessly all the time or let people beat me and my kid up... I react just like you would and just like Sally Brown next door.  I just have this added bonus to my life that I can choose to appropriate for myself.  I have a different focus in life is one way you could put it.  Christ - focused.  Whereas most people are self - focused.  hope that made sense to you. <br>

<br>
1. It is believed Jesus was not born in December. The bible references sheperds watching there flocks, but during December in that geographical area flocks are brought in from pasture. <br>
<br>
2. Easter was adopted from a pagan fertility right. Hence the use of rabbits and eggs and flowers. It was changed to the Celebration of the Resurection to refocus the pagan's bachanallians that were celebrations of life and fertility. <br>
<br>
3. Christianities biggest boost came from a political stroke. At the time Rome was trying to bring its empire closer together, and many religious disputes errupted between the various religious factions. The emperor said Rome would have but one religion. It became Christianity.<br>
<br>
4. The day of worship was changed to Sunday to appease the Sun worshippers. God is light and all. The sabbath was originally on a Saturday.<br>
<br>
5. The modern image of the devil, comes from pan. The Christians assumed he was the devil when described by his worshippers as it did not fit in with any of there versions of divinity. In the Bible when satan is anthropomorhalized it is usually as a serpent or dragon.<br>
<br>
6. King Arthur, if he existed, had nothing to do with the Holy Grail. Arthur was a hero amongst the pagans of the British Isles. Hence, the references to such things as wizardry and Avalon. Both concepts which do not jive with common accepted Christian doctrine. <br>
<br>
7. Even before Jesus arrived on the scene the jews were doing such things. For instance, ancient Israelites turned Babylonian and Philistine gods such as Bel and Dagon into demons in their own cosmology. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also in reference to wicca, <br>
There is a modern trend in current neopagan circles to reinterpret historical witchcraft into some sweet bloodless religion about female empowerment. In truth the anciet Greeks and Romans were terrified of the witches of Thessaly. <br>
-Neil Gaiman <br>
Upon research I discovered the witches of Thessaly derived their &quot;powers&quot; through the gnawing of the flesh of the dead. Human sacrifice was also attributed to them. It is not unheard of for people to offer animals or in some stories children to the witches to sacrifice to recieve the benefit of their magicks.<br>
<br>
This is just some lost bits on the pasts of religions that i thought may interest some. It was not meant to offend some, but as with anything which may go against an accepted belief it may. <br>
<br>
Take care all,<br>

<br>
 “I answered, Verily (quoth I) you tell truth, for I can finde no place in all the world which I like better than this, but I greatly feare the blind inevitable trenches of witches, for they say that the dead bodies are digged out of their graves, and the bones of them that are burnt be stollen away, and the toes and fingers of such as are slaine be cut off, and afflict and torment such as live. And the old Witches as soone as they heare of the death of any person, do forthwith goe and uncover the hearse and spoyle the corpse, to worke their inchantments.”<br>
<br>
For these Witches doe turn themselves into sundry kindes of beasts, whereby they deceive the eyes of all men, sometimes they are transformed into birds, sometimes into Dogs and Mice, and sometimes into flies. Moreover, they will charme the keepers of the corps asleepe, neither can it be declared what meanes and shifts these wicked women do use, to bring their purpose to passe: and the reward for such dangerous watching is no more than foure or sixe shillings.<br>
<br>
When this the good Gard of my body watched me diligently in the night, and that the wicked Witches and Enchantresses came into the chamber to spoyle mee of my limbes, and to bring such their purpose to passe did transforme themselves into the shape of beasts; and when as they could in no wise deceive or beguile his vigilant eyes, they cast him into so dead and sound a sleepe, that by their witchcraft he seemed without spirit or life<br>
<br>
Then the witch with her abhominable science, began to conjure and to make her Ceremonies, to turne the heart of the Baker to his wife, but all was in vaine, wherefore considering on the one side that she could not bring her purpose to passe, and on the other side the losse of her gaine, she ran hastily to the Baker, threatning to send an evill spirit to kill him, by meane of her conjuration<br>
<br>
I could go on and on and on…………………. For those who don’t know.<br>
<br>
These are all accounts written in the romantic works of Apuleius.<br>
<br>
The Golden Ass, also known by the alternative title, The Metamorphoses, is one of the greatest fantasies of the world. The latter name, The Metamorphoses, is found in the extant manuscripts, but Augustine, who studied some two centuries later at Madauros (as well as at Carthage), says that Apuleius called his work Asinus aureus or The Golden Ass, which name I shall use hereafter (the word 'golden' in this context denotes &quot;a quality of excellence and admirability&quot; rather than &quot;the sense of being fashioned from gold&quot;). Apuleius informs us that he is adapting a Greek story. This is supposed by many scholars to have been a story possibly by the Greek author Lucius of Patrae. This text is now lost, though Ëïõêéïò ç Ïíïò (Lucios or the Ass ) -- thought to be an abridgement of Lucius of Patrae's tale -- by Lucian, a Greek satirist and near-contemporary of Apuleius, still exists. However, the splendour of the Golden Ass is original to Apuleius, as Lucious or the Ass lacks all imagination and style; it is nothing but the story of an ass, not an image of human life like Apuleius's tale.<br>
The Golden Ass is simultaneously a blend of erotic adventure, romantic comedy, and religious fable, it is one of the truly seminal works of early European literature, with a distinctly Eastern flavouring and a very modern feel. There are very few works with the pleasurable impact of the Golden Ass. Apuleius's images retain their vitality from almost 2000 years ago, losing nothing of their colour and magic. Indeed, the promise of the closing words of the Prologue: Lector, intende: laetaberis - 'Lend me your ear, reader: you shall enjoy yourself' are amply fulfilled. Over the centuries, the Golden Ass has brought pleasure and inspiration to generations of readers and writers, from Shakespeare to Salman Rushdie. A copy of the Golden Ass was one of the few things T.E. Lawrence ('of Arabia') carried in his saddle-bags throughout the Arab Revolt. <br>
However, The Golden Ass is not a story about magic, the supernatural of the novel is a convience subordinate to the spinning of a story about man and the struggle of life in a world of limited resources. Magic in The Golden Ass may change a man too an ass, but it does not transform the Finite into the Infinite:-- it does not eliminate the 'need' for slaves, make all of the poor men rich or all the hungry satiated. Magic forms part of Apuleius's natural world:-- the world in which it is winter during those months in which Ceres's daughter dwells in Hades; a world in which the earth is not always bountious, not matter how much one propriates the Gods with burnt offerings and other sacrifices. Spells and witchcraft do not change these facts.    <br>
Part of the inherent struggle depicted in The Golden Ass is that of arises from man's own inner desires for pleasure. In this we find one of the 'Eastern' elements of Apuleius's work, the journey to escape from the bonds of desire endured by Lucius is similar to the Hindu concept of moksha (&quot;release&quot;), the Bhagavad-Gita dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna being an excellent expression of this philosophy. This is not to say that the Golden Ass is by any means a moralistic tale of a libertine who realises the 'ungodliness' of his ways and reforms in order to secure a seat in the heavens. Apuleius celebrates the sensual aspects of life and his vivacious descriptions of erotic scenes illustrate his possession of the 'cavalier-poet' virtue of living life to the fullest, both the pleasurable and the painful. Just as there is a Tantric school of Hinduism which does not strive to avoid the sensuous side of experience, Apuleius's is a tale of maturation and the attainment of the wisdom needed to survive one's desires.<br>
<br>
As well as being concerned with the conflicts arising from inside an individual, The Golden Ass always treats the conflicts which occur between individuals, or between an individual and a larger group of persons. It holds a mirror to Apuleius's society, being the earliest book (at least in the West) to show society as a whole.  Not only does it illustrates the heroes, senators and other magnates of Roman power, but also simple shepherds and rustic farmers, cooks and scullions, artesans, slaves and beggars, and the dacoits and thieves of the underworld. When Lucius, as an ass, is forced to work in a flour-mill, Apuleius's pitiless description of the conditions of the slaves toiling there--comparing the human and animal in a single breath--shows his keen observations of unacceptable conditions in the Empire and is a plea for reform<br>
He begins by stating that he is going to string together a number of light tales, but then at the end of the introduction he says 'It is a Grecian story I am about to begin' ('Fabulam Graecanicam incipimus '). Fabulam Graecanicam - a Grecian fable: singular, not plural. This obviously refers to the main story of Lucius's transformation adapted from a Greek fable; making the plot of the ass primary. One suspects that Apuleius delighted in this seeming discrepany--though the Golden Ass turns out to be both a single fable and a series of tales woven together (a bit like the Christian 'mystery of the trinity' in its unity/plurality contradictions). Apuleius's abjuration to the reader to lector - 'be attentive' is quite right: only the attentive reader will be able to resolve the intricate mysteries of the Golden Ass.  <br>

The witches of thessaly never existed or that they were exagerrated. <br>
<br>
Do you truly believe sacrificies of blood were never presented in the name of witchcraft. Would you believe that like all things poorly understood, some used the mere idea of performing magicks as barter, for one's benefit or one's enemies harm, for reasons of greed or power. Does anyone believe their religion has a storied past with negatives to it also or is everyone on the pure path and when someone does something offensive in our god's name we simply say they weren't ours. Historically, the witchcraft you now call your own was referred to as hedge magick. True witchcraft although not necessarily harmful realized life was a force and that force could be used for many things. In VounDoun they practice bone casting. In some it is entrail reading. There are many accounts of acts done in the name of Allah, Jehovah, Gaia, whoever the fuck you attribute the idea of purity and goodness too, of things we find today reprehensible. <br>
<br>
So my question is were early Christians who practiced a lot differently then they do today not real Christians? Were the early practioners of Magik not true witches because they don't fit our modern ideals? If that is the case can early white men not be real white men because I find slave owning reprehensible and do not wish to be associated with those people.<br>

<br>
I just think that we need to focus on the future and accept our past. I just don’t like people referring to the past and think that is how religion is today? Or take the few bad apples and ruin the entire bushel.  <br>
<br>
I think religion has changed (all religion) because of technology and we don’t need to read bones to check the weather or check entrails to see where to plant our crops these days. I could kill my dog and call it whatever I want religion is a beleif of Many and they are free to follow it!<br>
<br>
I get people all the time that bring up the statement you said in your last post and I say to them well you used to burn witches? And you slaughtered the Muslims to “bring Christianity” to them and you know what cracks me up they say “OH NO” there is know way they where Christians. Umm… sorry I think they called them a HOLY CRUSADE? <br>
<br>
I am not up for a debate I just don’t like when people bring up the past and think that is how we are today. I think it falls down to ignorance on both sides.  <br>
<br>
Yes the early whites had slaves (but I should not have to pay for that), yes the Christians burned witches but I don’t go knocking on the relatives of salam, yes the Christians “slaughtered” the Muslims during the holy crusades but that does not mean the Christian today has to pay for this slaughter. <br>

I guess at times I get defensive because its like being a square peg in a round society. Tell someone your are a witch and OMG you have just turned into SATAN.  I am sorry but I think that %50 of the Christian church is ignorant of the fact there was the divine WAY before their god and there will be the divine when there GOD ceases to exist.  The Egyptian gods where here for thousands and thousands of years the Christian god has been here for what? 2 or 3k so there is a lot of time left.<br>

Remember people above else we are HUMAN FIRST! I am not going to take your kid for my next holiday celebration.  Please don’t try and save me or convert me to a GOD I do not believe in. <br>

Do not fear what you do not understand!<br>
