Generally when I group... I try to split gems 1 per person then 6 to the cleric.<br>
<br>
And, Pullatross, using the wizard skin as an example is really lame. <br>
<br>
Wizard buffs are a personal choice and rarely decide the fate of a group.<br>
<br>
Cleric buffs routinely decide the fate of a group.<br>
<br>
Paladins RARELY buff in a group situation and if they do it's themselves or probably the main tank.<br>
<br>
The cleric generally, if he/she is any good, buffs everyone.<br>
<br>
Enchanter runes are situational and rarely used in groups.<br>
<br>
Clerics are the only class that routinely buff the entire group using their own money.<br>
<br>
Either split the good cash loot with them or supply them with a stack of peridots.<br>

I'm a Necro and I hate how clerics get ALL cash loot and gems!!!   Ok yes, we don't do as much for the group everybody says. But I have used up a stack of peridots in 5hours in a group in solb.  Also clerics are always getting donations for the resses they give. Where is all this money going?  So far I haven't been able to win anything in random, so I can't get money that way.  There is nothing that  I as a Necro can do for donations that will get me enough money to pay for these gems.  Not only do I need peridots for diamondskin then manaskin, I also need peridots for my pet.  Oh, and I need star rubies, which cost 70pp EACH for the 60 undead spell.  Oh, and 175pp per coffin right now.  Not to mention the gems that are almost impposible for Necros to get just to cast the last life tap spell.<br>
I think it is very unfair that clerics get all gems, and then all cash loot on raids.<br>
<br>
Oh, and for those of you that say necros aren't as useful to the group, just look at all the clerics asking for twitch on raids, or those tanks who bug the necro to get their pet, or if we're lucky enough to have those necro spells all come out from luclin....look at those....mob drains and group adds to attack, str, and sta.  <br>

I've had one lady chase me down and verbally harass me for not taking a donation of I think 100pp back in early Kunark days, and I think thats maybe one of two donations I've ever excepted in my entire time on EM.<br>
<br>
I dont ask right off for gems when I group.  I see how its being managed.  If no one offers me gems and I dont see symbol as a needed buff, I'll ask if I can cancel using it if I'm not going to be repaid for it since we arent stressed for it, some ppl say fine...some prefer I keep using it in which I do.<br>
<br>
Its so funny to now watch Necro's bitch about clerics getting gems because their final pet costs a Dot.  And if your using a full stack of Dots in 5 hours in a simple ass zone like OS, you really need to figure out how to control your pet or not use it.  I've seen good necro's keep a pet(or two) in so many bad situations its not even funny, if you cant keep a couple in such a minor atmosphere I feel sorry for you.  The necro's in my guild never complain about gems and yet they always manage to get by w/out using the gem costing spells, so obviously its possible to not use the spell consistently.  And for level 60, why are you buying large coffins for 175 when you can buy a small for like 80 and how often are you dying in places that require you to consistently summon your corpse?  If your on a guild raid its not often, hell most unlikely, that the guild is going to force the necro to cover coffin costs.  I've never seen or heard of a guild that has.  Manaskin is an option the wizard chooses to make if they want to use it.  I've never had a wizard in my group use it.  Though the few wizards I group with know I'll keep their asses alive, so they know they dont need to use it, however your using manaskin wont make or break a group, a few hundred hps will.  I cover my own costs.  I have and will undoubtedly keep doing.  My bank is constantly broke.  The only people that hear about my Dot costs are my guild who have to continually listen to me bitch about it.<br>
<br>
When I group and gems drop, I take what I need to cover costs, let the group have the rest.  I'm not greedy and making myself super rich isnt something that sets high on my desireability list, so I can live w/out the uber plat.  It boils down to the cleric individually, some are good about it, some arent.<br>

I don't symbol Eve cause well it just takes mana I would <br>
rather have to heal in the next 5 minutes. <br>
<br>
The main problem with this comes when not everyone carries <br>
peridots.  So one person in the group wants to suck up the <br>
cost for the whole group so they can have a chance at a <br>
random gem drop.  When I am in OS all the rare gems are <br>
randomed Eve gets the regular ones to cover the cost of <br>
dots.  On nights that we get lots of gems and I know the<br>
dots have been covered for that day. We then just random <br>
all the gems.<br>
<br>
Everyone would have to carry a personal supply of Peridots<br>
to make this work.  I just don't see that coming to pass <br>
in the future. Most people don't carry chr gear and have the <br>
faction fixed to up high enough so that peridots don't cost <br>
them an arm and a leg most clerics do we have too.  A stack<br>
costs about 230pp. <br>
<br>
We master loot and we split for between 30 and 50 pp after<br>
3 hours in OS. <br>
<br>
I keep everyone with symbol. Even Druids Even Bards.<br>
Bards make thier own agro even if they aren't mezzing. <br>
Bards also tend to die fast so I would rather have a couple<br>
more seconds to get my heal to them so I symbol bards.<br>
Druids are usually snaring which also can get the druid <br>
spanked.<br>
<br>
That said I do symbol in order of risk and as mana allows.<br>
Tanks, Pullers and Enchanter/Bard/Necro (Whatever we have<br>
as a mezzer) Get first symbols. Then casters/druids. After<br>
that depending on the danger of the camp I sometimes <br>
symbol myself.  <br>
<br>
I think the system is fair as my regular group tends to play.<br>
To me this just seems like someones reason to whine about <br>
loot. In dangerous zones you take risks and give a bit to <br>
cover the level of danger.  I couldn't afford to pay for the <br>
symbols on my own. If I didn't have the gems to cover the <br>
cost I wouldn't be able to symbol at all.  I am not getting <br>
rich quick on gem drops.<br>

It also requires common sense to a lesser degree.<br>
<br>
Case and point: OS group, bar chef, consisting of:<br>
58 sk<br>
55/56 pally<br>
53 monk<br>
60 chanter<br>
54 shaman<br>
51 cleric<br>
<br>
The cleric did NOT have remedy.  Therefore, he was overhealing with Superior, and his buffs really took alot of mana out of his pool.  As the shaman, I had to keep a close eye on the healing situation in the camp.<br>
<br>
In the 3 or 4 hours that we were moving down to, camping, and moving up from bar / chef, I witnessed the following:<br>
<br>
1.  The SK taking roughly 80% of the damage<br>
2.  The Enc taking roughly 10% of the damage<br>
3.  The Shaman taking roughly 10% of the damage<br>
<br>
The cleric, monk, and pally in total took between 0-10% of the damage.<br>
<br>
We were on a master loot system.  Before the trinket split (any cash gems and rings / necklaces) I asked the cleric what his peridot cost was.  In this case, the cleric (Supreem) refused to take cash off the top.  I tried insisting three or four times that he give me a total, but he refused.  Had he told me, I would have given him trinkets IN ADDITION to the normal split, but by taking his cost off the top it adjusts the group share accordingly.  <br>
<br>
Common sense dictates that if you aren't getting hit, you DON'T NEED SYMBOL.  Yet, the monk and pally both asked for symbol with less than an hour left in the hunt because they felt &quot;safer&quot; with it.  That affects the group bottom line as well.<br>
<br>
This isn't that tough.  How many costs are you dealing with?<br>
<br>
Peridots cost between 10-14pp<br>
Fire opals sell for around 45pp<br>
Star rubies sell for around 60pp<br>
Rubies sell for around 110pp<br>
Emerald rings sell for around 80pp<br>
Mythral amulets sell for around 110pp<br>
Sapphires sell for around 95pp<br>
Sapphire necklaces sell for around 160pp<br>
<br>
Worried about your charisma?  What shaman or enchanter wouldn't donate a CHA buff to the cleric to help him out?  None that I know and work with.<br>
<br>
Granted, we are turning a fun game into something accountants would rather play, but if you want to be absolutely fair, this is one of the ways you can do it.  The whole system falls apart if the master looter skims, or if the cleric inflates his peridot cost, or if people start complaining that their personal buffs cost components as well.  This is a GROUP situation, and if your buffs are helping out group members (rune DOES fall into this, manaskin does NOT), you should be reimbursed accordingly. <p>Tanuden <BR>

It NEVER used to be this way with people complaining about gems going to the Cleric.  It was common practice and very accepted.  When I played my Paladin and would Master Loot, if a gem dropped I diddn’t even think twice before handing it straight to the Cleric.  Now it seems that people can fly to 50 utilizing 6 zones, none of which have good coin, fine steel, or decent drops but where experience flys by at an insane rate.  People are entering the high level game earlier with less money and gear then in the days of old.<br>
<br>
Now that I am a Cleric, I understand why this is done.  OS is a strange zone in which gem drops are fairly common.  On a good night, a Cleric will get a profit.  However most of the other level 45 – 60 dungeons/zones do not drop cash loot in nearly the same quantity.  Over the past week I used up 800pp in Peridots in various places (Karnors Castle, Chardok and the Hole) AFTER taking into consideration the few cash drops that were defaulted to me.  On Sunday I went to OS and had an amazing group.  I walked out of there with 1.2k in cash loot and used about 300pp in Peridots.  If you look at that one group, I came out ahead by 900pp.  If you look at the week as a whole, I came out ahead 100pp (which is a bit less than the other group mates since I made sure that each one got at least 1 or 2 good cash loots).<br>
<br>
OS is gem heaven and many Clerics view it as a place to resupply their Peridot bags.  It’s one of the few zones that we can come out ahead in and help to balance all of the other zones where we lose big.  Most Clerics are not going in with malicious intent to screw people over; they’re simply trying to balance their losses.<br>
<br>
Personally I’m still trying to find a balance on gems/peridots.  When I start in OS or any tougher exp camp that we have to break ourselves, I will symbol everyone.  Once we are at the camp and have things under control, the following get a Symbol: Myself (for timing purposes and the fact that on a bad pull I can draw some nasty aggro), the Puller, the Main Tank, and the Enchanter.  After that if someone asks me for a Symbol, I’ll give it to you but you’re not a priority if mana is tight.  I am now keeping track of gem prices just to keep an idea as to where I’m at (I’m an Accountant alright?) in a given camp.  Ideally I want to come out ahead on cash loot while passing each member of the group a couple of gems.  One of the things I try to do is keep the first 3 gem drops and then pass out every other gem that drops after those 3 (3 gems drop and I keep, the 4th gem is randomed, the 5th is mine, the 6th is randomed etc).  It seems to be a good system where I cover my expenses and everyone else walks away with some gems.<br>
<br>
Now as to other classes that use Peridots for personal spells, to me that seems a personal choice.  If you are burning through dots for shielding spells, you are doing something wrong.  I understand totally that as a Wizard you will overburn every now and then but if you are constantly getting aggro and burning through your shield, you’re doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
For the Necro complaining about Coffin Costs, you do NOT have to absorb the cost yourself.  When I get into a situation where corpse summoning becomes necessary, you better believe I’m going to foot the bill to have my corpse returned to me.  There is no way I would ever ask a Necromancer to summon my Corpse without covering the cost of the Coffin and a bit extra for the mana/trouble.<br>
<br>
Also, I would advise everyone out there to put together a Charisma kit.  With my Charisma kit, I can hit 110 CHR and the whole kit cost me 100pp.  I have made that back many times over when using it to get the best prices on things.<br>

I was trying to propose a solution that is fair to everyone, and eliminate the arguments involved with splitting minor drops. I also tryed to point out that not everyone hunts in OS. I personally avoid that sesspool as much as possible, but in doing so have noticed that peridot costs are not so easilly recouped.<br>
<br>
I've been playing other charectors lately and have noticed that I can play for weeks at a time without having any out of pocket expense to play, except for the peridots that I've taken to carrying and handing to the clerics before asking for a symbol.<br>
<br>
There have been some well thought out reponses to this thread and I can see the point of view on most of them, but not being able to remember to bring food/water/arrows to a dungeon isn't a good excuse to me. Thats part of staying alive at the most rudimentary level.<br>
<br>
Want manaskin? Bring a peridot<br>
Want rune? Bring a peridot<br>
Want a 60 pet? Bring a peridot<br>
Want a symbol? Bring a peridot<br>
<br>
In doing this all loot (read not just OS gems) can be split fairly to all in the group without anyone feeling shortchanged or cheated.<br>
<br>
Its the fairest way I could come up with, or we can leave it as it stands which is what will probably happen anyways.  I'm open to any other ideas that may be better than the one I've proposed.<br>

<br>
the symbol benefits the GROUP and therefore the cost should be that of the group not that of the cleric or tank.  i think the trick is finding a good solution.  i like the comments of some clerics here that they will use their judgement to determine when to share the gems with group members.  you are right, some greedy clerics may abuse that.  so?  if you're looking for perfect solutions you've come to the wrong place.<br>

Also, I doubt people are going to pay more than the coffin is worth so I never actually make a profit becuase I have to get another coffin so yes I do have to absorb the cost of coffins.  <br>
And I don't know what other people think flying through levels is but it's taken me a over a year to get to 50.<br>
I don't think we should fight over who gets the gems, but we should all get an equal chance at the gems we NEED.  The only time I have ever asked to get or random between me and the cleric is if it's peridot, an emerald, or a star ruby.  Otherwise looting is whatever the group has set up.  I think they should get any other gems because they are buffing the tanks.  But it is not right that they should get everything regardless of who needs it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulanidormoonsinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanidor Moonsinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/30/01 11:48:23 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/tsatwood/stuff.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Clerics-Peridots and You (open discussion)</span><hr size=1> In my opinion, it is not the pick-up group's responsibility to ensure that I'm compensated for being down on cash and/or peridots from past groups.  If there's enough cash loot to cover my peridot expense for a particular group, then I split the rest with the group evenly (or as close as possible).  If the enchie has been runing, then I give him/her a good deal more than the others.  <br>
<br>
Usually I get caught up by doing a res or two here and there...I don't ask for donations, but I do accept them to help with these sort of expenses.  I have my epic, so I don't sweat the mana, and if I do get a donation, well...I end up doing Naltron or Marzin on the one who donated.  Am I broke most of the time?  Yep.  Do I care?  Nope.  Do I get pissed when I hear about a cleric who sits in OS Jail for 8 or 10 hours and keeps every single gem?  Goddamn right.  <br>
<br>
But to address the initial question...how are you gonna get players to bring peridots (yes, I carry pearls, batwings, and fishscales, too) when half of them forget to even bring food!  *grin*  Don't bring your peridots, folks, cuz more often than not, some well-meaning idiot will try to trade me a peridot in the middle of a fight when I need to see just how badly the enchie is getting bent over and reamed by a coupla froggies.  <br>

<br>
Don't Symbol the warrior.<br>
<br>
I'm a warrior, not a great one STA wise.  I always have plenty of HP.  Symbol is nice, but I'd say that now, 75 percent of the time I am healed by a Celestial healing, or whatever Heal over Time spell.  The extra HP don't make a big difference unless you are CHealing (For efficiency or whatever).  It's not as if a decent group should have mana problems, right?<br>
<br>
I think the Tank/Puller needs to be Symboled during the break-in and in some camps where pulling 3-4 mobs is a regular thing, but once a spawn is broken, there isn't much reason to keep symbol up.  At most will be 2 adds unless your puller is really pulling crazy.  Any tank worth his salt can tank 3 of anything a pickup group in Seb is doing for long enough for a Mez or a Cheal to go off.<br>
<br>
And stop buffing secondary tanks, and other classes that shouldn't get aggroed.  Symboling them just encourages sloppy play (including the wizard).  The cleric and ench need a symbol at all times, IMO that's about it.  Symbol the group on breakin and then just those 2.  Would save you guys a lot of Peridots.<br>
<br>
Oh, but still, go ahead and keep every gem.  I have no quibble with clerics getting those gems.  And if they make a small profit that day, fine.  I guarantee that cleric will be screwed over another day and need the money. <br>
<br>
And if there's a Shaman in the group, that Talisman Spell is Component-Free, a Stamina buff adds a few more hp, have your ranger/pally buff the others and that should be plenty of HP to stay alive in a Pickup situation.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cents<br>
