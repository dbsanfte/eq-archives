Rule 1: In the middle i sometimes say the price if i have space... If i'm auctioning 5 things or so i put it on a hotkey and just auction it without the price cause it doesn't fit and i don't price gouge... i once sold a pair of DWB's for 50pp i'll get to that in a later rule though.<br>
<br>
Rule 2: I agree that just bugs me!<br>
<br>
Rule 3:  I have no prob with WTB so i guess i disagree cause WTB and *BUYING* are just as easy to see<br>
<br>
Rule 4: Disagree i like running over to see bags o gear =) keeps me awake in those boring EC days!<br>
<br>
Rule 5:  I agree don't let people try your gear on<br>
<br>
Rule 6:  Trade back if they are unsatisfied =) Agree<br>
<br>
Rule 7:  O this is a big one that ticks me off... I did sell those DWB's for 50pp and he said &quot;they where for his brother&quot; and resells them for 500pp while i'm still in zone.  I ask him and he says he was selling his pair... well why didn't you just give your bro yours?  Instead of ripping me off the only reason i didn't give you hell is cause i hate EC and wanted to get  my @$$ outa there and i did whatever it took!  I just wish you woulda waited till i left ignorance (spelling? is bliss!)<br>
<br>
Rule 8: Don't scam (STRONGLY AGREE)<br>

<br>
I don't take advantage of people. I don't rip people off. I am a haggler. I am level 47, yet I have played since the near launch of this server. I have friends who have played half the time I have, and have reached 55+. Does this bother me? No. Dealing with people is the fun of this game, the interactiveness (if it's a word, hehe). Camping Uber_spawn_01 for Phat_lewt_00 is no fun. Lot's of skill involved there. I buy what I want, to me; THAT is the fun of this game. Have your fun, I'll have mine. 8)<br>

This only works when the &quot;Groups&quot; are not active in EC..<br>
I think everyone knows what i mean... atleast members from those groups knows what i mean..<br>
<br>
Its quite simple... I,m looking for item X and let the group know about it... When person Y is doing a PC on that item then one of the members is asking that person if he / she is selling or buying..<br>
In case of selling then a price check is simply way under the normal going price.<br>
In case that person is buying &quot;and the group have that item&quot; then i dont need to tell you all what happens...<br>
<br>
The same thing is going on with new items and spells...<br>
A example.... some drood was trying to sell me a 54 wizard familiar for 5000 plat.. while i knew that that spell is a common drop...geez ....&lt;censored&gt; <p><BR>Shinryuu,  Wizard of Clan Autumnwood.<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usuicidalsamuri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SuicidalSamuri</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.thejunkshop.net/images/schlabo/potd_na_160x120.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/25/01 7:19:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rules for Auctioning. . .</span><hr size=1> What bothers me is when...<br>
<br>
I say &quot;wts something&quot;, they say &quot;how much for something&quot; I say &quot;100pp&quot; they say &quot;NM&quot;<br>
<br>
The point selling is to ask higher than what you expect to get so that people reply to your post of &quot;100pp&quot; with &quot;i will pay 75pp&quot; for instance.<br>
<br>
Another thing that bothers me is the oposite, i say &quot;WTB somethign&quot; they say &quot;what you paying for soemthing&quot;  I say &quot;90124809pp&quot;  they say &quot;nm&quot;.<br>
<br>
Again the point is the same.  Offer less than you want to pay for an item.  And then all these people just say NM...<br>
<br>
If you want to sell or buy something come to an agreement don't just descide that they aren't worth dealing with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also when someone says &quot;how much you want&quot; and you say &quot;this much&quot; and they don't even reply that also bothers me.<br>
<br>
People gotta not be so lazy and just talk and descide don't give up before you even start. <p>Radon</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umrbodie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mr  Bodie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Porn Star</span><br>  Posts: 360<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/25/01 7:57:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ftp.fracker.com/bum.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rules for Auctioning. . .</span><hr size=1> Radon if you know how much you are willing to pay, or willing to sell an item for, then say it when you auction it, and you will never have that problem again.

one simple rule, dont ever sell to them.<br>
<br>
i HATE people who give insane offers (ie: 12k on a 30k item) only to BEG and BEG that &quot;this is all they can spend&quot;, so they will settle at ANY price lower then what you are asking, to them spending 29k is a win or they wont buy it at all. now what happens after someone buys this item from you for 29k?...they resell it for 30k right infront of your face. does that 1k of a difference make them feel like they have beat the damn game? ive had this happen more times then i would like , i remember people who have done that to me and i make it a point not to do trades with them in the future.<br>
<br>
if you spend any time in EC at all, you know the people who im talking about.<br>

<br>
a:Looking to get it under fair market value for resale or..<br>
<br>
b:Talking the price down so a friend can get it cheap(see a)<br>
<br>
For those that don't sell very often there can be an intimadation factor involved in selling goods.<br>
<br>
I personally respond to the N/M's with a question of sorts.<br>
Is my price way off base?<br>
Why? Seems like the stats are pretty good... and so on.<br>
<br>
I then learn a tad on what the market will bare, and adjust my auction accordingly.<br>
<br>
Just remember that some people only go to sell once in a great while and have no reasonable idea what to ask. For instance, I got a 14/28 -5ac whip 1hs procs snare the other day. I now the ratio is better than lamentation, but with the -5ac how far does that drive down the price? Are Lammy's still selling for 5-6k? I bought my last one at 7k 3 months ago.<br>
<br>
You see, I haven't the foggiest clue what to ask for it. SO this is where &quot;make me an offer&quot; comes into play. If I got an offer for 2k as an example I would probably take it. Would this person then turn around and sell it for 4k? <br>
<br>
How is the casual seller supposed to know these things other than doing a price check?
