As the youngest, everyone in the family adored him - perhaps he was just naturally charismatic. He decided to travel his own path, so he decided to become an enchanter, simply to be different. As soon as he started into the training though, he found he loved the abilities of enchanters, and the fun they can have. His elder brothers once tried to convince him to let them help him, but he smiled softly, gestured slightly and mesmerized them, allowing him to slip out and explore Norrath on his own.<br>
<br>
     Ryka and Kilia met in Enchanter school and slowly fell in love as they helped each other learn the arcane scrolls and practice on each other. Kilia never had to mesmerize Ryka for being too close, as he was a perfect gentleman. Ryka finished training first and went out into Greater Faydark to learn how to make the jewelry he wanted to give his love. After much hunting he could finally afford to do so, and learned to make the jewelry he wished for his love to wear. He sought her out and gave her the jewelry, including the last piece as he kneeled before her, an engagement ring. As she said yes, she smiled a wonderful, beautiful smile that filled him with total love and made him the happiest man in Norrath.  <br>

*-*-*-*-*<br>
     Jythn grew up in a loving family living an eventful life in Highpass Hold. Her father and mother, owned and ran a shop selling jewelry, apparel, fine ceramics, and other decorative but useful items.  A lucrative business, Jythn's family were never in want and had all the fine clothing and jewelry they could wear.<br>
<br>
     Life in Highpass was risky at best, but Jythn's family was fairly well protected. Their home was above their well fortified shop so that whenever the orc and gnoll raiding parties reached the shop, the children were safe inside as their parents defended the area.<br>
<br>
     Jythn's mother was half-elven and that elven blood aided her archery. Many an orc wished it had picked a different house to raid during the seconds it's lifeblood drained away.  As quarter-elven, Jythn also found she had high agility, but not enough innate skill to use her mother's bows well. Jythn's father was a keen shopkeeper, but no warrior.  He used various magic items the store carried to wreck area effect havoc on the raiders, allowing his wife to take them out in their confusion.<br>
<br>
   Jythn's elder brother would inherit the store and run it as well or better than their father.  He already had a way with customers and was almost as savvy as his father at haggling with wandering traders for their goods. Jythn knew that she would always be welcome at this house, but would need to find her own path in life.<br>
<br>
     One day a new trader named Ryka was showing his wares to her father and describing what they were for.  Interested in the cured silk armor for monks, she continued the conversation after her father and Ryka had come to an agreement for ongoing trade.  Curious as to the life of a monk, Jythn implored Ryka to tell her all of what he knew of the life.<br>
<br>
     She pictured herself decked out with the fine cured silk garments her father had just purchased and knew she was agile enough to succeed as a monk. Jythn explained her calling to her father, who smiled and handed her his best jewelry and a full suit of cured silk he had just bought. Ryka agreed to escort her to Freeport to train as a monk and happily sold her father more jewelry and cured silk pieces to refill his inventory.<br>
<br>
     On the journey to Freeport, Jythn was amazed at how the handsome high elf easily dealt with situations by turning them invisible or mezmerizing creatures.  At night she found he was a truly decent man who was true and devoted to his absent fiancee.  Jythn was almost disappointed that she wasn't under seige from male interest, but relaxed and enjoyed being safe with him.  She decided he was like her elder brother back home in many ways and told him so.<br>
<br>
     By the end of the journey to Freeport, Jythn and Ryka were great friends and he agreed to help her safely get experience for a while.  As he helped her with harder creatures, occassions arose where Jythn's fists actually aided Ryka kill creatures that gave him experience.  They became aware of how well their abilities complemented each other and became constant hunting companions.  Jythn would forever be a bit envious of the fair Kilia for her  mate, but felt sure that should she really wish for a mate, there would be plenty of good men for her.  Perhaps, she mused, one would come that she would punch and kick with less effort, perhaps even only a throw to the ground...<br>
