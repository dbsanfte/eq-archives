I am quite aware of what it entails to be a Christian. And in the 18 years I called myself such, I dont' ever recall hearing about the Old Testament no longer being relevant. I don't recall hearing that God stated that the old rules were out the window. And I certainly don't remember reading anything that said it was okay to do all the things I've mentioned in previous posts.<br>
<br>
I've stated it before, I do not hate Christians, nor do I hate Christianity. It is just not for me. It's apparently not for a LOT of people, but they are so lost in the bible-thumping and the fear of Hell that they are too afraid to open their eyes to see if there's something else out there.<br>
<br>
Another thing: while it is the modern Christian's belief that you should &quot;turn the other cheek,&quot; and move on should someone insult you or try to harm you, it is not mine. Should a man insult my religion to my face, he should be prepared to defend himself. <p><center>

Would you say that such a person had better be prepared to defend themselves?<br>
<br>
As for Old Covenant and New Covenant, I heard these referred to constantly through my religious education as a child, as well as found it an often-touched upon topic in my later studies as an adult.  Obviously others here have as well.  I'm sure there are some denominations in the 20,000+ protestant denominations out there that dont hold this view, but I'd guess they were a small minority, and I figured this was something just about all christians were familiar with.<br>
<br>
Just because you didn't hear of it doesn't make it bullshit, and it doesn't mean the Christians here just pulled it out of their ass to fool you with or something.  Perhaps it means you should have educated yourself about the Christian religion you grew up in a bit better.<br>
<br>
If you're really interested -- you might read the scriptures that concern the immediate time after Christ's death, the first acts of the apostles, the discussions they had with Paul on these matters after his conversion.  There were debates among even these very first Christians, and eventually it was agreed that the Good News, the promise of the Resurrection, the New Covenant replaced the old.  Remember Christ's references to losing sight of God because of the law... at one point, I dont have the actual chapter/verse handy, but he says the Sabbath is made for man, not man for the sabbath... He'd asked the apostles to do something, and they were shocked, as it was considered not keeping the sabbath holy; but Christ was emphasizing that holiness isn't in keeping all the minute rules that the pharisees loved.  So the thousand and one little laws that were set out in the Old Testament, Christ pretty much got rid of them.  Dont need em anymore.  The cross and resurrection are the end, the last deal.<br>
<br>
Just reread your post - to address something else you brought up, I dont think anyone here, or any reasonable Christian, would say its okay to sleep around (whether gay or straight), that its okay to commit adultery (whether gay or straight), that its ok and good to abuse drugs or alcohol, to cheat, or anything like that.  Will people who call themselves Christians do these things? Of course - they're human beings, and as such are sinners.  Just because they sin, it doesn't mean they aren't Christians.  Christians are supposed to try to follow Christ's example; when they fail to do so, they confess in their own way, they ask forgiveness, they try again.  We're all human beings, no matter what our religion, or lack thereof; therefore we're all going to be less than perfect, we'll always all have our flaws... Are we going to constantly be running around pointing fingers at people saying you're not fit to be called a Christian/American/member of the PTA/etc etc etc...<br>
<br>
Basically, none of us are perfect, including you - so why do you get to judge who is a Christian and who isn't?  If you are so interested in judging whether people are fit to call themselves members of a certain religion, then tell me, do you do the same towards those that follow your religion?  And how do they feel about this role you've set for yourself? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulanayalanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanaya Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 9:02:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=305>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> doh some other people posted ahead of me.. my post above was directed towards Tyral. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyralthekithless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyral the Kithless</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 9:23:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=307>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://secondrising.8m.com/images/smilies/iamwithstupid.gif height=46 width=41></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If this last paragraph is true, then what would you do if someone called a tenet of your religion bullshit, and said the majority of your religion's followers were...

If you could actually discuss my religion with any accuracy at all, then it would be possible for you to insult it in that way. Since you have no knowledge of even the basic beliefs of my faith, you could not. If you could, then we would have a discussion, because it would be more than just base ignorance. However, if you insulted with your only intention being to get a rise out of me, you will have succeeded. And you will receive the ass-kicking you asked for.<br>

They do something that most Christians would consider wrong, and they see no harm in doing it again. And again. And again.<br>
<br>
One major difference between my faith and the Christian one is the idea of forgiveness and redemption. The Christian faith preaches that it is not good works that will get you into Heaven, but instead being &quot;born again&quot; in Christ and accepting him as your saviour. Asking him forgiveness for your sins.<br>
<br>
My faith doesn't teach that. We don't believe that being forgiven is enough. You must work to erase the deed. Your life is measured through the good you have done.<br>
<br>
You cannot compare the two religions. They are incredibly different. There are very, very few common threads between the two...and those are even of a different color.<br>

The fact that you'd say because I don't go to church, and hope that the whole Heaven/Hell thing isn't as extreme as it's read to be, you presume to conclude I'm not following all the teachings of Christ.  You know nothing about me, what I believe in, or why I've made any of the decisions I have.  You just merely wish to pass judgement and tell me what I am, rather than let other people define themselves.  Another example why I said earlier that rationality and irrationality is just a matter of your opinion.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They called themselves Muslims, even though they were definitely not following the teachings of Allah.<br>

I don't think so. Cast aspersions on my character all you like, when I have curiousity about a subject, I educate myself on the matter as much as possible.

You try on different religions to &quot;make up your mind what you believe&quot;,  yet if anyone else would feel free to interpret their religion and stay within that religion, you tell them they have to choose between either not being able to interpret, or having to disassociate themselves with the church.
