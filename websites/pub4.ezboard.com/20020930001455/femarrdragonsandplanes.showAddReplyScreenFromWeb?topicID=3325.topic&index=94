So I know it DOES happen. I would rather be accused of ignoring a woman than<br>
for example being accused of making comments about her bust size.<br>
As far as I know, it isnt against the law to ignore a woman. At least not yet.<br>
<br>
I have seen a female supervisor maliciously fire a male employee for insubordination,<br>
and I had uncounsiously taken her side, until the employee produced copies of<br>
e-mail that she had sent him, that clearly showed that it was HER interest in HIM<br>
and his rejection of her advances that were the issue. He walked away with 50k<br>
in an out of court settlement and the company stupidly retained her.<br>
<br>
So dont tell me it doesnt happen. You may sell that line to the naive, but I am no longer one of those.<br>
<br>
Harassment is an easy charge to make. WAY too easy. I am sure it DOES happen<br>
and the guilty party should be slapped down without pity. But I am ALSO sure<br>
that at times it is totally groundless, and lies soley in the perception of the female.<br>

<br>
and i'm sure this will make me very unpopular with the anti-chiteng bandwagon, but females claiming harrassment is a serious issue in the workplace. at least in my industy. <br>
<br>
while i don't go as far as to bow my head and not even look at a female at work, i stay very clear of them. it's too easy for a girl on the defensive to misunderstand something you are saying and file a sexual harassment suit. when it comes to teh courtroom, is her vs you, and she always wins, and your branded for life.<br>
<br>
i work in a male dominated industry, and women are on teh defensive, for good reasons. i chose not to put myself in any situation where it could come back on me in a negative way.<br>
<br>
i know that prolly came off and being as complete paranoia and chiteng-like. but it's not the way it is, i jsut don't put myself in any kind of a situtation, where anything i can can be misunderstood. i've a very blunt person, and it's easy to misunderstand what i say. <p>--- <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52762 " STYLE="text-decoration: none">Ariakkas</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 928<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 9:56:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3325.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neebo</span><hr size=1> Not sure if your being rhetorical or not. No I have never conciously rejected any female. As I have grown older and re-hashed certain relationships I have come to realize that it is easily possible that I wanted OUT of a relationship and forced<br>
HER to make the decision. Thus preserving my fragile innocence. Such events<br>
were unconsious and thus I do not hold myself accountable in any way.<br>
<br>
Because of time and space restraints on the board, even if I had an inclination<br>
to be 'democratic' and give equal time to female concerns: There are two overiding<br>
problems with doing that. First, I know little of how 'other' men react with women.<br>
I am NOT foolish enough to consider myself as even close to baseline. Thus my comments would have little merit or validity. For example, I would NEVER have sex<br>
with a woman I didnt LOVE. Period.  I have known women that laugh at that attitude. They have told me to my face that such an attitude is what causes the pain. To me they are unfathomable. I cant get a grip on such ideation.<br>
To meet a guy in a bar and not even learn his name and have sex with him<br>
reduces my opinion of the female to the same emotional syntax as watching<br>
two cats mating in an alley. And there she shall remain.<br>
<br>
If some poster like Glori (we assume the poster is female) would like to enlighten<br>
us all with what the world is like from a FEMALE perspective, I would welcome it.<br>
I would LEARN from it. But they are all too lazy it appears, or not concerned enough.<br>
<br>
The second obstacle is simple space. People claim my posts are too long already.<br>

It doesn't matter really if you hid your actions from your conscious thoughts. I am aware of that sort of behavior, as I have a tendency toward the same thing, though I believe I am more aware of my actions when they occur, even if I can't always stop myself.<br>
<br>
  Your little comment about women finding one night stands in bars is part of the problem. Why do the women get no respect, but you don't mention the men? You don't have to go into details, but you obviously have your opinion on the behavior; is the woman's transgression greater or lesser or equal to the man's, in the situation mentioned?<br>
<br>
  Superficially, at least, you seem to have the pedestal mentality of women, and when they refuse to live by your ideals, you condemn them, or their behavior. You excuse them, yet you appear to hold them in contempt.<br>
<br>
  I would hope that years of marriage would give you somewhat greater insight into the female point of view. Flawed naturally, but not even a female can adequately sum up &quot;the single female pov&quot;, because as far as I can tell, there isn't one. Somehow you feel knowledgeable enough to judge women, but not enough to see their point of view?<br>
<br>
  I wonder why you consider the human race superior to the feline race, morally. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 929<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 10:44:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3325.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neebo/cats/and women</span><hr size=1> Neebo,<br>
<br>
I own two male cats, and let me tell you something. Cats are the single most sneaky con men on the planet. They will lie, they will cheat, they will steal, and they will coil their furry tails around themselves and look at you with those HUGE cheerio eyes and say 'mmrpl?' (who me? in cateese)<br>
<br>
I love my cats and I live in angst that I cant find a way to help them lose weight.<br>
I am killing them by indulging them and yet, I am helpless in their grasp. I have never seen an animal designed with such perfect efficiency for its role on this earth. And they have learned the ONE most important thing from mama cat that they absolutley need to know. How to look cute.<br>
<br>
Cats have no morals, none. They might treat you with affection but its enlightened<br>
self-intrest not morals. <br>
<br>
Now having said all that, do you not see why I might compare certain human<br>
behaviors to feline?<br>
<br>
I have repeatedly stated that I am NOT observant of human male behavior.<br>
I do NOT claim men are more moral. I simply state, they dont interest me.<br>
<br>
Women would have you believe that somehow you have no right to an opinion<br>
with regards to their behavior, but then turn around and judge YOU on YOUR behavior. I have no time for such sophistry. If they do not conform to my standards<br>
of behavior(which are not really that harsh and totally in line with most religions)<br>
I do judge them and quite harshly. Any creature that has the GAUL to evaluate me<br>
on the basis of income, has no right to complain when I get out my tote board.<br>

WOW.</span><hr size=1> <font color='yellow'>As for gazing at women, I dont define that as sexual behavior. From my point of view it is just as easily defined as art appreciation.
