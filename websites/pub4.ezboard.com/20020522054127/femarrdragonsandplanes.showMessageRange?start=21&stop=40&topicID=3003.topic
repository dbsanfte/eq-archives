<br>
And they were the aggressor, and we were allied to China. Who provoked whom, exactly? Thanks for making my points for me, though.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;IF it is an excuse that we incinerated 80k during a declared war,<br>
why isnt it an excuse for them doing somethng similar?&quot;<br>
<br>
Because they did it first? Welcome to cause and effect. It's the first step to embracing sanity. Japan's war crimes were inexcusable. They were ordered to surrender, and they refused. Truman had to decide whether to kill 100,000 of his own men, or expend a few pounds of fissionable material.<br>
<br>
He made the correct decision. If you disagree, then I pray to God and sonny Jesus that you never run for office...here or anywhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The answer is that it isnt an excuse for either. The USA does and will again<br>
make serious blunders.  Apparently you just cant take that admission.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I can take that admission. Unfortunately, I'm still waiting for you to make a case for our provocation of Japan. Which you haven't made yet, haiku boy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Think about My Lai wont you?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, let's finish what you started. You've stated that the US provoked Japan by freezing their assets. I've pointed out that such an action is perfectly legal, and in accord with expectations.<br>
<br>
In fact, the Swiss are paying heavily for their failure to do the same to Germany, last time I checked.<br>
<br>
Do you have ANYTHING that would back up your original assertion? Anything at all?<br>
<br>
No, I didn't think so. I don't know what you studied for 20 years, but it sure as hell wasn't history. Sounds more like the Self-Loathing Apologist's Guide to the Axis Powers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 502<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/10/02 5:12:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3003.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You're a regular disco inferno, homeslice.</span><hr size=1> Hmm lets see:<br>

That isnt the case. The reality is that you should be trying to defend<br>
the USA if what you claim you believe is true. I will not be manipulated<br>

I wish to. You refuse to answer MY questions hey man that is great.<br>
Dont expect me to answer YOURS.<br>

Bring me the Persian.</span><hr size=1> Well lets see, since 18xx when the USA commander PERRY <br>
FORCED his way into Tokyo bay and shelled Edo.<br>
<br>
Japan had the good sence to realize that unless it wished to be colonized<br>
(ie like say the Aztecs) they would HAVE to abandon their insular stance<br>
and adopt western methods. Under the Mikado they did just that. They did<br>
it well enough to beat Russia at its own game in 1905. However they<br>
were STILL essentially a medieval culture. The USA gave Japan alot<br>
of very favorable loans in those years on incredibly favorable terms,<br>
in return the USA was granted the lions share of the trade.<br>
However, even then the infant Japanese economy was exceptionaly<br>
vulnerable to USA policy. It was Roosevelt impling that the next loan might<br>
not come that got Japan to the 'peace' table and Roosevelt forced Japan<br>
to give back all that it had conquered except Korea.<br>
When the west realized that Japan had its own agenda, and that no amount<br>
of persuasion would get Japan to abandon its agenda, that is when the west<br>
started using the economic blackmail. First the treaties were not renewed<br>
and then new treaties were made that could only be interpeted as anti-japan.<br>
<br>
Being no better off than England for natural resources and not having any <br>
convenient client states to exploit, meant that Japan would be unable to<br>
compete, on any level. They simply didnt have the means.<br>
In combination with the great depression, Japan suffered a cruel unemployment<br>
that impoverished 65% of its citizens. The problem of course could not be<br>
addressed on the level that they were trying to address it.<br>
<br>
The loans that the USA had so willingly extended were presented with<br>
unusual firmness for payment. <br>
I do not intend to teach some type of abbreviated History here, so I will simply<br>
assert that Japan's economy was almost totally dependant on foreign capital.<br>
<br>
As a responce to the activities so chauvanisticly recounted by Kytherion,<br>
combined with abundant propaganda, the USA pulled the plug.<br>
The upper levels of the USA goverment were well aware it would force Japan<br>
to fight. Admiral King went on record publicly with exactly that prediction.<br>
Because Japan was NOT totally stupid they knew they could not possibly win<br>
a war with the USA they tried to mollify the USA. But because the USA sensibilities<br>
had been wounded by the past 10 years of events, The USA decided that they<br>
would insist on TOTAL compliance. It would either be 'THE USA WAY' or no way.<br>
<br>
Not one reasonable statesman expected that to happen. To pretend that<br>
you are totally in the right, and doing nothing 'illegal' (Kytherion's words)<br>
and to say things like 'they did it first' is a hopelessly parochial and<br>
chavanistic view of the actual events. No we didnt attack them by surprise,<br>
that is true. No we didnt bayonet thousands of Chinese(at least until 1950)<br>
But what we did do, is flip off a proud people, that WE had forced out of<br>
isolation, and onto the world stage. No one forced us to do that.<br>
There were any number of less drastic and more ameneable solutions.<br>
<br>
In the 1600's A man got tossed out of a four story window in Prague.<br>
He landed in a 'honey' wagon. Suffering nothing but the loss of dignity.<br>
Sadly that man was connected. It touched off the 30 years war,<br>
the most destructive conflict Europe has ever suffered, I include both<br>
world wars. Wars happen for many stupid reasons.<br>
<br>
I dont really think a 'reasonable' discussion can possibly exist on this topic<br>
because Kytherion cant seem to break out of that mindset.<br>
<br>
In the context of my ORIGINAL post, I asserted that the USA was simply no better.<br>
We werent. I would assert Kytherion that alot of the people that read this board<br>
are NOT USA citizens. They perforce will NOT agree with you that the USA<br>
is always right. NO they wont agree with me either, for any number of reasons.<br>
Your mindless flagwaving is appalling. I dont have to agree with you, the USA<br>
tolerates dissent. One of its good points. Tho the Rebublicans keep trying<br>
to curb it.<br>
<br>
Now I have done more than indulge you, in an effort that can only prove futile,<br>
since you dont WANT to agree.<br>
<br>
No retort on the value of human life (ie 80,000 people) with 5.6 kilograms<br>
of U-235.  <br>
<br>
How about the USA being willing to see the world destroyed rather than lose<br>
its way of life. I dont suppose you see anything at all wrong with that statement<br>
do you?<br>
<br>
Tell me something Kytherion, is it all Human life that is so cheap or is it just asian?<br>
Why is it that all your arguments cheapen human life?<br>
To me even ONE citizen of the state is a tragedy.  Eighty Thousand is a nightmare.<br>
Japan's people were starving. We had already won. All we had to do is wait.<br>
But we just HAD to show the world what our new toy could do.<br>
It worked, Stalin was very impressed.<br>

<br>
You're correct, I don't agree.<br>
<br>
Not loaning someone money isn't grounds for them to assault you. HINTING that you might not loan a country money is not grounds for a surprise attack.<br>
<br>
You have no causus belli. You're so desperate to blame America for everything that you're either:<br>
<br>
a) grossly misinterpreting historical fact,<br>
or<br>
b) just making shit up.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;No retort on the value of human life (ie 80,000 people) with 5.6 kilogram of U-235.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why retort to such a fucked up claim? I said that the surrender of Japan wasn't worth an additional 100,000 American lives. Twist it all you want, lunatic, I can always repost my original statement.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;How about the USA being willing to see the world destroyed rather than lose its way of life.&quot;<br>
<br>
How does this statement of opinion apply to your complete inability to provide causus belli? Dance, monkey.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me something Kytherion, is it all Human life that is so cheap or is it just asian?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ask the Asians. Pol Pot, Tojo, Mao...why don't you ask?<br>
<br>
The Asians have far, far more experience in diminishing the value of human life than I do. If we go by the Asian standards set by their actions in the 20th century, I'd say human life is very fucking cheap indeed. Amusingly, whenever America tries to convince these people that human life is worth something, filth such as you call us imperialist meddlers for trying. <br>
<br>
So, why don't you ask the Asians what the value of human life is? Chomsky suggested the same...the Southeast Asians responded by murdering everyone who wore eyeglasses or taught school...basically by slaughtering everyone like Chomsky.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why is it that all your arguments cheapen human life?&quot;<br>
<br>
Why is it that all of your arguments desperately avoid the fact that you can't back up your causus belli statement?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Japan's people were starving. We had already won. All we had to do is wait.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I know. Far more humane to starve them to the point of cannibalism, right?<br>
<br>
You fucking asshole. People like you, meaning well, have caused more pain and suffering than the dogs of war could ever dream.<br>
<br>
Oh no, not VIOLENCE. We can't have that. Better to starve them out. Better to dehumanize them to the point where they devour their own hands. Better to have civilians starve to the point of rioting, only to be bayonetted by their own military.<br>
<br>
What a humanitarian you are, Chiteng. Yes...why bomb 80,000 when you can starve millions to death?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
More dancing from you, I love it. So far you've cited freezing of assets and a reluctance to loan money as sufficient justification for Japan to attack the United States.<br>
<br>
Neither satisfy, but that won't stop you, my fevered pet. Dance some more for me. You could, of course, just admit that you were talking out of your ass when you claimed causus belli...but a jelly donut says you don't have the stones for it.<br>

That's a misquote. I've not suggested that being a member of any ethnic group categorizes someone for violent action. It's a pity that you can't win the argument without lying. But then I suppose it's my fault. I'm actually starting to feel bad for picking on you. It's like making fun of a retarded kid. It's like taunting Rainman about his Kmart underwear.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Your rationale for incinerating helpless people 'to save' them from becomming cannibals is beyond comprehension.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, but you volunteering to starve them out is understandable? You're just a screaming pussy who'd rather embargo an entire people into starvation rather than force surrender with one act of violence.<br>
<br>
You're the weak-hearted coward who will watch a dog die slowly after being hit by a car, rather than whacking it in the head with a shovel. You talk mercy, but offer nothing of the kind.<br>
<br>
May every human being on this earth be spared the mercy you would offer them. You'll call in the war dogs just in time for the jackals to feast. The world is rarely a better place for listening to opinions like yours, Chiteng. There's a whole lot of mass graves around to prove it...ask an American Hmong family to tell you the stories.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just to recap the actual argument:<br>
<br>
You claim that Imperial Nippon was justified in attacking the United States in that we:<br>
<br>
a) Froze their assets pending an inquiry into war crimes committed against our openly stated allies,<br>
b) Hinted that we might not loan them more money.<br>
<br>
It would be something if America played by your rules, nutcase. That'd be a hell of a thing. Dibs on the Caymans and Portugal.<br>
<br>
Dance, bitch. Because if that's what you think constitutes causus belli, shaking your ass is all you're good for.<br>
<br>
<br>
(You may now continue with your incoherent rambling regarding Vietnam, Dresden, atomic weapons, American evil, blockading people into starvation, how the Japanese have a right to attack anyone who doesn't loan them money, and vague accusations of racism based on my inability to excuse Japanese aggression.)<br>

The bomb accomplished nothing with regards to Japan surrendering.<br>

Hey fuckstick...the problem with these here text-based debates are that I can go back and read what you said. Keep it in mind. Not that the above quotes smell of apologist or anything.<br>

Because in Chiteng's world, if you loan a street urchin a dollar on Monday, and then refuse to loan him five dollars on Tuesday...you're a nasty man and you deserve to be assaulted. Especially if said urchin used that Monday dollar to buy a knife and mug someone. Because he NEEDED that money. Causus belli, right? Perfectly justified. Welcome to Chiteng's world. Shit falls upward around here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hell, one misquote deserves another...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello my name is Chiteng. Kytherion is a rascist because he won't agree with me that starving people into submission is humane. Japan was justified in attacking us, because they might not have been able to continue their conquest of Asia without our loans. Fifty years of loans wasn't enough, we had to give them more, and it wasn't fair of us to say no because they needed that money to keep people employed while they killed lots of people and enslaved Korean chicks. My name is Chiteng and I am not insane. It was America's fault that Japan attacked us, we should have given them what they demanded, even though they were evil. And then we should have just been honest and attacked them instead, because that would be humane too. The sky is brown and my cat talks to me, and I am sane. If you think America was right to bomb them you are a racist. Starving them was not rascist. I am not entirely insane. Don't devalue human life, it needs to be starved properly with my talking cat under the brown sky. Hi. Dad lets me drive slow on the driveway. Japan was evil but stopping their loans was wrong, we should have given them what they wanted and attacked them and I wish I was a Marine. Breaded chicken fingers are gud and I am not an apologist even though starving people is also gud and nuking them is bad too and they would have surrendered if we had kept begging them to do that just awhile longer. I'm going to go off on another unrelated tangent now to cover my own contradictions, AND STOP EMBARRASING ME YOU MEAN MAN. Hi. My name is Chiteng.&quot;<br>

Yes, toleration of dissent is indeed fortunate. How else would your various personalities be able to contradict each other at every turn? You're a walking advertisement for cognitive dissent.<br>

Yeah, I'm just a big rascist. I've *callously* pointed out that failing to give someone a loan isn't just cause for armed aggression. How very, very rascist of me. Did I hurt your feelings, pookie?

I admit I have not been posting on this forum for very long, but like others, I will post when I feel like saying something. In this case, I wonder and shake my head at Chiteng. I've met his kind before, they love to argue and mix things up for the sake of mixing. It doesn't matter what you say, what point you choose to defend - people like Chiteng will always be around to piss on the parade. As a young captain, I worked for a major we once called "Major Sunshine." No matter if the day was gorgeous, flowers were blooming on the hillside, everyone was fat, dumb, and happy, we each had a pretty young girl hanging all over us, he was always miserable. He was like Ziggy in the cartoons, always having a rain cloud follow him everywhere he went. You could make a positive observation about anything, and he could always find the tarnish on the cloud's silver lining.<br>
<br>
In watching Major Sunshine, it was obvious he was the epitome of the concept, "self-fulfilling prophecy." For him things were bad all of the time because he drew badness and darkness to him like a magnet pulling iron shavings. He never had any friends to speak of, he certainly wasn't enjoying life, and not a single person wanted to spend any more time near him than was absolutely necessary.<br>
<br>
So, I read Chiteng and his constant negativism and arguments and all I can do is pity the poor guy. Most of us come to EverQuest to enjoy the game, either the excitement of the challenge or the camaraderie of friends. He comes to try and make others as miserable as he is. I have no solution to offer except to simply shake your head when you see Chiteng post and say to yourself, "lol, there he goes again."<br>
<br>
BTW, his view of American history and his interpretation of political intent is crap. It won't hold up under the light of day and under serious scrutiny of even a half intelligent human being.<br>
<br>
To quote one of my favorite actors, Dennis Miller...<br>
<br>
That's my opinion, I could be wrong.<br>

By the way, probably the real turning point of WWII, was when the German Ambassador in Japan lamented that the Japanese were not going to assist the Germans in Russia because they are not consulted the invasion was ever going to take place.<br>

A communist spy forwarded that info to Stalin, who then shifted about 80% of the troops on the manchurian border toward Stalingrad, turning the tide of that battle, and thus the whole war.<br>
