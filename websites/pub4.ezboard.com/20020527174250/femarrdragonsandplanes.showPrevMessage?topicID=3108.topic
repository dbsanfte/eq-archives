said Harper, a former biology teacher. &quot;Very few people have a problem with seeing a rat go.&quot; <br><br>Harkins said he saw the dogs being fed to the snakes as something productive since they would have been destroyed otherwise. He is now trying to find them homes. <br><br>&quot;I see how many puppies go unwanted every week,&quot; Harkins said. &quot;I hate to see any life wasted.&quot; <br><br>Harper said there are campaigns afoot to have Patton fired but there were no violations and the issue was resolved without any puppies being harmed. <br><br>&quot;I think he does a good job for us,&quot; Harper said. &quot;This just happened to be a very sensitive issue.&quot; <br><br>Harper said he was told about Patton's plan for the puppies Wednesday morning by a school official who had received a complaint from a parent. <br><br>Harper said he asked Patton not to feed the puppies to the snakes and Patton immediately agreed. Harper said he saw a few students crying. <br><br>&quot;When you have soft, cuddly puppies ... there are people who get real concerned,&quot; he said. <br><br>Patton has been a teacher at the school for about five years and there has never been any serious problems with his teaching, Harper said. Patton did not immediately return a call for comment Friday. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1004<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/1/02 10:11:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3109.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dumb Fuckers Award Pt. 2</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;When you have soft, cuddly puppies ... there are people who get real concerned,&quot; he said.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>And there speaks the voice of hypocrisy.

My guess would be that he was demonstrating the unique way in which a constrictor eats and probably the snake method of unhingeing the lower jaw in order to swallow food larger than its mouth as well.  <br><br>I dont see anything wrong with this, perhaps make the viewing of it optional.  The student not wishing to view it could do a little research and write a small paper on the feeding habits of snakes.

Snakes got a bad rap. First of all the fish eating snakes in my opinion make horrible pets. The best are the rodent eaters, rat/corn snakes(domestic not exotic because many foriegn types are different species but have rat snake for name), king/milk snakes, and the large constrictors, but they need very dedicated care as they need to eat larger animals and need larger cages and usually have strict heating requirements. You can gut load mice (snakes get significant nurishment from stomach content of there prey) by reducing or eliminating its water and feeding it lots of moist food.<br><br>As for this case it comes down to this the puppies were on doggy death row and the snake would eat them. Is that less humane than the vet technique of killing them? As for the kids, they were high school students and like someone else pointed out high schools across the nation perform experiments on animals all the time. I think it is pretty stupid to shelter your kids from nature. In nature life begets life. The puppies would have died but the snake would have lived. Would you rather they were gassed, thrown in bags marked toxic and taken to the local incinerator? <br><br>I have often had well intentioned people come up to me and tell me about the cruelty of feeding mice or baby rats to my snake, yet none of them have ever wanted the mouse or rat themselves when offered. I am also a rat keeper. I think a rat is probably the best pet you can have, and mine have always been great with children. Unfortunately my soft heart and inability to ween out a litter left my with seven rats who within six months produced over 20 some more. I had to find a pet store willing to take my rats, who probably became python food or monitor snack. The point being untill rats or puppies become in short supply I wouldn't worry to much there are probably hundreds stray in our country for every one fed to a snake.<br><br>Ritt<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uglazier.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glazier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/2/02 5:02:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3109.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dumb Fuckers Award Pt. 2</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry, but I gotta have my say. It is a culture thing. I like dogs and cats; I also like beef, pork, lamb, fish and chicken. I have kept snakes, as has my eldest son. My family, as I was being raised, had pet Bobcats, Ocelots, monkeys, a skunk, an otter along with horses and chickens, ect. Hell, we even had a sheep for a while. When it came time for my snake to be fed, I went to the dept store and purchased a nice fat little hamster for my snakes dindin. He thrived on hamsters, and later, live chickens. I would no more feed a puppy or kitten to a live snake than jump off of the roof and fly. An Indian (Oh, excuse me, Native American) from our early days had no such compuctions. While they kept dogs, if times got lean, pop into the soup pot with it. (Kind of like a mobile food source.) Other cultures in this world consider a fat puppy to be a delicacy, and are consumed with great gusto.<br>There is no reason to be feeding live anything to snakes these days, because rats are grown, killed and frozen for snakefood. In fact, it is not a very good idea to feed live animals to snakes, because they can smell the human as he is feeding the snake, and will connect the human smell do dinnertime (human smell, live food, time to eat, you get the picture). Some people have learned this as their final mistake in life, when they were dealing with the larger snakes. I know that this is something of a ramble but my point is that A. There is a food chain: cows, pigs, chickens, fish and in some cultures, puppies, are at the bottom of it.<br>B. The teacher in question is an idiot, pure and simple. It was a long time ago, but when I was in Biology class in school, the frogs that we dicected(sp) were dead; nobody had to kill their frog. By the same token, no highschool student should have to watch a live puppy killed and eaten by a snake in a class. There is enough of that kind of crap on TV... If I have bored anyone, tough. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uelnotssadnes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elnots Sadnes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/2/02 10:55:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3109.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You know</span><hr size=1> What pisses me off is that in Middle School we never dissected anything, but my teachers promised me in high school we would dissect tons of stuff.. <br><br>Frogs included.
