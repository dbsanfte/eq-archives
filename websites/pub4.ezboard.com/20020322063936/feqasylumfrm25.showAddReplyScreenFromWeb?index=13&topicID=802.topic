To top things off you didn't even put me on the reserve, I was totally bumped off. I don't know how to view it really.

<br>
12. Do NOT bother the raid leader with non-essential crap.  If you have questions, ask your group leader and your group. If they cannot answer that, the group leader will forward that question to the raid leader. Go up the chain-of-command. Spamming the raid leader with useless crap wastes his time and distracts him from concentrating on the things at hand. The raid leader has ALOT to deal with. Bother him only with very important questions.<br>
<br>
13. If you must leave, let the raid leader know. I've been on a few raids where people just left without informing the raid leader. It's common courtesy to inform the raid leader of these things so he can make adjustments on groups. <br>
<br>
14. When you sign up for a raid, you have signed off your right to do things &quot;your way&quot;. You will abide and do what the raid leader tells you to do. A raid is not a committee decision deal.  If he tells you to run to your death. Do it. Good raid leaders do things for a reason. If you cannot abide giving up &quot;your rights&quot;, do not go to the raid. <br>
<br>
15. Signing up on a raid does not mean you automatically get you IN the raid.  Signing up is just that: signing up. You show your interest in the raid. It is up to the raid leader to decide on who goes and who doesn't. There are just some slots that get filled up very early on and some slots have to be reserved for specific classes that are needed for the raid to succeed. There are also semi-invite raids where seats are already reserved for certain people. Each raid is a bit a different. Another thing, I might want to add... if you are ACTUALLY PRESENT at the raid start up and there are no-shows, there is  a good chance that you can still get in even if you did not make the List. Take the time to be there and you might get lucky. <br>
<br>
16. Know the raid loot rules ahead of time. Each raid leader does loot a bit differently. If you cannot abide by the loot rules, don't go. Most loot is done in shout and in a quick fashion. If you are doing something else other than concentrating on the raid, you will miss it.  If you miss a call on loot roll because you were unattentive, too bad. Do NOT complain and whine. It's over and done with. If mistakes happen on the roll, tell the raid leader. Be a good sport about loot and the raid leader will remember that. <br>
<br>
17. No Drinking on raids. I've been on a couple of raids where people think its &quot;fun&quot; to drink and raid. Drinking just shows how seriously you take the raid: i.e. not very. That just shows disrespect to the raid and everyone there. I'm sorry if you drink on any of my raids, you're never going with me again.<br>
<br>
18.  Do not complain about how this particular raid is going DURING the raid. Shit happens on raids. Deal and continue with it. If you think you can lead a raid better, go run one. There are people made to be raid leaders and others are not. Until you have walked in their boots and done the things they have done, you have NO RIGHT to bitch, moan and whine about how things are going or done. Good raid leaders have paid their dues. They have earned their reputation by failing, trying again and doing it until they do it right. I have the greatest respect for these raid leaders. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps some.<br>

Only use the assist key to start an attack, and ONLY HIT IT *AFTER* assist has been called by the Main Assist.  If you see the assist called again, hit it AGAIN...  battles can shift, and non-mezzable critters can show up.  Reassisting, and waiting for the call to assist are VERY important to a smooth raid.<br>

<br>
I shout my rules out pre raid everytime. It's a short list.<br>
<br>
0. DO NOT FUGGIN MSG ME UNLESS YOU CAT IS SUPERGLUED TO YOU TELEVISION AND IT&quot;S HANGING FROM THE CEILING AND ABOUT TO LAND ON MY HOUSE!<br>
<br>
1. When you enter the Plane you will go LEFT &lt;----- Everyone knows which hand is left? It's the one you prolly don't use for self gratification!<br>
<br>
2. You will assist you WILL NOT assist untill I call ASSIST.<br>
<br>
3. Adjani is on speed/c2 you WILL MSG her for it NOT ooc shout ect.<br>
<br>
4. DO NOT shout for your mobs to be pulled.<br>
<br>
5. if you end up away from camp and get aggro DIE! Get loc and Die we will come get you and rez you.<br>
<br>
Then I add a few specific to where ever we are. Info on TT's GL's etc.<br>
<br>
No amount of rules postings are gonna help the mindless dinks that just won't listen. They will get a bad rep and eventually won't be brought on raids and will either quit or finally grow brains and listen. I'm fairly lucky in that I have a regular team I raid with and we can usually bail outta any situation a dink gets us into. I also have the advantage of hosting many an open raid and have a high tolerence for dinks and being able to work around them.  <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usthistor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sthis Tor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 6:33:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=802.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raid rules</span><hr size=1> Wow.. lots of rules heh.  I like to keep it simpler than that.  Just tell people to assist, no 1 or 2 piece loot rules, epic pieces go to those closest to finishing... yada yada heh.<br>
<br>
If someone is messing up I'll deal with them on a one to one basis.. if they can't get it right then they will be asked to leave.. simple as that.<br>
<br>
Rules confuse the issue IMO.  Just set things up as a raid leader so everyone is doing everything they normally do and make sure you have one experienced person in each group to answer questions as they arise.  The raid flows more naturally that way.<br>
<br>
I've run 6-7 hate raids each one better than the last and I've had fun as a raid leader on each and every one.  It seems like many leaders set themselves at an adversarial relationship to the players raiding with them.  <br>
<br>
The truth is that in a well organized hate raid, there is very little 1 person can do outside of the puller to cause a total disastor.  Usually if someone's doing something it's pretty obvious and you can take quick action to correct or remove the problem.<br>
<br>
One last thing heh.. what is it with all these enchanters that go apeshit if someone asks for a buff in ooc?  So what??  If they were proactive and had these people on a buff list it wouldn't be a problem anyway heh.  <br>

<br>
Trust me there's alot 1 person can do to totally screw a raid and they don't even need to think about doing so. I've done hate around 50 times and lead at least half of those fear is in the 30s. All of my planar raids were opens. I've seen 1 person totally blow an otherwise perfect break which is why i stick to 2 group breaks for Fear and Hate. When I start leading Hot Exit raids I will most likely do 2 group and coh the others in. Simply not walking were you're supposed to can screw a raid (Hot, Hole etc). After so many Open raids you learn that a raid can be screwed in ways that you couldn't even dream of. This is why Visions and other guilds prefers to raid solely in guild. You fuck up regularly with them and they'll kick you out see ya.<br>
<br>
Buffs in ooc/shout. Um no. I'll bitch and get you Tl'd off the raid long before my encs will on that. Why? I got enough going on that I don't wanna see that crap on my screen. You use ooc or shout it better be to tell me we got mobs aggroing behind us or some other emergency. Not because yur crack faded or you want a_stupid_mob_00 pulled. Buff lists? my encs have better things to do then care about who's got what buffs. I've raided with the 2 best (based on the last enc botb) Chanters on the server. I won't host a raid without one of them in my pull team and neither one of them uses a bufflist. They got much more important things to think about. In a group sure i'm sure they stay on buffs but in a raid it's not something they need to care about. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usthistor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sthis Tor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 8:06:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=802.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raid rules</span><hr size=1> Well...

If that's how raids will be planned I should just show up at the last minute before everyone sets up. Just my 2 cents. You post about all these rules and BS on how to be noble and stuff, Yet you deny people the respect of including them in something they said they will attend. <br>

&quot;5. Don't ever be left alive with no clerics camped out after a train. In cases like that, being selfish is the worst thing you can do. Sacrifice yourself to give the clerics a few more seconds to get out. If you do so you may even end up with some rather cool screenshots hehe. Got a few of those myself, being left all alone in PoH with clerics camped out and a few dozen corpses lying around... and of course those 5 clerics of innoruuk beating on my sorry ass.&quot;  - Ulaian<br>
<br>
I will never forget one occasion like this. A long long time ago, on a Mithril Web raid, where some disastrous train by freak killed every cleric but me, and as the last alive cleric, I was told to camp. During those 30 seconds the sheer number of bodies thrown between advancing mobs and my seated self, only to be cut down, was horrendous. It was both touching and chilling to see ... and through their efforts, I camped out, and the raid was rezzed from there.<br>
<br>
As the cleric, I did nothing but watch them fall, knowing I had to make it out. The melee AND casters with their bravery did everything. It probably saved a 1-2 hour CR (at least).<br>
<br>

Aw man, am I even going to get into this one?  What class are you Sthis?  Are you a buffing class?  Have you ever played a buffing class that has at least one buff that goes on every peep on a raid AND led the raid?  If not, I'm not even going to address that.<br>

When I host a raid, and I know there will be more signing up than there will be room for (unfortunately almost all of my raids have turned out that way), I explicitly state how I will choose peeps to go on the raid, and who will go on the waiting list.  That may or may not include when you signed up, BUT I will extend my raiders the courtesy of letting them know before the raid starts whether they are on the roster or not, by posting said roster for everyone to see.  You may not agree with how I choose who goes on my raids, but as long as that raid has MY NAME as the leader that's my decision and not yours, and any flaming of me for it will most likely land you on my no-raid-for-joo list.  I realize you are not talking about me as I've never even heard of you, but that's an answer to your question that I think many raid leaders would support. <p><center><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig7.gif" >
