Don't blame me if you couldn't figure that out.  You're not alone you know.  There are a lot of people on this board that, when questioned or confronted, they must insult their opponents intelligence, but all this does is detract from your argument, because, if your argument was strong, you wouldn't need try to make yourself look better by belittling your opponents.  They could stand on their own merits.  Of course, since you apparently don't live here and have to deal with the crime in our country, I don't give your arguments much merit anyway.  I read them, thought about them and dismissed them.  'Tis my right.  Deal with it.<br>

<br>
You have to understand that as far as policing goes we are two very very different societys more then on any other subject I would imagine.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you something, the argument about using the billy club ( Truncheon if you want to use it's proper name ) against a moving car is moot. The reason is this, drivers in England do not drive their cars at Police Officers. Raise your argument as much as you like but I'll tell you how this would have gone down in England.<br>
<br>
Suspect is pulled over on a routine inspection or due to just cause on behalf of the officers involved ( always 2 in an on duty police car ), and the guy makes a break for it. At this point the copper chopper is brought in equipped with infra-red and thermographic cameras. Cars controlled by a central office would move to intercept and they would wait by the side of a road they had forced the car to go down. When the suspect comes close they throw a stinger ( telescopic road obstacle with 8 inch spikes ) on the ground which punctures every tyre and deflates them instantly ( spikes are hollow ) and they retract it to allow the pursuing cars to follow. At this point the car becomes almost immovable and certainly uncontrollable. Cars surround the suspect and the officers get out and ask the person to get out of the car. They then arrest him. They don't lean in the window, the driver can not pull away, the driver does not pull a gun. He gets out calmly because he know's he's screwed.<br>
<br>
There are no cop killings here. People don't run officers over. We don't have drive by shootings, or gangland killings. Police officers don't chase suspects through residential areas or near schools. They let the chopper follow the car, and the cars follow at a reasonable distance. They then resume the chase at a later stage. If the dirver bolts out of the car, they can't hide due to thermographic cameras.<br>
<br>
We get to see Cops and Worlds Scariest Police Chaces and its a drama. Over here we have Police, Camera, Action and it's funny show with no violence.<br>
<br>
Lith, would you prefer your work went that way? What would be your answer if I told you I could take almost every single gun out of america and get rid of the criminal american way of thinking to shoot an officer or otherwise harming him/her. Now tell these people.<br>
<br>
So as much as people can talk about a way of doing things are you aware how it works in other countries?<br>
<br>
It's nearly too late for American society to go this way due to a perpetual circle. Because your criminals have guns your police officers must have them. Because everyone has guns there is a higher chance that someone, right or wrong will use one.<br>
<br>
Violent crime happens more often per human being over there then it does here so defend your past generations choice as you will but you'll never get other societys agreeing with you.<br>
<br>
Somewhere along the line American Society made a choice before any of us were born. They chose a way to defend their country and guns have always been a part of that system. Somewhere along the line the British made a better job or scaring people into thinking that once you get caught you go quietly and I don't know what that was. <br>
<br>
What you are left with now is a bunch of officers who I have a great respect for because it is a war they fight. They do the best they can and like all of us they occasionally screw up but generally they do a good job. As much as I respect them for that and would defend THEM in any argument it's easy to see that whoever made the decisions in the past forced them into a way of life they should not have to live. And you cannot defend that. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
I personally agree with most of your argument that guns getting involved in the American populace has caused a great deal of crime un-neccesary; however, I wouldn't go so far as to say all of your policeman are safe from peril.<br>

<br>
I know thats out of context but thats one of the funniest things I have ever read.  You do realize the US is not a little island where everyone is prety much the same.  We have people here where owning a gun is a way of life.  Not everyone can hop in their Jetta, run to the market real quick and pick up some food. This is a big country with lots of different types of people.   <br>
<br>
Hell, there are militias in the mountains who would <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> give up their right to bear arms without a fight.  I suppose if you killed everyone one of them and pried their firearms from their hands the US could be gun free, but I don't see that happening anytime soon (btw, I'm curious about how England came about to destroying all the guns in the country, I wonder if it would work here).<br>
<br>
I've known people who live in cities, not in any kind of militia (one was a preacher actually) that have used the quote &quot;You can take my gun by prying it from my cold dead hands&quot;  and honestly, I believed them.<br>
<br>
As with anything its easy to play armchair quarterback and say how something should be done, but if you don't live here, you don't know what it would take.  It's easy to say &quot;if America was gun free&quot; but can it really be done?  Hell, most drugs are highly illegal, but I still see/hear about dealers getting busted all the time, and I'm sure as soon as one is another one pops up.  Why would guns be any different?  There certainly would be a big demand for them.  <br>
<br>
Yes, I will agree that if there were no guns here, violent crimes would probably go down.  I will dissagree, however, that it would be nearly impossible to do so.<br>

I stated in the thread earlier exactly how much respect I have for any police officer. Perhaps the fault is mine since you have also apparently misunderstood my stance Cao.  <br>
<br>
ALL I've been saying is that since human beings are involved  situations will not be clearly defined, mistakes &amp; tragedys happen etc. (and please, please don't take that to mean that this particualar incident was a mistake by the cop, I'm speaking generally - as I have in all my later posts!). When guns HAVE to be part of the situation (and I'm not argueing that guns aren't neccessary over there, for whatever reason that may be) the consequences are that much more final.  <br>
<br>
Carathos' first post to this thread took quotes from one of my own and argued totally off the point i was making.  The pepper spray quote for example supposes that (assuming gun control exists and therefore the suspects WILL NOT LIKELY BE SO ARMED and that again because of that assumption the officer doesn't need to be so equipped himself) the officers' non-lethal training will be enough to control the situation, and that it is the fact that he is armed that makes the situation more explosive (as it clearly did). The only reason the pepper spray etc was mentioned is that i wanted to make it clear that I had taken in what Lith had said earlier and was confident that an american police officer has the training to  control a situation without recourse to his gun, it was basically a compliment!  <br>
<br>
It seems I didn't explain my view as well as i thought, hopefully I'm making myself and my opinion clearer now?<br>
<br>
Right at the beginning of this thread I mentioned that I expected to get flamed, given that my view would probably be considered contentious. I was happily surprised to have a reasonable discussion (into which a number of actual US police officers had their say without any flame fest!) until dear Carathos came late to the game.<br>
<br>
 I read Carathos post and - since to me it seemed he had totally ignored much of what I had previously said and seemed intent on slagging my view with no real understanding of what I actually meant - I did indeed get a little annoyed :/. <br>
I felt and still feel that throughout the course of this and in fact any discussion I enter, I take pains to avoid being too judgemental or unfair and to have that 'thrown in my face' was galling.<br>
<br>
If anyone besides Carathos feels I have been condescending towards them throughout the course of this thread then I apologise since that was assuredly not my intent. Unfortunately, I can't in all honesty say that an apology to Cara will be heartfelt, heh.<br>
<br>
Peace? <br>

<br>
Gahulo, you couldn't immediately turn it around of that I'm sure. I think the reason guns are not so prevalent over here in Britain has less to do with their availability and more to do with how they are percieved in our culture. <br>
<br>
Gun's have been heavily restricted from long before i was born, as we grow up here they are classified by society as 'bad'. A dangerous item to be used only for specific tasks etc. As such since very few criminals are totally immoral psychopaths, the use of a firearm is still percieved as 'a bit over the top'. Given that you guys have been brought up with them in general circulation and are thus more 'comfortable' with them, the taboo against their useage is that much weaker - it's more 'normal' to have one, thus more criminals are comfortable with their useage.<br>
<br>
Should America choose to practise gun control any changes in that code of behaviour would not be overnight, it would take probably 10 - 20 years at least for opinions to be modified by custom I think. &lt;Safety clause&gt; Since i don't live in America of course all this is purely conjecture on my part <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwelfnvhal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DwelfnVhal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 253<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/20/02 10:51:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3405.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow, Crime, that's tough.</span><hr size=1> Argh, the safety clause sounds arrogant and it wasn't meant too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Ignore it please.<br>

Just as an aside, do your military &quot;peace keeping officers&quot; in Northern Ireland carry firearms? Of course, armored personnel carriers and rubber bullets can't be deemed firearms...I guess.<br>

     You are correct about the presence of a firearm even if it is an officer's. If memory serves me correctly statistically speaking more US police officers are killed with thier own firearm than with another firearm actually carried by a suspect. When I first got onto my dept our armorer who also happens to be our firearms instructor made it very clear during our initial training that ALL confrontations are armed conforntations because you (the police officer) bring the firearm to the conforntation. I would agree with you on this point. Officers have come up with ways to counter this by doing things like carrying back-up weapons (on various parts  our body depending on personal prefernce), learning how to disable our own firearm, wearing body armor that is classified to stop the caliber of weapon we carry, etc. Companies that contract with law enforcement have also been of great help with the above stated body armor production, saftey holsters (of many varieties) which hinder us little in drawing but one must know HOW to draw the firearm thus greatly hindering a suspect from drawing it from our hip, etc. I would bet pounds to pents <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  it is daily getting harder and harder for a police officer to be disarmed or injured with his own firearm through training and technology. All that being said, I still agree with you we (the police officers) bring the gun. I wil say thought that on a dailky basis I am more worried about getting run over by some inattentive driver than I am about getting shot.<br>

     The scenario you presented is a textbook take down of a fleeing driver. Things are rarley if ever textbook for a variety of reasons. First you have to have the budget to actually afford a helicopter (most Jurisdictions don't), second you have to have terrain that a helicopter would actually be usefull. In my city, a midsize, historic, southern city with a LOT of trees a helicopter is not fesible for either bugetary or terrain reasons. I do wish it was that easy though but, it isn't. Ask you own Bobbies and they will tell you. <br>
<br>
     To answer your question I will be painfully honest. No, I stand by my conviction of the right to bear arms. If there were no firearms people would still find a way to kill each other. <br>
<br>
     As far as getting rid of firearms in the US, won't happen, not in my lifetime at least and probalby not in my grandchildrens (should I have any <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) lifetime either.I will probably catch hell for this but, here it goes, we Americans for the most part really are the &quot;cowboys&quot; the rest of the world seems to think we are. Many of us, about 80 million or more legally registered firearm owners, view firearms as just not a tool or a  piece of sporting equipment but, as a birthright. Something we are garunteed to have at our disposal. This feeling is still deeply rooted in our culture and probably dates back to our &quot;conquest&quot; of the west and even the role the common man with a rifle played in the founding of our country during the Revolutionary War. This attitude and the fact that the number of leagally owned firearms is probably five to ten times the number of legal owners of these firearmes is the reason gun control and gun removal has and probably won't happen in the US. It is also most likely the reason the US will not enter into many treaties with the UN which contain some sort of firearm control in them. A little know fact is that treaties entered with other countries supercede rights garunteed by our Constitution. <br>
<br>
     All in all though, as I said before, apples and oranges. England does it thier way, we do it ours and we are all happy with the outcome. <br>

<br>
Taken out of context as it was my quote might sound funny but you'll notice I said &quot;if i could&quot;. I'm not naive enough to think you just go and destroy all the guns but IF you could pass a law to stop guns being sold to the general public then you'd go a long way to that over time. But due to the fact guns still work that are 400 years old you're going to be arming your police for at least that long and I support that.<br>
<br>
I am fairly sure that someday there will be a politician in America who gets this law passed but probably not in any of our livetimes.<br>
<br>
Yes, I'm not sure what you mean when you talk about Terrain where Helicopters would not be of any use but I do understand the talk about budget for helicopters.<br>
<br>
Celdor. IRA. Irish Republican Army. Note that last word. An army that has killed 40 times more civillians than have ever been killed as a result of terrorism against America. An army of people carrying fully automatic rifles, grenades, missile launchers, who have a public following of supporters fighting for a hyrda of reasons, religion, money, power. <br>
<br>
Then you have the Real Irish Republican Army, seperatist groups that have been formed into cells 35 years ago. People that work committing acts of atrocity supported by nobody. Essentially madmen.<br>
<br>
If you want to make a thread about the conflict in Northern Ireland and England then feel free. I may respond but I'd probably leave it to a number of people who could bury you in a mound of facts but in a thread about policing, and gun control in America you just sound ignorant, especially when you consider that 5 out of the last 7 arms shipments that were stopped at customs and believed to be going to the R. IRA came from America. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
I own a firearm and I wouldn't be to happy if I had to give it up.  Thankfully I haven't had to use it other than the occasional target practice.  I am extremely careful with my weapon.  I take all precautions while cleaning it and I never EVER point it at anyone, even while unloaded, unless that person is breaking into my home.  I'm also not one of these thugs that feels that owning a gun gives me some sort of power.  I'd much rather settle things with my fists, but when someone breaks into my home, I won't be taking any chances. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1700<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/21/02 4:41:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3405.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wow, Crime, that's tough.</span><hr size=1> Carathos, I and many other people in counties that dont have legalised guns respect your right to bear arms.

Would you give your gun up if you knew that nobody else had a gun?<br>
<br>
Although selling guns to the public isn't the main cause of the issue it is a cause. A lot of the guns obtained illegally originally come from legal sources.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, 7,000 baseball bats were sold in the UK last year. It is estimated that 2,000 of them were bought by schools and that 4,500 were bought as a means of self defence. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

It is part of our national philosophy. Kerryn asked a valid point of whether we would give up guns if everyone else did. The problem is, everyone else includes the rest of the world, not just America.<br>
<br>
Let me point out something about this national philosophy. Gun ownership was placed into our Constitution as a final safeguard from a dictatorship, any dictatorship. This same philosophy helps explain one reason among many why the US fought and is fighting in WW II, Vietnam, Somalia, Bosnia, Kuwait, Afghanistan, etc. etc. etc. <br>
<br>
WTF am I talking about? I am talking about a country willing to send our men and women to DIE to fight oppression and dictatorship. We have done it throughout history. When viewed in that light, having our own citizens die to higher gun crime than other countries is just another *price* to pay to carry on this fight. <br>
<br>
Whether you agree with the underlying philosophy is irrelevant, because it is the philosophy America chose and still chooses to follow. And it is a good thing we did, or you would be typing on this ezboard in German, Val, and you sure as hell would not be posting your opinions about government and guns, because you would not be allowed to have one. The US hesitated almost too long in WW II because we had some doubts of our national philosophy about fighting dictators and dealing with foreign affairs then.<br>
<br>
People argue that being shot and killed everyday is not a price worth paying for freedom, because America will *never lose ours* (that's sarcasm) But as usual, they do not carry this argument to conclusion. <br>
<br>
The German people as a whole were/are not stupid, or morally devoid, yet they created the biggest threat to free humanity in recorded history, given that perfect political environment and the perfect (evil) man. <br>
<br>
Same applies to the Arabic nations. Brilliant people, with an enlightened culture so advanced that Europe should have been embarrassed during the middle ages. This was a people that conquered and traded from the borders of China to Spain. Look at it now, a region so oppressed and fanaticized that peace for the region seems an impossibility for even the most visionary of dreamers. No one can predict when or where such a situation may arise again, so the best thing to do is be prepared to guard against it. <br>
<br>
America decided preparing against it happening in this country included arming our citizens. Let me make it perfectly clear that I am not advocating assasinating presidents, etc. But I am pointing out that final solution (and thus that huge deterrent) is in fact available to a our populace, as our forefathers (revolutionaries themselves) intended.  I may sound paranoid, but the world would be well served to be paranoid of another Hitler or Saddam Hussein rising to power. Complacency and apathy are the tools of dictators.<br>
<br>
*************************************<br>
<br>
As an aside to the gun and threat argument, I will point out that terrorists managed to kill 3,000+ people using their minds, 15-18 plane tickets, and some $2 boxcutters.<br>
<br>
The IRA was still getting 2 shipments of weapons and grenades! (that's crazy, and this is according to others figures) from places other than the US, and are fighting a psuedo-war that as far as I know has been going on since the Church of England let Henry get his divorce, and because they think the Brits are too stuck up or something.<br>

Terrorists today aren't fighting with guns. They're fighting with anthrax powder and planes and bombs. How does arming civilians help fight Anthrax?<br>
<br>
You talk about all these wars that America fights in and owning guns is the price you must pay for fighting that war. That's rubbish. Contrary to some people's opinions the Americans do not stand alone in these wars. Sure there are a larger number but roughly equal amounts on a percentage basis of very many other countries who do not arm civilians or police officers. Fighting wars has nothing to do with policing or the ownership of guns.<br>
<br>
Don't kid yourself when you think that the right to own a gun has anything to do with aything other then protecting from other American citizens.<br>
<br>
Carathos has it right. If nobody has guns then he doesn't need one. Presumably like me he has a bat and an intent to kill someone if its a last cause.<br>
<br>
This is not some zealot crusade on my part. If you want a gun, fine.

It doesn't matter if you take away guns.  If a gun is taken away, people resort to other items for self-defense. <br>
<br>
You just showed it very clearly Kerryn. Thanks for the repeated examples of the bats. Even though you are superior to us poor Americans because you don't have guns, you still talk casually about resorting to deadly force with a lesser object. <br>
