While I can see your point of view when taking in a certain context, we havnt had any run in's with DG in quite some time and I for one hope that its a trend that continues.  That issue is long put to bed and forgotten rest assured.<br>

As far as I know, no one in PC hates LoR. But I must admit it gets tiring to see PC getting blamed for actions that are pretty despicable and highly unlikely.<br>
<br>
PC member trained CoV faction mobs on LoR over a scout spawn conflict. (I was online when I heard my guildies surprise to find the tools turned in and captain walked over them at charrissa without warning.) (btw, that is a bad place to fight, wanderers) (and possible chain aggro) (Is it not also possible that a KoS member picked up the aggro when he was out hunting dragons and picked up aggro while coming in?) blame the fat guy, eh? /nudge Zeno. That was just a F'd up situation and it was sad to see people pointing fingers. Even after PC left the captain alone and offered to help rez.<br>
<br>
PC tried to KS Lodizal. (Lodizal is a race of force, 1st people to engage the mob with resonable force gets the kill) (80-90% of PC didn't even engage. The 10-20% that was on it was not likely grouped together and backed off within 5-10 seconds after hearing confirmation that it wasn't PC's mob.)<br>
<br>
Both are pretty gross accusations and I can understand if people get upset by them. To me, they are just situation that got blown way out of proportion. I pesonally hold no grudge what-so-ever against LoR, I just wish some members were a little less quick in judgement and even slower with the finger pointing. I have grouped with many of you before and after these incidents without ever giving it a second thought.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, I was one of the 10-20% that had engaged the mob and backed off when I got confirmation that it wasn't PC that had first engaged the mob. If by some miracle, we had KS'd it, I don't think any of our members would have looted it without straightening out who it belonged to first.<br>

<br>
Yes, I was in velks on the infamous night.  <br>
<br>
I was in a ledge group with several other members of Chaotic Delusions, you can verify this with Iizzard, Rexfel or Aziline.  Zarukami who isn't in our guild  was also there and a friend of mine.  In the previous three hours before the 'Tymex comment' we had two members of League of Ronin join our group and leave us on a moments notice.  (I would have kept their names but I didn't know this was gonna be a cry fest).<br>
<br>
Now, having a shaman leave ledge group w/o waiting for a replacement or giving any warning ain't that big of a deal but its annoying as hell.  So...when Tymex made a comment about Munji or whatever her name is, I simply said /ooc well thats League of Ronin for ya.<br>
Banisher (whom I've known awhile and think of as a good friend) understandably said /ooc wtf? or something like that.  To which I gave a '<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ' to show that I was saying said comment in jest.  (because honestly pal, I don't hold an entire gulid responsible for something a couple people do).<br>
 <br>
About five minutes later I get a tell from Tokum (our guild leader) asking me what was going on.  I told him I cracked a joke about LoR, and would refrain in the future.<br>
<br>
So Mr. LoR guild leader, we already took your advice.  You advised my guild leader of the situation, he sent me a tell we got it resolved.  I haven't made any  public comments  about your guild since.  However, resolving the issue by the terms you stated in your first post is not enough for you, you still flamed us and won't let it go.<br>
<br>
Your real problem lies in the fact that some of your guild members are in fact flakes and giving the rest of you a bad name.  There are LOTS of people in LoR that I consider friends.  But you have some real bad apples in your guild.  YOU have given them your name and YOU don't take responsibilty for their actions.  You flamed my whole guild for something I did, yet when people in YOUR guild screw up you won't accept it.<br>
<br>
What you need to do is take your own advice, and look into these matters BEFORE you do something so stupid and post it here.   Good god man, if you read your first post you'd see the horrific amount of hypocracy  you've displayed.<br>

If any1 ever has a problem with any members of CD at any time i am normally on and expect a tell to inform me. I would like to keep CD's rep on Emarr a good one and can only do that if i know when one of our members is havin a problem, feel free to talk to me anytime.<br>

ps: for the record CD has absolutly no problems with LoR to date, a few of your members have reflected poorly on you and i hope u can solve the problems you are havin in guild, keep in touch guys and hope the wrong perceptions have not been gathered from this post even tho i feel they probally allrdy have.<br>

In several instances people say that there have been several people in LoR that have impaacted and given the guild a bad rep. Yet in just about all these cases you fail to point out who those people are. Now i'm sure quite a few of you are not putting any names simply not to accuse that person/s wrongly incase you are wrong. I can see some justice in that but if you are going to make the point at all in the first place that people in LoR have been giving them a bad rep why not tell them who those people are so that they can fix the problem eh? That would be more help than just posting how &quot;its not my guilds fault. Maybe its those people in your guild that have been giving you guys a bad name.&quot; And i dont mean just post so and so is the one giving you a bad name, give them specifics so that they know your not just busting someones chops because you have a vendetta against them. That way the issue can be resolved and all can get on with their lives and just play the game. Its a GAME. It was created so that people could have some fun. Arguing with other people is not my idea of fun as i am sure most of you don't enjoy it either. Therefore if you think the problom is with LoR members then point out those troublesome members for them and what they have done (with some decent evidence, not just idle accusation) so that the matter at hand can be put to a rest.<br>

<br>
More likely they just can't remember the name of the LoR member.  I've been present on several occasions when people from LoR made total asses of themselves by bragging about how great they were or by flashing an &quot;I'm too uber for you&quot; attitude.  Could I tell you who they were?  No.  I honestly don't remember the names.<br>
<br>
If you have any doubt about whether LoR is acting like that, just go back and read Parra's original post.  If the leader of the guild is saying &quot;I've got underwear more uber than you&quot; (or whatever his exactly words were), you know what kind of tone is being set in that guild.<br>
<br>
Does this mean that LoR is full of bad people?  Naw.  I mostly find them amusing.  Parra might even manage to clear out the losers and turn LoR into a big time guild some day.  He's got a tough job on his hands, but maybe he can pull it off. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

If I had a dollar for everytime someone said oh I have to go then leaves in velks i'd be rich.  Many of the people who have done this are in some pretty big guilds. Sure it's not fun for those who are staying, it's frustrating but it is not the end of the world. This is a game in the end and there a lot worse things people have done then leave a group on short notice. <br>

I alerted Chen about who Iikes actually was. I told him that she was not good people. a few days later, she doesn't have the tag.<br>
<br>
Anotherhealer is not the same anotherhealer of old. He is completely different, and is actually an okay guy. Having run ins with the OLD anotherhealer, i had my doubts as well, but those have been removed.<br>
<br>
Guys...its hard starting out. People have problems making a name for themselves. PC, an established and well-to-do guild clashing with LoR, a fresh start-up, still wet behind the ears? knock it off. LoR, i suggest members stop posting in this folder, and this topic. It'll only get you into trouble.<br>
<br>
i have lots of friends in PC. i also have friends in LoR. if i can see the good in two groups like this, then anyone can.<br>
<br>
in not so many words...<br>
KNOCK IT OFF..<br>
