Ya know, I started to make another post containing pertinent information etc etc...but frankly Chit,  you are wasting my time.  It is not my job to take you in hand and make you prove your claims.  It is not my job to explain anything to you since you chose to air your problems on this board.  I shouldnt have to be spending an hour + of my day every day reading this.  I have spent more time here in the last week than I have in the last 8 months.<br>
<br>
I have no beef with starting crap with any officer in my guild.  Every one of them would probably tell you that at some time or another I have.  To suggest that I am somehow afraid of Hoppkins is absurd.  Big farging deal...hes a cleric, last I checked there was a lot of clerics on emarr, if one goes another will replace them.  Dont get me wrong, I dont want to see anyone go, but our guild dynamics make it so that we dont have to &quot;depend on&quot; or &quot;tolerate&quot; anyone strictly because of their raiding abilities or class.  We get along just fine no matter &quot;who&quot; leaves.  We learned that lesson the hard way and worked to stop that from ever happening again.<br>
<br>
If you would like to continue to pursue your complaint Chit, feel free to email me with ALL PERTINENT DETAILS.  Tho, frankly since you have come here and forced some 30ish pages of posts about CE with bogus complaints that you are only just now attempting to prove, I really dont give a @#%$ about making sure that everyone treated you fairly.  You certainly didnt treat us fairly.  Youve accused our officers of being untouchable, you complained about special treatment when the only person that got special treatment was you, you called Tilian a liar when he had done no so such thing and attempted to slander our guild on this board.  And we should do what exactly for you?  Treat you like you treated us?  Whatever Hopp was posting in reference too above, he nailed it on the head.  You are all about getting attention for yourself as evidenced by you airing your problem here cause you were too lazy to prove your story in the first place.  I wont be back posting anymore about this Chit.  And Ill go ahead and say in advance that just because I dont respond to any more of your foolish ranting does not make me guilty of anything.  You seem to think someones silence makes you right.  Im afraid that simply isnt the case.  Ive wasted more time with these threads you started Chit than you ever put in to our guild.  I owe you 2 things exactly.  Jack and @#%$.

Sometimes... just sometimes, I think that Chiteng is some eccentric genius that is doing all this for his own sense of twisted humor.  <br>
<br>
Somewhere deep down (okay not THAT deep down, but like just below the skin) he knows he's just being obstinate, and obtuse - playing devil's advocate for the most absurd reasons.  At those times I imagine he has a wall diagram of who and how he's irritated folks... and how best to keep it going so he can make them squirm with his devious ineptitude.<br>

One I will win easy,<br>
Hoppkins does post here. He does it to flame. That is against guild policy. Yes I am unpopular enough that no one will dare publicly support me on that. But, there is no reason to believe he will stop. You see Ninya,<br>
as his target, I have had a long tme to observe his behavior. It may well be that CE will choose to ignore what he does, THAT is true. But he wont stop posting.<br>
There is no chance in hell of that. Each post makes a mockery of your guild policy. You should remove it.<br>
<br>
You say you wont post any longer and that was expected, but that too doesnt matter. Anyone on this<br>
board can search Hoppkins posts, and mine.<br>
You cant find even ONE of my posts prior to Tils<br>
flamming me, where I flammed Hoppkins. It isnt the act<br>
of a good guildmate to do that. I dont care if all 60<br>
active members come here and denounce me, nothing will change the fact that he is guilty as hell. Nothing will change the fact that Til gave me permission to post.<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
Now as to the harrassment issue. I didnt go on the raid to nail Hoppkins. I dont have a log of the event.<br>
I assumed (foolishly) that since you knew me, and since I wasnt lying, that the guild leadership would actually do something. Obviously I was wrong. If you wish to create<br>
a standard of proof that I cant possibly meet, you can.<br>
Fine Ninya you win. I cant 'prove' anything to you about that issue. But he still did it. he knows it, and I know it,<br>
and quite frankly most of the board knows it. Because they know HIM. It is something that he does. <br>
<br>
From my point of view you can have him. I am better off<br>
not in a guild that refuses to lean on him. If you think<br>
he doesnt do it to other people, you are foolish. You just gave him encouragement to keep doing it. Sooner or later<br>
the truth will surface. Not it wont aid me, but thats life.<br>
<br>
The guild gave me one small leather glove, that I cannot return. My existance posed no burden to it. Stop<br>
complaining that I didnt contribute. If I have to endure<br>
a creep like Hoppkins to contribute, I wont contribute.<br>
<br>
Dews, I will forgive. He is just being loyal, and he is young. Loyalty is admirable.<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont call your unwillingness to post anything. That is a Raedwulf trick. It simply doesnt matter to me.<br>

<br>
If you believe that, then why did you let it happen?  Why not throw him on ignore if he was harassing you so much? Why did you let him &quot;win this round&quot;?  If you saw it coming, then you obviously had the insight to do something about it.  You come here wanting people to feel sympathetic for you when most are happy that you are reaping what you sow.  I tend to agree with cerulean,  you are not an idiot.  You just seem to have a skewed version of what the majority of people see.  <br>
<br>
I bring something else to your attention.  You have teetered on the edge of harassment on this boards for as long as i can remember.  What makes what you do and what you say Hoppkins did any different?  It all comes down to point of view.  Yours is not the only one that exists.  I know typing this that it falls on deaf ears and i am wasting my time.  But at some point in your existance, there will come a time when you have to look at the man in the mirror instead of blaming others.  It basically comes down to treat others as you want others to treat you.  I have done my best to be as none-biased and baiting as possible.  Post your sincere thoughts instead of obscure innuendos and you might actually get somewhere.  Just my opinion.  Take it or leave it.<br>

There are a few other things that he got that we will let ride for now.<br>

Yes I am extreme, this is hardly a secret. What you dont<br>
acknowledge is that this board is not representative of anything. Nothing. The people who post on it rarely agree with each other, let alone me. So I dont let these little things bother me. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My 'crusade' ended well over a month ago. No idea<br>
why people keep brining it up. I need names of major<br>
exploiters to restart it. I dont see anyone doing that.<br>

<br>
This board may not be representative of anything to you, but it's a place for the ideas, beliefs, and thoughts of players on Emarr.  For some it represents amusement of one sort or another.  <br>
<br>
You simply backtrack and double-talk from one post to another and sticking your nose in where you know people don't want it.  Yes, this is a public forum for all to read and respond, but everyone has repeatedly expressed their desire for you to leave @#%$ be.  Even when you agree with the poster they tell you to shut up.  Doesn't that clue you in yet?  I can't even really flame you because your posts are so obtuse and ignorant I just find myself wondering how you survive IRL.  You're just a sad little man that feels by continually posting you might find meaning to your existance since you have no other way of influencing the lives of anyone but yourself.<br>

that explains to me why so many people feel your such a nice guy. You certainly cant prove it by me. Jumping in on threads and telling me I am wrong certainly doesnt show me much except that your boorish and pandering.<br>
<br>
People that agree with me on WHAT? Hoppkins? In general? What exactly? To pretend that anyone who <br>
posted here in support of me would not be treated harshly would be a lie. So no I will not ask anyone to do that. <br>
<br>
I never heard of Affliction either. Are they better than Magister? I know you have a couple members that post here. From their posts I have to say it doesnt speak well<br>
of the guild.<br>
<br>
Like I told you, you know what to do if you actually want a dialouge =) Until then your just another Bozo<br>
on a crowded stage. As for me, I think I am better off<br>
w/o such people as I witness here. YOU can have people<br>
liek Raedwulf and Carathos =) By all means, allow them<br>
