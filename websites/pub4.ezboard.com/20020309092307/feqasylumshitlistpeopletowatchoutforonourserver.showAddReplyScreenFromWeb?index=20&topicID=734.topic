Unfortunately, some people don't know about /ignore and have to put up with BS from arses like Poppa. The trouble is, there isn't a thing they can do about it because a GM won't do anything (99% of the time) so there you are stuck putting up with hours of crap from this idiot until it makes you camp. IMHO there is no difference between a ninja looter and someone who acts like this out of pure spite. They are both wrong. They should recieve a warning, then a suspension, then a ban. period.

I know that he is a little kid and doesnt really know the rules of the game.  I spent some time working with him and think he is getting better.   I do know that I want to add a lil something to this post... He died and lost his lvl and his spells as was posted earlier... My husband got home and I asked him to help poppa get his lvl back.. He grouped with him for a bit and then died.  Of course poppa had lost his lvl earlier and was unable to res his corpse.. My husband wasnt mad he died because of another persons train.  But poppa and someone else in zone teamed up got his lvl back all so that he could res my hubby...  All in all i think that he is a good person with much to learn....<br>

<br>
I was in ICO killing cougars when this little guy came around about a week ago or so.  Don't remember all the specifics anymore, but he kept asking for money for his spells with us, too.  Also, he inspected me and immediately offerred some stuff along with 100pp, demanding my bracers.  I said no, and seeing that he seemed young, I decided to give him a chance and let him join our group (he was lvl 29 at the time).  <br>
<br>
Fast forward.... this guys was quite annoying, but it really seemed like he was simply young and didn't understand.  We were getting annoyed with him, but we were putting up with him, especially since I am a cleric too and we didn't have to count on him for anything.  Well, at one point we all died, and he was the first to corpses.  Remember we are all still grouped.  Well, he revived me and our tank in an unsafe place, and we all immediately died.  Of course, we aren't happy about being revive-killed, but what really sucked was that he then asked for a donation for it!  Unbelieveable.  Well, our tank and a friend of mine logged.<br>
<br>
On the other hand.... I was pretty angry... but I decided to see if I could do a little tutoring, and so I did.  Popa was quite receptive to what I had to say.  We let him join our group again, and he was quite apologetic for three hours.  We didn't have any further problems, and I gave him some EQ courtesy tips like don't beg, don't revive-kill, don't ask for rez donations in your group, don't inspect without permission, etc.  He was really excited to get some help.  I also spent a few hours teaching him how to use the hotkeys, which he didn't seem to be familiar.<br>
<br>
Quite honestly, I think he is never going to be a great cleric, and is quite immature.  But hopefully he will be a little better now, and for that entire night we was truly interested in trying to be better.<br>
<br>
and that's my 2cp.<br>

First thing he asked me was for one of my bracers.  He thought they were better than they actually are.<br>
<br>
We then headed off to kill Ulthorks.  He immediately asked if he could have all the tusks.  I informed him that I knew of the Othmir quest and thought it was fair if we rolled for the tusks if any were to drop.  He started offering to pay 5 pp for any tusks I had, and any tusks that would drop.  Again I told him no, we were all interested in the quest.<br>
<br>
Nothing but a little annoying.  I wouldn't sl him for this.  Just chuckled a little when I saw this thread here.<br>

Seems like he's getting a little better though, he's offering to pay for the stuff he wants and wants now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Still has alot to learn though, didn't like hearing that one of the first things he did was ask for the bracers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I think i'll leave him on ignore just a little longer and see what happens.  Keep posting your encounters.  I do have hopes that one day he will be a productive member of the Lanys Community, just has some growing up to do. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
