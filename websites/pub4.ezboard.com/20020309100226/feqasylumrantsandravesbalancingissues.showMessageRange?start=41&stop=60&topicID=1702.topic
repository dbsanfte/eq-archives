<br>
[q]<br>
I seem to recall a certain country dropping atom bombs on two cities full of innocent people and killing about 100,000 people......do the people in that country deserve to die?<br>
[/q]<br>
<br>
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were home to large Japanese military bases.  They were chosen as targets because of that fact, not because America wanted to obliterate as many civilians as possible.  To wit:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I have told the Sec of War...to use [the atomic bomb] so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children....[W]e as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop this terrible bomb on the old capital or the new....The target will be a purely military one and we will issue a warning statement asking the Japs to surrender and save lives.  I'm sure that they will not do that, but we will have given them a chance.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Harry Truman, as quoted in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Truman</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by David McCullouch, p. 444<br>
<br>
Defense documents at the time indicated that the United States would incur at least a quarter million casualties during the invasion of Japan.  It seemed likely that the Japanese people would be exterminated because it was believed that they would rather die than surrender.  Allied intelligence services believed the War would last another year.  Truman chose to save the lives of countless people by authorizing the use of the bomb.  And before you criticize him, let's face it: Many of us wouldn't even exist had we invaded Japan because our grandfathers would have died.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic.<br>
<br>
[q]<br>
They were trying to do more than just kill Americans. They were people from poor countries making a statement about capitalist business and political practices.<br>
[/q]<br>
<br>
Osama is a multimillionaire expatriate of Saudi Arabia.  He's hardly impoverished.  He's exploiting the suffering of other people for his own aggrandizement, not protesting America's foreign policy.  If he were truly interested in the welfare of Palestinians or Afghanis or whoever, would he not give them most of his fortune and use his influence to get Middle Eastern governments to do the same?  Instead he foments the destruction of lives and property and manipulates emotions by talking about how unfair America is.  And the sad thing is, much of this could have been avoided if only that sack of guano Clinton had been minding the store instead of nailing interns and launching missile strikes to cover his ass when he was caught in his own web of lies.  <br>
<br>
[q]<br>
...governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it...<br>
[/q]<br>
<br>
Interesting how it is that when a militia uses Jefferson's quote to make a point about their perception of American government, they're called traitors and lunatics; but the same quote absolves anti-American terrorists (the Taliban now, the SDS and the Weather Underground and the Panthers back in the 60's and 70's) because theirs were the actions of people &quot;protesting the inequities of American imperialism,&quot; as the dolts at Cornell used to say back in the 80's.  If we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> want fairness and equity, then we cannot employ double standards, right?<br>
<br>
What struck me about his statements was this:<br>
<br>
[q]<br>
Asked if he would allow public access to his vast landholdings in Montana,<br>
he replied: &quot;Can I live in your home with you? We believe in private<br>
property in this country.&quot; <br>
&quot;You buy it and you can share it,&quot; Turner said.<br>
[/q]<br>
<br>
What he's saying is, I'll spit on the graves of the those who died from terrorist attacks, and criticize Americans for having far too much.  But if you expect me to give up any of the luxuries that I have so that I can truly practice what I preach, you can piss up a rope.  <br>
<br>
A psychiatrist would have a field day with him. <br>

Why cant we have the economists work on this also? Maybe when somthing is discovered it could be implemented slowly without crushing the economy. The fact that we are such big consumers of oil means that in the end we fund these terrorist groups and give them power. I realize that an endeavour like that would take many years, BUT that shouldnt deterr us. This would be an endeavor worth working towards and no one should say it is impossible. Many things that we used to think were impossible are now possible and in use.<br>
<br>
Finding an alternative that is not harmful to the environment and takes financial power from the arab countries seems like a long term goal we should be working on.[/q]<br>
<br>
Nuclear power is safe and a hell of a lot cleaner than coal burning power plants.  (My brother, a former physicist until he went bad and became a lawyer, used to tell me that the NYSEG power plant 15 miles down the raod produced more radiation than a nuclear plant.)  Unfortunately, since Three Mile Island, it's virtually impossible for any nuclear plants to go online in the US.  Hydro plants are good, but there are just so many rivers you can dam, especially when you have to worry about spawn points and such.  It's feasible to convert coal to oil via a method developed by the Germans 60 years ago, but its expense isn't justified unless and until we run out of oil deposits.  So we're left with either buying oil from OPEC or tapping into the ANWAR oil fields.  Given the power of the environmental movement, it's pretty much a given that we'll be buying oil from other countries for as long as they have any.<br>

<br>
And Baleric... I studied Three Mile Island and Chernobyl in University.  The reasons why Nuclear Power isn't safe is not because of the physics, but rather the human factor.  You'll have to remember that humans are the technicians and operators for Nuclear Power Plants.  You'd be astounded by the small mistakes that can chain react to create huge potentials for disaster.  Nuclear Power will continue to be frowned upon as a major energy source until we manage to minimize human error, and that will be extremely difficult at best.  (PS... I think the reason for TMI was a tag over a broken switch, which covered an indicator light... yes something that small caused a HUGE problem... I'll confirm this when I find that darned book on case studies on Human Factors).<br>

If it's such a dangerous power source, why is it that European countries rely on nuclear reactors for most of their electricity?  And bear in mind that the Europeans are even more hyper over the environment than we are in the States.  <br>

The reason he's a turd is that he delights in supporting evil and gets hyper when anyone calls him on it.

Would you excuse that?

Probably not, but the families of the innocent G.I.s who didn't want a war sympathized wholeheartedly with the decision, because it saved their husbands, sons, fathers, and brothers from dying in a war not started by them.<br>

<br>
The europeans have a totally differant strategy for using nuclear power than Americans do.  They recycle most all of the materials so there is little waste.  The upside to this is, low ammounts of waste and more effecient uses of the resources.  The downside is that the process by which you must recycle enriched uranium creates weapons grade plutonium.  This is what drives the US nuts.  we dont want terrorst freaks getting hold of plutonium from europe and bringing thier briefcase nukes over to this country and destroying cities.<br>
<br>
Now in the US we dont create plutonium from enriched uranium but have EXTREME waste problems.  It is a VERY serious problem because if a terrorist attacks a nuclear plant, they arent going for the reactor, they will be going for the decontamination facilities.  This is because the fule rods that are spent in the reaction process are laid in pools of chilled watter untill the can be dealt with.  Due to beaurocracy however no plan has been enacted in the last 30 years to deal with all this speant fuel.  As a result of the sept 11 attacks, the goverment became committed to dealing with this issue and will take this waste from the plants and move it inside a mountain in SW Nevada at the nuclear testing grounds on the AF base there.<br>
<br>
The new problem is that we will have to transport this wastes across 50 states from the various temporary facilities on trains and caravans.. Can you even imagine the impacts of any crashes or terroist attacks while this is going thru your city?  Estimates have cleanup at 2 BILLION dollars if such a train was to wreck.<br>

<br>
On a personal note:<br>
<br>
After my time spent on AD, in the gulf, and reservist for nearly 8 years... My training as a corpsman / medic and prior trauma experience never prepared me for what I experienced those days..<br>
<br>
I received a phone call on campus about 20 minutes after the second plane hit the WTC. Within an hour I was on my way to NYC - as part of the emergency call up of the NY National Guard. <br>
<br>
Between my picking up stray body parts and tissues, as well as keeping frenzied media people out of the site for the next couple weeks (one guy had the gaul to try to sneak in wearing an army uniform), I can tell you first hand this was not the work of bravery.<br>
<br>

  Yes. Their country launched a unprovoked surprise attack on the USA.  Any one who attacks us will get smacked down. Hard.  Funny thing is, a lot of the revisionist tend to over look the fact that we saved the Japanese people by nuke’en two of their cities.  It may be hard for some people to understand, but read the Japanese plans, and the way they (including the civilians) conducted the war up to that time.  The Japanese people would have literally fought to the death rather than surrender. <br>
   As a side note, another reason we picked those two cities to nuke is because up to that time, both were relatively undamaged. So the psychological impact of one bomb was magnified. <br>
   Dropping the bomb gave the Japanese a face-saving way to admit that the war was over and they lost. <br>
<br>
    As far as Ted is concerned, just because he has the defended (but not by him) right to free speech does not change the fact that he is a moron with serious mental problems.  Any one remember his “revised 10 commandments” he came out with about 10 years ago?? Any one who thinks he has the authority to revise the 10 commandments has major ego problems.<br>
<br>
  The moral dilemma with Hanoi Jane is…..if you did find her on fire, do you piss on her or just sit and watch?  Tuff call.  Being a pro-active kinda guy, I would piss on her, but not enough to put out the fire. But I do understand how some one else would rather pull up a chair and enjoy the sight. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They have a sick sense that they are fighting for freedom when they do this. They were in no way shape or form justified in their attack but doing something KNOWING your going to die from it isn't cowardice<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->These people sneak into the country, under the guise of something they're not, pretending they are average citizens of other countries here to learn or make a living for themselves, all the while hiding behind the guise of anonymity, abusing the freedoms we grant them while in this country, knowing that they can escape our attention by claiming to be something they're not.  Then they pretend to be civilian passengers on a civilian transport, just to get on board the plane to carry out their &quot;mission&quot;.  They then take a plane full of civilians hostage, essentially both hiding behind hostages, and using them as a weapon...and they ram a civilian transport into a building, killing all on board, and many in the building.  They do this because their religion has been so skewed that they think by simply killing Americans they will go straight to paradise, where 72 virgins will be waiting for them.(and beats the hell outta me what they think is gonna be so special about 72 virgins, after they've de-virginized them(also, assuming they intend to -do- anything with them))  That's not bravery, bravery is not wanting to die for your own reasons.  Bravery is wanting to live, but being willing to die to protect the lives and freedoms of other people, selflessly giving of themselves for the sakes of others.  There is nothing selfless about these terrorists, and the only way they can accomplish anything is by remaining anonymous and ultimately attacking civilians.  The only way they can survive as individuals and organizations is by blending into the background and hiding among law-abiding people.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Second as revealed in the Osama video only the pilots knew what was really going on, all the other terrorists thought it was a regular hijacking. They didnt know they were going to kill thousands of innocent people. Yes i know hijacking in and of itself is still one of the shittyest things a human could possibly do, but hijacking and crashing a plane into a fucking building are very diferent<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The only reason for that is because they wanted to keep it a secret, the less people that know, the better chance of that.  Make no mistake about it, the people who join these organizations don't do it out of pacifistic reasons, they have no qualms about killing civilians by the thousands, and just because they didn't know that's what they were there to do, by NO means says that they were of a different mindset.  And being willing to hijack a plane and kill all those on it, is morally no different than being willing to kill others with said plane, the only difference is size and scope.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mendan said:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Soory, but for a moment I have to play devil's advocate. It seems people are saying that only &quot;Asshole chicken-shit pussy-wipes&quot; would only kill &quot;thousands of innocent people who have no idea what is about to happen and have absolutely no way to defend themsevles&quot;. And that those who support those kind of attacks deserve to die. I seem to recall a certain country dropping atom bombs on two cities full of innocent people and killing about 100,000 people......do the people in that country deserve to die? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->At the end of the war, Japan knew its goose was cooked, so they retreated to their home isle, and fortified the hell out of it.  They knew they could not win, but they took a purely defensive position, hoping to inflict massive casualties on the allies when they would try to end the war by invading their country.  Japan made its choice, so too did the US(and assumedly the allies)...it was by no means a perfect choice, but there was no perfect choice in this situation.  As Vanamar said, they saved endless scores of lives on both sides in the long run, so unfortunately, it worked.  And as Balearic said, the target was military, despite that they knew civilians would be killed too.  The Japanese were given a warning, they chose to ignore it.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The war on terrorism can't be won just by killing all terrorists, it has to involve looking from thier perspective and finding a way to change it so they see how horribly wrong they're actions are. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->/Nod.  I'm sure we should have just tried to see it from Hitler's perspective as well, and just had the patience to teach him how ultimately wrong genocide, other crimes against humanity, making war on the entire world, etc. were...instead of dealing with him.  Rationalizing the motives of mass-murderers doesn't do anything but give them more leeway in which to continue doing so.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Numruk said:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->I think what you guys need to stop doing is calling people anti-american traitors for not thinking the same things you do.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->It's not un-American to not think the same things we do.  It's un-American to always respect and justify the acts of killers by rationalizations that consistently blame America instead.  Remove all accountability of those who would kill others, and blame the victim instead.  It's like blaming a girl who gets raped because the rapist said she was acting and dressing &quot;slutty&quot;.  It's un-American to think that people that would hurt others simply must have some justifiable reason for doing so, it's un-American to blame America and Americans for someone wanting to kill us simply because we are Americans.  And it's blaringly obvious Ted Turner is one of those people.<br>

The Decalartion of Independence does <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> apply to Taliban terrorists trying to take out the US government. If they want to oppose their OWN government, they have the right to. As Americans we have not only the right but the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> OBLIGATION</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to oppose our government if it is not adequately representing the governed. The 1st Amendement isn't limited to popular speech - it relates to all speech. Turner may not be terribly brilliant, but by expressing his views openly, he is being as American as you get. By disagreeing with him, you are also being American.<br>
<br>
Yes, the right to disagree with the govenment extends to ALL people and all views in America. The American Comunist Party has a right to speak, as did the Black Panthers, and the Vietnam war protesters in the 70's, and so do the militia weirdos in the backwoods of Montana. They don't have the right to blow things up, but they certainly have the right to hold their views, and express them at will.<br>

Does anyone here remember their American History? Does the name Joseph McCarthy ring any bells? Freedom of expressiong is essential.
