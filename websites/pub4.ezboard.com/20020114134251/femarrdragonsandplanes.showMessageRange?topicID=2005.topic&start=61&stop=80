1)  I agree with Kieara about Lendari.  She is not perfect but she is not mean or malicious.  If you look past all of her falts ( we all have them) she is a good kid.<br>
<br>
2) /agree Gilgamel<br>
<br>
3)  The first thing Zaolin said to me is to Eat a Dick.  I am sorry but if that is the first thing that I hear from you I will consider you childish.  <br>
<br>
4)  Why should I avoid argueing with some one just because some of their friends are respected officers in Uber Guilds?  Does it make them special?<br>

<br>
<br>
FEAR:<br>
My mother was nagging me about getting off of the computer to do some gay extra credit because she had called my school that day and i was failing 3 of 8 classes. So, I had to get off of the computer. The reason that I had a gate spell memmed was because I had bound in fear under advice of a friend of mine, and if things got bad in that camp spot I would have gated. I wandered off and meant to gate back to the camp, But instead I had gated out to WC because i had forgotten which place i had memmed which spell. It really was an accident, but believe what you want to believe. Jaeden, i did not dump the raid off on you. You told me that you would take the leadership if I couldnt do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
TUNIC:<br>
Okay, WTF. I did not gate out after I won the tunic. This is exactly what happened. We killed king, but couldnt handle the 8 or so other shrooms after, so I evacced us out. Me, Matril and Shadon randomed the tunic when we were all done zoning into EJ. I won the tunic. We headed back to OS, where Fizzealot said &quot;no offence, but a druid really isnt useful in king, we should get a necro or something&quot;. So, I /ooc'd for a camp check. D1 was open, and I called the camp, so if we did decide to move, it would be there for us. Sooo, it was an excellent group, and I didnt want to disband because It was still kind of early like 10pm or something, and I still had like 4 hours to play. I asked the group if they wanted to go to D1, and they said no, they wanted to go back down to king. I said okay, and then said &quot;well, why dont you get a necro then, if I am not good enough to hold the job as snarer.&quot; So, I disbanded, but that is what the group appeared to have wanted. I did not bail out as soon as I won the tunic, I did make some effort to keep the group together, just obviously with me, they wouldnt go back to the same camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
I gave the fungi tunic to Matril yesterday, and Shadon gave me my shroud back. Everything is fixed, yay, I'm done with this board, taking Gilgamel's advice when he said ignore the jackasses and keep playing. I've spent too much time on that stupid druid, and can't quit her 4 levels from 60. Laterz.<br>

Falon posted she said this was not out of of spite then added well maybe just a litte bit.  She had gone from keeping it private to posting it on a public board.  She saw an opportunity for a low blow ant took it.  I just was just being supportive of a friend.  This should sound familliar to you.  Now when Zaolin tossed out his Rude comment that is why I called him childish, no one else just him.<br>

I never once called any of her other friends anything.  Heck I don't even know them, how can I make any type of generalization about them.  Rember only ONE person used rude lamguage to me and that was Zaolin, my comments were reserved for him alone.  You might want practice what you preach and work on your comprehension.  Now when you made the comment about her friends in Uber guilds it sure sounded like a threat to me so I responed.<br>
<br>
Never said you flamed or humiliated Lendari why should I accuse you of doing so?  Now from my point of fiew you are the one that is misinterpering things so I took the time to explain what I see.<br>

<br>
Lendari - It was not my intention to get you to get you to quit the game.  Nor was it to ruin your friendships.  I don't have control over other people's reactions, I just said my mind and let things go as they may.  Never once did I send you a nasty tell IG, my first post, as I read it now, was rude.  I appologize.  I was extremely ticked and I let my emotions get the best of me.  <br>
    I do hope you see what bothered me about the situation. Namely, your actions after you evaced us out of the king area.  I did not whine in group about the loot nor did I whine to the other members.  In fact, they whined to me about it.  I did state my objections to what was going on in group.  If you took that for whining, so be it.<br>
<br>
Everyone - Please consider this thread closed.  While I don't have control over whether you continue to post here, everyone should move on.<br>
<br>
Here's how things turned out - Lendari gave the tunic to Matril (the shammy from the group).  I gave Lendari her Shroud of Nature back (which I had to go out and purchase as I had already traded the original).  Matril did what I had planned to do if Lendari gave it to me, randomed it between us.  I won.  Matril was heartbroken, I am feeling really bad about the whole deal.  Net---- NO ONE WINS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm giving Matril my iksar regen bp if he doesn't already have one.  Yes, probably not the most savvy move on my part, but I've never been the one to hoard up items or plat, I've got about 5k pp in my bank among ALL my chars.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone can take something from this experience.<br>

<br>
to the boys out there who insist on ripping this poor girl apart, and i know you have stressed the fact that you don't care what age/sex she is, you must understand what it can be like for a girl in this game.  you deal with all types of bullshit from being talked down to, to having people not take you seriously, to people not listening or being able to follow you as a leader because you're female, and you have your sexual harassers.  i have to deal with this everyday in rl being a part of a man's industry.  some guys in this game can be absolutely ruthless in their treatment.  some forget they are talking to females and you must realize that women do not see things the same way as men and sometimes when you say things or joke about things, it can be misunderstood.  i can't say i know all these incidents with this bad lendari, but i can assure you that things can get mighty stressful in everquest when you're a girl in a man's world.  i know i have been brought to tears before with some eq events and i feel stupid for it now, but i'm sensitive.  and speaking to my guy friends about these incidents, they of course didn't get why i was upset.  remember guys, this is a 14 year old girl....  i know that's not an excuse for all her &quot;bad&quot; behavior that is claimed here, but take that in to consideration.  she's probably just learning to work with other people and to be a leader.  her sense of humor and views on things are probably dramatically different than most people in this game.  i know that if anyone is actually reading this they're probably thinking it's a crock of shit, but i have to defend her as a female and the fact that she's young.  i can't imagine how she must be feeling right now reading all these negative things about herself.  she obviously has issues and her self-esteem must be in the shitter after reading this.<br>
<br>
in terms of druids rolling on fungi tunics, hmmmm, i've done king a million times and everytime i've been there, EVERYONE HAS ROLLED UNLESS A MONK THERE NEEDED ONE.  i can point the finger at all the enchanters, necros, magicians, warriors, paladins, rogues, clerics, rangers, sks, and whatever other class i've forgotten who have rolled on the thing too.  atleast a druid can f'ing wear the thing and let me tell you, when i had a manastone, this thing was amazing to have.  maybe you should have established the loot rules before you went down there huh?  i think it's ridiculous to say that every class can roll but druids :P.  i mean, i highly doubt many warriors that are high enough lvl to go to shrooms is going to wear the damn thing as their main tunic considering it's only 22ac and negative a lot of stats.  the way the situation has been presented, it sounds like someone is being a bit greedy and bitter about the whole thing.....  i'm not defending what happened, i'm defending a druid's right to roll with the rest of the group if that was the case.<br>
<br>
so what have i said?  be conscious of people's age and sex in this game, it can explain a lot.  and always remember there's a reason why people act the way they do, no one's naturally evil or a basketcase or whatever you want to call lendari.  she's a subject of her xp and environment.  we can't spend our lives using this as an excuse for behavior but i think people need to have a little understanding and empathy.  people seem to often forget in this game that we're all humans, treat her with some respect guys, she's a young girl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uqaldaliele666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qaldaliele 666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 8:10:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lendari</span><hr size=1> Wow Invic coming from someone with such a sterling history as yourself ?

I would really rather not bring all the details of Falon's problems with Lendari out into the open, mainly because Len's already getting enough embarrassment from what's been said. &nbsp;I don't think Lendari's a bad kid; she's just made dumb mistakes (some of which have made people very angry, and some of which have made people feel like shit). &nbsp;What I <i>will</i> say is that Falon ended up being on the shitty side of what Jaeden calls "the Lendari experience" at one point. &nbsp;I would have preferred her not to post on this thread at all, but I don't control her actions. &nbsp;She feels justified in posting, and given what I know (facts, not inferences derived from this thread or word of mouth), I've got no place to argue. &nbsp;All I can do is watch the thread and keep posts like yours from giving people the wrong idea about things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ustarcharmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starcharmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 8:24:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> DO not do that please</span><hr size=1> Do NOT use the &quot;because she is a young girl&quot; excuse.  <br>

I have no opinions on any of her actions, I was never there for any of them.  My RL best friend Syrra, had a problem with her about a certain thing, but she kept that to very very few people for about a year now.<br>
<br>
Women who play this game have enough stigmas attached already (invit's comment about how he thinks Lendari looks in RL).  This internet is finally somewhere there is an even playing field.  On everquest, female and male characters, have all the same &quot;stats&quot;, where skill and heart, is what makes you rise above the rest.  As a woman, I don't want to read that someone can do something, good or bad, BECAUSE she is female.  Young fine, both males and females, at that age can have a rather short fuse.  Teenage years are not an easy time for anyone to deal with emotions.  But DO NOT lower women in general, for the actions of one.<br>

  Ok Vishanti I just want to know how you know what I am, and what I am not thinking. I called Zhaolin childish for his choice of words at the time. If you look at the post in which I called him childish you will notice I addressed it to him.  Therefore what I said was ment for him, not anyone else, just him.  Now if I tell you this enough you might actual start to understand that.  <br>
<br>
   You then go on to post on how I have insulted many people on the server who have used the same words.  I will state it again since you don't seem to remember it,  I was addressing Zhaolin and Zhaolin only.  If you go back and read the post you will see the first two words are &quot;Ok Zhaolin&quot;.  I think this makes it pretty obvious who I am talking to.<br>
<br>
     You also mention how you are being sarcastic.  One point when you say    {Again, refer to the comment about &quot;people who use such language.&quot;  A large number of people have said, &quot;EAD,&quot; so are you calling each one of them childish?  No?  I didn't think so.}    I think it is safe to say you are being sarcastic.  However, you were able to actualy able to understand that when I called Zhaolin childish I was talking to him, even if it was for a brief second before you added the part &quot;I don't think so&quot;.  I was not adressing everyone else who has posted on this board and used the same words just him.  I was not adressing everyone who is associated with Falon, just the one person who told me to E.A.D. that is associated with her.  That person would be Zhaolin.<br>
