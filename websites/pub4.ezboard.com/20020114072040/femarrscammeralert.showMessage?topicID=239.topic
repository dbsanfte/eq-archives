I see his name up here. . I want to drive a nail into his coffin also. . <br>
<br>
He tried trading me cobalt legs for a PSC. .  yes, I thought it was funny too. . until he sounded serious. Then he says they are on his friends char. .  he wouldn't tell me the friends name. . so, I figure this is an attepmted scam, and play along a bit long. . hey, I am greedy, I could go for cobalt greaves if he is truthful, hehe. So anyway. . FINALLY, he tells me the name of his friend is Gunkonbut. . I think to myself ok. .  then I send a tell to Kudelce. . Gunkonbut's RL bro. .  hehe, and he tells me how Xxadus tried to scam Gunkonbut out of a Fungi. . offering Cobalt legs. . . so then I ever so nicely told him to go fuck himself (xxadus, not kudelce) <br>
<br>
So. . then a few days later I see a shout &quot;Xxadus give me my stuff back!&quot;  so I sigh, and shout my story. Then the next thing I know. . Xxadus  runs up to me. . with SLATE beating on him!! He stands there and let's slate get a look at me. . then runs to Nro to try and train slate on me. .  didn't work, not sure if it would have, but I hit /q before hand. So after Fisarik  and I shouted about him for awhile. . he called Fis an idiot (a grown up word!) and challenged him to a duel. . Fis at the time was 36, and Xxadus was 40. .  Fis beat the hell out of him, and wouldn't let any clerics rez him.  <br>
<br>
The next day. . .<br>
Xxadus tells me &quot;I am sorry, I was not trying to scam you or your friend or anything, Gunkonbut scammed me. And I was trying to get my Cobalt legs back. The GMs told me I would get them back, that's why I offered them to you&quot;<br>
<br>
That is what he said. .  a lame ass story like that. . so anyway. .  do yourselves a favor and just ignore this asshole. . <br>
<br>
and I STRONGLY encourage anyone with any self respect to leave the Drunken Pirates guild. . the 2 people I have met (Xxadus, and an ogre warrior, forget his name) were scammers. . .  When Fisarik and I were explaining Xxadus to the Ogre warrior in Pirates.  .he said &quot;What's wrong with scamming?&quot;<br>
I do NOT want to bad mouth a guild, but this is not very good. . .<br>

It was not scamming related more so of him being a dick. I was solo-ing treants in SK when he runs up and pulls one of the treants-- I was sitting right in front of them and he totally just snag them shits. so he grabs one and I &quot;KS&quot; the treant, he goes on saying, &quot;My bro is a GM on this server, you're going to be in deep shit when he finds out.&quot; I yell out to zone and tell them what's goin' down and they all tell me he could get in trouble for being on the same server as a sibling who is a GM. So blah blah blah, He tries to take another treant from me and I again &quot;KS&quot; it. <br>
<br>
Then he leaves, or so I thought, treants pop up again he tries to solo them and I let him try to solo them and low and behold, he gets his ass whooped. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But, anyways-- Could he possibly still be around because he does in fact have a GM that is his brother? If so, let's ban the fuck and kick his bro out of the GM biz. <p><br>Shnarf <br><i>"A Million bleeding hearts, composing prose in blood, to live and die a thousand times."<i><br>

So even if the guy did have a brother who was a GM, that GM couldn't really do shit to you unless you gave him a reason to. <br>
<br>
BTW, if you logged that conversation and /petitioned, he could have gotten in a good bit of trouble.  In fact, if you even gave him a tell and asked if it's true he has a brother who's a GM, then logged THAT conversation, he could still get in trouble.<br>

Meaning this GM could be thrown out of the program just for telling his brother he is a GM on this server.  Also, if you are a Guide on the same server as any friends/family's characters, even in-game friends, you are to ask for immediate reassignment.<br>

Do you t hink Xxadus REALLY uses the character "Xxadus" as his main? I really doubt it. I would imagine he has an alt (if not banned) that does have the stuff that his scammed items have bought him. Just my thoughts, I don't believe there is a chance in hell of him giving the gear back.<br>

Rogue of his is called DRACONAS so no thats not his friend thats him. He has a brother who is a 58 rogue or SK or something but dont know the name...unless thats him also. He does have more then one account also because his Xxadus account was suppose to be getting banned. I know all this because i knew him before he started scamming and one of my RL friends who got banned scammed him and got me in the middle of everything (long story). To avoid being scammed, dont let ANYONE use your gear unless you know them in RL or maybe if you known them since lvl 10. Thats what i do and i have not been scammed before so it works <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><img src=http://www.blizzard.com/images/war3/units/abomination-opt.gif></center><center><h2><u><b>Slazzer Spazzer<center></h2><u><b><center><u><b>53 Disciple<center><u><b>
