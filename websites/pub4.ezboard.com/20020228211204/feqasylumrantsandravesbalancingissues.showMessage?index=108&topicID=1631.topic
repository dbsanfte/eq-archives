I was pretty upset that they took the Verix spawn as I had camped his PH on several occasions without seeing a pop, and was pretty miffed that they wouldn't respect my camp.  <br>
<br>
As to the Jellah/Maxander thing, I believe I have explained myself.  it was quite a while ago and I may not have all the details perfectly correct, but I do remember being upset that I was only getting secondhand information from someone in my group instead of being able to actually talk to someone in Jellah's group.  As for why we were there so fast?  Well as I recall we had gone up to Observer camp and I was pulling as usual.  I usually pull down the ramp, keeping mobs inc always and slowed for the melees to chew through while I go get more.  So I get down to BK camp and the BK is up, I don't see their group anywhere.  I do remember now that I didn't do a camp check, I did a /who command to see if anyone from that group was in zone.  They weren't, so I figured they had finished and zoned out.  They were camping a significant distance down the hall from the BK camp, so I couldn't have possibly seen their dead bodies.  I was like, cool, BK for us!  And I pulled it, group killed it, we moved down.   <br>
<br>
In retrospect I suppose the folks from FL could have done the same thing, and during the 5 minutes my group was absent from the zone they might have just claimed the camp/verix pop.  If that was the case I can understand it a little more.  Doesn't make me much less aggravated tho, since I contacted them immediately once they were there and let them know I had been camping it.  At that point the cleric told me Givin was claiming to have been camping it for hours, an obvious lie.  This was all before they started killing the mobs that had repopped to get to Verix.  <br>
<br>
As for Malvenia, you really got yer panties in a wad over that incident and I wasn't able to placate you.  Which was frustrating to me, I wanted to resolve it but couldn't.  I guess &quot;You really disliked&quot; me at that point and further discussion was pointless.  Pity, I used to really like you too.  <br>
<br>
I was guilty in that incident of perhaps moving too fast on a camp and not doing enough checking.  Ok fine.  Your group blew it outta proportion from there, probably over exasperation at losing the named?  Big deal really, since he pops like 1 in 3 times and usually drops something crappy and stupid.  <br>
<br>
Again I apologize for blowing up at FL, although I still think Givin did a bad thing by steamrolling me.  I'm not happy with him or the folks who helped him.  <br>
<br>
As for the wiping on verix thing, what can I say?  I obviously suck and am a bad player.  For anyone who wants to camp him tho, I'd watch for adds on the pull if the area isn't broken when he pops.  Verix summons help I think, and he tends to wander around while summoning people with him into moats and such.  I've never seen a mob behave that strangely.  Just a warning for folks who attempt him.  <br>
<br>
P.S. the verix that popped after I logged was killed by my own guildies and MQed to me.  I guess karma was in my favor at that point?  And enough with the cheap cracks on Pengy eh?  He was the one who helped kill Verix and MQed it with me.  Whatever, I'm done discussing this.  <br>

<br>
You also wouldnt have seen our live bodies either then, we died at our pull spot. As for doing a /who all in the zone, our cleric was not out of zone for more than 30 seconds, she is a lucky fast zoner (unlike me), and btw you are aware that groups evac or zone out from time to time if in trouble. If you had done a camp check to make sure, you would have recieved a response that BK was indeed still camped.<br>
<br>
In the end, the misunderstanding was not the big deal, you made it clear to Max that your group was KEEPING the camp. That was the issue that made me upset. Once you realized all your assumptions were incorrect, you decided that since your group was there now you were STAYING. I guess by appeasing us you mean how you offered to drag our corpses, I guess we should have felt ok about you taking our camp then.<br>
<br>

<br>
Hmm we did? One group member talked to you, only one, you did not get tells from 6 different people cursing you to hell. We did not take it to public channels as you did with Givin. We did not curse your guild and call them names. We did not come start a rant about you or the incident. Yes Max and the rest of us were pissed off that you decided you were STAYING in a camp you knew dam well we were camping. BUT we left and did not stay and argue endlessly. <br>
<br>
I am done with this, I think Land has shown his true colors and maybe you even learned somthing. Possibly you wont be so quick to do what you did that day in BK, since you were so upset when you felt this was done to you, imagine how we felt..... then realize we didnt blow up even closely to the way you did. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigottomuchgameforyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>igottomuchgameforyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/5/02 1:36:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1631.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Givin, KSer with a rotten attitude.</span><hr size=1> Land you make yourself sound dumber everytime you try to argue with Jellah.

venrix is a rare random spawn.  And if you can wipe out to him you have no business even dreaming about vp.  This is some funny ass shit though, even though I would argue that he isnt an ffa mob, since its basically a rare not entirely special dungeon spawn with a ph in a camp that can easily be taken by 1 group or less if they actually have a chance at vp.<br>

Jesus, the time it took to read this "monkeys humping a football clusterfuck" topic, everyone on lanys could have the fucking Verix piece. Except pengy, as I paid for the multiquest rights to it from him.  <br>
<br>
Christ (second christian savior reference), do you really need to spend that much time posting how you dont suck and others do? Go back to masterbating in the dark closet of your sisters room and leave the rest of lanys alone landdragon.<br>
