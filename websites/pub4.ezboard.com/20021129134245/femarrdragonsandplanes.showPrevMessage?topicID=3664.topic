Of course I'm asking myself WTF when I look under the computer table and notice one of my cats gnawing on the main power cord, she chewed right through it.  (Although she looked kinda cute when it was hanging from her mouth, and she looked up at me with that innocent &quot;what?&quot; look on her face and those bright emerald green eyes ...)<br>
<br>
I immediately dive under the table grabbing for the cat and yelling some obscene language at it.  She scrams as fast as lightning into the next room, and in all my frustration and trying to seize the animal, I misjudge the distance between my head and the slide drawer where the keyboard goes.<br>
<br>
A packet of ice, a large bump, and a run to the nearest store where I can replace my power cord, I find my cat hiding under my bed, glaring at me, like it was all MY fault.  I try to act sweet, calling her name, and luring her out with food, but it fails.  Cat 1 Me 0.  She knows as soon as she steps paw out from under that bed she'll be tossed about the room like a rag doll.<br>
<br>
So, thinking I'll calm down a little, I relogg into EQ to find myself dead, and damnit, I forgot to get a bind anywhere near.  So after so desperately trying to find a port to get back to my corpse, I decide to try and lure my cat out from under the bed again.  I lift up the bed covers that lay on the ground to find her in the same exact spot, hasn't moved an inch.  I slowly reach for her when she darts out from under the bed and runs in circles trying to find a way out.  (I closed the door, mwahahaha.  What, you think I'm THAT stupid? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  However the sudden burst out from under the bed causes me to hit my head in the same exact spot as before /cry.<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion ... @#%$ you cat!  I hope you @#%$ die you worthless piece of @#%$ animal!  All you ever do is @#%$ claw and scratch and hiss and piss and moan.  I'll @#%$ strangle you next time you set foot in my room and even so much as breathe in the direction of my computer you rat bastard son of a bitch @#%$ animal!  (Feel free to help with the murder of my cat)<br>
<br>
Oh, and her name is Mia (pronounced Meea), so now you can add her to your no rez, no port, no buff, must train list.<br>
<br>
I hope you electricute yourself next time ... <p><center>

<br>
I love my cat. When I first got her I lived in the country, and she was a stray, we fed her turkey cause she appeared on thanksgiving right after supper. we took her in &quot;just for the night&quot; my mom said, and we ended up keeping her. She was afraid of crows, but she used to chase foxes across our yard if any came near to the house. She once went under my stepfather blanket on the couch, he farted, and after that day she never went near him again. She is deathly afraid of plastic bags (maybe the original owner stuck her in one and ditched her down a road nearby, she was a kitten when we got her) After a couple days with her, we named her Schitzo, cause she's freaking crazy.<br>
<br>
last spring I was a nervous wreck for days because one morning she was real tired. she laid around not moving, and once or twice tried to move from bed to couch but couldn't get the energy to jump the short distance onto the cushions. one day she got up and tried to walk upstairs, but had to stop after 2 stairs and slump down, looking back at me pleadingly till I carried her upstairs where she slowly walked into a dark closet and laid down in the corner. She could barely lift her head, just laid there staring. I finally, on a sunday evening, called an emergency vet number and managed to stay up all night keeping an eye on her till the nearest vet office opened. 3 nights she was at the vet, having tests done, and being fed intravenously(sp?) and when all was said and done it cost me about $400. Never once have I regretted it.<br>
<br>
My cat can get away with whatever the heck she wants, and although I might get angry when she playfully bites my when playing on the couch, or digs her claws into me and draws blood, it's gone in a flash. I hope she's around for many more years, I dunno what I'll do when she's gone.<br>
<br>
Is it YOUR cat or a family members cat? cats are just dumb animals(well, no, they're smart, but not smart enough to know not to chew on power cables) just suck up the $4 and be happy it didn't electrocute itself.<br>
<br>
some people might think $400 is a lot to pay for JUST a cat, but dammit it's so worth it. Every time I play EQ she comes over, at some point, to stand on her hind legs, 1 paw on the arm of my chair, other paw stretched out occasionally to pat my arm until I turn and look at her, at which point she meows to let me know she wants a pet. couple seconds of petting and she runs off to go explore the house or go back to bed. It's so worth it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Mitsi is a siamese-looking-mutt, 19!!! years old. I will do anything, pay anything, to make sure the remaining time she has with me is as happy and healthy as possible for her. And I do fork out quite a bit to make sure her hyperthyroidism is stable and she eats well, including buying her baby food because her teeth bother her sometimes. Totally devoted to me, nonetheless she has a cat's grace and poise.<br>
<br>
Metoo is a mutt, but comes from 2 purebred parents (siamese and persian- he's got the persian look without the smooshed face). He's only 5 years, but you'd think he was still 5 months. Acts more like a dog than a cat...'barks' at noises, literally throws himself on the ground in front of you for you to rub his tummy, has all the grace god gave a cow, and absolutely no sense. However, there is no more loving animal on this earth. He loves you, and he doesn't even know you. But trust me, he still loves you, and if you ever meet him he'll make sure to let you know how much he's always, always loved you. And he knows you love him, too. *chuckle*<br>
<br>
I love them both, but you can imagine which one does the things that make you just want to scream and kill. Poor Metoo, my little dumbass dingbat.<br>
<br>
I really feel for ya, but you gotta realize your cat probably had NO idea chewing on the cord was a Bad Thing. It might, now, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I have had cats all my life and chewing on cords was a problem with a few of them...however I have discovered a solution.<br>
<br>
A friend suggested I try a product called &quot;Bitter Apple&quot;.  It comes in a small tube (like toothpaste) and is the extract of green apples.  It's natural and non-toxic...but utterly unpleasant.  The cat I currently own is the devil, she chews on humans for fun and loves to put her claws into just about anything.  When she was a kitten, I coated most of my important wiring with bitter apple.  After a few weeks (which included running around shaking her head in disgust...lol) she discontinued chewing on wires and has not done so since...that was almost 5 years ago.<br>
<br>
I recommend you pick some up and give it a shot. <p><center><img src=http://members.rogers.com/hazard/taelensig1.jpg

The first was a kitten that the wife insisted on brining home. The second was one we rescued from the animal shelter. <br>
<br>
In this city the police pick up all black colored strays<br>
around Halloween because of the sick fooks that like to<br>
torment and kill black furred animals. But that means<br>
that alot of poor cats lose their happy homes because<br>
their family cannot find them.<br>
<br>
My cats attitudes can be sumarized simply:<br>
'If you dont like what I do, open the damn door, and let me out @#%$'<br>
<br>
I must say that I wish I could do that. But the sad fact is that cats are low on the food chain. Cars, dogs and poison will kill them.<br>
So from their point of view, they are in jail, and they dont like it.<br>
<br>
But cats grow on you. After a while you cant see how you ever lived w/o one. And they do keep the other pests away. Mice, insects and even rats.<br>
<br>
They are also the most savage little bastards I have ever<br>
watched. I am very glad that they dont grow much past<br>
20 pounds. <br>

Ghie and I love them.  We have had more then a few.<br>
<br>
Saxon....much to smart cat that would open the refigerator door and eat anything he could find.<br>
<br>
Danae...Ocicat she would sit on the table I would place the clean dishes on and casually push them off with a paw while the other cats sat around the kitchen and watched.<br>
<br>
Talun...Abysinnian he figured out what toilets were for....no sh1t...he would get up there and use it to pee.  No we didn't use one those teach your cats to use the toilet kits.  He just figured it out I figured out it was him cause I caught him doing it.<br>
<br>
Scruff...Found him in a park with a broken dead tail rescued him he loves everyone.  He sleeps with someone everynight.  He doesn't care if you don't love him he knows he will bring you around someday.  He just returned from a visit to my mothers she had seen a mouse.  He caught 2 mice and was treated like a prince while he was there for doing it.<br>
<br>
My cats haven't ever chewed a power cable of any kind though.  They sleep on top of our moniters and watch us use the computers.   <p>

He's got NONE of the traditional markings, being a ginger tortiseshell, but he's got the ears and, dear god, the tail.  Very pronounced 'flame' pattern on his face.<br>
<br>
  And he's utterly, utterly insane.  He's been nicknamed Beeboobee by my flatmates because that's the noise he makes instead of meowing.  I got him when some friends of mine found him abandonded on the side of the road, dehydrated and shaking, when he was about 4 weeks old.  They knew I was looking for a kitten, brought him over to me before they took him to the SPCA, and I took one look at him peeking out from the blanket and that was that : ).<br>
<br>
  He's either highly intelligent, or highly stupid.  We've not worked it out yet.  Before we had him neutered, he had a disconcerting habit of humping peoples arms... most annoying when playing on the PS2 : ).  He's sleek, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> affectionate, and scared of nothing and no one... he's been picking fights with the other cat in the flat since he was... well, about 6 weeks old.  Other cat is about 7 years older...<br>

The other is named Lucifer (trust me, he's lived up to his name).  However I went to the store and got this spray that is supposed to keep pets off the furniture, off counters, to stop chewing on things and such, (thanks for the advice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) however this cat of mine is either highly intelligent and has somehow figured out a way to outsmart me or is not the brightest crayon in the box.  She continues to chew on these darn cords, even if I close the door she somehow manages to get in.<br>
<br>
She's going to electricute herself one of these days and it's getting rather expensive to keep replacing all the parts that have been chewed in half.  I've never had this problem with any of my cats including her before, but for some reason she has takin' a liking to these tasty power cords.<br>
<br>
Not to mention I'm really careful about what my cats do, and try to prevent them from doing things that could hurt them, although we all know cats do what they want when they want regardless of what we think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I once had this cat named Bandy.  I was preparing to go grocery shopping and was in the parking lot trying to find a space.  The person in front of me opened the door and dropped this little bundle of black fur out onto the pavement and drove off.  Of course I slam on my breaks, open the door, and grab the kitten before she got run over.  Needless to say she was the BEST cat I've ever owned, totally amazing.  Well, she rather liked the doggy door I had for my dogs at the time and liked to go outside.  I tried to keep her in since I didn't like her running loose, but sometimes it was inevitable.  She would ALWAYS come back though.  Well, one thing led to another and she had 4 kittens.  Pouncer, Lucky, Bandit, and Fritz.<br>
<br>
I had them all for about a year more when the grouchy OLD fucks next door that hated every living thing on the planet decided to plant some antifreeze out in their yard.  A lot of the cats in the neighborhood that got outside were getting sick, and one of them happened to be my Bandy.  I noticed she came in staggering, and had trouble standing up, so I fixed up a bed for her in a box with some fluffy towels.  Soon after she started having convulsions and her little eyes would roll into the back of her head and she'd start foaming at the mouth, like having a seizure.  There were absolutely no animal clinics open at the time, no one that provided a 24 hour service, since it was a smaller town I was living in at the time.  I had no one to call to help me, and my car was in the shop for a couple repairs at the time too, figures something bad would happen at the most inconvenient time.<br>
<br>
To make a long story short, I stayed up all night with my cat, painfully watching her convulse every now and then, wheeze while she tried to breath.  I've never felt more useless in my whole life.  Even one of her kittens, Pouncer, jumped into the box at one point and laid there with her for a good 2 hours, half the time with a paw on her, almost seeming like he was trying to comfort his mother.  I still get tears in my eyes thinking about it.<br>
<br>
In the morning she was still alive, and as soon as a vet office opened I called a friend to have them rush me there.  However there was nothing they could do, she was too far along, and I also later found out that even if I had brought her in at the time I noticed the symptoms, there would have only been a 30% chance of her living then because she was even then far into the poisoning.  She was barely breathing after they did a few tests and drew some blood.  She was suffering, you could see it in her eyes, so as unbearable it was for me to do it, I told them to put her down.  I got to spend a few minutes with her before they did so, and I've never cried so hard in my life.  But the thing that makes it a true memory I will never forget, is that when I was talking to her, she actually opened her eyes all the way and reached for me with her paw.  The look she gave me was almost human.  It was a look of loss and love combined, but it was like she was letting me know that everything would be okay.  It resembles the time when I had my VERY first cat, who died of cancer.  Right after that cat died, Whiskers, out of no where I found this book in my house called, &quot;The Cat from Heaven&quot;.  Out of no where it was there, which I still cannot explain it to this day.<br>
<br>
Well, she was put down, and that was the end of that.  But what's really heartbreaking, was one day when I was out, I put her 3 kittens (the only little female, Fritz, I gave to my best friend because she was looking for a cat) into a room because I had company over and they were allergic to them.  Well this room happened to face the place that housed that godforsaken couple who hated everything in existance, surprised they didn't kill each other.  Everyone knew it was them responsible for the poisoning that was going around.  they were the ONLY people who did not have a cat or dog and pans of liquid were seen lying around in their yard, however when the authorities were called, all the evidence was cleared away.  Not to mention they always threw clumps of mud and etc at my 3 dogs and were always looking over my 10foot wood private fence.  They even intentionally intimidated my dogs to bark all the time so they could call the police or humane society to get them taken away.  When I spoke to an officer about it once who visited, she even said herself that when she pulled up and got out of the car, they barked for the first 30 seconds or so, then saw that no harm was being done so shut up and went on their way, and they NEVER barked otherwise.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I got a little offtopic but these people threw a rock in my window, and my 3 other kittens crawled out.  Seriously, how much evidence do you need when you have a giant rock laying in the middle of the room, with part of the window shattered, and the direction that it was thrown from was directly in the middle of those people's property.  Nonetheless it is safe to say that they will go to hell, and I'll gladly send them there given the chance.<br>
<br>
So maybe this is an addition to the rant I had in the beginning.  But any other information on how I can keep my cat from chewing on these cords would be a HUGE help.<br>

Your cat is bored and she's playing. What you're doing is stopping her from playing but your fixing the symptom not the cause. It's like punishing a hungry kid for trying to eat food.<br>
<br>
Don't stop her from playing with the cords because soon enough she'll get bored. Instead try to find her something else to play with, a ball on a string, one of those cat climbing posts if you don't already have them.<br>
<br>
If she continues go and buy a cable tidy. Will cost less then one power cable for twenty metres of the stuff. It's a tube of corregated plastic that fits round one or more cables and it'll stop her biting anything dangerous.<br>
<br>
I've had cats for years. Currently I have two a male tabby called Growlithe, ( after the Pokemon ) and a tortoiseshell female kitten by the name of Fleece ( from the game Summoner ). Fleece has taken to in no particular order, nuzzling up against the warm monitor at the back, chewing the modem cord, turning up the volume on my hi-fi, standing 2 inches in front of the screem or TV, hiding on top of the fridge so she has a head start when we open it, ragging the laundry basket, finding her way behind the TV unit so she can sit on the warm video recorder, climbing the curtains, throwing cat litter all over the floor and so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
My previous cat Moley ( she looked like a mole damnit ) had an annoying habit as a kitten of lying on my chest when I was waking up, then whenever I yawned she would stick her paw in my mouth to catch my tongue. Not good when you consider she was using the litter tray at the time. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.plattsflello.com/ryn.gif" BORDER=0></A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughiastormwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghia Stormwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/1/02 7:03:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3684.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kittens!</span><hr size=1> You have to be careful what you name cats.

My friend Emily named her new little kitten Ophelia.  That was the most insane cat I have ever seen.  She climbed to the top of the telephone pole and would sit at the very top of it.  She was often seen sitting at the highest gable on thier 2 story house.  I warned her when she said she wanted to name it Ophelia not to do it. <p>

<br>
1.  Mercedes - 17 year old female cat, long hair, black with white markings, very small.  We only see her about once a day when she gets hungry.  Then around the 5th of every month, she decides to come inside and stay a few days.  Then off on the prowl again.<br>
<br>
2.  Spot - male.  Tuxedo cat, smallish build, long-hair. has a white spot right in between his eyes.  Likes to walk out in front of me pulling into the driveway and sit down.  Tried that with my father in law and got his hip pulled out of socket.  Doesn't do that so much anymore.<br>
<br>
3.  Toonces - male, slender lithe build short-hair.  Looks exactly like that cat from the SNL skit.  Very nervous cat, actually had acne one time.  Ever had the vet tell you that your cat has acne?<br>
<br>
4.  PeeWee T - male, brown white and black stripes with white boots and nose, short-hair, very strong muscular build.  The T stands for temporary, we were going to get him well and take him to the vet to give away - that was 11 years ago.  He was a runt.  Now he's the sveldt 16 pound jock cat of the bunch.  He's also the dead bird/squirrel provider of the bunch.<br>
<br>
4 3/4.  Dr. Mac - male, long-hair tuxedo cat, very long and wiry build.  We named him after the vet, Dr. McIntyre.  Why you ask?  As a kitten he was run over and his left back leg was broken.  2 weeks later he ran out into the street (cast in tow) and managed to get the same leg run over and essentially crushed.  Dr. McIntyre decided the only way to save him was to take the leg off at the hip.  He has compensated for his lost wheel by growing the most magnificent tail you've ever seen.  I catch him &quot;scratching&quot; his head with his nub daily.  Cat's not all that bright anymore though, he walks into the house and you can just see him thinking, &quot;have I been in this room before?&quot;<br>
<br>
5 3/4.  Nolan - male, short-hair, white with one grey spot on his head and a spot around one eye, typical build.  We found him when he was a day old, his mother had abandoned him.  All the screeching he had done impaired his ability to meow, he just squeaks now.  This cat thinks he is a human child.  We named him Nolan after Nolan Ryan.  We had one of those old school TVs built into a cabinet (you know, 19&quot; TV built into a 400lb. cabinet) and we were watching a Texas Rangers game.  The cat ran up to the screen and started trying to claw at all of Nolan Ryan's pitches.  He's never looked at the TV since (incidently Nolan pitched his final no-hitter that night).<br>
<br>
6 3/4.  Skeeter - male, brown and black long-hair.  We named him Skeeter due to an unfortunate incident.  He arrived in our back yard during a barbacue.  Scared witless of the dogs, he scrambled up onto a table and dumped his tail directly in to a citronella candle.  When we calmed him down and got the wax off, he looked like a tiger striped possum.  He has since grown back his tail and its friggin huge.<br>
<br>
7 3/4.  Simon - male. 19lb orange and white tabby.  A builder I used to do business with was working out of a temporary office (read trailer) and had gotten this cat as an office pet.  He had had his front claws removed.  When he had finished building his new office, he was going to simply leave the cat at the trailer to fend for itself.  We brought Simon home and no longer do business with that particular builder.  This is the fattest damned cat I have ever seen.  He's a sweetheart to people but a complete ass to all the other cats, unfortunately, they have stickers and he doesn't so he tends to get beat up a lot.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there are my cat stories.  Don't even get me started on the dogs.<br>
