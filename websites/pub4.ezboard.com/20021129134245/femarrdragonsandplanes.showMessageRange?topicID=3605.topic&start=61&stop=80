<br>
I guess the point I was trying to make was that is is a mistake is to associate 1 vote = 1 value when looking at presidential elections.  Presidential electors (the people who actually vote for the president) are appointed by states <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In 48 states, the legislature has people vote for a slate of electors pledged to a candidate, and the slate that gets the most votes is appointed (which is how the candidate gets all the electoral votes from that state).  In Maine and Nebraska, the statewide winner gets 2 electoral votes, and the winner of each congressional district in the state gets one.<br>
<br>
This is probably boring you to death, but I just wanted to show that presidential elections are not meant to necessarily reflect the majority choice of the country as a whole, but instead reflect the individual majorities of the states.<br>

the american values and ideals, to me, are the right way to live. stoning women to death for having a child out of wedlock, is WRONG. i don't care how to try to justify it.(i'm referring to the muslim section of nigeria africa who ruled to stone a woman to death for giving birth to a child out of wedlock, soon as the child is weened, she will die by stoning.)<br>
<br>
the way they treat women there is appaling. the way they treat people in general is appaling. i hate china too if that makes you feel better.<br>
<br>
i have nothing against chinese people who live over here, they are obviously here to get away from that. same with muslim americans.<br>

In a lot of ways, I'm sure Christian missionaries had the same ideas when preaching the good word to the savages.<br>

Saddam being overthrown? I'm sure it'll happen. An American-style government? In an Arab country? Stranger things have happened, but I'm positive the sun will rise in the west and rivers run uphill before the Arabs assume an American-style government.<br>

Nope. Nowhere in their did I say Britain was better....gimme a minute....nope, read it again, it's definately not there.<br>
<br>
What I did was made a comparison. It may not come as a surprise to you but I don't really know all that much about the American presidential electoral process.<br>
<br>
I watched every episode of 24 and at the beginning it says &quot;The following takes place between the hours of 3pm and 4pm on the day of the Californian Presidential Primary&quot; and I'm thinking &quot;Great show, wonder what will happen next, what the fu&lt;I&gt;&lt;/i&gt;ck is a primary?&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I learnt that it doesn't matter how many votes you get, you can get twice as many as the next guy and still not win if you win more states. In my comparision each state is a certain hole. <br>
<br>
I made no comment on my opinions regarding this. If I were to do so I would probably have to consider the fact that certain peoples votes are worth more then another persons vote. Because if they come from a state with smaller numbers then 10,000 votes can be worth more then 100,000 votes in another state. Thats probably wrong.<br>
<br>
But on the other hand if it were the other way around, any candidate who was favoured by people living in....ooh...New York, they would win a massive number of votes whilst the residents of other places got almost no say at all.<br>
<br>
So I can express opinions for and against the system and I have no real preference so I'm going to stay out of the argument and just absorb. Which is what I was doing before someone tried to infer meanings from my post that werent there. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
The people that designed the 'Electoral College' were afraid that<br>
a HUGE state like New York (population wise) would be able to totally<br>
dominate a 'small' state like Conneticut.<br>
<br>
Thus you see small states jerking the entire country's chain.<br>
<br>
In a REAL sence, it really is more oligarcy than rebublic. In my home state<br>
(North Dakota) all elections are decided at least a year in advance.<br>
The parties meet, decide who will win, and then decide who will be the<br>
'sacrificial candidate' to run against them. The people of the state DO know<br>
that this is how it really happens, but it doenst seem to bother them.<br>
<br>
North Dakota has the smallest electorate of all the states.<br>
<br>
I have no reason to think that the same system doesnt play out in other states.<br>

simply boggles the mind. I sure as hell would NOT fight for any country where I did<br>
not get a vote.<br>

It's not how many swings you take, its how many holes you win. If I hear it right, Bush won more holes but finished about 40 over par? Whilst Gore won less holes but scored a good couple of birdies? </font><br>

Holy @#%$ that is a good analogy from someone that only knows about the American electoral college from this thread.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now I learnt that it doesn't matter how many votes you get, you can get twice as many as the next guy and still not win if you win more states. In my comparision each state is a certain hole. <br>
<br>
I made no comment on my opinions regarding this. If I were to do so I would probably have to consider the fact that certain peoples votes are worth more then another persons vote. Because if they come from a state with smaller numbers then 10,000 votes can be worth more then 100,000 votes in another state. Thats probably wrong.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Well, this is sort of correct. States with higher populations are worth more electoral votes than states with smaller populations. California is worth 55 votes, but Alaska is only worth 3, for example. But no state will ever have less than 3 (electoral votes = # of senators + # of congressional representatives), so tiny states have more voting power per person than large states.<br>
<br>
This seems unfair, but the winner-take-all aspect of winning each state balances this out. In a close election the value of a person's vote in a large state like California soars (because small changes in voting affect the chance to win a whopping 55 electoral votes). A close election in Alaska won't be so hotly contested, because only 3 electoral votes are at stake.<br>

This isn't a rant! This isn't a flame! This is a political discussion!!<br>
<br>
And on a lighter note.. ahem *cough*<br>
<br>
Chiteng said-<br>
<br>
They dont care how many <br>
people would die. They feel that those people dont support the USA so they dont count. <br>
<br>
What the @#%$ hell?? You know why I fear, loathe, discriminate against people in the middle east? <br>
<br>
It sure as hell isn't because they don't think like me. It's because I'm afraid they are going to run after my ass screaming holy Jihad with bombs tied around their waist!! And you said that your friends don't care about how many of them would die? How horrible! Oh Lord, people are going to die! We must do something else, remain peaceful at all costs! And let's hope another SEP. 11 DOESN'T HAPPEN! Sacrifice the few to save the many, how many more innocents need to die? However many it takes to free the world of tyrants who wield nuclear and chemical power like a kid who's found his dad's gun<br>
<br>
If I got a killer job offer to make hundreds of thousands of dollars working in Iran/Iraq/or even Sudan. I would turn it down without a second thought! Why? Not because I fear the Americans might kill me, it's because I'm afraid I'll get dragged out of my home, beaten to death, dragged around town square like the American pig I am while everyone is cheering at my demise! <br>
<br>
Go live a life over there Chiteng! See if they say, welcome to the middle east! And treat you to like a friend. <br>
<br>
And Ulu, why is it that the US is hated so much in the Middle East? I'd like to hear all of your thoughts on that matter. <p><img src="http://moongaden.homestead.com/files/elnots.jpg

Many of you voted for your senators, some didn't but as a whole you chose the people who now make the laws and govern America. The Arab nations did not elect your presidents nor were they allowed to vote and they feel the American government has sod all right whatsoever to dictate the laws they should live by.

Hospitality is a serious Arabic custom and one of the tenets of Islam. <br>
<br>
Why some Middle Eastern countries don't like the US? Quite a few reasons. Interference in domestic policy, including propping up of governments or regimes (Shah of Iran, pre-Gulf War Iraq, anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan to name a few).<br>
<br>
Implicit alliance with the State of Israel automatically puts a few Arab and their Islamic cousins in a bad mood. America's involvement in the Balfour Declaration didn't help matters either.<br>
<br>
And realpolitik. The UN backed liberation of Kuwait had zero to do with Kuwaiti welfare or sovereignty. It was oil. We all know that. So do the Arabs. The knowledge that they have fairweather friends around the world all based on oil production is real conducive to long-term friendliness, I'm sure.<br>
<br>
It's not just America. Britain, historically, had a far bigger role as meddlers and map re-drawers in this region. The Suez Canal, The Trucial States, Egypt, Balfour, T.E Lawrence, to name a few. <br>
<br>
But, in the present day, it's the US who is seen as the ones who want to play neo-colonialism and kingmaking.<br>

<br>
i've always agreed with you in the past, and still do.  but be careful, your last post almost has you sounding like Ulujain.<br>
<br>
the history of almost ALL hemispheres/countries is full of nations imposing, or attempting to impose, something on others.  from attila to mao to japan in wwII.  it just so happens to be &quot;the west&quot; now because they are in a position to do so.  <br>
<br>
ok, the rest is for everyone else, <br>
<br>
my previous post dismissed the u.n. as a vehicle for world peace.  let me clarify.  in its present form, it is an exercise in political masterbation.  for others it is a diversion.<br>
<br>
i dont think we as a global society are mature enough for a 'world government'.  by all means we need it.   but it's not going to happen anytime soon.  religion, greed, and many other factors will not quickly relinquish their power.<br>
<br>
our ancestors first had to get used to giving up their autonomy to form clans then villages, then city-states, etc...<br>
so it's not &quot;those damn americans&quot; standing in the way of a new world order.  grow up and realize the same racism, hatred, injustice, and hypocrisy you are quick to slam in the u.s. can also be found in almost every freaking civilization that ever existed.   we're not any different or better than any other subculture of humanity.  <br>
<br>
will it happen? yep.  contrary to the alarmists, we will not destroy mother earth and we will not kill off each other.  in my mind, it's just a matter of when we mature enough as a society to think globally.  sorry for that cliche, but i did use it in its truest sense.<br>
<br>
yes we have assholes of all political leanings who promote hatred and intolerance.  but think of where the hell we (and i can only speak for america) are today.   the tolerance of the MAJORITY of america accepts interracial relationships, alternative lifestyles, political beliefs, and religions that in the 1950s would have called for a House Un-American committee.<br>
<br>
people slam the u.s. for the internment of japanese in wwII.  and rightly so.  that was an important growing pain that needs to be remembered...especially now.  i dont mean that i'm glad that it happened, just that we learned from it.<br>
(those who chose to learn)<br>
<br>
think of the gays, socialists, arab/mexican/african/xxxx-americans at the different levels of american politics.  hell, we still have a long way to go.  but damn have we come a long way.<br>
<br>
absu, i got the impression you were british.  so, how can you stomach the house of lords, the monarchy?  how many non-white members of the house of lords, or even of the commons have there been?  maybe you have had a few....but have you had many?  maybe i'm wrong and you have had a lot.  my point is i will not tell you america is better than your country.....dont try to tell me yours is better than mine.<br>
<br>
you know what?  i think those things are silly, but i dont think that makes britain/england racist or elitist.  what it stands for NOW, is what i admire.  that it has a history of  explotation (as well as good things)... is besides the point.<br>
<br>
so yes absu, you pose an interesting question, it just strikes me as a self-serving one.<br>
