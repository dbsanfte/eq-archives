 The History of The Irda<br>
<br>
&quot; In the ancient days before they grew self centered and seduced by evil, the most beautiful of all races ever created by the gods was the Ogre.&quot; * (Dragonlance, Love and War, tales Vol. 3, p. 314)<br>
<br>
It was in the age when the Ogre were known as the Irda, the chosen of the gods. Made in the image of the gods, the Irda were the masters of the land. Each Irda was beautiful, and blessed with magical powers that neared a god-like awe from the other races of Norrath. As a result of this, the Irda had turned their backs upon the rest of the world, and all of its inhabitants. the gods seeing their creations compare themselves to gods, had grown angry with the Irda. It was decided by the gods, that all the Irda held dear would be taken from them, their beauty, their magic, and their special relationship they shared witht he gods. the Irda were blighted with mishapen forms, gone were the tall, fine boned forms they held so dear, to be replaced by a hideous husk that would serve as a constant reminder of all they had taken for granted. * (The Irda were even more beautiful than the finest of the high elves, their beauty drew races from what was normally considered beautiful by their race. i.e., a dwarven male would find whiskers amongst their women attractive, however that would still not matter, as the Irda were godlike in their form.) No longer were they looked upon as the chosen ones, now they were scorned by all other races, they had become Ogres. (The ogre form in general is very offensive to other races, thus they were spurned.)<br>

<br>
In time, the Ogres, as they were now called had become resentful, and malicious towards their former gods,  the other races, and even amongst themselves. the race , as a whole had begun to splinter off into smaller forces,each side fighting for their own warped sense of beliefs.<br>
<br>
  The darker gods of norrath sensing oppurtunity began whispering seductive tales of revenge, hatred and forbidden, to replace what was lost to them. At the head of this movement was Rallos Zek. In time the ogres learned to embrace these dark lords, and the ogres became a race bent on conquest. Rallos Zek had succeeded in gathering the warring tribes into one large holding, the city of Ogguk. There were many who still clung to their tribal ways, amongst them was the kingdom of Winterheim.(Dragonlance, Icewall Trilogy)<br>
Through their (citizens of Ogguk, and surrounding cities) of the dark lords, the Ogres had earned new rewards, for those lost as the Irda. By following Zek's teachings, the Ogres had eliminated the weaker members of their clans,others were granted arcane powers from their gods, while others were even granted the forbidden art of Necromancy. With the help of the Warlord, and his minions, the Ogres sought to claim what was once rightfully theirs, from what they considered the weaker , inferior races.<br>
<br>
p.525 EQ Atlas<br>
<br>
  The Ogre conquest was brutal for the most part a very unbalanced war, as Rallos Zek himself headed his army.<br>
<br>
 Even as war was waged upon mortals by the mighty Ogres, another quest was made by their gods, and their chosen heroes; a war was waged within the planes of the gods. The gods of good had rallied to fight Zek and his gathering armies. The army of Zek was beaten back, and judgement was rendered once again upon the Ogres.<br>
<br>
p. 525 Eq Atlas<br>
<br>
The greater gods turned back Rallos' army and then took vengeance on him by cursing his creatures. The Ogres were struck with weak minds,unable to think and reason as they once had, while the Giants were largely killed or dispersed.<br>
<br>
p. 535 Eq Atlas<br>
<br>
Planar scholars claim the Vegorogs were once Ogre soildiers that were led by their hero Murdunk during the Ogre invasion of the Plane Of Earth.<br>
<br>
p. 325 EQ Atlas<br>
   The city of Oggok was built shortly before Murdunk's tragic fall in Lake Rathe Tear and the defeat of Zek's primal empire upon Norrath. The original founders of the city were not directly affected by the curse imposed upon Zek's mortal creations. However, the first-born children of these settlers showed signs of the horrible curse. Generations passed, and the last of the &quot;pure &quot; Ogres faded out of memory.<br>
<br>
<br>
   Other Ogre cities also met their demise, the gods wrath spared no Ogre city. The city of Bloten was taken in a mighty earthquake, Winterheim was buried beneath the ice and snow, Ogguk's residents had been blighted. Yet, there were those that had escaped the gods wrath, through trickery of their own gods. One such place was the temples of the dark gods. Here, the darkest servants were protected from the downfall of their race.<br>
