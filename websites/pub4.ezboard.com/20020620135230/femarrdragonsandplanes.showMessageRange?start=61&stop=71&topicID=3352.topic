<br>
This coming from the same imbecile who is renowned on this board for his constant (inanely wrong and ignorant)necromancer whines? I can fully understand compassion towards anything; be it something as trivial as a video game, or as imperative as the safety of our children, but every single one of your 'rants' (and I use the term loosely) is nothing but a crybaby attention fit, hoping (I guess) to somehow vindicate your lack of skill at Everquest, and life in general.<br>
<br>
Since I've seen nothing but classy posts, and well thought ideas from Parum, I'd say you have a far bigger hill to climb than he does, seeing as your viewed as nothing much more than a whiner.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  (in regards to the white bureacrat comment)That's a racist comment. First off, I doubt you know the race of all the legislators who pass laws in your area. Secondly, their race is not a factor here. Throwing that into your statement shows a fair share of immaturity. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
While I have to agree that he worded it incorrectly, and put far too much emphasis on their alleged race, it was a speck in the face of his entire point. I refer to them as close minded, or sometimes yuppie, but the fact is this 'stereoyped' mindset of &quot;do what I say when I say I'm right because I pay taxes and am older than you&quot; mentality is governed by this elitist form within todays societal standards. He calls them white bureacrates, I call them yuppies, you call them honey, but in the end, their race isn't the factor.<br>
<br>
Also, racism has nothing to do with maturity. Unless you lead the argument that maturity leads to wisdom. I happen to think life leads to wisdom, and maturity co-exists within it, not neccesarily because of it. So him being racist (if he was) would be ignorant, not immature. Children don't grow up to become non racist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  (in regards to the &quot;I'm more mature than you paragraph&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Way to shift the entire point, again Einstein.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  (Wheel chair thing) That statement RIGHT there is the only reason I posted in reponse to your whining. I'd love for you to post an explanation for the wheelchair remark.

This one is what (ironically) got me to post too. Where in the FRICKING HELL did he make any negative comment towards people bound in wheel chairs.

Ahh, yes, now this one shows just how mature you are! You better not say something I don't like or I'll knock your teeth out. I'd hate to see what happens to any (if any) of your children whenever they do something you find highly morally constricting. Not only are you going to have a hellacious dental bill, but your children are going to realize how fvcked they are to have you for a father. <br>
<br>
You seem to think racism is immature, but it's funny, because you CAN grow out of beating up people. Learn to grow up before you criticize an obviously mature sixteen(ish) year old.<br>
<br>
As for Parum, hey man, that was me playing the enchanter in the Fungi camp a long time ago, when our tank went LD, and we had the 3 Chealing mushrooms. Hi =)<br>
<br>
As for Chiteng...anyone that doesn't appreciate a 1968 Shelby Cobra doesn't deserve anywhere near the car, much less to have sex with/in/near it. It is a verifiable chick magnet, by the way.<br>

I think he's both and you're almost in the same boat.

I too meant what I said.  I even told him it was good he was doing well.  My statement was brief because I didn't want to get into details and because I dont come here to talk of my accomplishments.  Since you are apparently interested, I'll digress for a sec.  I've had a job since I was 13 years old.  I was a gifted and honors student from elementary school till I left high school.  While I was in high school, not only did I maintain an exceptionally nice high school record but also took college courses during my junior and senior years.  I competed in academic decathalons (medaled in a few subjects), Chembowl (held at Huntington College in Alabama where we took second place in the southeast division of the United States), as well as numerous lesser competitions.  My ACT scores won me a full Presidential Scholarship to the University of South Alabama in their wonderful Pre-med program. I took a break from school after high school (joined the United States Marine Corps), then attended the university. I was halfway through my sophomore year when I started due to the classes I had taken through school.  My first year in college, my chemistry professor had me tutoring people in junior and senior courses.  I found I had an affinity for computers and changed majors to CIS where (my first year in that program) my programming professor had me tutoring others.  All this time I kept an active social life and enjoyed myself.  Through my last years of college, I actually worked 2 full time jobs and stayed a full time student (while doing exceptionally well).  I'm STILL doing very well in life ( I can go into details of that as well, but I dont feel like wasteing my time unless you really feel the need to know). I'll say AGAIN, most of us have jobs and went to school.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This one is what (ironically) got me to post too.

How about &quot;wheelchair bound pedophile&quot;.  That is propagating a stereotype.. a VERY BAD inaccurate and negative one.  Right up there with saying a car thieving nigger or a scamming Jew or any other kind of FVCKED up prejudice.  It's not him elevating ideas above my grasp of reasoning, it's him being too fvcking dumb and immature to elevate his ideas beyond judging others by appearance.  Apparently you're once again in the same boat as him.  It appears to me that you BOTH have a lot of growing up to do.  People who share your views on things like that are what is keeping our world a miserable place to live for so many.  As far as being personally humbled, you should be after opening your mouth on this one.<br>

I've lost some VERY DEAR loved ones that were wheelchair bound.  How many diabled friends have you really taken the time to get to know?  As far as knocking his teeth out, I never claimed I wasn't violent (growing up in New Orleans will do that too ya.)  Same as if he was in front of me and called my mother a bitch, if he was teenager, I'd probably slap the @#%$ out of him.  If he was a man, I'd probably break something.  Does that make me wrong and immature?  Maybe.. but thems the breaks.  The one to your kneecap WAS the warning shot.  If you think his comments were mature, you're about as @#%$ up as he is.<br>

Very few classes don't have problems. And no, necromancers don't have nearly the problems you seem to think they do. Needed on raids, great in groups, effortless solo experience from 1 to 60. I'm not here to debate Everquest schematics, but if you think necros are that fubar'ed, its your @#%$ thats stretched around your windpipe right now, not mine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I also notice that you seem to be my new &quot;follower&quot;.. check it out.. I have my own Chiteng. Should I expect that every time I post, you come on here with some drivel about my necromancer &quot;whines&quot;?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, two replies in how many of your posts regarding your necro whines. This one indirectly, and the other one a direct remark towards the initial thread in question. Delusional much? Just because you have a stupid cause doesn't mean you have a cult, much less a sycophantic following.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> As far as what skill I do or do not have, since I dont believe you've ever seen me game, you are once again talking out of your ass.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

I didn't say you sucked in the game. I said the evidence led to that conclusion, which I still think it does. <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Another product of your genius huh? Personally, I think that judging someone based on the color of their skin, what diety they choose to worship, or what they have/have not hanging between their legs is pretty childish and immature.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

See thats the problem with book smarts. Do you really see any connection regarding children (or child like thought) and racism? Think slowly... you can do it. As I originally stipulated, being racist/biased/etc. is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ignorant, but again, I said ignorance did not equal immaturity. I know just as many racist 10 year olds as I do 80 year olds. I can say the same about non-racists. Get the point? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I think he's both and you're almost in the same boat.

 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Negative comment? How about &quot;wheelchair bound pedophile&quot;. That is propagating a stereotype.. a VERY BAD inaccurate and negative one. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I said a WHOLE paragraph regarding why wheelchair!=wheelchair bound pedophile. I can fully understand your distaste with him comparing the two. I even agree, being handicapped has nothing to do with being a pedophile, or any other bad attribute. However, the difference is you get all defensive towards it, when the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> adult</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thing to do (Captain Grown up) would be to explain his ignorance, and the problem with it. Y'know, teach him, instead of lambasting him, and throwing a childish fit. But that would require a lack of hypocricy.<br>

<br>
Nobody was being prejudiced, chief. And if you call remarking to threats of violence on children by ex-military personnel as creating a miserable place to live in; well, then I'm guilty as charged. I guess I can get just as melodramatic as you, if I try hard enough. <br>
<br>
I've done some thinking, and it occured to me that I'm being far too politically correct with you. I forgot your a roughneck, it's no big deal if I state the obvious to you.<br>

Not too many, but enough to understand it, and not require the pity you seem to hold for them. I have sympathy for my black friends (I'm white) but I'm not going to threaten to beat people when they call them niggers, I respect them enough to let them fight their own battles.

See thats the difference, stupid. Nobody called your mom a bitch, and nobody directly insulted your poor Aunt Phyllis, or whomever it was you lost so dear to you. If someone had, you wouldn't be coming across as a moron with a temper to everyone here, but a loyal family member.<br>

My suggestion is to GET A LIFE!!! If not asked a lot of people mistake me to be much older, but the it's people like you that, once told, automatically form a stereotype for teenagers that probably know a LOT more than you in the first place. I have, however, have a friend that does match your description that was kicked out of his uber guild because of acting immature,(BTW his mains, 53bard 55necro, are both girls so that says a good bit about him as well) so I see why you might think all teenagers are like this because you think you know everything because you got a &quot;C&quot; average all through high school. IMO I think that people like you; who think that all teenagers are crap talking, sex-crazed, potheads; are the REAL whiners (ex. posting this in the first place)  I would also suggest that you find something more productive to do than bash on us just to raise your confidence in being older.  <br>
