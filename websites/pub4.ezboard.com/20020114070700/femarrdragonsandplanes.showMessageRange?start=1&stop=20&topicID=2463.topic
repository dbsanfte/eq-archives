The only thing that'll make me feel better is a series of negative shout outs, so... here we go!<br>
<br>
Fuck you to :<br>
<br>
Mrs. Matoba: Ah, my kindergarten teacher.  You were supposed to be my favorite, being my first teacher ever.  Instead, you were a racist piece of shit that didn't understand the fact that I had spoken Chinese my whole life up till then and couldn't understand a fucking word you were speaking.  My mother says you came by my house the last day of school because I was absent to bring my pencil box (and you seemed really apologetic for being a bitch to a 5 year old all year), but I don't care.  You made me cry.  Fuck you.  Are you dead yet?<br>
<br>
The blond boy in first grade in Mrs. Thompson's class- You threw my apple in my desk and bruised it.  I'll be your skinny ass liked it when Mrs. T told you to stand in the corner, didn't you?  <br>
<br>
Michelle-  I remember you from third grade, you skanky ho.  I was the only Asian girl and you picked on me relentlessly.  My mother told me, &quot;say something nice to her and she'll be nice.&quot;  Well, I did.  I complimented you on how pretty your crimped blonde hair looked.  Then your twisted self turned around and told on me, saying I made fun of your hair.  I hope you made it to the trailer park you were always bound for.  If people want someone to blame for me being blunt, rude and burly now, they can blame you.  I don't do compliments anymore.<br>
<br>
Peter- Fuck you, you sick little boy.  No, you're not twisted, you were literally sick with asthma and multiple allergies.  You were so sweet and so pretty, but you were always afraid of your grass allergy that I couldn't play tag with you.  I wanted to play tag with you terribly, but we couldn't run on the pavement.  Damn you.<br>
<br>
Tim L.- I had the biggest friggin' crush on you in 6th grade.  Fuck you for making fun of me all the damn time, trying to impress your friends.<br>
<br>
Annie S.- Fuck you, you then-7th grade whore, for dating /my/ Tim.  Fuck you, too, for volunteering to bring home my homework for me whenever I was absent from school.  Geez, thanks bitch.  Ever cross your mind that by doing that I wouldn't have any excuse to turn homework in late?<br>
<br>
Ryan C.- Fuck you!  Yes, you with your pretty, pretty eyes and bad boy ways.  My then-shy self was completely in love with you in 8th grade, but you were only talked to me to get my chocolate cookies out of my lunchbag.  <br>
<br>
Mrs. Ma- You worked at Arcadia Chinese School, the HELL my mother sent me to every day after school.  You had the classic middle-aged loud assed screech many Chinese women have.  Fuck you and your banshee screeching.<br>
<br>
Principle Chang- Thank you, bitch, for founding Arcadia Chinese School.  Thank you for making me attend and play manual labor for every event you sponsered.  I was glad when your husband didn't get re-elected onto the city council.  Fuck you.  Isn't your son a drop-out?<br>
<br>
Chris S.- Of all the things you had to call me, you had to call me &quot;Sumo.&quot;  Fuck you.  I found comfort, though, 10 years later when I found out you were rejected from the Navy for pot.  <br>
<br>
Mike R.- If I need a reason to shoot myself, you're that reason.  All of 8th grade I pined for you.  We were in journalism together and you were editor-in-chief.  I was the managing editor.  You didn't do jack and I did all of it.  Thank God I came to my senses before 8th grade ended and rejected your pansy assed, pale-as-hell, pimple-faced self.  Fuck you.  I was happy you turned out to be even moreso of a loser than you were by high school.<br>
<br>
Katie H.- Your voice was nauseating. Fuck you and your decrepit vocal chords.<br>
<br>
Mr. Meiers (or however the fuck you spelled your name)- Fuck you, you lowlife Republican, white trash, egotistical, chauvanistic, jock-loving, overweight, racist, sexist man.  Of all the teachers I ever had, you were the one who I found no redeeming qualities in.  I may be a Democrat, but the person I respected the most in high school was a hardcore Republican teacher.  He, at least, didn't burn me for not agreeing with his ideals.  You need a cow to stick its hoof into your tight ass.  Fuck you. Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You tried to fail me out of government class, but it didn't work, did it? HAH!<br>
<br>
Amy C.- You big, fat, wannabe Asian gangster, pot smoking, speed snorting, insecure, drop-out.  You tried to threaten my life because I called you fat.  Well, guess what?  You're 5'4&quot; and 170 lbs.  You /are/ fat.  You followed me around day after day in school hoping to corner me alone so you could whup my ass.  You never got me, though.  I'm a fucking cat with nine lives.  You're still fat, and I'll bet you're even fatter now.  Whatcha gonna do?  Hurt me through my phone line?  Fuck you.<br>
<br>
Roya V.- You were my best friend throughout freshman and sophomore year.  I stuck up for you through thick and thin.  I even stuck up for you against my mother who didn't believe you had enough integrity.  Well, you /do/ have integrity, but you have no backbone.  A fly has bigger balls than you.  You were the one who got me into the Amy C. shit, and when I called on you to help me (since you were the one who got the whole thing started), you ran like a limp dick from pussy.  Fuck you. <br>
<br>
Some dude working a toll booth in Jersey- I know you don't give change.  I didn't have change to give you, so I gave a bill.  I wasn't expecting change.  I even told you so.  I read perfectly fine, jackass.  Fuck you.<br>
<br>
My cousin Jenny- You skanky assed, anorexic whore.  I hope you and your rabid mother die.  I, for one, will not miss you.  You can take that alcoholic father and useless brother of yours with you.<br>
<br>
My dad- Pay the goddamn child support for my brother, assmunch!  Fuck you for the beatings with the ouchie end of the fly swapper!<br>
<br>
Eric T.- I know you're still my friend, but you borrow shit from me all the fucking time and you don't give it back.  Fuck you for that.   Oh, you also got me into shit with Elizabeth Ho, Vicky Vicious, and Lien Harlot in high school.  Fuck you for that, as well.<br>
<br>
Elizabeth L., Vicky- I told Eric I didn't quite like you bitches because you were so fake.  Newsflash.  You bitches /are/ fake.  Fucking drama queens and insincere sentiments are everything I'm against.  If I don't like you, I don't like you.  Get your anorexic, insecure asses over the fact that someone could possibly not like your perky! perky! happy! happy! selves.  Actually, most people thought you were jokes.  I was just the first one who voiced it.  Oh, and Liz, wash your fucking hair from time to time.  It's so oily and stringy it's disgusting.  Fuck you all.<br>
<br>
Lien R.- I heard you got knocked up by a married, 30something year old man, then eloped with a serviceman and ran off to Alaska.  Imagine my delight.  Fuck you.<br>
<br>
Judith- AHHHHHH! FUCK FUCK! GET AWAY FROM ME!<br>
<br>
Chris B.- You were so pretty a girl couldn't help herself from liking you.  Fuck you.<br>
<br>
Jenny- Whore.  Fuck you.  That's for trying to steal my husband.<br>
<br>
Cassie- See above.  Fuck you.<br>
<br>
Corey R.- You own a RP channel on DALnet called VampInn.  I used to hang around just because I had friends in there.  You have no place to live,  no car, no job, yet you believe you were worthy of my respect.  Fuck you.  Ok, now go back to being your delusional self and believe you are a vampire (or /vampyre/ as you spell it) prynce named &quot;Esher Ravenfire,&quot; Lord of Darkness.  Don't mynd me as I syt back and laugh.<br>
<br>
Fuck you!  The EQ Version:<br>
<br>
High Elf Bitch Named Aislya or Aslya (or whatever) that was in some guild named Circle of (something)- Fuck you.  You got so mad when I wouldn't RP with you so you could get your kicks out of chastising me for killing the ghey bard in Felwithe, you went ahead and forced me to RP anyway.  Oh, and to the leaders of that ghey guild, fuck you, too, for sticking up for your &quot;I-will-shove-RP-down-your-throat&quot; high elf whore.<br>
<br>
Cynthia- You were some high elf cleric from waaay back ago.  You cheated on a duel.  You pretended to be honorable, RPing to uphold the honor of elven kind.  Well, when I offered to duel you ran like a dog running from the neutering room to the guards.  Fuck you.<br>
<br>
Submina- Fuck that big ass of yours.<br>
<br>
Dwarkarn- Fuck you.  Why?  I dunno, actually.  Everybody seems to say that and I wanted to jump on the bandwagon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Mitch- See above.<br>
<br>
Chuk- See above.<br>
<br>
Grammaw- Fuck you for calling me cheap!  ;P<br>
<br>
Cao- Fuck you, Momma, for being the one to make me eat my words, &quot;I'll never respect a player playing a high elf female.&quot;  Dammit, now I have to find another race/sex combination to pour my animosity out on.<br>
<br>
The ghey kids that play EQ- You fuckers need new parents to monitor your playtimes.<br>
<br>
Shazanti- Fuck you for being so unattainable yet so delicious.<br>
<br>
Ezra- See above.<br>
<br>
All the cutesy wootsey floozy woozy flirty flighty princessy &quot;druidesses&quot;- DRUID.  Got that?  D-R-U-I-D  Not druid-ess.  Fuck you and your hello kitty obsessions.<br>
<br>
Nire- Fuck you!  Uh... hrmm.  You made them not kill the dragon with your jedi skillz!<br>
<br>
Delusio- You don't talk to me anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You don't call <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You don't come by when you say you will <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Fuck you, bastard!  (actually, scratch out the last two)<br>
<br>
Codsan- DAMMIT COD, FUCK YOU AND YOUR ELUSIVE, HUNKY, MARLBORO MAN WAYS!  (see above for &quot;Shazanti,&quot; as well)<br>
<br>
Tuan- Fu-... err.  I was about to say, &quot;Fuck you for being so goddamn cute,&quot; but I can't.  You're too fucking cute. <p><center>
