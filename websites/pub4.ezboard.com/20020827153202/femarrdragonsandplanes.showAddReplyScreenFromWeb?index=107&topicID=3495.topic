Did you argue this with the GM yesterday night, no you agreed to the terms.  You lost.  Do you have a right to be pissed? Sure.  Has ranting and flaming gotten you anywhere?  No.  Did PC lose too?  Yes.  Have they had the self dignity to be good losers, and not post 4 pages worth of crap badmouthing other guilds?  No, they haven't and I have more respect for them.  And for all of you that would badmouth me personally for writing this, I really don't care.  The members of any of the three guilds that know me will tell you that I am a very fair player and have gone out of my way to help them.  And some of them have posted here, which kind of disappoints me.  Now stop wasting your time pissing and moaning and get back to playing the GAME.  <br>

I'm currently at work and so cannot play the game, but I still think the Emarr public has a right to hear this.  If this is how these two guilds plan on treating the public at large, then the public should be made aware. If the people representing GL and PC yesterday had some respect, they wouyldn't be getting badmouthed here now.  Would they?  The reason PC wasn't perturbed is because they had no more right to take that spawn than GL did.  They were trying to muscle their way in as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udalamarndarkgem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalamarn Darkgem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 488<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/02 4:15:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Other guild response</span><hr size=1> I'm going to stop posting on this here until we hear from the leadership of the mentioned guilds.

Im not really sure the events that happened here and to be honest i never will for the sole fact im not gonna read thru all this BS just so i can once again say &quot;All u need is Love&quot; cause that gets old, all i am here to say is that Daka is one of the nicest most caring people ive had the pleasure to meet in game. Im really sorry all this had to happen but in this case it doesnt seem like finger pointing and name calling is gonna solve anything, some stuff was handled wrong by all of you, your all at fault PC, AD, and GL. Id like to think were all adults and capable of comming to reasonable decisions together. However i do understand in EQ that very rarely ever happens, however from what i can tell all 3 guilds lost there cool and acted like children. You ALL owe each other an apology and you ALL owe each other the respect to talk things out and get over it like civilized people.  Gnome Out O_o<br>

My cleric has no intentions of going thru all this for click stick. <br>
<br>
What I did want to address is the issue of the value of time spent camping an epic MOB. I thought that VI had addressed the issue of the value of time long ago and I dont know if they have applied it this way or not but I do remember seeing posts on the subject from VI. They have often described time as one of the currencies of advancement in the game. If this is true in terms of advancing levels, I would personally like to see them use it as a currency in terms of gaining an epic item. An epic is second only to level in terms of status. Even players with items better than the epic (LOTS of warriors) make sure they have their epic. I would hate to see a clerics epic devalued by shortening the length of the spawn time (and thus increasing the number of epics in game) but it really is a must in raid situations. The very fact that this server couldnt conduct this kill in an orderly list fashion, means that a FFA will never happen in a civilized fashion. If it could, then a list would have worked. Maybe the answer is for the top guilds to hire themselves out as mercenaries to the lower guilds as aid in the RF camp.  :P<br>
<br>
I hate posting on probs when I cant suggest a solution but I dont see one here that is satisfactory. <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

I got there in the evening (7 PM CDT) so not going to comment on events beforehand for which I don't have first hand knowledge, though I do find it assuming that others choose to do so (see: Freeze below).<br>
<br>
Ragefire:  Mob which has the last item needed to complete the cleric epic and the most covented epic item for a guild to complete for their cleric(s), because of the raid/mob saving nature of the ability of the watersprinkler.<br>
<br>
I remember when RF was first moved to SF and an e-marr town hall meeting was set up to make a decision with respect to the process (i.e. 'RF camp').  As I recall, it was decided to make the first spawn of the week FFA, and subsequently each cleric who was at the RF point (and could prove it) was given a 'lottery number' for which a moderator would roll to determine the lucky winner(s) for a given time frame.<br>
<br>
Basically because these rules were not followed, the whole situation/issue took place, which is unfortunate.  My opinion is that this community tries to resolve the RF to avoid a repeat of what happened last night.  <br>
<br>
I play the game because I enjoy it and last night was actually fun for me despite the ongoing dispute in /ooc.  I saw people in other guilds I don't talk trash to or hang with as much as I used to (including Lannados, Uzzy, and others).  In addition I was talking with others in both PC/RE/Affliction (and not about the who mess going on at the time).  Though I know only one person from an in-game encounter with an epic mob I'm sure I've grouped w/ several AD members in OS.  This game in my eyes is about two things 1) The people you interact with to make the game fun for all concerned and 2) levels (allowing the group/raid/guild your with to accomplish more with fewer people).<br>
<br>
Freeze:  You were not there at all and don't have any business making comments about guild reputation when you can't even follow through with your word to 'delete your character if you didn't get back into Greylords' as a quote you made to me 5 months ago while 'apologizing' to others.  Remember also trying to bad mouth guilds is bad for business not that you'll ever see any from me.  <br>
