I dont know why you felt the need to defend yourself previously against me accusing you of falsifying them.  I didnt accuse you of any such thing. I said they are out of context.  First off, for all I know they are from 1999.  Guess what, not one person in CE gives a crap about if Hopp posted in 1999.  Secondly, for all we know the post before that couldve been you telling him to F* off.  Hence those quotes ARE out of context.  They are one sided and they do NOT show the whole story.  Therefore you did not provide the information needed to validate your complaint.  I asked you for proof, you provided none.  Now in my book, if Hoppkins was reprimanded for something that was unproven wouldnt that be giving YOU preferential treatment Chit?<br>
<br>
Secondly as I posted before, you accused Hopp of making it known that he didnt want you in guild.  You provided no log, no ss, or even a &quot;your version&quot; of the dialog.  So...umm Hopp should be reprimanded because you tell me he should be..No chit Im sorry thats not the way we do things.  We try to be fair, that means you have to provide proof.  We dont punish people cause betty sue said we should.<br>
<br>
Funny to hear someone who crusades against &quot;preferential treament&quot; demanding his own preferential treatment.<br>
<br>
Btw, your accusation about us needing clerics and not monks.  I hate to tell you this Chit but you are sadly mistaken.  We have clerics for almost every group on raids Chit.  We have only 1-2 active monks that pull.  So that nice scenario about why you think Til did what he did is a good idea and everything...its simply not true and if you had one foggy inkling about our guild at that point in time, you would have known that.  We needed monks.  <br>
<br>
For those interested...Chits claim about harassment was &quot;he made disparaging comments about my attendance on the raid in front of other people&quot;  and &quot;he made it plain he didnt want me on the raid&quot;  Hmmm wonder why an officer would mention your attendance to you...*ponder*  Personally Chit, I think you are so full of hatred for Hopp, that you cant see past your nose.<br>
<br>
You got no response Chit because you had no valid proof for your complaint.  You may have been able to show that hop posted in R&amp;F *after* he was in CE.  However to this date you STILL havent even proven that.  And why the heck would you ask someone else to prove it for you.  Thats absurd.  <br>
<br>
Its pretty simply Chit.  You made an accusation with no supporting details.  I asked for supporting details.  You provided none.  Therefore your complaint was invalid.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
Seems easy enough to understand to me.  Sorry that you dont like it, but thats pretty much the facts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2113<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 5:55:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3664.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re: Ninya</span><hr size=1> My information about the guilds needs come from the posted information to that effect on your guild board.<br>
I didnt make it up, go read it. Your not recruiting monks.<br>
You are recruiting clerics. What can we infer from this?<br>
<br>
As for needing what you are calling 'proof' I just showed<br>
posts of Hoppkins flamming, and oddly enough I was told<br>
by Raedwulf that flamming 'Chiteng' isnt flamming someone. You didnt address that issue Ninya but if you insist on the dates of the posts I can do that easy.<br>
<br>
The posts I sent you were made between August 8th thru August 12th. Not a year ago or two years ago.<br>
Not even two months ago. But you still wont do anything<br>
will you?<br>
<br>
Dews posts were made in the same time frame.<br>
I have not reposted his. But you did get them.<br>
<br>
You dont need to accept my word on it. Does Hoppkins deny it? I would be happy to prove him a liar. Just give me the opportunity.<br>
<br>
Over 30 CE members heard his remarks. Are you telling me that they are all willing to lie about it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usuicidalslayne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suicidal Slayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1140<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 6:00:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3664.topic&index=41>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Ninya</span><hr size=1> Its hard to defend one issue when your using a completely different and irrelevant(sp) issue as your defense.<br>

Guess what Chit...IMO, thats called a response not a flame.  I didnt see him slam you. I did however see you make false accusations and call names.  You demanded his response and you got one...then you harassed him because he responded in a way different from what you wanted??  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> enough I was told<br>

You are the one that brought this issue here not me.  I could care less if he tells you that.  Thats your problem and you brought it on your self.  You made a public post, certainly you expected others to respond one way or the other.<br>
<br>
We arent recruiting monks *now* what does that have to do with then?  Most guilds recruiting needs change within a months time.  You seem to have a problem understanding that time is relevant in many situations.  Weve just added 2 monks to our roster so no we prolly wont recruit more until they are settled in if we do at all.  So in answer to your question, what we infer from this is that you have no clue of what you are talking about and are attempting to make people look bad by with your lack of knowledge.<br>
<br>
And you are gonna tell me NOW the date of the posts?  Thats intelligent Chit.  But you still havent shown me the threads...I still have no way to know that you didnt provoke him like you did Til.  If you do provide proof now, I honestly cant tell you what will happen.  See, we have officers..and they vote on things.  Its not that often that Til doles out punishment without it being discusses amongst all the officers.  Who knows, they might say that being harassed publicly by you is punishment enough.  <br>
<br>
I will not drag what Hopp says onto this board.  Hopp didnt come here and stir up @#%$, you did.  What Hopp and the rest of the guild says is between Hopp and his guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Over 30 CE members heard his remarks. Are you telling me that they are all willing to lie about it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
No Chit, Im telling you that I have no idea what you are talking about and I was supposedly there.  Obviously I must not have thought it bad or didnt see it.  Perhaps if you didnt wait 5 months or however long it was to complain then maybe someone would remember what you are talking about.  We raid prolly 10 times a week...and you think Im gonna remember 1 sentence from months back?   ummm sorry guess I just have to let you down on that one..my memory is NOT that good.  It doesnt sound like yours is either since you have yet to tell me exactly what was said.<br>
