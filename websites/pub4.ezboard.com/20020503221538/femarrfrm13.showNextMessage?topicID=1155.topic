First of all, this thread should be placed in the Rants and Flames section, for that is what this is. Second, I do not believe Moredith scammed anyone nor ninja looted.<br><br>Until you have tried to run a large scale pick up raid with many inexperienced people, you can not know just how difficult and stressful a raid can be on a raid leader. Moredith got upset with people breaking mez on additional mobs. He repeatedly tried to get people’s attention concerning the concept of “Main Assist.” He carried this raid all the way to completion, successfully taking down Naggy with minimum deaths. Non raid people found the raid channel, jumped on and spammed the channel while the raid was going on. People in zone who were not part of the raid kept trying to interfere, thinking they were being cute. I think Moredith did a great job holding the raid together in spite of many outside issues that no raid leader should have to endure.<br><br>Concerning the issue of his second account, Carathos. The character Carathos was present during the entire raid. I saw it there. Obviously Carathos could not take part in the raid since he was level 60, which anyone could see if they had done a /who in zone. Since Moredith was killed during the Naggy Raid, he used Carathos to secure the loot on Naggy. I understand why he did it and do not believe he had any intention to cheat the raid members. Would I have done it that way? No, but I am not him and he is not me. There must be some level of trust placed in a raid leader, otherwise, you should leave.<br><br>Concerning the issue of not announcing lottery numbers in raid chat. All raid leaders in large pick up raids must have a level of trust. Do you think in a planes raid there is time to announce the lottery number of everyone prior to a random roll on all the stuff dropped? If we tried doing that, loot would rot before winners could be decided. Moredith’s experience has been mostly from the planes raids. If I had led a Naggy or Vox raid, I too might have not announced the lottery numbers of all players simply because I am not used to it (I will certainly do so now if I ever decide to lead such a raid). But in the case of Moredith, he did announce the lottery numbers, except he mis-spoke and sent the information to his group rather than to the whole raid. Have none of you ever mis-sent something in chat? A tell to the wrong person? Speaking in guild when you meant to speak in group or vice versa? As soon as he had listed the lottery numbers in group he rolled and the winner was chosen. It was too late then to fix his mis-speak. I noticed a couple of those who lost, demanded a reroll. Would that have been fair to the one who legitimately won? Moredith’s group confirmed that he had stated the lottery number assignments in group by mistake. His group was made up of people from different guilds and some who did not know Moredith very well or at all. They all confirmed he told the truth. To continue claiming Moredith did something underhanded concerning his mis-speak, means that you are claiming six different people (all those in his group), many of whom have no vested interest in lying, lied. Come on now, this is ridiculous.<br><br>Concerning the pally book, I must admit that I too am confused. I scrolled back up my chat box and did not see the book mentioned with the other loot. In this regard, I must fall back on my experience with Moredith/Carathos and my experience with him tells me that he would not cheat anyone. But I would like to see more about this particular topic myself. The pally who won the book, Harsh, is not a friend of Moredith’s. He is not in the same guild. Perhaps Harsh could clear up some of the issues by posting here, I hope he does.<br><br>Concerning his foul language (mentioned in the other thread). Yes, I did not like the foul language being used in chat, just like several others. I do understand why it was used. It was a release of stress that I suspect many of us have been guilty of, if not in EQ then certainly in real life. You can’t tell me that when you bash a knuckle against an engine block when you are replacing a part that some choice word or words do not leak out. Remember that we had some pick up raid members who didn’t seem to know what they were doing. I’ve heard plenty of enchanters curse like sailors when their mezzes repeatedly get broken by idiots. The non raid bozos who interfered in the raid chat channel or in zone also added enormous stress to the raid leader. Would I have cursed like that in chat? No, but then again, people are different and respond in different ways. I ignored the cursing and focused on the raid. Again, if you don’t like the style of a raid leader, then don’t attend any more of his or her raids.<br><br>The bottom line is this – if anyone thinks anyone else ninja looted something, all you need to do is petition a GM and they can review the zone logs and tell you exactly who looted what. Such a petition will take a lot of time for the GM’s but they have done this before for other suspected ninja lootings. I do not believe there is any basis to the claim that Moredith/Carathos ninja looted. I challenge those who claim he did to involve the GM’s and let’s put this issue to rest once and for all. Those who think he ninja looted are basing their beliefs on impressions and perceptions, not actual facts. You bring me the facts and if they support the claim of ninja looting, I will be the first to change my mind. Will I attend any future raids that Moredith/Carathos leads? Yes. Afterall, the raid was successful, we took down Naggy, and very few people were killed. That’s the kind of raid I will attend again.<br><br> <p><p><img src="http://www.eqicon.com/graphics/ICoN_sean.jpg" width="180" height="140">   <br>  <font color="#FF0033"><b><a href="mailto:seanchans@yahoo.com">Seanchans</a><br>  52 Shaman and Guild Leader, <a href="http://www.eqicon.com">Inner Circle of   Norrath</a><br>  Erollisi Marr Server<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=126765">Inspect Me if You Really Must</a></b></font><br>  <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0033"><i>"A few people   working together to build a better future"</i></font></b> </p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uashreyl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ashreyl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/8/02 8:36:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1146.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ALL PLEASE READ CONCERNING NINJA LOOTER!</span><hr size=1> Sean, <br><br>I am going from the information on your post alone and I am going to trust that your belief that Moredith did not mean to cheat or mislead anyone. I am a former Vox/Naggy raid leader who has taken 40+ people on raids and still kept things under control and gave names and numbers even when i was rolling a tink bag to the whole raid. While I'm sure Mor did a fine job of getting the dragon killed, but you can't suddenly get sloppy when the dragon dies. Pally books need to be rolled as soon as you know they are on the corpse (as they are no drop), all rolls really should be shown in whatever channel you are using and you need to make sure everyone is ressed/aware that you are about to roll by giving everyone a moment to respond if they dont see their name on the list. If the names were announced in group and Mor did not get the tell that he missent the tell to /groupsay in time to catch him from rolling there is really only one explanation: he was impatient. It is not fair to have people who are paying attention not know what is going on. No comment on the swearing at people business.<br><br>If this is a one time thing and Mor was just stressed, fine, i excuse him. If he plans on leading all his raids in such a sloppy manner, i dont blame people for being upset and not wanting to go on more of his raids.<br><br> <p>The most useful thing you can do to enemies is make them  friends; <br>If you can make their eyes glaze over too, it's a plus.<br>Ashreyl Benesephiir <br>Leader Legion of Might</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujosiahsupertank.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JosiahSupertank</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/8/02 9:43:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1146.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ALL PLEASE READ CONCERNING NINJA LOOTER!</span><hr size=1> Ok guys...my 2 cp.<br><br>I too have lead many raids on dragons...some small (20 people)....some huge (51 people).

I will never condone it and i have experienced it.

The truth is that is is hard as hell to lead an efficient raid...especially when people dont listen.

(I assume using a 10-sided die or some other method was used) <br><br>When the non-winning paladins were informed a book had actually dropped and someone else got it, they went INSANE, as they should have, (see prior post), since no list and roll was publicly done.<br><br>4. The list for scale roll was never said prior to roll, a number 1-10 was rolled and a person won. It was later mentioned by some of the group members that he listed in group not in say. Roll was 50+ as stated prior to raid on emarr board, but never to the people that showed up that didn’t sign up. (It would have been nice to let people see their numbers before the roll)<br><br>5. Rule of only Moredith looting dragon was broken by his druid (Himself) looting which led many people to perceive ninja. This was a huge mistake, making a lot of people in the raid feel ripped off, myself included. Without having a full group to confirm looted items, you really put yourself at risk of losing reputation/trust even if you mean well. Remember perception goes a long way. Also, why was the pally book looted by a non-pally?<br><br>What went well:<br>1. Buffline was handled very quickly and properly by Moredith, and the buffers.<br>2. Resses were done quick also, good job as usual clerics.<br>3. Dragon was killed using proper tactics, nice teamwork for the smackdown.<br>4. Some people won loot, congrats to all that won.<br>5. Some people had fun, myself included.<br>6. My abilities to get screenshots of the reported loot, only if I knew how to post them.<br>7. My abilities to avoid winning any useful loot.<br><br>Hopefully these same mistakes can be learned from and not repeated in future raids. I still had fun and still plan to continue dragon raiding.<br><br>Bodar aka: Dorfius the Rogue <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucrinkletheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CrinkletheRanger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/8/02 6:02:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1146.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ALL PLEASE READ CONCERNING NINJA LOOTER!</span><hr size=1> ok a couple of things I was wondering about while reading the post.<br>This is a naggy raid, what are you mezzing? giants can only be charmed, most people around 52 should be able to solo a ldc with a heal or two even if they were breaking a mez, just dont mez the mob again let the idiot die with 8 groups each group just grab a ldc<br>How do you exscuse looting a pally book if you arnt a paladin / didnt win the roll? to me that seems just plain <br>I want pally book , I take pally book regardless , I have pally book<br>Carathos is in Kaizen'X I doubt they will care very much over his actions.<br>Carathos / Moredith always was nice, and helped me out.

Did you and I, Psycho, attend the same Naggy Raid?<br><br>"He ninja'd the pally book,"<br><br>This has not been proven to me yet, although in my earlier post to this thread, I want to see more of the facts surrounding the book because I am very unclear as to what happened in this category. Mind you, I want to see the "facts," not the assumptions or preconceived conclusions.<br><br>"put a bunch of his alt/friends names in the rolls who WERENT on the raid,"<br><br>He did? Granted, I wasn't comparing the names he listed to the people in the raid, but you have proof of this? Please post the names that were announced for the roll so that we can confirm they were alt/friends of his. If you are simply grand standing and making statements without facts to back them up, how can we accept anything else you have said?<br><br>"and he didnt call the numbers for the dragon scale. Just went "/random 1 10 and this time it turned up a 6."<br><br>Yes, we have established he did not call the names of people and their lottery numbers in raid channel prior to the roll. But the roll he did was a legit roll, the kind that occurs automatically in the EQ program when you /random. I'm not sure what evil thing you are trying to point out with the random roll, the mechanics are automatic within EQ. And you have left out a critical piece of evidence, the testimonies of those people in his group who saw his mistaken listing of the people in the random. So, the truth is that he "did" call the numbers for the dragon scale, he just didn't call them in the raid channel. That still doesn't excuse the mistake, but he did call the names. Just ask those grouped with him.<br><br>"then he said "oh my friend soandso was six, goes to him."<br><br>I do not recall him saying anything of the sort. Post a log please that proves he said this.<br><br>"The way we found out about the aply book thing was cus he was bragging to some guy about it."<br><br>Oh really? Who was the guy to whom he was bragging? What exactly did he say? Who can corroborate your statement?<br><br>"Nobody knows what actually dropped on that raid becuase he looted with his UNGROUPED druid."<br><br>For the people who are more authorities on Naggy, how many items typically drop from the dragon? What I recall seeing him say in raid channel was the following:  "diamond, ruby crown, opal, prayers of life, red dragon scale, gofm." I think some of those items came from some of the earlier mobs. I was looter for my group and  I looted an opal from one of the fire giants and gave it to Moredith. I think the opal he listed was the one I originally looted. So, let's apply logic to this situation. Someone please tell us how many items typically drop from Naggy and what kind of items are they? If we know this, then we can compare to the list Moredith stated in raid chat.<br><br>"This guys rep should be ruined on Erollisi and he should not be put in raids ever again."<br><br>If he ninja looted and mislead the raid members on available loot, then yes his rep should be ruined and no one should ever trust him again. But before we jumped to this extreme conclusion, let's back it up with facts. Let's also hear from the others involved. I am not a stupid person. Part of my not being stupid is based on my insistence to see unbiased facts to support a position or view. So far, I have only seen innuendos, broad and unsubstantiated statements, and now this personal attack.

But what bugged me is he kept talking about his SK and asking me all about my SK stuff and about the SK stuff that drops in chardok.<br> Now on to the point.. a nice melee axe dropped near the end of the raid, we decided to go outside and random it. Psyblade said he would random the loot but apparently Carathos(who was groupleader and had looted axe) would have none of that and took over with the "give me tells if you're in" message.<br><br> He then gave the roll call and to the melees fury added in casters to the roll as well as himself(claiming he was "rolling it for his alt SK"..) Another cleric was "rolling for his brother" as well. But then told my cleric friend he could not be in roll because it was not "open random"...<br><br> Granted, Psyblade didn't announce NBG pre raid and the axe was really the only item that dropped worth anything. No hard feelings to Psy, the loot was in Car's hands and they had the defense of no NBG rules announced and that it would NOT BE SOLD. I personally did not need the weapon as good as it was.. but other melees there like Lorce and Zakad(sp?) really could've used a nice 2hander. I put myself in claiming if they were rolling for other characters I would roll and give it to one of the other melees present.<br><br> Of course Carathos won the random and then the tanks got vulgar :)<br><br> now all that explained, as I hear tell (notice I say hear).. this weapon was sold to one of the tanks on that particular raid recently by Carathos in one of his personas. I won't say which tank bought it, he can speak up himself if he wants and I don't want to make him feel foolish for lining a greedmuffin's pocketbook. <br><br> Normally I overlook these reports about people being lame like this.. but when I've had previous experiences with them it kinda makes me take notice.

CONCERNING NINJA LOOTER!</span><hr size=1> I met Carathos one day in Lower Guk where he pled me just for the hell of it while I learned the dungeon and helped him get a drop...since then I have had the pleasure of grouping with him AND Moredeth if not both. He led a fear raid with great success, we ruled Lower Guk with the help of our group (I pulled EE and half the zone to Frenzi and we took it all down) ... and I was there for Chardok.<br><br>Regarding Chardok….. <br>he rolled because his druid was there out of need (we had 2 clerics I think) when he would have liked to bring his SK, but was nice enough to put help where it was needed. He and the raid leader were the only non-NBG in the roll (raid leader rolled because we didn't have enough time to get her the epic piece she needed, so it was out of mercy). There were NO loot rules for the raid, and we decided what was fair and rolled (I was not allowed to roll for my alt btw). Only after the roll did people start complaining.<br><br>Sorry I wasn't there for the dragon, but I want to stand up for the guy.<br><br>He is honest. He is definately not ebayed, in fact he is more knowledgeable then many I have played with. <br><br>Most importantly.... ubber noobs are the worst. It’s a lot more fun to lead raids when people know what they are doing. Nothing is more frustrating then having a tank shout incoming and seeing everyone and there mother rush a mob out side of camp and begin to fight in a dangerous area while the mob runs around out of control hitting the enches and shammys and clerics. I have called off a raid because I couldn't get people to put /LFG on...lol. So if he is like me, and half the people aren't listing and the fun has been sucked out of the entire exp, I understand the cussing...weather it was appropriate or not is another matter.<br><br>Sorry I wasn't there for this raid, if I knew he was leading I would have come right away... all I can say is...Carathos if your out there... its worth spending a little time to make people happy. So listen to what they say bothers them and make it a point to do it the way THEY like next time even if it takes a bit longer. You cannot beat a mob mentality, and I am pleased to see many shout for the facts instead of shouting useless hearsay. As a wise man once said... the truth is out there ;p<br><br>- Quichan (how do I get my sig working...pst<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Pain<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uquichanpaine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quichan Paine</A> at: 4/9/02 5:33:47 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=1146.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=1146.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=1146.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=1146.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1146.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=1146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.threadControl?topicID=1146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1146.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1146.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying -
