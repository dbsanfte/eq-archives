I have had quite a few almost run-ins with you over my time online, and from friends who knew you better, I am thinking that that is my loss.  One thing comes to mind, however, although I am sure you do not remember it.<br>
<br>
Way back when, you must have been about 54 at the time, you ran across a fledgling ranger in FV who had died making an ill-advised attempt to run through DL.  Instead of providing directions to the DL zone line, you went there yourself, grabbed the body, dragged it to the zone, and rezzed and proceeded to buff the crap out of him.  As should be obvious, that ranger was me, and that event stuck with me for a long while afterwords as one of the nicest things I have personally seen in EQ.  WHen I get requests for help, I try to go about it with the same degree of style and generosity as you displayed there.  Its all pixels, but your actions helped a lot of others, even the small, easily forgettable actions of a year or more back.<br>
<br>
I know what RL troubles can do with the perception of this game and your enjoyment of it, and I wish you luck in resolving them.  We as a server are better for having known you and poorer for having lost you. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.

<br>
Very important concept there Sage, and thank you. I wish you well in your Journey. I too had to make some choices to preserve the fun I desired out of EQ. When it became a burden and chore and not fun I was ready to quit. Fortunately I found other options. Fun is the key, I like you don't want to do this if its not fun anymore.<br>

<br>
Theo -- I probably *was* unnecessarily abrasive at times.  Online games and message boards tend to bring out the best and the worst of human nature.  I'm hardly the worst offender in that respect.  Anyway, you were always one of the genuine class acts on the server, and I'm sorry we never got to know each other.<br>
<br>
Riv -- Hockey may be fun, but you'll never lose any teeth in EQ.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?<br>
<br>
Lurkerr -- Damn nice signature graphic.<br>
<br>
Rekcim -- As Dwark said, I'm not dumping on EQ.  In hindsight, my only real gripe about the game itself is that the rewards tend to be quantitative (levels and stats on gear), as opposed to qualitative.  The emphasis on quantitative rewards is what causes all the problems with spawns like Ragefire (the cleric epic tends to be more important as a status symbol than as an actual functional piece of gear) and with the high-level game (which is a progressive series of time sinks that provide increasing quality of gear if you have a high tolerance for repetition).  I've seen signs that Verant recognizes this problem, and I'd bet that EQ2 will have more qualitative rewards.<br>
<br>
A lot of people enjoy the quantitative aspect of the game, and there's nothing wrong with that.  As I look back on my time on EMarr, though, my favorite memories are of qualitative achievements, such as figuring out how to run a successful pickup raid to Fear.  By the time RL circumstances forced me into retirement, the game had become almost purely quantitative, and I wasn't having much fun with it.  In hindsight, I was looking for relief from the mindless tedium of the high-level game by doing things like trying to take an experience group all the way down to the undead tower in The Hole.  We got close once, and I'm sure we would have pulled it off before long.<br>
<br>
That brings me back to my message: if you aren't *really* having fun with EQ, think about either quitting or changing what you're doing in EQ.  Despite what you think, a lot of EQ players are in denial over the fact that they're bored with the game and aren't having fun.  What's the point of being addicted to something if you aren't even getting a good buzz?<br>
<br>
Iwka -- I'd wondered what happened to you.  I hope all is well with you in real life.  You were a great person to have along on a raid.<br>
<br>
Abbyt -- I wonder how many of the old Sons of Tao people are still around?  There were so many people who just vanished along the way.  Such is the way of EQ, though.<br>
<br>
Malevant -- I don't remember the rez that you described, but I did that sort of thing a lot.  Perhaps the most satisfying thing about playing a cleric was that you could bring some light into someone's online life by restoring lost experience or saving them a long CR.  For me, that was one of the qualitative rewards of the game -- I quit accepting payment for rezzes long ago.<br>
<br>
Toein -- Glad to see that you didn't totally burn yourself out.  It looked like you were well on the way. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

Nowhere near the worst offender, not even close.  Your intentions always showed through, if one put aside their own opinion long enough to see it.<br>
<br>
We never played together, that is true.  Actually, I think we may have in our early early youth once or twice.  But that's not my point.<br>
<br>
My point is that I'm glad that I got to know you.  Thoughtful, well-intentioned, and intelligent.  That's how I choose to remember you.  The rest of it was just the process it took to get to know that about you.<br>
<br>
Take care and I hope you find what it is you need.<br>

Safe journeys to you.  I completely understand your perspective.  I find periodic breaks from the game for a week or so help it remain fun.<br>
<br>
I did not agree with many of your opinions concerning the old attempt to solve the RF spawn problem (once again appearing on these boards as an active topic), but I did respect your position always.  You spoke with intelligence, which is more than some did.  Your idea had merit, unfortunately the greed of some precluded it (in any form) from becoming accepted by all.  The occasional abrasiveness happens...<br>
