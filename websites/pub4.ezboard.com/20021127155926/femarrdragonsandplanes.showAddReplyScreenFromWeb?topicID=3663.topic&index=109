Oh azz face, druids get lost... know your char before trying to tell me how to play mine. Although if you stuck around before gating you would of known I was right there, through heals to everyone and trying to cast an evac... I got 3 years invested into 3 chars, 2 years as a guild leader, and have sacraficed more time and exp for my guild mates then you do total playing time! <br>
Your a poor excuse for a human, a poor excuse of a vet, and a REALLY poor shaman! I believe your warrior will do better seeing how you didn't buy him!<br>

<br>
As a former U.S. Marine, I say you are full of @#%$ on just about every military thing you mentioned.  The military NEVER EVER teaches you to bail.  You fight till you run out of ammo, then you pull your knife, and fight till its gone, then choke your enemies until you cant fight any more.  If you spewed your @#%$ in a hotzone with my old crew, you wouldn't have to worry about the enemy.  They'd shoot you themselves before having you to catch their backs.<br>
<br>
Majored in English?  You cant even write in it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1. druids never get lost. they have track <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> You are just about the biggest fvcking idiot I've ever seen on these boards... and that's an accomplishment worth getting a plaque for.  Before running your dork-buffer, why dont you look up what track does.<br>
<br>
I use Root (yep regular root spell) to crowd control in the planes (I'm a necro with less than half your hps).  I use regular old root to solo mobs that you apparently would @#%$ your pants and run to desktop if you saw.<br>
<br>
Your guild is your family.  You NEVER abandon family.  As far as save your own ass, I will intentionally chain cast my biggest nukes and sit at the feet of a mob (GUARANTEED to pull argo off of anything) with all 950 of my HPs to get the mob off of our cleric (or our chanter) so the group may live  or at least let a cleric get out to rezz everyone.<br>
<br>
Get in Magister?  You have got to be kidding me.  If you would have kept your mouth shut, you would have come out of his thread ok.  After opening it, I can promise you will never be in my guild and sure many others feel the same.<br>
<br>
The military, family, sickness thing has NOTHING to do with your skills (or lack thereof) and the way you play this game.<br>
<br>
The BEST thing you can do for yourself is listen to the VERY GOOD shamans here who are giving you advice that you dont deserve.  Go to that board someone posted and learn about your class.  Better yet, make a druid.  Every other idiot does.. and at least you'd never have to worry about getting lost. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

Shanny just called me cuz I was slackin and not online gettin my 60 ;)<br>
<br>
Ok..a few things to clear up...  I was the 59 pally (god help us).  We did fine up to the camp itself.  Dark hit the trap and was feelin the heat.  I went to the side to try and throw him heals, but he was already dead.  I then told the group to chill there at camp and I'll drag his corpse out.  I also had not done the Efreeti camp before, so I was clueless, but I get points for trying ;)<br>
<br>
I had levi and walked around the pit to see if I could locate his corpse by sight...no luck.  I then realized I was slowly descending into the nice pretty orange colors ;)  Probably should have been lookin for the edge before I moved beyond it..heh<br>
<br>
I floated above the lava for a bit locating Dark's corpse.  When I got it, they got aggro.  I was NOT there when it happened, unfortunately.  I then frantically searched for a way out of the lava, and couldn't find one.  I tried to get to the edge nearest them to throw some support heals...Out of range (typical).  I watched everyone's health start to deteriorate and felt pretty much helpless as I dragged around a fatass white bear corpse *snicker*.<br>
<br>
Shantara WAS there as far as I was concerned...I heard the spam heal chats, and could see through the wall a little bit if I turned a certain angle.  But maybe you chickened out too fast to see the rest of the group trying to actually pull it together.<br>
<br>
Almost everyone was dead, and I got some aggro, and began to solo I believe an imp (if my memory serves correctly...which normally it doesn't).  Everyone was dead by the time I got the imp to a point of running.  I got a bright idea (not that it happens all the time mind you) that I'd follow the fleeing imp wherever he went to find a way outta here.  Lo and behold, @#%$, there's a way outta the lava ;)<br>
<br>
Everyone is dead, I finish off the mob in the lava, and manage to go back and drag Dark's corpse to a ledge near some bats in a hallway.  I rezzed him up, and we both proceeded to clear the way back duo so I could rez the rest.  You had logged by this time, which is still a question to me..why you did log.<br>
<br>
Now then...  First things first...  I've caused many a wipeout before...but I've never once abandoned anyone for any reason.  That's just pathetic and unforgiveable.<br>
<br>
Second..don't ever compare yourself to Dark, because you could never play at the level he plays at.  I would have died for sure clearing the way to Efreeti again for CR if you were with me instead of Dark.  Dark knows how to play his shaman.  I can understand that you may have low brain power, and can't ponder how someone can play like he can...so you have to knock his skills and search for something to point out..e.g....him "suiciding" (lol) into the lava.  You will NEVER be able to play a shaman as well as Dark can...don't ever put yourself on his level.<br>
<br>
Third...you are a disgrace to the US Military Forces, your stepdad or father whichever, and me.  I was in the Army, and you NEVER leave your man behind.  What you brought up was a bunch of horse-@#%$ that you got off a TV screen somewhere.  I am glad I never knew you in the military, or we would have given you a beating.  You were probably the guy that always got our platoon busted and never knew the meaning of teamwork.<br>
<br>
Fourth...I was once a hardhead, and didn't listen to my superiors (if that's the word I'm thinkin of..)  When I finally started losing respected friends over it, I stopped, and I listened.  I have gained more in life to this day for thinking this way.  It's time to move from childish ways and think of those around you.<br>
<br>
Fifth...you obviously will not give a damn about this, because you "only care for yourself"...because when you were a G.I. Joe, they taught you to only kill people and take no prisoners.  What country you take your training in btw?  Take it for whatever it's worth.<br>
<br>
Sixth...adding to this...I'm sure you are happy now without a guild, due to you being all for yourself.  If you get into a guild that has heard of this incident, and doesn't care...more power to em.  But I'm sure you wouldn't care as you are all about yourself and would probably rather go solo, yes?<br>
<br>
I am glad you will find whatever it is you're looking for.  I'm doubly happy that Legion of Ka will be now without a deserter such as yourself.<br>

Hiya folks,<br>
<br>
Wouldn't you know it? I step away from the forum for a couple of days and the bloody thing explodes. Over a hundred postings on this thread in two days, not bad. Not bad at all.<br>
<br>
I was content to just read it until I happened to see my guild mentioned. Kilmal stated on page one of this thread:<br>
<br>
"i have gotten guild invites but they didnt match the requirements. from of coures bludysky's guild, ICoN among others. "<br>
<br>
As Guild Leader of ICoN (Inner Circle of Norrath) I must set the record straight. Kilmal has not received a guild invite from us. From what I have read, he never will receive a guild invite from us. In fact, ICoN and Legion of Ka have had a close guild alliance for a very long time. Part of our alliance is a firm agreement that neither guild will allow crossovers, thus, protecting the integrity of each guild - so it would have been impossible for ICoN to offer membership to Kilmal. Back when both of our guilds were small guilds, we helped each other in groupings and raids. Now that ICoN has grown into a decent upper middle level guild, we still are close allies and friends with Legion of Ka. They are good people who I call friends. Shantara and Darkforest can be trusted to lay out the truth and stick with their friends through thick and thin.<br>
<br>
/steps on soapbox<br>
<br>
I also have followed the postings about what a shammy should or should not do. I'm a 54 shammy who doesn't level very fast since guild cares and real life kinda slows the experience growth, but I feel I've learned a few things along the way. The main thing I've learned is that there are some very good shammy players out there from whom I can still learn a thing or two. Gloriana is nearly a shammy legend on Emarr, she's been around long enough and played enough to know the shammy and how it should be played. Kilmal, if you are reading this, you would do well to listen to her advice, stop arguing, and benefit by what she has learned over the years of playing a shammy. From my own point of view, I see a shammy as adaptive to fill a variety of roles in a group or raid, depending on what is needed. I dot, I dd, I slow, I heal, I crowd control, I melee, I gain aggro, I buff, I pet, I pull, and I die - a LOT. If a caster, especially a cleric or chanter, is getting beat on by a mob and the tanks can't help, I stand between the caster and mob and gain aggro because I can survive a heckula lot longer getting beat on than the typical caster. I am constantly watching my group and will toss a heal on a member if it looks like they are nearing that last bub of health. I use my epic spear's dot to start some mobs cooking while I root them when we have multiple pulls. I don't do anything special that hasn't already been mentioned, I play my shammy as a jack of all trades, balancing wisdom with AC and with resists. I don't care if my wisdom never goes beyond 150 because I also want AC so I can take hits - any good shammy worth their salt will do the same. We have so many different roles and the roles change depending on groups, raids, and situations - that's why I LOVE playing my shammy.<br>
<br>
/steps off soapbox<br>
<br>
Kilmal, simply admit that your "save number 1" attitude is wrong, apologize for abandoning your guildmates in a tight spot, learn from the situation, and move on. There is no shame in recognizing you made a mistake - we all make mistakes. The shame is when we try to cover up our mistakes or make light of them or ignore them entirely. You were wrong to log off as you did. The sooner you understand that and stop trying to split hairs, the faster you will be able to rebuild your reputation.<br>
<br>
Shantara and Darkforest, I am sorry you two and your guild are going through this very public affair. I applaud you for choosing to take the heat and have Kragarn post this warning thread. There are sharks who troll this forum looking to score a few hits here and there, but I understand what you were trying to do with this thread - warn other guilds of the negative experience you had with a former member. I will group with you two and any of the Legion of Ka people anytime, anywhere. You're good people and I like to be around good people.<br>
<br>
God bless,<br>

<br>
&quot; I will apologize when hell freezes over.&quot; <br>
<br>
and if everyone want to play the blame game then that is fine. all members of the party messed up in their own way  shan didnt or couldnt evac. dark relyed on a spell that is well known for failing in the worst places, me for not &quot; being there for moral support during the CR&quot;  lilly i swear did her best as did sig but lilly had gate. she could have gated before she died. the rogue well i didnt see him anywhere in the room and i was playing pingpong with roots and them imp protectors. sig much like a warrior has to rely on others that can evac him out of a death situation. shan as i promised i wont say anything negative. i did see the spam but with 9 items (counting if all members minus the dead were in the room) is alot to have to sort through, but that still leaves dark, krag and lilly to apoglize. and untill then no. i cant remember which officer it was, but you arent the only one that can invite into the guild. you are the only one that can make officers.<br>
<br>
i have never heard of Gloriana, but have heard of toerin. i think i spelled his name right. BTW what does &quot;worth their salt&quot; mean? i dont know the meaning of that. scroll bac a few pages where i did a public apology to shantara. i did admit that i could buff as there was a 2 lv senior that would out do mine. and that if anything i could have sat omn my thumbs saying &quot; thats alright. we get it next time&quot; . shoot with the spear of fate why  not go dot the entire zone and just root. let the killer dot for the spear kill them?<br>
<br>
Not all members of ka are all that bad queg i helped him get some ring for his epic i think. was in western waste i think. had to find some rabid mob for its pelt. lots of snow and giants right by the rygor fort is about all i can really remember. plus i helped get some lute from MM when i got the dire wolf hide for the shammy only sow boots (epic). the guild said they would take care of thr mobs while i did the turn in. . i had to get 2 hired thugs to just draw aggro off me while i did it. i had a lift out for them too. but in all yes they helped me get parts of my epic and i helped other in ka with their epic. so to say that i wasnt there to help out is not true. you have to ask where is it all going? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
