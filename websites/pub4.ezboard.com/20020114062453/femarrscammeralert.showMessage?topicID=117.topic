I was in a Frenzy group and after many spawns of place holders the Frenzied Ghould spawned. To our delight on the corpse was an FBSS. The group rolled for this prized item and Crackie was in the lead with a 76. Crackie looted the FBSS and cheered. The exception to this was the cleric had not yet rolled. When the Cleric did roll and 77 appeared on the screen. The cleric had won. However instead of turning the FBSS over to the cleric, Crackie sat down and logged with out a word to anyone. I believe that he is Legions of Fate, but can not be certain of this. <br>
<br>
There is nothing that ticks me off more than people that have to cheat and steal to achieve and this is one enchanter that will never be in another group with me. I encourage all to aware of this individual. <br>

I never thought he would steal an item, but since I was only there for the initial roll I couldn't say.<br>
<br>
A couple of us were hanging out in the frenzy waiting on an IU after we got wiped out near the King room.  The sash dropped and people rolled.  Crackie got a 76 and right away the others said &quot;congrats&quot; and let him loot it - if someone hadn't rolled would that have been the case?<br>
<br>
After that I walked all the way out of guk without hearing any comments on ooc or shout, that took maybe 5-10 minutes.  I don't want to say that anybody is wrong, or he didn't steal the sash, but it doesn't seem like something he would do, and it seems like there is more to this than has been posted.<br>

PS. I was forced to write here, cause I just CANT believe the lies and misinformations that has been spread by a so-called an honorable guild, just because a trusted guildie makes a mistake. <br>
<br>
Nerrick, if your cha name is Nerrick, ya was NEVER there, your group with IU? lets give the names, so we all can verify it, cause Cyrrain, me and Naguk was sitting there for ages waiting for Crackie to get back, and you must be invis, as we never saw ya! As for Caeill, thanks, you know that the moment Crackie camped, we all discuss it at ooc, so this person must be lying that he didnt saw it, see?<br>
<br>
Let this episode slide, friends that are suppose to be honest, will sometime overcome by greed of the moment, many people can confirm it here, as it will be you versus him, if no witness was there. Lucky Cyrrain was there, see? Provide name, so people can decide for themselves.<br>
<br>
For your info, after the sad episode, me and Naguk cant bear to play anymore, hmm is it 10+ hours camp and finally FBSS drop? so we let Cyrrain take over the camp and yes, when I come back 10+ hours later, Cyrrain is still there, as leader of group. I feel so sad for Naguk, that he cant bear to play there anymore, he is going Odus, and I might leave for hmm lets see, Kunark or Velious? oh yeah, I need to get Turning of the Unnatural and Celestial Healing.<br>

<br>
This wasn't said in the first place, of course it makes it more obvious what happened.  I never said I was right, or that he didn't camp out, just that I had grouped with him before down there in Guk and he had never been anything but honorable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for Caeill, thanks, you know that the moment Crackie camped, we all discuss it at ooc, so this person must be lying that he didnt saw it, see?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What I meant by what I said is that since I didn't see the ooc comments on my way out, then they must have occurred after I left, which made me wonder why it took at least 10 minutes for the cleric to realize he didn't roll and then comment on it.<br>
<br>
For the record I just posted in the first place because I wanted to say something good about Crackie in the hopes that he made an honest mistake, because based on my experiences he is not a scammer.  This in no way condones scamming, and if the sash belongs to you then great I hope you get it back and the appropriate actions or disciplines are taken.<br>
<br>
One thing you are right about, is it should be dropped since it's turning into one person's word against another, just let the GM's sort it out.  Also it's really difficult to read what either of you are saying, so I'll end by saying maybe I didn't know Crackie as well as I thought I did, or maybe the whole thing was just an honest mistake.<br>

<br>
Hmm I will try to make a more comprehensible post, sorry if I failed. Only read if you are interested, this is a warning. English is NOT my mother's tounge. =p<br>
<br>
1. For anyone that had ever deal with Verant, they will know how slow they usually works. Yet, how long does it took to suspend your account? I believe it took 1 day ONLY, that will be clue enough, log NEVER lies.<br>
Naguk petition and report with the winning roll and the many beggings from us asking for ya to give it back, hence the evidence got ya suspended. Some people will accept that as FINAL closing, hard truth.<br>
<br>
2. Have ya ever group before? When someone went LD, their name will be gone from the group list INSTANTLY! As a cleric, believe me that my attention is always fully FIXED on that part of the screen. Hence, that  makes Naguk so mad with you, as we saw your name still in group, yet you are not responding to our group say, begging ya. Beside, we sat in front of ya, checking if ya had the LD tag and keep begging ya till your char suddenly dissapear, hence the conclusion that it is a camp and not LD.<br>
<br>
3. Cyrrain was NOT in our group, he was there waiting as the next in list, hence he is a neutral party and can be more reliaby trusted than group member, which Naguk and Foxxer were and ya saying them not group members, as in this phrase &quot;Although 2 of them werent in it i guess they just decided to asy that. Naguk and foxxer being the 2.&quot; Ryched was a group member, but he choose to side with you, as he is a good FRIEND of ya, and thats where the information of you needing the FBSS for either your warrior Ziggenz or passing it guild leader to make him happy come from. But I think even Ryched wavers from the hard evidence shown. You must have short memory span or your name give us a clue, as you seems to talk about another event at another server, apparently.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nerric/Brannod, I am sorry ... I am sure Naguk, Cyrrain will side with me on this, as when we sat there looking at Crackie, there was NO other players beside the 3 of us. You must be either invis, or please provide the names of this &quot;A couple of us&quot; that was there too. And ... we were watching Crackie dissapear and the instant THAT happens I ask in ooc if I am truly shafted at that time, INSTANTLY, Caeill knows that. I am sorry, but I dont think my typing is THAT bad that it took me 5-10 mins to type an ooc, I think it was 1 or 2 lines of text ONLY.<br>
<br>
I am not saying that you are one of Crackie friends, but the truth is many strangers had been giving me tell, offering so-called consolations and compensation and strangely, a few tell later, they are revealed to be his friends, as I was just lead into a trap, like coming to a spot, with a train coming! I can tell you, that the ability of cleric to divine and gate, has saves my life many times on this, I am just this gullible, those who knows me must understand. And yes, I rez ppl when I can, yet they have used this trick to try to kill me too, so I am asking ppl to drag corpse to me now, yet the train still come, help me. I will NEVER be anno!<br>
<br>
Want a clue that your statement is in doubt? Everyone who has ever been in group will realise that MOST if not ALL the converstation will be in group say, and the congrats will be definetely on group say, there is NO other reason to say congrats in public, aye? People will be laughing at this hard prove, see? Dont treat me as enemy, not a personal attack, just my side of story, forget about this, thanks.<br>
<br>
And Crackie, I am still saying this, dont be so stupid! Lots of your friends/guildies has ask me about the case, and yet I told them that it was a misunderstanding, I am the one who is wrong, I apologise for making a ruckus out of it (I didnt in fact make a ruckus, ya did, as once I asked those questions in ooc, I camp, telling them to let it slide and forget about it, time heals everything, I am sure ppl who were present at lguk can confirm this). <br>
<br>
I am just trying to be nice, I want to give the impression to your friends that it was an honest mistake. Do you understand that I am saving face for you? Cause I feel bad that you got suspended, I know how it feels to addicts like us! I rather makes a person feeling bad owning me a favour than makes a person MAD thinking of me owning him a favour, see? You started it, now let it slide or you will be the one who suffer more in the long run. I am NOT your enemy, I DONT want to be, as in the 8 months time since I join, I got NO enemy, NOT even one, I am SURE of this. Get the point?<br>
<br>
People know this fact - when its a long camp, everyone will be tired and sometimes, the thought of ... I will be able to escape punishment with this 1st mistake ... will cross the mind. I am sure a lot of people will tell you when it comes to an item like FBSS, people WILL be tempted! If you dont forget about it, others wont, and who suffers in the end? You can provide logs/emails, yet people have already make up their mind, the evidence is just that hard to be cast aside.<br>
<br>
I hereby apologies to ya, I REALLY love chanters, all cleric DO.<br>
<br>
/em stares at %t in the face<br>
/em gives him a nod to catch his attention<br>
/em bows sincerely to make a statement<br>
/em tries to hug %t to erase the pain<br>
/em walks hand in hand with %t to watch the sunset<br>
<br>
PS the one at LOIO is amazing, anyone know other lovely spot?<br>
<br>
Hiya Parum, your guild is honorable aye? Blaizzen and Azzlano is my personal friens, that will give a clue. <br>
Oh yeah, I need the FBSS for my monk but I am willing to trade jboot for it, yes, I MIGHT get tricked in the AC ring hand-in process. Tboot will cost me hmm like 8k, cause of factions and charisma, so I will stick with jboot, I CANT win against those many KSer fighting for the AC. In fact Blaizzen tried to get jboot for 3 nights now, losing the OOT camp countless times to KSer and the sro camp to druids that can track, she might had given up now. A knights of virtue friend also brag that he can get in between 2-8 hours, yet he is too ashamed to even bring the topic up now. Aye, I had contacted Cynil/Muzyn, but his asking price is 10k, is he trustworthy? Thanks! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaeill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caeill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/14/01 3:04:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crackie not a scammer, just an honest mistake. =p</span><hr size=1> Well to defend myself on Crakie's alligations on stealing sage. Called camp check, sage open woohoo. Moved in, no one there, established camp. Someone came in there and said sage is camped, I don't see anyone around, camped now. Then the whole party moves from exe to sage and said it's camped. Now I know exe/sav/cav/sage is usually a camp but come on, that's just greedy. Anyways I argued the point because I was tired but instead yielded and let them have camp but I stayed until they were finished. And...if you ask anyone that was there they can say that I saved their parties asses once or twice on a monks bad pull. I was told the monk was insane too /shrug. If I wasn't there they certaintly would have died. Pet took out one by himself and I killed like 2 others out of a 7 or 8 froggy pull. Anyways sounds to me like Crakie is pointing fingers trying to get the attention on someone else, like the SK WHO STOLE SAGE! Riiiiight.  <p>Caeill K`Vor<BR>

Like i said they didnt bring up the logs and i have pleeded in email that they do.  3 people say they are in group, 1 actually was, say they saw me sit and camp.  They took your word for it.  It says it in an email when i asked if they had checked it out.  <br>
Caeill the group told you you could have another camp that they wanted sage and you ignored them and stayed in room anyway.  Would it not have been the right thing to do to give the people who had been there all night the choice of the camp they wanted to give up?    <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showMessageRange?topicID=117.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showMessage?topicID=138.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showMessage?topicID=143.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.emailToFriend?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.threadControl?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert>Scammer Alert</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
