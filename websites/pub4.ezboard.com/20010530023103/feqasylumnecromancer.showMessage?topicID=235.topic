<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    MoB Placement</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
MOST MoBs in Fear are Roamer types.  They don't roam the whole plane but a certain section of that plane.  IE:  The West wall ... North to South roamers on the wall, the South Patrol that Roams East to West on the South Wall.  The ONLY place that does not have a roam pattern is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    North</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the Fire Wall (the Amy Temple).  If you think of Fear in the 4 corners ... things split up nicely and it will begin to give you a basic grid of the MoB layout.  Note - that the MoB layout is slightly different than just 4 corners of different MoBs - but this concept will help you grasp the layout of Fear to a degree.<br>
<br>
In Reality a lot of MoBs are set up around specific landmarks.  The Following map is one of my favorites:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/mapz/fearplane2.jpg">www.eqmaps.com/mapz/fearplane2.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
It is not graphically pretty - but it is detailed - and the one I had to use when dragging 20 bodies to the North Camp once.<br>
<br>
So ... lets break it down like this ... North West Corner, Fetid Fiend House, West Wall, Graveyard, Yellow Tower and Boogy House (Includes the Sammy Building too), South East Corner, Frightfinger House, then the NE corner (not exactly corner - but close enough) which has the Glare Lords, Phoboplasm, and Nightmares, and last but not the least is the Amy Temple.<br>
<br>
Pulls are generally around these areas.  There are some things to note when Cazic is up.  When pulling Draco - or any of the Demigods (Fright - Terror - Dread) you are basically aggroing a 'PET' of Cazic Thule.  When that happens - a) the person who attacked the mob first gets DT (that INCLUDES an ENCHANTER that tries to mez it /snicker) b) all the other PETS (Demis) will start to head to your area - bringing with them a train of MoBs as they procede.  So if you are going to do Draco ... make sure that you take him in time - loot the goodies (that are not no drop) and camp.  Note - that ever 45 seconds Cazic will be DTing someone.  Tell people to get over their really cool sig and camp.  With Demis - have chanters mez the 2 Amy Knights - and kill teh demi quickly - and camp ... leave a Necro, Monk, or SK feigned at camp - to ensure that everyone is out or killed and they can /q out and come to chat and let you know that it is clear to go back in.  Why?  Cause some sk, necro, or monks FD and go afk - and they are in an agitated environment - and when peeps log back in - and they stand up - you will have the DT starting again.<br>
<br>
More on that later ... but for now ...<br>
<br>
I am sure other peeps have a different method to this - and any correction or addition would be more than welcomed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Starting Pulls</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
West Wall is broke - rezzes are done - mana is good.  Start North.  I will tell you this about the aggro here in Fear - it is FREAKIN HUGE.  If you think you are going to run up and judo chop a mob - chances are - you will aggro about 5 behind it.  Best way to pull - imo - is to run a little - listen (if you have sound) - watch carefully for movement - and move more - soon you will see about 1-3 things coming at ya in full force and you will have your pull.  Once you know the patterns - you will kinda know where to look for stuff to pick it.  I guess my big secret is my sound blaster live - and the fact that I have 2 subwoofers - 1 in front and 1 in back - and 4 speakers in front and 4 in back ... I really feel like I am in a jungle of sorts in Fear.<br>
<br>
To the North you will have the Fetid House - the North West Corner - the Tenticle Terror Bridge - and the Graveyard (though I am thinkin that maybe pulling the Graveyard around to the south would be easier in some regards - more on that in pathing).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Fetid House</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
In this house directly north of camp ... usually 4-5 mobs.  Usually all but one is a Fetid Fiend ... the other can be another mob - and lately have been things like WW (Worry Wraiths).  If you want a smoother pull - you will need someone to peel ... as you are going to pull the house.  Guinn mentioned something to me about levels and aggro radius ... and I know this to be true for lower level mobs - so I am thinking - that the higher the level - probably the less extra you will pull ... as only the mobs closest to you will pull.<br>
<br>
Pulling buildings is pretty much the same.  I would assume that you have a couple chanters - and 5 mobs should not be hard.  However - in the midst of confussion - these pulls that are usually controlable can result in hurt if peeps are not on their toes.<br>
<br>
So ... work your way to the house ... and they will come a runnin.  You can FD outside of camp - far enough for chanters who are up front to mez em - and have the primary pick em like apples of a tree.  Some of my first mistakes as a necro puller would be like running a mob into camp - bad idea (I see it still happen with monks even though) - or feign too close to camp (which I am still working on) but if you get it right - and work with your chanters ... you can have stuff outside the camp for the primary to pull.<br>
<br>
This is mainly with house or landmark pulls ... the roamers if you watch them ... you can get in onsies ... or twosies at the worse - no big deal. (Make sure you milk stuff in - cause pathing around the GY SUX - and you will get adds - more on that later)<br>
<br>
Once you get the house cleared ... your next objective will be the NW corner ... finish up them spids - apes and scares.  NOTE - as you are pulling from the north - try to stay WEST - near the wall ... as the TT (Tenticle Terrors) are close by - just east of the FF house.  Be on the lookout of the roamers from the GY to the East that come over to the Fetid House - and remember when pulling back to camp - to watch for these possible adds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    NorthWest Corner</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - extends north past the Fetid House to the North wall and from the West side of the fire wall to the West Wall.  Mainly up in this area you have Scares, Spids, and Apes.  Take your time and grab em 1 or 2 at a time ... bring em in ... you can keep a pretty healthy pace up and in reality - after the break - there shouldn't be a lot up here.  NOTE:  Don't go in through the fire - the Amys knights in the temple will aggro - and HT you - and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    IF</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you manage to survive (like say only 4 HT get you instead of 7-8 )  and you freak and run back to camp - chances are you will wipe out the team with a bunch of the temple.  Keep to the corner - and pull the temple last (imo - some peeps don't pull the temple at all).<br>
<br>
OK ... FF House and NW corner done ... breathe and get ready for the TTs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Tenticle Terrors</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
Pathing:  Note that this bridge and the one in the east are pains in the butt.  Yes - stuff can come through it ... but you practicly have to stand there and let it eat you.  One move away from the center ... and they will generally path back - and do some weird crap - and head south - and grab some friends from the GY ... and you will see all kinds of stuff just aggroing around in teh GY - and you will be thinking to yourself 'Hmm - I better not tell anybody'.<br>
<br>
A cool thing is though - you can get outside of the pull/aggro range - and stuff will leave you alone.  So it is possible to have the whole GY aggro on you - yet bring in onsies - twosies.<br>
<br>
The best pathing to pull stuff is to the NORTH of the bridge or to the SOUTH of the bridge - DO NOT PULL THROUGH THE BRIDGE.<br>
<br>
The inital TTs come easy ... only 1 or 2 will be boogers.  But your pull will probably be around 4-5 TTs.  NOTE - These guys DISPELL and love to use that Force Shock spell that throws you literally across the zone.  If your sow is dispelled - you know to bend over and kiss it goodbye for the most part (or FD and call for your friend to come peel)<br>
<br>
Some more notes on TTs.  In the old days - we would just do em.  I mean - tanks up front - loose buffs and swing away - and not rebuff until they were all dead.  What a hard way to do this.  Pimm suggested something he seen Seven Dreams do (I believe this is right - please Pimm help me to honor the right peeps) - and that was to Snare and Fear em - and fear kite them.  The buffs stay up - and the mobs die quick.<br>
<br>
If you don't do this here are some problems:<br>
A) Pets - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PETS TO BE DEAD HERE.  Them dang things Dispell and pets go buck - you have 4 TTs dispelling - you got 4 different pets on different mobs - the chanters are trying to mez - and the pets are breaking it - you are calming your pet down - but dispell goes off from another - and dispells mez from the one that the chatner just mezzed - it cast dispell and you pet is buck again and you got a whirlwind of Mez - dispell - pissed off pets.  KILL YOUR DAMN PETS - cause a chanters life is worth more than 2 bone chips or some stone. NOTE - this goes for Frightfingers with their Grav Flux - and Glare Lords (evil eyes looking things) that dispell as well.<br>
<br>
B)  Have the chanters out front ... with the Primary - tanks behind them - and casters in the back.  Get ALL TTs mezzed.  Then go from Left to Right - Snare and Fear the first one.  Have a designated SNARER that calls it out ... and a designated FEARER that calls it out.  Once the TT is Snared and Feared - have primary break mez - and let the fight continue - and Mr Fear person (generally a necro) keep it feared.  This will ensure a nice clean fight - with buffs up and clerics and chanters not wasting mana.<br>
<br>
Continue this pattern until all TTs have been pulled and the bridge is cleared.  Note - there has been like 1 roamer in the GY and usually there is always 1 TT in the temple ... so if the rangers are screaming - there is one more - let them know that the bridge is cleared ... and you will get to it when you do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Grave Yard</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
Ok - Note - this does not mean you pull the Gorgon roost - which sits on the east side of the GY.  This is mainly to clear the first few mobs.  The rest of the GY can be pulled from the south - and lead stuff south and around the hill to the west wall camp (but you will prob pull the Yellow Tower - Boogy House - and the WW Tower(what I call the Sammy house - cause more sammys than WW)<br>
<br>
Pathing:  Once again ... pathing is jacked.  There is no real way to describe each hill or dip ... each obsticle ... cause the mobs go this way and that way through the GY.  The middle ain't so bad as the edges - especially around the bridges ... but you got to see it to understand.  Just take your time ... and don't run too too fast - in case it back paths and aggros more ... milk stuff in and around.<br>
<br>
What is in GY - Toads - WW - Fetid Fiends - Amy Wars and Knights - Samhains (giant pumpkin head scarecrows) - and Gorgons - maybe a Boogyman or 2 (though they would be more east) maybe a TT or a frightfinger - maybe a glarelord (though not likely) some scares in the roam pattern.  Lotta random stuff.<br>
<br>
Gorgons:  These are the giant harypies.  The things druids drool over.  NOTE THIS - they have this uber stun.  Make sure your RM gear is on and that RM is up.  If they get their stun off on you - you will be almost if not dead by the time it wears off.  They fly fast - don't worry about loosing them - they are on ya.  These drop druid armor.<br>
<br>
Samhains:  Giant scarecrow - undead - I am pretty sure you can outrun these boogers ... drop Flux Axe for Rangers and Scare Straw - Necro research quest (LAME - the words drop already - but more power to the necro that wants to do the quest.)<br>
<br>
I will talk about the other mobs in the next section with pulling the South and moving  South East.</font><P><center>
