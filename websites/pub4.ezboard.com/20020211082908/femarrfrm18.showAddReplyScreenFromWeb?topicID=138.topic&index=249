&quot;Maybe there are, but I don't think you gave any.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well Arryen, you are a classic example of someone who believes what they want to believe.  <br>
<br>
Fallacies in your arguments : <br>
<br>
&quot;Why would you expect to find a LOT of fossils? There haven't always been six billion of us on the planet, you know.<br>
We haven't found a LOT of Tyrannosaurus Rex fossils but we know they existed. Similarly, fossils HAVE been found which suggest an evolutionary pathway leading to Homo Sapiens, but since we've only recently become the dominant species on the planet, there's no reason to think that our ancestors would be found all over the place.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Your assertion that homo erectus had not populated large amounts of the world are patently wrong.  Do even some superficial research and youll find that what is being called Homo Erectus was in Austrailia, Africa, Asia, and the middle east.  Some speculation exists over evidence of Homo Erectus in North America.  I don't think they really know what homo erectus was, even their varied samples of homo erectus are not the same creature.  More like bandwagon jumping from anthropologists who actually have distinctly different species they claim to be 'homo erectus'.<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides another fact that you ignore : Homo Erectus lived from 1.9 million to 400,000 years ago.  This still does not explain how Homo Sapiens appeared on the scene suddenly some 30,000 years ago, and what came in between.  Moreover, homo erectus has been found in the same geological strata as homo sapiens, indicating that homo erectus lived with or around homo sapiens.  This is just another example of problems with C-14 dating not jiving with geological information.  Archeaology is replete with these kinds of problems.<br>
<br>
The biggest thing I advocate is that people do some research on the conclusions people make.  A lot of the things we hold to be true wind up being patently false.  One of them being Neandertal man, now recognized as a human with a debilitating disease!  When I was in school, neandertal man was the 'missing link', now a good example of scientists trying to find evidence to prove what they believe rather than having open minds.<br>
<br>
But the simple fact is that most of the skeletons of 'homo erectus' have been assembled from parts from many different levels of geological strata.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Having failed to get financial assistance from the Dutch government, Dubois enlisted in the French Foreign Legion to gain his goal. While in Sumatra, he heard about a skull found on the nearby island of Java. He was able to secure the skull and even found another like it at the same location. However, these skulls were too human looking to be of any use to someone looking for an ape-man. In 1891, he found a molar tooth along the Solo river. Later the same year, he found another molar and an ape-like skull cap. The following year he found a human femur 46 feet from where he found the skull cap. Although at first he thought it was a chimpanzee skull, after consulting with Haeckel, he declared the whole collection to belong to one and the same creature, stating it was &quot;admirably suited to the role of missing link&quot;. &quot;<br>
<br>
Facts are always much more enlightening than assertions from self-proclaimed armchair geologists / anthropologists / politicians.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is considerable evidence that Homo Erectus is not a pre homo sapiens species, that in fact its remains were found in the same strata as homo sapiens.  This again becomes a problem for C-14 dating, because geological dating and C-14 dating seem to be at odds here.  <br>
<br>
<br>
The past 'missing links' is full of failures, some of them quite ridiculous.  Some of the past failures to find missing links :<br>
<br>
Homo sapiens neanderthalensis (Neandertal man) - 150 years ago Neandertal reconstructions were stooped and very much like an 'ape-man'. It is now admitted that the supposedly stooped posture was due to disease and that Neandertal is just a variation of the human kind. <br>
<br>
Ramapithecus - once widely regarded as the ancestor of humans, it has now been realised that it is merely an extinct type of orangutan (an ape). <br>
<br>
Eoanthropus (Piltdown man) - a hoax based on a human skull cap and an orangutan's jaw. It was widely publicized as the missing link for 40 years. <br>
<br>
Hesperopithecus (Nebraska man) - based on a single tooth of a type of pig now only living in Paraguay. <br>
<br>
Pithecanthropus (Java man) - now renamed to Homo erectus. <br>
<br>
Australopithecus africanus - this was at one time promoted as the missing link. It is no longer considered to be on the line from apes to humans. It is very ape-like. <br>
<br>
Sinanthropus (Peking man) was once presented as an ape-man but has now been reclassified as Homo erectus <br>
<br>
Homo erectus - many remains of this type have been found around the world. They are smaller than the average human today, with an appropriately smaller head (and brain size). However, the brain size is within the range of people today and studies of the middle ear have shown that Homo erectus was just like us. Remains have been found in the same strata and in close proximity to ordinary Homo sapiens, suggesting that they lived together. <br>
<br>
<br>
Your other arguments are similarly flawed from a severe lack of research and using 'knowledge' based on popular media of the moment.  If you don't have the time to do the research on the pros and cons of popular ideas as well as the validity of some of them, Im certainly not going to continue to do it for you.<br>
