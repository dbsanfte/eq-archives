 The funniest thing I can imagine is if the rest of the guilds in the rotation decided to start doing trak/VS jointly, killing them within an hour of spawning and just handing the drops over to whichever guilds turn it is.. Denying DG any shot at jack or shit. :P<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When DG joined the rotation, did they not agree to a rotation consisting or approximately 4 other guilds?

<br>
I'm not saying that this is why DG killed VS.  However, the top-end game is getting a lot more crowded.  There are probably 3 or 4 additional guilds that will be VS-capable soon, maybe more.  In fact, VS could probably be taken down by a pickup raid consisting of people who are not in the guilds in the current rotation.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying anything that should come as a surprise to anyone.  I think everyone knows that the &quot;old order&quot; on this server is under a lot of strain, and may not last.  Whatever you may think about DG, you have to respect Pyra's honesty in making the comment that is quoted above.  I'd be willing to bet that there are a lot of people in the other guilds that she listed who would agree with her comment.  I'd be surprised if any of them come out and say it, though.  Everyone seems to want to avoid this topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uayron01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ayron01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/13/01 9:12:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Grace announces new rotation policy on VS</span><hr size=1> The purpose of this post is to begin a constructive process of resolution.<br>
<br>
Now that the ranting and raving has tone down…we can work towards reconciliation.<br>
<br>
We must politely decline the constant goading and invitation by various parties who have posted on this board to engage in the verbal flame war and name-calling.<br>
<br>
Consequently, I must also apologize for disappointing those looking forward to a full rebuttal from Divine Grace, there will be none.<br>
<br>
We do not react immediately to taunts or baseless accusations, to do so will only lower ourselves to an unacceptable level.  That is a province for a separate category of commentators to this thread, whom we will not entertain.<br>
<br>
I will like to state for the record, that the reverberating silence from masses of Divine Grace members is certainly not from a gag order, nor a sign of weakness.  Instead, it reflects the Unified Spirit in which all members have chosen to stand behind our officers, whom we have placed our faith and trust on to resolve this matter in a disciplined, constructive and reasonable manner.  Without Unity we are nothing.<br>
<br>
Moving forward, we will discuss and aim for a harmonious resolution.  To this end, I will like to invite two responsible and matured officers from Phoenix Crusaders, to a meeting.  This is a process for reconciliation, we would certainly like to open lines of communication with  PC players who are matured, open minded, and keen to work towards a resolution, preferably Zacarius, Serafina and Bethanie who are personal friends. <br>
<br>
We must also firmly and irrevocably decline the participation of the following officers and members in the dialogue;<br>
<br>
Suzail<br>
Islington<br>
<br>
This invitation is extended only for those are matured from PC that will step forward and discuss the issues in a discipline and reasonable manner with an aim to resolution.<br>
<br>
And finally, we will also like to express our appreciation to the majority of Storm’s Fury, Midnight Sorjourn, Affliction and Magister for their silent support and non interference in this matter.<br>

Rotation points:  10 points required to get into rotation for trak/VS.  Once your guild gets 10 points you will qualify and get the next spot in rotation.  <br>

<br>
Probably not, if that was offered from the start.  But let's not deal with hypothetical situations, and instead consider what DID happen.  DG joined the rotation consisting of approximately 4 guilds.  A method for other guilds wanting to join the VS rotation was put in place.  It's not unreasonable to expect other guilds to eventually join.  Eventually other guilds joined and now the rotation is quite large.  Do any of the guilds on the rotation like it being so large?  Probably not.  But most of the guilds recognize that it's still better than FFA.<br>
<br>
While I do respect Pyra's honesty, the quoted area above really just continues to show how dishonorable and self-centered the mindset of the collective DG has become.  The courteous thing to do would have been for them to say &quot;hey guys, this rotation is getting too large for our tastes and isn't really what we had in mind when we originally set the rotation up, is there any way we can work something out?&quot;.  ANYTHING else would have been better than deciding to break the rotation (without bothering to tell anyone they were going to continually do it) because they felt it no longer suited their needs.<br>
<br>
DG has basically said &quot;we don't care about any of you, nor that you get your fair share.  We don't like the way the rotation is any more, so we're just going to do whatever we want to.&quot;  Even someone with half a brain can see how lame and anti-social that is.<br>

As for suzail, he is the most kind, cool, level headed, mature, and throughful shaman on this server. If you think he is a bad, it's cause you guys were poking him with pointee sticks instead of fruit. <br>

<br>
O and valric said this about suzail <br>
"Wow, that's quite some flame of mine to you Suzail. I didn't know you had such a fragile emotional state. What I said is basically true. You all are the ones that can't read." <br>

In that statement you called him fragile and said he can't read. Now if that's not a flame what is bro? <br>

<br>
Since you have asked for me, Ayron, here I am.  I do not intend to have any private discussions.  If this forum is not acceptable to you, we can meet elsewhere, but regardless any discussions we have will be logged and posted for all to read.  We have no reason to hide anything from anyone.  <br>
<br>
First I will restate the postion of the Phoenix Crusaders:  On the previous Venril Sathir rotation Divine Grace stole our turn.  When we approached DG for an explanation, apology, or discussion, none of these were forthcoming.  Because we are forgiving people, and understand that mistakes can happen, we let it go with the assumption that it would not happen again.  Now on this rotation, Divine Grace has done the same thing again and has informed us that it will happen again whenever they please.  We find these actions and this attitude unacceptable.  Until such time as Divine Grace proves otherwise, they will be considered dishonest, honorless and unworthy of any assistance.  <br>
<br>
Now, since you have asked for me as a friend, I will give you my personal view.  I have no friends in Divine Grace unless you repair your guild to the point where it is no longer a disgrace.  I feel that a guild is responsible for the actions of all of its members and all of the members are responsible for the actions of the guild.  It is a voluntary relationship and either party can break it off at any time if they feel the other is unworthy.  Please do not think, however, that I am angry with you personally.  This is not so and we can certainly be friends if you are in a guild which behaves in a civilized manner.  <br>
<br>
Now, as far as discussions go, I am willing to listen to what you have to say, but empty words will not sway me.  Promises and agreements cannot be made where there is no trust.  Divine Grace has broken our trust repeatedly, and solid proof of good intentions will be required to restore it.  <br>

Some shit went down, I had made my personal choice about who to believe and what to believe and I was gonna leave it at that. Ok, that was until Aryon posted and some other feelings in me came up.  <br>
<br>
The politics of this game gets pretty silly sometimes and I think this is a prime example: <br>
<br>
Obvious reason for Aryon's post: To attempt to make the matter an issue of being above arguing over a single spawn or a single event.<br>
<br>
The reasons why this is his goal can be guessed at.  The manner that he goes about this, however, is slick, and I don't think anyone with half a wit missed that.  <br>
<br>
You will ALL hate me for making this so long, but I gotta break this down, it was so well thought out, or maybe just good luck on Aryon's part:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Now that the ranting and raving has tone down…we can work towards reconciliation. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
...dismisses all previous discursive interactions as false and harmful towards the situation at hand.  It also begins the comparison of previous conversations to the conversation that Aryon (DG, he suggests) wants to have. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  We must politely decline the constant goading and invitation by various parties who have posted on this board to engage in the verbal flame war and name-calling. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
...begins the attachment of a negative connotation to the dissent voiced earlier. People criticizing DG want nothing but confrontation, and hence have no logical basis.  The phrase &quot;We must polititely decline&quot; continues to give the impression of civility and solidarity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Consequently, I must also apologize for disappointing those looking forward to a full rebuttal from Divine Grace, there will be none. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
...uses a nice glimmer of sarcasm, humor and stacato feeling.  The issue is inconsequential.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  We do not react immediately to taunts or baseless accusations, to do so will only lower ourselves to an unacceptable level. That is a province for a separate category of commentators to this thread, whom we will not entertain. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
...dismisses earlier accusations as uncivilized, without class, and unbased while markedly NOT denying any of them. The accusations require no response because &quot;we&quot; are above it.  Here we see the first hint of Aryon's de-authorizing of the &quot;commentators&quot; viewpoints.  That is, since these commentators are below the level of Aryon's viewpoints they have no authority to speak about the subject.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I will like to state for the record, that the reverberating silence from masses  of Divine Grace members is certainly not from a gag order, nor a sign of weakness. Instead, it reflects the Unified Spirit in which all members have chosen to stand behind our officers, whom we have placed our faith and trust on to resolve this matter in a disciplined, constructive and reasonable manner. Without Unity we are nothing. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
...DG is not weak because DG is unified and acts as one mind.  Totalitarianism is the term i think.  Again, Aryon wants to &quot;resolve this matter in a disciplined, constructive and reasonable manner.&quot; suggesting, yet again, that this was totally lacking from all previous discussion of the issue.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Moving forward, we will discuss and aim for a harmonious resolution. To this end, I will like to invite two responsible and matured officers from Phoenix Crusaders, to a meeting. This is a process for reconciliation, we would certainly like to open lines of communication with PC players who are matured, open minded, and keen to work towards a resolution, preferably Zacarius, Serafina and Bethanie who are personal friends. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ah yes, finally, there are now two kinds of people dealing with this situation: Those who are &quot;responsible and matured&quot; and &quot;matured, open minded, and keen to work towards a resolution&quot;.  Among those, are Aryon's friends, hand-picked with the idea that they will best serve Aryon's purpose (in the most general of senses).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  We must also firmly and irrevocably decline the participation of the following officers and members in the dialogue;<br>
<br>
Suzail<br>
Islington <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, and now, we have the formal de-authorization of these two people's opinions on the matter.  This is somewhat the climax of what Aryon is saying.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  This invitation is extended only for those are matured from PC that will step forward and discuss the issues in a discipline and reasonable manner with an aim to resolution. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A recap:  &quot;We&quot; want to discuss this situation only with those who have the &quot;matured&quot; viewpoint that these &quot;issues&quot; are beyond the event that occured and the accusations that have been made, furthermore, we would like to &quot;resolve&quot; these &quot;issues&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And finally, we will also like to express our appreciation to the majority of Storm’s Fury, Midnight Sorjourn, Affliction and Magister for their silent support and non interference in this matter. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Throwing in the assumed support of every major party outside of the two involved in this dispute will, of course, lend credence to &quot;our&quot; claims.<br>
<br>
Ok, enough quoting. I really could give two shits about this &quot;discussion&quot; or &quot;line of communication&quot; but I just really got fascinated by all the ways that Aryon de-authorized and dismissed everything that had been said previous and basically anything that anyone says except for those he considers &quot;mature&quot;.<br>
<br>
this is some classic propaganda, sorry, that was just fun to pick apart <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And just to piss Aryon off:  All my thoughts, opinions and interpretations of this passage are just that, mine.  In order for anyone to believe the passage I interpretted they must authorize the writer by acknowledging his viewpoint as correct, true, etc.  The same goes for my interpretation and there are people who will choose to give authority to neither (probably Valric).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sagemon>Sagemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/13/01 11:14:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DG </span><hr size=1> Just to be clear, Seredin, I'm not saying that Pyra's comment reflects the reason for why DG killed VS this time.  I really don't know what happened, and I'm not about to get into the middle of that fight.<br>
<br>
However, I suspect that Pyra's attitude is shared by a lot of people in the top guilds, in one way or another.  Just a few minutes ago, I noticed a post by one of the punk dragon farmers saying that he and his buddies want to start killing VS and the Kunark dragons with pickup groups.  Although that particular guy is clueless, at some point someone might actually be able to pull that off.<br>
<br>
I have a hard time believing that the top guilds would respect a rotation system that includes 20 or so guilds and several pickup groups of former Nagafen farmers.  If one of the top guilds needs something from VS or Trak, it's hard to imagine that they would wait patiently for two months for their next chance.<br>
<br>
Again, these comments are not specifically aimed at DG.  I'm just pointing out the stresses that are being caused by the rising number of 50+ characters on this server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uderilan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>derilan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/13/01 11:31:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> hehe and people wonder why not much has been posted in DG behalf, looks like a bunch of raving fuckwhits were ready to jump on and beat off in the matter as soon as something gets posted. <br>
