The annual feast of the Six Hammers was beginning at sundown and each of them eagerly anticipated the release from the drudgery of constant selling of the scribed parchments, if only for an evening.  Lumanti loitered outside their guildhall briefly to enjoy the eagerness in their squeaking footfalls as they shuffled off into the snow of the now-brisk streets of Halas, a promise of a hard freeze blowing in the gusts of wind that reached down amongst the buildings and swept away the diverging trails through the dry snow in but a few minutes.<br>
<br>
Lum left his observation post and began to move in a manner he hoped was seen as blasé, down the street as he breathed deeply of the city, enjoying the scents so different of those in warmer climates:  Here a tinge of husky (or was it polar bear?), a waft of an ice-caked gnoll fur cape on the stealthy fellow following the bank wall, and a bit of wood smoke from a communal fire in the street.  This city was unique in his travels throughout the world of Norrath.  It was vibrant in the face of the constant, dragging weight of the frigid climate.  His cloaked and swaddled face allowed a brief smile as he considered that those of the race others call Barbarians reflected the rigors to the climate to which they seem inured:  They were cold in their vast expanse, yet to their friends they were as warm as the mead hall to which Lum now arrived.<br>
<br>
The pub was well-lit by the standards to which Lum was accustomed, most of the other races in Norrath preferred the lower lighting levels appropriate to those who had the benefit of a wider visual acuity.  Here the raucous room of large humans was kept warm by a raging fire in the central pit and ample lighting from torches around the perimeter.  As his eyes adjusted from the brighter light of the outside to this darker surrounding, the discussions and jovial camaraderie of the large room dropped in brief but discernable waves, ending in total silence.  Lum heard the sound of melting ice from a cloak hung on a rack to his left, the drops of water splashing into a puddle below.  Obviously, other races were not frequent visitors to the mead hall of Halas, the home of the Shanks.<br>
<br>
One of the hallmarks of any master is to know what are your strengths and what are your weaknesses.  Lumanti Polyglot was a master of the politics of cross-cultural relations, and he knew it.  If he had chosen to serve his home city and had been born of a higher caste, he had no doubt he would be an ambassador of some consequence.  Instead, he had chosen the life of an adventurer and with it the rigors and joys of travel to mysterious lands like the city of the Northmen.  He also knew he was not the physical equal of the smallest of the powerfully built men and women his now-adjusting eyes could see.  This, he perceived, was his one and only moment to make the all-important first impression to a large group of very powerful people.<br>
<br>
Reaching up, Lum unwrapped his swaddled face with appropriate drama, keeping his face in shadow until he could reveal himself to the room all at once.  Then, picking up his chin to meet the firelight he smiled, his perfect ivory teeth shining out from his ebony face like a beacon that brought his considerable charm to bear on the room.  His mind switched with light strokes upon his brow as he ceased speaking the common dialect of all human races and assumed the bonny waves of the tongue of Halas.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings, gewd gentles, awhl.  I be alookin fer soom passing gewd mead fer a fortnight, boot it seems none is to be had south of yer faire city.&quot;  Lumanti chuckled, shaking his head in obvious disappointment.  &quot;However, I hear it said dat de brew of Halas has noo equal in all of Norrath and I be askin yer indulgence for me tew be joinin yew this evenin fer a coop tew ward off de cald and tew share a bit oof intelligence tew ye concernin' the encrouchement oof de darkies in de lands joost south oof the wastes, in Blackburrow proper.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lumanti could see throughout the brew hall now, his Erudian eyes finally adjusting to the entire tableau:  The apprentices of the guild were sizing him up, one or two of them moving quietly, but not silently, towards the shadows of the entryway behind him.  These he discounted, he trusted fully that it was the journeymen members that stood guard outside that now awaited at his back, steel silently unsheathed, for the signs of the masters against the back wall as they considered the black man before them.<br>
<br>
It was a huge man in the attire of a shaman that was to speak first, his low voice rumbling the very flagstones of the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye speak passing good northern tongue, milord.  But methinks ye try too hard to hard for the speech of the backcountry.  As you are a blue-blood, we shan't injure ye.  But I must say tis a ...strange... Erudian that braves the lands of the north countries.  It is no place for one of your... slight build.&quot;  The huge shaman guffawed to the lady across from him and Lum thought he might have seen the giant's eyebrow facing away from the door raise slightly to her.  Try as he may, Lum could not keep the slight blush of embarrassment from his dark visage.  He would definitely receive much value from using his language skills amongst these warriors.<br>
<br>
The apprentices roared with laughter and slapped Lum on the back in welcome, raising a few welts and bruising him for days afterward.  Lumanti could just hear one journeyman as he or she sheathed their keen edge with a professional air, a move he was convinced was to make a point of their inferred threat that assumed he did not know they were behind him.  He felt the slight gust of outside air as they returned to their duties outside.  Finally, he could see from the corner of his eye that those masters in the back would not invite him to their haven against the wall, nor did the two guards move from the door leading to the back room.  After making some introductions, the apprentices spoke of their own travels and then finally returned to their cups while stealing glances of the dark visitor with the keen interest of those who had never seen such a sight.<br>
<br>
He could stay.  He could speak with the apprentices.  He could pass his message.  He could have his cup.  Then he could go.  Nothing more was offered or asked.<br>
<br>
It was a huge man, even by the northmen standards of this pub and toting a two-handed sword in a backsheath that sought out Lumanti concerning his message.  No apprentice he, Lum judged by his equipment.  There was no doubt this was the chosen intermediary to those in the far room.  It was he that, Lum thought with a brief flash of the ridiculous, broke the ice.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, milord Lumanti Polyglot...,&quot;  the warrior stopped abruptly, turning his head slightly, &quot;Strange name, is it Erudian?  What does it mean?&quot;  Lum smiled outwardly as a warning flashed in his head-- this was no stupid tank, all bulk and no brain.  This hulk was completely capable of the art of negotiating and the verbal equivalent of the martial arts of the Monks of Quellious.  This was not a man to underestimate. <br>
<br>
Lum considered the suitably direct question cloaked in a harmless question with appreciation, his negotiation skills alert.  &quot;Tis a family name.  I am shamed to say it is neither a common nor an august one.”  Lum chuckled at his own pun, “My family is poor and I am the fourth of four children.  My surname is of an ancient language, rarely spoken in the lands of Norrath.  It means many-tongued, as I have endeavored to learn the dialects of all the speeched races of our world.  With that knowledge has come some understanding and some heartache.  Like that which I have learned happened in the land of the gnolls not a week ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As I have heard, milord,&quot; the giant leaned back in his chair, the wood squealing in rebellion, &quot;Perhaps you could enlighten me on what you have heard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, my friend, it was ghastly,&quot; Lum began, &quot;A darker, more inhuman act have I never seen.  A human bard had teamed himself with two trolls in the gnoll lair and they proceeded to kill all that lay before them.  As he was a blue-blood, no other human dared touch him, even as he played his healing and attack song for the trolls to hear.  Many elves, small persons and humans fell before them and the bodies of the dead were piled high about the entrance.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior's neck muscles worked furiously, trying to contain his rage.  The resulting effort made his face flush with hatred.  While the apprentices around the two speakers continued to get drunk, oblivious to the efforts of their guild superior to quell his anger, Lum noticed those on the back wall nonchalantly placed their hands on their weapons as if merely resting them between gesticulations.  This was the moment of dire danger for the visitor:  one misplaced word, one ill-considered facial tic and the giant before him would erupt in a wrath that would sweep away Lum and the apprentices long before more considered and experienced Shanks could intervene.  Lum watched with the detachment of one whose fate is firmly out of his hands and into another's.<br>
<br>
His unnamed compatriot's face began to clear, his breath coming first in gasps, then slowing as he recovered from his brief asphyxia.  Lum saw the question in the warrior's face and continued.  &quot;The inhuman's name was Finaron and many now hunt him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; said the giant, &quot;I care not for the killed freaks, the shorties and elves.  They are but a scourge upon our land.  I earnestly hope that their blood feeds the worms that inhabit the gnoll home.  But a blue-blood, serving with the hell-spawn trolls, THAT is unacceptable.  He has passed the line of what has been considered acceptable behavior and enow is but a heinous pig.  But, as you must well know, our honorable guild does not seek out to punish those humans that become renegade.  We do not hunt our own.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are correct, milord,&quot; said Lum finishing the dregs of his mead, enjoying the last vestiges of his cup and contemplating that those who had mentioned the high quality of the northern brews were absolutely correct, &quot;But perhaps the renegade Finaron might someday try to group with a Shank, and if so he might be shunned for his actions now they have become known.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, that may indeed be so, milord Lumanti.  That will, of course, be a decision made by the our leaders, in council with our own sources.&quot;  The warrior stood and contemplated the frail-bodied man before him as the latter finished bundling himself up from the now-frigid world outside.  He wanted to find out more about this person, this stranger from the far lands, this traveler of the fighter's blood and yet so different.  Alas, Wotan had warned him not to do so.  &quot;Fare thee well and good hunting, traveler.  Perhaps someday we shall meet again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for your kindness and the excellent cup, milord,&quot; Lumanti said, leaving his face still unwrapped, &quot;I wish you the same.&quot;  Lumanti gave a quick glance to the mighty ones in the back of the room and passed a brief nod of thanks, which was returned with the same grave and oblique manner.<br>
<br>
&quot;One more item before I step outside milord,&quot;  Lum said over his shoulder has he opened the door to the world of ice and snow, &quot;Finaron was a member of a guild known as the Coalition Defense Force when he committed these hellish acts.  When the leadership of that guild discovered what he had done, they immediately stripped him of his membership and placed him on their kill-on-sight list.  Apparently, their code is to honor what they consider the light races and defend against the predations of the dark.  I imagine that Finaron's actions were as horrific to them as they are to you and were by no means sanctioned by them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lum decided to not stay to read the face of his fellow negotiator; he did not want the warrior to have enough time to consider what was said while Lum remained in the guildhall.  Stepping outside, he turned away towards the cold and raised his voice, &quot;Be well milord.  May you and your people prosper in this land of yours.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Lum finished wrapping his headwarmer as he walked down the street in the biting cold, turning towards the ferry leading out of Halas and the strange, unfrozen lake it served.  As he stepped upon the snow-covered timbers, he looked up at the stars shining in the clear, frozen air and pondered his mission, now accomplished.<br>
<br>
He had come to acquire knowledge of the shamen of the north and to taste the fine brews of their hands.  The northmen's work was well worth his travels.  As the ferry reached the far bank, Lum jumped lightly upon its icy bulge and continued on his walk to the city's entrance, his ears straining to pick up the sounds of those who may be following.  He was sure no one had accompanied him on the ferry, using the arts of magic or stealth to hide themselves.  He was reasonably sure now that the leadership of the Shanks was satisfied with his ostensible and true reasons for visiting their guildhall.<br>
<br>
Stopping to think, his mouth curved into a slight smile as he backed himself against the wall.  He had no doubt the huge shaman's drinking partner could easily slip behind him if she had the desire and respect required he remember her in his actions as he left the city.<br>
<br>
Respect.  Ah, now that was what Lum came out the hall with that he hitherto had not owned.  Lumanti had seen the efficiency and leadership in all the subliminal interaction in the hall.  This was a controlled, organized group of warriors, not the wide-eyed crazies he had expected to see.  It had been an error to underestimate the Shanks because their warriors did not speak as they slaughtered their enemies, did not seem to have reason for their rage at the other races.  The brief time he spent speaking with the apprentices had given him enough information, predigested as it was, on the hatred that was engendered by the trepidations of the other races of Norrath.  Lum filed the thought away for further consideration as he brought a cloak of invisibility over himself with a few deft, well-remembered gesticulations and words.<br>
<br>
Stepping through the entrance of the city of Halas, his invisible form morphed dramatically.  Lum became even more slight of build, his eyes turned from brown to green, his bald pate was replaced by a shock of white hair and a small goatee, his ears flared upward and his skin faded from chocolate brown to an incredibly pale shade of white.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; thought Lieutenant Lumanti Polyglot of the Coalition Defense Force, as he finished sweeping his arms to open the gate to Fiorona Vie and stepping through, &quot;respect of the Shanks is something I needs must consider MUCH more deeply.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Lumanti Polyglot,&quot; she mouthed to herself.<br>
<br>
There was something odd about that Erudite. Though, perhaps she thought that because of his initial speech.  The learned Erudites she had hunted with had never attempted such a tongue, knowing it was in rare use amongst the Northerners in this Age.<br>
<br>
The Erudite had spoken of another, a Finaron who had proven himself a traitor to his race. This was not something to be taken lightly and the words were spoken with the confidence of truth.<br>
<br>
A matter for the Council definitely.  And perhaps a discussion about this guild who had kicked him out. Coalition Defense Force. She and her kin had heard of them.  Perhaps more would be revealed at a later time.<br>
