Waiting for AD to try and kill him AND THEN taking the spawn when they failed (because he will despawn).... i fail to see how this is not respecting?  Not respecting would be for us to walk in... say &quot;@#%$ you&quot; and killing him the moment he poped all the while making sure we had an xp group of rogues, wizards and the cleric to loot the piece.  <br>
<br>
Just sitting in the zone waiting is NOT disrespecting anyone.  The disrespect started when AD started badmouthing everyone in the zone, because they felt threatened.<br>
<br>
People's analogies of not respecting camps is stupid.  If you have enough force to kill raster when he pops, then he is yours.  it's the same w/ any other spawn.   We don't acknowledge someone  standing alone at the village in VL, shouting for a group YET claiming that the village is his.  He doesn't have the people to camp it.. and if you came along w/ a group, you would be rather resentful not being allowed to kill there because one person was sitting there saying it is his, when he has NO other group members.<br>

<br>
With regard to the time that AD were in SF camping RF - I can confirm that this was started sometime on Sunday as stated, as late on Sunday afternoon (bearing in mind we are GMT) Pooks first mentioned to me that Alderac was doing RF and he had sent him our best wishes.  Throughout his camp we sent him well wishes whenever we were online - and everytime we checked he was STILL in SF.  So as to all the confusion about exact time - I hope this clarifies this matter up.  <br>
<br>
Personally, after 3 days without sleep on my 5th and luckily last RF camp, I couldn't even tell you what day it was let alone how long I had been there - and I know that this was true for other people who had camped the duration with me.  Heck if he hadn't spawned when he did I am pretty sure I would have started thinking the computer was talking to me or something... Lack of sleep does that to you - it makes you quicker to anger and less aware of time passing.  Well it does me, I don't know about you all.<br>
<br>
As is probably aware my last camp was quite a nasty one - yes we rolled and luckily we won, but it doesn't alter the fact that a kind of agreement had been made but there was the ever present threat that he would be KS'd from us.  This is ALWAYS in the back of the clerics mind throughout this camp.  When the guild you have rolled against and won turns up again (Thank you Anlah'Shok - I only ever had well wishes from you guys after the roll) you wonder in the back of your mind are they deciding to renege (sp.) on the deal and take the kill after all.  That may not be their intention but you sure as hell think it.<br>
<br>
The server is obviously split over whether this is a camp or a FFA - whichever side of the fence you are on, courtesy and politeness should not be forgotten.  I personally was told in tells that I was being rude for not agreeing to roll on the camp after another guild walked into the camp - and this continued for a while (another point being it was NOT the cleric who wanted RF either).  Personally I chose not to talk to anyone other than the clerics involved while there - this may be a good course of action to be honest.  Tempers are heated and things are said in the moment.  I know things were by ALL parties at my RF camp.<br>
<br>
With regard to the comments that the camp would be respected IF there was force there capable of taking RF.... At no time has it ever been in disagreement that AD had a raid force there throughout the camp.  Therefore, why am I constantly seeing that &quot;IF they had a raid force there we would have respected the camp&quot; when it quite clearly was not.  If you feel it is a FFA stick to your guns and stick up for your convictions as Raijin did (which I respect although I do not personally agree with him) - there is no right or wrong side to this camp - just personal opinion.  As for not respecting being walking in and saying &quot;@#%$ you&quot; and killing him the moment he popped - well that is what happened to me on my 4th camp and to a dear friend just last night (who's guild were there in force and about to engage) and just brings forth the whole messy nature of this camp.<br>
<br>
I personally do not ever feel that this matter of RF will be sorted, mainly due to the fact that some people on our server have little or no respect for other players.  Maybe they think that there is no-one behind those characters - think again.  Every single person that is KS'd from RF, Raster or whichever camp feels the disappointment and upset.  All we can hope is that we do not lower ourselves down to their level or as was said earlier, what would this server become!  I certainly know that it would no longer be a place I would care to spend time in a game that I should enjoy playing.<br>
<br>
On another note - yes the epic is of use in raids (invaluable if you will when wiped out by AoW for example - still laughing bout that one - Sorry Rimm) but more importantly, my epic means that I can instantly res people. I feel that I am like the vast majority of clerics on our server - I do a /who all &quot;PlayerX&quot; when I see a corpse that has a res timer on it and shoot them a tell asking if they want a res.  No donations accepted nor expected.  This is what my epic means to me.  No wasting of mana or having to mem spell - send the tell and res inc.  Nice and easy and appreciated by the player you res (well almost always - there are always those that expect it and also expect you to stand and cast Aego on them and their group because you can).<br>
<br>
I am really sorry you didn't get RF Alderac - you are one of the good guys and really deserved to get him (and no I am not saying the other cleric did not deserve their epic before I get jumped on).  All I can say is that it is worth it in the long run and yes, epic the correct word for it - I added 20 played days on Smilin to get mine (but then I was unlucky on a lot of the spawns).<br>
<br>
Well that is my 2cp on a subject I, along with a LOT of clerics and their friends, feel strongly on.<br>

<br>
You guys weren't just sitting back and waiting to see if he spawned and we failed, many of your members were being aggressive and moving in.<br>
<br>
And Raijin, you're an idiot. we were there with a huge force to take him, you knew for a fact that if he popped AD would have taken him down before your 2862863 manaburn wizzies could move in and take him. Therefore, the only reason you had for being there was to annoy and anger us. You were way too eager to tell us you had 6 manaburn wizzies on call too, you could have very well said nothing and pulled them to surprise us, you just wanted to be annoying. It's like Freezingfists auctioning over and over that he has a Fungi Tunic for salke for 150,000 plat. He did it to annoy others in the auction channel, because there was no way in hell he would sell it for that price. (sorry Freezing, the situation fit :P )<br>

<br>
  If any AD members post after my post you will be looking for a new guild. no excuses.<br>
<br>
  I am the Guild leader of AD. i have not posted on here yet becuase i hate R&amp;F posts. But i want to put an end to it, atleast from my guilds perspective.<br>
<br>
   To all involved in the Ragrefire camp i apolagize. i was not there from the begining and came in in mid war. I am not going to say who was right or wrong for being there becuase indeed it is a FFA camp. <br>
   Yes tempers in my guild have gotten out of control and tempers in other guilds have as well . And i realize that most of it started becuase of the way my guild acted in SF. And for that i apolagize. I did not know of all the nasty tells that were floating around, i did not know of the threats people were casting out. But i did infact try to deal with it when i arived. But the damage had been done . peoples feelings were hurt and people were already enraged.<br>
<br>
    That night was a nightmare. i would like to move on past it and i have instructed my guild to do so. I have a few friends in PC and a few in Greylords. I would hate to lose them friends over a stupid incodent gone to far. and would like to ask all parties involved to stop please. From my guild stop the threats and bad mouthing. If at any time we were in the right the way we have acted here has put us in the wrong . For everyone attacked by my members i wish to apolagize to you and make it known that my guild is not a bad guild. we may be rough around the edges in a few ways but that is just becuase we are a young guild. Small no we are not a small guild .. but yes we are a young guild . And mistakes will be made. <br>
  <br>
   So i have come here to ask all guilds and people in question to accept my apolagy for the actions of my members. I am not saying my guild was wrong in SF but i am saying the way the situation was handled is wrong. <br>
   <br>
   If anyone has any issues with any of my members in game please send a direct tell to me. ie. any threats or nasty tells concerning this or any other situation. I am triing to make AD a up standing guild on Emarr mainly becuase everyone told me it could not be done this far into EQ. I made my guild for friends to play the game with friends . all set to strive for a common goal. with the same out looks and ambitions. So i ask everyone to plaese not look down upon my guild for the actions of a few people in it. those people who have done wrong will be delt with. Well the ones in my guild atleast. <br>
<br>
  Now i realize you will all attack my post. for my spelling or my paragraph formation and punctuation. Go for it LOL. i know i am not the best with words or paragraphs or so on. but please get the meaning of my post and do not attack my lack of grammer skills. <br>
<br>
   If ANY Ater Draconis members posts show up on this board after mine you will be guildremoved the next time i see you in game. So do not take this as a threat it is a promise.<br>

<br>
You made me post here again. This time I do in respect of you and your guild. <br>
<br>
In GL we try to settle any arguing in tells, not in ooc. The world in RL or on EQ is never black and white. Grey is our colour and to see the world in grey means to try to see things from both sides. <br>
<br>
The public arguing has hurt us a lot. Today when I entered a zone, I got a tell from a player I never spoken to before. He was asking me if I was there to KS like we GLs usually do. <br>
<br>
For over two years we have had more than 100 players out there. We cannot claim to be an uber guild, nor can we claim that a GL never have made mistake or done anything wrong, but I can say that we have always tried as hard as we could to do right, and we have probably been harder than most guilds when it comes to deguild anyone that could not behave.<br>
<br>
To move players into the zone is easy to interpret as a threat.<br>
<br>
I do not blame any AD player to become upset about that, but I feel very sad about the public flaming. Send a tell, and you will find that a GL is very easy to deal with.<br>

See you in SF!<br>

Maybe we even will take him down together. Who knows?<br>

That was a classy post, and I salute you.<br>
<br>
I am only one elder in PC so I can only speak for myself, though I honestly believe I am echoing the sentiments of others who will likely post here in a similar vein in the coming hours.<br>
<br>
None of us has relished the attention this episode has gotten, nor do I think any of the parties involved believed what they did was ethically in the wrong.  The point is, though, that nothing can be changed unless we all learn from what has transpired.  And, I believe, many involved on all sides have learned a great deal so that chances of these parties being involved in this again will be greatly reduced.  (Will this type of event happen again over RF?...Heck, yeah, I can guarantee you it will...probably on the very next spawn..but I bet you won't see these 3 guilds snapping at each other over it. LOL) Actions, however rightly conceived, can have drastic side effects that none ever imagined, and this was probably one such instance where that was proven true.  <br>
<br>
There has been a lot of talk on these boards about PC having lost its honor.  There have also been a lot of attacks from players who either left PC or were removed from our guild.  It is easy to bash and complain about a problem when you are not actively trying or care enough to be part of the solution, I guess.  I realize it is easy to think that they be right, and I can only refute their positions with this:  <br>
<br>
The PC internal channels have been full of nothing but talk about this since it first came up....what we did right, what we did wrong, what the other guilds did pro and con....how we could have done better, how we can avoid it in the future...and of course, many discussions about the different perspectives the server has overall with regard to RF.  All I can ask is that you consider IF PC is now so corrupt and bereft of honor, why have we been so dealing so intently and internally with these issues instead of gloating or posting &quot;in your face&quot; messages that some seem to have anticipated?<br>
<br>
Why?  Because the honor is not dead and it will never be, regardless of what some individuals may baselessly believe.   Yes, our numbers have swelled over the past few months, and yes, some bad decisions have been made in the heat of the moment.  Yes, we've had to eat some crow that we didn't particularly enjoy.  I know I am sorry some of these things have happened, and I know others are, too.  But honestly, guys...rants to the point of hysterics are generally not an effective way to make your point.  I don't think there is any one person or any one organization out there that can say they have always done everything right FOR EVERYONE the first time and everytime thereafter. <br>
<br>
Being PC still remains a great honor for those of us in the guild, just as being AD or GL remains a great honor for you in those guilds.  Mutual in game respect is as important as it has ever been and I suspect that those watch the game closely (rather than these boards) will see developments that will bear this out.<br>
<br>
In closing, I just want to say again that I think your post was a great one, Bloodwolfe, and I thank you for it.  Regardless of what has been said by those outside our guild, know that PC is listening to you and admires the leadership you have shown.  Hopefully, we will meet on the field again one day soon and you will have similar feelings for us.<br>

After all this I was in a AE grp with one of your enchanters last week. I forget his name but he was an upstanding guy. He was very good at what he did. <br>

I am glad that we are able to put this behind us. I have decided to take a break from RF for the time being to wait for patches and such to die down. I wish you and your guildies all the best and good luck on RF.<br>

I haven't read every post about this.  Here goes...<br>
<br>
As bad as Verant's customer service is, what about if everyone who thinks that the Ragefire spawn or that something needs to be done about this spawn actually petition?  I'm not talking about a /petition Help!  Help!  I'm being repressed!  What if... say on the 8th of August at 4 PM Eastern time do a real petition.  Everyone voice their concern and flood cshome with real petitions that this spawn needs to be fixed... furthermore do it every week until they fix it.  I'd like to see the GM's face as he takes a peek at the qued petitions awaiting for him.  All twenty thousand or so of them.  Get your respectful guilds involved and have them all petition at the same time.  Would be very nice to have this petition across all the servers at the same time.. but I'm too lazy to organize something like that. <br>
<br>
As far as camping Ragefire.. most of the clerics in our guild pretty much decided to wait for the kids to go back to school before actually seeking him out.<br>

Of course you do.<br>
<br>
People are all often eager to point out a problem and complain.  But who here has a solution that verant could implement which FITS IN THE GAME.<br>
<br>
Wether people like it or not, EQ is intended to be a roleplaying game.  If Ragefire freaking handed you a ticket and said <br>
&quot;See you next Thursday for when you kill me&quot;<br>
<br>
Its not very roleplay like is it.  Good lord....<br>
<br>
Verant do not want lots of cleric epics.  ITS THAT SIMPLE.<br>
<br>
Its sad but true.  I dont neccisairly agree with it.  But hell, if they dont want lots of Cleric Epics knocking around....then they sure as hell aint gonna implement ANY way of making it easier.<br>
<br>
People can complain all they want, but NO ONE can give verant a legitimate reason for changing it.  Bugs, errors and imbalances with classes....YES<br>
<br>
A camp being to hard and long and causing antagonism? NO<br>
<br>
It aint your fault you cant camp it, it aint your fault its too long but people need to see it ISNT Verants fault that people argue over it.<br>
<br>
Its like people saying they should make alchohol less addictive somehow....the company would say &quot;Its your fault for drinking so much you became addicted, it wasnt INTENDED to make you an alchoholic&quot;<br>
