Before Peppe ebayed, he and his twink Sllim was given many items from guildmates to borrow. This includes, but is not limited to the possibility of more, Mithril Arms, Slime Coated Harpoon, and I believe a Serrated Bone Dirk. This is what Ketsui, Kaeyn, and I contributed to him... perhaps more was given.<br><br>Peppe has since Ebayed, but even though Sllim was a secondary of Peppe's character, he is a different account - I do not know if he was ebayed, or taken over by Xendrex (Peppe's brother). I'm thinking possibly taken by Xendrex, as he's Riders and now Sllim is riders.. plus he's known to be a dick. ;P<br><br>I was going to let this go, we lost items, they're only items which can be acquired again, but it's the way he has dealt with the situation. Kaeyn approached him asking if he could have his mithril arms back, I believe the response was (paraphrased here, but you get the idea) &quot;They're mine, you won't get them.&quot; Soon after, I did a /who all to make sure Sllim was online. So I see he is, he has a Riders tag, I drop him a tell. I ask him nicely for the return of my Slime Coated Harpoon. No answer. I do a /who all, he's not anon. I give him a second tell, asking him if he heard the first.. again, in a decent tone. This time he goes anon, completely ignores me. I give him another tell, a bit more firm this time, he completely ignores me yet again.<br><br>Bottom line: Sllim is not to be trusted. He is in posession of property which does NOT belong to him, yet he refuses to return it. What's more, the account has changed hands illegally. Whether by ebay or to his &quot;brother&quot; Xendrex, it was an illegal trading. Since the new Sllim has decided that he's going to screw over anyone he can, I've decided that I'll report his sorry ass every day that I can until something is done about it. Downright criminals like this piss me off to an extreme, and I hope that other players will petition Sllim as well to see that something is done. The loss of the items is minimal in the scope of things, but the truly painful aspect of this is that we now know Sllim is the type of person who will screw you over if he finds the chance.<br><br>Riders: I mention your name in this post because Sllim is a member of your guild. I don't blame the entire guild for the actions of one member, but I do bring the name forth so that hopefully the officers/leader will do something about this.<br><br>That's all, I've blown a lot of steam in this post. Next time you see sllim, please toss him a /gesture or two. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER><A HREF="http://sa.digitallucidity.net" TARGET="_blank" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click Here To Visit the Soul Assassins Web Site [Currently Under Construction]';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true"><IMG SRC="http://sa.digitallucidity.net/misc/arasig.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="- Aravorn" WIDTH="448" HEIGHT="91"></A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uorunleafstalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orun Leafstalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/3/00 11:23:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sllim (Wood Elf Rogue, Riders of the Apoc)...</span><hr size=1> Sllim also won the random on a crystalline spear MUCH to the dismay of the other two rogues at a Vox raid.

We hadn't spoken for ages, and he supposedly ebayed when I was on vacation from EQ... we were pretty good friends before he left. Xendrex has once professed to be the real life brother of Sllim (which Peppe/Sllim confirmed for me), and now he says that they are real life best friends - of course Xendrex doesn't have a clue about Peppe's email, nor would he offer to get it for me.<br><br>This weekend, I see that Sllim is online, I give him a tell... ignored... another tell... ignored... another tell, he goes anon and ignores me yet again.<br><br>Xendrex gives me a tell after the shitlist posting, we have a chat. I tell him that my belief is the Sllim account has changed hands, he immediately goes off on me, threatening to expose me for ebaying, saying that SA will be disbanded, etc. To add on top of this, he says that I deserve to be hurt for my &quot;stupidity.&quot; <br><br>Now, if I was mentioned on the shitlist wrongfully, and knew that it would remain unless I could prove it wrong, I'd be upfront with some facts. I'd give you that email address to contact the former owner of the account(s), I'd do whatever I could to make sure that the truth is known. Rather than doing anything like this, Xendrex chose to flame me, and make threats. I like this quote from Givin, &quot;Hmmmm....guilty dog barks loudest???&quot; <br><br>In my opinion, Xendrex took over control of sllim. He is being asked to return the items which were loaned to Sllim, but he does not want to do it.. so he's ignoring tells, he's tossing threats. As I said, Sllim and I were good friends... he wouldn't suddenly join Xendrex's guild and stop communicating with me at all. Sllim had borrowed items from me before, and returned them when I asked. The new Sllim is displaying the jackass tendencies that Xendrex has in the past... does anyone recall the raid in Karnor when Xendrex was in the game cursing everyone out and saying how much Lanys sucked, because he was going to move to another server?<br><br>Xendrex: Give me proof that I'm wrong, and I'd be more than happy to remove you from this post. Right now I have a list of reasons why I believe you should remain, but as I said, prove me wrong. And don't be so offended when I say that I'll report Sllim for ebaying... if he didnt ebay, and account hasn't changed hands, he has nothing to worry about.<br><br>MeanNecro: Sllim was a pretty good friend of mine at the time, and a guildmate, so I had no troubles lending him items. Why should I kick myself in the ass, because I was being generous to a friend and guildmate of mine?<br><br>Alnaron: You're a friggin moron, but thanks for the comic relief. <p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER><A HREF="http://sa.digitallucidity.net" TARGET="_blank" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click Here To Visit the Soul Assassins Web Site [Currently Under Construction]';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true"><IMG SRC="http://sa.digitallucidity.net/misc/arasig2.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="- Aravorn" WIDTH="448" HEIGHT="91"></A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unuvassa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nuvas SA</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/4/00 9:24:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is Bull Shit And I Have nothing to do with it</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This has nothing to do with me so BACK OFF....

This is a fact of EverQuest, and whether it's not the right thing to do as per the agreement, it happens in most guilds on most servers. I don't have a problem with this in most cases, so I won't go around petitioning every player that does it.. the GMs would ban me for flooding them. ;P I do, however, petition the characters who have been taken over by players who think it's cool to screw over other people. Sllim has in his posession items which do not belong to him, he's obviously refused to return any of it. Should a person like this not be exposed as the thief he is?<br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to clear that up. I'm aware of many people who play accounts they acquired from auction, friends, etc. I'm only going to make a stink about it if the new player has decided to mistreat others, in which case he has earned his spot in the shit list. I can't go out against every ebay, because it's going to keep happening as long as Verant sits back and doesn't do jack about shutting down auctions.   <p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER><A HREF="http://sa.digitallucidity.net" TARGET="_blank" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Click Here To Visit the Soul Assassins Web Site [Currently Under Construction]';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status='';return true"><IMG SRC="http://sa.digitallucidity.net/misc/arasig2.jpg" BORDER="0" ALT="- Aravorn" WIDTH="448" HEIGHT="91"></A></CENTER></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaravorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aravorn</A> at: 9/4/00 1:03:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upeppepinguo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PeppePinguo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/4/00 6:15:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sllim (Wood Elf Rogue, Riders of the Apoc)...</span><hr size=1> and there is only one thing left to say...<br><br>YOU DONT WaNNA FUCK WITH SHADY!....

Aravorn...3 tells and no response.  Obviously he didn't want to talk to you (can't imagine why).  Giving items to members is ok, but why ask for them back after you give them?  Even if someone did return the given items, the thought of not returning them would cross their mind.  And if they are like me, working on a series of impulses, they will promptly say NO! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=233.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=233.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=233.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=233.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=233.topic&start=101&stop=114>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showPrevMessage?topicID=233.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showNextMessage?topicID=233.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.emailToFriend?topicID=233.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.threadControl?topicID=233.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=233.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=233.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
