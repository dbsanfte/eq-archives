I have never flamed anyone on this board, or any other board for that matter, but you just really pissed me off.<br>
<br>
First of all, unless you can beyond a doubt really prove that I was talking about you in the other thread &quot;Top 10 losers/idiots/assholes&quot; you have no fucking ground to stand on. I said I wasnt, I wasnt. So shut the fuck up allready.<br>
But if you are so inclined to beleive so, well to fucking bad. If your feeling guilty about what was posted, then I guess the truth hurts.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I have not posted in the &quot;Mender, You pathetic tool&quot; thread and really have no interest in posting there. But if your slimy fungus covered ass wants to bash me, do it here you pathetic fuck, out in the open where I can see it, where I dont have to root around other threads that have little interest to me.<br>
<br>
 The only reason I went there was because someone told me you were there mentioning my name. If a pathetic low life, cum covered, gerbil breeding asshole such as yourself has to burry bashes directed to other people deep in someone elses thread, it re-inforces my opinions, and Im sure many others, about the truely spectacular whining shit bag you really are! <br>
<br>
Nuff Said!<br>

You are remarkably mature.  You also have a huge problem with facts and assumptions.  Here's what I said:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not foolish enough to make the assumption that mere order directs to which post a comment is made. Despite Darue and Dorkarm's nebulous claims to the contrary in the other thread, their comments were directed at me. As they are the same flames they've thrown at me time and time again, it doesn't take much analysis to make the connection.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the &quot;Mender&quot; thread, it was dnegel that raised the issue of the &quot;10 asshole&quot; thread.  I simply responded to it.  I have no interest in burying anything.  If you can convince anyone that you didn't intend your comments to be directed at me, more power to you and their conservator.  As no other comments aside from Dorkarm's flame of me make any sense in regard to your comment, your denials are rather transparent.  I wonder who tipped you to my comment?<br>
<br>
You've never flamed anyone on this board?  How fabulous for you!  It must be nice to be able to only recognize a post as a &quot;flame&quot; if it contains childish drivel and cursing.  As you've posted in lockstep with Dorkarm more than a few times in his flames of me, that claim is just as transparent as your others.  I've flamed some myself, but nothing along the lines of the childish banter of you and Dorkarm, just responsive comments to your foolishness.<br>
<br>
Why would I need to prove anything on this board &quot;beyond a doubt?&quot;  I simply stated the obvious interpretation, which you've yet to deny.  You've posted some illogical alternative targets of your comments, but they aren't likely.  You might as well have said &quot;I like Spam&quot; for all the sense those alternatives make.  As I've done before, I'll leave my observations to rest on their own merit.  If others take issue with them, fine.<br>
<br>
Oh.  Many others have the same opinion of me as you?  I'm so sad.<br>
<br>
Piss off foolish child. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udarueivywood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darue Ivywood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/10/01 4:39:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raedwolf this is for YOU!</span><hr size=1> So what I can gather from your relentless anal dribble is the fact the truth does hurt.<br>
<br>
Let me refresh your memory.<br>
If you bothered to actually read the post I just made you would notice that yes, I do deny it.<br>
&quot;I said I wasnt , I wasnt &quot;--I do beleive that to be a direct quote from myself.<br>
<br>
As far as flaming anyone else. Nope, cant say that I have. I merely comment on different threads and toss my opinions in where I feel. Nothing I have ever written in the past was even meant as a flame. This one, however, was.<br>
<br>
If you have no interest in burying anything, then why must you post deep into a thread about others that has no merit from the original? Why not start one of your own? or take it back to the original post? How many other 'secret' bashes have you had against people without them knowing about them? Does it get you off at night knowing that they were not able to reply to them because they had no idea they were there? Does it make you feel good because you got the last word in? Which Im noticing on most of the threads that seems to be your 'trademark'. <br>
<br>
I bet it does make you feel so damn self rightous knowing that the last word was yours. Its noticable in your wordings and your posts. I spose if I were in your shoes and had to live your pathetic meaningless life, and my hand kept falling asleep too, I would seek other forms of glorification / satisfaction also...<br>
<br>
 KUDO'S to YOU!<br>

Again, I must recommend that you seek professional help for these problems.<br>
<br>
Darue:  If that's all you can gather, then you are hopelessly out of touch with reality.  Although there may be circumstances where the &quot;truth hurts&quot;, this is clearly not one of them.  Regardless of the truth, don't accusations and incessant ranting like Dorkarm's cause others to get annoyed and respond?  How does a response indicate any veracity or power behind the accusation?  I wish it hadn't been so many years since my Intro to Debate class, or I might recall the name of the fallacy both you freaks keep trying to assert.  It really is comical.<br>
<br>
Yes, now that your foolish pseudo denials have been put to the test, you make the actual denial.  However, this is even more foolish than the others, for your claim makes no sense.  I recognized your new denial in my first comment in this thread, hence the &quot;Spam&quot; analogy.<br>
<br>
No prior flames?  Bull shit!  Your numerous fawning agreements with Dorkarm's crap amply demonstrates the lie to that claim.  Does he give you his left overs or something that you have to try and make him happy?  Is it only a flame if you have to resort to that junior high school level name calling?<br>
<br>
I didn't bury anything.  Read the fucking thread, moron.  &quot;dnegel&quot; commented on the contrary opinions in the &quot;10 asshole&quot; thread, to which I responded.  I posted at all because the war was entertaining, and Mender made a funny comment about Chuk I couldn't pass up.  It's not like I pulled it out of no where.  &quot;dnegel&quot; brought it up, and I responded.<br>
<br>
The &quot;secret bash&quot; claims are amusing.  Erroneous and foolish, but still amusing.  Getting the last word?  Rarely.  Dorkarm and Chuk live on this freak filled board, so they've pretty much done that alone.  They left one of my comments alone, only because I dared them to do so and let the thread die.<br>
<br>
Oh, wait.  I just mentioned Chuk.  I guess I ought to send him a tell that he got mentioned in a thread.  Oooo.  My bad.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I love it when immature folks like yourself claim others have pathetic and meaningless lives.  It's so rewarding to know that anything you consider meaningless, is probably the opposite.  You know nothing of my life.  It is neither.  Of course, any such statements on an anonymous message board ARE meaningless.<br>

As far as the last word thing, yea I read the whineplay boards, and at last count(I was bored at work)yours were more than half..yes thats right, more than half. If I remember correctly there were around 120ish posts..yours came around 70ish. So as far as the last word thing.. <br>
<br>
yep, did the math. <br>
<br>
Why dont you do us all a favor and go crawl back under that rock you came from...oh wait..I forgot, VI deleted that<br>
