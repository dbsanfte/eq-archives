<br>
Lets see a guild is in fear, waiting to see how long stuff will start repoping or if the gms will repop it cause of the server downage and you decide you will ENVOKE PNP .. <br>
<br>
Lets move on a bit, a gm repops the planes, Cazzic is up , 19 people are in the planes and you send 2 monks in , we ask you to stay the heck out and then you say in tells no we posted it on emarr board that we were raiding tonight so we are staying.. Let me fill you in on something .. YOU CAN NOT SHARE FEAR WITH CAZIC UP.. your members even stated you were fear newbies, what the hell were you thinking .. All we wanted to do is kill caz get some armor and get the hell out, and we could have done it , instead we got trained by your monks cause they didnt camp out when caz started death touching and we all died,.   After we got ressed you all still say you are coming in anyway .. <br>
<br>
Well let me put this nicely ...  If i ever find out that you are in pof or anywhere else that I want to hunt I will envoke PNP on you , and state that i planned it 100 days earlier on some board that noone ever reads and we will see how you like it , or maybe better yet, next time you are in fear we will come in and claim pnp of everything except the monkies.. <br>
<br>
I am frankly pissed off  to hell and back.. You all should know that making plans on the dragons and planes board does not entitle you to the planes, and you all should know that you cant share fear with cazzic up ..<br>
<br>
So far we have learned that <br>
<br>
1 Tunares guard will envoke pnp<br>
2. that planning stuff on the d&amp;P board doesnt mean shit<br>
3. that i hope your all lose your corpses on fear<br>
4. that your monks didnt know to camp out to clear agro <br>
5. that I will envoke pnp whereever you are no matter the camp and no matter what the loot is<br>
6. that if you post anymore plans on the board i will read them and set up a raid 15 mins before you port up<br>
7 that someone was offended when i said suck my balls in shout and petitioned me<br>
8 that i am not the nice person i was in khs<br>
9 that if you have plans always make backup plans<br>
<br>
Thank you have a nice day <br>

I don't know how many times we had plans for fear or hate or someplace else only to find someone else there, but ya know what?  WE HAD A FUCKING BACKUP PLAN.  We didn't storm into fear with CT up and get both ourselves and the other guild in the plane killed repeatedly.<br>
<br>
You bunch of dimwitted fuckfaces really need a lesson in common sense.<br>
<br>
Do you understand what CHAIN AGGRO is?<br>
Do you realize that Fear with CT is unlike no other place in norrath and CANNOT be shared.  <br>
<br>
Are you guys just that stupid that you would rather ignore the advice of experienced players and spend all night on a CR?  Like Elth said I hope your corpses are still fucking up there.  If you had to call in some other guild to help you I'm just sorry that I didn't have the time to warn everyone how ignorant you little shits really are.<br>
<br>
Invoking PNP on another guild in, of all places, Fear, is the fast track to the back of the short bus.  Have alternate plans, don't base your nights enjoyment around one single event.  I can count 20 other places a raid of your size could go.  Course you'd probably fuck it up and die there too.<br>
<br>
Thanks for an enjoyable evening of arguing, camping, and DT's.  We are SURE to pay you back some time.<br>
<br>
And ohh yeah, READ THE TOP OF THE FUCKING DRAGONS AND PLANES PAGE.<br>
<br>
Ass-spelunkers.<br>
<br>
Ogmuk, if you read this please think about pulling the Dragons and Planes board.  It is utterly useless and apparently the rocket scientists amongst us can't read the text at the top of it anyways.<br>

Well how about if I list what actually happened and let the others decide instead of coming off like a screaming lunatic. Oh and BTW, for a guild that professes NEVER to read the boards, you posted pretty quickly here. Guess its fine to ignore the raids thread, but not the ranting. Good sportmanship guys.<br>
<br>
As stated, we did post in advance (wow, imagine that the post actually has a date on it, so we can't claim to have done it 100 days in advance). I guess you do read the board and decided to be jerks and show up earlier than us. BTW, as planar professionals you claim to be, you couldn't make an effort to find out when the plane was last cleared? Or do you enjoy sitting in Fear for hours?<br>
<br>
When we informed you of this you told us you ignored this board and all the guilds that make an effort to post here. So then we offered to JOIN with you on a Multi-guild Fear raid. You told us to get lost - just to be greedy.<br>
<br>
We then informed you we would be coming up anyway so you asked a GM to re-pop the zone to keep us out. Very nice. Oh and BTW, with 16 people you cannot clear Fear and kill CT after the new patch. Another genius move on your part.<br>
<br>
Then you blame us when CT DT one of your members. Yep, we have control over CT. We told him to DT one of your group and aggro you guys. The first time you got wipped, we were camped out. Only our monk was in Fear and he had just camped back into Fear (imagine that, we use two monks). No aggro from us - you killed yourselves. The second time you died we were not even in Fear.<br>
<br>
Plus, as a guild we have not done Fear often. But many of our members have been there numerous times. So don't give me this newbie to Fear stuff.<br>
<br>
As for the PNP, I love your logic. It is the unwritten rule not to call that on the planes. Yet the unwritten rule of posting on the board is ignored by you. Well how about you write a list of unwritten rules you follow and once you get the 4000+ paying customers on the server to sign up to it we will listen. Otherwise, either follow all the unwritten rules - i.e. posting on the board - or none.<br>
<br>
Funny how no other guild tried to move in after we said we were going up on that date and time. Guess they actually make an effort to share the fun of the game with others. Imagine, everybodies $10 a month is just as good as yours. <br>
<br>
You wanted to be jerks, don't blame us. <br>

I dont read anything else.. and btw we were in fear about a hour and a half trying to figure out when repop is.. <br>
<br>
So find a pole and sit and spin man , cause i dont give a damn , we were there, you were not.. As to who ct death touches, yes your right you dont have control over that, but it is common knowledge when ct starts to dt , camp out cause somehow someone has chain agro, when your monks didnt camp out the agro stayed and when they stood up ct went on a rampage... Why would we want to have 40 people up in fear when we could do what we were trying to do with 19 ..makes sense doesnt it , to get gear for our guys and kill ct.. <br>
<br>
the unwritten rule to post on the boards is this , its actually written above it, it says Posting here does not reserve you the plane... <br>
<br>
Funny how other guilds saw we were up there and didnt come up , <br>
<br>
Actually I like being a jerk , i didnt want to be, what i blame you for is being ignorant of the way fear , planes and the game works...<br>

you want it , beat peopel to it.. pretty simple.. <br>

If it's not somebody from this board ignoring you and going there it'll be a guild who doesn't check the msg boards, or the asian or european guilds.  They beat you there, go do something else and try again some other day.  You say everyone's 10 dollars a month is the same and they have the right to enjoy it.  Then don't expect people to stay out of the planes just because you posted and they didn't.  Half of those fucking posts don't even get followed up on with actual raids because plans change and not enough people show up.  Shit happens, deal with it.  If you would have shown them some respect, then maybe they would have shown some in return.  Instead though, you moved in anyways and gave a bad name to you guild in the eyes of all who read this board.  Coordinating things in higher level raid type events is not about muscling your way in, it's about common sense and a basic sense of decency and respect.  Show some and it will go along way.

It won't die!!!!!<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;BTW, as planar professionals you claim to be, you couldn't make an effort to find out when the plane was last cleared? Or do you enjoy sitting in Fear for hours?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
For those who haven't BEEN to Fear before, like apparently YOU... after a server reset (can you say &quot;emergency patch?&quot;) Fear can repop on its own... without CT.  Or you can petition and wait for a GM to repop it, so you will have the God mob to kill.  When the plane was last cleared is... um... irrelevant when a server reset happens.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;We then informed you we would be coming up anyway so you asked a GM to re-pop the zone to keep us out. Very nice. Oh and BTW, with 16 people you cannot clear Fear and kill CT after the new patch. Another genius move on your part.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
And you know this from your VAST Fear experience?  There are several guilds on this server, just FYI, who can clear Fear with FEWER than 16 people, perhaps bringing in reinforcements for CT.  Asking a GM to repop it isn't directed at you (though that knowledge might be a massive blow to your ego)... it's to get a CT spawn.  And from everything I've heard (dunno, we didn't try to invoke PNP on the guild that took Fear after the emergency patch, go figure) I haven't seen that the Hate/Fear changes have gone live on production servers.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;As for the PNP, I love your logic.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Me too.  You don't even acknowledge that your own officer apologized for your actions in horrified terms on these message boards.<br>
_____________<br>
<br>
Bah!  I wasn't even involved in this, I generally stay out of crap like this... but I'm bored, it's cold and raining here IRL... I can't play my main in EQ until a bit later because she's stuck on the seventh island of freaking Sky looking at her keys that will poof if she leaves (THANKS VERANT for this WONDERFUL zone, and your WONDERFUL emergency patch), but:<br>
<br>
a) Eltherion is a fellow resident of Georgia and must be supported; and<br>
<br>
b) Isn't there enough BS going on in this game without insignificant crap like this? <br>
<br>
On the other hand, people plastering their ignorance in black and white IS funny.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Annoc is an officer in TG, unfortunately he was not there nor talked to any of us before posting here. Being a kind soul that he is, much like most of us, he made an apology not to ruffle feathers. <br>
<br>
From the beginning of this episode we asked politely to join you in Fear. To be part of your raid. We felt we were in the right because we posted here. You felt you were in the right because you got there first. Fine, we accepted that and asked to join you. Not once, not twice, but many times. Even after the first time both our groups died we asked again to work with you and have an enjoyable evening for both our guilds. Once again you refused. Obviously, you can argue it was your right to refuse, others can argue you have the obligation to allow us to join you.<br>
<br>
We were stubborn in our insistance to go to Fear and you were arrogant in your insistance to keep us out. Neither of us &quot;won&quot; last night. Hopefully next time we can compromise better.<br>
<br>
As for the PNP issue, we did not call down a GM on you. We merely asked the GM why they repopped the zone when there were already people inside and it was about to respawn soon. They informed us that you had asked them to do it and they felt generous so they did. That's it. <br>
<br>
And yes our monk (we only kept one FD at the time) camped out once CT started killing. We made special efforts all night to keep the aggro down by alternating our monks.<br>
<br>
Like I said at the beginning of this post, this is a game to me. I do not hold grudges and I do not center my life around EQ. I have enough to deal with in RL without worrying about whether or not I can go to Fear.<br>
<br>
Oh, and BTW many of us there last night were not Fear newbies. We just don't always use the same accounts, servers or characters.<br>

<br>
Not being arrogant because they dont want to join with you.  Guilds do it all the time when ppl ask to join, some guilds prefer to keep it to themselves, which I would have done with.  Joint guild raids dont go over too well many times, why should they take the risk simply because you want them too?<br>
