<br>
I mentioned in previous statments- It is futile to attempt to prove the existance of God through arguements... Tell someone that God did X or Y and they will say prove it and prove everything about that, then prove that all that ever existed. The bible talks about those that will always be blind...<br>
<br>
I could site other documents and you would continue to argue against those as well. No matter how much documented proof be presented before you- you will never accept them or be dissuaded- and for this I will no doubt sound like an arrogant ass.<br>
<br>
Even if I attempt to strictly use logic or if I continue to site outside anti-christian refrences you would proceed in doing your best to discredit the documents and the logic. <br>
<br>
No amount of arguing the existance of God or attempting to somehow prove to you that Jesus existed will ever be fruitful.<br>
<br>
The &quot;futile to argue&quot; thing I began with before comes from having this argument many times before and realizing that people are never &quot;won&quot; over to believing in God. No amount of debate is ever going to help with this subject. For every resource I can name you will undoubtedly furnish a counter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The spirituality and Belief in God that I have is not something that I or anyone can ever argue into you.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If I say: &quot;This document is valid because...&quot;, you simply counter with: &quot;No, it's not because...&quot; and then we are back to square one... thus it is futile.<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it friends, we are simply going to have to agree to disagree.<br>
<br>
I will leave this thread by saying that,<br>
<br>
I believe that there is a God because believing in the Chaos of evolution and submitting to the hopelessness of NO afterlife is just too horribly depressing for me to go on living. (I really mean that)<br>
<br>
What is this whole existance of ours worth if we are only here to work, propagate, grow old and fade away to dust? Should I be ok with being insignificant? Should I be contented to go on living knowing that nothing I do matters and the only reason we are here is because of some goo or ooze from billions of years ago? <br>
<br>
If I sound arrogant in my belief in God it's because I HAVE to believe- otherwise I question my very existance and the hopelessness is just too much for me.<br>
 <br>
I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> choose</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to believe in the evidence put before me which offers me hope, love and a prospect of a Heaven- and I need those things just as I need my very next breath.<br>
Argue that all you want.<br>
<br>
IMO- When it comes down to it- My belief in God and his son Jesus gives me hope. I respectfully won't tell you what your not believing in God gives you as I really have no idea.  I will continue to cling to my hope- I need it.<br>
<br>
Best wishes to you all and my highest regard and respect to you for your comments, they were very well thought out and elegantly presented.<br>

Dunkk, I very much respect the above statement. I have no desire to &quot;deconvert&quot; believers and I certainly feel that if religion helps people and is not destructive to others then nobody has any business trying to take that away.<br>

Truthfully Lukaria I really don't follow what quote you are refering to. I trully wish Dunkk well and the quote of Dunkk's I provided is grounds for taking him at his word.<br>
<br>
Lukaria, maybe you can clarify what you mean? I can tell you this... Dunkk took the high road and didn't try to convince me that what I saw was arrogance was o.k. like you did. You could learn much from Dunkk and Brutas about style. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I wasn't clear though sorry, it was late (as it is now).  The quote I was referring to was actually not Dun's, but yours.  <br>
<br>
I was wondering if you believed everything the writer of that article wrote, the article you quoted (from infidels or something from the net).  Your post had quotation marks around it, so even though assuming is dangerous, I assumed the view posted was a quote from the actual article.  Correct me if I am wrong on that.<br>
<br>
Assuming the post was a quote from the actual article, I was curious if you believed all the views the writer expressed.  <br>
<br>
Its late, I'm tired, if you need a quote from your previous post cause I was not clear enough, it'll need to wait till tomorrow.  Nite.<br>

<br>
Ah, I see. Yes, I believe the facts the writer presents (which I did provide a link to the full article giving the writer credit). However, I do not entirely agree with his conclusion. While there is nothing *contemporary* to Jesus that would prove he existed I believe that there was a &quot;Jesus&quot; in virtue of the birth of the Christian Church and the subsequent writings about Jesus (some of which were canonized in the 4th century CE to become the &quot;New Testament&quot;). Was Jesus a man who existed? The evidence suggests that is not likely. Remember, historical personages do not need to have actually existed in order to influence cultures (take the Arthurian Legends as one example). It is more likely that the writer of the Pauline epistles invented the persona of &quot;Jesus&quot; during some very troubling times in that region of Palestine which eventually leads to the destruction of Jerusalem around 70 CE by the Romans. It is no surprise that the Pauline epistles are dated around the destruction of Jerusalem with the Gospels following. Such points to the invention of yet another &quot;Messiah&quot; to save the Hebrews from their terrible plight. <br>
<br>
So, the short answer is &quot;Yes, but...&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
