 <br>
    Well then... I must say that reading this thread for the past hour has really disapointed me. Some of you know me very well and some not at all but i must finally put my two cents in.<br>
<br>
        Phoenix Crusaders, I have a few great friends in your guild and still call them that. As i stated to my guild noone was right here not you not us. One cleric does not have a right to this camp over another... I know alot of our guild feel like the newbies to the high end of the game, because well...we are. It is a shame to see a guild with such power and influence as PC disrespect others... I am not attacking just stating that you have the ability in your guild to do so much to help the people of this server and this &quot;game&quot;. <br>
<br>
       Greylords, I must say I have a ton of respect for alot of members of your guild, one of my oldest friends in EQ, Necarozz, is a proud member of your guild. I dont know when or where anyone showed up in SF but I do know that name calling and stuff in OOC was said by all sides. <br>
<br>
       Ater Draconis, You are my guild and my friends, AD was formed by members and officers of other guilds that hoped to bring their old friends together in a guild that loved to raid. In this situation we are as guilty as all involved. It doesnt matter who was there first or last. This topic has gone well beyond a camp and towards lack of respect to others. <br>
<br>
       I must say that to all parties involved this camp has brought out the worst in everyone here. EVERYONE is guilty of one thing... Ignorance. Be it ignorance of the situation...Or pure ignorance on how to treat others with respect... It is imposilbe to &quot;camp&quot; a 72+ hour spawn... Noone can ever be there first... But this random bullshit cant last, especially when the random could be up to 48 hours before the actual spawn...<br>
<br>
        I feel it is time to stop bickering and fighting like children and come to a agreement on this situation. If we dont this rant will show up every few weeks or so and some other guild will be getting badmouthed. Wether it be a lottery, a list of clerics ready to do Rage(yeah yeah i know itd be an enormous list blah blah) Or just a set of rules to follow, even if it is a damn FFA camp... Cant we come up with some sort of guidlines to help this camp be somewhat civil. We all know the GM's are completely useless in this matter, so why do you whine and cry to them once a week about this camp...Handle it ourselves.<br>
       <br>
      I realize the responce i will get from this, most will say itll never work, or are those the ones that are just not willing to try? I have to many friends that have quit EQ over this camp ALONE. <br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
On a completely seperate note, to those of you badmouthing my guild and my friends. As stated above, EVERYONE is as guilty as the next in this situation. What people need to realize is that bitching and whining acmplishes nothing, but moving on acomplishes everything. Live, learn, and dont make the mistakes again. The bottom line is that this rant is going to continue to be repeated 100 fold if something is not done about it, so what is the point of argueing? Think about it...<br>

<br>
You said it best right there, EVEN though we MAY come up with SOMETHING most of us can agree on there will ALWAYS be someone who says &quot;we didn't agree to that so :P&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
But honestly I think there is a SIGNIFICANT difference between this monk/&quot;outdoor dragon&quot;<br>
<br>
Ragefire stays in one spot right, that platform right there *points to the platfrom* and he stays there, right?<br>
<br>
TADA BIG DIFFERENCE between Ragefire and Gorenaire (another Kunark &quot;outdoor dragon&quot; that being the OTHER outdoor dragons move around...everylast one of them, Ragefire does not)<br>
<br>
meaning IMHO the rules perhaps deserver a rewrite in the whole ragefire issue. <br>
<br>
NON-STATIC dragons = non-campable<br>
Static &quot;Dragons&quot; = campable and should be respected as such  much like the indoor static mobs (VS/TRAK)<br>
<br>
/shrug again won't matter if we said WHOA you're right there is ATLEAST one group who will (I know of one guild that already said they won't respect a &quot;rotation&quot; say we don't agree to it so we won't respect it <br>
<br>
Perhaps we should rethink the including that group in rotations for they believe in a FFA EQ society (paraphrasing a post in another thread where someone from a guild in VS and trak rotation stated that thier guild will not respect ANY Ragefire Rotation..if ya'd like I'll be happy to copy/paste the post here....then again lousy attitude probably isn't enough for something as extreme as sharing agreed upon uber_mob_199 rotation <br>
<br>
/shrug seems there should be a  way to &quot;punish&quot; guilds with such pissy attitudes then again we should all respect each other and not have such pissy attitudes <p>Level 51 Cleric of Erollisi Marr<BR>

<br>
THEY deserve it more because THEY have spent TIME sitting there, THEM not you, sitting there for 6 days straight, using REAL time regardless of if it's a game or not. Time is time, it always has been and always will be. They have worked HARD and have sat there and endured all the time of camping it. THEY have worked for it, not you.&quot;<br>
<br>

They don't deserve something just because they were waiting for it.  No cleric deserves their @#%$ epic.  noone deserves jack @#%$.  people have earn there @#%$ epic and not be told or to reasure themselves by friends telling them they deserve it.<br>

I know i said i was done with this topic but my character was just attacked. <br>
<br>
No respect? You fool. I actually think I respect the time put in by clerics more than you. Why? Cause I respect the years a person may have put in playing a cleric. I respect the hours spent after a nasty wipeout while I slept and many clerics I knew were still online making sure everyone got their rez. I respect the clerics that run balls to the wall with no cover through a plane to try and rez a group of poor souls who they dont even know. I respect the hours upon hours put in by a cleric to make themselves better. But most of all I respect the fact that although they can play many hours a night, some clerics cant afford the luxury of sitting in one damn spot for days on end. You think that sittin on your ass &quot;holding a spawn&quot; earns you anything? Last I looked there was a lot more to being a cleric buddy. <br>
<br>
But see thats the problem. Those of you who can afford the luxury of just sitting there for days on end use this &quot;oh they didnt earn it defense&quot; for one simple reason: it suits you. It doesnt matter if the cleric is only lvl 51 compared to a 60. It doesnt matter if the  player who has only been playing for a year is compared to a player who has played for 3 or more. It doesnt matter to you that some of these clerics were running raids into hate before you learned you could actually hit bats in freeport even though they were flying. Its either that or you are the most incedibly short sighted people on emarr. You sir, have no idea what earn means.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umalevant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malevant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/02 11:42:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I am sick to death of the argument that just because you have a life outside of EQ you cannot get the cleric epic.  It is doable if two things happen.  1) You have friends who are willing to put in the time with you. 2) Your time there is respected.  You, and many others, conveniently forget to consider the fact that all of the guilds that have stated they will not respect a camper's privaledges at RF are more than capable of mounting a sustained camp there themselves with almost no lost ability.  Having a single group there from a large guild that can rotate members in and out easily and without forcing anyone to camp for days on end means, quite simply, that it IS doable to those who have lives outside of EQ.  I have known some rather &quot;dedicated&quot; clerics who are on a great great deal, but I have seen at least as many if not more part time players who got their epics without compromising how much time they expended on the game.<br>
<br>
Your argument is self-fulfilling.  It is when a large guild or guilds declares that it won't respect anyone else who puts in time and effort at RF that it becomes necessary to park more people there for a longer time.  If they did not, a single group or less could park out there, rotate in and out with friends, and manage it incredibly easily.<br>
<br>
You talk about how much respect you have for clerics, and then go right around and essentially tell all those who are not in a large guild to go shag themselves.  Every hate raid you have been on has been a large guild affair, then, I take it, because that cleric who ran &quot;balls to the wall&quot; more often than not on any other sort of raid is not in a guild that can muster what you seem to demand from all those clerics you &quot;respect&quot; so much. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.

<br>
Trech, I feel the same way. Alderac took something in the order of 20 deaths on one fear raid for me because I wanted a shot at my epic piece. We had never done a North wall break in, but he waas hell bent on making it work for me cuz that's the way I asked for it. That's why I sacrificed a week worth of work (self employed, nuf said) and only slept 3 or 4 hours a night so that I could help him maintain some sort of force at that camp to take rage when he spawned, and that's why this bothered us all so bad. Because in all of our eyes Ald deserves this and has earned it with his selfless dedication to his guild and his friends. And as of now he still doesnt have it.<br>
<br>
Anyways, whats done is done, and it can't be undone. I do plan to continue to push for Ragefire for my guilds clerics. In the future I would like to not have problems like these. I'm going to say what I told you I wanted to hear from your side right now, and I'm hoping that I'm gonna hear it back:<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for the trouble this has caused, I really am. We were put on the defensive and we lashed out. We may not have fully understood everything that was said to us, some things may have been taken the wrong way. Peoples feelings were hurt, and that was never any of our intensions. Next time we promise not to hit the attack button untill we've had more time to talk about whats going on.<br>
<br>
I hope that makes you feel a bit better about this, my words are sincere and I want this to stop here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=razer>Razer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/28/02 3:03:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=166>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> again, this whole thing was caused by a single cleric, unguilded, named Raijin.<br>
<br>
Sure, PC was there before for a couple hours while we were, sure they said &quot;it's a FFA camp, first with a force to engage and NOT kite it gets it&quot; which angered people. sure someone may have responded in a bad way to that comment.<br>
<br>
However, things were going fine, we had a bigger force, they had a handful of people, all was going alright until Raijin plonked his ass down in the middle of our people standing around the rage spawn spot and started threatening to bring out manaburn wizzies to take rage when he popped.<br>
<br>
Raijin was why a GM was called in. Raijin is why the GM shouted to the zone saying that whoever had the force there and engaged the mob first would get him, and told us all to solve it or she'd come TL everyone out.<br>
<br>
Her shouts are what caused PC to call in more people, and for GL to call in a bunch of people. She basically said she didn't want to deal with it, and we had to figure it out.<br>
<br>
I knew, the instant I read her shout that more people would start to arrive, in the race to get a bigger force there to be the first to engage should he pop.<br>
<br>
There were mainly AD people standing around his spawn still, plus Raijin and his rogue, plus some PC people and GL people, all mixed in.<br>
<br>
It was when PC and GL started telling us we should give up and random for the rights that a guide was brought in and decided we all had to roll (3 clerics from 3 guilds, plus that 4th cleric)<br>
<br>
So yes, This was a matter of lack of respect for someone else. Noone was in there pushing their way in originally. PC's 5 people reminded us that it was FFA, but we had no worries with their handful.<br>
<br>
When the GM made her call, PC and GL decided to take advantage of it, probably thinking that we wouldn't bother to raise a stink about it, because if we did the GM would come in and kick us all out anyways.<br>
<br>
And about the Trak BP thing while helping that bard, I am thinking this is a pile of BS. I am going to ask around, and will see if I can get ahold of the bard and ask him about it. I don't think anyone in a position within AD to call us all in to help someone like that would demand anything of the person. <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br>

<br>
Last night all of Ater Draconis was bored, and we wanted something to do. Since we had all just logged back on after a short patch, we decided we would head over th Umbral Planes and og after the big mobs we had been doing for the last little while after said patches.<br>
<br>
I was over there, so I went to check out the situation in the zone, and when I got in there were around 18 people from 1 guild standing around the tunnel, pulling single mobs in the be killed. I asked them what their plans were in there, and I was told they planned to take down Doomshade, Rumblecrush, and any other named mobs they could. I relayed the information to the guild, and we decided that rather than move in and try to share all the mobs with others, we would let them have it and everyone would go off and have an EXP night, so people grouped up and oved off to various zones.<br>
<br>
So we're talking a fully popped Zone, one that people can't call as something they are camping, but did we move in and tell them everything in the zone was FFA and that we were entitled to the mobs just as much as they were? no, we let them take it.<br>
<br>
Why? because we like to respect other guilds. When we get there first and we're planning to go after specific mobs, we like it when others respect that and let us, and we give the same back to them when they do it.<br>
<br>
This is the type of guild I like the be in. I like the be around people with this same type of respect. I have NEVER moved in and forced a mob from anyone else, and I would hate myself if I did it. If I did do it because of a mistake on my part (not seeing anyone there, and then killing a mob, or anything else that caused me to kill something that wasn't mine) I would apologize profusely and see if there's anything I could do.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I like to go to Sro, and run around killing as much as I can. I have my jboots, I don't need the AC ring, I mainly do it to help others there, and shout out pointers to people who I think are neglecting something important when trying to make him pop. When I see an SG pop, I shout out his location, and if noone takes him, THEN I go run and take him down.

Now the unguilded cleric is to blame after several days of Rants an Flames against PC an GL.<br>

Wow Trech... your respect for those balls to the walls clerics continues to astound me and warm my heart!  I have answered your argument.  A casual player can get his or her epic if they have friends to assist them.  I have no where said that someone who plays more frequently deserves their epic more.  I have stated, time and again, that a cleric who is able, through whatever means, casual or not, to keep the camp occupied deserves to have their rights as a player respected.  I also like how you seem to think all &quot;hardcore&quot; EQ players are 52 cleric highschool students.  Don't know any dedicated level 60 clerics who play online a lot Trech?  Those folks get screwed too by your assertion.  Again, way to show respect for those clerics.  You can couch it in whatever spin you want, but the fact is you don't give a damn about clerics, and all the respect commentary you so heartwarmingly gave is BS, plain and simple.  You are here to start fights and talk trash, not through any vested interest in the spawn, the guilds involved, or clerics as a class. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.

FFA doesnt benefit anyone, just makes everyone mad.  There will always be someone out there that wants to KS and we have to devise a method of fixing this that is agreed by everyone.  <br>

My guild can vouch for PC and what their clerics will do for Ragefire - they have backed out of RF camps, even after days on them, if they don't believe the camp is their right and Scyrra did that recently where we were involved. We will fully back PC on a Ragefire camp if they ask us for our assistance and we've made that well known to them, and that is simply because of their good will towards us.<br>

What I take strong exception to are the actions taken by PC in respects to RF, and the justifications for those actions.  With one exception, whom I have disliked since before they joined your guild, every single PC member I have met has been a very decent sort.  I want to make a clear distinction here.  I am sure that your guild is full of wonderful people, and I will not nor has it ever been my intent to contest that.<br>
<br>
With as much poor press that it is recieving in respect to this, looking elsewhere on these boards I could find numerous instances of posts thanking your guild, or individual members of your guild, for actions in game.  I am not denying that or saying they are wrong.  What I am saying is that how you handle the RF spawn does not do justice to your perception (and others) of your guild as a decent guild that respects the rights of others.  I have had no cause to have any issue with you, or your guild, in any arena save the debate over actions commited at Ragefire camps.<br>
<br>
I have my information straight.  Acting well behaved in a specific instance does not mean your guild has behaved admirably in every instance of RF.  I have seen firsthand what PC actions have done to RF campers, and I take exception to the attitude expressed by some that they are chumps for camping a mob, and do not deserve respect.  Annetoinette, I can have a problem with how PC, as a guild, treats people at this spawn without wanting, like some (Kuai), to badmouth your guild about unrelated matters or things which you bear no responsibility over.  Your rep with RF, for me and others, is frankly poor.  That is a statement of fact.  You have also behaved admirably there on occasion.  That too is a statement of fact.  I do not contest the latter, and I intend and have tried wholeheartedly to keep my criticisms of your guild confined to the former. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.

Yes, Raijin was the person who started this situation and caused a GM to be called in. PC was the first to try to take advantage of the GM's call by calling in more people to see if they could just gain aggro first which would have meant that it was their mob and anyone who interfered with that was in the wrong. <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br>

English is not my native language so please try to overlook the bad grammar and spelling.<br>
<br>
I was not in SF at the time, so I cannot claim to know what happened. However, I have been an officer in this game for 2 years now, and have seen a few of these situations, and have had to deal with similar problems and always tried to be a fair as I possible could. 2 GLs has been deguilded by me at those times.<br>
<br>
Razer, I think that when you tried to describe the events in one of your later posts, you seam to be close to the core problem. Still, to blame it on a single cleric is a bit unfair. The main problem about the RF is that there are several rules about how to handle it. Several rules mean in fact no rules. GMs have stated FFA. First one to bring in a force big enough to kill is used by some and a marathon camp by a single character is use by others. There is a reason why we do not have any epic clerics in GL. If we where KSing all the time, this would not be the case.<br>
<br>
What most of you fail to see, is that we all (GL, PC, AD and every other guild on this server) try to play by the book and respect others, but when every single party out there use different rules, there will be problems. This will lead to confrontations. A disagreement is NOT the same thing as KS, and do not mean that your opponents do nothing else but KS all day long, as been suggested on this board. <br>
<br>
Since this is not a PvP server, we have to use our brains and common sense to solve a situation like this. Seams like this was tried. No luck, time for a GM or guide. The decision was that it was a FFA. This was not accepted, and there where a roll. At this point you cannot say it is a KS.  Unfortunately Daka won. If AD had won the roll, this pointless discussion had never taken place.  <br>
<br>
After the second patch we got company in SF. We wished the other guild good luck and they wished us the same. After some time we where outnumbered by 2 to 1. I logged at that time. Hope they got him.<br>
<br>
I know for a fact, that there are many good players in AD. Some of them have posted here as well, BUT I must say, that if a member of GL had used the same language and been calling names like the AD guild leader, we would have deguilded him on sight.<br>
<br>
Razer, I hate to ruin your illusion of AD as the home of all good, the guild of pallys only. You make it sound like AD has a patent on not KSing. You even write a long post about how you had to cancel a raid due to the fact that there where others ahead of you. Sorry friend, but that is the way most raids end for ALL guilds and that is why we all try to have a back up plan for a raid. I will say what you so desperately want to hear ? Well done! BUT to post here just to say you have backed out of a zone or camp do NOT earn you respect. Every guild does it all the time. Seams like you think it is something extra ordinary, unique to AD. You say that you want to belong to a guild that do back out from a camped zone or mob. Well, you will have a very hard time to find a guild on this server that do not do that. <br>
<br>
OK, I do not know what happened in SF that unfortunately day. However, some posts have accused AD to be rude in ooc, probably scaring some player away, pissing other players off. If you read all that have been posted here in this matter, you find a pattern. A few ADs accusing and calling names in a high pitched voice, desperately trying to state that AD is a guild that deserves respect and the rest of us have KSing as main goal. PCs and GLs and a few ADs trying to reason. I can see why a solution was not reached at the spot.<br>
<br>
I am sure that most clerics that tried for the epic has had to back out, lost rolls and come out without RF. They all have had an understanding of the problems involved in this camp and will just try again. They have done this without dragging a single person or whole guilds names in the dirt.  <br>
<br>
As long as we cannot agree on one single rule about the RF, this will happen again and again.  I just hope you get your cleric his epic. The rest of this server seams to be able to handle it without starting to throw @#%$ around on the E marr board.<br>
<br>
I have said what I wanted to say and you will not find a reply from me after you picked my post apart and called me whatever names you going to make up.<br>

Forget for a minute what Verant says. As always, everybody knows that Verant will rule FFA and first to engage wins. Thats a no brainer and no need to even bring up what Verant or GM's think.<br>

Do you people belong to a large guild thats so hung up on yourself and so into the "right of passage" that you can't forget your own needs for 20 minutes and help this person?<br>
<br>
Does your large guild need 1 more cleric epic right then over this person that belongs to a guild that has no cleric epics?<br>
<br>
Folks, keep in mind that you don't always hunt with your guild and this unguilded cleric or cleric in a small guild would probably be the first to click you if she/he zoned in somewhere and saw corpses needing a res.<br>
<br>
I know that my epic has come in handy on guild raids, but I bet I have used it 90% more on zoning in somewhere and seeing corpses, sending a tell and asking if they need a res. I never charge and cancel donations and I bet most all clerics with their epic do the same.<br>
