If that was the case, then white/grey etc have nothing to do with good or evil.<br>
<br>
I always simply figured that when he defeated the Balrog it was the true test of his powers, or he figured some new kind of power (when faced with death) to defeat it ultimatly making him more powerful.<br>

Once he faces the balrog (the idea of it obviously frightened him) I think he reaches the confidence and strength needed to be in complete command of his power.<br>
<br>
I don't see robes as something automated, thus Saruman being able to still wear his wite robes after giving in to Sauron.  I wonder (doubt it tho) if his robes being somewhat dirtyed in a later scene in the mine was used as a parallel of him being corrupted by Sauron, or was simply just so it would fit in with him walking around all that mud.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Oh, about him dieing, I don't think he actually physically died, but rather his old inner-self that was open to temptation and doubt and fear 'died' through facing his greatest (?) fear. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=18807" target="CRProfile" alt="Yunna's Profile" title="Yunna's Profile"><img src="http://www.conquest-guild.com/members/yunna/sig2001.jpg" border="0" alt=" "></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umystiquedekami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MystiqueDeKami</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/24/01 3:19:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulaian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulaian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Whore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/24/01 5:35:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOTR book 2 question</span><hr size=1> &quot;The White&quot; is simply a title designating the head of the order of wizards - two others we hear of in the books are Gandalf (the grey) and Radagast (the brown). This order, by the way, is called the White Council.<br>
<br>
In the books, as opposed to the movie, there is never any indication that Saruman is in fact a more powerful wizard than Gandalf. He did not assume the position as head of the order himself, but was rather elected to be the leader - it is mentioned that some of the other notable good characters in the books voted for Gandalf as leader, but were in minority. As for robes... Saruman's robes are a bit special in the books. They appear to be white, but after revealing his true position to Gandalf, they turn out to have all the colours of the rainbow. White was merely an illusion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I do in fact believe that Gandalf was always a more powerful wizard than Saruman. For one, unlike Saruman he was able to withstand the temptation of using the one ring. Also, he has a certain advantage over Saruman that would make a great difference - while Saruman was the wizard who studied the lore of the rings and their making, Gandalf is actually wearing Narya, one of the 3 elven rings, second only in power to the one ruling ring. Which also explains his temptation for the one, as it was made to bind the ring he is already using.<br>
<br>
On subject, i believe Gandalf had something like a near death experience after his battle with the Balrog. He certainly only barely survived it. And that balrog was definitely something he feared, it was an even more powerful creature in the book than in the movie (movie balrog is just a huge fiery guy with a flaming whip - book balrog is that as well as a spellcaster of near gandalf's ability). So he had a very close encounter with death, and defeated something he feared greatly - that would certainly make a new person out of him. <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

Saruman, Radagast, Gandalf and two &quot;Blue&quot; Wizards were sent by the Valar (the gods, essentially) in the middle of the Third Age to combat Sauron.  The wizards were of the order Maiar (demigods), much the same as Sauron was when he served Morgoth/Melkor.  The colors in their name came from the robes they wore, not much else ;/  When Gandalf defeated the Balrog, his physical shell was too damaged to continue, and passed, but his immortal spirit fled West to his home, and the Valar granted him a new one, with which to combat Sauron.<br>
<br>
thx &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Oh, and the White Council had nothing to do with the Wizards..  Galadriel and Celeborn (and maybe Elrond) were on the Council as well.  The White Council was formed by the good races of Middle Earth to combat Sauron. <p><p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">

When Morgoth was cast into the void, Sauron filled his masters shoes by taking over.<br>
<br>
The Wizards of the council were Maiar (As Van stated), but so were the Balrogs. The Balrogs were seduced to the dark by Sauron and Melkor in the days before time when the Elves were young. (They had just been awakened from their creation).  It was a Balrog that broke and burned Amon Sul on Weathertop (SP? It's been a while since I read it), which is the old ruins that Aragorn and the Hobbits were attacked at.<br>
<br>
And Van is right about Gandalf's mortal shell having died. It was simply too damaged to continue. When Gwaihir the Wind Lord (The great Eagle) finds him atop the mountains, he doesn't completely realize that his friend had indeed died. Though he did comment about how Gandalf was light as a feather when he bore him to Lothlorien. Celeborn and Galadriel aided him into a new form. As Gandalf the White, he was more powerful. He had been transformed by his death and some argue that when had taken an Immortal body to go with his immortal spirit. The case made for this was that he didn't fear battle after that point. He was more or less indestructible and untouchable.<br>

Sauron escaped the Doom of Morgoth, which was being cast into the void at the will of Manwë.  Sauron was under the same judgement, yet the Valar felt that he was broken, and did not pursue him into the East when he fled Thangorodrim.<br>
<br>
The Valar (Manwë especially) realized their error when Numenor was taken under the Shadow of Sauron, and sent the Five to combat him indirectly.<br>

It's been about 12 years since I read the Silmarilion, so my memory of it is a bit hazy. (On top of that I left it out in the sun and the glue holding the pages in melted. When I picked it up it fell apart! Damn paperbacks! hehe)<br>
<br>
I have indeed read Farmer Giles of Ham and the other one (The Green Knight or something like that?) It's been a VERY long time since I read them.. The only thing I really remember about them is that there was some Crystaline Star that he jabbed into his forehead (Or was placed I don't remember). Then he became a Blacksmith?  I'll have to re-read them..<br>

In the books, she shows it to Frodo, in the movie, you can see it if you look closely. The other two elven rings, Vilya was given to Elrond, and Narya to Gandalf.<br>
<br>
Sauron had the 4 of the 7 dwarven rings, the other 3 were consumed by dragons, and of course the 9 for men.<br>
<br>
Frodo had the One. <p><img src="http://www.conquest-guild.com/Elessar/newsig.jpg"><BR>

However I was young at the time. If I remember right, they are more geared for the younger set anyways.<br>
<br>
As for LOTR, I haven't read them in a while. I don't have as much time to read as I used to.. (Partly due to EQ) That doesn't stop me from reading a lot of books. Right now I am in the middle of 5 books (The Dragon Bone chair, Path of Daggers, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dark Heart, and A Sword for a Dragon. And this isn't including my re-reading the Iron Tower Trilogy and the Myth Series from time to time)<br>
<br>
While I am on the computer I listen to a lot of Audiobooks. (Let's face it.. The EQ music sucks after about 30 seconds)  I have the Lord of the Rings on CD.. It's an incredible audio production done by the BBC. It is 13 hours long and is fully dramatized. There are some omissions from the story, but this is for brevity. I'm guessing they didn't think they could hold a person's attention for longer than 13 episodes.<br>
<br>
An interesting note about the BBC's LotR.. There is an interesting role reversal that takes place in one of the cast. The guy who plays Bilbo in the just released movie (Ian Holm), originally played Frodo in the BBC audio production. I recognized the voice almost immediately, but had to wait for the credits to make sure it was the same guy. More useless trivia for you. =)<br>
