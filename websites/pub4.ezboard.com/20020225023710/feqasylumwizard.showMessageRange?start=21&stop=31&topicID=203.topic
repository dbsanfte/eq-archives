<br>
Int is capped at 200 for the amount of Mana that you gain, ie its 10mana(?) per point of int before 200 and 1 point of mana per int over 200.<br>
<br>
However....its capped at 255 for specialisation procs.<br>
<br>
When you specialise in evocation you have a small chance of activiating it..aside from the obviouse benefit wich is a much smaller chance for fizzles, there is also the chance that you will reduce the mana cost of the spell that you cast by 50%. (est).<br>
<br>
Its sorta like a crippling Blow from a warrior except its a reduced mana cost for a wizard.<br>

wizards do not suck in exp groups so i partially agree with this, but we are very mana inefficent and its hard to keep up our dmg potential in constant pulls..also, mages are also very mana inefficent like us but they have a pet who can do constant damage while the mage meds ect..<br>

very well said.. dont forget resist's.. also wizards and casters in general need more items with useful effects. wizard quest robes in velious are a JOKE with the 30 second cast time. only useful wizard items with an effect that i can think of atm is velks robe, rend robe, SoTF, staff of temperate flux, mana robe, ect<br>
you say well, ok those are nice items and yes they are, but then look at how many haste items melee's get. look how much armor and weapons effect the melee classes. wizards used SPELLS for weapons and defense. while melee's armor and weapons have gotten much better with the quest armor and primal, our spells have been stagnat and we are falling way behind melee<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How are we the most versitlie and powerful in the game? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ok I mispoke myself here, take out versatile due to the fact that we cant buff for shit (unless you consider O'keils a buff, NOT).  What I was driving at was versatility in terms of types of Damage we can do.  Our PB AoE's rule, rains are cool (when a mob is totally debuffed only).  We get a wide array of stuns, both AoE and Single Target, and of Course Lures.<br>
<br>

You are correct...however over an hours time we equal the damage output of any warrior, and depending on your mana pool you can exceed most Rogues.  Downtime really is an issue if you dont have C2, no chanter means that a lowly paladin will have a better DPS than you.<br>
<br>
We can DEMOLISH the DPS of even the best rogues when we go into overburn Mode (just have concussion spell).<br>
<br>
Just a Note on the Free Nuke items we get that Sondor brought up and that I didnt mention.  There are LOTS of free nuke items for us, unfortunately the real good ones are found primarily in VP or from Velks, each of these require massive raid force to do and get the items.  So most wizards wont even get to see those items let alone the mobs that have them.<br>
<br>
VP Rend Robe...12 sec cast time 792(?) nuke<br>
VP Lure Stick....Flames of Ro 425 Lure Fire Nuke...8 sec cast time<br>
Conflag Robe....Conflaguration....688(?)..12 sec cast time i beleive.<br>
<br>
Those are the three good ones that I know of.<br>

<br>
I will disagree on this heh.<br>
<br>
When you look at the Kunark expansion, wizard class got Boned big time, there is no doubt about that.  But with SoV, we actually got some fantastic gear to makeup for getting screwed in kunark.  And when i mean Kunark i mean everything except VP.  Some sweet items in there for our class.<br>
<br>
SoV gear changed that tremendously for us.  More Hp and AC and Mana on that gear makes us more effective in grp and raid situations.<br>
<br>
Mascen....<br>
<br>
Ill try to find the original thread from castersrealm, but when i read it twas a year ago.  It was also confirmed by a friend of mine (cleric), he was the one that made me look for the thread to begin with.<br>
<br>
I may actually place a post on Graffe asking for some verifiable confirmation from other wizards, all i can do is speak of my own experience though.<br>
<br>
I have noticed the specialisation go off from time to time, How do i notice this?  Only on a Vulak Fight has it ever been noticable( 20minute fights are fantastic), when chain DB'ng him sometimes i get off anywhere from 12-15 nukes on a single Bar of Mana (25 nukes is what i get off the entire fight).  Now mind you im buffed to the gills with C2, GoB, PoG, BoF etc etc).  My Mana bar should only be able to accomodate at best 10 DB's. (factoring in Mana Regen).<br>
<br>
Then again, i may be imagining the entire thing, but i do beleive that it is credible.  On the flip side, the specialisation kicking in is damn rare, so dont spend too much effort in trying to get your int that high at the expense of pure Mana items.<br>

Argh! Where are your hard numbers to back-up a statement like this up? I've seen spreadsheets that do comparitive analysis on weapon damage output based on data from log files. Wizards need to do something similar to clear the air once and for all.<br>
<br>
Case in point. I twinked a level 24 warrior of mine out with an aged velium claidmore and STR items to raise his STR to 205. Warrior averaged 60 pts damage a pop, unbuffed, based on the log file data. There is no way a level 24 wizard can be twinked to put out that much damage over an hour. If you know how, let us in on the secret.<br>

Lack of hard numbers is the same beef I have with the authors of the original white paper.<br>

My main beef has always been that while the damage/healing of other classes increases tremendously from level 49 to 59,  the wizard is exactly the same as 49 except for different flavors of the same lolipop. Finally at level 58 you get a spell that has a little better damage/mana ratio (draught of frost), but too little to late in my opinion.<br>
