I don't know if I'm right about this, but the casual use of the term &quot;gay&quot; in everyday conversation seems to denote a certain stamp of acceptance.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I think it's wrong, one of my best friends is gay and I wouldn't use the term gay in a way that is derogatory or hurtful.  Yet, I have no such issues with &quot;lame&quot; and &quot;dumb.&quot;  Hmmmmm.  <br>

I think it must have come about in a derogatory way, but that's one thing I haven't thought of: that using it denotes a kind of acceptance of it.  There's some food for thought...<br>

I'm getting sick of seeing people comparing homosexuality with race. You can't control the color of the skin you were born with (excluding Michael Jackson, or is that Latoya...hmm or maybe they're the same, I dunno), but you can control your sexual preference.<br>
<br>
Oh boy, here goes...I can see the posts lining up now about &quot;being born gay,&quot; but I don't buy into that one bit.  You can show me all the science you want about people being &quot;born gay,&quot; and you won't convince me.  Why not? Well, because I can show you similar scientific research proving that serial killers are &quot;born serial killers&quot;, that rapists are &quot;born rapists,&quot; and a thief is &quot;born a thief.&quot; I can show you scientific data that will justify practically any action a human being can commit, but do these predispositions determine entirely this persons actions?  The answer is an overwhelming no.  We are humans.  We have judgement.  We make choices. <br>
<br>
Let me clarify something here...I'm not here to suggest that homosexuals should be classed into the same group as rapists and murderers.  I would not suggest such a thing.  I'm simply implying that all people are born with genetic predispositions to have certain tendencies, some very strong, but inevitably, it is that person's judgement that decides his course.  The color of a person's skin, however, is entirely determined prior to that person's birth.  Never did a choice come into play in this determination (at least not one made by the individual conceived, of course).<br>
<br>
I have discussed this very topic with homosexual friends of mine, and though they don't like my stance on this issue because it damages their &quot;push for civil liberties,&quot; they admit it is difficult to refute.<br>
<br>
So am I condemning homosexuals here?  No, at least not intentionally.  The push for acceptance of homsexuality in this country, in the world for that matter, is an entirely different topic.  I feel, however, that it needs to be approached by the homosexual community on a different plane than race...as an action chosen, and fought for as such, instead of as a simple state of being.<br>
<br>
Now, should we run around freely spouting gay (ghey) about every topic that we think is such?  Hmmm, I dunno.  Oh yeah, that's what this thread is about, isn't it?  Damn did I get off track...heh.<br>

Back when I was in highschool I had a friend whos entire family is jewish, and whenever he thought something was stupid he said it was &quot;hella jewish&quot; (his words, not mine, don't jump on me for it).  It has been commonplace in todays society to take things that people either are uncomfortable with or don't fully understand and use the term out of context.  Gay means happy or full of joy, yet we took the word and used it for homosexuals.  The same with the word nigger.  Nigger means ignorant, yet in the past it was used as a slur against black men and women.  The list goes on and on, and until we take a step back and fully become conscious we are doing it nothing will change.  I would be lying if I said I never typed ghey in game, I have done it a few times when not thinking, and have regretted hitting enter every time I did it.  The thing is, it is something we should not be doing, but since it is so prevalent in society and since we hear it while we are growing up, it gets ingrained in our brain as acceptable, which it most definitely should not be. <p><a href=http://afflictionguild.com/scripts/member.x?username=Aphroditex&charactername=Aphroditex>Aphroditex Bubblefists</a></b>;  Serenity Z'Chaotic; Pickett Pocketts<BR>

As for the original question, I use &quot;gay&quot; in a lot of my daily speaking for a lot of different reasons aside from trying express elation or sexual preference.  I can watching the game with my straight buds and say &quot;that call was really gay&quot; and I don't think twice about it.  I guess its the whole socialization thing.  Even though I know 100's of gay people, I must know 1000's upon 1000's of straight people and thats how a lot of us happen to talk.  Kinda like a part of a social dialect.  *shrug*  When I say &quot;gay&quot; in a social context with other gay individuals, they sometimes get offended and sometimes they do not.  What I mean by the word &quot;gay&quot; varies with the context of the conversation, and if I use it to mean that I think something sucks, it doesn't mean that I think gay people are inferior in any way or that I am disregarding their hardships or trying to promote intolerance.<br>
<br>
As for being able to control sexual orientation?  That is just ludicrous.  This might sound really base, but for you guys out there, watch a heterosexual pornographic film focusing on breast flopping around, ditzy blonde women moaning sensually as though the guy actually knew that there is no such thing as a vaginal orgasm (sorry boys, its just a myth!) and whatever else supposedly appeals to straight men.  Now, you may have gotten an erection.  Next pop in a gay film with two men going at it.  Now you might be repulsed or just indifferent.  Is this because you have actively chosen to get an erection or not?  Nope...you are just naturally responding to the stimuli, I'm sure you did not have to logically coerce yourself into getting turned on.<br>
<br>
The same just so happens for gay individuals.  We don't sit down and say one day, &quot;I think I'll be gay now.&quot;  It's as natural to us as heterosexuality is to the majority.<br>

<br>
There have been a few gay activist types who have tried to get Verant to do something about all the gay bashing in the game.  As far as I know, Verant has never done much.  I don't blame them.  Trying to stop gay bashing by high school and college age kids would be like trying to stop the sun from rising.<br>
<br>
As for the word &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;ghey,&quot; the other words you mentioned are much more emotionally charged.  &quot;Gay&quot; is not a derogatory term for homosexuals.  If you referred to Elton John as gay, you really haven't said anything bad.  If you referred to Jesse Jackson using one of the other words you mentioned, that would be a very different matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigota.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Igota</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 6:48:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sociological Question</span><hr size=1> /cheer Fori<br>

<br>
On the contrary, I said the opposite.  I said that regardless of what a homosexual &quot;feels&quot; biologically, psychologically, or otherwise, it is ultimately his or her own actions which dictates his or her outcome.  That is entirely different that being born a certain race, which has nothing to do with judgement or actions whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Yup, can-o-worms.  I knew it would be, but civil discussion is what this board is for.<br>

More to come, I'm sure.<br>

"moron/idiots - actually clinical terms for people with certain IQ types"<br>
<br>
They were at one point, true.  However, in the 1970's, that was changed.  These terms are no longer clinical terms for people with certain IQ's.  The term "retarded" was used to replace them.  Of course, many people now use "retarded" to indicate they dislike something.<br>
<br>
"dumb - mute"<br>
<br>
I'm not sure about this, but I don't think that saying something is "dumb" to indicate it lacks intelligence comes from the use of it to mean, "mute."  Dumb is rarely ever used to mean mute anymore; I doubt many people even think of it's other meaning.  Of course, it's possible that "dumb" has been in use for so long that the meaning has almost entirely changed.<br>
Personally, I never use "lame" or "gay" to describe anything, unless I am referring to a person who is physically disabled (and I'm not likely to then) or homosexual.  I read a comic strip recently in which one of the gay characters tells his nephew's friend that gay can describe an inanimate object -- as long as you mean that the object is sleek, beautiful, and excellently crafted.<br>
I also don't believe sexual preference is a choice.  I didn't decide to prefer one gender over the other; it's just the way I am.  If you doubt it (and are straight), see if you can make yourself gay.  Try to convince yourself that people of your own sex are desireable.  If you are completely heterosexual, you won't be able to do it.  <br>
Biological studies of the brains of identical twins where one was heterosexual and one was homosexual have shown differences that may indicate the brain is responsible for sexuality.  I suppose one can be born with a predisposition to criminal behavior, I'm not denying that.  However, I know of no research on identical twins where one was a depraved criminal and one was not, that shows any of the same evidence.<br>
I second Gloriana's hope that this won't turn into a gay bashing or political thread.<br>

Umm, I have to refute that. The rest seemed to be sound enough of an argument though. <p>Treage Shadowbane<br>

This truth is self-evident, but like most self-evident truths, it does not say much.  Where is this argument supposed to be leading us?  Does this mean that members of minority races are in more need of civil liberties than sexual minorities?<br>
<br>
I would like to say &quot;no.&quot;  In modern American society, racism has become a taboo.  One cannot easily get away with being a member of the KKK or publicly using racist comments without facing widespread social disapproval (granted, this may vary based on local conditions).  Legislation, such as the Civil Rights acts of 1964 and contemporary Affirmative Action plans indicate the extent to which the public is willing to protect racial minority groups.<br>
<br>
The public is NOT so kind towards sexual minorities, however.  Congress recently passed the horrendous Defense of Marriage act, banning sexual minorites from sharing in sanctified love.  The state of Florida recently banned homosexuals from adoption.  Race is often included in most state Hate Crime legislation, whereas in my own home state of Pennsylvania it is not.  Near my college campus, a homosexual student was beaten to death as the courts accept a &quot;heterosexual panic&quot; defense, mirroring the Matthew Sheppard tragedy.  No recent history of a racial massacre is evident.<br>
<br>
This is not to say that racial minorities and sexual minorities (and religious minorites as well) cannot be grouped together.  In fact, oftentimes these groups prefer to be linked together to work towards common goals.  On my campus, members of varying minority groups, including members of the Lambda Student Allies, the Black Caucus, and Latino/Latina, Asian, and religous minority groups all came together in what was known as the &quot;Village.&quot;  While acknowedging fundamental differences between the groups, the groups shared the common bond of having faced discrimination for no other reason than for being a member of a social minority.  On that fundamental level, they all felt connected to one another.<br>
<br>
In short, the prior argument is inadequate because it only focuses on physical standards and fails to incorporate emotional, psychological, and spiritual concerns.  The ability to hide who you are is irrelevant to who you really are in the end.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utreage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Treage</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 7:48:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sociological Question</span><hr size=1> Doh, no edits<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
