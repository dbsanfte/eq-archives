(LONG)</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Just yoinked this from SB-Stratics guild interview page and trimmed it a little.<br>
Madrin is the interviewer from SB-Stratics, Grenouille is the warlord of The Frost Horde. TFH seem oddly familiar, somehow... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
Madrin: Alright, thanks for staying up late and talking with us at Stratics. Could you please introduce yourself and your guild?<br>
Grenouille: Sure ! My name is Grenouille Bleue, and I'm the leader of the - mostly - European guild: The Frost Horde. The Frost Horde is a gathering of likeminded players who wish to play northerners in the Shadowbane World. This includes barbarians (of course), bards/scalds, warriors of all types, some channelers, runecasters... <br>
Grenouille:...we also have some less typical class, but they all have a roleplayed reason to have joined us. We have a fallen knight, a renegade prelate, a lusting-for-power templar... who all joined the Horde for these different reasons despite not being northerners. <br>
<br>
Grenouille: In Shadowbane, we *do not* plan to be an empire<br>
Grenouille|TFH dramatically stops here<br>
<br>
Grenouille: Our mottos are way more wordly. Our first and main goal is to establish ourselves in the uppermost city, no matter what the cost. This part is considered &quot;pre-roleplay&quot; for us, hence we'll accept all alliances, sell our souls and swords, whatever, to get it. Once we get this town (and, remember, we'll have it)...<br>
Grenouille: ..we'll just do what northerners are well-known for: plunder... and destroy... and pillage... and raid... and plunder. To make a long story short, become a nuisance to be reckoned. <br>
Grenouille|TFH sips some hydromel and awaits the next questions<br>
<br>
Madrin: What's your big plan for Shadowbane, after you get the guild settled in and all? <br>
Grenouille: Like I told you, we have no real dreams of being an empire. We let this for the softlanders. They work, we plunder. <br>
Grenouille|TFH grins<br>
Grenouille: Actually...Once the guild is settled, we'll try to secure our hometown and raid from there. All further sieges won't lead to us extending our dominion. We'll plunder what can be taken, kill those who didn't flee, then set the town to fire (thanks to collateral damage) and retreat. We actually hope to become *cough* more than a minor threat to more peaceful neighbourhoods, and a single hometown is way easier to defend anyway, especially in the North. <br>
<br>
<br>
Madrin: Care to let in those not in the know (like me) about your infamous hydromel? :-) <br>
Grenouille: hehe... sure<br>
Grenouille: well, hydromel is rumored to be the Viking's drink. It's made with very tough ale, sweetened by a drop of honey. I must admit I never tasted some in real life, but we quickly got virtually drunk in our forum and it's now a sort of private joke among us. <br>
Queztacotal: cute<br>
Grenouille: isn't it ? <br>
Madrin: quiet from the peanut gallery! <br>
Grenouille: <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Madrin: This interview is going to ruin my professionalism <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So anyway, next question: Do you think it's feasible for a guild such as yours to survive the long-term? After all, if you succeed in becoming an enemy of everyone you plunder, you'll quickly find yourself in more than a few wars. <br>
Grenouille: Well, that's a very good question (see, your professionalism's still there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ... <br>
Grenouille: Actually, I can only give partial answers since the game isn't released yet. If we actually have the uppermost town, every empire that lies south of us might think twice before throwing his might at us - indeed, this would leave their other front totally open - and we only have one front to care about. Also, we will only have one home town, which hopefully means that it will be a very dangerous place with high walls and such, since all our gold won't need to be split between towns nor our defenders. <br>
Madrin: What if the world is round? <br>
Grenouille: ahh, good question Madrin<br>
Grenouille: If the world is round... we'll have to advise. No better answer, I'm sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, even if a world is round, a secluded town will always have the advantage when it boils down to defense. Besides, I believe it won't be an easy fight for those who want to wipe us... <br>
Grenouille: I think we can kick some butts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And ours are too hairy to be kicked.<br>
Madrin: I suppose the foot would just slide right off, with all the ice frozen to your petootie. Do you plan to make any friends/alliances? <br>
Grenouille: We already have some alliances, mostly with French guilds, that might really set us as a force to be reckoned with. Friends? We might have friends, as well... But remember the motto of the Horde... <br>
Grenouille: Move with us, or Move from us... else, just get trampled. <br>
Grenouille: Most players in our Horde have pride enough that we will prefer painful defeats to destroying our ideals. <br>
<br>
Madrin: Is there anything about the Frost Horde that you want the Shadowbane community to know? <br>
Grenouille: Yup. The Winter will be harsh! We're all merry guys, but don't expect us to behave &quot;good&quot; in game. We won't behave at all... And everything that's on our way shall bend knee or die - actually, the bending knee thingy is so that you can behead them more swiftly. We won't have any mercy. If we die, then we'll die smiling, a mug in our left hand and an axe in the right one, chanting to Torvalt through bubbles of blood...but we'll make sure not to die easily. No, we're not good guys. <br>
Grenouille: I hope this helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Madrin: Will you be making a stiff Scandanavian background to match with Wolfpack's concentration on Norse myth? <br>
Grenouille: Of course! Not only we will, but we already are. Have a look at our website at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://frosthorde.adln.org">frosthorde.adln.org</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and/or check the threads in our forum. The RP spirit is definitely there, and we wish to be the living proof that PvPers can be good roleplayers (or that roleplayers can kick a$$) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Madrin: DEFINITELY a revolutionary concept <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anything you want to add to this? It's rather short, thanks to your answering most of my questions before I ask them, so I'll let you take the reins here if you'd like. <br>
<br>
Grenouille: lol... I'm sorry, even (especially) my guildmembers will tell you that I'm speaking waaaay too much. Nah, there's little to add - only one thing in that I believe we differ of other more organized guilds: rankings and officers. <br>
Grenouille: I expected you to ask the question and had the answer all set, but I babbled too much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so here's the answer anyway although you didn't ask. <br>
Madrin: Alright, fire away. <br>
Grenouille: Aside from me (as the leader), we don't have any officer or leader right now. Why that? All other guilds I've seen seem to already have filled their places. People are Lead officers, Peasants or Peons. I find this just plain wrong. How can you know how someone will behave in a game? It's either plain favoritism, or giving people high title if they apply early. Both have little sense to us. <br>
Grenouille: Hence, guild titles will be handed to players only once they'll make their proof and show their dedication, their leadership skills, this kind of stuff. Shadowbane is likely to be like no other game, hence this stance. <br>
<br>
Grenouille: Besides, this is what makes The Frost Horde such a wonderful pack of rampaging morons with no organization whatsoever - that's the goal, and we reached it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Madrin: And that's why I didn't ask about your structureä you already said you have none <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Grenouille: oooooops<br>
Grenouille: man, i definetely speak TOO MUCH<br>
Grenouille|TFH drowns himself into Hy-dro-mel<br>
Madrin: Hey, it's ok. You're the Frost Horde, not the Frost Empire, right? <br>
Grenouille: Hehe... Horde is the word that fits. I shiver at the thought of building an empire with all the hot-headed guys we have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#CCCCCC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usgean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sgean</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered Patron</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>11/25/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>4:58:56 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/voxton/sgean/sgean-photo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: [SB] Anyone see this guild interview?

It's an odd thing, that people have all these ideas as to have the game will work, prior to them have played it... Who knows if even half the stuff they decide to do, is even possible? <br>
