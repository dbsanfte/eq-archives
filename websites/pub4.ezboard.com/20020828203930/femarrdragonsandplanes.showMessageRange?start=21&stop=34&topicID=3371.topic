Ok, I just couldnt resist responding to this one, as I think there are WAAAAYYY too many people that think like this.<br>
<br>
First off, I am a Bartender/waitress. Yes, it IS my job to get you food and beer. That said, I would like to share with you just exactly what I earn for doing that job. A whooping $2.13 an hour. Now, If everybody who came in to my bar figured it was my job to serve them and didnt think they needed to tip for my time and energy, well, I wouldnt have enough money per month to pay for EQ let alone pay any real bills. If everybody thought like this, every restraunt would be serve your self, because one of the ways restraunts are able to stay open and serve good food at a decent price, is the fact that most of their employees work for almost nothing.<br>
<br>
Please Please remember next time you are out and have someone serving you, they are NOT paid to serve you, unless you pay them for it. And its not an easy job, specially in the bar scenario. That dollor or 2 you give them is nothing but a soda pop from a gas station to you, its a living for them.<br>

Just looked up US minimum wage laws, and I see that the minimum wage is $5.15/hr, unless the employee is getting tips, in which case it reduces to $2.13/hr on the understanding that they get the difference in tips. Bleagh! In countries that don't give employers of bar and wait staff that loophole, there's not as much expectation that a tip will be provided. I'll give a tip in a restaurant only if I thought the service was particularly good. In a quick search for waitressing jobs here in Australia, the first one I found that mentioned a rate of pay was $AUD14/hr. (Call it $US7/hr) Minimum wage in the UK is £4.20 an hour. Ooo.. found a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.exp.ie/advice/mercer.html">list of minimum wages</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> around the world. Probably worth cross-referencing that with <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.finfacts.com/costofliving.htm">costs of living</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.

The term &quot;donation&quot; has pretty much always been misused. By definition, it's strictly voluntary, yet these days a lot of people mean it's required.<br>
<br>
In grade school, I got in trouble for not donating to the poor box (I'm 7 years old... where the hell am I gonna get money from?)<br>
<br>
At my parent's church, they try and encourage the people there to donate at least 10% of their wages to the church.<br>
<br>
That's crap. If someone wants to donate, they decide 2 things.<br>
<br>
1. Yes or no.<br>
2. How much.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this is one of those things that goes round and round with no actual resolution. <br>
<br>
Now, on the subject of tipping. If I get the food myself, I usually don't tip (except for change... I hate change, but that doesn't really count). So basically, I don't pay much attention to the tip jars at the register. However, if I the food is brought to me, then I always tip at least the customary 15%. If the server is someone who has served me a few times in the past before, then I tip a little more. If they have to deal with assholes at another table that I can see, then I usually try and tip a little more as well. Granted, all this goes out the window if the service sucks (never had that happened though). <p><p><center><a href=http://www.saraquael.com><img src=http://www.saraquael.com/Images/signature2002.jpg></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarayalebon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Araya LeBon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/3/02 12:05:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3371.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: donations</span><hr size=1> "?

I don't think whoever said this was talking about waiters/servers.  He's talking about the coffee shops and stores that have the jar out front.  These people DO get paid minimum wage+.  They are basically a glorified Taco Bell employee.  I pay them at the counter, they get me coffee, I sit down.  I clean up my own mess.  No reason to tip them at all. <p><a target="Varanuss Albigularis " href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46329

I've been fighting with my wife for years that you shouldn't give a truly terrible waiter 20% tips, maybe not even 10%, but zero percent. Great service usually gets a good tip, even if the food isn't always so great. Food and other services have become a bit complicated, though. Some places have one person seat you, another get your drinks, a third get your order, and a fourth bring out the food. Who gets the tip, and why? Generally if I place the food order, and get my own drinks, then I don't tip for just carrying food to my table. On the other hand, if I have the cash I tend to tip delivery personnel pretty well, especially considering their limited role in the deal.<br>
<br>
  How about a buffet setting, where the waitress gets your drinks, but you get all food yourself? What the heck are you tipping for? I'm still undecided on that one, especially when the restaurant is a mix of buffet and regular orders. Then there's the cafeteria, where you get all the food and drinks yourself, but some lady asks if everything's all right. Thanks, I don't need any condiments, and you aren't getting money for that offer. It's very difficult being new to the planet and trying to figure out tipping rules, let me tell you! (Especially the pseudo hidden tipping for baggage handlers and the like. What, we need to hide it from the IRS? Muggers? I'm confuzzled.)<br>
<br>
  Back to the original topic (at last), while I have provided druid services for donations, I don't entirely agree with your interpretation. That definition of donation, purely optional, works on larger scale groups, but not as well on the individual level. While I have in fact teleported people and more for free, I can certainly see the use of donation meaning: &quot;you the service requester decide the payment, but there will be one&quot;. I have received gold and silver and other barely valuable amounts with little more than a few extra eyeblinks. <br>
<br>
  The major reasons for the overuse of the word donation, however, are to avoid public criticism of rates, and to avoid setting a ceiling on the amount received. Some people have taken offense at being asked for money for services. I still fondly remember earning money at level 14 at the WFP gates, sowing and buffing and binding people for donations. After a few too many very glittery people gave me nothing, I changed my offer to require payment (though I was still sowing people on CR for free, usually as they appeared in front of me.) One very high level lady gave me money for a bind, but said it would have been much more had I not set a price. I responded with my woes and we discussed that briefly.<br>
<br>
  Basically, everyone wants to be paid for providing a service in game. Many of us accept payment in nonmonetary measures. I much prefer a good discussion, or a good roleplayer chat, to 10 or 100pp. I'd rather an effusive thank you, even if I don't really know what effusive means as a non-human lifeform. (Perhaps I meant effulgent? Effigy? Oh well.) I do agree that most people should say &quot;for money, damn you!&quot;, but then they miss out on the option for items. I've gotten a few items, mostly junk, for teleports. Sometimes I take items, but usually I don't want it taking up valuable vegetable space.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Pardon my lengthy whimsy, or correct my grammar. Either way, it's lunch time.<br>

<br>
While I do agree with you Neebo, it is also very important to note that you are stealing from the waiter/ress if you do not leave a tip. By US law, waitstaff must claim 8% of thier total orders of the night as potential &quot;income&quot; assumed by the IRS.<br>
<br>
Of course to play devil's advocate... if they average 20% on a good night they are only required to claim less then half thier income... :P <p><TABLE STYLE="filter: shadow(color=Blue, strength=7)" width="268" height="9"><TR><TD width="260" height="5"><p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">"W.W.I.D.?"<br>"(What Would Innoruuk Do?)"</font>

Great thread nonetheless for us magic illiterate melee types. I never know what is an acceptable tip or donation- and I'll walk 99% of the time anyhoo. Come to think of it the only ports I've ever really recieved were from real life friends or guildies I was all ready grouped with. <br>
<br>
I would expect to pay something, but unless the porters advertise the acceptable &quot;donation,&quot; many of us won't even bother replying.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uneebbo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neebbo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/5/02 9:19:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3371.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Because some people just don't understand English</span><hr size=1> &quot;While I do agree with you Neebo, it is also very important to note that you are stealing from the waiter/ress if you do not leave a tip. By US law, waitstaff must claim 8% of thier total orders of the night as potential &quot;income&quot; assumed by the IRS.&quot;<br>
<br>
  That's nice, but that's not really my problem. (Also, it's Neebbo, two bs, dang it.) It's not stealing for me to withhold money when there was no agreement between me and waiter type that there would be a tip. It might be an implied situation that &quot;any reasonable&quot; person would leave a tip, but there's no set amount or even percentage. (One exception being those restaurants that print on their menus about gratuities added to large parties, but then it's forced onto the bill.)<br>
<br>
  Room service is another good one. I forget where I stayed a while back, but they added a tip to the bill, but left a place where you could increase the tip. Fine, but he's got his 15% and you think I should add more? Maybe if I were the demanding type and wanted unusual condiments or sent him back for things, I'd consider it. Wheeling a cart and moving a few dishes around doesn't sound like enough work to me.<br>
<br>
  Lest I sound like a total skinflint, I've been known to overtip for very entertaining, nice, or attentive waiters. On cheaper meals I've tipped more than the meal(s) cost a few times. I donated fairly well at a recent Rennaisance Festival for the two performances I liked a lot, even though both shows admitted to receiving pay already. With a hundred people per show, I was certainly under less pressure to donate.<br>

<br>
  That's a good point. The same problem exists on the people who demand, request, or ask nicely for ports. Sometimes they don't even mention if they plan to pay. Other times it's paying, donation, or my favorite, &quot;paying well&quot;. (Paying well could be 5pp or 200pp. If you like bad gambles, go for it.) Generally you can get away with 10pp as the minimum, but a lot of greedier porters will scoff at less than 100pp. <br>
<br>
  Personally, these days I just don't bother to port much. High pp amounts only let me know how serious the person is in their request; I don't need money because I don't have quite enough item desire or hope to try buying much. I do accept money as proof that my services are worth something. <br>
<br>
  You should just counter with your port request and name a figure. If someone responds, fine, if not you can raise your price or keep running. In fact, most of my alts never buy teleports. My warrior has run, unsowed, from Misty Thicket (original bind point) to Great Divide on CR. He hates that Iceclad boat and Iceclad in general. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usejaltraurig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sejal Traurig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/5/02 10:28:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3371.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Because some people just don't understand English</span><hr size=1> Frankly, I don't understand what Guildon is complaining about.<br>
<br>
Casting X for donations means just exactly that. Donate. Get the offered spell cast. Don't donate, you get nothing. That is, as near as I can tell, as plain English as it can get. Donate. Get something. Don't Donate. Get nothing. Easy. Simple. Clear.<br>
<br>
What Guildon is REALLY saying is: &quot;I'm a cheap bastard that wants something for nothing. No I'm not going to give you anything for your time. Buff/Port me and appreciate the fact that you got to be nice to me. Maybe I'll let you buff/port me again later.&quot;<br>
<br>
See, I cast C3 for donations quite frequently. I've been given as much as 260 plat for a single person. I've also accepted and cast for as little as 3 plat for a person. Price isn't the issue when it comes to a donation. Someone said something like 'people who use the word donation instead of setting a price just don't want to sound like port whores'.. Not so in my case. There is one reason and one reason alone that I do not set a price. Allow me to explain.<br>
<br>
When someone asks me &quot;How much for C3?&quot; I reply (And yes.. I type it out every time because its too damned long for a hotkey) &quot;I have no set price. Donate what you feel it is worth to you to get a Clarity 3 with 25 int and 25 wis that also increases your mana pool by 250 and lasts for 2.5 hours.&quot; (Lucky for me I type fast, so I can usually get one sent before the next person asks me the same question).. So I say Donation NOT because I want to avoid sounding like a buff whore.. But because, plain and simple, its WORTH more to some people than it is to others.. <br>
<br>
People have said &quot;This is all I have with me.. Is that enough?&quot; The ONLY times I have EVER said &quot;No, you need to get more&quot; was when an Epic Cleric tried giving me 130 SILVER. I turned down the silver.. But the cleric STILL GOT C3.. I said &quot;If thats all you can afford, you need it more than I do&quot;<br>
<br>
Another time I turned down someone who asked me to C3 him and gave me 20 plat.. Then all of a sudden a bunch more people from the same guild as him showed up. I invited him to join my group because I could see what was coming.. He donated for HIM.. But wanted C3 for his entire group.. Well, I'm willing to cast on the guy because he donated, but he refused to join my group.. He says &quot;I donated for the entire group.. Can you hurry it up? We are on our way to a raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now keep in mind, when he sent me a tell asking if I could C3 &quot;HIM&quot; (He said nothing about his entire group) I had around 15 seconds to finish camping out.. So.. I cancelled the camp and waited.. And waited.. And waited.. for him to get there (See, he wasn't even in the same ZONE yet) While I was waiting I /ooc'ed &quot;Casting C3 for donations at the Kunark Scion..&quot; I manged to make a little plat while waiting on the guy..<br>
<br>
So I gave the guy his money back and he went on his way (I assume to the raid he was talking about) all pissed off at me because I wouldn't C3 his entire group for 20 plat after having been made to wait as long as I was to do HIM a favor.<br>
<br>
So spare me the English Language speech.. Saying &quot;I'll do something in return for something else&quot; (I.E. an exchange of cash) is pretty plain. In ANY language.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3371.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3371.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3371.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3371.topic&index=34><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3371.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3371.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3371.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3371.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
