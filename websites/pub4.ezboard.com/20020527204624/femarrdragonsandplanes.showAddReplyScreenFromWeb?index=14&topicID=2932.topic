<br>
a man's penis does not dictate whether he is nice or not.<br>
<br>
A man with a small dick can be as much an ass as someone with a large one. <br>
<br>
As for me, I consider myself a semi decent nice guy type. And I know I don't have a large dick. But from what I hear women say. Big dicks fucking hurt. Now how can you enjoy sex if it's constant pain?<br>
<br>
Unless you're a fetishist that is.<br>

Let's just say it's normal and enjoyable, as for what women have told me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/26/02 12:14:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2932.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What do women want?</span><hr size=1> Even Freud could not answer that question.<br>
<br>
I think you might get some insight if you see that movie with Russel Crowe<br>
about the Math guy who goes insane.<br>
<br>
If your good at empathy - try looking at the situation from the female's side.<br>
You usually wont like what you see.<br>
<br>
To assume that the female knows what she wants or what she is doing is<br>
a mistake. She 'might' but it is hardly a given.<br>
<br>
The more attractive the female is the more jaded she 'usually' is and it sounds<br>
like you dont like jaded women.<br>
The female becomes jaded when she realizes (quite early for some sadly)<br>
that just about every male she meets wants to have sex with her.<br>
(Of course that isnt ALL we want but yes sooner or later we WILL want that)<br>
<br>
Humans have an innate drive for 'elite-ism' we all want to think we are not part<br>
of the unwashed masses. In women that manifests as selecting the 'challenging'<br>
targets. If you convince her that 'YOU' are hard to get, your halfway there.<br>
Or if you convince them that you are special or well heeled.<br>
<br>
You can identify some such women by certain 'give away' lines they will say, like...<br>
'I dont see what is wrong with a room full of goodlooking people'<br>
(usually said when trying to tell you to take a bath)<br>
or<br>
'He doesnt need to know that'<br>
(if a woman is willing to cheat at ALL, she will cheat on you also...dont think your special, cause it aint true, drill her and dump her ASAP)<br>
or<br>
'Its just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it is a poor man'<br>
(start running)<br>
<br>
Such women have an internal agenda and you will be FOREVER measured against<br>
some standard that you cant see, and cant refute. You are wasting your time, UNLESS... you smply wish to get laid. In this case simply lie to them to convince them that you may be what they want. If you manage to do that they will fall<br>
right over. However remember that she will be angry when ther truth surfaces.<br>
<br>
The sad truth is this. If you cant offer her something better than what she has,<br>
your doomed. Would you leave under the same circumstance? It is a transactional<br>
dynamic. Also remember that the more attractive the female is the easier YOU<br>
are to replace. There are no more truer words than these. Billy Joel is a case in point. <br>
<br>
Also remember that a woman who commits expects to be supported. This doesnt<br>
ALWAYS mean money. It means that you provide something she wants.<br>
If you stop doing that things wont go well. She may want something that you<br>
are unaware of also.<br>
<br>
This doesnt mean you cant dally with various types of women:<br>
It sickened me when (once I got married) I suddenly started getting<br>
all kinds of bizzare signals from my freinds spouses. I suggest you NEVER<br>
make the mistake of being alone in a secluded spot with a freinds spouse,<br>
you may get more than you thought you ever wanted.<br>
The usual motive is validation/loneliness.<br>
Even a trophy wife gets tired of being on display, maybe especially them.<br>
Women want to know that they can still command attention, and the easiest<br>
way to find out is to tempt some poor fool. Dont be fooled, unless your into<br>
that kind of thing, some men are....makes no difference to ME, I dont play that game.<br>
<br>
The BEST choice of a potencial girlfreind/spouse/sackmate is to pick the female<br>
that NEEDS you. Ok how do you know? Just ask her. Ask her what she needs in her life. She WILL tell you. Women LOVE to talk about themselves. Just nod polietly<br>
and listen to the cues. She will assume your considerate and a fantastic conversationalist. Then all you need to do is become the person she said she needed. that is all there is to it.  Shallow YES but effective.<br>
Women DONT WANT ENTAGLEMENTS. Keep it simple.<br>
If she ever thinks your dependant on her your dead. Its that simple. Pull up stakes<br>
and slip out quietly.<br>
<br>
I am not interested in if it seems that men do the same crap...I am NOT interested in men. So how THEY act simply doesnt matter to me. That is the WOMANS provance.<br>
<br>
Marylin Monroe gave real insight into the REAL male/female dynamic when she said:<br>
'If I stay in Indiana? men will still want to get into my pants. If I go to Hollywood<br>
its the same way. If Im lying Im dying. Why should I give it away to a farmer<br>
when I can use it to further a career?'<br>
<br>
I cant refute that logic. I really wish I could. Because from MY point of view,<br>
If everyone can have something, then it has no value. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerrolthefury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerrol The Fury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Smartass™</span><br>  Posts: 574<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/26/02 1:05:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2932.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What do women want?</span><hr size=1> Chiteng is nearly dead-on in his assesment.

The part about the best female being one that needs you, especially.  I used to NEED my boyfriends... and I drove them absolutely insane because I was expecting them to cater to all my needs that I should have been taking care of myself.  Trust me, a woman who needs you is likely going to decide eventually that you could use some &quot;tweaking...&quot; those women rarely, that I've seen, can accept the man they need as he is, rather then as we want him to be.<br>
<br>
The most fun kind of woman, imo, is the one who doesn't need anyone... she knows what she wants and she knows she's got the power to get it herself.  But she wants you.  That's the kind of girl that'll give you the ride of your life. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

is talking about.<br>
Also a woman that needs no one, doesnt need ME. I dont like to have to keep<br>
'performing' to stay on top of the dynamic. There are too many other men who will<br>
do just as well or better.<br>
<br>
The fact is that in what we call 'adult' relationships a different dynamic start to intrude. Women resent the fact that 'if' they allow the man to have sex with them,<br>
then the male feels he has a 'claim' on them. Tough, its instinctive.<br>
You see from the MALE point of view we want to STOP looking for a woman.<br>
We just want to HAVE one. Period. She is there we are comforted and then we go back to doing whatever we were doing that entertains us. Women resent that<br>
and strive to make us 'uneasy'. I hate that game. I wont play it.<br>
<br>
I dont understand WHY women insist on defining themselves by their relationships<br>
with men! Why? Do you see men doing that? NO YOU DONT. We have to define<br>
ourselves by our productivity and usefullness. Lets see women start doing that.<br>
<br>
See that is why men like 'young' women and 'older' women resent that.<br>
'Young' women are FAR more pliable and MUCH easier to make happy.<br>
Also sadly older women tend to carry alot of emotional baggage. I didnt create<br>
it and I wont deal with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreadwolfff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreadwolfff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/26/02 2:17:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2932.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I for one cant believe you actually responded to creepis post. <br>
<br>
Its blantently obvious the thing that   wrote the post has no actuall experience in a relationship..but then being 12 years old  of course he would know all the answers to to every problem that ever came up between the genders. <br>
<br>
Back to the original post....<br>
<br>
Well ..fact is men age gracefully. As we get older the term <br>
distingusted is used. We seen to become more attractive as we get older. <br>
<br>
Women on the other hand ..well to put it bluntly ...Don't.<br>
<br>
This is societies view BTW ...not mine <br>
<br>
Women can be shit hot ...till the hit ohhhh..30 or so then we swap places. Men ...around 30 have pretty good carreers in general ..stable income , reasonable looks , even grew out  the jerk stage to become humanbeings.<br>
<br>
Women on the other hand around 30..well everythng gets a little loose ..gravity takes its toll...they had their babies. In alot of cases their carreer and independance was give up for the family. <br>
<br>
Round 35 - 40... if no kids around to keep you together, then your both off looking for some new candy or none at all.<br>
<br>
Matters of the heart cant be explained , the answers not rational nor easy to accept. I guess you have to be true to one person ..yourself. <br>
<br>
I wouldnt worry about the pretty girls on the arms of the pretty guys. There are  &quot;Normal &quot; people everywhere.<br>
<br>
As for the second topic that came up ...<br>
<br>
NO ONE deserves to be hit .... for any reason. <br>
<br>
A man that uses his pysical strength to dominate a partner, thru violence or the threat of ..is the lowest form of life on this planet. There is only one lower person around someone that agrees with the use of it. <br>
<br>
No middle ground here ...you just dont  do it !!!!!<br>
<br>
Sooo creepi when your testicles actually drop and your voice<br>
breaks...and all that nasty acne disappears  maybe one day<br>
you will work it out for yourself. Untill that time please do us <br>
all a favor and just dont post bullshit. <br>
<br>
Cause guys like you need some serious sence beaten into you <br>
as it the only thing you recognize ..violence. <br>
<br>
Break the cycle on dometic violence ... just dont do it. <br>
(even if daddy did give mum a &quot;clip&quot; around the ear )<br>

That's what I mean.  The kind of NEED I'm talking about is when women feel that they aren't enough without a man, and then they start clinging on him desperately.  You're absolutely right, we should start defining ourselves by productivity and usefulness, rather then by whatever man we're with.   Maybe the kind of need you're talking about is when a woman truly loves you.  I don't know... I don't think I've ever loved someone in that way, and I don't think I've been loved that way myself.  But I have been the first type... and trust me, it's an absolutely terrible thing to inflict on yourself and the man you're with.  <br>

Your relationships are your concern, of course, but it seems to me that just about everyone has shit to deal with.  What kind of relationship are you looking for where you won't deal with any &quot;emotional baggage&quot; because you &quot;didn't create it.&quot;  You want a woman who needs you, but you don't want to be there for her if she has problems that you didn't create?  Maybe I'm misunderstanding you.  <br>

I'm a young woman, 22, but I've definitely been burned, and I'm going to be carrying the lessons I learned with me to my next relationship.  In my particular case, that means that I may over-react if I think I'm being patronized, and that I'll likely leave immediately if my boyfriend shows a hint of violence.  I dealt with that in the past, and I won't do it again.  Doesn't everyone have stuff like that from their past that they carry around with them?  You're shaped by your past.  It helps define whoever you turn out to be.<br>

I find the situation you described as sad as you do.  When I talked about a woman needing a man, that's the kind of thing I meant.  That kind of bad need.... she became totally dependent on that guy and its a shame.<br>
<br>
Um, Creepi... no doubt you're jacking off right about now because of the excitement of all the attention you're getting, but I can't resist pointing out one minor thing.  You sat there and called people hypocrites for pointing out grammatical errors, and then you, um, searched through my post looking for grammatical errors.  /boggle.  The really sad thing is that the only &quot;error&quot; you found in my post was not even an error.  But they probably haven't taught you much English in school yet.  Please, just do the world a favor and don't breed.  Continue spurting onto your Britney Spears poster; we're all safer that way.<br>

It's interesting to think about and yet disheartening to someone like myself to think that I have to be used by a woman in order to have a partner in life. You're right when you say that men are looking for a someone to have and love. <br>
<br>
I have met women that fit your steretype of jaded alot, and that is also disheartening to see it's wide spread. <br>
<br>
I had always been raised to think it was a woman who needed a man in her life and a man who was afraid of commitment because it would tie them down to one person. In some cases that's still true. But more and more I'm seeing a role-reversal taking place. Where a man just wants someone and the woman wants more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 982<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/26/02 5:48:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2932.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Indeed</span><hr size=1> Strange that you would mention a post count with my name since they seem to be much more important to you.  5 posts in a row?

<br>
The female knew she would hurt you.<br>
She knew it before she did it.<br>
She did it anyway.<br>
It is NEVER enough to stop them, THEY ALWAYS do it anyway.<br>
That is the true difference between men and women.<br>
<br>
See one reason is that women do not wish to be dominated/dependant<br>
(at least conciously)<br>
one way to prove to themselves that they are truely independant is to cheat.<br>
Its a self-respect dynamic.<br>
<br>
One woman that I am good freinds with said that it is a case of 'letting it happen'<br>
she said that there was no intent but that it just happened.<br>
I say that is pure 100% bullshit. Reach down into your heart and pull out the hate.<br>
Judge her as you know she would have judged YOU.<br>
I am sure she knew that it would finish the relationship with you, and the guilt<br>
of it drove her to try and terminate easy. But she lied. Not explicitly NO,<br>
such lies are rare and usually forced. She lied by ommision. She tried to<br>
hand you a reality that wasnt real. She didnt give you the truth.<br>
And why didnt she? because then SHE hurts too, and she doesnt want to.<br>
Its a selfish bullshit thing women do. Another thing, cheating is a behavioral pattern. Some women dont, some do. those that DO will do it again, and for the same reason. I saw a bride cheat on her groom at her own wedding!!!<br>
I tried to warn him, it did no good whatever. The fool didnt WANT to hear it.<br>
So I lose one female aquaintance I dont need, and a male freind. They did eventually seperate, I dont know if they divorced.<br>
<br>
<br>
Have any of you guys even listened to 3+ women talking? It is a TRUE<br>
eyeopener. They compare notes on EVERYTHING. There is NOTHING you do to her or with her that she doesnt share (unless its illegal)<br>
Guys dont do that. At least none that I know. Its considered 'tacky'.<br>
<br>
Of course once the relationship is OVER then the lid comes off =)<br>
<br>
What is truely mind boggling is that they really do these horrible pain causing things<br>
and they have no true reason for doing it. What do you say to a woman who cheats on her husband at a Office party???? Then she goes home and pretends it never happened?????? Like he wont hear about it???<br>
<br>
We poor bastard males are NEVER willing to admit the horrid truth until someone<br>
shoves it down our throats. We lie to ourselves constantly. We lie to the point that we look stupid to everyone around us. Dont count on your freinds to tell you.<br>
They WONT. Even if they did you would refuse to believe it.<br>
<br>
The ONLY solution to the problem is to adopt the same mindset. DONT ever fall in true love. If the girl is a mercenrary use her and dump her and LAUGH in her face.<br>
The reality is that women consider 'nice' guys milksops. They dont respect us.<br>
You have to get MEAN. I am sorry guys but its true. I wish it wasnt that way.<br>
You have to train yourself to not care about what she 'may' do. Only then will<br>
you be free. I dont mean to pretend to not care either, I mean to NOT CARE.<br>
<br>
If she really IS a nice girl then walk away and leave her alone. Then get down on your hands and knees and thank god that you<br>
actually met one. Dont worry however, they dont stay nice.<br>
<br>
The sad fact is that sometimes women just want attention, and sometimes they<br>
will use that to get it. Women have very few good bribes. That one will usually work.<br>
