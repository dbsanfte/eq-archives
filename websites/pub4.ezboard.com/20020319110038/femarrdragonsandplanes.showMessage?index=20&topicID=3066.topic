Aren't you crazy for killing someone? I mean could someone of sound mind do such an act? To kill a person is to be insane. And by that same fact noone should get off with a little insanity plea. Give them what they deserve and in this case I agree with ana Hang them for all to see.<br>

Have you ever been inside a prison?  Or stayed there?  I have gone there as part of ministry efforts and let me tell you it sucks when you know you are going home Sunday.  What do you see a movie or a TV show that says 'cable and tennis courts' and think it's a joy ride?  Imagine spending your life living with strangers being told what to do and when to do it - when you can wake up and go to bed - and also remember - you never leave the building you are in - ever.  Prison is not some country club - yes I'm sure there are exceptions but not many.<br>
<br>
2.  Did you know that most of the criminals in the prison system are there for drug offenses?  Did you know that if you are married to someone that transports a drug accross state lines - even if you didn't know it - that you go to jail automatically for 10 years (assuming they are busted).  There is no trial there - there is no sentencing - if your spouse gets busted and convicted you get AUTOMATIC 10 years.  Ok don't bust on the prison system - bust on the crappy laws that we let run this country and then wonder why our prisons are overcrowded.<br>
<br>
3.  If you think death is the answer I hope you are forced to kill every inmate.  If you are a christian I surely hope that you believe 'judge not lest ye be judged'.  If you are a Wiccan there would be no way in hell you go by 'an it harm none'.  I don't know any mainstream (satanism being not mainstream in any way) where you can find an excuse to kill people.<br>
<br>
4.  It is more expensive to kill someone than to just keep them locked up.  Why?  Appeals... and appeals... and etc.  You know what - HOW MANY DEATH ROW INNMATES HAVE BEEN LET GO BECAUSE THEY WERE PROVEN INNOCENT BY DNA IN THE LAST 5 YEARS?  I'll give you a hint - the answer is greater than 1 and that's just in my state of Illinois.  I sure as well hope that if I were put on death row for a crime I didn't do that I had the chance to prove myself before someone pulled a trigger without thinking because 'swift' justice leaves the sense of vengance and satisfaction to those who want to have rage in thier hearts.<br>
<br>
This topic makes me sick - the woman was sick - the killing of the children was sick - the lust for HER blood makes me sick, and the thought that our prison systems that go by the code 'let 10 guilty men go free than punish one innocent' is 'too easy'.  I won't claim we are perfect.... but we are damn sure better than other places.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah... on another note - just think if we handed over every one of those prisoners in Cuba to the Afgans for punishment - they would have seen a .45 about 30 mins after they were handed over - in between the eyes.  Yes we are so merciful we give people life.  That's what God gives everyone.<br>
<br>
And if you believe in God - you also believe he has the power to kill/stop anyone on this earth at any time.  If he wanted someone dead - he'd do it.  Don't think you know more than he... or she... or it... or whoever/whatever you pray to.<br>

<br>
Simply you are not thinking about that sort of thing when you go insane.<br>
<br>
The only deterent to crime is a higher prosecution rate. People are more scared of 5 years in prison for something they think they will get caught for then the death sentence for something they think dont think they will get caught for.<br>
<br>
I believe the figures were 37 years incarceration, considering bulk buying of food, and group accomodation, is the same cost as the death sentence ( including accomodation till death ) Are we going to have to have an actuary attempt to determine what is most cost effective?<br>
<br>
Calling the police afterwards is actually evidence that she is insane as opposed to evidence that she is not. Sane people rarely try to get caught.<br>
<br>
I don't see how anyone can say this is not clearly a matter of diminished capacity.<br>
<br>
People who avoid the death sentence do not go free. Never has this happened in the USA or UK. These people go through lengthy counselling in secured institutions, commonly with large doses of Thorazine and rubber wallpaper.<br>
<br>
The Catholic Church does not condone murder of one's children.<br>
<br>
I will not support the death sentence whilst there is any issue of making a mistake in any criminal court. This is across the board, and because of that I believe you should not have a death sentence for any case, no matter if the defendant pleads guilty.<br>
<br>
We abolished the death sentence in the UK over a hundred years ago. The murder rate here has gone down since then in relation to the overall population of the country.<br>

It's also worth noting that the UK has an overall lower per capita crime rate than the United States, despite not using public caning or other stupid shit.  Hell, some of their cops don't even carry guns.  The point being that brutality is not necessarily the way to reduce the crime rate.  The facts don't lie, and in this case they're pretty simple and easy to understand.<br>

You are able to say that someone should die? What this person did?? She killed people. What would you doing if you were the jury? You would kill someone. Where is the difference?<br>
<br>
I can undertand the anger of someone losing a parent, a kid from a murder. I cant understand the murderer. I cant forgive him either. But I will never kill him. <br>
<br>
By condemning someone to death is exactly a murder to me. Those people doing that are acting the same way of the people they are judging.<br>
<br>
Self defence, war are different things. Judging with a cool brain that someone should be killed is exactly the same as killing someone. So, we should condemn all jury voting death penalty and kill them too. <br>

<br>
I agree with you.  I read an article yesterday about a man who had been in prison for 5 years (for rape?) and a DNA test cleared him of the crime.  I think it is positively wonderful that our science is progressing to this point to better ensure we get &quot;the right man&quot;.<br>
<br>
However, that is not the case here.  This woman murdered five innocent children.  There is a reason our society has laws to govern what happens to people that kill other people.  Do you know how many murderers actually commit the crime, yet get off the hook due to their lawyers calling an insanity plea?  Perhaps you should check.<br>
<br>
These people do not need to be roaming around the streets being a danger to anyone that might &quot;trip her trigger&quot;.  If it would ease your conscience, keep her locked up.  Why waste money.  <br>
<br>
Science has not progressed to the point where we can safely say, &quot;Yes, I can cure that person of her illness and then she will no longer be a danger to anyone else&quot;.  All we can do is dope them up in a mental institute until they die.  Why waste money. <p><table rules=none border=0><tr><td><img src="http://www.clanbattleaxe.com/mine/siilver.jpg"></td><td><font face="comic sans ms" size=2">

Lock her up forever.  If she is found not guilty by reason of insanity, she isn't going home.  That's a misconception on the part of the general due to the terminology of &quot;not guilty&quot; and the arguments by the vested interest of death penalty proponents<br>
<br>
The problem is that we can't justify the death penalty for those cases of admission or irrebutable evidence of guilt, when we continue to use it in numerous cases where the evidence is circumstantial and capable of being wrong.  17 people were let off of death row in Illinois a few years back, leading to the moratorium there by a Republican Governor.<br>

Until there is a 100% foolproof way of determining guilt, death is too high a punishment in cases where we could be wrong. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulorentic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lorentic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/20/02 2:14:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> My 2 cents:<br>

If a "Sane" individual murders another individual NOT in self defense or the defense of another whom is in fatal danger, then TERMINATE that individual.  Do not waste money on prison, do not let them out of jail, etc, etc.  This person has PROVEN a threat to society.  End the threat with extreme prejudice.<br>

If an "Insane" individual murders another individual NOT in self defense or the defense of another whom is in fatal danger, then TERMINATE that individual.  Do not waste money on prison OR treatment, do not let them out of jail, etc, etc.  This person has PROVEN a threat to society.  End the threat with extreme prejudice.  Mental state is no excuse for fatal crimes with no foundation.  If they are insane enought to murder in cold blood, why do they deserve treatment?<br>
<br>
PROBLEM:  the US legal system is not dependable.  Captitol punsihment is difficult to enforce at best in crimes where guilt is marginally proven.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER:  This person admitted to it, we know she did.  Kill her the way she killed them.  Drown her on Public television.  Cruel?  Well, perhaps after that people will pay MORE attention to the mental state of their family members and spouses.  MAYBE it will deter sane people from using a false fuckin plea.  <br>
<br>
NOTE: " Sane " and " Insane " are entirely too relative to define and therefore should not be applicable in legal proceedings.  What the Romans, the "craddle of civilization" did in their spare time when not murdering and raping nearby military targets would be considered inhumane and insane by the current definition.<br>

She KNEW she was committing a crime.<br>
<br>
Based upon what we know, she wasn't hallucinating when she killed them. She didn't think they were attacking her, or confuse them with vermin. No messages from God or the mothership.<br>
<br>
She KNEW who they were, when she killed them.<br>
<br>
Did her husband arrive home to find her knitting some socks and trying to wake up the children from their nap? <br>
<br>
She KNEW they were dead, and that she had done it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The question isn't whether or not she's fucking nuts. I think that's pretty clear. The question is whether or not she knew what she was doing, and whether or not she was able to control herself. That's the insanity defense.<br>
<br>
She controlled herself long enough to wait until her husband was gone, controlled herself long enough to drown four children and then chase the fifth around the house, and knew enough about what she'd done to call the police as soon as she was finished.<br>
<br>
<br>
Crazy? Yeah, duh. Psychotic? I'm not so sure. I hear she's got an affect flatter than a pancake.<br>
<br>
Crazy enough not to be held responsible? Not from the information I've seen. Unless something is being held back, I doubt I'd support the insanity plea if I were on the stand.<br>
<br>
It serves no purpose to execute her, but I don't think she was out of control when she killed those kids. She knew what she was doing, and she knew it was wrong.<br>
<br>
Having a DSM-IV dx doesn't absolve her. <br>

If a person kills another person they are (as far as I'm concerned) insane.  No questions asked, they are in no way, shape, or form sane.  No sane person would commit an act as heinous knowing full well that 1) it is immoral, and 2) it is illegal.  Insanity should not be a valid plea in any court since the fact that you killed someone automatically proves you to be insane.  Insane or not you should be punished.  That whole &quot;fit of rage&quot; arguement holds no weight with me.  I have done some things in &quot;fits of rage&quot; before, and all of them stopped short of harming another person.  I've pinned people to the ground and told them to leave other people the fuck alone, I have even grabbed someone by the throat and told them to fuck off, but I have never actually hurt another person physically before realising what was going on.  I can see people with weaker minds actually hitting someone before realising wtf is happening, but no way in hell can you drown 5 children 1 at a time, placing the bodies of the ones that are dead on your bed in the other room and moving on to the next child a &quot;fit of rage&quot; act.  It is a premeditated and inexcusable act of murder and should be treated as such. <p><b><i>Your resident troll</i></b><BR>Aphroditex Bubblefists;  Serenity Z'Chaotic; Pickett Pocketts<BR>

Grrr....<br>
Anti-choice propaganda really pisses me off.<br>
Government stay out of my uterus.<br>
If you're against abortion, don't have one.<br>
My body, my choice.<br>
If you can't trust me with the choice, how can trust me with the child.<br>
Every child a wanted child.<br>
There.  Pro-choice propaganda for you.  Just to even things out.<br>
IMHO, murder of any kind is immoral.  Chances are I wouldn't have an abortion, but I refuse to make that decision for anybody else.  An unwanted child is the saddest thing ever.<br>

Kill the murderous woman and be done with it. As a tax payer I don't want to spend 20k a year for 20+ years keeping an admitted killer alive and healthy. Perhaps drowning in a tub would be a just punishment? <p> <img src=http://home.swbell.net/dawson70/upload_jpeg4.jpg><br>
