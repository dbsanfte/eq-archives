I was over in the DL with her and shouted out that I was doing ports for donations.  I received a tell from 2 people asking me to come to the entrance of KC and give them ports.  Kantiz was the first one to make the request.  He said that he was needing a port to Feerrott to meet up for a Planes raid, and since I could both levitate and camo myself I was glad to help out. Once I got to KC entrance I saw Kantiz and invited him into group along with the other player.  Kantiz was fighting a drolvarg and I asked him to join group so that I could quickly port us out of there before I died since I was a aggro magnet at lvl 35.  He was a bit slow in joining and I was aggroed and killed.  I was not upset as death is a common and expected thing.  A level 52 rez was gotten for me *which cost ME 100p* I apologized to Kantiz and the other player for the delay and told them that I would port as soon as the rez effects wore off and I had the mana for the ports.  Kantiz responce to my apology was &quot;doh you can't port while rez effects are on you?&quot;  I explained no that I couldn't and then once I had mana I ported out.  Kantiz zoned faster than me, and once I made it through the zone he had already disbanded from group.  Not only did he leave the group before I zoned in, but he also NEVER DONATED, and when I asked him *only because I was offended at his actions*  he said he had to go because he was in a hurry to get to the portal for the Planes Raid.  I told him that not only did I go out of my way to help him with his port, but I had also died and it cost me 100p for a rez, and he still didn't have the courtesy to make some sort of donation.  WTF is up with that?  Why are people so selfish and uncaring?  I sat there for over 30 minutes before porting myself back to WC and that raid was still in the process of being put together.  It wasn't like he was in a life or death situation, and I am sure that he would have been included in the list of people for the groups because he had already told me that they were waiting on him.  This is totally out of the normal for me to make a post because I am a very quiet person.  I go out of my way to help people with all my characters, but I am sick and tired of selfish people like Kantiz doing stuff like this.  I do ports all the time for people that say they have no money, and I do not mind, but his actions were uncalled for and they were the breaking point of my silence on this matter.  Oh by the way, the other player donated 12p for his port, and though that was a small donation even after my death it was still a donation and much appreciated.  Remember what goes around comes around.  Ok I am through venting now  =)<br>

I will often not donate, but that is only when they are already heading that way or they are a good friend and other reasons. If I ask for a taxi to go out of their way to port me, I am going to make it worth their while.<br>
About two weeks ago I hade just bought some new gear and was down to about 100pp total, including bank and had nothing to sell, I asked for a port from GD to WC, and when the druid took me I gave him 50pp, have of my net worth. He refused so I did a quick /split 100 and disbanded before he could try to split it back to me.<br>
I just wanted you to know that there are players out there that do not shaft taxies unless we have ZERO cash on us.<br>
And also, people, if you have your taxi come get you in a place they would normally not go, and they die. For gods sakes, buy them the resurrection, it is the least you can do.<br>

A donation is just that, a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> donation</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. If you don't establish up front that you expect to be paid a certain amount, don't be upset if you don't get it.  Why not, &quot;Doing ports, 25 plat a seat?&quot;  Oh, I know why, you're hoping for the occasional big spender (people desperate to get somewhere who might give you 100 plat for the ride).<br>

If you travel to them feel free to charge more for the port.<br>
<br>
Two- Stop calling it a donnation and start calling it a fee. We had this discussion on this board recently... If you call it a donnation then paying is optional.<br>
<br>
Three- Get the port fee <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> before</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> porting and make it a standard price for all customers- if they tip you extra then that is up to them.<br>
<br>
Four- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never pay 100p for your res-</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
IMO it would be a good idea for clerics to charge 1pp per % of exp regained from the res. but thats just my 2cp<br>
<br>
p.s. Five- Make a few good cleric friends :-)<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry to hear that you had a bad exp like this- but realizing that there are thousands of people playing EQ, yer bound to run into a few jerks.<br>
<br>
I'm currently a 38th Shaman- I'd be happy to group with you and help you regain your lost exp. Maybe we could both get to 40 this weekend. You could then be much safer in DL... if you are interested pls contact Dunkamar.<br>

Read the former as &quot;porting--donations <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> expected</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;.  I guess some people don't see it that way.<br>
<br>
To put it another way, a donation is 1+, not 0+. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Regardless of how you choose to interpret &quot;porting for donations&quot;, if a druid goes through all that crap to port someone, and that someone just runs off without even a measly few plats in return, or some other token of appreciation, then that scum deserves to be locked in an acoustically interesting room with the Rivervale theme piped in 24/7. <p><HR><IMG SRC="http://www.roguebard.com/images/Chiba/ChibaTenchiSig.gif" HEIGHT=80 WIDTH=180 ALT="Chiba Tenchi, Martial Artiste, Rivervale Defenders, Erollisi Marr"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyrasdjunoesque.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyras DJunoesque</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/21/01 1:12:44 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.jacksonville.net/~madmoose/4a.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick of selfish people!!!!!</span><hr size=1> She said porting for donations.  That implies that the amount of money you choose to give, is up to you.  There is still money expected.  She didnt say 'porting, and if you choose to donate that's fine', she said &quot;porting FOR donations (a variable expected gift to be decided by the donator [money/gems/armor])&quot;<br>

I hate to see selfish bastards try and shaft these nice little druids who go out of their way.  Their playtime is every bit as valuable as the next guys.  They don't log on thinking &quot;boy, I hope I get to zone 70 extra times tonight by doing ports!&quot;<br>
Show some courtesy for the time they are investing, not to mention the after port mana regeneration time. <br>
<br>
Look me up tonight Falek, I'm sure I can find a druidic surprise that will make you feel better. <br>
