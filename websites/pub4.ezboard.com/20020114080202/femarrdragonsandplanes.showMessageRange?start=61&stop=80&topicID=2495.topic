<br>
But anyways ... like I said, MS isn’t going to try to release the sleeper.  IMO it just ruins the zone for future players down the line and that’s just not my style.  I'm very comfortable with letting some guild 9 months from now or whatever, zoning into Sleepers Tomb, fighting to the warders and letting them see the Sleeper laying under his bubble for the first time, and say (just like myself and everyone else has said) &quot;Man he looks bad ass&quot;.  <br>
<br>
IMO Verant dropped the ball on Sleepers Tomb.  If they made a quest that could recapture him that would be something, but they didn't, I keep the game in perspective; in that once he’s released no one will ever see the Sleeper or his Warders again.  Releasing the Sleeper takes a complete zone into a one-dimensional zone.<br>
<br>
Sleepers Tomb is a fun zone and I'm going to leave it just like it is.  That's just me though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As those are probably the weapons that people want the most, if true then it does make a difference, and a big one.<br>

Also if the challenge for you is to kill the 4th warder then do it without killing all the other 3.  You get your challenge and accomplishment, everyone else gets their primal drops.<br>

btw apparently bows, 1hs and blunts do drop from the other mobs, ref. BOTS website.  They also pop in 3 days so it reduces the impact opf the 1-3 primal per warder.<br>

I cannot tell others what to do, but I can ask them to consider killing the 4th warder while leaving the 1st a few times in order to repeat the joy on the kill of the 4th one.  What about all your members that want to kill the 4th that may not be there to do it that time?  If you are determined to release the Sleeper, I think it would be smarter to kill the 1st warder last in any case.  He is a wuss, and you KNOW once the 4th is killed you can drop him.  You are never sure you will win on the 4th warder when you start that fight.<br>
<br>
The main reason I bring that up however, is I don't want to be in the middle of NToV and have the whole guild get trained and wiped out from Kerafym.  Summoning corpses sucks.  I would consider it the height of rudeness to release the Sleeper without some advance warning to the rest of the server, especially those in zones the Sleeper rampages through.  (A wipeout in Veeshans Peak would not be pretty either, depending on the timing, position, etc.)  Thus killing the First warder after the Fourth to release the Sleeper would give folks a chance to get out of Kerafym's way.  It will just take one tell to a guild member in one of the rampage zones.  Please think about that.  One courtesy tell could prevent hours of corpse summoning, rebreaking, etc.<br>
<br>
Stupid of Verant to script a MOB to kill PC's in other zones.  Why not script him to kill NPC only and vanish?  Under this design, it actually *IS* possible for someone (See: Boogeyman thread) to train people in a different zone after all.  Does Bubu have a ST key yet?.... <p>Wyvern Wyrmsong <br>

<br>
Even if the current ST capable guilds agree to always leave a warder up, that would just mean that releasing the Sleeper was as easy as killing that one warder each and every time one of the ST guilds was finished.<br>
<br>
Eventually, a guild that doesnt read these stupid boards will have enough keys to start doing easy warders and will wake the Sleeper without even realizing it.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I would rather see our server wake the Sleeper clean (a guild clears the zone), than have it happen accidentally because we were all trying so hard to preserve the zone for tourists.  Personally, I *like* the idea of dynamic content and even if I wasnt personally involved with effecting the change, it would be cool to see the world evolve. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udinuvenstratocaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dinuven Stratocaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 290<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/8/01 2:42:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleepers Tomb and the 4th Warder</span><hr size=1> I find it amusing that I'm the only bard who doesn't give a shit about dumb illusion masks. <p><font size="3"><b>"My songs will split your soul" - Virtuoso of Erollisi Marr</b></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulaodorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laodorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 231<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/9/01 12:19:13 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleepers Tomb and the 4th Warder</span><hr size=1> <br>
I think its kinda silly to get all worried about releasing the sleeper.  The weapons that are &quot;needed&quot; from the zone still drop, there are quest rewards (in WW) that are somewhat better then havin a key rot in your bank.  Chances are high that once the golems start droppin more primal a guild will get more then enough much faster then when the warders are up (how many times do warders drop 3 gloves/staves and 2 stones).<br>
<br>
IMO the final arbiter presents slightly more of a challenge (especially if wielding) then the first 2 warders, and the third is doable with 20-22ish.<br>
<br>
I think what people react to is the fear that ST will basically break, and that they will never get their toys from the zone.  Which is a valid concern... if that were the case.  I hate to break it to the masses but the mobs that you kill to get your ST keys are harder then the first 3 warders.  And lets not kid ourselves,  once you have seen 1 dragon... they pretty much all look the same.<br>
<br>
So if Magister manages to free the Sleeper ...  Kudos to them.  If we (for some odd reason) succeed in it...  then oh well /shrug.  I think that no one would be complaining when they turn in their scale/key for a mace that owns any weapons outside of NToV.  Or when they clear the golems twice a week and get their guild outfitted in primal weeks faster then the guilds that were killing warders.<br>
<br>
Personally I like the idea of having &quot;dynamic&quot; content.  I think it would be great if there were more &quot;one time kill&quot; mobs... but the way that EQ is built that can't really happen. <p><i>

<br>
Yes, seeing the Sleeper under his bubble for the first time is pretty neat. And I am glad that I am one of the people who has seen that but I am also realistic enough to know that sooner or later on E.Marr as on other servers it is going to get woken here too. It affects nothing other than removing 5 graphic mobs from a zone and a couple of items ( SoD, Gnome Mask, Resistance Stones and the few odds and ends the warders drop ) , all the primal ( which is the real reason people go to ST ) still drops although perhaps a bit more sporadically. If anything it makes getting primal easier as you can kill golems with less people than Warders and they respawn faster. <br>
<br>
I agree with Laodorf that more one time content or quests that actually changed the game world would be a good thing. We've all complained that the world is too static, now for the first time a quest arrives that does actually change the world and people are up in arms. So what they really want is non-static content that only "they" get to experience. <br>
<br>
Heh imagine if Vulak or Tormax were one time only encounters... :) Or if a failed Ringwar lead to the giants permanently camping in Thurg and the dwarven resistance moving to Frosthome ( or whatver their town is in Crystal Caverns ). Then a massive quest that caused an invasion of Thurg with a dwarven army  to force the giants out. Shrug, the more dynamic stuff there is the better. People just need to resign themselves to the fact that "they" won't nessescarily get to experience it directly themselves. That's probably a more bitter pill for those of us in uber guilds to swallow since we tend to assume that we will kill everything and get everything so the chance that Magister or MS or SF might beat the others to something and get Shiny_Toy_124135 scares us.. but then ultimately that's the way these games have to go to continue the replayability. <br>

I unfortunately don't have much to add other then 2 points.  Primal will still drop and the Sleeper WILL be released.  <br>
<br>
Since he will eventually be released whether it be tomorrow or 3 years from now its gonna happen.  What does this imply?  Well the people who could have released him first did not so they miss the &quot;show&quot;.  If he is released the people who have not been miss the &quot;graphics&quot; of the 4 warders and the Sleeper.  So any way you look at it some group is gonna lose if you must think of it as loseing.<br>
<br>
Now personally I would never be a part of removeing primal from the game.  But this is not the case so what I have to decide as an individual in Magister is do I feel like I want to see the Sleeper awaken by my guild or read about it 2 years from now being awaken by new guild XYZ?  <br>
<br>
Last question is this.  Which is more selfish?  Us or MSF releasing the Sleeper because we were able to first on our server or is it more selfish to ask us or MSF not to so some day YOU may get in the zone with a strong enough force to try?  To me only thing lost is a toy mask and 5 graphics of dragons.  You want dragons worth looking at and destroying?  Try ToV North.  Other wise take the primal where it falls and forget about 5 stupid graphics.  If it happens it happens.  Nothing gained except a show for a few lucky enough to witness and certainly nothing lost.<br>
<br>
Just my thought.<br>

Thus can you get new keys to ST after that?<br>
<br>
If you can, then again you can turn your key too with the shining scale or whatever to get those juicy loots after-release rewards, which is pretty good reward, if it stands that every kill of keydragon rewards some lucky person the heart and thus a key.<br>
<br>
If you can't get more keys, then the Primals aren't actually dropping for new people anymore.<br>
<br>
Either way I would like to see the zone, but then again, given a chance I probably wouldn't turn down the invitation if someone dropped me a tell &quot;Hey buttplug, want to join us slaying all wardens and releasing the sleeper?&quot;.<br>
<br>
So I understand the motives and give thumbs up myself to all who try to get sleeper awaken. Because eventually it will happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, I want the gnome mask as well dammit!<br>
