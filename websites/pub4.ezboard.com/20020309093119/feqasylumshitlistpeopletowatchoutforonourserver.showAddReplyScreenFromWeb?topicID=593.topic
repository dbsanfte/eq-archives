(7/5/01 2:07:30 am)<br>
<br>
hiya,<br>
I tried to forget this incident because it tramatized me <br>
Anyway, I'm going to tell my side of what happened that night. My group, me(micromini), Kandom, Lebesgue(sp), Gnarlimon and Aldrich are hanging out at the 3-spawn by the rock after the entrence hall killing frogs and waiting on another member. Kandom, who is imo a good monk and prob not Kandon, pulled a kor shaman. He announced jokingly that this would be his cloak. Heh, the coincidence was startling <br>
<br>
Anywho, seeing the cloak in the loot window drove directly into a state of excitement from which I immediatly demanded that melee roll right away. that was me and kandom. I rolled 78 and he an 80. At the time I was so worked up about winning the cloak that I didn't think about Kandom having his epic as well as a rbg(higher haste then sbc, kandom even said it was). If i had been thinking strait I might have been able to make some kind of claim to it and kept it. I coughed up the cloak on the spot( I acctually had it in trade window while we were rolling) and immediatly started sending 80 quadrillion tells to my friends about the incident. <br>
<br>
I mostly expected people to be surprised that it dropped but for the most part I got the impression from them that I got strait jacked. In fact one of them used those exact words. Gnarlimon and Lebesgue sent me tells saying that I would have gotten more use out of it. Gnarlimon in particular commented that since he would not be getting more haste off the item all he would be getting was stats, and if that were the case then the casters would have as much right to roll on it then as he did. A few people i told also sent tell to kandom about it, not sure what all was said. At one point kandom got annoyed at me and told me to get my friends of his back. He accused me of sending them after him and that i was a coward or something like that, forgot exactly what he said that was the gist of it though.<br>
<br>
The night was pretty unpleasant and i kind of wish the cloak hadn't dropped. I heard about this CoF thing earlier today. Does anyone know for sure If he won it or if he bought it? If he used the sbc to get it then I do think he should be on here. Otherwise, i dont know, I needed the cloak for haste and he didn't. But if i had thought more clearly when it dropped that probably wouldn't have been a problem. dammit now im all bitter and stuff, thx SL!<br>
<br>

sbc 26% haste<br>
rbg 31% haste<br>

(then 2 other people also post that he def. had the item he claimed NBG on once before at another raid but sold it. So this was 2nd time he had gotten the items on NBG)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well, before i heard about all of this i thought kandom was a good guy, but now, he is not in my book, he trains people? and kills them when they are in the same group as him in seb? lol lame. anyhow i was in ec with steelfists, i was watching maxxim with a tantors tusk, own steelfists! for 250 a hit(lol!)then i inspected kandom, he was standing right there, he had a CoF on, and immediatly after i inspected he showed me a SBC in trade window, but he wasn't wearing his fungi/RBG im guessing he sold those to buy CoF. hmmm he prolly won fungi/RBG in &quot;NEED&quot; groups before, and he had the cloak, yes the SBC he doesn't need 2..so he prolly is gonna sell it so he can buy back fungi/RBG and then he could say he already had a CoF so he didnt NEED the SBC anymore, then people wouldn't be on his back about selling the SBC...he has it all planned i guess, dunno wtf is going on but it doesn't smell good.<br>

LOL.....I see kandom may have finally learned how to pull, but still sux hard in the &quot;being a decent person&quot; department. I remeber hinm in Solb, he used to train Named room all the time. He was a piece of work. KSed all the damn time. Stole pulls from many a camp. I believe he got through 5 lvls he told me just taken pulls from otheres, that right K man? All this and he found a guild proud to have him. He found others willing to help him raid so he could get these great items. He has his epic for cryin out loud. So i figure, someone out there likes him. But the real problem is if you ddon't aggree with hisplaying, don't SL him, not worthit. Just stop including him in groups and do the same to othes in his guild. They will get the point sooner or later. If they are willing to have him in guild then they should be willing to deal with the reprocussions of his actions as a whole. /shrug<br>
Otherwise, stop inviting him in groups if you like honest poeple. I don't think that Kandom has really hidden the fact that he's a greedy shit. So if yoiu didn't know, sorry. And i am sad Micro me lil man that this happened to you, but I'm glad you got over it like an honorable guy like you would. You will get another, i'm sure man <br>
<br>
As for the Kman, leave him alone, as he continues to wrong people even his friends (who are brainwashed enough to defend him when he is obviously wrong) will stop helping him out. Or, you can go with Sly's method. Byut don't SL him, just let your friends know he's a waste of skin, so they know not to group with him. Its that easy<br>
<br>
And unlike the chicken shit who started this post i will put down my name. hell, that anon shit bugs me more than what kandom did.<br>

&lt;votes for hating Kandom/Kandon&gt; Does _anyone_ else remember Kandom/Kandon being on the SL previously? So far I havn't taken the 2-3 hours it would to read through the Orcalan/Laaw threads.. I think that's where he'd be.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as for calling Kandom a *terrible* monk, we were in a SolB group, and he continually trained the group. He couldn't figure out that mobs above level 32 often remember you when you FD! &lt;gasp&gt;<br>
<br>
If I recall correctly, Kandon/Kandon enjoys training anyone who &quot;gets in his way&quot; and it's OK because &quot;we can't really stop him&quot;.. might makes right, hmm?<br>
<br>
And, yeah, Kandom, if you *did* steal from the NbG group, then you are a thief. <br>

kandom first of imo is the shitiest monk on the server.<br>
he is greedy and yes i know he had a cof before this because i check out most every monk i come across gear and seen cof on him. so if he was allowed roll everyone in group should have since they all had same to gain from it. <br>

some stuff you could shitlist him for is purposlly attacking tunare to screw up pog and then saying he didn't when he sent me a tell saying he did. <br>

I unfortunately witnessed the original poster's story. While fighting on the way to the kitchen, the ML looted a sib cloak. I inspected the two melees in the group, as xp groups in seb are almost always nbg. Kandom was using RBG+epic, and Micromini was using a CoS/TBB. Kandom clearly does not NEED a sib cloak, unless he argues that would free up his waist slot for something uber. However, he did not make that argument and rolled with the intention of selling the item, a SLable offense (or it should be). <br>
<br>
I'm never rezzing Kandom's greedy corpse, I will never consider joining a guild that lists him as a member, and I deeply regret helping this greedy sleeze with Xenovorash.<br>
<br>
And Kandom is wearing a CoF right now.<br>

Hmm i remember Kandom back as Kandon&lt;think that was it the pally&gt; in CoM back when we were all lvl 40 or so i think heh, Bunny was leading a raid in there&lt;erinal the old leader of TSO&gt;. She was pulling and had 2 groups set up pulling one to each. I came late and kandon came with and kept bothering ol erinal and not listing to pull rules and such just wanting &quot;more kills to get loot&quot;, finally good ol erinal got pissed and left lol&lt;those who remember erinal know she was pretty calm and lvl headed &gt; So what did kandon do....apologize? naa he kept shouting telling people he would pull and needed people to stay so they could get some loot heh. That was the day i joined TSO and i remember it pretty clear heh. This has no point and im not SLing kandon for it or anything but does kinda paint a picture of what our beloved kandom has become . I wasnt there so i cant say much about this issue but a few peeps i trust to be very honorable peeps told me their accounts and from what they said kandom i really lost respect for you, a guy without even a haste item....you with a.....whatever man, thats pretty shady man. Oh well thus is life, and we will all move on, just hope that IF you are given a chance by alot of these peeps you will make the best of it, cuz all the uberness in the world dont help if ya gotta solo to 60 <br>

Someone who has a CoF, and claims need on a Sib Cloak, is, well in my opinion, a jerk. That in itself shit listable? Probably not. You could probably tap dance around need, claiming you need the STR off the cloak or some garbage like that.<br>
<br>
Okay, so he needed it, he rolled it, and won. No big deal, right? I would end it right there, but oh no, now he turns around willing to sell it. That makes him a lying bitch who abused the groups good will by letting only Micromini and him roll. If it was a cash item to sell oce you left, then he just screwed the rest of the group out of what, 80k+?<br>
<br>
Uh uh, that's pure bull shit. If he wants to group, and claim nb4g on something, he better damn well mean it. He lied to the group, took advantage of them, and spit in their faces. If that doesn't deserve a nice little nook on the shit list, then ... well, all I can say is that is BS. <p><center>

<br>
...Morales people,Shit I want a WillSapper and Cobalt bracer but I don't go around claiming NBG on high end items others could actually use so I can twink them or sell them at high prices to buy items I want..<br>
<br>
I've heard lots of stories about Kandom but I don't recite things I'm not 100% positive on,or spread inaccurate stories or rumors..Personally aside from his lust for loot I think he is a fairly skilled monk..Not to bad of a guy,but he is certainly not Jesus either.<br>
<br>
Dreamingwolf:NBG applies to an item that if drops will directly of use on the primary character.If the person isn't willing to put that item in the slot it goes in for a good long while then they should not claim NBG on it.When claiming NBG I also consider others in the group position.A belt of the great turtle is good for it's proc to me,but for people with back-slot haste items it is godly waist item..Plenty of more examples I could list.<br>
<br>
Baeras:If only Kandom and Micromini rolled then they were the only people who &quot;CLAIMED&quot; NBG,but personally you do not -need- a sbc with a rbg,and Kandom selling loot the next day isn't exactly the best way to cover up tracks ;-P<br>
<br>
-Apology for the comment about selling the cloak,Didn't know he won it before he gained a CoF.<br>

CoF is better than SBC, are you gonna tell me that selling a NBG loot for a better item of the exact kind is wrong? Well, it isn't.  Also, he rolled against micro, and micro lost. Just because someone needs an item more than someone else, doesn't default it to them.  Need is need.  Getting into &quot;who needs an item more&quot; and basing loot on that is asking for trouble.  Also, Kandom DID NOT sell a fungi so he could get another, he won a 2nd in a GREED group at shrooms, which is perfectly fine.  So please, get your facts straight before you post crap like this trying to ruin a person's reputation.  Thanks<br>

That's abusing the nb4g system, genius. Everyone could have rolled on it to get better equipment, though due to nb4g, only the melee's were allowed to roll. If what you say here is true, then I would think this alone would be enough warrants a shit list posting. If he was selling it to get better equipment, he just jacked everyone who didn't roll out of 80k+ worth of better equipment, under the understanding that he would not sell it and use it. <p><center>

I tried to forget this incident because it tramatized me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm going to tell my side of what happened that night. My group, me(micromini), Kandom, Lebesgue(sp), Gnarlimon and Aldrich are hanging out at the 3-spawn by the rock after the entrence hall killing frogs and waiting on another member. Kandom, who is imo a good monk and prob not Kandon, pulled a kor shaman. He announced jokingly that this would be his cloak. Heh, the coincidence was startling <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anywho, seeing the cloak in the loot window drove directly into a state of excitement from which I immediatly demanded that melee roll right away. that was me and kandom. I rolled 78 and he an 80. At the time I was so worked up about winning the cloak that I didn't think about Kandom having his epic as well as a rbg(higher haste then sbc, kandom even said it was). If i had been thinking strait I might have been able to make some kind of claim to it and kept it. I coughed up the cloak on the spot( I acctually had it in trade window while we were rolling) and immediatly started sending 80 quadrillion tells to my friends about the incident. <br>
<br>
I mostly expected people to be surprised that it dropped but for the most part I got the impression from them that I got strait jacked. In fact one of them used those exact words. Gnarlimon and Lebesgue sent me tells saying that I would have gotten more use out of it. Gnarlimon in particular commented that since he would not be getting more haste off the item all he would be getting was stats, and if that were the case then the casters would have as much right to roll on it then as he did. A few people i told also sent tell to kandom about it, not sure what all was said. At one point kandom got annoyed at me and told me to get my friends of his back. He accused me of sending them after him and that i was a coward or something like that, forgot exactly what he said that was the gist of it though.<br>
<br>
The night was pretty unpleasant and i kind of wish the cloak hadn't dropped. I heard about this CoF thing earlier today. Does anyone know for sure If he won it or if he bought it? If he used the sbc to get it then I do think he should be on here. Otherwise, i dont know, I needed the cloak for haste and he didn't. But if i had thought more clearly when it dropped that probably wouldn't have been a problem. dammit now im all bitter and stuff, thx SL!<br>

I know if someone offered me a good enough price for a piece of my armor I would for sure sell and buy something else/better........anyone ever think he NEEDED cloak at time (which I think he did) and had his eye on a CoF and was planning to buy it, and heck selling the other one would give him the $$ to buy the Cof....Im sure we've ALLL done this....used an item for a short time and sold it to pay for the item of your dreams...I have I know this!<br>
This isnt s-list worthy and people who whine, snivel over things like this are just being pains in the arse....you giving Kandom a bad name over something you shouldnt...try talking to the person next time instead of running to your mommy (the s-list) and whining about something that could very well be not true and that will hurt someones rep.<br>
