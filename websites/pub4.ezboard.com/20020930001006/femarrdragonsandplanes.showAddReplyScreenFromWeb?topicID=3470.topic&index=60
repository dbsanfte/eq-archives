Nice statistic about the unemployement. It doesnt include people who benefits have run out, or people that have simply given up. So SURE they can play with the <br>
numbers they have and ignore the rest. The statistic show a movement of hispanic<br>
workers back to Mexico at the moment. I wonder what that means?<br>
<br>
Bush went into Somalia, not Clinton. Clinton tried VERY hard to bury the Bosnia<br>
issue and simply ignore it. Pictures of dead people and lots of shall we say<br>
active journalism forced him to react. At least he didnt bomb the Canadians.<br>
<br>
So where else do you think Clinton commited troops during his admin? I am mildly<br>
curious.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the confusion is the word 'tanked', a drop of 7% in one day is 'tanking'<br>
in my book. However it rallied. This time.<br>
<br>
Merentha Social Security exists. The party that tries to lean on it will lose every election they have. It doesnt matter if you like it or not. It doesnt matter how you think it was created. It is there. DEAL WITH IT. Shrub is in office. His ball.<br>
<br>
But Flubman, unlike the tripe you just posted actually made some valid points.<br>
Dont try and tell me that the Democrats are outdoing Rebublicans at the ONE feature that is a hallmark of the Republicans since the party was invented,<br>
being in bed with Big business. I dont know how to lable your assertion,<br>
words are too weak.<br>
<br>
If you think that the United States is now competative in the world, Take a look at the price of steel. Its cheaper at the moment to buy steel from Japan and ship it<br>
to Detroit, than it is to rail it there from the east coast. Why is that?<br>
Could it be that the Steel industry still refuses to convert to more efficient<br>
converters? Could it be the railroads like to price gouge? Beats me, Im a computer tech, not an economist. But I can tell you all the chips I see are made somewhere<br>
other than the USA. Yeah we are real competative, and all thanx to Reagan.<br>

Your statement implies that those 12 years were 12 years of not only republican control but 12 years of bad economic times which is a lie. And why does someone always have to be to blame? Economies go in cycles. We had 2 1/2 to 3 bad years during Reagans 8 in office depending on the yardstick you use.<br>

 nice try at making a point. You gave yourself away earlier in this thread. While others give heartfelt posts or offer proof, you, by your own admission, use debating tactics to &quot;win points&quot;. You use loaded words like &quot;PLAY with the numbers&quot;.  The numbers say what they say. People like you who only engage in debating tactics might twist them for their own games but the numbers are there none the less.<br>

Just once on these boards will you cite your sources!?  Stop presenting things off topic to win your damned brownie points. Show me where to find this magic statistic you conjure up out of the same ozone you think Clinton used to make things sweet and happy and gay overnight or that Bush used by making one statement to poison our air and water and markets with one mere sentence. Or show me the relevance of your comment about Mexico to what we were talking about.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Bush went into Somalia, not Clinton. Clinton tried VERY hard to bury the Bosnia issue and simply ignore it. Pictures of dead people and lots of shall we say<br>

<br>
Who said anything about Somalia?  Where do you get this stuff? I certainly never mentioned Somalia. And just to match you nonsensical non sequitor for nonsensical nonsequitor . . . Bush never bombed the Chinese embassy either like our military under Clinton  . . . or a deserted pharmaceutical plant.When Bosnia was a convenient diversion from impeachment, Clinton attacked. Hardly doing ones best to bury the Bosnia issue. And hardly putting the good of the country ahead of his own personal good, but then Clinotn never did know much about that.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps the confusion is the word 'tanked', a drop of 7% in one day is 'tanking'<br>

<br>
then define your terms. The market is down over 18 months but you meant what it did in one day . . . and not even waiting til the end of the day . . . If you are going to use nonstandard definitions as working definitions to try and weasel out of what you said . . . define your terms ahead of the facts proving you wrong please<br>

<br>
lol  again you try to define the issue. You think that only YOU are allowed to define the issues. When you cant defend what you say you take your ball and go home. Of course Social Security is here and the country is worse off for it. Only the Democratic Party gains by it. And yet AGAIN you play your word games. Instead of going back and doing your homework, you throw ou tthe perjorative phrase &quot; how I THINK it was created&quot;. You ignore what you cant disprove. I am not saying everyone has to be as complete as Glori is in backing up what she says but you NEVER back up anything you say.<br>
<br>
No wonder people here hate you. You arent trying to prove anything. You arent trying to educate anyone. You arent backing your own heartfelt opinions. You are here to masturbate. You are here to attack. You are here to feed your own ego.  While I wish I had the patience, thouroughness and time Glori has to cite reference after reference, I do at least cite sources. You on the other hand, BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION merely engage in debate tactics. I find you despicable and pathetic for it. Please dont call me out to get your jollies any more. I come here for the first time in two weeks to find I am called out by some pathetic old man with nothing to give him joy but making debate points with no facts to support him. By your posts it seems you are FOR nothing and AGAINST everything. You are against capitalism but have no better alternative to suggest. You are AGAINST Republicans but are quick to cut off attack by saying that doesnt mean you are FOR Dems. How mean spirited must someone be to be AGAINST everything? How sad must one be to mentally masurbate online trying to win debate points with people who actually believe in something? I am not above engaging in pissing contests but you offer nothing to this board EXCEPT pissing contests.<br>
<br>
Get a Goldfish . . . Please!<br>

You dodged the question. So your what claiming I am lying? Actually I am quoting<br>
a female economist from Foxnews. I cant recall her name so I didnt attribute.<br>
In any case you sited NO statistics in the original point. So why do I need to?<br>

dying in Bosnia. Surley you recall Pat Buchanon making cheap capital touring the country with pictures of the results of the death squads. It was Italy screaming<br>
at Clinton as a member on Nato that finnaly forced Clinton to act. He was wise enough to know it was a lose-lose issue.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
You mean like Clinton who invaded Bosnia to take the heat off his own probs at home? Who sent troops off on more wild goose chases than any other president? More engagements than any other president? <br>
**************************************************************<br>
Far be it from me to accuse anyone of making up things to foster a point,<br>
But I would like to know what the phrase 'Who sent troops off on more wild goose chases than any other president? ' means if it doesnt mean troop commitment to an activity. If that IS what it means, I am asking you to name a few. It would<br>
be very hard to beat Teddy Roosevelt if your talking about adventurism.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps the confusion is the word 'tanked', a drop of 7% in one day is 'tanking'<br>
in my book. However it rallied. This time.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
then define your terms. The market is down over 18 months but you meant what it did in one day . . . and not even waiting til the end of the day . . . If you are going to use nonstandard definitions as working definitions to try and weasel out of what you said . . . define your terms ahead of the facts proving you wrong please<br>
**************************************************************<br>
The original statement was rhetorical and designed to provoke. I didnt consider it<br>
necessary. I did consider it obvious.<br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;Merentha Social Security exists. The party that tries to lean on it will lose every election they have. It doesnt matter if you like it or not. It doesnt matter how you think it was created. It is there. DEAL WITH IT. Shrub is in office. His ball.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
lol again you try to define the issue. You think that only YOU are allowed to define the issues. When you cant defend what you say you take your ball and go home. Of course Social Security is here and the country is worse off for it. Only the Democratic Party gains by it. And yet AGAIN you play your word games. Instead of going back and doing your homework, you throw ou tthe perjorative phrase &quot; how I THINK it was created&quot;. You ignore what you cant disprove. I am not saying everyone has to be as complete as Glori is in backing up what she says but you NEVER back up anything you say.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
Actually Merentha at times I do. I have found that it NEVER matters on this board.<br>
People here only wish reinforcement of percieved predjudice. They are uninterested<br>
in what your calling 'facts' (I would call it evidence - its a debate thing)<br>
All commentators cater to their audience. Also you didnt say anything about the validity of the original comment. That implies by default you must agree.<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
No wonder people here hate you. You arent trying to prove anything. You arent trying to educate anyone. You arent backing your own heartfelt opinions. You are here to masturbate. You are here to attack. You are here to feed your own ego. While I wish I had the patience, thouroughness and time Glori has to cite reference after reference, I do at least cite sources. You on the other hand, BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION merely engage in debate tactics. I find you despicable and pathetic for it. Please dont call me out to get your jollies any more. I come here for the first time in two weeks to find I am called out by some pathetic old man with nothing to give him joy but making debate points with no facts to support him. By your posts it seems you are FOR nothing and AGAINST everything. You are against capitalism but have no better alternative to suggest. You are AGAINST Republicans but are quick to cut off attack by saying that doesnt mean you are FOR Dems. How mean spirited must someone be to be AGAINST everything? How sad must one be to mentally masurbate online trying to win debate points with people who actually believe in something? I am not above engaging in pissing contests but you offer nothing to this board EXCEPT pissing contests.<br>
*************************************************************<br>
Well Merentha I can make a point without personal attacks, and without vulgarity.<br>
Sadly that doesnt seem to be the case with you. As for what I do on the board and<br>
what I will do on the board, that isnt controlled by you. You can demand anything you want. But unless I agree with your reasoning, it is unlikely I will comply.<br>
I have stated I hate Republicans yes - using your words that means 'I am against them' but you scream that I dont say I am for Democrats. Why would I be?<br>
When I was a teenager who was in Office again? LBJ. We really thought his policy<br>
on South-east asia was well thought out and defensible let me tell you.<br>
As classmates got drafted and came back not living boy, we loved the Prez.<br>
You are now defining everything I do as a 'debate tactic' you do an emmense<br>
disservice to the National Forensic Society. Not everything I say or do is a debate<br>
tactic. My cheapest shots are simple imitation of people like Robert Novak.<br>
(an attack dog if there ever was one)<br>
So tell me would offering you 'evidence' cause you to conceed a point or would it simply open the doors to endless refutation with counter-evidence? THAT is a serious question. I am not interested in endless straight refutation. Its boring<br>
and useless. You yourself offered little or no evidence in your rebuttal. Does this<br>
not bring you down to my alleged level?<br>
<br>
No Merentha I found your original post (what a month back?) well written<br>
and above the rest. I thought we could play around with this topic. Sadly<br>
I see you only wish to adopt name calling. It would have been simpler to say you dont want to play. The fallicies that are being promoted in this thread are dangerous. They are political expedience. They are un-truths which do deserve<br>
comments. When I see them I will comment.<br>
<br>
One last thing. Do not confuse Inter-game issues with RL issues.<br>
I am ammeniable to suggestion on the RL topics. I am not on intergame issues.<br>
I know why I am hated and it has very little to do with political commentary<br>
and it has ALOT to do with stepping on sacred cows. If you dont know that,<br>
then you know it now. I may or may not consider providing evidence for a RL<br>
issue. I will not for an intergame issue unless by doing so I can seriously compromise an opponent. The readers of this forum are polarized in the largest<br>
sence. They have no true interest in evidence. Some disrespect evidence so<br>
much that they fabricate it at will. If you choose to feel I am lying, by all means do so.<br>

<br>
If you are trying to imply that Vendrix and the like are sacred, you are sadly mistaken, I in no way idolize or elevate any player to that status, did it ever occur to you that we are all on the same side because, with the evidence that has been presented, we all think your crusade is unjust and a hypocritical idiosyncrasy? We are, well I am not, jumping on the 'holy Da`Kor bandwagon' that you seam to think exists, I saw some of what happened, I read a lot about some of the other stuff that happened, and I made my opinions based on that, I did NOT merely see that Da`Kor was on one side of the table with you on the other and just go with them.<br>
<br>
And it is not only your in game actions and persona that have condemned you, the way you portray yourself here on these boards day after day just confirms our opinions of you, you are very predictable and until you present some argument that holds an ounce of water we will, at least I will, continue to shun your opinions and mock your allegations.<br>
<br>
We are not against being shown evidence, but most of the time you can't present any.<br>
<br>
On issues like the training of Ewle, if I was a monk at that time and in the same situation, I would have trained her ass back to lvl 6 as well, and I am one of the nicer people you will meet in game. I don't fuc<!>k people over, I don't train for the hell of it, I always apologize if I fuc<!>k up, I try to make the best of all situations, and I have a damn good time doing it, but I would have trained the flying fuc<!>k out of her malicious ass because it was the right thing to do. <br>

I dont really care why YOU Igota like or dislike me. The crusade started on that<br>
ingame issue. I had never posted on any board prior to that. I wasnt interested<br>
you see. I 'just wanted to play'<br>
<br>
If you think that training Ewle was justified then you should feel Mitch training<br>
whoever was justified. That is my sole point, on that issue. If you dont feel<br>
that way, then I suggest YOU are a hypocrite. <br>
<br>
You see you will find no post anywhere where I have ever said training Ewle<br>
was unjustified. Please feel free to try. My beef as I stated was with the actions<br>
of the GM. No one has bothered to ever ask what I think on a 'MORAL' level of the action. But you keep dreaming.<br>

That isnt exactly Hyberbole either. I went to Dusseldorf to attempt to trace the familiy. The search was less than productive.<br>
