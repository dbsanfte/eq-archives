 <br>
      Sept. 12 —   The passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 out of Newark, N.J., knew they were going to die. Already at least one passenger had been killed by the knife-wielding terrorists who had hijacked the plane. But some decided they were going to go down fighting — a decision that may have resulted in the plane crashing in rural western Pennsylvania, perhaps saving a national landmark and untold lives on the ground.    <br>
<br>
THE FLIGHT DEPARTED for San Francisco at 8:01 a.m. ET with 38 passengers, two pilots and five flight attendants. It is not known exactly when or how the terrorists seized control of the airplane, or how many terrorists there were.<br>
       On at least one other plane hijacked in Tuesday’s coordinated attack on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, terrorists used knives made of razors embedded in plastic handles to kill flight attendants, then lured the pilots out of the cockpit to seize control, according to a report by the Boston Herald.<br>
       On that flight, the terrorists had brought the makeshift knives on board in their shaving bags and other carry-ons. Wielding those weapons, the terrorists pulled stewardesses to the back of one of the planes that departed Boston’s Logan Airport and began killing them. But the stewardesses were not their real target — they used the murders to lure the pilots out of the cockpit so they could seize control of the jet.<br>
       “They started killing stewardesses in the back of the plane as a diversion. The pilot came back to help, and that is how they got into the cockpit,” an anonymous source told The Herald. The source could not specify whether those events took place on the American Airlines flight that left Boston’s Logan airport, or the United Airlines flight. Both planes flew into the World Trade Center roughly an hour after they departed Boston.   <br>
<br>
U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft said the hijackers used knives to subdue the crew of American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to strike the World Trade Center. He said there were three to six hijackers on each plane.<br>
       On United Flight 93, at least one flight attendant called home to say goodbye.<br>
       CeeCee Lyles called her husband at home in Fort Myers, Fla., on her cell phone. There were screams in the background. She sobbed as she told him she loved him and their children.<br>
       <br>
‘WE’VE BEEN HIJACKED’<br>
       “She called him and let him know how much she loved him and the boys,” her aunt, Mareya Schneider, said. <br>
       “We’ve been hijacked,” Lyles told her husband. Then, the phone went dead.   <br>
 <br>
       Alice Hoglan told KTVU-TV in San Francisco that her son, Mark Bingham, 31, called her from aboard the flight at 9:44 EST.<br>
       “We’ve been taken over. There are three men that say they have a bomb,” Hoglan quoted her son as saying.<br>
       It was not known for certain where the terrorists wanted to take the plane. Some news reports have speculated that the plane may have been heading for Camp David, Md., the presidential retreat.<br>
       <br>
A FIGHT TO THE END<br>
       From the back of the plane, Thomas Burnett, a businessman from San Ramon, Calif., called his wife, Deena. The flight was doomed he said. They were going to die. One passenger had already been stabbed to death. Burnett couldn’t just sit and let it happen.<br>
       “I know we’re all going to die — there’s three of us who are going to do something about it,” the family’s priest quoted Burnett as saying.<br>
       The Rev. Frank Colacicco told the San Francisco Chronicle that Burnett then told his wife, “I love you, honey.”<br>
       According to the Washington Post, Jeremy Glick, 31, placed a similar call to his wife, Lyzbeth. Glick told her that the terrorists — three men wearing red headbands and carrying a red box they said contained a bomb — had forced the crew into the back of the plane and taken over the cockpit, his brother-in-law Douglas B. Hurwitt told the paper. <br>
       After several minutes of explaining what was happening, Glick said he and several other passengers were going to try to do something.<br>
       “He knew that stopping them was going to end all of their lives. But that was my brother-in-law. He was a take-charge guy,” Hurwitt told the Post.<br>
       Glick told his wife that he knew he was going to die, and that she should have a good life and take care of their 3-month-old child.<br>
       Did Burnett, Glick and other passengers know what had happened at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon? Had something said in the cockpit spurred the decision to fight back? Did they know where the plane was headed?<br>
       Details of what the passengers did next are not known, nor is it known whether their actions were successful.<br>
       At 10 a.m., the plane suddenly went down, crashing into rural western Pennsylvania, where it created a crater 30 feet across and 20 feet deep, and scattered debris for half a mile.<br>
       Whatever target was intended for destruction was spared, and with it untold lives.<br>
       <br>
‘WE HAVE OTHER PLANES’<br>
       On other flights, passengers made phone calls saying the hijackers had subdued their crews with knives and other sharp instruments.<br>
       Air-traffic controllers actually heard hijackers instructing the pilots in English from inside the cockpit of American Airlines Flight 11, the Christian Science Monitor reported, quoting a flight controller in Nashua, N.H., handling the flight.<br>
       “One of the pilots keyed their mike so the conversation between the pilot and the person in the cockpit could be heard,” an unidentified controller told the Christian Science Monitor. “The person in the cockpit was speaking English. He was saying something like, ‘Don’t do anything foolish. You’re not going to get hurt.”’<br>
       The controller also heard someone in the cockpit telling the pilot, “We have more planes, we have other planes.”<br>
       That flight, originating in Boston and bound for Los Angeles, carried 92 passengers.<br>
       All four hijacked planes were headed to California on Tuesday morning. Two crashed into the World Trade Center in New York, one into the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., and one in Pennsylvania. The four planes carried 266 people. <br>
       <br>
‘CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS’<br>
       On board the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, former federal prosecutor and conservative political commentator Barbara Olson called her husband, U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, on a cell phone twice. She said the plane had been hijacked by attackers using knives and sharp instruments. She also said armed hijackers had forced passengers to the rear of the jet.<br>
       “Can you believe this ... we are being hijacked,” a friend quoted her as saying. Then, the phone went dead. American Airlines Flight 77, bound from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles with 64 passengers and crew, flew low to the ground and then crashed into the Pentagon going 600 mph and loaded with 30,000 pounds of fuel.<br>
       In another report from a Connecticut TV station, one passenger aboard the second plane that hit the World Trade Center was able to use a phone on the aircraft to report that terrorists had taken over the plane and stabbed one of the flight attendants. United Airlines Flight 175 was bound from Boston to Los Angeles with 65 people on board. <br>
       News12 in Easton, Conn., said a resident there received the phone call from the passenger. The report could not be independently confirmed.<br>
