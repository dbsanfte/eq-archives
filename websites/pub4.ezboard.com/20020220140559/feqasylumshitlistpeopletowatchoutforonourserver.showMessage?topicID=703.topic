Called a camp check and named and BnB were camped so we decides to take Window room.  Being that I am 53 I don't get great exp in there since 50% of them are green and the rest are that light blue color.  My druid friend was only 41 one yellow from 42 so I wanted to help her get her level.<br><br>Was going really good until about 20 min after we were at the camp we both saw this monk run by us a couple times and head up into the rooms I guess looking for some spawns to kill.  So I then OOC'ed that window was camped.  Kanos ( the monk ) then OOC'ed that we should share the camp.  Now I know its nice to ask the people first to share the camp other than take it right from underneath them.<br><br>I mentioned to him that the zone is open and he should camp those ( since a soloing monk cant really hold a full window adds in wrong place).  Well he didn't want to and demanded again we share.  So knowing that I cant stop him from taking a few spawns I just went with it.  I tried to get as many of the spawns as I can before he got the agro, but he was getting some.<br><br>He once had 3 of the spawns on him and was also getting low on HP.  He asked me to take one, but I didn't want to take one cause he can call me a KSer since I took his agro,  and I was telling myself that if he gets in a bad situations and he realizes he shouldn't stay that he would leave.  Well he was only able to kill one of the 3 kobolds on him, then FDed when he was about to die and the mobs then agroed on to me.  I killed those mobs he Fded on to me and went on with the killing.<br><br>I walked up into a room and had 2 kobolds agro on me.  Without even asking if he can take one of those mobs that I can easily handle, he took the one I wasn't currently hitting but was agroed on me and KSed it before I could have outdmged him trying to KS.  I even warned him not to KS me and he did anyway.  I told him after the battle that he just KSed me and he said &quot; no I didn't, if anything you KSed me&quot;.  Well it went on and on with arguments about the situations and the Guide I called wasn't too much of a help (like they do much anyway).  He tried to tell me that me killing the 2 kobolds he FDed on me was KSing him even though he cleared his agro while FD.<br><br>But I just thought that all of you should know of this monk, He is currently Guildless (wonder why heheh ), he is very greedy and dishonorable since he demands people to share camps and then turns around and needs help when he cant deal with his agros. <p><BR><img src="http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/48/2329548.JPG" width=500 border=0></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucelinaheartworthy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CelinaHeartworthy</A> at: 11/19/01 9:58:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufaele.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faele</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/19/01 1:35:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> I'm really sorry that this happened to you, but if it makes you feel any better, you have a kick ass sig! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Faele Narsilion<Br>Uber Druish Princess of the 52nd Wandering<Br>First Officer and Consort <Br>Dogmatic Crucible<Br><Br><Br><b><i>Funny...she doesn't LOOK Druish......<b><i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udanosl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Danos L</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/19/01 2:11:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> no relation <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START |I --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tired.gif ALT="|I"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwandererz1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wandererz1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/19/01 3:28:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> I hate assholes like that, but I think this post would be better suited in the rants myself.  <br><br><br>Wandererz <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usijandistraightarrow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sijandistraightarrow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/19/01 4:38:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> Despite your opinion, Wandererz, this is a classic SL post. Deliberate KS'ing is a postable offense. Whether this is a sole incident or repeated behaviour will determine whether it will remain. Personally, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see verification of his actions because players who use this type borderline behaviour are usually well versed at it. Knowing they cannot hold a spawn area they will infringe on whoever is there, knowing they will probably be able to dump excess mobs on the other players in the area. Especially with a monk involved, FD and clearing aggro leaves a mob free to aggro on the nearest char. If events occurred as described, Kanos is guilty of deliberate KS'ing. Taking a mob which has already aggro'd another player without the consent or request of that player is KS'ing. Plain and simple. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubinoche.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Binoche</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/19/01 9:42:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> /agree Faele<br><br>very nice <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utellwar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TellWar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/19/01 10:25:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> Yeah, he only wanted to share because he couldn't hold the camp alone and his dispicable actions show it as such.... too bad FD worked then probably he would of been gone. <br><br>Unfortunately assholes like this find a home  like SolB and try to stay there forever... <br>I wonder why he didn't take Noble?

I wouldn't lift a finger to help him in any way after the attitude and behaviour exhibited. That is one good  thing about being in that position. There is no obligation to assist another players under any circumstances. If someone doesn't want to be courteous, considerate and cooperative that player can hardly expect anyone to assist. It's not one of my better personality traits, but I have stood and laughed at players such as they die. Normally I'm more than willing to help other players, asking only recognition as another person - not being treated like an npc, such as saying hello before asking for ANYTHING - or approaching in a roleplay manner. For players who thinks it's perfectly acceptable to walk up and say something such as &quot;SOW PlZ ThX&quot; I have no inclination to assist in any manner. It doesn't take much effort to show a little courtesy. Saying hello to another person before asking for anything, no matter how small, is the least a person should expect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ustryyfe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stryyfe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/20/01 4:44:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> I am Kanos, the Dishonorable Monk.<br><br>The situation was pretty well explained by the guy who posted the flame, i'll just give a brief overview.<br><br>Most monks will tell you, FD works in several different ways, You can FD a mob totally off of you and never touch it again, pull off a quick FD and wait briefly for that mend to finally show up again, or you can FD adds and pull one to a group, these are a few ways. In the first case he discussed, I was fighting one single Kobold at first, sharing the camps/spawns as we pretty much agreed.  During the battle, another Kobold spawned just as he showed up to attempt to watch me die. I said...&quot;You can take one&quot; ...because I was not hogging the mobs and could have killed both, He only stood there, to hope that I died, so he could reap the reward, during this time, another kobold spawned on top of that, I killed the first one, leaving 2 left.  I fd'd to wait for mend to come up which was only about 30 seconds afterward. During that time, he then and only then started attacking the adds. Now I have no problem with those kills both being his, because I did feign death leaving them pretty much open to anyone, which is kind of an iffy situation in it's own, depending on the monks ways.  My entire point was the fact that he stood there waiting for me to die, which is kind of ok in one sense, but a little messed up in another.  I then mended, and got up, and ran looking for more of the spawns at random since we did not decide on any set spawns.  As I walked into the room he was attacking one Kobold, and another one had just spawned and turned his way and threw a punch, At this time I really honestly didnt know that he knew if he was fighting 2 of them, and simply hit the one he was not attacking. Now it may have been bad on my part and some can argue that it wasn't. Sometimes we ask people if they need help, sometimes we assume they do, sometimes we think they wont mind if one is taken, sometimes they will.  It's not a special camp, there was probably several kobolds spawned besides this one, yeah thats true, but tell me how big of a deal it really is in SOLB (Train City) and mass confusion, to attack one of the 2 kobolds in a room of the camp you are sharing? Worth calling a GM? Worth posting a 5 page essay on the lanys boards? Or worth replying to the 5 page essay? Nahh, I think not. The thing that should piss you off on a Kill steal is the blatent running up to your little called area, hacking away at the mob you are currently fighting, taking the EXP and loot. Lets try not to blow things like this in places like that out of proportion peoples. I was in the wrong, He was in the wrong, yet none of it was serious. As for the GM, it always depends on the situation and GM as to who's fault it was, and who should do what, but all it boils down to is that one of the people either leaves, they share, the person logs, you make a friend, you make an enemy. Now you can all jump on the bandwagon and be against this disastrous and unbelieveable deed that I have done if you wanna, but take a look at the overall outcome and meaning.

Losing aggro on the mob also loses your right to claim the mob. Period. If no one else is around, then the monk is free to reaggro the mob. If anyone else is in the vicinity they are free to take the mob after the FD. Not the nicest thing to do, but perfectly within the rules. When a monk FD's and the mob aggro's on another player, that mob then belongs to the player it aggro'd. Whether you like it or not, and whether you agree or not. It is not at the discretion of the monk. To use this tactic a monk must first make sure his FD will not dump the mob on another player. If it occurs, it is not a violation of the rules unless the dumping was deliberate - an attempt to force another player to either defend themself or leave. A very dirty tactic and a clear violation. If/when the monk gets up and attacks the mob again after it has aggro'd on another player is KS'ing. Plain and simple. Whenever you attack a mob aggro'd on another player without their permission it is an act of KS'ing. Sometimes this is unintentional, but when the player informs you to leave their mob alone and you ignore them it is indeed a deliberate act of KS'ing. If anyone else supports this post with other incidents which violate the rules or the community standards you can expect this post to remain. You may view this as beneath your notice, but it didn't seem to stop you from posting to defend your actions, and then making a personal attack on the poster. A typical response when a person is on shaky ground and feeling defensive about inappropriate actions. The best and safest way to avoid this type of situation is NEVER attack a mob aggro'd on another player without that player either giving explicit permission or directly asking for help.<br>Honor is in our actions, not in defending those actions.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usijandistraightarrow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sijandistraightarrow</A> at: 11/27/01 8:40:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushutshut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shut Shut</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/25/01 11:48:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=703.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webshots.com/photos/imgs3/63/20363-small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> HUggGGS KAnos .... i know him ... hes a nice fella ....  <br>Cant we all just get along ??///???///??///????
