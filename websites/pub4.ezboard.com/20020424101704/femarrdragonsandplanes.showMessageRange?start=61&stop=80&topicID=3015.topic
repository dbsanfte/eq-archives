the hate runs thick around here. i swear it was the 1950s, "what! you dont think like the rest of us?! GET HER!!" you'd think i'd not be surprised by this type of stuff anymore.<br>

heh. <br>
[/quote]<br>
<br>
The only way you could even possibly truly believe what you just said here is if you think that any attack on your own personal beliefs about racism (and its evils) to be an attack on racism itself as a social ill. <br>
<br>
You wanna know my reaction to this story? Well damn, that shit sucks. Coulda almost been me because half the time I'm a nicer guy than the next. Do I think his pointing out of the racial make-up was the smartest thing in the world to do? No, but he was using a stereotype to try to paint a picture of what happened. Did his story somehow not fit the stereotypical actions of a bunch of black drug dealers in relation to an outnumbered white guy who ended up in their area?<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, how would you react to the ethnic differences that led to a lot of bad blood around the turn of the century? Is the (you claim) racist story here somehow more important to protest against than the petty disputes the italians, irish, polish, or germans took part in? You could very easily have switched black with italian, and white with irish, ,or whoever the fuck the italians are supposed to hate <Shrug>.<br>
<br>
And before you get your panties in a twist, I come from south central PA, where racism was/is alive and strong when I grew up there. My father brought a black man to a white bar, got him banned from the bar, his tires slashed, and keys broken off in his locks.  I knew of maybe half a dozen black children in my high school, the rest had been efficiently run out of the county by the KKK.  <br>
<br>
Your pathetic attempt to make his story sound like its about black people, and not about his mistake of being too nice and the trouble that caused, is offensive to the cause of rational fighters against racism, at least to me.  Whether or not you'll realize that just because people disagree with you it doesn't mean they're out to oppress you, I'll never know. Good luck.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I once saw a show in Asbury Park, NJ at the Stone Pony, which ended at about 1:30am. That entire area is all projects(projects = low income housing), and at 2am it looked just like it was 2pm. There were people all over the streets. They weren’t kids on bicycles or joggers or schoolteachers, they were hookers and hoods.

<br>
Holy deja vu, that's almost exactly the same kind of anecdote I was going to post.  I used to live in Chicago, and went to see a band called Mark Burgess &amp; The Sons of Gods on the South Side of town around 1993 or so.  This was in an area that was undergoing gentrification.  Lots of young, hip, white folks moving in and displacing the poor black and Hispanic people who'd been there previously.  <br>
<br>
My friend and I had arrived in one of those little convertible Mazdas that were so popular for a while, a nice shiny red one.  When the show was over, around midnight, it was still very warm outside so he put the top down and we set off on what we thought was a shortcut.<br>
<br>
We wound up driving right through the heart of the Cabrini Green housing projects.  <br>
<br>
For those of you who don't know, the Cabrini Green projects are among the worst in the United States in terms of documented squalor and violence.  They were featured prominently in the film CANDYMAN.<br>
<br>
So there we were, two white guys in our mid-20's, driving through Cabrini Green at midnight.  The stoops in front of all the buildings were still filled with large crowds of people; the insides of their apartments must have been sweltering.  In the red convertible we must have looked a sight to them.  Everyone's eyes were on us as we drove through, and crowds of young men began moving toward the sidewalk.<br>
<br>
Beer cans started flying through the air at us.<br>
<br>
My friend shoved his foot down on the accelerator and we got out of there as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
We were in the wrong place and we were the wrong color, and violence was already occurring because of it.  I still shudder when I think about that night.  <br>
<br>
I would love for the world to be colorblind, but unfortunately it just isn't.  As someone else in this thread stated, it's easy to be colorblind when you've lived a life of privilege.  But there are hell of a lot more people who don't live a life of privilege, and they're pretty damn unhappy, and they see colors pretty damn clearly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 748<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/11/02 1:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3015.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ever met a crackwhore?</span><hr size=1> I'd like to comment on this thread, but perceived bias makes that a bad, bad, option.<br>

Glad your still alive. Sometimes things dont work out so well.<br>
<br>
And for the others with the 'race war',<br>
<br>
all I can do is laugh..here &lt;hahahahahaha&gt;<br>
<br>
and comment.<br>
<br>
I know many black people who would NOT enter neighborhoods like that either. Compton, LA; certain areas of Detroit; Im sure New York is the same way; and other various parts of the globe where ALL sorts of color resides(Black,White,Red,Yellow,Pink,Blue,Purple,etc).<br>
In fact, I remember what a friend of mine told me when he did find himself on the streets of Compton. He is black, and he was scared as well.(kinda hard not to be when someone keeps flashing their gun outside a 7-11)And he even commented on the FACT that it is a pre-dominantly black neighborhood. Cept he used a term other than Black. (Im thinkin I dont need to spell it out) Unless you grow up in that area, well, your an outsider.<br>
<br>
 Its not the skin color, its the people. No matter the skin color, the problem comes with the way of life those people want to partake in. Crime, Drugs, Prostitution etc..<br>
<br>
 Just like I know Mexican people's who dont particularly like walking down South 6th in Tucson after mid-night,(hell, even Nogales)<br>
and a statement of black population 0, white population 0, mexican population 100%, would be a rather accurate way of getting that point across. Racist? Dont think so. accurate way of telling a story? yep.<br>
<br>
And Indians who wont go certain places on a reservation after mid-night. (and thats ALL Indian, only place you would find white folk, or black folk, or any other folk  would be the casino's)<br>
<br>
Same could be said about places in China, or Russia, or Australia im sure.<br>
<br>
Is this all a way of saying everyone is racist? I think not. Its more of stating, that some people dont enjoy being a part of the lifestyle that some choose to take. In fact most actively stay away from it. Poverty, drug deals, prostitutes etc.. are NOT reserved for certain colors or races or the young or the elder, etc.. Any can follow that path, its whether or not they choose too. <br>
<br>
And before people start screaming that many are BORN into the problem and cant leave that life..I will scoff at you..and point and laugh. Its an amazing world out there, many, many, many choices to be made. Some people just have their priorities screwed.<br>
<br>
Its not the color of people, its the people, and everyone is reading a little too much in Elnots post. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukylienjellybean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kylien Jellybean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/12/02 3:38:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3015.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ever met a crackwhore?</span><hr size=1> haha I'm not gonna read the entire thing I'm in a hurry.<br>

I'm a straight, white collar, white american male.  I served in the Marines, so had the military look for a while.  Go back a few more years, I spent my teens growing up in and around the streets of New Orleans (rough way to grow up.. but gets you there quick).  My roots were redneck Mississippi.  I had an entirely different look during each of these time periods, I'm sure my attitude and behavior were vastly different as well. <br>
<br>
The point to all this is, in each time, my appearance matched the comfort zone around me.  I couldn't walk into my current job wearing my leather biker jacket and steel toed boots from New Orleans, I'd be fired.  It would seriously impact the comfort of those around me.  If I walked into my old neighborhood wearing my suit and tie from work.. I'd probably get cut.  The same goes for walking into one of my past Marine watering holes.  Civilians just weren't welcome there.<br>
<br>
Going through that area in a decent car PERIOD was dumb as hell, unless you happen to be a big man in the area, in which case no one would mess with your shit.  <br>
<br>
To the person talking about actions bringing out the rage and racism in someone.  Those actions are the result of that individual, or group of individuals decisions.  NOT the actions of a race.  <br>
<br>
As far as getting pushed to that point of being racist, when I was a teen, I was in a fight with a black guy.  I was getting the better of him so his brother walked up and shot me.  I guess his brother was a nice guy... he only shot me in the leg to take me out of the fight.  I've been cut/stabbed by both blacks and whites (told ya it was a rough neighborhood) so I dont see that as a racial thing.  <br>
<br>
After all the crap that's happened, my best friend is actually a gay black guy.  I wont say I wouldn't feel nervousness and unease being in that neighborhood mentioned before, or even in my own old neighborhood.  YES, I would be defensive.. constantly on my guard and watching everyone, especially those who looked suspicious.  That's self preservation.  What I wouldn't do is assume that since I was a different color, they were all out to get me.<br>
<br>
It's time to judge people by WHO they are.. not WHAT they are.  (Doesn't mean drag your dumb ass somewhere you obviously dont belong so you can be broken!) <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

<br>
My wounds are healing nicely, I still draw stares though and have cashiers ask me about the &quot;fight&quot; I was in. So I'm guessing it'll be maybe a week or two for them to leave me alone. <br>
<br>
Total injuries :<br>
<br>
slashes on left cheek mixed with bruises *slashes caused massive amounts of bleeding which confused everyone into thinking I didn't have half my face*<br>
black eye<br>
bruised nose *nose of steel, never breaks*<br>
split upper and lower lip<br>
bruise on ear and behind it in the shape of an ear<br>
bruises on back of head and neck<br>
gash in chin<br>
loose molar<br>
bruise in rib<br>
and what looks like some really fucked up hickies where I was being choked.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now on to the race war!<br>
<br>
I didn't say the population thing because I was being racist, I was stating a fact. Everyone I saw was black, the freaking police department said that everyone there was black. And if they see white people driving around it they pull them over and search their cars.<br>
<br>
The POLICE do this!<br>
<br>
If I hadn't said what I did. You would be missing out a large peice of the descriptive puzzle.<br>
<br>
Why would the cop pull over someone like me? Well because I'm wh***.<br>
<br>
Color plays a role in many things.. Live with it. It's utopian liberalists that live middleclass or higher lives that see no color.<br>
<br>
If I walk up to a black guy and say, wassup mah nigga?<br>
<br>
He'll kill me where I stand. Why? Because you don't say that to a black guy... unless you yourself are black of course. <br>
<br>
But let me add this too. There's different types of people in every class. There's white trash, and there's black trash, just as there's asian trash and canadian trash.<br>
<br>
Even though there's more Canadian trash than any of the others.<br>
<br>
Just kidding, I actually love Canada, it's just like America except nobody lives there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So anyhoo. There's all types of people from each different race. There's bad types of each, you have to be wary of those types.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying if you see a black guy walking up to you with gangsta style clothes on and a forty in his hand or a white guy with a mullet and flannel over coveralls and a jug of moonshine that you should not speak to them, but just be wary that before you just open right up to them you find out what they're all about.<br>
<br>
Take shots at it if you want. I'm just saying not everyone dressed dangerously is dangerous. But sometimes they are. Insects will mimic predators of their predators to scare them away. Some people mimic hoods to make themselves look tougher. <br>
<br>

When you're in a freaky situation like the one Elnots was in, time gets all messed up and so does personal judgement.  It's easy for an outside observer to ask, &quot;Oh, why didn't you just do this to end the problem?&quot;  But unless you were in the middle of similar messed up crap, you really have no right to pass judgement.  One's head does not necessarily think straight when you have a crack whore in the car and have several thugs advancing on you.<br>
<br>
There's no reason for Elnots to have made this up.  None whatsoever.  He wasn't trying to make an excuse for himself, or trying to instigate trouble, or point the finger at anyone to cover up for something he had done himself.  He just had an extremely nasty event in his life that he needed to share, and he shared it with us. <p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mlaye" target="_blank">

It was 5 guys. I dunno if I said 20 or 25 like these conflicting reports are saying but it was and I quote &quot;5&quot; guys in the car.<br>
<br>
Yes I did file a police report. Fact is I drove (with the woman in the car) to the gas station by the freeway got out, stumbled inside and said,&quot; Someone call the police.&quot;<br>
<br>
Next thing I know I was standing in the bathroom staring at myself in the mirror till the cops got there.<br>
<br>
The woman took off into the night. haven't and hope not to see her again.<br>
<br>
When I started talking to the cops I lit a cigarette to try to calm me down *was in shock shaking like a baby* and they told me to put it out. I did and put it in my coat pocket.<br>
<br>
Today I put the coat back on again and found the cigarette in my pocket. I thought it was hilarious cause the entire butt end of the cigarette is coated in dried blood. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/13/02 7:45:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3015.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Down here in Heidelberg, Melbourne, we have Somali and Koori black communities. There is a racial skin difference and some native turf ownership 'respect' issues may be going on with younger native Australian 'Koori's'. The local Somali restaraunt is cruised by school aged Aussie koori girls, bouncing a basketball, these girls are deeeeep 'black'. Maybe they are just headed on home from school. Is it a coincidence there is African 'turf' along their way?<br>
<br>
Somalis have Mediterranean olive tanned complexions beside these Koories. <br>
<br>
One remembers the Somali 'African' restaraunt has inexplicably had its front window smashed, once or twice, which is surprising since these Somalis are docile, quiet people. Aloof, proud tribal snobs even. Then one see's the pointed look of the girls in the direction of the restaraunt window, perhaps racial trouble is brewing here. The window has been fixed. <br>
<br>
Incredibly, our little shopping mall is frequented by most Somali shoppers living in State public housing surrounding the local area and sales hands don't know what has been cooked in pork fat, what has pork in it (slice of pizza, buddy?)and whether it makes any diff. to a Somali. <br>
<br>
The Somali butcher went out of business. <br>
<br>
There is an African fast food shop, a Tailor shop and a traditional African haberdashery and the African restaraunt, 'Waberi', as the main African hangout: proportionately five businesses are run by Chinese(newsagent, variety, and 2 small Supermarkets, 1 fast food) 2 Fish and Chips shops are Greek run, the corner take-away is Egyptian I think? A new church is going up, 4 church/hospital (Co-operative) opportunity shops and 3 private hairdressers, a fast loans shark, Tae Kwon Do joint, 1 Aussie butcher (the other does mostly chicken and is chinese) and 2 Aussie chemists (pharmaceuticals), a Lawyer, Bank, and the local State member of Parliament. There is also 'Blockbuster video'  and a factory seconds clothing store, plus a Men's clothing store, a Drycleaner's, a Coin Laundrette, and an italian Greengrocer. <br>
<br>
The local mosque is seven street blocks away and draws mostly arabic peoples of which there are a goodly number in Heidelberg also. The one white guy I saw racially abuse Somali schoolkids was encircled by them in an eye blink, they were like vets and no older than 12. I think he was lucky to get away since he put himself in a right fix there.<br>
<br>
So Africans are digging their roots in. Some people don't like the african pride thing, I don't give a damn about the neighborhood mix. If real shit started maybe, but our local Somalis are far too concerned with starting families and keeping their jobs. They have to show their face to each other: I never hated anyone for that.<br>

<br>
Wow, Elnots is white? Like it makes a difference, eh. The poor guy wasn't preaching sedition or racial vilification, he was steered into a 'red light' district in strange territory he had never seen before. Doing somebody a favor they asked from him. <br>
Shit happens between black races, it happens between religions; he wasn't prejudiced about their neighborhood. First time there he'd ever seen it. How did he preconcieve that impression, the bitch was white, yes? He was set up: Police didn't give his statement credit. Probably never reported it, I don't know they did anything at all that should have been normal procedure. I'd fire shitheads like that for gross omission of fact, if I was their boss. No matter how trivial. But anyway they can choose to advise him they will take no action and file that instead, maybe they did, provided it recorded the assault (no conclusions) they would still be doing their job correctly.<br>

As many have pointed out we don't live in a Utopian society.  I will grant you this, a preconception based on color is wrong, but being blind to lifestyle differences is still being blind.  Chinatown, no one ever says anything bad about that right?  Chinatown is fun, hell the MCI center advertises that it is in Chinatown, an are populated by almost 100% asians, not chinese.  Isn't that racist?<br>
<br>
I will give you an even better one.  Racial communities are typically formed based on prejudice and a need to feel together with people of your own kind.  Chinatown exists because the people who live there wanted to be among people of their own race, they don't want YOU there if your not asian.<br>
<br>
Now hows about some socio-economics.<br>
High Income people, due not as much to racism but to having a history in this country are typically white.  Things have changed alot in recent years due to the fine work that was done by our parents and grandparents.  People of different races have had the ability to own property, establish a family and thus a history.  It's that history of family accomplishment that allows the children of these families to accomplish better things.  This is best illustrated by Washington, DC...<br>
<br>
Washington, DC had excellent schools, roads and government, it was the epitome of American society.  People eager to develop a history and give children a better chance at a better future saw this.  Due to the higher income of DC residents (taxes) the schools are better, so go find a house next to the dump (because no one with money wants to live there) that gets your kids into the best schools for less taxes, because you make less money.  Other people do the same and slums are formed.  These slums drive down the value of surrounding areas, the higher class folk that lived there not only don't want to see you, not only don't want to live near you, but don't want their children in school with yours.  Queue suburbia.  As more and more of the higher income families start leaving the budget grows smaller and a city used to being able to spend money now has to cut back.  Schools and roads are typically first cut.<br>
Now I have single family home communites in suburbia, strip malls develop, counties become better than cities in education and upkeep.  Land value skyrockets, none of the poor families who could afford an apartment near the dump can afford a single family home.  Now they are screwed.  Things are worse than before, the downward spiral is complete.  Only higher taxes can keep the city running, higher rents on the clum apartments just to keep them running.  Not enough income on rent to provide for upkeep of the buildings/etc/etc/etc.<br>
<br>
So Lluna, before your blind to color, look real close at it, see what it has caused people to do.  So why and how it can be dangerous.  Study it and overcome it.  If you choose to stay blind, do it by yourself and don't take the rest of us down with your blindness.<br>
<br>
I choose to see color, in everyone everywhere, I see race, I see religion, I see income levels.  I love variety, I love the world around me and everyday I know that the reason I have the life I do is because my family has worked hard for me for a very long time.  I choose to see, not cover my eyes and pretend it isn't there. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>
