<br>
<br>
At work today the subject of ex-partners went round and I went into nostalgia mode. Now, I like a good rant and it gets me to thinking about why I actually split up with some of those people, many that I spent a lot of time with over my formative years. <br>
<br>
If I ever told you the line “It’s not you…it’s me” or “I think we worked better as friends” well then, open your lugs cos now it’s about time that you learnt the truth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”He knows how to land”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Listen, I don’t care how staged you think it is. If I throw you 15ft off the top rope onto a table its gonna fucking hurt. Did you see any theatrics there love? No. He bounced. Plain and simple.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”Why can’t we go with you?”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Because it’s lads night. That’s the whole fucking point. Friday night down the pub is a ritual and if I wanted to talk to that skinny freak you call a friend about how bad her boyfriend is in bed, then I wouldn’t have been born with a dick. Do you actually have any idea how embarrassing it is to ask the barman for 8 pints of beer and a Multiple Orgasm?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”I faked it!”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
What? 3 times? I’m sorry but I don’t believe that. Maybe if you’d only faked it once but three times has got to be considered overacting. I am sorry that I fell asleep five minutes later when you just wanted to talk about it but did it not enter your head that I was a little tired? There was no need to bring this up over cornflakes the next day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”I wasn’t following you.”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Like hell you weren’t. I travel 120 miles on a business trip and out of the corner of my eye I catch you shopping for a dress? I don’t care that your ex-boyfriend cheated on you but I’m beginning to see why. Leave me the hell alone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”It was like that in the first place”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
How retarded do you actually think I am? I know my suit wasn’t that small before you put it in the washing machine simply because Minime wouldn’t fit into it anymore. Do you seriously believe I’m going to think “Yes, I see now, I’ve grown bigger.” It looks like it comes from Adam’s Childrenswear for Christ’s sake. The label at the back clearly says Dry Clean Only, I know cos it scratches the hell out of the back of my neck when I wear it. And no, a diet will not help me get back into it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”It’s supposed to taste like this”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Burnt and hard? No I didn’t think so. Why don’t you just admit you mixed up Centigrade and Fahrenheit again? Lying isn’t going to convince me that this black crispy rock is a pie. I think I’ll use it to wedge under my wheels to stop my car rolling off the ramps when I fix the engine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”I’ll tell you why….”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Please don’t. I have neither desire nor obligation to listen to the full un-edited discussion based on the inner workings of your body. All I said was I was feeling a little frisky but I honestly don’t need the complete discourse of sanitary application. Two words would have sufficed then I would have rolled over and gone to sleep.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”You said you wanted to watch the sport”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Listen you malingering tart! Dressage is not sport. You have the cheek to come to my house, to my TV, to watch some guy prancing around on a horse wearing a top hat and a red jacket. How fucking sad is that? The horse has got more of a glimmer of intelligence then that fop of a rider. Give the guy a lance I say and let’s see how fucking smart he looks then. Eight women in a pool waving their arms around in time to the beat of the nutcracker suite is not an art form, it’s not sport, it is in fact without a shadow of a doubt, no two ways about it boring as shit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”it’s not big and it’s not clever”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It isn’t supposed to be clever but oh yes it is big. That’s the way Cuban cigars are meant to be you imbecile. They’re my curtains so why are you worried about how they’re going to smell for the next month? Quite frankly my dear I don’t give a damn that it makes your teyes hurt a little, but I smoke one of these very rarely and it’s not going to kill me. That is of course unless I choke on it whilst listening to your next round of verbal diarrhoea you mad cow.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”hmmph…Men!!!”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Ok this one was a little inspired by this mornings reading rather then any ex-girlfriend but sheesus girl, what’s with you? You don’t like men all that much do you, happy to screw them mind when it boil’s down to it you hate men because they’re so sexist and treat women as inferiors. Not only do you hate one man based on his actions you summarily target every man and tar him with that same brush because they are such horrible bastards. You generalize that all men treat women so badly and for all you care they can all fuck off. Your hypocrisy gland is overactive. Have you seen a doctor about it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”But it’s going to need stitches!! Warrgh”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Oh lord, never ever get pregnant. It’s a scratch on your leg. Look, there’s hardly any blood. Oh well maybe a little but I’m not going to trouble 999 ( that’s 911 to you American freaks ) with that pathetic little excuse for a battle wound. How many times do I have to tell you that using a blunt razor will not reduce your chances of cutting yourself? I’ve been shaving my chin for years now and I learnt my lesson the hard way and I’ll bet there’s many men that have walked into work with half a roll of bog-roll patching their faces together. I’m sure you’ll live. Keep whining and I might narrow your chances.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”How old are you?”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I’m twenty-fucking-four, how old are you? Now shut the hell up cos this is the bit where Jerry hits Tom over the head with the cello. Yes, I do like to watch the odd cartoon and no it does not mean I have the mental age of a 5 year old. Perhaps you’ll accept that if I hit you over the head with a cello.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ”But that’s 12…not 10.”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Listen lady. That’s what we call men’s prerogative. You women have woman’s prerogative and just like your woman’s instinct you think that’s gender specific. It’s not, OK? So if I want to call twelve, ten, then there’s not a damn thing you can do about it because I’m writing this post and your not. Why the hell can’t you just stay out of it when it’s clearly not your post? If you think you can do any better do your own.<br>
<br>

Most amusing.<br>
<br>
Now, mine is gonna be from the opposite end, but lets give it a whirl.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ”Why can’t we go with you?”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This works the opposite way too, fyi. Girls night out is just that. Girls. We don't want you to come. We want to put a slinky dress on, get toasted, dance with guys we'll never see again and stumble home smiling. You glowering from the table at us doesn't exactly inspire that get loose feeling. Be happy. That cute young stud who dances with me all night is the reason I don't boot you out for never taking me anywhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ”I faked it!”<br>
What? 3 times? I’m sorry but I don’t believe that. Maybe if you’d only faked it once but three times has got to be considered overacting.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sometimes it's easier to fake it then spend 30 minutes (3x longer than you normally last anyway) explaining what you're not doing right. Sometimes, the sooner it's over, the sooner I can get back to filing my nails. (Disclaimer: this does not apply to all men...a few know what they are doing)<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ”It was like that in the first place”<br>
How retarded do you actually think I am? I know my suit wasn’t that small before you put it in the washing machine simply because Minime wouldn’t fit into it anymore<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
She did it on purpose, but besides that. No, my white silk underwear haven't always been pink. Only since you washed them with your red sweatshirt have they been pink. Pink underwear is okay, better if it's not got that tie-dyed effect, but I'd still like to have a couple of white pairs left. Stop pulling my delicacies out of the hamper to sniff them or whatever the hell you do, because I know they didn't get wrapped up in your sweatshirt on their own.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I just wanted to say goodbye...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Sure you did. Perhaps there's a better way about going about it then sneaking past the security guards at my employer, holding a sword and a box of comics and knocking on the door where I'm having a meeting to declare that your life is over and you just want me to have your precious belongings before you drive off of a bridge.<br>
<br>
Newsflash hon, I don't want the comics, and altho the sword would certainly come in handy to give you your last wish, you're too much of a pussy to have it sharpened and so the best I could do is use the hilt end to beat you down. Trust me, I considered it, right before the cops hauled you away.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> When are you coming back?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Never. I moved 3 states away, didn't leave a forwarding address and didn't give you my new phone number. Did it occur to you that I might be getting away from you, you psycho loser? In the 10 years since I moved, I've married. I'm not coming back. It might be time to move on.<br>
Just because you tracked down my phone number on the internet does not mean I want to hear from you. I knew where you were, how could I not, since you call my relatives everytime you move to let them know how I can get a hold of you. Have I called? No, so suck it up and see if you can get on with your pathetic life. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Does this mean you're leaving me?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Considering we're in a bar, and I just said for the third time I&quot;m getting a ride home with someone else and I never want to see you again, yes. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No means no</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I meant it when I said I didn't want to convert to catholicism so your parents wouldn't be upset when we married. Considering it was our third date, I didn't feel the commitment was there. Also, I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but you kiss like a dead fish. You are the only man who made me want to vomit when you touched me. I don't think it's going to work out. Take your money and go buy someone who can stand you, even the promise of fast cars, money and total home stability for the rest of my life wasn't enough to get me past the fish bit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You be Thor, I'll be Wolverine</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I'll admit, that litte comment right before you attacked the guy I was seeing is semi amusing in retrospect. I think sharpening your nails to points was a bit much tho, I had to take him in to get stitches. As I tried to explain to you right before you got your ass kicked by Wolverine, you're not a norse god, he's not a comic book hero. He also had a foot on you, you short fuck, and outweighed you by about 100 lbs. You were on the losing end to begin with. While I'll admit I thought it was noble of him to try to talk you out of it, I'll admit I got sick pleasure out of watching him hand your ass to you. In fact, I'm giggling now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Why is there a guy answering your phone?!?!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Because he spent the night. Since we aren't seeing each other, and you don't pay my bills, you don't get to call me at work to ask me these kinds of questions. For the record, altho I told you we were sleeping together, we didn't. I said that in the hopes you would get a clue and go away. It didn't work. The 4 dozen roses you sent me the next day made sure I was clear on that one.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes I am leaving.<br>
<br>
No it isnt because you have put on a few pounds. I like you better this way now rather than the skin and bones you were when we met.<br>
<br>
No it isnt because of the 12 cats in our two bedroom apt. (Though that was the beginning.)<br>
<br>
No it wasn't because you became an animal rights activist while I was working at a Fur coat store, and my mother has owned a fur coat store for 20 years. <br>
<br>
No it wasnt because I couldnt talk about work because of all the poor little animals we murdered hurt your feelings.<br>
<br>
No it wasnt because you became a vegitarian 6 months after we met due to a little friend that also convinced you that fur is bad and 12 cats isnt too many. (And I eat few vegitables)<br>
<br>
No it wasnt because the new &quot;guy friend&quot; friend you had was a bully back in grade school who made my life a living hell for the year it took me to get the guts up to deck him.<br>
<br>
No it wasnt the 2 am wake ups because you were not feeling good and needed to get something to eat due to your lack of research at what happens to a body when you cut off it's animal protien intake and feed it a crapload of lettuce because the other things don't taste good. (Grumble okay maybe it was a little bit of that)<br>
<br>
I am leaving because after almost 2 years of knowing you and a year of dating you and 8 month's of living together. The confident capable woman I loved, has become a whiny, vegitarian, close minded, animals are more important than humans, half starved, poorly nutritioned, nutjob that unfortuntly took over the woman I loved body and soul and left me the broken remains.<br>
<br>
(Insert Sam Kinison-like scream of primal rage here)<br>
<br>
Whew. <br>
<br>
I feel better. (Grins)<br>

<br>
    Want me to do something for you? Sure I am happy to but, don't stand over my shoulder and harpy me to death about how to do it. Conversly, If I am doing something I don't mind some helpful insight but, will be doing it on my own time scheduale and I dont need you planning my little &quot;fun&quot; projects for me.<br>
<br>
2) Lets just be friends<br>
<br>
     You rip out my heart step on it a few times and kick it across the floor. Sorry, I don't really feel like being friendly and don't really want to go to your wedding a year later.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) I want to be your girlfriend.<br>
<br>
     You jump in the sack with me on the first date, do you truly expect me to take you seriously after one night? Do you think rushing the relationship thing is gonna make me respect you more after what we just did. Be a woman, be coy, make me pine for you, not the other way around. <br>
<br>
4) We just need to take a break.<br>
<br>
    Sorry but, I am an on or off kinda guy when it comes to relationships, we either work at it or split up. I am not your security blanket. <br>
<br>
5) You are just too good for me.<br>
<br>
    If the relationship was so fucking good why the hell did ya leave? If i treated you better than anyone else did why the hell don't you stick with it. Yea, your last few boyfriends were abusive assholes, I agree, I guess you like getting your ass beat.<br>
<br>

"Damn, you're boring."<br>

4) We just need to take a break.<br>
"I'm tired to death of everything about you, but I don't want to hurt your feelings too much."<br>
