<br>
Reading through here and who should I find Flaming you, but Cogito!  Oh yes, I know him.  See, I was a guide on Tribunal for a long time, that being Cogito's play server, as when I would keep track of the boards there I would invariably see Cogito spewing his vapid crap.  I resigned from the program about three months ago, but I still remember his name well and recognized it immediately, as a testament to how annoying the little pissant is.  Of course, at the time I couldn't respond to his posts, but now I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Part of what's below is directed at Cogito, but it's generally a few things I wanted to get off my chest.<br>
<br>
First of all, Cogito, unless you want to roll up your sleeves and put some effort towards helping others in a very tough volunteer position, STFU.  Really, that's about it.  If you want to be supportive, great.  If you want to be constructive, fantastic, guides appreciate constructive criticism.  If you want to come on and flame, and rant about corruption, and what a victim you are and how you have been mistreated, then please just spare all of us.  I wasn't the only guide on Trib who knew your name (and probably am still not), and while I know you would be helped within the terms of our guidelines, you certainly haven't made any friends among the guides there.  And since guiding is largely a set of judgement calls (however much the rules try and make everything black and white, and make judgement calls unnecessary), it's better to be on good terms with those making the decisions, than alienating yourself.  Now, I'm not saying suck up to the guides, kiss their ass and all.  No, I'm saying treat guides with a degree of respect, and you will find that respect is returned.<br>
<br>
You may not think that Guides will remember you, but largely it's the same 50 people petitioning 90% of the time, and we definitly do remember the regulars, and as Tweety said, the half dozen guides who actually regularly show up for work, DO TALK.  We know who the bad eggs are, you're not fooling us, and we're watching you.  Maybe not you Cogito, I don't recall you being a bad egg or a troublemaker, mostly just someone who reguarly goes to whine and start shit on the boards.  So since you've probably never received any sort of official response before, you can consider this one:<br>
<br>
Your guides know about you, your thoughts and your feelings about them, and for the most part they feel pretty much the same about you.  The thing is, they don't have to like you to do what they do, they'll still help you if you are in a situation that warrants it, but you haven't made any friends.<br>
<br>
On a final note, about judgement calls, I wanted to talk about special treatment.  Frankly, yes, there is some special treatment for some players, simply from the fact that a guide has to look at the evidence and decide if they believe someone or not, in some cases.  However much VI would like guiding to be black and white, right and wrong, it isn't.  Now I can't speak for everyone, and I know guides who stuck more firmly to the word of the rules, and I know guides who pretty much stuck by their own conscience, and both were good guides.  I was somewhere in the middle and stuck between the word and what I felt was the spirit of the rules.  Who got special treatment from me?  Not the uberguilds, not the players that paged me every time I was on to say Hi and ask how I was doing (and generally kiss my ass), not people who claimed to be guides or have friends who are guides.  The people that I would most often give the benefit of the doubt to, when the occasion permitted, were those who were polite, to the point, rational and reasonable, and sincere.  Those are people I identified with, the type of people I feel deserved the benefit of the doubt, the type that didn't alienate me or waste time that could have been used to help others, and essentailly exhibited the type of behavior that I believe deserves to be rewarded.<br>
<br>
So in parting, ranting at guides is not going to get you anywhere.  All guides have, at one time or another, been subject to some of the most vile personal attacks by some of the slimiest denizens of Norrath.  After that, a guide either realizes that they don't feel like the abuse and quit, or they harden themselves and any other attacks like that run off them like water off a duck's back.  Don't waste your breath, all you'll do is annoy the guide and if you annoy them enough they'll actually remember your name, which isn't a good thing.  So treat guides with respect, and they will do the same for you.  Guides WILL help you whenever they are able, they want to, and often when they know you deserve it but they also know that they still can't help, you miss out on the guide being angry and frustrated and ranting on your behalf on the guide channel.  <br>
<br>
95% of guides do NOT powertrip, you do NOT pay their salary (what salary?), and they do NOT need to be there.  When players come down on guides, the usual resut is a weakening of resolve in the more experienced guides, those that are starting to feel burnt out from the job.  When you drive off those guides that know their job well, are well beyond the novelty of the 'powers', and are motivated purely by the desire to help their fellow players, you hurt your own position as they are necessarily replaced by guides who are new and inexperienced, and often those that score lower on the entrance tests simply because the pool for guides is finite.  You get rid of the guides that get the 'A' on their test, and end up with guides who scored a 'C' or 'D', simply because there is a need for bodies.  The fault is only partly with the abusive players, but they are certainly a contributing factor.<br>
<br>
Okay, really stopping now, to leave off I'll quote Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure: Be Excellent to One Another! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In all the flames I have read, on all the boards I have visited in all my days (okay, it hasn't been many, but I've seen a few)...this has got to be THE most heartfelt &quot;Kiss off!&quot; I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.<br>
<br>
I think everyone, in their newbie days, sent in one or two &quot;I'm an idiot&quot; petitions because they (I) just didn't understand the rules, yet.  Unfortunately people like you have to deal with them daily and hope they grow up to realize that not every tiny thing that happens is worthy of a petition.  Fortunately, the majority of the EQ population (I think the majority, anyway) does finally realize that the little things just aren't worth the time of petitioning or bothering someone who's time is better-spent on other issues.  Unfortunately, some people never realize this and continue to petition every ten minutes for stupid reasons.  I had those moments in my newbie-ness, and while some may have had the intelligence that I lacked and skipped over that EQ-stage, I grew up, grew out of it, and moved on.  If I must, I'll admit to my previous idiocy however, upon questioning.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I considered guiding, recently, now that I have half a clue...  Upon reading your post and the other former-guides that spoke up after you, however, I think I'll rethink that application.<br>

Tweety, I just applied for a guide position.  =)  I'm still going thru with it.  Your post showed how folks can seethe inside, and still do a good job.  I imagine that the folks on the server on which you guide must really appreciate you.<br>
<br>
I play on The Rathe, and all of the guides that I've dealt with have been polite and helpful.  Even when they have to say no, they try to accompany it with a short explanation.  I can imagine you do that, also.  These guides, and now you, are why I decided to try the program.  <br>

<br>
- Guides, which are EQ customers who volunteer <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (well, 10$ a month because they don't have to pay for their account. And they get EQ expansions for free)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to help other players, *do not* have the ability to repop a zone themselves. <br>
- GMs, which are payed Verant employees, do have the ability to repop a zone. <br>
<br>
There's a major difference between both. A part in Tweety's rant is about losers who can't tell the difference... <p><br>

I knew I was done with customer service when I asked Them to describe what the words &quot;whole&quot; and &quot;half&quot; meant.

What you have done here is make me feel VERY guilty about some of the previous petitions I have made.  Fortunately, I have learned the game, I have learned what I should and should not expect from a guide and I have only sent in two petitions in my last 20 or so levels that I can recall.<br>
<br>
As a member of the Customer Service community in an organization which hires top class, spoiled children from college, I DO understand your frustration.  Sometimes I wonder at the mentality I have to deal with and I ask myself how the hell did our civilization actually progress with some of the absolute MORONS out there.  If there are people out there who can deal with these individuals without getting all knotted up inside on occasion, I would have to say they come from another world, they cannot possiblly be human.  <br>
<br>
I have spent many occasions walking away from my desk repeating every word in your post, if not verbatim, then at least with the same pretense.<br>
<br>
To display that level of emotion would imply you do care, the fact that you have not quit testifies to your dedication to the task and therefore, IMHO, to your inner charcter.  I suspect the harshness of your post should give you about two or three months of inner peace before it is time to release again.  Gratz on doing it in a constructive way as opposed to taking it out on one poor soul who may either be guilty of being a genetic freak(reference to the absolutely hillarious sperm comment) or may just not understand the policies.<br>

That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.<br>
<br>
Let's take my job as an example. I truly like it and I like the people I work with, that doesn't mean that I don't get frustrated every now and then and feel the need to vent off some steam. <br>
<br>
When I feel like ranting, who do I turn to? Friends/family who don't work here, that wouldn't understand exactly what I was going through?  Heck no, I turn to the people on my team who know the frustrations inherent in the job and can offer appropriate commiserations.  Does that mean that I'm not good at my job? Or that I can't handle it? Of course not.<br>
<br>
It just makes sense that Tweety would want to share his rant with those of us that would understand and sympathize with him.  Who hasn't heard the lamer yelling about something stupid (like the guy last night in the Lake who wanted a teleport to Overthere so he could get 30 plat to pay for a teleport to WC, don't ask, but it was funny as hell) or who hasn't been the person who may have sent in a stupid petition? (tox forest: level 6, looted a staff of tracing off a newbie mob.  Came back the next day and it was gone. Petition? You betcha, poor guide who had to explain some mage must have given it to a newbie mob).<br>
<br>
So, in short, I think that the occasional bitch session is healthy and it doesn't mean that Tweety isn't a damn fine guide on some server.  Plus, the rants are just funny as hell.  Does anybody else open the Rants/Flames page and think, &quot;ooooh, another Tweety rant, YAY!&quot;<br>
