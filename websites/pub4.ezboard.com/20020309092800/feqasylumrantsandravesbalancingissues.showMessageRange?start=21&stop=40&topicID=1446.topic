When all the facts are reviewed you will have no case. I wont go any further on the boards. If you want to discuss it in game I or another officer will be more than willing.<br>
And as far as calling us Ass Holes, well to each his own but I can tell you from my perspective your words mean nothing to me.  The Lanys community as a whole usually decides the good from the bad Guilds. Nuff said.<br>
And to any MW members that read this, I would ask you not to respond to this thread. It will be handled. <p><a href="http://www.mithrilweb.com//"target="web"><img src="http://www.mithrilweb.com/images/sigs/Cucsig.jpg" border="0">

<br>
Personally, to me, winning this game is being able to make friends, and play a game with them. Kinda like Sitting down and playing monopoly with your buds...uhh...no nm...<br>
<br>
I love nothing more about this game other than uniting as a family through good shit and bad shit. Bad shit being a CR for one guildee in PoF turning into a 5 corpse CR  and the good being VS which we formed quickly to wipe out and had the required number of people, cleared to just before prep room only to see another &quot;uber&quot; guild stealth by and steal him (/rant off) but the point was, we were there, together, as a family and no one really cared (except our wizzie) that they beat VS, or didn't get loot, we just went to kael and farmed some faction and didn't give it a second thought.

That's not KSing (and I do believe I've heard the word KSing on these boards in reference to whatever happened.)<br>
<br>
I've heard both sides of the story, and I will say this...<br>
<br>
MW is one of the best guilds on the server.  They've always handled everything with honor and respect.  They WOULD never KS someone. <br>
I remember someone telling me the process it takes to get into MW.  You really have to prove yourself and how honorable you are.  Out of all the guilds on the server, there are few that have the reputation MW has.  If I am ever in trouble and TSO cannot help me for some reason (luckily I've never had to be put in that situation /hug TSO), I know I can call on my friends in MW and they will come running. I've had a friend in MW leave his exp group to come summon my corpse (and his group stalked him and followed him to the zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  I've seen MW go and do a fear break to rescue corpses because they were asked.  <br>
Is all of this relevant to what happened at VS (whatever it was)? Not really.  BUt it shows that MW is honorable and that they help more than hurt. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
(This is not a flame on Iris. I have friends in that guild as well. I cannot say anything specific about what happened at VS because I was not there. ) <p><center><img src="http://walkersofthewind.homestead.com/files/Austriana3a.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uasterothchrismatica.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asteroth Chrismatica</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/2/02 4:49:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: . . . </span><hr size=1> /nod Aust<br>
<br>
MW has proven themselves on more than one occasion. That's why no names were mentioned in my first post. As far as the KC incident goes, I take it with a grain of salt. Sometimes the spoils of a bottleneck prove to be greater than other things. Noe dont get me wrong, I wanted to see my wizard get that staff more than anything, but Iris will NEVER EVER EVER do anything to slight another guild. When we had enough people to begin clearing, I even asked if MW would like to join us and get a roll between their wizard and mine. I thought that was a cool thing to do. They declined. So, we moved in. I know the rules of the game. First people to engage it, get it. However, what was done IMO was just a momentary lack of respect. When I decided to form a higher end guild I promised myself I would treat all other guilds no matter how big or how small equally. <br>
<br>
There are going to be people that want to race you to a mob no matter how many people you have there or how much time you've spent camping it. I learned that when I needed Verina Tomb for my epic. Seriously, I should have expected the competition. We weren't fast enough I guess. BUT if I see people in the zone who began a series of event to kill a mob suck as clearing the way to them, you bet im going to respect that. My guild members aren't mad about missing out on loot. They're upset because people sometimes show a tad bit of dishonor. PLEASE UNDERSTAND. This is not a flame against every member of MW, this is just trying to get people to see that sometimes, it may just be cool to give people a whack at something and be a little tactful. No where in my previous posts did I lie about anything. The people who were there from MW didn't KS us. They simply moved passed us while we were clearing to him. There's nothing in the rules that says you cant do that. If there was an infraction of rules, I would have raised hell. Crap, I didn't even petition the GM that contacted me. A bystander in KC reffered him to me and he just asked what happened.  I told him what happened and he took action. Oh well. We'll continue trying and keep our heads high and securely fastened, but if we come across individuals that seem to think they own the place and we get shafted, we're not going to lay down and let them walk on us.<br>
<br>
Thanks Lanys for all your support. As some of you know we go out of our way to help people and haven't ever wronged anyone. Thats how it will stay. If you need the help of a rag tag bunch of kickass peeps, give us a tell. Godspeed. <br>

<br>
That depends on your definition of &quot;getting something done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyhow, Asteroth.  You've irked me for a while but I left it alone until you started attacking my MW friends, and there's little else you can call the jabs you have made at &quot;those dishonorable peeps that ran over your raid in Karnor's.&quot;  I think it's awfully rude of you to say something like that on the forums, even without mentioning them, about a guild that you know will not come here to defend themselves and get involved in possible flame wars.  Fortunately I can come here and defend them without invoking Cuc's wrath. :P<br>
<br>
Let me tell you something else I think is awfully rude, although I only vaguely remember some of the details (perhaps some others can help me fill those in).  I was playing Stelle on a particular hate raid where you came along -- but only conditionally.  You shouted several times that you would only grace us with your presence if &quot;insert condition here&quot; was met (and no, I don't remember what the condition was).  I also remember that the raid got wiped out and went on a nasty CR.  I was not the raid leader and was not put in charge of the CR until about 3 hours later, but there were people working hard on the CR and their every effort went wrong somehow, resulting in frustration for everyone.<br>
<br>
Despite all this, Savil and others kept the mood of all the naked peeps in sro lighthearted and patient, and overall I was very grateful that when Tanise and I finally took over the CR the attitude of the peeps involved was good...with the exception of you.  When I entered sro and waited for a port up to hate for the CR attempt that would eventually be successful, you were shouting line after line of abuse about the people in charge of the raid and the CR, and apparently had been for a while without them even in zone.  I refuted several of your complaints, and finally you were quiet.  You mentioned several times &quot;screwing all of us and getting your guildies (rota at the time) up there to get your corpse and leave.&quot;  Tanise and I asked you to wait until we had broken the camp and it was safe for people to start porting up without training us before bringing anyone up, and that we would prefer if you would just wait your turn like everyone else.<br>
<br>
You ignored us and the original raid leader, and brought your guildies up while we were dealing with several mobs at the camp and when a train would've been devastating (fortunately you weren't aggrod and didn't train us, or I'd be a hell of a lot madder and you would've heard my displeasure long before now).  You had your guildies summon your corpse and then you all ported out while we were still dealing with mobs at the camp and trying desperately to rez anyone who still had time left on his/her corpse.<br>
<br>
So forgive me if I have a hard time believing your claim that the most honorable guild on the server &quot;ran over&quot; your raid.  MW, from having known them a LONG LONG time, would not run over a fly, and I'm sure there are &quot;details&quot; about the event that you are not mentioning here.<br>
<br>
Also note that I have no problem with Iris players and have no experience with the guild whatsoever...I'm only irked at your guildleader's behavior on this occasion and that of the aforementioned hate raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uferok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ferok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/2/02 7:38:25 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ferok.freeservers.com/head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: . . . </span><hr size=1> Ack.

I dont think there was any condition though because I had my epic and didn't want any armor. I was there with a COUPLE other RoA members, (i was in RoA at the time) and this is how the raid went. <br>
<br>
I was asked to come help. That fine, I love to help people out. <br>
<br>
The origional raid leader was Mukhtar who then passed the reigns off to Amoge i think it was.<br>
<br>
After 3 hours of sitting in Sro, Me and the few other Riders that were there, planned a well calculated Rescue at the entrance. <br>
<br>
We ported up, I looted without a rez, then proceded to the NE camp.<br>
<br>
We all did, Me, Winko, Venen i think, Maybe maxxim, I cant remember all of them but anyways...<br>
<br>
Im almost sure I offered to help with the CR. Mind you I was Irked also but I dont recall my attitude being foul. I know there were several Mischief and Mayhem people there who would attest to that. <br>
<br>
Anyways, thats all neither here nor there. Basically I'm being painted as a selfish and malicious person here.  <br>
<br>
No, I didn't buy 40 coffins with my own money to rescue people from Timerous Deep when the Fay raid went bad for Vicex. No I havent lead planes raids for absolutely no reason other than to equip the lanys community and not myself. Yeah, Im a bastard. No I didn't win a bio orb from Iris's CS shindig and then random off my personal Ornate Runed Shield for free to those who didn't wint the orb. Im no saint by any means, but I have gone out of the way for so many people and this is what I get. Bashed. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I've talked at length to MW, Namely Chibb, and we're fine about the whole thing. He understands that there was miscommunication and no malicious intent was there. We're cool now, and we've even invited them on our guild raids and he's offered to help on VS. <br>
<br>
Now, to the rest of the Lanys community that knows me, you know  I am a hothead, however you know that I will do whatever possible to help the people I can. Personally I dont care. Flame me all you want, but those who have been at the recieving end of the things I've done to help people wont forget and thats what matters. In closing, thank you Chibb for sending me a tell tonight and clearing things up. And thanks to the people who support Iris. /shrug, nothing left to say. <br>

Yes, those of you who know me know that I am a friend of Asteroths.  No, I wasn't there.  Yes, even though I'm a friend of Asteroth he's PISSED ME OFF on a few occasions (you should have seen this one time when we were in Sears, and... well nevermind).  I've also seen Asteroth THROW himself into Fear 10 times in a row in an effort to clear a path for a cleric to get in and start ressing people.  But that's not the point.  I don't see why people are getting so angry over this.  If it's cool with the two main leaders of the raid, a little exaggeration on a forum shouldn't be taken so seriously.  Maybe people are tired, maybe people are hungry, whatever your reason for being so hostile, peace love and flower power man.<br>
<br>
Whatever, it's just a shame to see a rift growing over such a small thing.  No matter who you are arguing makes you look bad.  My advice:  Take the high road.  I know very good people in both guilds, and I hate to see them get so torn up over this.<br>

In fact i was refered here by many people to read this.  On the Iris MW raid i did see something of the sort that looked like KS.  I know i cleared the room with iris all the way to VS.  I know that i was setting up harmony to clear his room.  I was not there in this form but as my cleric Bret.  To watch MW do this was shocking to say the least.  did i ask the guild leader, nope.  I just left it be.  From what i saw this is basically non of my buissness i have a lot of other things to worry about as well.  BUt i would like to say to this &quot;flame&quot;  that people should discuss things before engaging a mob.  If the GM did acutally look into this and gave iris the loot, then for the most part there was a miss communication that occured.  It happens.  To say you were KS'ed would be wrong becuase VS was engageed by MW.  on the other hand moving in and not giving a smaller guild that is trying VS a chance is also wrong.  2 wrongs don't make a right.  <br>
<br>
On the other topic at hand, can i ask why it was brought up now?  Why throw old times in.  Im sure everyone has matured for the most part.  I have truely matured myself in this game by learning a lot of people skillz.  <br>
<br>
all i want to say is that though maybe there were 2 wrongs in this situations, maybe we should let these 2 guilds work it out and lock this forum  so that they can handle there disputes without causing any reputation loss to anyone in lanys.<br>

 I will not start any more flaming on these boards over this VS incident, anyone wants to know more about it will have to do it through tells. I will say though, that MW did not KS anyone, or try to trample over people. There was no GM involved in anything to do with giving any loot to anyone. MW went and killed VS fair and square. I could post the whole incident, but I don't see where that will do any good for certain people, therefor I won't. Letting this die now I hope. Thanks .<br>

<br>
Yeah, I do seem to remember you might've been at the camp after the break.  After we told you repeatedly do NOT port up and come to the camp, because you might train us and wipe us out for the 4th or 5th time.  I also remember that when we needed you for clarity and CC later, you were not there anymore, so you must've gated or ported out at some point.<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure that you didn't offer to help with the CR, to me at least, but if you had we would've told you please no, we wanted to keep the force porting up there as small and tight as possible, as we did tell you when you mentioned you might be bringing guildies up just to get your corpse(s).  And yes you were quite rude in shout in sro, you were the only one criticizing the way the raid and CR was being run while everyone else was trying to be positive and patient. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I do appreciate your being calm and mature about it though.  Unfortunately that doesn't change what happened, and neither does all the good deeds in the world. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Please show me where the flames are, because I don't see them.  Arguments, discussions, even allegations are NOT flames -- if you need a lesson in what a flame is, please see Nalgene and he will be happy to instruct you. :P  I actually think this has been a pretty good model of a mature way to handle matters such as this, as opposed to a flamewar, but then again most any incident with MW is handled this way.<br>

This issue did not warrant its own thread, but it did warrant remembering, and has been remembered by most everyone on that raid (and it wasn't as long ago as I made it seem, my memory is just that bad).  I found it relevant because Asteroth accused a very honorable guild of a very dishonorable thing, when his history has been none too perfect itself.  And from what has been &quot;concluded,&quot; it seems that his accusations were pretty baseless, a misunderstanding I'm sure.  I just wish he had found that out before he made the accusations in the first place.  I would have kept the incident tucked away in my memory had Asteroth not attacked my good friends the honorable MW. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujugernaught.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jugernaught</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/3/02 1:32:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: . . . </span><hr size=1> I hear ya adjani.  Asteroth you should not attack anyone and you have learned a valuable lesson on the lanys boards.

Iris was there first clearing the mobs, and MW came past and took the mob..., that was clearly bad judgement on MW.. regardless or the guilds trackrecord and honorablity..   <br>
If these individuals who happened to be apart of MW, did this, then it doesn't matter that they are apart of a guild with a virtually spotless record.  It happened, it happened.. admit it, say you're sorry and lets move on.  And since MW is a guild with such honorablitly, i think they would be first to apologize.  <br>
<br>
ex.  if some newbies are clearing out the mobs at orc1.. and they have 3 left to go..  and some lv 50 comes in and kills off the last three to get belts for his twinks..    i say bad judgement and /rude  to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think we already established  that it wasn't a KS, but if it happened the way i understand, appears to be a bit rude.<br>

VS is done 90% guildinternal these days.  If you come there with a capable force. you get in and get it done..  .... and if you can't even get in?????.. hello?? <br>
