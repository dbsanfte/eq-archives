At the creation of MF 1 raid mob = 1 point, mobs have changed in value since Luclin, but the idea is still there.<br>
<br>
Comparing randoming/allocation to points IMO was a no brainer. In MS we did officer distribution, you would get flooded with tells on some items and the officers would get accused of colusion and other things.  I remember when MS did Vulak for the first time, we'd get something like 40 tells for each item.  Now compare that to when MF did Vulak one time and you have people throwing out some 100+ points for his stuff.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is when players have to spend hard earned points for a item, they are a lot more selective on what they go for, which IMO was a good thing. <p>

Points are ok but Man I have a full time job in addition to helping run a guild. I dont need another one.<br>
<br>
Random?? No way hate seeing Wizard # 5 who plays 1 time in a blue moon get the robe of almighty asswhupping instead of the other full time folks.<br>
<br>
So I would say a jury of impartial people. How are they impartial? The guild votes for them of course. If you dont like the way loot is going, change your officer votes. On most raids we have 5 to 9 opinions in that officer chat Majority wins and the only complaint so far guildremoved. and he had more loot allotted to him than anyone. so go figure. People need to be patient, people need to be mature. But this way does work.<br>

Personally, I am glad our guild has an objective decider. I have asked for things I thought were great at the time of drop and lost, but then log on the next day and ask myself why did I even ask. If you put someone with an understanding of the game, and some common sense, you are fine. They balance the loot among the guild, and allow for a more overall better raid experience.<br>
<br>
Also, we only have 1 active main ranger, and he is pretty decently equipped.

<br>
For some guilds, it works fine.  For others, it doesn't.  Plain and simple.<br>
<br>
Personally I'm of the opinion that a point system fosters two ideas.  First, that loot is more important than having fun.  Second, that you are more important than someone else because you can attend more raids.<br>
<br>
Items should be distributed to classes who need the stats on the item the most, according to what they do for the guild.<br>
<br>
A good example is a bard by the name of Kinuvan on Ayonae Ro.  Now, I have no doubt that everyone in their guild is quite well equipped, however I will use Kinuvan as an example.  This bard is so well equipped, he's able to hold taunt on and successfully tank the avatar of war for a fairly decent period of time.  Now, as long as you can hold taunt, that wouldn't be so hard ... so long as you have the ac, and hp for it.  Believe me, he does.<br>
<br>
For their guild, the point system works.  Everyone is well equipped, he just happens to be almost as well equipped if not as well equipped as some of their best warriors.  If that's how they want to play, great.  Their guild does a lot of amazing things (currently in Vex Thal right now)<br>
<br>
For my guild, we're still ramping up to doing stuff like NToV.  We need to improve our tanks ac &amp; hp gear.  We need to increase our monks HP &amp; if possible AC gear.  Our clerics need better +mana, our wizards need dragonbane and giantbane (I think we have one copy of each in guild).<br>
<br>
A point system at this point would screw us up, and make it take longer for us to ramp up.  Random_guildie01 who does a great job for us doing random_task01 would probably want a plate breastplate from hall of testing.  Well, if you consider loot a 'reward', instead of having fun being the reward, then that's fine ... except that if we have a warrior missing a breastplate, and we have that bp to a bard ... who doesn't tank?  That's a waste ... but on the point system, we wouldn't be able to distribute it someplace that it would do the guild more good.<br>
<br>
The other night we went after the Va`Dyn.  It was a load of fun.  I don't think *anyone* complained, everyone had a blast, we nearly wiped like 5 times throughout the whole fight, and one person even asked if we should evac.  We hung in there, though, and triumphed.  In the end, an amulet with some good HP stats was assigned to one of our monks.  Why?  He pulls for us.  He needed it.<br>
<br>
We also had a toetwister drop.  Two bards were there, but it was assigned to one of them.  Why though?  Well, the one that got it was level 54.  Giving him a weapon that much better than his previous weapon (epic and I think di`zok wristsnapper) would potentially help him in experience groups, which helps him level faster ... whereas the other bard is level 60 and didn't really need it all that much.<br>
<br>
I prefer handing out items based on need and what'll help the guild the most.  It only works, however, when the person in charge has a fair hand.  Koryo is a great example of someone who is very fair at this.  Anytime I've discussed loot policies with people in magister (they do the assigned loot thing, or at least used to anyway), everyone always commented on how fair Koryo was with dealing out loot.<br>
<br>
It obviously works for Magister, and they are if not our top guild, right up there.<br>

It gives each person the power to go after items they really want, rather than letting someone &quot;assign&quot; what items they think you should have. It's parallel to having your mom choose your clothes and dress you. A lot of folks prefer to have a little more say over what they do and do not gain. <br>
<br>
They key to any system, tho, is that it continues to make the game fun for the player. If the player doesn't have fun in a guild which has officer loot assignment, then another guild might be for that player if loot is that important. <br>
<br>
While loot for myself may not be that important, I have absolutely zero fun watching other players (some whom I would call friends) getting 'screwed' out of something.<br>
<br>
But it boils down to pretty simple terms:<br>
<br>
Officer Assigned : The &quot;power&quot;, and responsibility, is in the hands of one person, or a small group of individuals.<br>
<br>
Points System : The &quot;power&quot;, and responsibility, is in the hands of each and every member of the guild.<br>
<br>
Random System : The &quot;power&quot; is in the luck of the die.<br>
<br>
None of the systems are perfect for every player, but many of the systems are indeed perfect for specific guilds. <br>

<br>
I've seen some of you talk about items going to classes who may need it less than others....but lets use this as an example<br>
<br>
A plate BP drops in ToV<br>
<br>
A warrior who attends 25% of raids wants in on it<br>
A SK who attends 75% of raids wants in on it<br>
<br>
The SK has the most points and wins the BP<br>
<br>
Now, some of you say that the warrior would get the most benefit from it..I disagree....since he only attends 25% of raids his value to the guild is considerably less than the SK who attends 75%.<br>
<br>
Therefore the SK winning the BP benefits the guild, as he will be contributing more to the success of the guild as a whole<br>
<br>
In our guild if they 2 were within 5 points of each other then the BP would be randomed between the two of them.  This works well for us and has been our system for quite sometime.  We're at a point in our guild cycle that loot is starting to &quot;trickle&quot; down to our newer members and so far we seem to be very happy with how our system works <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48001>Zelious Duskstalker</a> <br>

<br>
''Bottom line is when players have to spend hard earned points for a item, they are a lot more selective on what they go for, which IMO was a good thing.''<br>
<br>
<br>
That really is a good point and one of the stengths of a points system because no way youre going to blow some points on a so so item if you are saving for your dream one.<br>
<br>
The downside to the points/bid system is that people will (and do) artificially inflate bids on things they know others want simply to lessen that persons points if that person is in competition for ''their type'' of loot (eg plate classes, int casters etc).  <br>
<br>
Example Joe has 190 points and Fred has 150, Joe bids 30 points on some nice item that is a small upgrade for him but wants to make sure he has more than Fred in case uber item X drops, now Fred knows this and so he bids 40 points knowing that Joe will raise his bid (ok he's gambling but people tend to know what other people want) and Joe then bids 50 and wins the item.  Now Joe has 140 and Fred has 150 and Fred knows he can win the bid if the item he wants drops.<br>
<br>
I know some of you may say that such a situation would not happen in your guild....well ok for you that think that i applaud your 100% total non rivalry, complete team effort.  for the rest of the guilds that are normal and do have people in them who have the normal human failings then this happens a lot, sometimes just a small upping of a few points here and there over the course of a few raids and some guy wipes 100 points off all his rivals.<br>
<br>
Its nasty, unfair and not good but a points system is open to that type of abuse.  Another problem with it is that people can conspire to artificially fix the bids on class restricted items.  <br>
<br>
Lets say 3 rogues want a rog only dagger but dotn want to get into a biddign war over it because then they have less points left for the all/all or multiclass stuff, well they simply agree that Joe gets it first for a bid of 25 and then Fred for 25 and then Sam for 25.  On an item they would have bid maybe 75 on.<br>
<br>
You might ask what harm this does?  well it actually harms everyone else who has to bid fairly in non-fixed bidding for their items, while these guys fix their prices low so they can afford more on other stuff.<br>
<br>
A points system is open to both those types of abuse and they are very hard to spot or prove<br>
<br>
<br>
As for officers makign all the calls...well if you were in a guild 3 years ago and grew up with those people (a bit like the old Da'Kor) then yes, i can see that this could work because everyone would know and have complete faith in the guild structure and everyone would know who wanted, needed and deserved what.  But otherwise a lot of people are simply not goign to have the trust required for this, and some decisions are bound to look like favouritism even when they may not be.<br>
Also some decisions MAY be favouritism whereby someone can justify their call but deep down they actually decided that way to fvck over Joe Bloggs for some imagined slight 6 months ago.<br>
<br>
I know magister use this system and it seems to work well for them, but for most guilds its going to cause problems at some time or another, especially with new people who do not have the trust and faith in the loot pickers that the old members may have.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sure there is no one perfect system and they all will have some loophole or another along the way.  As an ex guild leader I and the officers spent a lot of time examinign this issue (as i am sure lots of people do) and the system i came up with is still, to this day IMHO the fairest way to distribute loot while rewardiNG attendance but having no randoms and never puttiNG one peRson in competition with another.  <br>
<br>
I am sure some would disagree, such is EQ.<br>

<br>
   Okay, the system has worked fine for 6 months with your new guild &quot;the ubbers&quot;. A epic haste War only belt with +85% haste has dropped off a God-mob. You have six warriors present. The one with the most points hasn't played in two months prior to this raid. He wins the belt, and you don't see him for another month. Best thing for the guild? Probably not. So you reset the system to 0 points for everyone, and a few of your veteran clerics disband from the guild. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  -Mec <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umoongaden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moongaden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/7/02 3:17:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10267.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply</span><hr size=1> Mitch:There's no reason why the people bidding cant be kept anonymous,  therefore making your examples nearly impossible to establish. <p><img src=http://Moongaden.homestead.com/files/Sig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2005<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/7/02 3:17:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10267.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply</span><hr size=1> I have to agree that I've seen plenty of complaints for each and every system. Each guild has to choose the one that is best for them.<br>
<br>
Early on in a guilds career allocation seems to work best. Lets use Zelious's example that SK raids more then Warrior and as such wins the breastplate and legs that the warrior needs. When you have very few well equipped warriors you're not going to get very far.<br>
<br>
But then there will always be accusations of unfair loot distribution.<br>
<br>
Then you have the points system which can be a nightmare to administrate. The other thing is that I don't agree that whoever plays most benefits the guild. Whether we like it or not there are certain classes that are more needed on raids then others and I accept that I am one of the lesser needed classes. It is important that we equip those needed classes better. It's just the way it is.<br>
<br>
And then you have the person that raids an awful lot, never spends his points so he can save up hundreds to completely dominate every really uber item.<br>
<br>
Personally my favourite choice is the point/random combination.<br>
<br>
If a person has 8 points and another has 3 points they both choose how many points they want to bid. Then they roll that many times 1-100. Winner takes the item and loses the amount of points they bid.<br>

I should have worded it more clearly to say that the part I was using as an example was the SK who raids more then the warrior.<br>
<br>
But your question bears answering anyway. My answer is that it's going to differ in each case. I understand what you're saying but what if the SK your talking about is one of 6 SK's whilst the warrior is one of only 2. Your 6th SK is never going to be as important to raids as your second warrior etc.<br>
<br>
The other thing I dislike about point systems is that some people seem to think that it means people will participate more and I have never found that to be the case. I find people who are constantly losing out to players who can play more just stop bothering.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing that points systems dont work but Ysall asked why doesn't everyone use a points system and Im offering ideas why. It obviously works for CE and that's great. <br>
