The problem is of a healing process.  You look at the majority of wars that has happened in US history--England is now an ally, Japan is now an ally, Germany is now an ally, southern US is now an ally.  How does this happen?  Not holding the general population of a state responsible for the actions of the idiot that started it.  I am a Gulf War Vet, and do you think that I beleive that all Iraqi people are bad, and must die?  No.  It is bad leadership and if you oppose the views of that bad leadership you die.<br><br>I am so happy I can tell the truth and not die from it.  Bill Clinton was a draft dodging, dope smoking, womanizer that should have never been supported by the Democratic Party, let alone elected to President.  Hehe, I said it and the governmaent can't kill me (if I come up missing I was wrong about this).<br><br>When a religious sect (or political group) states that because the people don't agree with us they must die, they themselves become evil.  It is not the purpose of any religion (or political group) to kill the &quot;evil&quot; enemy.  The purpose is to convert them.  If you are truely better than your opponent then there is no need to kill them.  That is why I do not understand the philosphy behind Jihad.  You are not islamic, I am not superior enough to convert you, so you must die?  What kind of philosophy is that?<br><br>When a population that is evil is out to kill you and you therefore decide that the whole population of a country (or ethnic group) must die you yourself become evil.  <br>In northern Ireland the Protestants and Catholics are killing each other because the other side isn't interpreting &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;  correctly.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, the US is not perfect.  We are by the the only country in the world that has used nuclear weapons in war time (or peace time for that matter) against people.  We also have used chemical weapons in Viet Nam against deserters.  We subjected our own people to radiation to study the effects.  We learned this is a mistake, and grew from it--at least as far as I know. <p>Clerman Healmore <BR>Lvl 56 cleric <BR>Forgotten Guard</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhoppkins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hoppkins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/26/02 2:18:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Politics of war</span><hr size=1> yah well every country has skeletons in the closet.

Your god is the utmost moral authority and if you second guess him then you may go to hell or be eternaly punished.  So it doesn't matter what the logical or just thing is.  If you are a true believer, you must follow your religion or it means nothing.  This is the essense of dogma.<br><br>What is the best way around all of this?  Give them all free cable and some televisions.  Have it set to ESPN, Lifetime, CNN, and talk shows.  After they have dealt with &quot;Lesbian Midget Wedding Scandals&quot; from Springer and had a good cry with Oprah, then they be more ready to accept the US.

The balance of powers make it so, and the common value of freedom will always enable the press to sell stories of corruption which in turn creates an even battle ground where institutions can fight a mostly even battle.  Freedom and capitalism really work well together.  <br><br>  Not being afraid of the truth allows our culture to advance faster than others.  We don't get too flustered when the president cigar-fuks his White-House-Ho only to spooch all over her pretty party dress and smoke off his big-O at the party.  Could you imagine the chaos in Saudi Arabia if the media printed such things about their king(or whatever the fuk he is)  I have to admit, I was proud to be American when all that got out to the media.  Because every country in the world was laughing at us.  They didn't realize how obvious it was that by them paying so much attention to us, they were at the same time recognizing our superiority.

Those unknown reasons actually have been suggested to be that he was in alcohol, and some say drug, rehab at the time.  Substantial accounts and evidance point towards George having done hard drugs, look it up.  We know he became a recovering alcoholic at age 40 (actually believe it was 38 but I'm not looking it up while at school, do it yourself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  When Clinton dodged the draft he was on a scollership to a very promanent school...when Bush did it he was trying to kick the boos.<br>Want to know an interesting little bit about draft-dodgers?  Most every prominant politician, currently, got out of the draft one way or another.  Cheney stayed in school until his 27th birthday and right after that he stopped taking classes.  Strange that the oldest a person could be drafted at was 26.  In fact out of the &quot;big players&quot; the only one who can say they were actually in Vietnam at the time of the war is...Al Gore.  He didn't see combat, granted, but it takes 6-7 people to support one combat troop anyway so most Nam Vets didn't see combat.<br>Now, before you praze Bush for his record and his life why not do some sniffing around in his dirty laundry...the vastly Republican OWNED (as the majority of actors/writers are Democrats) media certainly isn't going to do it for you. <p><center>"Living with you is like living in a living nightmare!" -Space Ghost<color></center><center><IMG SRC="http://www.gwbush.com/store/images/didntcount.gif"ALIGN=TOP></center><center><a href="http://gwbush.com/gwtv/limits_to_freedom.mp3">"There Ought to be Limits to Freedom!" - George W.
