<br>
OK - If Dracoliche is up - you as a puller have probably seen him marching around the graveyard with his pet.  Dracoliche might look like a bone dragon - but it is NOT undead - and you can not use undead DD against him.  It does see through invis and will aggro you and chase you.  I will talk more about Dracho later.<br>
<br>
Please inform everyone - especially your chanters that pulls will be coming from the south.  You will now be pulling around the south of portal hill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    South and Heading East</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
You have the south patrol - that moves - East to West and ends up in the SW corner (which could have been taken during the break - or during an early pull).  There is a MoB that walks up the back side of the hil in an angle that is usually an Amy or a Fetid Fiend.  Can be an ape - but that is more rare - as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  most</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Apes are West Wall only.  There is usually 1 - 2 mobs that walk down into the SW corner.  Once again - Amy and Fetids for the most part.  As you are clearing the SW corner and around portal hill - there is a chance of pulling maybe a toad or a WW from the SW corner of the GY.  Make sure to just look around and aggro all the little stuff between the hill and the tower first to prevent cross pulls.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Yellow Tower</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  A.K.A. Scare tower - since usually there are 4-5 mobs inside - mainly scares ... (usually looks like 4 scares and maybe a WW or Fetid maybe even a frightfinger).  NOTE - this applies for most landmark - building pulls - YOU WILL GET THEM ALL (unless level truly has something to do with it).  Now is a good time for a peeler - but then again ... if your raid has 3 chanters - they are probably bored right now.  Gague your chanters and what they can and can not handle - the fact is - IF YOU HAVE BROKE - you are in pretty decent hands - IF SOMEONE BAILED YOU OUT, but the raid is continuing - you might want to consider smaller pulls.  For the love of God - have SoW up - cause these Scares - as noted before - will fly faster than Jboots - and eat through your Rune - and start hitting you - and with your back to them - you very well could get backstabbed a couple times for 440 and or ported. (Which can be a very bad thing - though on occasion it has saved my life as well ... as I was ported in the right direction and able to FD - but why risk it)<br>
<br>
Clear up any roamers between here and the Boogey House - as that will be your next pull.  This means snagging some stuff from the GY between the portal and the Boogey House ... be mindful young bedouin ... of your distance next to the house when pulling things ... as the aggro is huge.  Note - you might have to do several pulls on this one and clean up some of the south GY.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Boogeyman House</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  Once again 4-5 mobs ... Mainly Boogeys ... maybe a Fetid - Sammy - or even a fright finger.  Same drill ... by now you should be getting the hang of it - or if you are a pro ... you are getting 'very sleepy' at reading me type this over and over.<br>
<br>
After Boogeys are pulled ... clear up any random mobs between boogey house/yellow tower and the WW Tower.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  WW Tower</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  (Dang it - there are more Sammies here than WW)  Nother house pull.  Mainly Samhians - usually 2 - and then about 2 frightfingers - maybe a boogey or a WW or 2 - ... 4-5 mobs total.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Dracoliche</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  IF</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Draco is up - then continue reading (well - yes - you can read anyways) - if NOT - then you may skip to the Graveyard section.<br>
<br>
At this time ... from the south - circle around the hill and begind pulling the onsies twosies ... making a path to Draco.  Note - you can practicly pull the whole GY as Draco roams North to South and East to West ... but once enough of the GY is pulled - and you are ready for Draco - tell everyone to get ready.<br>
<br>
Dracho is like a normal prekunark dragon fight.  Debuff and get 4 fakes up (please no water breathing from high lvl peeps as DMF will proabably be applied later and things like that keep it from sticking)  Fakes ... can be Ultravision - Resist Fire - Resist Cold - and something else - I think Kinsleyer had cast See Invis (which DMF does) but he was lower level and my DMF stuck.  Make sure Resist Disease and Resist Magic are LAST.<br>
<br>
NOTE - Dracholiche's main attack is Disease Based.  I did not see a poison one go off the one time I did fight it - but it is a Necro type mob - has a pet - and I would assume a poison based DoT.  The whole time I was pulling it - it was trying to Shock of Poison it looked like - which is a DD poison attack and I kept resisting Scourge (39 Necro Spell) . It kinda casts like Cynderella (sp) outside Fear portal (I mean the same types of spells she tries to do)<br>
<br>
Scourge<br>
Adding 4 Disease counters<br>
DoT for 504 Hit Points (HP) in 21 ticks<br>
Decrease Current Hitpoints by 40 (L34)<br>
<br>
I have heard that his AoE is the Following - though I didn't get it stuck on me ...<br>
<br>
Rotting Flesh<br>
Adding 9 Disease counters<br>
DoT for 800 Hit Points (HP) in 8 ticks<br>
Increase Current Hitpoints by 100 (L1)<br>
<br>
It does have the AoE Fear - so make sure walk is on.<br>
<br>
Straight up pre-kunark dragon fight.  One thing about when to do what - Pimm suggested a 100% pets and melee - and at 75% casters - which isn't along the lines of a Naggy fight - and it worked swell.  You have to be in Melee range to cast - and it IS NOT UNDEAD.  So if you are a Necro - not twitching - you gotta be siphoning.<br>
<br>
One other thing to note is this (ONLY APPLIES IF CT IS UP ALSO) ... you have a limited ammount of time once the first person is DTed.  You see - Draco - and the Demis - Dread, Terror, and Fright - are PETS of CT.  When you aggro it - not so much by it getting you on it's hate list - but the first tank to HIT it will be DTed by CT.  DTs will continue every 45 seconds.  On top of that - the Demis - with their Amy Kights ... will begin their journey towards you - bringing other friends as they come.  YOU GOTTA BE SERIOUS AND TAKE DRACO FAST.  If not - you will get jumped and it will be nasty.<br>
<br>
So having loot prerolled is a good thing - though items like the Bone Clasp Girdle and Stasff of Undead Leagions are tradable.  Have the Group leader - or someone that is left in the group - loot the tradable items - and camp to chat after it is dead.  In fact as soon as the battle is over - have your designated monk - sk - necro - FD and make sure everyoen camps or is killed and that camp is clear before they /q and get peeps outa chat.<br>
<br>
OK - so you are ready to pull it.  NOTE - it does see through invis.  So go around the south and up into the GY and find him.  Make sure no mobs are around (which you should have cleared enough that you can grab it).  Get close and it will aggro and chase you ... casting it's spells ... milk it in and around and walla - Dragon Fight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  For each of the Demis - you will be camping to chat as well IF CT is up.  Same drill for each one.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  The Graveyard</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  Now - you can pick and clean out the mobs here before you get Dracho ... but you generally will have some mobs left and will be cleaning them up.  Let me define the Graveyard.  It is everything NORTH of the Boogeyhouse to the Amytemple (firewall) and Everything EAST of the TT Bridge to the Gorgon Roost.<br>
<br>
This is easy - especially cause you will be pulling it south ... and wont have as bad pathing as if you were pulling around the bridges - but RESPECT the graveyard.  The pathing is not uber good - and you can have path backs - and adds cause of it ... it is about milking ... and getting certain landscape features that you know path well for mobs to pull through or around.  Onsies - Twosies.  Note - you don't have to pull all the way to the Gorg Roost ... you will be getting that from the next camp.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  South East Corner</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  At this point you can let everyone know you are going to be moving soon.  Tell them to be patient as the next couple pulls will be long ... BUT if you wanted to just move them - the fight will look something like the break ... with multiple adds and is risky imo - but if you are bored and up for a little excitement you can move them a hair bit early and fight along the way.<br>
<br>
Past the WW tower ... is the SE corner - and what you will pull here is the EAST PATROL.  That is - the mobs that Roam the East wall - North to South patterns.  Includes ... Gorgons - Boogeymen - Frightfingers - Glare Lords - and maybe a WW or 2.  Pull em in - and continue to check out the area - making sure that it is safe to move people.  You should only have about 6-7 pulls before you move.  Loc of new camp is approx n1200 n800.  Clear the way - and move the people there.  Make sure they follow you and stay along the south wall.  The camp looks like a clearing that is flat with 2 trees spaced apart on teh south wall heading east to west - and a large tree just before a small dip. (Like that is really going to help).<br>
<br>
Now you are ready to pull the Demis - the Frightfinger House - the Gorgon Roost ... I will cover that in my next installment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Note - I am about to tear down my system - and I am packing up the last of my stuff ... will be a couple days I think before I can type some more on this subject - but at this point you have cleared most of the plane ... and you get the picture.  The temple is really the only tricky thing - and something Necros do best.  More to come later</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
