Here is the poem I made up  (that I was gonna show and couldn't find)<br>
<br>
Dear %$&amp;*@!,<br>
<br>
This comes from my heart,<br>
With love and thought.<br>
Like a fine work of art,<br>
It can never be taught.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
It all came as a surprise,<br>
Although a welcomed one.<br>
Imagine the look in my eyes,<br>
When it hit me like a ton.<br>
<br>
I found out from a little bird,<br>
About these feeling that were right.<br>
I am glad that they occurred,<br>
So what are you doing Saturday night?<br>
<br>

YA KNOW WHAT I GOT IT THROWN BACK IN MY FACE....<br>
<br>
Screw all the girls who say they'd love a guy like me.... yet they never even make a step towards me... I have to listen to their whining/crying and act like I care... otherwise I am bastard.  Yet all the bastards have girlfriends that love them dearly.... those same girlfriends are always crying whining to the better guys...<br>
<br>
<br>
YET IT NEVER OCCURS TO THEM.. 'HEY WHY NOT ASK THE NICE GUY OUT'<br>
<br>
PS- I'm pretty decent looking and I'm fit... WTF is up with girls.  I go anywhere else I have girls hitting on me.

<br>
The question you may want to ask yourself is not &quot;what is up when THEM&quot; but perhaps &quot;what is up with me&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm not at *all* trying to be mean, but it may have to do with the same reasons that people on the boards have gotten irratated with some of your posts. You've posted quite a few threads with the admitted sole purpose of getting attention. <br>
<br>
Something to think about maybe. Best of luck. <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

<br>
if the people that know you don't ask you out, but the people that don't do... it attests to your personality.  it might have a lot to do with the fact that you seem to be very attention-grabbing, and one of those 'i expect' people.<br>
<br>
i can't speak for all girls, but the ones i know love confidence, but hate false modesty.  they love bravado, but hate a sense of entitlement.  and nothing, repeat nothing, is more ugly than desperation.<br>
<br>
i don't know what it is in your case Owens, but honestly, it's something.  when people that don't know you approach you, but those that do won't... you are most likely giving off some kind of eeby jeeby vibe that girls don't dig.<br>

All the girls you know and won't date you  have horrible self esteem and don't think they deserve better.....but I'm with the others on this one.  <br>
<br>
And nothing really bugs me more then people &quot;trying&quot; to be nice; I always get the vibe that they are trying to get something from me and if I don't give it to them they'll turn nasty on me.  I much prefer people who are just nice, decent human beings, that know themselves and are happy with who and what they are.  Maybe that's a tiny part of your problem?  Are you truly happy and satisfied with you?  Or do you think, &quot;If I could date HER, I'd be so much better off!&quot;  I haven't got a clue if that's anywhere near your situation, but I see it constantly from my students both young men and young women.<br>
<br>
-mirr.<br>
<br>
PS- the poem is nice but the last lines really detract from it. Me being me, would have read that as a half hearted attempt at being the nice guy just to get a date....but that's me.  Poetry is tricky and it's impossible to gauge your audience's reaction.....I spent four years studying it at University and am still clueless about it.<br>

At the risk of sounding like an after school special, your best bet is probably to just be yourself, grow mature and develop a relationship with a friend that turns in to romance.  Maybe not now.  Heck, you are still in school.  Live life.  Sure, some people have significant others.  heck maybe you will find a girl that you find significant and maybe the 2 of you will attempt a relationship.  Some people claim to fall in love on the first shot.  Most don't fall in love until after they have fallen in love several times before <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Relationships and developing into someone that can be in a relationship require time and people.  Take your time, there is no rush.  When you do find someone that you can build a relationship with (even just a passing ships in the night type) it can be a wonderful thing.  <br>
<br>
Don't look for love.  Learn how to love.  <br>
<br>

Women seem to like jerks.  If you're nice to a woman, it's like it's a sign of weakness or something.  You can be confident, charming, and if you act like you'd welcome her attention -- you don't get it.  If you're an asshole and act like you don't care whether she lives or dies, she's intrigued and pursues you.  When it turns out the guy really doesn't care whether she lives or dies, they're heartbroken and they come cry on your shoulder -- but just your shoulder.<br>

Then they yell and scream at the first person who stands up to them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Girls in my class asks &quot;What does chivalry mean?&quot;<br>
I go &quot;Your a junior in highschool and you don't know the meaning of chivalry?&quot;<br>
<br>
She blows up at me.... &quot;Maybe if you were nicer to people, they would be nicer back&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh so the fact that she's an idiot and ignores me/ doesn't count.<br>
<br>
<br>
Only girl I can think of that thinks (exactly really scary) like me.  Doesn't realize maybe we should go out.<br>
<br>
ie  she wants to go out with a non jerk guy<br>
she likes to dance<br>
she likes the idea of romance / poems<br>
ie even on the ideal date thing we did we were both in eachother's 90 % mark<br>
<br>
<br>
I think she just thinks I am not hot enough or just I have a bad stigma with her friends... or just hasn't considered it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS- yeah if you act like a jerk you attract girls, one girl made a joke about me and I told her where she could shove it.( was joking) and she hugged my arm and apologized (thought she was joking and I eventually accepted)<br>

seriously, owens... just work on maturing a bit, the girls will do the same (sooner heehee), and all will be right with the world.<br>
<br>
some girls like jerks<br>
some girls like the guys with the edge<br>
some girls like the quiet ones<br>
some girls like the pretty ones<br>
some girls like the funny ones<br>
<br>
you gotta find the right girl who will like you... and though it's been known to happen, i doubt it will happen in high school ;D<br>

Most people get out of highschool and realize pretty damn quick that what they thought was popular, and what they thought was unpopular makes little to no differance in the real world. <br>
<br>
In the real world most girls (woman) want a guy who is sucessful more then one that is good looking. <br>
Most want one that can support a family more then one that can benchpress 300 pounds.<br>
<br>
I actually went to a high school reunioun of sorts and all the girls that were too uppity for me in highschool were all interested in me when I explained what I do for a job, and how bright my future looks. <br>
I had a good time snubbing them. <br>
Bwaaah hahaha<br>
Not to mention I had a good tme laughing at all the girls that were 'too good' for me in highschool who now had STDs or were pregnant without fathers or still living at home<br>
Bwaaah hahaha<br>

<br>
stop being nervous... too many people put all their eggs in one basket and say... SHE is the one for me!<br>
<br>
well let me tell ya... when you ask someone out.. there are only two outcomes really... either we say yes or we say no.<br>
<br>
You cant really control either... so dont sweat it.  Just be yourself, have fun and dont worry what anyone thinks of you.<br>
<br>
<br>
ok Xian.. now we are even... I just asked a teenager to break the entire paradigm of highschool!<br>

<br>
HEY! I had plenty of patience in high school. I never actively went out looking for girls. They just came to me at their own rate. Here's my advice (again):<br>
<br>
Forget about 'em. Get a hobby or something. Play more EQ, hang out with friends, do something other than worry about members of the opposite sex. Heck if you're under 18 and have no college ambition go out and start skating or a band or something. Just don't worry about it, if these sl00ts had any sense they would come after you instead. To reiterate:<br>
<br>
1) forget about it<br>
<br>
2) find something else to keep you occupied<br>
<br>
3) girls and some women are the devil. If you need some examples look up these people:<br>
<br>
Barbara Streisand<br>
Kathy Lee Gifford<br>
Rosie O'Donnel<br>
Oprah<br>
Sally Jessy Raphael<br>
