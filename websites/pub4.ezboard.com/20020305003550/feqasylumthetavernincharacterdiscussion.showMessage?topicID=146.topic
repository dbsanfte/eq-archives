My Partner Phread was out barshing brownies for chocolate cookies while I tended shop.  I liked the time alone.  Gave me a chance to collect my thoughts.  At times I would just let my thoughts go and just let the sound of the ceiling fan's subtle woosh be my only thought.<br><br>And then she walked in.  She was leggy dark elf woman and that meant one thing; trouble.  She flashed them baby blues (her eyes that is) at me and with a practiced hopelessness in her voice she started her swan song.  I asked her for her name and she said that would come in time.  All she wanted to do was hire me to track down a staff for her.  She showed me a picture of it.  It looked pretty neat.  She said it supposedly came from some frogs on Kunark.  &quot;Lady, I've seen a lot of frogs in Kunark.  Freekin continent is lousing with them and lizards.  You wanna tray and narrow it down for me?&quot; She said that was all she knew and that she was paying well.  She set a large bag of plat on the table.  &quot;Is that all you got?&quot; I inquired.  She then cracked a mischievous grin on her face and crossed over to my side of the desk.  Perching her baby blues (not her eyes this time) on the corner of my desk she positioned herself in susch a way to show me more of her gams.  More than just my interest perked up at this.  And just as things were about to get interesting, my partner showed up.<br><br>&quot;Howdeez Blade! Me gots bunches brownie parts fer kookies&quot; he beamingly said.  Startled, the dark elf woman covered herself up.  She then asked me if I would take the case.  Hey, I'd been to the Maiden's Fancy before and I have seen some pretty neat things in my time, but well umm... &quot;Yes, we are on the case.&quot;  With that, she left me with a crystal gem she said could be used to contact her.  She left.<br><br>&quot;Who wuz dat? She am smell like kookies.&quot;  my partner inquired.  &quot;That's are next meal ticket&quot; I told him. &quot;When dems start makin uz use meel tikuts?  Dat am new wun on Phread.  Am dems 'spensive?&quot;  I need to be careful when I use similes and metaphors around my partner.  Anyway, after spending 3 and a half hours explaining to Phread that we won't need to spend money on meal tickets and that even if there were meal tickets, being a meal ticket taker would not necessarily be a good job because even if they were in existence that they might not get an employee discount. we headed out.<br><br>We needed to check our usual sources.  When it came to rare goods there was one stop that needed to be made; Maldan.  I'd swear that man never leaves the bazaar tunnel, yet he always has some of the latest and greatest gear available.<br>&quot;Hello Maldan, hows tricks?&quot; <br>He didn't respond at first.  He never does.  He always seems to be watching the bazaar for some rare item that he can resell at twenty times what he got it for.  I waited.  Mean time Phread was busy talking to some gnomes and dwarves about barshing.   <br>Finally, he spoke.<br>&quot;Ah yes, what is it your looking for?  Serious offers only please.&quot;  Sometimes I think that Maldan was incapable of not saying that last part.  Then again, I have seen some of the kids that harass him.  They keep wanting to buy some of the more rare antiquities for prices that are way below even what a junk dealer would sell things for.<br><br>&quot;I am looking for a staff.  Seen any?&quot; I asked.  <br>&quot;Hey pal, I see a lot of staffs.  You wanna be more specific?&quot; he replied.<br>&quot;Seen anything that looks like this.&quot;  I showed him the picture of the staff.<br><br>(to be continued) <p>The Good, The Bad, and The HAR HAR!<BR><img src=http://wsphotofews.excite.com/033/7b/6S/cr/D970446.jpg><BR>Bladecurser Mooseslayer, High Elf Enchanter<BR>Koraz Boneharvester, Iksar Shadow Knight<BR>Phread Ritesaid, Ogre Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubladecurser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bladecurser</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/1/02 9:22:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Final Case</span><hr size=1> Maldan generally hides his enthusiasm well.  I saw a brief flicker in his eyes. You would have to know what to look for to see it.  Maldan was intrigued.  <br><br>&quot;Seen one?&quot; I asked.<br>&quot;Yes and No.  The markings are some what familiar but the staff itself is not one I had seen before.&quot;<br>&quot;Any idea where to start looking?&quot;<br><br>One thing that I like about Maldan is that he does have a lot of money.  Most people that I encounter in this job don't have enough and like to play the information for cash game at this point.  Trying to offer him cash for this would be an insult.  On the other hand, he and I both know that if I do acquire something that his clients might be looking for, he is going to get first shot when it comes time to fence it.<br><br>&quot;That staff could be of Kunark origin.  Some of those markings are similar to stuff I have seen come from there.  Some of the runes remind me of somethings I have seen some iksar necromancers and shadowknights wear.  But some of the other markings just don't seem quite right to me.&quot;<br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>&quot;Not too sure really.  They look familiar but its just...&quot;<br>He had a confused look on his face.<br>&quot;... hmmmm.  They don't seem like iksar markings.  How much you getting paid for this?&quot;<br>&quot;C'mon, you know me better.  One, I wouldn't tell you.  Two, you are just going to offer me more if I bring it too you instead. Three, I wouldn't do that because this is business and breaking contracts is a good way to get yourself killed or out of work....&quot;<br>&quot;Ok ok, I would hate for you to flex that High intellect of yours counting to ten on a play by play of why you should screw over your client...&quot;<br>&quot;Four, I'll let my client know that you are interested.  Five, if I find 2 of them or any other goodies I am sure you will make it worth my while to give you and your clients first pop at them.&quot;<br><br>As soon as said that he was watching the bizarre again.  It is almost spooky the way he does it.  You'd think he was in a staring contest with a basalisk.  I went about the Bazarre looking for Phread.  When I found him, he had a small gathering of people with him.  They had formed a circle with people taking turns dancing in the center.  Some bards were playing some festive music and people were eating many baked good.  Phread had about 15 pies of various flavors stacked about him.  The funny thing is that I know he didn't buy it, he didn't steal it and he didn't beg for it.  People just give him food.  When I approched him he was talking to a halfling woman about...<br>&quot;Meel tikuts am whut yuse can use ta gits food.  Me tinkin dat if'n yuse gits nuff of dems, yuse have nuff fuud fer all yer palz.  Me not know where yuse gits dems tho but me am purdy sure that thems portant.&quot;<br>Shutter nodded her head in agreement.  I now know where most of the pies probably came from.<br>&quot;Hello Shutter&quot; I threw a clarity on her. &quot;I hate to interupt but Phread and I must be going. <br>Phread seemed a little saddened by this.<br>&quot;Go ahead and make your good byes and share your pies. But then we have to head out.&quot;<br>Phread quickly gave out pies and let them know that they didn't need to give him a meal ticket for it.  While he was saying good bye to everyone, Shutter offered to give us a lift to where we had to go. Before I could get done telling her that it was confidential business, she had imparted the Spirit of the Wolf upon me and Phread as well as a couple other things that I am sure would keep us safe.  Phread came back to say good bye to Shutter and just as we were leaving, I heard Shutter go &quot;EEEEEP&quot; as she saw her husband Xantheus over at Maldan's stand eyeballing some swords and axes.<br><br>We headed south. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhappytiger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Happy Tiger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lilcorner.net/som/pic/sprite4.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Original Whip Girl~</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/2/02 11:18:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://test3.thespark.com/sa/slut48.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Final Case</span><hr size=1> BRAVO!!! <p><center><img src = http://liquid2k.com/pandaxian/sigs/xiansigthing.gif></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udarkimusbloodblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkimus BloodBlade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/3/02 12:20:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Final Case</span><hr size=1> nice...

We spent much time together in these sands but that is a time long past.<br><br>Phread and I headed south.  Phread likes the desert.  Actually, its hard to think of a place Phread doesn't like.  If it has food or the prospect of a good &quot;barsh&quot; then it is ok with him.  As we crossed the sands I watched my partner.  He was looking for giants.  If he sees them, he wants to barsh them.  Its reasons like this I keep him around.  He is muscle.  <br><br>We stopped at the docks near the oasis.
