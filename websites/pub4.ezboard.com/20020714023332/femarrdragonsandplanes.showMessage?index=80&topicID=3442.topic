<br>
Is the Pledge of Allegiance constitutional.<br>
<br>
I don't think it is and I've tried to demonstrate why I think it's not within the framework of our constitution.  Maybe I was using the term &quot;equality&quot; incorrectly, in this case I was specifically referring to equality of religious beliefs which is a very important principle of our country.  Arguments for free public housing, welfare etc, are interesting but they are separate from this argument.<br>
<br>
Of course, I have my own biases, I'm an atheist, I'm not the bit religious which makes it hard for me to understand why people get so bent out of shape about other people's religions in the first place.  I would never hate someone based solely on the God they worship, because I honestly don't care, but I know others do.  People hate other people for their religion all the time and the government should not serve to isolate or divide the country on the basis of religion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, little Johnny didn't say &quot;under God&quot; during the Pledge of Allegiance! You don't believe in God, Johnny, you worship Allah or something?  I bet your daddy blew up the World Trade Center!&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course, that example is inflammatory hyperbole, but it still serves to illustrate the dangers of setting citizens apart in a Pledge that's only supposed to bring us together.  <br>
<br>
The founders of the country worked pretty hard to set up a government where everyone would be free of religious bias and yet religion is now continually encroaching on government, either by those endorsing prayer in school or additions to the Pledge of Allegiance like &quot;under God.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hey, I love this country, the fact that people can freely argue and debate and bring lawsuits about the Pledge of Allegiance, it's a beautiful thing.<br>

By that statement either you are NOT agnostic, or you don't know what it means, or you don't know what you are.<br>
<br>
Agnostic takes no stance on the existance or non-existance of a higher power, basically believing that you are not pretentious(sp?) enough to say you know what is going on. That is agnostic. Thus you wouldn't care about saying it.<br>

Atheist on the other hand would, as you would then have no subscription to any belief that any form of higher power exists.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Good definition of agnostic and atheist, however not of my motivation. I think it's more disrespectful, as a non-christian, to participate in christian prayers and rites than it would be to just go along and participate. Of course, there are no black and white in this. Saying &quot;under God&quot; in some sort of pledge would be less hypocritical than receiving sacrament, but I'd still feel a bit uncomfortable doing it.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I just remembered something I wanted to say earlier: Isn't it true that one of the proper and legal ways of destroying an american flag is to burn it? :-)<br>
<br>
Ah yes, Federal Flag Code, Title 36, of the U.S. Code, paragraphs 176. Here are some interesting subsections:<br>
<br>
(i) &quot;The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.&quot;<br>
<br>
(j) &quot;No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
(k) &quot;The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm quite sure that (i) and (j) are violated a LOT...:-)<br>

<br>
-The Declaration of Independance-<br>
<br>
&quot;...the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...&quot;<br>
<br>
I was actually tested on the memorization of the above statements, how is that different from saying the Pledge of Allegiance?  An evil history teacher forced me to memorize and recite the Declaration of Independance in front of the other students, with its statements of &quot;God&quot; and &quot;their Creator&quot;... <br>
<br>
Is the court itself now in violation of the law? The Supreme Court opens every session with &quot;God save this honorable court&quot;<br>
<br>
Marines, (Note U.S. Marines, not you Royal folks)...we're in violation when we recite the Marine Creed...<br>
<br>
&quot;This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.<br>
...<br>
Before God, I swear this creed.<br>
My rifle and myself are the defenders of my country.<br>
We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.<br>
So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Marine Hymn mentions heaven, not God per say but the reference is still there.<br>
<br>
(just a quick note...Drill Instructors usually don't give you much of a choice when you're ordered to say the Marine Creed or sing the Marine Hymn and since a D.I. is a goverment employee, could this be taken as a statement of State sponsored religion?  ...actually, now that I think about it, putting a list together of rights that were NOT violated by the D.I.s might be easier...that extreme punishment thing...right out the window, several times...right to free speech...out the window bout the same time as the others...making me say God, those inhuman monsters...)<br>
<br>
Navy...I looked up the Sailor's Creed and found some silly thing about loving your swabs (mop) and being the janitor of the world...which fits the Navy, just don't think i can use that here...<br>
<br>
So...how far are we going to take this? When is enough enough? I personally dont care to learn a new version of the Star Spangled Banner or America the Beautiful and I like the Marine Hymn and Creed just as they are.<br>
<br>
I also guess that I interpret Serparation of Church and State oddly, I have always understood it to mean that the Church did not answer and could not be controlled by the elected Government and vice versa. I don't understand how &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, &quot;God save this honorable court&quot; and &quot;Under God&quot; violate the 1st amendment as these are not laws, just statements. (Course, my interpretation may be why I'm not a Supreme Court Justice....)<br>
<br>
One last comment, and Im sure this will not go over well, the folks saying &quot;love it or leave it&quot; need to open your minds and learn. It is our duty as citizens to question the government and its decisions.  I will not blindly follow the decisions that go against my up bringing.  <br>
<br>
We will never agree 100 percent on the way our country is run and we should always feel comfortable enough to question those decisions that are made, but I do think there are other issues that need more of our and the court's attention than &quot;Under God&quot;.<br>

The words &quot;under God&quot; are too insignificant for either side to get this worked up over, which is why it took so long to find someone petty enough to try to get it removed. (There may have been other lawsuits.) I don't think the words really belong, I don't care much either way, and I don't think this will be the straw that destroys the American culture back. I don't think the other examples of religion in government excuse anything, in the same way that other speeders don't protect you from a ticket. They exist because a lot of politicians are either very religious or wanted to appear so (religious voters seem to remember being slighted better). Also, when was the last time you heard the Star Spangled Banner sung in full, with religious reference, not that it would matter for NON-GOVERNMENTAL situations?<br>
<br>
  Pray all you want, in your nationalistic pledge or not, but remember that a major ideal of the USA is tolerance. What are you losing if it's taken out? Can we replace it with &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;? Finally, who wants some ice cream?<br>

<br>
Why now? Why is it now so bothersome. Because it is being contested and fought over in the news.<br>
<br>
Why were the people that agree with this not out fighting for the destrution of these two words for the obvious pain it has caused them since birth?<br>
<br>
<br>
The only thing dividing the country are the adults fighting over what people 200 years ago meant rather than what they said. <br>
<br>
Are there referances to the creator and god in other official state/federal papers? Is a referance the same as tying someone down and feeding them a page of the bible every day till they crap little holy angels? No it is a referance. They don't Say &quot;Our nation, Under the God of our father who art in heaven who smites the unbelivers with his Ample might and power of Blah blah blah.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just because some people belive in nothing doesnt give them the right to make others feel guilty in beliveing in something.<br>
<br>
People are using thier own beliefs (in a lack of belief no less <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ow Brain cramp</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) to color what is said. To make changes to something that offends them so that thier will is imposed on everyone elses. As in the complete destruction of anything Government used operated or supported into recognizing a god / religion of any type or context.<br>
<br>
I dislike religon a great deal. I don't see the sense of it. I get into arguments with my holy roller sister much of the time because of her new found religon. But for me to say she cannot belive in something is just as bad as me saying that I must belive as she does.<br>
<br>
Also one question for the agnostics. Kind of a pissy question. Since you belive in no god. Of any type. Do you have a soul?<br>
<br>
Not a pleasent question to ask is it?<br>

that would be atheist...as agnostic would neither believe NOR disbelieve. Think of it more as a scientific standard..cannot prove NOR Dis-prove the existance of a higher power or soul for that matter.<br>
