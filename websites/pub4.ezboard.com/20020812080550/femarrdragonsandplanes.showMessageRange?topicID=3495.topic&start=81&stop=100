Now, perhaps because folks dont want to go to those lengths and have someone show up and invoke PnP or flat out KS the mob, camp times are down to a couple days before he can spawn.<br>
<br>
This is leading to multiple clerics camping in parallel and these messy arguements as the camp shifts from that of a solo cleric to a full raid force.<br>
<br>
What we need to fall back on is the respect almost universally observed for an assembled force clearly capable of killing him.  That didnt happen on the incident that started this thread -- and that seems to be because there was a dispute over what constituted a killing force and when they arrived as far as I can see. (these are personal opinion, not my guilds).  I would suggest the following:<br>
<br>
To arriving guilds:  If a guild has had 18+ members for over 4 hours assembled in Skyfire before you can get your 18 there, let them have the spawn and move on.  If you can get a killing force there within 4 hours of their gathering then random them for right to kill ragefire.  Sure some may be able to kill with fewer than 18 but we need something to hang our hat on.<br>
<br>
To camping guilds: don't be upset if someone else comes along within a 4 hour window after you have assembled a <br>
a killing force.  Random it and have the loser help winner <br>
fend off any last minute interlopers that cant abide by this etiquette.  If interlopers show up later and invoke PnP or attempt to KS then blow raspberries here -- its one thing to roll over a solo cleric with no chance of killing a mob themselves, its another to roll over an incumbent force and the server should hear about the latter.<br>
<br>
This may in fact lead to some lengthy entire-guild camps in skyfire at the start -- but then again its that important to some guilds to get their first sprinkler or two.  Over time though camp times would go down. <p><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41357>  Xorgo Gorgonzolo</A> Ogre WarLibrarian of ANLAH'SHOK <BR>

I have had my Druid Cathos parked in SF for a month now poppin in and out. I was there the night before and Noone was on track. I was the only one in the spawn area. I waited about one hour then logged knowing that by the morning He may spawn. So i logged in and started getting peeps there at 8:30. there was some AD and a grp of PC. Heres the thing. I was incontact with another cleric there that had a MB grp to help who I said could join us. He was non guiled and I agreed to share with him and wed roll. Now things are heating up and tempers flaring. I spoke to members of PC whom we have had problems with in the past. This time however everyone in PC was very supportive for a multi guild effort and AD was having no part of it. thats the fact. GM comes in and agrees with Grisel that RF was a FFA and any guild that has a force there may try. well AD was still flipping out over this and I guess petitioned again. Gm comes back and says Ill random 1-500 closest gets camp nuff said. I won. MANY peeps there where very cool about it. wishing me good luck and all of that. A few from AD got very personal and nasty twards me and I have never met them before. Oh well. Im sorry that someone had to loose. RF will spawn again. I kept a force in sk for 18HRS untill server reset. And have had members there since its been back online. I just wish peeps would relax its a game we play maybe some need a break.<br>

well thats my 2cp.<br>

You ran over someone that had been there for a friggin week.  You can go to hell and sit on a hot coal.  You say no one had been there, why dont we make a call to the server and ask how many people saw him sitting there for a week solid.  You and your group are PoS and I'm glad the server went down before he spawned because you DAMN SURE didn't deserve it.<br>
<br>
Of COURSE PC agreed with you this time, they were forcing people out of their spawn too.  It's a mob mentality.  <br>
<br>
As far as Phoenix Crusaders, here's a list of their epicced clerics.  Over half their clerics have their click sticks, but apparently they need more bad enough to force others out.<br>

<br>
1. It seems to me that the majority of the people responding to this post agree with Razer (AD) to some extent. That tells me that &quot;common&quot; sense dictates that Alderac (AD) was in the right. If that were not true then there would be a hell of a lot more PC, GL and others supporting PC's and GL's side. Your own guildies haven't spoken up in your defense... what does that tell you?<br>
<br>
2. The people that are saying &quot;quite complaining, its VI rules and we have to live with it&quot; are right in a way. Unfortunately, that has no bearing on this discussion in that we are talking about common courtesy and respect for others. These rules are in place to help decide the outcome of a dispute. These rules would not have applied if the 2 guilds in question had common courtesy and respect for others.<br>

And not that it really matters since I don't have logs, but I personally arrived at the camp spot at 2:30am CDT the night before - there were about 10 of us at that time.  I logged @ 3am.  I logged back on @ 9am cdt and there were at least 2 groups of AD there.  I logged back off and came back on @ 10:30 am and was there the remainder of the day.  From the point that I logged on at 10:30 we maintained no less than 3 groups.  The 2 unguilded peeps were there most of the day by themselves, but don't recal when they showed up - I know there was a single PC in the zone most of the day, but PC and GL did not start showing up in force til about 5pm central by which time we had about 40 people there.  We at no point had any issues with any of the camp spawns and were quite capable of taking RF at any point after 10:30am that morning........  With that being said, why would we want to compromise and make a deal to share the spawn when we clearly had maintained a force at the camp site to do it ourselves?<br>
<br>
Anyway, its over and done with and the damage is done - I hope we, as a community, can find a solution to this issue that is satisfactory to everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udakawaka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daka Waka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/02 12:53:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Wait why is that I dont deserver it again?

<br>
If the shoe was reversed - you would be upset as well.....<br>
<br>
Yes, there will be other spawns and yes this is just a game, but its frustrating when you put an exceptional amount of time into helping your guild get something it needs and somebody else's inconsiderate behavior blows it for you.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I don't think that sitting here b*tching  about it any further is going to fix anything.  <br>

We have the power as a community to decide some sort of solution to this issue - needs to just be a majority rule kind of solution - there is no way that everyone is going to be pleased, but its painfully obvious that until some sort of protocol other than FFA is decided that this crap is going to continue to happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwistik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wistik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/02 1:09:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> Yeah well Pc sucks live with it. they been doing that since day one good for them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udakawaka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daka Waka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/02 1:19:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1>  I for one was in the first lottery and was all for it. BUT the larger guilds where not. I think we should all write Sony and express this to them. Heres the thing. This RF brings out the worst in many of us. I feel thats due to the fact that the most everyone feels RF is a FFA and GM are supporting that with &quot;if you have a force here you have a chance&quot; Nothing is said about how long you sat there or anything. Sony changed the camp I didnt. I didnt start the thing with deserve I was responding to the statement I dont deserve, What make me not deserve as aposed to another deserving is what I was asking. Anyway Id like this whole thing to rest and move on. There will always be he said she said stuff and all the name calling and personal threats like taking My breath if you need to take a breath. My goodness its kinda getting old.<br>

About the shoe getting reversed thing Im not sure that I would be mad. Im not saying I wouldnt but, I have been in that sittuation before and bowed out gracefully. I hope I would get to do the same again if in that situation.<br>

I am not calling you a liar .... but I KNOW we had 24/7 coverage on that camp.  Right wrong or indifferent, we were always there.  I just wish the right thing could have happened in this case.  For anyone who knows Alderac he is such a kick ass guy.  I mean I cannot think of another guy who has ALWAYS been there for our guild.  Last nights events really broke my heart.  They broke my heart because I truly care for Alderac and his progression in this game.  They broke my heart because I know how much this meant to him.  It may be just a game, but please remember there is a human being behind those pixels who has feelings.   Personally I have never really liked PC or GL.  Sorry, I have my reasons and experiences with them.  You see a cleric there with a force large enough to win, then dont try to assemble quicker.  Just help them out and some day they will return the favor.  Life is shitty enough, why cant we find some way to get along even if it is just a game.<br>

Of course you want it to be dropped, your the one that was in the wrong. You DID NOT deserve it for the express purpose of waltzing your ass in at the last minute and taking it from someone who DID sit the camp out. If you cant see this, maybe your not a complete a$$, maybe you're just that mentally deficient.<br>
<br>
As far as the threats, the ONLY thing that has kept me from trashing my reputation (which is flawless in game) by trashing your guildmembers every time I find them is the good people in AD who you wronged. Because trust me, without their good hearts, you'd need that damn rez stick. Call it a threat, call it what you want, I dont give a damn. Just know that the next time you see an AD person, there's a good chance they were one of the ones that stopped me from running you from one end of this server to another rezzing your people.  Why you ask, because they're constantly reminding me that we're better than that.  That we WONT drop to your level and we aren't above common courtesy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulollarronyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lollar Ronyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/26/02 1:43:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Sorry , I didnt stamp my post<br>

<br>
I am a PROUD member of the greylords and have been  my whole eq life..there are times we  as a guild have been run over and had mobs takin from us...Just cause  the guilds were bigger and stronger than us..and yes it will leave a bad taste in your mouth ..till ya sit down and think about it then ya think.. well hell it happened it's over and  ya might hold some grudge  over it all or ya might just move on and become more determined to not let it happen again. <br>
<br>
The ragefire incident in question could of went either way yesterday .. From the time we arrived  we were called names and berated for even being in the zone..and to clarify yes we had  someone in SF  from the moment the servers came back up...so did PC and then AD cleric showed..just a fyi there.. as to the force there to kill it..maybe AD got there's there sooner  and had 45 lowers levels there the 25 GL's and the 15 PC;s was a force big enuf to take rage so the numbers do not really matter..the force for 3 guilds were there supporting there clerics... the 3  guilds there 2 tried to make a solution to the problem seeing they all thought they had a claim to it since server had come up and all 3 had been there..within  a few minutes of each other...But were AD people even a little nice  No..it was it's ours and you can piss off basically..i talked to the cleric in AD myself and  tried to get him to see a 1 in 3 chance was better than none and  i suppose most think understandably he was right in saying No i won't budge..but if there  whole thing was to get a ress stick in guild and they are such a small guild ..then why not accept the 1 in 3 chance..we as greylords HAVE never killed ragefire or gotten a click stick for our guild..We are also a smaller guild  did you see ater draconis reaching out to  us..even when i suggested helpin them..no we were cussed at in tells berated  and told to piss off more or less..so yes it may have been then we decided hell yes were staying...if ONE person in AD had been the kind decent people you claim to be maybe it would have been different....this we will never know.<br>
<br>
Our guild has helped many people recieve and do parts of their epics..and have acted with respect to those we feel deserving of it and we will continue to do so... <br>
<br>
Dalamarn anytime you feel a need to smack around a GL let me know..we will see what can be arranged in way of a duel and  it is examples of your post is what we recieved from peeps in AD..we were not even givin an chance to be respectful..we were made to be defensive from the very begining..to get respect you must first be deserving of it.<br>

<br>
Vanyaurd, of course you were put on the defensive, you recruited a solo cleric with some MB wizzies and then PC to help drive the DESERVING party out of their spot.  I dont need duels, if I hadn't been called down by AD, I've got much better ways to deal with people as a necro.<br>
<br>
It's sad that you have been ranover in the past by pondscum.  What's even sadder is you dropped to that same scummy ass level and decided that what you want is more important than anyone else regardless of the effort they have put into it.  With an attitude like that, it's no wonder you're proud to be a Greylord.  Keep screwing people over and you can start a whole new group that has no respect for others and screws people constantly to get what they want.  All I can say is you wont find AD pulling that garbage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3495.topic&start=221&stop=223>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3495.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3495.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=100><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3495.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3495.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3495.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3495.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
