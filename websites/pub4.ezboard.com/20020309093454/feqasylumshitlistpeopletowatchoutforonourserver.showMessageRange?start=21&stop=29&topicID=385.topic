I've seen a disturbing trend in the 30s and lower zones lately where people don't respect other's camps.  Instead, they say the PnP lets them do whatever they want.<br>
<br>
Conceited is one of those.  I don't even remember the zones anymore, but being KSed and trained multiple times quickly got him petitioned.  Of course he's still in business, still pissing people off and using the PnP as his excuse.<br>

You never will, if you keep pullin that PnP crap. Certain spots in the camp are considered CAMPS. Learn them, respect them, if someone has them before you, they were there BEFORE YOU, respect that, and don't use some lame rule to enforce your will on others and ruin THEIR gameplay for your own selfish wants.<br>
<br>
Just a word of advice. PnP is the mantle of the lonely player.<br>
<br>
Take it as you will.<br>

Ummm, lots of folks that my alts run into try to use it to force there way into a camp weather they are in my atls group or another group or solo.  /sigh   That PnP rule seems to be seen by some as an excuse to get what they want right now and to hell with anyone else.<br>
<br>
Whenever stuff like that happens I just sit there and try to explain to them, that while the official rules say PnP and we all have to abide by it.  The unwritten rule of Layns is you respect other folks camps and you can ask if they mind sharing. And depending on the camp most folks don't mind, again it really depends on the camp.  Noone would share a camp like the GBS, AC in OOT, or something.  You just have to use your best judgement.  Put yourself in their place if you where there first would you mind sharing that particular camp?  But start sprouting PnP at folks and you are going to ruin your rep and will be seen as a camp stealer.  And its your rep that matters as you gain in level, and people will remember what you did to them or their guildies.  Its your rep that you must protect more than that little virtual item that may drop.  And once you ruin your rep it is extremely difficult to repair it.  While a few have been able to repair their reps later, it took them months to do and having to turn the other cheek to all the crap they took on a daily basis.   Is it worth it just because you want your way now?  I know some of those that my alts talked to about this took it to heart and they are wonderful players and have not ended up on a poopie list.<br>
<br>
To bad someone didn't get to all the newbies to our server when they were still new here to learn how things about Lanys.  And what will ruin your rep if you continue certain behaviors. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

I am not worried about it though. I have higher chars and chars on other servers. Everyone that knows me and has grouped with me doesn't have a problem with me. The only people that do have a problem with me are the ones I asked to share a large spawning camp and they were so greedy they couldn't do that. And as far as raids go I do plan on going on many raids.

With pulling everything that spawned the group wasnt getting enough kills anyways, when you showed up and sat at spawn spot group got 1 out 3 spawns thanks to you.  See it pays to have a twink, at least you know what lower lvls are talking about.  So dont give me shit about being greedy.  You never even mentioned anything about sharing there, just came and took the camp spot.  And yes what you do in your past does reflect on the future, Gurge is a good example of that.  <br>

I invited you to join a guard group to which you replied.... ill only join if you dont let anyone else join ( he was our fourth member )  to which i said... at the mo theres no0one else in zone so ya itll be just 4 of us. so you joined. we were there for an hour or so when with you continually spouting.... remember im gonna leave if anyone else joins, i can get more exp soloing the LO room and osargen...effectivly taking the camp that you had been doing with us...<br>

<br>
All that stuff adds up.  People remember...<br>
<br>
Just because its highpass, or oasis, dont assume that people wont remember the stuff you do.<br>
<br>
If your plan is to go do raids and stuff, your reputation is very important.  It is better to be unknown, rather than infamous.<br>
<br>
Just from reading this thread, i know that if we needed another on any raid we ( inner fire ) were doing, Nirad would probably speak out against you going, and that would be enough to have you not be invited.<br>
<br>
Even if i hadnt read this thread, and even if Nirad had never posted, when your name came up, im sure he would have said &quot; nope dont invite that guy&quot;.  &quot;ok&quot; would have been the response...<br>
<br>
PnP, tho it is in the policies of the gm's is generally not accepted in certain camps here on lanys.  a few people have said that you didnt even ask ( which is also a requirement of PnP ), and summoning a guide to take a camp from someone leaves a bad taste in everyones mouth that they dont forget, rules or no rules.<br>
<br>
Might want to remember that in the future<br>

I would not deny him his spot, but I didnt want to deal with it.  The group leader thanked me for &quot;someone saying it&quot; and told Concieted that I didnt want him in the group.  Concieted then come to our group in Window... spent 20 minutes yelling at everyone in the group, then stuck around long enough to kick anything I mezzed.  He even bragged about doing it over ooc, and I have the pic of the text showing it.<br>

Now honestly there were some people in the group who had some descent experiences with him.  But I think even they got to see his true colors come out.<br>
