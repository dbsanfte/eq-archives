Whether the battle raged spanning centuries, or just brief moments, only silence laments it now. Silence. Time's stamp passed slowly through the long since subsided foment and ever its unwavering eye lingers over ancient valor witnessed there. <br><br>Remorse, that sorrow which cries lowly: who also fell? And who are lost among their dead? What revulsion gape'd at this forested place so long ago? <br><br>Stars glitter and they will yet shine silently on. <br><br>Choking in trampled upheaval, on gore of bits of fair flesh and their own swathe of bloody conflict, ever nameless, is a sacred memory: see, here yip's the stricken grass, and witness over there, stunted Oaks. These things know.    <br><br>For beneath there some dark forbidden death is laid in the precious soil. That unalterable stench does not ever fade away. <br><br>Enchantment, ennervating ripples of its magical power linger preserving something of this ancient leafy sanctuary yet, which stood here: glad memories to fill you, a wandering passerby, with renewed satisfactory vitality that grows, and blooms to life, and mushroomed here the wise Ages long ago into a leaping forest of uncanny wilderness. Up into birdsong far beyond the eye. <br><br>Time paced the long while here since, upon this ground, and the green citadel slowly yielded unwilling to sup on that dark forbidden stain. It did become sickly, yellowing in both blade and respectful leaf: where no shadow before yet fell. Though Fire has scorched the forest and dunes creep over it. Something remains. An evil loosed Sorrow into this wan verdure and in its quarrel gives this tale there. <br><br>Harken thou upon these words, O Wanderer! This ground is the old glen of bright Elven home's ancient forest door. <br><br>[more to come]    <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/02 7:21:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/24/01 10:08:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Title: the next chance just beside an opportunity</span><hr size=1> A lone figure walks amid the thick forest's trees. Approaching it grows a swell and a murmur of other folk who follow. In this deep forest thick tree trunks obscure all view of direction an unbidden wanderer might seek to guide them. <br><br>As the lonely figure sought its way, in his mounting years lay reveal'd a noble and powerful hew: the rare grace of him would appear eldritch. This was an High Elf, and one who bore grey streaks upon his mien. No human briefness of years spanned his supernatural life; no simple grace of an ordinary aspect, no insufficiency, lent him this lifetime endured in often torrid passage through the fae world of Norrath.         <br><br>Birds sang, ah it sounded so pleasant! <br><br>A bold look around halted his thoughtful step. A different rhythm in the forest newly held his attentive musing. Ears listening for wary sounds stalking him heard instead the trusting hearts of confident nearby footfalls approaching. This was no sign of danger. Unslinging packs he set down Bow and Quiver beside them, on a bed of fallen leaves, and then he allowed himself to relax.<br><br>He had stopped momentarily to allow the strangers following close to join him. Yet he still appeared armed, a yorelade knight, in armor, indeed he was armed, and his Elven tunic covered a bright metal glint of Platemail. <br><br>Upon his back a magnificent cloak of Snow Leopard fur fell well down from shoulder to the ankles. It was lined with Silk and trimmed with Sable, its lapels and hem of Ermine. Upon his helm rose the silver wings of the Storm Petrel fashioned for his ears.     <br>     <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/02 5:51:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/01 10:00:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Title: the next chance just beside an opportunity</span><hr size=1> At his side hung a great sword.

Here are no foes.&quot; He spoke as if the words were given to somebody standing beside him, but he patted the great sword. <br><br>The touch ignited a sudden fiery light springing forth within blessed Imladrisel. Intense brilliance shining from depths inside the scabbard that reached all along the length of the blade to the sword tang, and pommel grip. The wise veteran could only shade his shocked stare, blinded at this sight. His reeling sensibility now seemed to feel Imladrisel' unnaturally stir, writhe wildly from wakened rest to rise unsheathed at a mere touch. <br><br>Upon his ears its sound rang out, unmistakably crying hot rage as clear as a scream of an Eagle, and to his staggered amazement Windshoal saw that he beheld a Holy Sword of great Takish Hiz answering truly, at last.

He had returned again to this place to search for a meaning there, when Imladrisel spoke to him with this sign. Much was afoot that he did not understand. <br><br>Such a sign held within it terrible meaning, he understood its was a protest, against evil, implicitly: a great wrong must cause to him this unearthly summons. Again he trembled in fear, for the thought occurred to him now that he was called by The Lady Tunare to oppose some nameless quarrel of heaven, unaided. Yet he also dared not to set aside this doubt for obviously his fearsome enemy must lay somewhere ahead. Reason enough to tremble. <br><br>He barely finished considering anew the matters Imladrisel presented to him at this miraculous sight of standing upon thin air, when a new wonder began.<br><br>Imladrisel's long shriek took on deepening pitch until it grew so changed that its scream now became the roar of great conflagration. An awakened blast of filial fire risen within it sent a resounding shockwave rushing through the great forest: a hurling wind that blew against the very hand of Time. Windshoal was dismayed, for he understood Imladrisel would flare brightly in dire battle. Never did any blazing sword in Elven memory loose forth eldritch brilliance with a similar vehemence.<br><br>"Am I dead?" Windshoal implored the air around him for answer. Nothing stirred, yet he saw that around him the forest still stood. <br><br>"Imladrisel! Am I slain, what is this unnatural thing which I witness? I beseech you, reveal its purpose to me. I am wholly dismayed that I see my doom is graven upon your wrath."       <br><br>        <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/02 6:05:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/28/01 1:51:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Title: just past the next chance right beside an opportu</span><hr size=1> A touch at his shoulder spun him wheeling around, half expecting to face his nameless dread enemy, instead he saw that he looked upon a woodelf maiden clad all in Lambent armor. She impatiently dismissed Imladrisel's roar, as if standing within its holy light was a common sight, which it was, and gave motion to Windshoal to take the sealed note which she took from her satchel. <br><br>His fears forgotten, Windshoal couldn't decide which stunned him more, this maiden's blithe ignorance at Imladrisel's grave sign or the fact that she clearly believed her own singular task, a common one, remained still the more urgent of them. Her note bore the King's Royal Insignia on the parchment wax but surely that could not outweigh this compulsion of The Lady in heaven. <br><br>"Listen, hey look listen, the message is straight from..." began Silvermoss, as politely as she could. <br><br>His frightened glare shot hotly back at her and she noticed the empty scabbard he wore hung at his side. Silvermoss resisted an impulse to throw off the Lambent armor and likewise convince this gaping knight that he must face a calamitous situation. He did not even notice her taller companion.<br><br>"That blade is Imladrisel, a holy sword, young maiden. Do you mean to suppose that the King's bidding must foreswear divine purpose, since heaven itself calls me?" he angrily interjected, indicating at the blazing sword before she had finished.<br><br>"I am honor bound, the SongWeavers will not hear of heroic Elf glory unsung; alas, here I see you are doomed against any hopes of an bright outcome. Heaven certainly purposes that you shall oppose its foe, with your life, typically the price of our sacred mortal struggles. Your sword surely cannot be a trifling thing to ponder." <br><br>Silvermoss stifled the yawn which might have angered him before it escaped.  <br><br>Windshoal was not consoled. He clutched at myriad possibilities. It was true, he may not remain alive once this promise of battle was fulfilled. For now he was grown old. But with small aid he could hope to fight into his final remaining hour. Perhaps this woodelf maid was sent to him for this very purpose. <br><br>"So it was you who always pursued me. I grew aware of your days long pursuit behind. I thought some enemy hunted me." He opened the parchment without more delay and finally commenced to read it.<br><br>"The palace is ransacked..." it began. "Both King and Queen are taken from us to where none may guess the place..." and there he stopped reading, Windshoal knew he could not bear to finish reading more.<br><br>"So this is the meaning of Imladrisel." His voice sobbed, broken inside him came his thudding heartbeat. The parchment fell crumpled from his hand onto the earth. <br><br>Imladrisel flared painfully brighter, it seemed, a brief moment. <br><br>From nowhere a howling wind came rushing at his ears and dizzyness overtook him. His sight sank into a deep darkness and he felt his strength failing him.  <br><br>"I must know what you think to do hereafter, sir. I do not propose to be a mere warmth at your side along the way. My treefolk have abandoned the city, High Elves all march in arms to make war here. I'm sad to say not a single soul has been spared, this matter is perilous indeed." Silvermoss smiled bravely. Windshoal looked sharply back at her. Presence of mind restoring his wits once more. <br><br>The tiny Woodelf plainly had more to say so he nodded dumb consent. Silvermoss, clasping to his elbow for support, now strained her Woodelf's height on tiptoe to gain the reach of his ear. She must officially address him thus, it was his turn to sigh now, for the Royal Seal upon his parchment compelled her salutatory obeisance: from ancient times their formal ceremonial heraldry. <br><br>Though the two Elven peoples resided under one united Elf Kingdom only the woodelf maidens performed a royal court ceremony of tiptoe address, Silvermoss was one. <br><br>In the memory of the Royal Court, a woodelf maid on tiptoe held no other rival for sneaking past company unobserved. Since time immemorial High Elves had cherished the legendary fame of their Queen's loyal train of woodelf handmaidens. In the eyes of the Woodelves themselves, however, the only way to whisper secretly into the ear of a court High Elf is to reach it first. <br><br>This revealed her upbringing among the court nobility to Windshoal, grinning grimly he was impressed. No less than a Royal handmaiden. Queen's Lady-in-Waiting for certain. <br><br>Recognition of her correct Heraldic form of address to a member of the Royal Tunarean court further enlarged Windshoal's own sense of his gathering doom.   <br><br>She continued, whispering in a quavering voice: "There is no question that elves gave themselves into slavery to be with their King. Our slaughter is gruesome, scattered throughout all the Elddar forest are bones of butchered Woodelf maidens, stripped of flesh like so much cattle. Dainty meat commanded to be sent to the shadowy enemy's foul table. <br>I have observed our kindred meekly go to this unholy sacrifice, for their King's sake, and recieve the knife across their throats." <br><br>"They march, perhaps to Nektulos, without any will. None seek escape and they cannot be persuaded otherwise, they do not hear." <br><br>This Silvermoss said matter-of-fact, her voice began sounding broken and dejected as it trailed away. Then finally she was miserably silent and hot tears came streaming down those lovely cheeks. Numbed by the enormity of what she just told him, Windshoal was caught totally unprepared: he did not know what comforting he could offer her. She crumpled in a fallen heap, clinging fast to his legs like a desperate child sobbing at his feet. The road before their kingdom lay heavily upon him.<br><br>   <br>              <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/02 8:19:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/1/01 5:01:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Title: just past the next chance right beside an opportu</span><hr size=1> The strange maiden beside Silvermoss was suddenly vociferous. Indicating Windshoal in the native woodelven manner, but alas! in a noisome voice she uttered with an alien sounding tongue which was unascertainable, to Windshoal, whether as passing for her speech, or not. For she spoke, apparently in a language, but this tongue was unknown to Windshoal: he could not fathom it. <br><br>Silvermoss, finding some composure, forced herself to resume the court tiptoe until she had explained the stranger's tale, for his benefit. That she was in a real sense literally standing on ceremony in their crisis agitated her even further. Still this was a legitimate matter for the Royal Court's business.  <br><br>"This maiden is from a tribe called "Human", new among the Barbarians, though she is sprung from Elven stock through the sire, and now is made a Ward of the Druids. She is half-child and may not dwell with her mother's people, and wears but a thong piece for her modesty." <br><br>Silvermoss exhibited her young charge with pride so that Windshoal could fully examine her. The girl was not self-consciously aware of an interest at her mere naked appearance, which relieved him immeasurably. Even Silvermoss, eyebrow raised, herself felt able to relax somewhat in the warm presence of their greying High Elf. Still, her strict childhood refused to let Silvermoss remain at ease long without suddenly remembering the tiptoe, she felt this thought most perturbing. <br><br>Her name was Feana. Standing almost as tall as he, Feana went afoot barebreasted clad only in tall fur-trimmed moccasins laced up fast with long strips of cord. A leather thong-piece barely covered her crotch, just as Silvermoss had said. Shining small dewy leaves dusted themselves into a sparkling emerald Circlet which perpetually ringed Feana's  head atop her astonishing silvery hair. Hiding his stare, and not a little admiration with it, Windshoal noticed her eyes too shone brilliant green and how she wore an innocent elvish grin. He felt her bright innocence strongly, Windshoal silently admitted that he felt a goodly liking for the girl.<br><br>"I am curious still to hear why she does not cover her breasts. I had thought this was the common fashion of people." He told Silvermoss this privately. The answer though did not surprise him.<br><br>"Feana was cast out from her mother's folk still a tender babe - because of her strange Elvish birth. Her mother did not teach her to dress but to live. The Druid maiden walks alone throughout the forest attending to the great trees and wild creatures. When Druids came upon Feana wandering and alone, in the wilderness, and found her thus naked, they immediately claimed her guardianship for the Lady Tunare of Heaven.  <br><br>"Moreover of her protection even the Barbarian Goddess, Marr herself, declares Feana singularly inviolable, thereby heaven recognises in the father's kindred the race of Elves. Thus Feana astonished the forest: the Druids correctly proclaimed Feana is a sacred trust upon all of the Elves, in the name of Tunare, Mother of All... <br>"It's a long story, Feana is blessed by the Gods. Young just as she appears now, ever naked, unchanged. First living of her new race to walk Norrath: all heaven is clamouring over her. Mother Tunare has granted this responsibility to the Elves." <br><br>"Behold!, maidenhood is not lightly sullied." trilled Silvermoss sternly... No longer bound by any formalities of their Court her patience had at last stretched thin.  <br><br>She snatched up Windshoal's arm. Thrusting his hand upon Feana's bosom. Instantly, the sear of tearing flesh burned in his hand and he let out an involuntary yelp. Looking anxiously at his hastily withdrawn hand he saw that it was freshly scored with some deep scratches. Windshoal felt his face redden, and the two fae women studied his burning complexion with a fascination in their gazes which made his face burn even more.   <br><br>"Feana has said.." began Silvermoss, clearly not done with Windshoal yet. <br><br>Translating for Feana, she continued speaking to him, "Imladrisel's sign is not as fatal as you imagine. Therefore do not dismay, holy knight. This sign is a beacon to the Elves. All can see it." <br><br>Apparently, Feana understood his own tongue! Windshoal did not ask if the half-elf child could also speak it, he reasoned that Feana must deliberately wish this secret kept.    <br><br>"Here finally is an Elvish host which had sought some sign to follow", Silvermoss ended. Now Windshoal looked and saw that Feana pointed to a gathering company of Elven knights newly-grown around them. The keener senses of the two maidens detected these latest Elves arriving before he was aware of their approach.  <br><br>Brightly armored Paladins kept their gazes averted from the naked Druid, and they drew even more distance from Feana when one, an unwitting female in the company, again demonstrated Feana's invisible guardian: a shield of thorns. The proud Paladin glumly nursed deep scratches on her newly bleeding hand. <br><br>She clutched Feana's wrist meaning kindly to take the maiden aside, and find her some clothing. At the shrugs of her male companions she glared, it appeared clear to them that there might soon come quarrelsome blows and so they wisely rummaged around in their packs. Fully over a hundred more elf women Paladins among their party stood behind her, glaring likewise at the knightly elves about them. From then onwards, no High Elf ever spoke uttering comments against Feana's apparent choice in dress or made joke at her uncustomarily bared breasts. In the vast Elddar forest more strange things had served clever minds and hands for their owner's rainment. <br>         <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/02 8:22:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 5:39:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Title: just past the next chance right beside an opportu</span><hr size=1> The Elven host assembled into ranks before the command had been ordered and busied itself with preparations for battle. Amid the din and clattering of metal armor Imladrisel's roar ran through Elves like an intonation of purpose. Windshoal knew with certainty he must decide how to lead his army into battle against their enemy before he dare hold the sword, Imladrisel, aloft. <br><br>Windshoal's brows knotted, he had been feverishly planning their assault even as he left appointed officers to carry out the first task of discovering his army's strengths and numbers. It was obvious to him now that the sword would reveal which direction their next course lay once he determined to wield it and do battle. He came to the place he had left fiery Imladrisel still flaming and found the holy sword surrounded by a throng of robed Elves. Amidst this group Feana spoke in her strange tongue solemnly nodding her head now and then. Some debate between them was apparently settled. Feana turned to face Windshoal, now she spoke addressing him directly in Elder Elvish.<br><br>"Noble Knight, the sign of Imladrisel is clear to all Elven lore, not least of it to magic and enchantment. None that see this sacred sight shall know rest. None shall put aside the path you must set upon us now to save their people and find your King. It is certain, by such a grave token the Elves will never return to this ancient forest wholly unopposed and ever again see their great city still standing proud." <br><br>Feana did not smile. Something about their dispassionate gloom disturbed him, another burden that lay upon Feana which she did not name. Windshoal guessed that the Druid maiden shared her secret knowledge when she spoke her own tongue to these robed Elves.              <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A> at: 11/18/01 4:57:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/15/01 9:10:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Title: just past the next chance right beside an opportu</span><hr size=1> The gathering numbers of Elves drawn by Imladrisel's light swelled their host to thousands.

Thousands of glittering swords shone against the bright fire of Imladrisel and in amongst the gleaming Elven ranks shone the short swords of Rangers not least - though the stark woodelfs held their great bows ready now.<br><br>Beyond Imladrisel ran a small stream, here before it the vast Elven host recieved great power from all spells of Eldritch arcane lore which their knowledge possessed: Heroism, Runes, Regrowth, Shield of Words, and many more were the deeds of magick wrought around the host. Windshoal saw that with their power at its fullest it was time he lay hold of Imladrisel, and to begin the fury of his assault. <br><br>Muttering obeisance to Tunare on bended knee, Windshoal rose and in full sense of grim war set his hands firmly gripped upon the sword Imladrisel. With that act ten thousand flaming swords flashed in unison. He saw that the Elves likewise all similarly had prayed to the Lady even as he did so himself.  <br><br>Now there was wonder in them, for their sight saw beyond their beloved Elddar forest across a seperate Plane of their world. A window into nether-space lay revealed to the Elves, in it a road ran before them. Enclosed on all sides by solid rock. The robed Elves murmured spells of power, some wove binding incantations but they stayed their ground, there came a nodding murmur of recognition at their newest revelation within the light of Imladrisel's power. <br><br>Seeing no sign from them to delay longer Windshoal and the army of Paladins surged forward sounding their battle roar.<br><br>Behind him, Windshoal knew the Woodelf Rangers already sensed their enemy, indeed even Silvermoss. Now she beat a chanting song of battle for the whole company on her Selos drum which brought the hot blood rushing through him, their strength rising, unnatural speed hastening them. <br><br>Far ahead he thought he recognised disciples of Hate, though he was at a loss to know what brought the unnatural beings to assemble armed against captive Elves. At once, a din of fighting appeared to set the Elves against each other but Imladrisel screamed anew, and the eyes of entraced Woodelves long captive in this place were opened. <br><br>They ran swiftly in their thousands past the knights and quickly gained their freedom behind the safe protection of the Rangers. An unnatural power suddenly gripped the Elves, cold malice washed them, then from out of the ground a horde of rats came. Rats quickly fevered and weakened elves that held firm against this attack but their evil lord did not reckon with the deadly aim of Woodelf archers, nor the power of the holy knights. The rats were quickly put asunder. <br><br>Silvermoss saw Windshoal and his Paladins raging further up ahead now brought their terrifying battle everywhere, against ever greater foes, and the shouts of bloody fighting was in deadly earnest. <br>Dark elf-like creatures, a huge Dracoliche she thought resembled in its terrible onset the fearsome dragons. Dreamlike she saw they all heard the barking doom of immortal Tashani. She saw them glance nervously about. Even discomforted and knowing fully that their resistance to Elvish magic was gone, the dark foe came at them still, unworldly bedlam swarmed over the battle from every side. The fall of furious Elves ran like an icy tide, some withstanding the insidious embrace of dark malice but not the evilly poisonous humor of their sudden wounds. <br><br>Fellow knights rose undaunted beside them and laid their healing upon the dying. Yet their own plight was plainly as dire. Over it uproar came from all around upon the ears of Silvermoss, everywhere she turned she saw total pandemonium and its shocking sight revealed by the light of Imladrisel shivered her company of Woodelves.  <br><br>Now Silvermoss saw that the mysterious robed elves made an assault of magicks, great fiery blasts that shook the Dracoliche. A mighty shock of magical Swords lacerated it, wounding it further, and in every direction she looked a deadly rain of arrows fell on ruined enemy.  Starfire and Scoriae roared, Lightning blasts thundered, Feana must surely be here as well. The magical destruction of Tears of Druzzil seared the black shade of Hate and shrivelled his sea of disciples, Silvermoss realised with a terrible chill that here where she stood the entire remainder of the elven people fought and were dying. <br><br>Even just now hundreds of shining High Elves were flung horribly asunder from their fighting at one cruel blow of a titanic fisted paw, they lay still never stirring again. Then she saw Windshoal, blinding bright against the vast monstrous dark shape. <br><br>The others could not reach him.<br><br>The titanic fist of Hate only struck a glancing blow against the others, for Innoruk battered him with terrible and savage force directly, armor did not withstand the brutal power of this unnatural being's spite. Silvermoss saw Windshoal stood his ground all broken inside and he fought on stubbornly.                         <br><br>    <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A> at: 12/2/01 10:25:52 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=146.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=146.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br><br><center><font face="Verdana" size="2">Entertaining the Erollisi Marr community since 12/16/99!</font></center><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
