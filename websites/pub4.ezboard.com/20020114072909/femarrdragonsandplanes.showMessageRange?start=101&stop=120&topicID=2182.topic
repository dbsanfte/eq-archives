I said things LIKE SoS.<br>
<br>
This is dmg/del of human fists post 50.<br>
(50-52) = 14/30 Delay<br>
(53-55) = 14/29 Delay<br>
(56-5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  = 14/28 Delay<br>
(59) = 14/27 Delay<br>
(60) = 14/26 Delay<br>
<br>
So post 55, your fist is better dmg/delay in off hand. Before that, it comes very close that the difference is almost negligable and will this also allow you to not taunt so much.<br>
<br>
So as I said, any monk using JM in off hand should be drug out into the street and shot.

Some may be from groups where noone involved could call &quot;Need&quot;, but I'm sure thats not where the majority of it came from.<br>
<br>
I live by the system personally, but everytime I see a high end item being auctioned I think of the times I had to bow out of the random. I understand that people get upgrades, but that also makes me think of the first group that gave the &quot;needs to be upgraded item&quot; on NBG.<br>
<br>
I was trying to find the old post on the richest people on E-Marr to use as an example, but I had no luck.<br>
<br>
At this point I'm not sure which is better the FFA till all gets an item or NBG. When I'm playing my cleric I've noticed that NBG seldom benefits me,but I'm sure it benefits some people. <br>
<br>
Just for the record I'm not a loot whore,but it is nice to do the dungeon crawl and have a chance at reaping the rewards for the effort once in a while though.<br>

The vast majority of people just wouldn't do it.  Even then, there is no doubt that it happens, and there are some people who have gotten rich by abusing NBG.<br>
<br>
A much more common scenario is the one that is revealed by the last few posts about the Jade Mace.  A JM drops, and everyone drools.  Everyone in a melee class says, &quot;Me me me!&quot; and comes up with a reason why they &quot;need&quot; it.  In fact, all of their &quot;need&quot; claims are fairly marginal.  One of them wins the item, then winds up getting something better in a couple days, or just decides to sell it to get something better.  No one is maliciously abusing NBG, but the end result winds up being pretty much the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umismort.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mismort</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/1/01 1:03:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> In a case like the rogue jade mace, Locustlure thingy, I agree it is a nice upgrade for the rogue.  Both weapons tuant alot though from the low delay.  What I do in a case like that if I claim mfg is turn the &quot;upgraded&quot; item - in this case the locustlure- up for group random.  Plain and simple if the item means so much to have it as an upgrade, yet isnt a dramatic improvement turn your other item in for roll.<br>
<br>
The other day I did that, I was wearing rygorr chest (been wearing it for too damn many levels).  Seb scale coat dropped.  Now there was a cleric in the group that had need for it, and I had need for the ac plain and simple -str was a caviat.  I asked to be on the roll for it.  I know it is a good wis item chest for clerics shamans etc, but it was an upgrade for me as well.  I won the roll got it, and told the group please random my rygorr.  That simple.  <br>
<br>
In that case it was a need for greed deal, BUT it was not a tremendous difference. In turning in my chest I did two things, I showed the group that I would indeed equip the item, and I returned to favor to the group for letting me be in on a roll with only one other person for an item that was an upgrade.<br>
<br>
I dont know if any of this makes sense, but remember what comes around goes around karma all that shit.     If you treat someone like an ant I promise you that you will recieve the same in turn...someday.<br>

<br>
Though you might be right about high-taunt in Jade Mace, but for me Locustlure only taunts awfully when it procs (but it does that often enough to cause more pain than gain).<br>
<br>
Thus I have to disagree with this particular example. I'd say good rogue needs certain weapons. By being good I mean using one's potential the way you can best do. I think rogue still needs the Locustlure. Just like casters need different spells. Unless that rogue has Willsapper, which totally owns Locustlure (in slowing mobs that is).<br>
<br>
In my bag of weapons I currently have: Serrated Bone Dirk (snare), Journeyman's Walking Stick (tash), Troskillian Skean (sp) (stun casters), Locustlure (slow) and Blood Point (plain damage with low-taunt lifetap proc).<br>
<br>
And I'm not pointing out your way playing Mismort, I respect you high as a fellow rogue (as you recall we saw eachother at least once in KC ages ago =), but I know there are lots of other rogues who collect the toolbox too. <br>

<br>
   What about those 6 level 55+ spells that just dropped from juggs that noone even thought twice about giving to the appropriate class caster who could use?  Remember when kunark was new and some spells were going for sick, sick amounts of cash?  The only reason you can get/afford to buy them now is NBG.  You really, honestly want full random?..casters would get the bone even harder than they do now if they had to roll on spells too...and prices of spells would definitely go up.<br>
<br>
   Face it..Melee's depend soley on their gear, casters rely on their spells.  If a few instances of greedy assholes getting an item that they sell off for cash really bothers you, consider how much more it would bother you if said greedy asshole won a roll over you for Mark of Karn, or muzzle of mardue, Malo, etc, etc...any of the rare spells that help you play your class to its fullest.<br>

At this point, I don't have any of the 56+ cleric spells.  My options are: (1) buy them on the market at huge prices if they ever become available, which is rare because of the large number of high level clerics, or (2) keep going to OS and looking for people who want to camp Reets/Juggs.  NBG isn't doing me a lot of good here.  I think a lot of other casters would agree.<br>

Hehehe, I know what you mean.  But yes, I would.  You'd want to be selective about the group, for sure.  One of the biggest mistakes that people make in OS, and other dungeons, is to persuade themselves that they can get by with one or two group members who are not in the proper level range.

It was won fairly in a simple random.  What the winner does with it at that time is their business.  There's no abuse here, it's not like you're saying &quot;I NEED that item&quot; (thereby eliminating 5 others from the chance of acquiring said item) only to be seen in EC 2 days later auctioning that item off to the highest bidder.<br>

<br>
there is no perfect system for randoming loots.. but still beats the hell out of giving something away to some one based on the fact that they are more likely to use it than I am. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufitemah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fite Mah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/3/01 9:30:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reets/Juggs and NBG</span><hr size=1> I thought it was alpha random one through six.

<br>
I understand that, I was just using an example, just to show how one person being greedy about the price of a spell can cause another to be greedy about the price of a weapon/armor, and it works both ways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The problem is, and has always been, that there are few Kunark mobs that drop the 56+ spells. Occasionally you will hear of someone getting one off a mob in Skyfire, but most of them come from the mobs in the bowels of OS. Verant has done nothing to help casters with these spells.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This I agree with and would love to see change so we don't have to pay 10k for a spell.<br>
<br>
Alpha random is the fairest way to distribute loot, however its gonna suck big time when Regrowth of the Grove drops and I have to shell 10k over to the cleric who won the random because thats what it sells for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My new guild is 50+ only also so easier to find stuff to do with intead of LFG all the time. Having alot more friends at high levels from helping tons of people with epics and raids, so I trust people more to be honest about NBG and i'm hunting less and less camps that drop anything at all as i'm just getting exp and hanging out with people. And raising my alts instead of leveling my 50+ as waiting for group in OS as most know is pretty boring.Half the time I'll log on and get asked for help, or to join a group now or I'll have something to do anyhow. I also have friends helping me camp items I need to upgrade and then we camp items they need.. we tradeoff and it works well so loot isn't as important in my exp groups.<br>

<br>
One of those ultra-rare Haste belts dropped. Only the 2 melee classes rolled and Zeno won (Gratz Zeno!).<br>
<br>
We were thrilled that a contributing member won such a coveted item.<br>
<br>
Girdle = 20k (or more)<br>
Great player that can use it, got it = Priceless!<br>

You rock Morbida!<br>

NBG is for those of us who would rather make friends than plat.<br>
