Also, Why did you want to kill Warders? To DO it right? To actually say you did it? Well, we wanted to wake the sleeper to do it, because we put a lot of time and effort into trying it. We failed 4 times last night before we finally got him.. <br>
Also, are you just disregarding the 4-5 posts that have already stated we were trying this before you guys were ST capable? That should end the argument now. Unless of course you think we tried something for 4-5 months but because you can enter we should stop trying all together. /shrug<br>

Did i want to kill W4 for a once in EQ life time experience in waking the sleeper (kerafyrm), and then proceed to get torn apart by him? Hell yes.<br>
<br>
I'll admit it here, i attended this event on purely selfish motives &quot;I&quot; wanted to experience/be part of this event. Personally ive been going to sleepers tomb for 6months now and soon as i get the chance to turn in my key and get rid of it, its gone.<br>
<br>
Bigmeeno, i personally dont give a shit about Fallens wants/needs. The only mob you guys even kill that bothers me is Statue, cause it removes any chance of us trying AoW again. As a guild we HAD been more focused on AoW than releasing the sleeper. With the removal of this option and the slow down of patches, we looked at what other SoV goals we had yet to complete and this one was foremost on the list. Tunare and AoW our now the only goals left on the list for SoV, with the current difficulty of getting a shot at statue expect Tunare to fall soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubigmeeno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bigmeeno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/30/01 1:42:51 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleeper Awoken</span><hr size=1> Caex, you were not in Visions 4-5 months ago.

<br>
I'll credit you tho, for speakin the truth. That I respect.  Not pissed off as much about the warders, as I am about the tells thinkin I should be grateful primal is easier, if 100x's more boring, like you're some kind of fuckin samaritans.<br>
<br>
And if you thought Statue was the only thing that bothered, removing warders from the game only made it 10x's worse.  Those warders would've maintained some server stability for the next 2 months.  You guys deserve the credit for Ventani 100%. God knows that shit takes a fuckton of planning and preparation and dying for testing them.  Fact is, coulda been done with 1st up, and avoided a shitload of the flamage that is inevitable between the two of us.  Now it just comes a whole lot sooner than it could have.<br>
<br>
What your motives are, are your own. Personally, for a good few of you, it was the culmination of months of boring CoH'ing in and farmage.  I'm just sad the payout was &gt; fallout.  <br>
<br>
Some of the comments made here will work on the noobs, who don't know any better, but I've known a good few of you a very long time, and to those few of those who were at least honest with me, well, it's appreciated.  But wasn't too surprising.<br>
<br>
To answer a question previously brought up in this thread.  No, I'd never have killed the 4th w/o another being up.  VI may find a flawed script/poor implementation fine and dandy in this case, but I don't.<br>
<br>
I'll end by taking my own rules of engagement to heart.  If it's not outlawed it's fair game. I just hope the civility that's been shown so far (under the circumstances, with a few exceptions, it has been civil) is shown when it comes to encounters that are in the very near future.<br>
<br>
G'luck to us all, and congrats to you guys again.  See you in Sleeper's Farm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

<br>
perhaps one of the most interresting words in the english language today, is the word fuck. out of all the english words that begin with the letter &quot;f&quot;, fuck is the only word which is referred to as the F-word. its that one magical word, which just by its sound can mean pain, pleasure, hate and love. fuck like most of the words in the english language is derived from german, the word &quot;flichen&quot; which means to strike. in english, fuck falls into many gramatical categories:<br>
<br>
as a transitive verb forinstance: john fucked shirley<br>
as an intransitive verb : shirley fucks<br>
it meaning is not allways sexual, it can be used as an adjective such as : john is doing all the fucking work.<br>
as part of an adverb : shirley talks too fucking much.<br>
as an adverb enhansing an adjective : shirley is fucking beutiful<br>
as a noun : i dont give a fuck<br>
as a part of a word : abso-fucking-lutely and in-fucking-credible<br>
and as almost every word in a sentance : fuck the fucking fuckers.<br>
<br>
cause you must realize there arent too many words with the versatility of &quot;fuck&quot;. as in these situations describing<br>
<br>
fraud : i got fucked at the used car-lot<br>
dismay : oh fuck it<br>
trouble : i guess im really fucked now<br>
aggression : dont fuck with me buddy<br>
difficulty : i dont understand this fucking question<br>
inquery : who the fuck was that<br>
dissatisfaction : i dont like what the fuck is going on here<br>
incompetence : hes a fuckoff<br>
dismissel : why dont you go out, play hide and go fuck yourself<br>
<br>
im sure you can think of many more examples, with all of these multi purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word.  we say use this unique flexible word more often in your daily speach, it will identify the quality of your character. say it loudly and proudly, FUCK YOU! <p><img src="http://home.online.no/~carter/pic/Nimloth Saga.jpg"> <br>
