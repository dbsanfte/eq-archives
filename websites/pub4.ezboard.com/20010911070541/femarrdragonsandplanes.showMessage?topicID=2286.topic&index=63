<br>
Does EQ have an age limit?  Didn't know that...I was under the impression it didn't.  Of course, that's the de jure rule...the de facto is there are minors on it.<br>
<br>
But assuming all there are minors in the game, and that they aren't suppose to be there, does that mean the minors are out of luck, that they get what they deserve?  ::shrugs:: Personally, I think the entire concept of protecting minors is really over stated.  Anyone who thinks everyone under 18 has never heard a four-letter word or never been in a sexual situation (and that's our bigaboo on the West side of the Atlantic...violence is just fine in our culture, :P ) has obviously forgotten what it's like to be under 18. ;)  But that's me, the staff of EQ Traders has decided that they do.<br>
<br>
But this isn't about protecting minors in the end.  Or protecting people from RL (ir)religious expressions (what started this tread).  It's about what the admin for EQ Traders wants for their site.  Full stop.  They want clean language, children safe content, and removal of any RL (only) offensiveness.  In return for these restrictions, I get (free) access to the single best forum for professional trade skills on the internet.<br>
<br>
For a dedicated trade skiller (Grandmaster Smith (202) even, woot!!) this is a no brainer.  If I want to swear and cuss and flame and say sexually explicit things, I can always post here. ;)<br>

I've never really thought much of you, let alone your sig. I'm sure the first time I read it I just rolled my eyes and moved on. <br>
<br>
That being said... Kehvrynne, Niami, and the rest of those EQ Traders froots are complete Nazis with their board and site. I've had a couple of my threads locked... not because they were offensive, but because information was in another thread or the topic had already been discussed. The most memorable one was basically, &quot;This topic has already been covered. The thread is somewhere between pages 12 and 43 of this board. Please look around for it.&quot; I hate to accuse them of lying, but something tells me they were using the &quot;annonymous complaint&quot; as an excuse.<br>
<br>
Hey, I understand they have an excellent site and they (especially Niami) are stressed as all hell half the time. It's not a professional communication of stress though.. just pathetic childish grumpiness. I guess that means it's ok to take it out on every little innocent mistake someone makes. My best advice to you? Do what I did and stop going there. My best advice to them? If it hurts, STOP FUCKING DOING IT! Oh yeah... one more thing: Sig heil!<br>

&quot;hey, cool - you're wearing an orange dress. wtg man.&quot; <br>
&quot;so you believe in the great chicken, nice thinking man - so different. Cool, whats that about.&quot;<br>
&quot;You're a christian, wtf ... who believes those old stories nowadays. Get lost man, don't tell me about your religion.&quot;<br>
<br>
The only religion i know of that gets dissed no matter what is christianity. And the people who usually put christianity down have no clue what its about.

everyone else, thanks for your support, but the tradersgestapo has won it, like rara said, they come jank about a private message board in my mailbox, yet if it was private, then they should grant everyone a PW,so that is dead wrong, that site is public , owned by denmother , but don't give me the bullshit that a public board can't have the word jezus in a sig..even when it is gamerelated. there are totally no rules in EQ about religion and that we can't talk about religion..<br>

<br>
Does he have the right to be wrong and I have no right to right his wrong?<br>
<br>
And if Cendan believes he is right and Bulek is wrong (which he is, I know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) why does he not have the right to say he is right and Bulek is wrong?  <br>
<br>
And how is Cendan &quot;forcing&quot; his belief on you by posting it for you to voluntarily read while Bulek is not &quot;forcing&quot; his belief on others by posting it for them to voluntarily read? (ok, no right and wrong in this one, but can't pass up an opportunity to point out to hypocritical athiests the flaws in their demand for free speech for themselves but their &quot;right&quot; to freedom from having other religious views &quot;shoved down their throats&quot;)<br>
<br>
And for those of you who just aren't ready to take a side and say that any religion is any better than any other religion so why can't we all just get along then ponder this:  If there is a God (and there is) then what He says IS right, and anyone whose faith differs IS wrong.  So if God is Buddha (which he isn't) then everyone else is wrong, end of story.  If you have faith, you cannot be faithful without declaring that those not of your faith are wrong.  Doesn't mean we have to string 'em up, well maybe a few of you but that's another story, but to expect those with faith to suppress it to avoid offending your athiestic/agnostic sensitivities is very hypocritical of you when you are ranting about people with faith complaining about statements by others which are intended (yes, I said intended and I meant it) to offend those with faith.  <p>Cenelron Tank'n'Puller <BR>
