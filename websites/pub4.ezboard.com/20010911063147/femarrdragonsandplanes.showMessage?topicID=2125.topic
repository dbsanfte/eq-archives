I know there are some couples out there that have similar dealings.<br>
----<br>
<br>
I love computer games.<br>
You love computer games.<br>
But, chances are, your significant other doesn't.<br>
<br>
Try to get her(or him) to try and understand why you like to play games and it's trying to explain to a 3 year old why grandma isn't breathing anymore. It's hard and touchy, you have to dance around like Fred Astaire on speed. The fights get more furiocious than a bleeding cow walking thru the Amazon river.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you sit in front of the computer playing your damn game everyday?&quot; she might yell. &quot;Well, why do you sit your ass infront of the TV every night?&quot; you respond. The bell rings, fight's on, and it looks like its a 12 rounder, complete with below the belt punches and a few headbutts.<br>
<br>
I like to play games because it's more entertaining for me to move pixels around a screen and have them do my bidding than sit on my ass every night and watch &quot;Must See TV&quot;. I don't play games every night, maybe a few days out of the week, mostly when I am bored or just need a break. I am by no means a hardcore gamer, not that it would matter if I was.<br>
<br>
I don't sit chained to my computer, hidden from society, I  also enjoy &quot;normal&quot; things like sports, running, painting, sculpture and reading, but nothing can compare to the cost vs enjoyment of a good video game. I paid 40 dollars for a copy of Lord of the Rings. I read it once. I also paid 40 dollars for Roller Coaster Tycoon, played it for 9 months and it's still fun today. A book is going to be the same no matter how many times you read it, a good game though will be different every time (well, a good one will).<br>
<br>
Why do most people find gamers (and games) to be abnormal?<br>
<br>
The computer industry makes an absolute killing. Nearly 60% of Americans alone have a computer. 1 in 3 have a nintendo, playstation or sega. Yet, it's termed &quot;nerdy&quot; to play games.<br>
<br>
Final Fantasy games made 100 million each, thats almost a billion dollars on one series alone. Diablo 2 had over a million pre-orders.(thats roughly 50 million before it went gold) Some playstaion games have sold over 10 million CD's. Yet, there is no one hyping anything about them. But, you get Cats &amp; Dogs made 20 million on its first weekend and that's world stopping news. <br>
<br>
You get no respect if you like playing games.<br>
If you like to play Everquest (like most of you do, I'm retired) every single night everyone tells you that you're a freak, unplug and go get some sun. Well, you should take breaks from playing, like everything else, but playing games for hours on end is no different than staying up and watching that 6 hour marathon of Scooby Doo. (It's just more socially acceptable to sit and watch TV til you go blind.)<br>
<br>
Does your significant other like games too? (like mine, to an extent) Well, hold on to them, they're keepers. They've mastered the art of compromise and sharing. Gaming is just like any other hobby, it is time consuming, entertaining, and a learning experience (sometimes). <br>
<br>
For all of you out there that need help with your other, tell them. &quot;I enjoy playing games, that's who I am.&quot; If they love you, they'll accept you. You shouldn't have to stop doing something you like, unless it's smoking crack or selling kiddie porn. Try to include them, I know it'll be rough, but at least you can say you've tried. <br>
<br>
Play your games, but don't ignore the human being you have to sleep with. <p><center><b>Kinzix Kryx'Vkahl</b><BR>

It's definitely easier to find an SO who is into games (assuming you date guys).  It's a fact that more men game than women.  My SO and I both play EQ (he plays longer hours, though).<br>
However, if you think people look at you funny for being a guy gamer, try being a girl gamer!  I love to game.  I have LARPed and tabletopped for many a year, and I love EQ and I'm looking forward to some of the other fantasy MMORPGs that are coming out.  But since a minority of women game, people think you are even _weirder_ than if you were a guy.  People at game shops are usually cool, but even the non-initiated seem to think gaming is a guy world.<br>
Even gaming couples, though, have to come to some agreements.  As I said above, Arikel plays longer hours than I do.  When we first began playing, this wasn't the case.  We shared my computer, and I made sure I got as much time as I wanted.  However, when I went back to school (by this time he had his own computer), I couldn't play as much, and I just never went back to those 8-12 hour sessions.  Then, I had to adjust to the fact that just because I had cut back didn't mean he wanted to or planned to.<br>
But it's like Kinzix says -- you have accept the person you love.  And as long as I'm not ignored (and I'm not), we'll keep sleeping together.<br>

We both love our jobs, each other, and EQ. I've been gameing since i was around 16 or 17 years old (YAY Champions and D&amp;D). My hubby has been gaming since about the same age. <br>
<br>
When we first got EQ, we were sharing a computer. We decided soon after that we needed to get a second one, cause we were arguing over who got to play.<br>
<br>
 So now our life is made up of work, sleep, and EQ..and the occational time that we go out in public, hehe. We work together, play together, and hang out together,....I couldnt possibly be happier.<br>
<br>
 Recently, I got a phone call in RL from someone in my guild (whom ive never met in RL..it was someones bday in RL in my guild and i wanted to say hi..ended up talkin to damn near my whole guild) My Guildie talked to my hubby almost as long as she talked to me. It was a little bizarre, hehe but a really good time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 When my hubby and I go out, EQ is like a default setting when we dont have anything in particular to talk about..we just blabber on for hours. I think its a good thing if you can get yer SO into it..it just adds something that you can bond together on.<br>
<br>
 I got my cousin into playin around Xmas of last year and he and his girlfriend now both play , and their relationship is stronger for it.<br>
<br>
 So, I guess my full opinion on this whole subject is that it just depends....upon if you can get a 2nd comp, hehe, if you can deal with yer SO in game, and if this is really the kind of life you wanna live at this point in yer existance <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I fail to see how reading a book is better than a game.  In book's people like to emerce themself in other realities, imagining they are there.  What do you think games do? Games are just more interactive.<br>
<br>
And you are actually bettering yourself if you make friends in games like Everquest, people that you can also talk to outside the game.  I have made so many friends in Everquest and I woudln't give them up for anything.  You also learn how people act in certain situations, how they really are, unlike you can learn in a book or on tv, because you are not experiencing real people.<br>
<br>
You also get the enjoyment of helping other people in some games like Everquest.  The satisfaction of knowing you have made someone's day by helping them out and just being nice.  I get more satisfaction when I am helping people out in Everquest, weather it is helping my friends get an item, or ressing a total stranger without them asking and having them thank me, than watching tv, reading a book, or playing sports; it's a great feeling.<br>
<br>
People enjoy different things.  Obssesivly reading books or watching tv can do just as much harm as excessivly playing everquest game could.  Anything can potentially do harm if you do it excessivly.  I see people making up random off the wall reasons why games are bad for you, but they are not.  It is only some people who MAKE them look bad when they screw up their life because of one.  <br>
<br>
Weather it's an online game or just a single player game, people do their own things and enjoy their lives in different ways.  If you have fun making friends and hanging out with them in Everquest, thats great.  If you have fun playing single player games and emercing yourself in that reality (which is what books claim to do), so be it.  Or if you enjoy anything else that isn't inherantly hurtful to you or other people, have fun doing it and don't be swayed to believe it's wrong by people's ignorance. <p>tuan {cupcakes} the vicar<br>

Altho on certain occasions I liked to sit and whatch. Then a couple rl friends told us about EQ. I thought it sounded interesting. Watched my hubby play, then decided to make a character myself. Well, we only had one comp, so we fought about who could play when. We'd try to beat eachother on when we were home the same days. Well finally i was 50 he was 50 we emailed verant. Poof. I get my char transfered to another account, we buy a second comp. Tada. Then thats allll we did. We never left the damn house. So we quit. He sold his account I tried ebaying *gasps*. Needless to say I didnt sell and came back. But EQ is the root of all evil to him now *shrug* Both my parents play and a rl friend of mine plays makes keeping in touch a lot easier than paying over a 100 dollar phone bill a month imo. SO I play and keep him happy, its hard but I manage. <p>Ailae Sylvermoon <BR>
