My side of the story:<br>               <br>               Jamster was pulling cuzz wonderbri died, Jamster strolls up with Sylvan Protector ( un-mezzable mob ) and two Culler's ( little totem dude's that are un-mezzable ).  I don't know if Jamster was TOLD to pull or he did it on his own free will.... what I do know though is that he had little to no experince pulling in PoG.  At this point things were already looking preety bad, to make matters worse a Tranquil Treant ( un-mezzable, un-stunable, gateable, summoning mob ) strolls up and just preety much lets everyone know: that were all going to die.  I of corse die, and eventualy after about 1 hour, get rezzed, I loot a few things off my corpse and notice a PoG (a Protector of Growth REALLY ruff mobs....) running around causing havoc, i was about the only person alive except for i think one other cleric, the PoG ran off chasing someone and i stayed around the camp (big mistake) died, again.  Waiting around for about another 45 minutes, then I get rezzed again, this time theres one other warrior left alive withe me and the PoG is still running around, I die again. (prolly the other guy too :P)  Waiting around for about 30 minutes this time and I get rezzed a 3rd time, this time I get summoned (even though i did nothing to agro the PoG) wayyyyyyyyyyy the heck out in the middle of nowere, I am guessing it was by a seccond PoG.... at this point, I'm preety frustrated... ive lost 1 yellow into 56 and the level 56 itself.  When i get rezzed a final time (wich i might add Wonderbri thank you again Wonderbri pulled for me)...for the most part their were quit a few people still left alive... at this point ... i was invited into a group and the druid (who shall remain nameless b/c that druid probably saved me 4 or 5 hours of sleep) in the group ported alot of people out, I wasnt about to say to the druid &quot;Hey what the hell do you think you are doing? TAKE ME BACK TO POG NOW!&quot; cuzz i had school the next day and it was already 10 o'clock and my dad was yelling at me to get off the comp....... anyway........

I was confident that the pullers/experienced raiders would be benefitial to the raid in general and unfortunatly I was wrong.<br><br>Who pulled, I dont know, was it ok'd by me?  No.  We had PoG's coming soon and we were still getting organized from the move to the camp.<br><br>As far as pointing fingers and who's to blame there is no point.  We had a long and difficult corpse run, a few bitter souls who were frustrated with exp loss (someone who was completely irate that they got a 49 res and not a 56) since we were ressing as fast as we could with the only clerics that were left (the cleric with the click stick managed to escape the wipe out, ignore my tells to ask if he was ok, port out, turn on /anon, and camp)<br><br>Wonderbri and Jamster both bailed after they retrieved their corpses and were never heard from again.<br><br>At this current time there are still corpses (full clothed) in PoG from my characters because I was more concerned with everyone else than me.  Everyone was res'd back to the zone before the timers ran out with the exception of a guildmate who was in high spirits until about 2am who continued to help me retrieve others who had to log that were still stuck in PoG... everyone was retrieved (to my knowledge) except for myself.<br><br>We had a lot of help and everyone was awesome, patient, and understanding.  There were to many people who helped to thank, and I know they know who they are.  Those who used coffins/dots etc are still in need of reimbursement and I have every intention of providing such.<br><br>The people on the raid made me proud that we pulled through the way we did, despite the difficulty of the task.  We could not have done it alone, so with that said, the emarr community, guildmates, friends who came out to support us were by far amazing and outstanding beyond all belief.<br><br>As far as flaming the raiders/leaders/people involved there's no point... this is the @#%$ that happens and I know this... but for every bad run I've had I've had 20 awesome ones and I will not give up hope that the emarr community can pull through anything they can when working together.<br><br>This was my guild's first "horrid adventure" and I've never been so proud of a guild in my entire life and I commend them for their support/patience/and spirit.  The people who left the raid short on exp and with nothing to show for their efforts who sent tells saying that they had a wonderful time and would do it again... are the reason I play and do what I do.<br><br>Those who had poor attitudes, showed no support, and/or bailed when they could have offered some support... I advise you stick to your guild's raids and no one elses... or dont raid at all.  I've heard/seen much worse scenarios and what we faced could have been a lot worse.<br><br>With that said... flame away if necessary.<br><br><br><br><br> <p>Syldra Marlowe 52 Vicar<br>Guild Leader ~ <a href="http://pub64.ezboard.com/bsacrummortis">Sacrum Mortis</a><br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=114107">Syldra's Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usyldramarlowe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syldra Marlowe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/19/02 2:46:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3185.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The really bad PoG raid......that happend 3/18/02</span><hr size=1> And FYI, I know that you're upset about the experience loss, but keep in mind there were people who stayed til the end who lost way more than you did.

We had 2 runs... one started early morning and had almost half the people as the "bad PoG raid" and we got just as far and were extremely successful and had NO complications.  Our puller for the AM had never pulled PoG and was much lower level than the pullers for the PM run.  <br><br>We were not prepared for the event that presented itself, and losing the cleric with the clicker was by far, the hardest part.  Had I known he was going to bail I would have had another cleric camp out.<br><br>With the events that did occur and how the occured we are now prepared, atleast more than we were yesterday, for events similar that might occur.<br><br>My biggest mistake was allowing the lvl 60 players who came to call the shots as they saw fit, assuming that because they were in "high end guilds and experienced" that they would not falter... I do appreciate their help for the beginning of the raid and for making it possible to have the experience that we all shared... however I am disappointed in their level of respect and concern for those of us who remained there... with no apologies, no support, and no commitment to the "party" as we were ALL a team and its understandable that many people had limited time due to school/work etc... but with that being an issue perhaps going on a raid that starts at 6pm EST shouldnt have been attempted, considering the things that "can" happen on a raid... especially a pick up. >:) <p>Syldra Marlowe 52 Vicar<br>Guild Leader ~ <a href="http://pub64.ezboard.com/bsacrummortis">Sacrum Mortis</a><br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=114107">Syldra's Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukelin1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelin1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/19/02 3:11:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3185.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The really bad PoG raid......that happend 3/18/02</span><hr size=1> little to no exp pulling PoG..point?

It started off as a decent raid, but I will say a few things, people that have never been to PoG need to be told a few things and I never saw any /shouts or /oocs about what was unmezzable or should be pulled single. Since Syldra had been up to PoG twice that day we'll assume it was an oversight. Secondly, I as a puller, asked for buffs a few times and never even recieved a tell back. Guess I should've asked Syldra to kick some ass and get me buffs. Thirdly, I wanted to leave before I even died the second time. The unneccessary tells and bitter comments about not pulling mobs that drop &lt;insert class here&gt;'s armor were making me mad. Been to PoG a few times and I usually didn't get bitched at as much as I did that day. But it's all forgivable. I'm also getting over a bad cold and that prob added to my general pissiness.<br><br>After I died I waited a while thinking it would all work out and I offered to log on a druid and cleric to help with cr. I was told that everything was going ok. After another hour I logged on a druid and went up, pulled a few corpses, noticed Wonderbri's corpse had 33 minutes to be ressed. <br><br>At this point I started frantically clawing Cinergy's (my dear beloved BF) arm, and generally buggin him, so that he'd bring his cleric/res stick. The cleric and the druid get to PoG, Wonderbri and the druid get ressed. The cleric resses everyone in sight that's online, I pull a few more corpses and res those...<br><br>40 people were in the zone and we figured it was ok to leave. I don't feel bad about not staying or not asking the cleric/Cinergy to stay. If ya wanna flame someone how bout the cleric that came to res a guildie and that guildie only?<br><br>I also don't think its fair to point fingers at Barrelrider or Jamster the monk. Barrelrider said in group he had to leave, before everyone wiped out. The rest of the clerics should have been able to handle it. And I'm sure Jamster was just kinda embarrassed about training camp, which wasn't his fault. How was he to know?<br><br>Anyways, all in all it still wasn't the worst pick up raid I've been on. Ya don't even wanna know about that one. And cheers to Syldra for keeping a cool head and good attitude throughout the entire thing.<br><br>Oh, and Syldra if ya need help getting any of your corpses, or the druid's corpses back, shoot me a tell, but hopefully you have retrieved them by now. =) <br><br>Wonderbri <p>BlakMagi SaytaniqueShadowknight Level 51 <BR>Cinergy D'estroiyaWizard level 60<BR>Granola BushwackerDruid level 52</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uenbekay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enbekay</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/19/02 7:13:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3185.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The really bad PoG raid......that happend 3/18/02</span><hr size=1> The fact that you didn't have a Bard run the PoGs around is the number one reason your raid failed.<br><br>It's all your fault.<br><br>Sorry to be so blunt, but that is how I am.

If your group is strong enough to be doing the east side of PoG, you really ought to be able to kill the PoGs while wearing mage armor.
