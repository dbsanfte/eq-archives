<br>
I haven't seen anyone on this thread saying &quot;swinging is so right.&quot;  I have seen several people who have the arrogance to proclaim from their vast storehouse of life experience and morality that &quot;swinging&quot; is wrong.<br>
<br>
What I haven't seen anyone from the latter group do, however, is explain exactly where they derive their right to judge and dictate behavior, morality, codes of conduct, and what is &quot;right&quot; for OTHER people.  We aren't talking here about activity involving people below the age of consent (children), or non-consensual activity.  Why it is the business of anyone else how consenting adults choose to live their lives is just beyond me.<br>
<br>
Jelly, in your particular case, your former girlfriend engaged in non-consensual activity -- because you weren't aware of what she was doing, it wasn't discussed with you, and it went against your commitment to her and understanding of the relationship.  But that's not what the original post was about.  It was about someone who for reasons best known to him was perusing a message board for people who, with EVERYONE'S consent, choose to conduct their lives as they see fit -- and him assuming the mantle of avenging angel, spewing his views about whether that conduct was &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would remind long-timers on this board that Mr. High and Mighty Elnots is the SAME person who posted a lengthy justification and defense of his drunk driving.  &quot;Hello pot?  This is kettle, you're black.&quot;<br>

I'm sorry I'm not watching the Ezboard as closely as you seem to think I should. This isn't my life... this is only entertainment. It's quite possible that I'll post this today, and not check the board again for, oh no, another 24 hours.<br>
<br>
I'll admit the quite large possibility of being wrong. That's easy to do, and it's something that I can't deny. I'll admit only being a High School Student making the information I gave you only from 11 years of experience. I'll also appologize for the horrible tone of my post(s). Now let me explain myself:<br>
<br>
First off, the quote I gave you was word for word out of the New American Biblie, Saint Joseph Medium Size Edition.<br>
<br>
Next, the Catholic Chuch today does not say Homosexuality is wrong. This is what I've been told from my teachers (no, that doesn't possitively make it true)... But I explained their beliefs on it in an earlier post.<br>
<br>
I see how I made it seem in my post that I knew oodles more information about the Bible than you do. Honestly, I could care less about the Bible and definitely don't have it memorized, as you do, from front to back.<br>
<br>
Now, point one, as Frekkles said, "The text IS fallible, as are the interpretrations, were main points the professor was trying to make." <br>
<br>
Point two, there's a little thing called Historical Critical Method. I'm sure you've heard of it because of the theology classes and whatnot you've attended. I have not gone to any other than all classes up through High School. What the Historical Critial Method is, is a way of looking at the Bible passages as they were looked at from the people writing them. You see, in some parts of the Bible, women being treated as lowly, but not necessarily being treated horribly and beaten. Feminists today may see these stories in the Bible and may say, "Oh, look how horribly they treated those women. This book of the Bible is anti-women!" When, actually, the women were being treated very well... Am I rambling or do you understand what I'm saying?<br>
<br>
This was the point I was trying to make by throwing out my "butchered" quotes from the Bible. The reason I chose those 2 that really stuck out in my mind as off-the-wall. These passages meaned different things when they were written.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Like I said, I'm non practicing, but I just hate people that want to be normal people but with exceptions that go against the rules of what is considered normal.</font><br>
When I said I wanted to be normal, I didn't mean I wanted to change myself. What I meant was, I would have always liked it for the way I am, homosexual, to not be considered as different. Like my good friend told me one time, I'm Jeff who happens to be homosexual, not Jeff the homosexual.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>And God punished Sodom and Gomorah for many things, one of which was homosexuality......</font><br>
I read the passage. Using my inny weeny brain, but also attempting to think about what this passage is saying, I don't believe they're saying homosexuality is wrong. There's a fine line. It is honestly the way you interpret the passage. You could say he's downing homosexuality, or you could say he's downing the act of pure lust with random partners.<br>
<br>
It says from my Bible, "Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another. Males did shameful things with males and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their perversity. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God handed them over to their undiscerning mind to do what is improper. They are filled with every form of wickedness, evil, gred, malice; full of envy, murder, rivalry, treachery, and spite. They are gossips and scandalmongers and they hate God. They are..."<br>
<br>
He's not describing my form of homosexuality. He's not saying that two people that love each other that are the same sex are going to hell... He's describing evil, greedy, treacherous people who hate God.<br>
<br>
I mean, go ahead and say what you will, but looking on it as it was written 2000 years ago, I don't believe that applies to the homosexuals of today. And, because it is in the Bible, doesn't make it correct. There is a religion that I forget the name of that does go solely 100% on what the Bible says. They believe Adam and Eve were true people and one of Adam's actual ribs came out to make Eve, etc... But that's their choice.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I'm sorry for boasting. But the fact still remains the evidence that Knobb so visciously claimed didn't exist is there.</font><br>
You don't give me a chance to defend myself before saying I'm wrong a second time? Come on, give me a chance to respond! And, I'd like to read those other passages and tell you my views on them also, but I'd prefer to do it over Email because that was we're not clouding up the purpose of this post and adding to the Bandwidth of this Ezboard.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Yes I believe the bible to be as close to put it, 100% correct, because if I didn't then I'd only be believing a tenth of it is correct, since it has been said in the bible, (want proof Knobb?) that it is the word of God, and so if they are lying, then you'd have to assume that there are other lies in there as well.</font><br>
That is the word of God... That is an opinion you're entitled to. If they are lying... I wouldn't say they are lying. I believe the Bible if full of truth... But it's a different definition of your truth. It's not fact, it's a moral truth. The above passage was saying it's morally wrong to be lustful and just go around having sex with whatever pleases your body. (at least, that's what I understood) Again, Adam and Eve... they aren't lying. Oh wait, that's Old Testament though. Well, you keep saying "in the Bible." I'll assume from now on you mean "in the New Testament." But yes, even in the NEW TESTAMENT, I believe there are the same truths I mentioned before. No, I don't actually believe (oh no, don't shoot me) that Jesus fed all those thousands of hungry people with 1 loaf of bread and a couple fish that miraculously turned into many. And, it's not a lie. It's just that you read the story a different way that I did. I believe that it started off with a fish and some bread, but after Jesus talked and whatnot, other people began to share the food that they had had, spreading from one fish and bread to many.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>That goes hand in hand with the fact that some Muslims believe Jesus to be only a great teacher and nothing more, but if he's so great, and was spreading lies. Then I wouldn't buy much of what else he said.</font><br>
No one said they were lies. Plus, tell me if I'm wrong because I could very well be, in Romans, is that Jesus speaking out against homosexuality? I only read a very little bit before and after the passages you gave.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Being homosexual is immoral in god's eyes. So how can they say to be devote gay christians?</font><br>
I'm not sure who your "god" is, but the one that the Pope is under doesn't believe homosexuality is wrong. Are you following the same God as the Pope? Now again, if this fact is false, I'm sorry. I've heard it from more than one source, but haven't looked it up myself.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>And no denominations of christianity say being a homosexual is a good thing, except I would guess, a homosexual denomination, which is not a rightful denomination since being a homosexual goes against the word of God.</font><br>
Somewhat off this direct point here, but did you say before that you weren't against homosexuals? I mean, you could be like I am right now and just defending the Church's views and not your own true views. But the Bible was written 2000 years ago in a different place. There was, yes, homosexuality, but not in it's form from today. Do any say it's <i>specifically</i> a good thing? I've never heard one say it. I've heard them say being yourself is a good thing, but I suppose that doesn't count in your eyes. But then we argue if it's a choice, yada yada yada. Hmm... they label being strait as good so that you can be fruitful and multiply. Does that apply to today? With our population of 6 billion, do we still need to really be fruitful and multiply... Okay, maybe multiply by 1 to keep the species going. :P And no, I've never heard of a homosexual denomination probably because they died out from lack of spawn to pass it down to. ;) heh...<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>The issue is that the Christian community today was specifically told by Jesus that he had come to fulfill the Old Testament, and on his sermon on the mount, and later when he spoke to his disciples, he gave Christians instructions on how to live their lives, and what to do.</font><br>
<br>
When did Jesus say homosexuality was wrong?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>The old testament is history and reference, not rules. The rules are in the New Testament young grasshopper, let's continue.. If you don't like Romans, Maybe I'll show you the ones in 1 Corinthians, or maybe in Timothy? I can go on.. but I hope that you are beating yourself up for looking like an idiot challenging my knowledge of the bible..</font><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Want some old testament proof? Nah, I'll stop there!</font><br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I laugh at your "schooling". Your foolish attempts to sound like my better have just been pwned. Thank you, good day, and good luck trying to cover your ass!</font><br>
Wow.. A tad cynical? Show me more rules and passages. There's actually a line I like in Timothy.. well, I think it's in Timothy, but it states that one shouldn't judge another only on youth, but on the way one presents himself through speech, etc. Beating myself up for looking like an idiot to challenge you? No, I challenged you, and I am still challenging you because I still believe you are wrong. It's my belief... other people could possibly believe what I do, they could also possibly believe what you do.<br>
<br>
You laugh at my "schooling." Not saying you weren't schooled, but exactly (I know you wouldn't lie because you're so close with the bible and all) where did you get schooling on this? My foolish attemtps to sound like "your better" have not just been "pwned" because I had yet to reply. I guess I've covered my ass... <br>
<br>
Oh yea, my Email is Confused007@cox.net. Feel free to email me. Just please don't start sending porn and whatnot because you're aggrovated. Only Myzzan's allowed to do that. ;)<br>

I hope I covered everything...<br>

THERE ISN'T!!! Its not always black or white and its not always right or wrong. Sorry but there isn't always someone who gets hurt. Its just not true. Because your ex screwed around on you, totally behind your back and against the basis your relationship was built on is NOT the same as people who do this with foreknowledge, consent and can keep their bedroom escapades seperate from the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LOVE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they have for eachother. Its not like Siilv is coming home with a chick without Crom knowing, not taking HIS feelings into concideration and saying &quot;Come on honey we're gonna go all have sex together.&quot; I am sure that a fair bit of discussion between Siilv and Crom went before this was ever done, hell probably before they ever got married, and agreed that this would be &quot;ok&quot; for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> them</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and that they would really enjoy ENJOYING someone else in their bed <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> together</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Its also not like Siilv approaches some woman in a bar and coaxes her to come home with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> her</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> only to find out she's not just coming home with Siilv but with Crom too. It's not a deception like you experiences. Nobody is lying or decieving anyone else to get to the point where they all share their bed together. YOU CAN'T!!!! If you do it's grounds for a lawsuit if its the third party and grounds for divorce if one of the spouses does not agree.<br>
<br>
There is no <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> pain</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> involved in all this and you tying your own personal hurt to what they as adults accept as a pleasure in their lives and twisting it around.<br>
<br>
You know wolves mate for life but I gaurantee if you too the male and put him with another female in heat he wouldn't have any qualms about mounting her. I've watched at the Zoo a Baboon(sp?) jacking off {yes it was funny as hell and you should have seen the crowd of people there watching and taking pics with me lol} because it felt good. It has been documented that Chimpanzee's actually have sex when not in heat and not with their mates just to &quot;get off&quot; and for pleasure. Why am I bringing this up? because we're animals too and we're no different then they are when it comes to doing something that feels good to us and wanting to keep doing it. What does set us apart is our ability to create morals for ourselves and each persons set of morals is different from the next.<br>
<br>
My moto: You may not like it, you may not understand it, but unless you want to live your life in a hole or unhappy state learn to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> accept</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it and move past it.<br>

I know I've enjoyed it. What better topics are there to argue about then sex, love and religion? (unless it's politics)<br>
<br>
I can honestly say that I have a great deal of respect for people who are genuinely religious. But as much respect as I have for them...I have ten fold the disrespect for someone who just plays at being religious.<br>
<br>
Too often these days those individuals who would seek to judge someone or denounce someone for their personal life choices are themselves living a mockery of what they preach. <br>
<br>
Before you attack someone for how they live their life, ask yourself, &quot;Am I just a fair weather Christian?&quot; (or Jew, Muslim, Pagan...etc). <br>
<br>
I have never advocated that lying to or cheating on your life partner is acceptable behavior in which everyone may partake. <br>
<br>
Whatever is allowed or disallowed in your relationship should be decided at the very beginning of that relationship...and don't pledge yourself to a vow you can't uphold. <br>
<br>
What's worse? The couple who decides to share an open marriage? Or the couple who shares an open marriage behind one another's backs? <p><i>The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills.

I can show you that in the Old testament women were treated poorly. In the New Testament Jesus stands up for the rights of women, so any feminist groups that think the bible is total anti-feminist are probably the same ones that keep saying Jesus should have been born a girl, or that since he wasn't born a girl then he's a male dominanist pig with his evil penis of death!<br>
<br>
And how can you say you believe only &quot;some&quot; things of the bible. Thats like saying you will believe half of what is on the nightly news, or having selective listening. You hear what you want or feel is true. You have to believe in the bible 100% to believe in the bible, there is no gray area.<br>
<br>
I'll get you those emails Knobb, in reguards to the bible schooling I've had none, I just read it and made notes and bookmarks, with little tabs in the sides for quick reference.<br>
<br>
So if the Muslims believe that only Jesus was a great teacher * they don't believe he was the son of God* then he isn't lying? Because again there is no middle ground, if I say I am the son of God, and you don't believe me, then you'd think I'd be lying, right? Same thing. Jesus was not an insane or mentally ill person who people would say, oh it's just Jesus rambling on again about his &quot;father&quot;.<br>
<br>
And the Pope can make up any ideas he wants, he doesn't speak for God. Nor does any other human. It says in the bible that you can speak directly to God through prayer, but it's Catholics that believe that we should pray to Mary so she'll take our prayers before God.<br>
<br>
But the Pope doesn't change God's rules. Man made the seat of the Pope, not God. Read the bible and you will find that God does not mention a central figure for a church, nor does the word Pope appear in the bible.<br>
<br>
So the Pope can do whatever he wishes to, but it doesn't make him the authority to voice God's opinion.<br>
<br>
I'm not against homosexuals. I'm against homosexuals trying to be upstanding Christians. If they have read and understood the Bible then they ought to see that what they are doing is wrong.<br>
<br>
If it where the same with Islam I would say the same thing. If Allah said that homosexuality was evil then I would say to all the homosexual muslims out there that they need to rethink their life.<br>
<br>
Be gay! Be whatever! But you can't eat your cake and have it to. You can't live life immorally and be a Christian. <p><img src="http://moongaden.homestead.com/files/elnots.jpg

The Pope? are you serious.  Few religions are worse than catholicism.  Most actually believe what they teach.  When you intentionally change scriptures, declare your leader infallible to cover yourself, set up an unbiblical heirarchy of leadership, kill people who don't agree, and impose rules and regulations on your priests and sheep membership you have gone out of your way to not follow God.<br>

There is too much beaucracy*sp* in modern religion. Just take a bible, and make your own religion out of that. People call it Christianity in it's purest form.<br>

Which Bible? One that wasn't doctored by a group of people to suit their wishes, IE Catholic bible and the book of mormon.<br>

<br>
A Christian is defined as someone who professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ.  I attended Catholic schools for the first half of my schooling, I attended an indepth bible study for 2 years...and you know what?  Not once, was it ever cited that Jesus Christ himself ever saying anything against homosexuality.  References were made in the Old Testament, but no references from his mouth in the New Testament.<br>
<br>
I found a quote that fits you quite well...but the question is - since neither of us read Hebrew...which one is correct?<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow">1 Corinthians 6 (New King James Ver.)</font><br>

10   Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God<br>

2.Or wrongdoers <br>
3.The two Greek terms translated by this phrase refer to the passive and active partners in consensual homosexual acts <br>
<br>
<font color="yellow">1 Corinthians 6 (American Standard Ver)</font><br>

10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow">1 Corinthians 6 (Worldwide English Ver)</font><br>
Do you not know that bad people will have no part in the kingdom where God rules? Do not be fooled. There are some people who will not have part in that place. They are those who commit adultery of any kind, those who have idols, or steal, or are always wanting more, or talk wrong things about people, or drink plenty of strong drink, or take things by force, or curse. <br>

<br>
Who gets to decide which parts of the bible to follow 100% and which parts to follow only partially? Do you decide that for everyone? <br>
<br>
You admit you aren't currently a practicing Christian, where in the Bible does it say you can be an on again, off again Christian?<br>
<br>
Also...if you catch your wife cheating on you, do you get to stone her? According to the Bible that's what you do...and the Bible is 100% right of course...Call me when you do, I'll bring over some rocks and a six pack, we'll make it a party.<br>
<br>
Wake up Elnots. Every book is subject to interpretation, religious books more then most. If you want to be a Christian, decide for yourself what that entails and follow that path. <br>
<br>
I'm sure the Gay and Lesbian Christians do just that, who are you to say they are wrong? Judge not, lest ye be judged.<br>

That's according to the Old Law, but if we follow Jesus then show me where Jesus stoned an adultress.

My experience has nothing to do with the argument.  Well, maybe it does.  Whether you like it or not, there will always be a party who is hurt by these kind of unhealthy decisions.  Knowingly or unknowingly, it happens.<br>
<br>
If you love someone, why would you need a third party to participate in showing it to one another?<br>
<br>
Sounds like selfishness to me. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/kyliensigz.jpg"></CENTER>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Heveltica"><H6>So is that what you call a getaway? Tell me what you got away with, cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish, I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids. Have another drink and drive yourself home, I hope there's ice on all the roads. And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt and again when your head goes through the windshield. Is that what you call tact? You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back. So let's end this call and end this conversation. And is that what you call a getaway?  Tell me what you got away with.
