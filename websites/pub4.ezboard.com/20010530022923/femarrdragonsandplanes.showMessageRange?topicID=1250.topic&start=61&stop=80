When you have been waiting for one MOB for 6 hours and you finally get it only to have a ton of shit dropped on you, you get desperate.  In the heat of trying to stay alive, you don't necessarily make all the right decisions.  That MOB very well may be a quest MOB which Verant has chosen to make a damn pain in the ass to get.  You're not likely to say &quot;ah, that's ok, screw my quest.&quot; when you've just gotten trained.<br>
<br>
You can either get the MOBs away from you to try to finish what you were doing, or &quot;return&quot; the train to its rightful owner.  Either way, there is going to be trouble.  Either way, there is going to be the usual train to zone that happens every 10 minutes in KC.  Either way plenty of people are going to be pissed.  Either way it wasn't your fault to begin with and you were just reacting.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying anything is right or wrong, it's just that I can understand how it would happen.  I also have a real problem with the fact that there is an implication that Da`Kor is the only group of people alive that could be in this situation.<br>
<br>
You know what's amazingly stupid?  People training the damn ZONE IN in Sebilis.  I have been caught in more of those damn trains than I can count.  THERE IS NO FREAKING EXIT THERE.  That is the most idiotic and selfish thing that a person can do and yet it happens daily.<br>
<br>
Ever see a flame thread on it?  Nope.  If *I* somehow caused one of those, do you think you'd see a flame thread on it? Yep... Unless I was anon...<br>

  I think it's kind of funny that you quote my disclaimer, that the actions of one person do not necessarily mean that every member of that persons guild is like that person.<br>
<br>
  Then, you turn around and defend that persons actions.  In point of fact, I was not directly commenting on what happened in Karnor because I was not there.  <br>
<br>
  What I was commenting on was that the last few times one of my chars was killed by external influence ( that is, that I did not get myself killed somehow ) it was a DaKor or Umoja person that caused it.  You then proceed to defend the actions of your buddies.  <br>
<br>
  I guess to DaKor it is ok to use fear in a dungeon so that you can snipe the named mob.  That might be an interesting tactic to use in OS, wonder how that will turn out.<br>
<br>
  I guess to DaKor it is ok to make multiple trains of (relatively) high lvl mobs and not announce it.  <br>
<br>
Whether those things happened or not, you are defending it out of hand. <br>
<br>
Ealan says :<br>
<br>
&quot;How do my comments lead you to believe that we &quot;own the board?&quot;<br>
<br>
In your previous post you questioned my right to post a comment here.  Why did you do that, given the examples of lost experience and time I gave?  My comments were not directed at the incident, but at the elitist and generally uncaring attitude that I have seen coming from you guys.  The fact that most of you find the incident 'funny' or 'entertaining' just adds fuel to that fire.  <br>
<br>
I cited some incidents in which my chars needlessly died due to a general lack of any courtesy from some of your guild members, you asked for names I gave them, but you will never stop defending your guild because you think you can do no wrong.  <br>
<br>
The sad fact is, this attitude and behaviour is what I and many others have come to expect from DaKor.  That might explain why so many jump on the 'bandwagon' to flame you.<br>

I think you're missing the point.<br>
<br>
The point isn't that a guildie trained someone or inconvenienced someone. Like you said, trains happen all the time.<br>
<br>
The point is that there's a difference between saying,<br>
<br>
&quot;Oops, sorry, I screwed up&quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you shouldn't have been sitting there.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I try not the train people, yet it happens from time to time. Do I defend myself, justify it, deny it? No, I say &quot;Jeez, I'm sorry that happened, do you need help getting your corpse?&quot;<br>
<br>
It's really that simple. It's not about making mistakes, it's about making good on them.<br>
<br>
If there was an apology made to the original poster, I didn't see it.<br>
<br>
What I did see was a David Letterman impersonation of &quot;20 instances in which it's OKAY to train someone.&quot; You seem to be saying &quot;It's a dangerous world, shit happens, get over it.&quot;<br>
<br>
But of course dakor can never be wrong. Even though the original poster wrote up a very polite account of what happened, he got shot down and had his intelligence insulted &quot;Maybe you should grow some balls and not sit at the zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well gee, I can't imagine why anybody would think you're pricks.<br>

anyways what is this shit ? flame dakor ?<br>
Dakor MAYBE made one mistake and blammo FLAME THEM!!<br>
but the numerous Times that dakor HELPS *gasps* people out , is NEVER mentioned.<br>
ok fearing is stupid , but according to Dowd post, they tried to kept their group alive.<br>
Here is what my experiences is with Dakor.<br>
They are nice to me .<br>
They helped me in the past.<br>
they did a CR in OS for a fallen comrade (who did something STUPID) and WASNT dakor member..*Gasps*<br>
They see a cleric of Dakor at the zone , and asks for a Rezz , it happens without hesitation.(sp)<br>
I was in need of something and gained it FREE*gasps*(sup JP)<br>
And yet , im sure im not the only one who had those experiences.<br>
Have WE EVER seen a post regarding this ?<br>
Im sure this is what happened.....<br>
Dakor member X HELPS *gasps* Guildmates. He needs to fear things to get the CR done apropiatly , Forgot *gasps, they are the gods how can they forget anything* to shout TRAINS coming your way!! people die (part of the game!!) zone back in and immediately say OH SHIT DAKOR I HATE YOUR é&quot;'(è!@ Bunches of retards!!!!!<br>
Instead of saying , ok can we talk this out ? could you AFTER you have done your CR , help us with Resses because we died of you ?<br>
Im very sure if Vendrix or whatever cleric they have along , Would have done so .They did it in the past , so why wouldnt they have done it now ?<br>
Anyways , Your MANNERS to some people (read uberpeople) REALLY need to change , because this way , you sure like hell aint going to have friends..<br>
<br>
 <br>
Oh, Destain and bubu , im not ASSKissing , and im NOT a future applicant .ill stick with the SWM forever.<br>

This is what I've seen from reading on this. One post from someone talks about how people should move into the zone instead of being scared to move away from it. Pretty sure it was someone from Da`kor that said it, yet you guys were pulling TO the zone according to other posts. So why not Go Camp the Spawn instead of pulling to a place that you have stated yourself that you KNOW is going to be trained.<br>
<br>
Lastly, if Dowd was there...hmm...enchanter...AE stun, back away and mez or however it is Enchanters handle extras. You kill named mob and Dowd does a quick mem blur and you all zone out and everyone is happy except those that are in the return path of the train, which would have been f'd anyway.<br>
<br>
Anyway, basically what I'm saying is just Admit that you Might have made a mistake with the fearing, whatever. Because it was, in all honesty.  You think I haven't been in similar situations? I've never seen stuff like that handled by using fear...fear has always been one of the BIGGEST no-no's in a dungeon.  Although I'm sure Hothgar got a Huge laugh out of it by his smart-alec sounding posts concerning it. Hell, I'd rather hear about you training the whole zone to the zone in to get VS at zone and solo than hear you try to defend this.</font><P><center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Dunes/7603/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="2" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="red">Ramierez D`Elerian Draegonis</i></b></font></font><img src="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Dunes/7603/mage.gif"><i><b><font size="1" face="Ariel Narrow"><font color="blue"><br>A Wizard's soul is forged in the crucible of magic.~~Antimodes of the White Robes.</i></b></font></font></center><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#666666><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uasotus007.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asotus007</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Veteran</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>94</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>10/28/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>1:00:45 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: I've seen elite, and boy is it ugly...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">They foooked up and made a bad tactiacl decision.

''Note to mindless asskissers like Mitch etc. who defend EVERY action by Da'kor, wanna know why you ain't in their guild dude? people don't respect people who kiss their ass, real world or otherwise. You aren't in their guild, never will be, get over it. Go suck up somewhere else assmunchers and let them defend their actions, they are big boys. ''<br>
<br>
Are you on CRACK!<br>
<br>
I suggest you go back and do a search on this board and look at one of the many, MANY, M A N Y viscous nasty and bloody flame threads between myself and Vendrix, Kzzern, Elwynn, Kerrol, Lieran etc etc etc<br>
<br>
They are about as nasty as any you'll find.<br>
<br>
Now let me tell you the difference between you and me, i can get over a problem i might have, i can then move on from past problems and get on with the people who i was mad at.  This means i can see both sides of a dispute and every person who knows me also knows that i call things as i see them.  In this case the initial post was a knee jerk response to a maybe inconsiderate action by a 'few' members of Da'Kor, i posted my opinion and i stick by it.  When you get to know people in a guild you realise things are not always so black and white.  I do not belong to the <br>
<br>
'bash the uber guild just because they are an uber guild'<br>
<br>
school of thinking, and anyone who does is a mental midget.<br>
<br>
Yesterday i had a situation where i was furious with members of a certain guild but rather than spout off i took some time to calm down and then talked with a few of them about it, guess what? no flame wars, no broken friendships, no harsh words.  You might want to try talking to people before you go spouting off such crap.<br>
<br>
Couple of other things<br>
<br>
My guild the Dawn Brigade treat me like fucking ROYALTY and my loyalty and committment to the guild plus the fantastic people there means i am not currently looking to go anywhere, be it Da'kor or anyone else.<br>
<br>
Which leads me to...<br>
<br>
And if you knew anything at all you'd realise that Da'kor would rather cover themselves in honey and roll around in wasps nests while simultaneously zapping themselves with cattle prods than have Mitch in amongst them, i know it, they know, the whole damn server knows it, except maybe you, so to think i'd kiss ass to try and get in is beyond stupid.<br>
<br>
Peace<br>
<br>
Mitch<br>
<br>
ps if i see your sorry ass in-game i will try not to drop multiple mobs on your thick head &lt;grins&gt;<br>
<br>
pps i'm not a 'dude', dude<br>

Since I'm sure what you all really wanted was a hearty flame... here goes.<br>
<br>
I think you should all kiss Dowdy and hug him many times for being nice and explaining himself. He is a nice guy and he doesn't deserve your crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You wave around &quot;respect&quot; like you know what it means - if you did, Jack, you wouldn't be posting stupid shit like that. What's the point of your post? To inform me and my guildmates that you think we're impolite and that you dislike us, and to (while you're at it) throw in some lamedicked insults possibly mixed in with the words &quot;elite&quot; and &quot;uber&quot; to make it look like you're making some sort of important philosophical statement about people and status? Take a number and get in line right behind Bob, the last guy whose group we trained, mob we KSed, dog we shot, spouse we accidentally urinated on, or whatever the hell it is you people bitch about. Maybe we're not thought of as greatly as other guilds... maybe it's because when lame shits like you get on our asses at every chance you get... we tell you to fuck off instead of giving you an apology you don't deserve? I think that's it!<br>
<br>
Oh and to whoever was talking about our 'reps'... you can take any perception of me and my guild you have, and shove it up your ass, because that's exactly how much any of us care. We give a shit what people we respect think of us, and *news flash* you're not one of them. Your first hint as to why? Shit spewed out of your mouth as soon as you opened it. If you expect politeness and respect, expect to give it. I got neither (god knows I wouldn't expect it from you gimps) and so you get jack shit too! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Have a nice day...<br>

 ready here it is. GUILDWAR! ask the GM (Guides) if you can do it with looting. i heard of sometimes GM giving special circumstances when two guilds want that in a guild war. no more talk. all action. you think you are better, you have something to prove, you want respect, go get it!<br>
  or maybe you don't care about what &quot;other people&quot; say about your guild, (yeah your to big for that) but accept the challenge. y chicken out? maybe you can kill trak (an artificial intel PC) but can you defeate another human which takes more skill then calculating damage/mana ratios, and counting down spawn times.  <br>
  my sulotion is simple.  less talk more action. bring it! and may the best and more organized group of people win the loot</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#666666><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthalanthasbrightspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thalanthas Brightspire</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Veteran</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>76</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>10/28/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>8:24:38 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: I've seen elite, and boy is it ugly...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Sigh.  Everybody makes mistakes.  I think this has been pointed out several times in this thread.  I wasn't in Karnor's (I hate that damned zone /rude Verix) but I think it's been said several times (in one of the very first posts of this thread, by vendrix) that people make mistakes, trains happen. <br>
<br>
I think you also would have gotten a different response from people had you posted in a different manner or spoken to them in game.  I guarantee they would have given you a 56 res and apologized had you given one of them a tell (and spoken to them without saying, &quot;you fucking uber dick!&quot;).  However, what do you expect when you come on here flaming like this?  For them to backtrack and say, &quot;oh, we're sorry&quot;.  There is no way that was going to happen, given the medium you chose to display your displeasure and the manner in which you did so.  You put them on the defensive purposely with the tone and language of your post(s).  They responded in kind.  <br>
<br>
You've called us &quot;elitist&quot;, but just look at your words.  You feel superior to our entire guild, it's pretty obvious (you even feel superior to those you've never met, pretty much stating &quot;guilt by association).  That's fine, I have no problem with people believing whatever they want to, but for god's sake, have some consistency.  Hold yourself to the same values you judge others by.  Perhaps, in terms of game skill you don't think yourself better but you have a holier than thou attitude that permeates each of your posts.  <br>
<br>
In fact, this is a pet peeve of mine.  People come in here blasting &quot;uber&quot; guilds saying they are &quot;elitist&quot; and then saying we in these guilds &quot;have no life&quot;, &quot;play 24/7&quot;, or &quot;are shitty people&quot;, etc.  Perhaps it's just me, but these statements smack of hypocrisy.  One moment you're saying we're elitist and the next your putting us down trying to make yourselves look better.  Think about it.  If you were truly the better person, you wouldn't come in here and post flames, you'd go about your business with the self satisfaction that you conduct yourself in (what you consider) a better fashion.<br>

<br>
While fighting a named mob (Knight of Sathir if I remember correctly) we got trained by some moron.  Now, we could have all zoned and lost a 1/2 dead mob that dropps some nice warrior weapons, or we could figure out something.  So I started tanting everything I could and ran it all back into the castle, disrupting several groups' pulls and training a few as well.  I felt kinda bad yea and it wasn't the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.. but we don't all think of the consequences of every action when we are faced with a situation.  <br>
<br>
I have also had similar thigs happen to me.. people pulling extras out of thier group and rooting them right next to my group.. monks/sk's pulling right up to me and seeing my pull and FDing and leaving me with the entire group.  Shit happens and no amount of flaming or ranting will change that.  Yell at them in /tells or /ooc or /shout and let that be the end of it.  <br>

You want a train? Rewind one year to Mistmoore and go sit on the receiving end of a Genneral Frostbane Paladin-Auto-Train.  Then come here and complain to me that the big bad trains are too scary for you.  It used to be that a good train was a true work of art.  Nowadays, there's no originality.<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with what happened that night.  It's merely a response to those people who complain about trains.<br>
