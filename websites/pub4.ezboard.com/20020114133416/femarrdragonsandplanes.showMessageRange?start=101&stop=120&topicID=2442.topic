<br>
you have never been on an MS raid or know the player abilities. You have no idea that they are the funnest things to do and that loot and victory comes second. You dont respect anything chuk unless it has your shit on it. I respect Magister. I may not agree with all the idiots in the guild and the ringmaster Jizzern but i still have respect. I know what it takes to kill the mobs in this game and what u need and it takes alot of time to organize it all. <br>
<br>
as far as player abilities go i own all of Magister so EAD man. and there u go with recruiting issue, *snores*. you guys bring just as many people to a raid as any other uber guild does. i know i know i know, &quot;i didn't say anything about the number of people, you did&quot;...stfu. You love to leave things wide open then trap the guy that points it out. That is spineless. Why dont u just be a man and come out and say things straight up. You post on these boards more than anyone so why dont u have the guts?<br>
<br>
as far as posting subtle potshots, thats all u got<br>
<br>
and let me shed a little reality on your ego. you guys claim that you do shit with low numbers and are all uber but in reality u just have better gear. better gear makes fights last longer and in turn makes it so u need less people. <br>
<br>
EQ requires no skill, just time. Throw 30 people at a mob enough times and they'll win soon enough. <br>

      I have always made it a point to stay out of these Magister/MS bashing threads.  I like way more people in your guild than I dislike and wouldn't put them in a position where they felt I didnt respect them because of their guild tag.  A friend is a friend no matter how he chooses to spend his time in game.<br>
<br>
      I am sorry you feel the need to burn bridges and trash what I considered to be at least an over all positive relationship.  <br>

<br>
some people felt this was a bad thing.  as bralan pointed out in his post (i'm borrowing the concept, not quoting him), people should not be sheep, should be allowed to say what they want to who they want whenever they want.  honestly, umoja had a couple people leave because they truly did not agree with that particular rule.  and that's alright, if you don't agree with something, then find something you do agree with, right?  <br>
<br>
the fact is, now, in magister, chuk does act differently than he did before.  but it wasn't a change in his character, it was simply a change in his environment.  being in a guild that allows him different freedoms (and i'm sure different restrictions), he responds differently to situations.  chuk is very confident, very arrogant, and has many other...questionable...characteristics.  everyone does, and if you think you're any better, take some time to review your own actions, dig up some dirt on yourself, because trust me, for every one thing you find, someone &quot;against&quot; you can find five.  <br>
<br>
personally, i have always liked chuk, he's been very good to me.  i don't agree with everything he is or does, and i am quite certain that he's probably done or said things to/about me that aren't &quot;good&quot;.  i'm alright with that, being far from perfect myself, i'm sure i can live with it.<br>
<br>
regarding the situation in question:<br>
<br>
dracon:  i totally understand what you are saying.  chuk was posting about a totally different topic than &quot;my guild (and by connection, myself) is so very much better than all the other guilds on my server!&quot;.  but i think what kani was actually talking about was the manner in which chuk said what he was trying to say.  you see, if he had said something along the lines of &quot;and so and so GM was great too...we once had an issue during which (fill in the blank items) were reported to have been given to (fill in ubermob), and he was quick to respond and handle the situation&quot;, i highly doubt anyone would have taken offense.  (forgive me, i don't remember the gm, items involved, or which creature it was, as they keep going back and forth, daggers, masks, dain, tormax...can't keep it all straight).  it is the derogatory statements about what could be any guild (MS just knows it's them because they were involved in the situation, whether an MS member was the guilty party or not is beyond me to say), that he shares a server with is degrading to the other guilds on the server...and let's face it, it is not an uncommon &quot;bully&quot; tactic to verbally bash others in order to make oneself look better.<br>
<br>
why do they care?  i don't think anyone cares what FoH or the other servers think of them, i think they care that an individual repeatedly goes off on his own server and guilds of that server.  i read kani as basically saying &quot;it's bad enough that you trash talk here, but why do you have to do it everywhere else too?  does it make you feel bigger and badder?&quot;.  you see?<br>
<br>
is it really that big of a deal?  i don't think so, but different things push different people's buttons.  <br>

As for chuk himself, well it makes me laugh to see him boasting about his skills as a player...this from someone who told me never to use Complete heal in a battle because the Casting time is wayyyy to long.<br>
<br>
Like Kanya I liked Chuk too, but he made some very personal visious attacks against me and my character (not my in-game character but my RL one) that I cannot forgive him for.<br>
<br>
He is the ONLY person I have ever had on ignore in over two years of playing this game.<br>

I have always been like this. as i stated earlier. i respect my guildmaster's wishes. when MS pulled that bullshit with flaming Grokx a while back i was livid. kanya asked me to stop talking about it. which i did.<br>
Being in Da`Kor and Magister i never really had the same restrictions as Umoja . <br>
<br>
I must say i welcomed the change. holding in your aggravation is not a good thing as it causes problems, even physical problems. I was miserable in Umoja towards the end, not becuase of not getting phat l00tz or not being uber enough but becuase of the people i was guilded with and the babyshit going on in guildchat. Kanya ,Raand, Popoi, Nenny and all the other old time Umoja members who i loved had all quit or stopped playing more than once a week. I was basically playing babysitter everytime i logged in. i was shutting guildchat of for periods of days and those days turned into weeks, finally i just said fuck this shit. im not ready to finish my eq career wiping a bunch of kiddies noses. <br>
<br>
Naele i dont like you . i didnt care for your comments to me when i joined DK back in january, and that put you on my permanent shitlist.<br>
<br>
Mcloude while im on the subject , you were a great member of Umoja. Nobody thought less of you when you quit or the circumstances behind it. None of us believed the accusations , big mistake was letting burble keep certain people on just so we could raid big things. It ended up biting us in the ass later on.<br>

Hes posting for a response, (for which I guess I am guilty <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but there is really no base for the crap that flows from his cock holster.  People know Chukzombi pre/post uber guild and know him to be totally different now.  He can deny it or he can accept it.  <br>
<br>
Don't play his juvenile game.  EQ is all he has man.  I went down to the gas station, and told Randy the attendant, I got up to &lt;insert&gt; hps fully buffed and have over &lt;insert&gt; ac, unfortunetly he still charged me $1.59 a gallon for gas.  <br>
<br>
See what I am saying, this is just a game and not a way of life, and in the end it doesnt really matter now does it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugilgamelavamar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilgamel Avamar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.theglobe.com/Zackulle/10PIXEL.JPG " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 494<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/01 5:10:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hahahah</span><hr size=1> Chuk has 2,100,503,000 posts.

He has his opinions and you can think he's full of more shit than a Streisand album if you want to. He's not going to admit he is, and if thats what you're looking for I think you're wasting your time.

<br>
Since way back when, I was always(you know, when I played) a big proponent of harping on MS about how many people they raided with, who they recruited, etc. I still stand behind everything I ever wrote, then…<br>
<br>
Based on my limited knowledge of what still goes on in the game, I have to say that line of demarcation is long gone. What do I mean? I mean the game, especially with the onset of Velious, calls for zergling tactics on more occasions than I can count. I’ve been privy to many a Magister raid at the Kael zone line where this person and that person racked up 2-3-5 corpses before said mob fell, same thing for MS. The argument of we kill things with less is a fossilized horse, beat it all you want… its showing no signs of effect.<br>
<br>
Did Da`Kor beat every uber-mob of yesteryear with at least 20% less people than MS, you bet your ass we did and always 3-weeks to a month before they even tried. That right there was the biggest, and most noticeable(at least to me) aspect of the way MS operated that I, personally, had issues with. They exhibited a total unwillingness to take on anything before my guild - that really bothered me. I actually had a conversation with an MS member who stated, in no uncertain terms, that they weren’t going to take on Sontalak until we beat him first. To me, that exuded gay and it made me think “get some fucking balls, guys.”<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, this was months ago and I'm sure things have changed. I think I even read that MS killed Sontalak first. Well, belated congrats you bunch of donkey-raping ass-pilots, and it’s about fucking time. Now come to DaoC and prepare yourself for a swift pummeling of biblical proportion, right after I kill Memn 3-4 more times.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00> /laughs at all the Magister peeps in crafted and what not. Whatever is loot I wonder?</font><br>
<br>
Was there a point to this, the most ambiguous comment I’ve read in days, other than a clever ploy to force a 440K signature pic of your ass onto my hard drive?<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00> For those of you interested Da`kor and FoH did get into a flame fest a looooong time ago.</font><br>
<br>
Ogmuk went to the FoH board, called them exploiters and lead them back here. We beat him into a coma… unfortunately he got better. We’ve all got our cyanide pills handy incase he gets loose again.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00> kanya! u and raand need to hang with ice in camelot!</font><br>
<br>
Don’t do it, they’re the biggest bunch of haters anywhere! On a separate note, I saw some guy running around named Rand. I followed him for 15 minutes cheering and waving, he logged soon after. I imagine he's in therapy as you read this.<br>
<br>
Kanibaal, that fucking cat weirds me out g’damnit!<br>
<br>
As for Chuk posting what’s on his mind, I would have let him take the ball and run with it on this one I think. Back in the day I would have been hitting refresh on this post faster than the A/B buttons in a game of Nintendo Track & Field.<br>
<br>
Flames are fun, I enjoy them more when I can take the support roll instead of the guy who tosses the first brick through your window of ignorance and stupidity. Rarely, if ever, did I ask people not to post(well, there was the instance of Dowd following up one of my best rants ever to hit the official EQ boards with a line containing, “I sick of reading retarded!"(sic)) and if I did it was because I was in a groove. Let people speak their minds, I don’t see anything you can win or lose by doing so(unless their name is Dowd, of course). <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

I have some friends in Magister who I have a lot of respect for. I have played this game for well over 2 years now, and just because I don’t troll the message boards looking to involve myself in every little tidbit of bullshit doesn’t mean I just fell off the banana boat yesterday. I know what’s up with people in the game for the most part. As for me “coming out of the woodworks to bash a guild” you’re sadly mistaken. You don't even know who I am. <br>
<br>
One thing I find to be pretty “Priceless” (as you say) is how many times Chuk has jumped onto posts to throw in his 2c worth just to bump it with his knowitall piece of input. Now its happening to him. That is what I found amusing. So no, I was not bashing any guild. I was not even bashing Chuk per se. Just finding a little amusement in the poetic justice of it all. <br>
<br>
P.S. No, I’m not the Nija from Magister. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
