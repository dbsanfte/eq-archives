Did you, or did you not, register for Selective Service?<br>

You must have.<br>

Did you not understand what it implied?<br>

Perhaps you were too young.<br>
<br>

Apparently.<br>

THEN LEAVE. Our borders are open, you're free to renounce your citizenship and go at any time. You're old enough now to read and understand such a simple agreement. But by remaining here, you imply agreement with our laws, and with the few responsibilities you are required BY LAW to uphold.<br>
<br>
If you choose to remain, with the full intention of defrauding our nation and our people, then I'd call you a traitor.<br>
<br>
And while I appreciate the thoroughness of your response, I'd like to point out that no amount of Randite rhetoric can cover up the absolute lack of integrity possessed by a draft dodger. <br>

Self-interest? I think in the old days, we just called that &quot;evil&quot;. But then I guess America really has changed since the days of its founders.<br>

If you fail to see that then you are more then ignorant. It was approved by a body of legislators that the American people supported. Since the &quot;majority&quot; approved it, you are bound by it unless you refute your status as a citizen and live abroad.<br>
<br>
How would our goverment function if the bank robber told the cops &quot;I don't think robbing banks should be against the law, because my personal beliefs override any of those of the majorities that wrote the law&quot;? <br>
<br>
Can you quickly see how that would lead to anarchy?<br>
<br>
And don't hand me anything about the British empire again because the reason why we fought against their authority was because we did not have representation in the House of Commons/Lords and felt we were being discriminated against in trade etc. You have representation if you vote, and no one is singling you out in respect to having to follow the law.<br>
<br>
Finally, I really don't care what you do. In every major conflict (even WWII) we have had those who refused to fight and disavowed themselves from our country. Just don't expect sympathy for your plight later when you can't return to the US or have to hide in fear evading the law for the rest of your days. <br>
<br>
This will be my last post. You can't reason with people who think the law doesn't affect them. You can only laugh your ass off when that attitude comes back to bite them in the ass.<br>
<br>
p.s. Next time a cop stops you for speeding, don't pull over. Just yell out the window that you don't feel the speed limit applies to you because you pay your taxes and because you had no say when it was created... <p><small><br><br><br>Ægishjalm eg ber milli bruna mjer.<b> - Icelandic Chant</b></small></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 651<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 8:04:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /bow</span><hr size=1> Triff:<br>
<br>
I'm not going to go into the whole cut and paste quote thing because you're not worth the amount of effort it would take to do so, just wanted to respond to a couple of things that got to me.<br>
<br>
A.  I would rather NOT fight alongside someone who is only concerned for himself.  He's too busy watching his own ass to watch mine.  I value someone who is willing to sacrifice himself to save others much, much more then some gutless, selfish brat.<br>
<br>
B.  No matter how many ways you paint it, you are a coward.  It makes me want to puke when I read your posts.  Justify your stance a million times, defend yourself in a million different ways, you are still a spineless coward and everyone who has read your drivel knows it.<br>
<br>
C.  Kytherion's right.  You signed up for selective service.  You are required BY LAW to fight if drafted.  If you don't want to honor our laws and fight for the PRIVELEDGE of living in the United States of America, then fucking leave.  And don't give me this bullshit about being forced to do what you don't want to do.  Makes you sound even more like a selfish brat every time you say it.  I, and most people, have to do things we don't want to do every stinkin day, but we do it because it is necessary.  It's part of life.<br>
<br>
And to all these strategic geniuses we have on our message boards, tell me this:  what is it you know that our joint chiefs, generals, admirals, etc. don't?  You say that standard military action isn't effective in this kind of battle when I hear on the news that leaders in the Pentagon say that ground troops will be very effective against our enemy.  So please, regale us with your military brilliance and tell us ignorant folk how it is YOU would do it?<br>
<br>
Just one final message to all those that don't believe in fighting for their country (and I hate to sound too redneck, but I am from the south <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ):<br>

You would have yourself be a tenant who refuses to pay his rent becuase he does not think he should.   Make sure you try to reason with the other 280 million Americans how you are better than them and should not have to put your life on the line to enjoy the same freedoms that rest of us may have to die for to keep sacred.<br>
<br>
You would rather sit at home and pat the soldiers on their ass when the come home and say &quot;atta boy!..Man I'm glad you kept me alive! I'm so fuggin important cause my cowardice drives me to self preservation!!&quot;  Sick man..you never learned a shred of honor, virtue, and caring.  You value yourself as the means to all ends, and hold that you are the highest reward possible in any outcome.  Therefore you must be proctected at all costs.  You know Triff..I would fight a war for my country..but specifically..not for you.<br>
<br>
The sad thing is..when this is all over..our soldiers will come home..some of them..and you will still be here...gloating over the fact that above all else you lived.  Your freedom will be intact, payed by a price that others have given so that you can lived safely in your vanity without regard to the fact that you failed to join a brotherhood of mankind, and rather put yourself above the fray since you appear to be destined for &quot;greater things&quot;...which in reality are nothing more than glorified attempts to conceal bitter yellow cowardice.  You appear to me..for lack of a better term to be what is worst in mankind.<br>

<br>
Considering I had absolutely 0 RL friends/aquaintances that were affected by this, my opinion should give you some idea of the spirit in which this country was founded.<br>
<br>
At the risk of sounding like a recruiting video...<br>
<br>
I would and will show up to the draft spit shined shoes with clean underwear and a crew cut if we instate a draft and I am called.  There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it, I am there, and I will be there showing all the honor and dignity that befits an American willing to stand up for the freedom that has been handed to me my entire life.  Considering I have lived my life with a silver spoon in my mouth thanks to the valiant bravery of our forefathers, I feel it is my duty, and every citizen's (who claims this country as their own) duty to uphold the ideals of our great nation, and that means fighting for the very freedom that you have had without cost for your entire life.  I am sorry, but taxes don't mean jack when you are talking about repaying your government for peaceful existance on your own soil for over 200 years (with the exception of the one attack on Pearl Harbor).  You pay taxes to build roads and bridges and keep up the day to day operations of the nations government so that your hometown doesn't end up looking like a scene from the movie &quot;Aftermath,&quot;  not as recompense for the freedom you have enjoyed your entire life.<br>
<br>
Think of all those men and women who have given their lives so that you can have the right to come to this board and cry that you don't want to go to war.  Honor those men and women by keeping their cause alive, do not let them have died in vain so that we could become a nation of spineless cowards that doom ourselves to destruction because we are too gutless to stand up and say, &quot;HEY! Knock off your crap, you're dealing with Americans and you are NOT going to get away with killing innocent people, ON or OFF our soil.&quot;  Show your children that it is nobler to fight for justice so that others can live in freedom, free of terror and fear.  Ask yourself, do you REALLY want to be cowering in a corner for the rest of your life afraid that the people who did this are going to strike again?  Do you want your children to have to?  Or do you want to rid that fear from the lives of all Americans?  You have been given a great gift, if a draft is issued, it is time to put up or shut up, do you want this freedom?  Do you want to live in a country that stands for dignity, honor, and peace?  War is not glorious, it is not to be romanticized, but if we do not fight for what we believe in, who will?  And why should they sacrifice themselves to give you, one who wouldn't stand up for yourself, not because you couldn't, but because you didn't want to, the peace of mind that comes with knowing that the perpetrators of this crime have been brought to justice? <p><a href=http://afflictionguild.com/scripts/member.x?username=Aphroditex&charactername=Aphroditex>Aphroditex Bubblefists</a></b>;  Serenity Z'Chaotic; Pickett Pocketts<BR>

Some people are forbidden by their religion to go to war -- for example, the Quakers.<br>
It takes courage to accept that before you harm another human being, you would let them kill you.  It takes even more courage to accept that this may mean the death of your loved ones.  This is why the USA offers the status of Consciencious Objector.  Some people know themselves well enough to know that they simply could not bring themselves to harm another human.  These people do not belong in the armed forces, but that does not make them cowards.<br>

wow.<br>
<br>
I've read this thread through with some interest and I'm not in the habit of contributing to rants.  But I'm going to this time.<br>
<br>
This is obviously a highly charged topic.  One that is difficult to argue no matter which side of the issues you are on.  Here are my thoughts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Draft Dodgers:  People refuse to fight when their country declares war for a variety of reasons including religious conviction, philosophical differences, self interest ... the two themes that I've seen mentioned here appear to point to the latter examples.  And the reality is, there is nothing to be said to them that will change their minds.  Personal attacks serve only to make them dig in their heels and defend their choice more adamantly.  <br>
<br>
The truth is either you see this as an attack on Americans and take it personally as an American.  Or you see it as an attack on the freedoms for which America stands and there fore on yours or your communities freedoms.  Or you see it as an attack on the United States as a disembodied symbol and establishment to which you have little or no connection regardless of your residence.<br>
<br>
How will you as an individual know there is enough proof to 'go after' the individuals or organizations responsible?  I don't think you can.  Among other things, you aren't willing or capable of collecting the evidence, compiling it, and drawing conclusions.  That is part of what we expect our government and its resources to do for us.  We elect representatives and a president and ask them to review the information placed before them and to take appropriate actions.  Part of being a citizen of a democratic rebublic is trusting those who we have put in power to do the right thing, at the right time.  Does this mean we should blindly follow or grant them carte blanche?  No.  Does this abrogate our responsibility to pay attention and be as informed as possible about what is happening in the world?  Of course not.  But we also should avoid jumping to conclusions about what should and should not be done and how we will or will not support it.  The point can be argued ad nauseum during this period of fear and anger, but its all wind in the dark until all the evidence is in and a decision has been made.  I doubt The United States will do anything dramatic without the support not only of her own citizens but the international community.<br>
<br>
What IS the correct action to take?  Well, actually this is an unecessary question.  We want Justice.  We want the individuals and organizations responsible to be punished.  We want those who supported and harbor the guilty to also suffer for protecting those who have murdered innocents.<br>
<br>
The issue really turns on the question of collateral damage.  How much are we willing to accept?<br>
<br>
Do you really believe that our government or the people who support it want to murder innocents in order to bring the guilty to justice?   I don't.  But I am aware that minimizing the possiblility of causing the death of those who are themselves victims of terrorists or innocent bystanders means that justice will not be a swift as my anger would like it to be.  My thirst for vengence is dissatisfied by the possiblility that some of the perpetrators of this atrocity might get to live a long while, and that some, as sick as it makes me feel, some might even get away with it, and pass their social illness on to others.  However I have to believe that the majority will be punished.<br>
<br>
Another reality is that the world is not a perfect place and never has been.  As great as the United States is, as many friends as we have in the International community, we cannot deny the fact that there are also those who hate us with a fervor that burns like the fires of Hell.   And this past week - we were shaken from our complacency and forced to recognize this to be true.  What we cannot and must not allow these terrorists to do is to fracture our unity or break our resolve to persevere and prosper. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
