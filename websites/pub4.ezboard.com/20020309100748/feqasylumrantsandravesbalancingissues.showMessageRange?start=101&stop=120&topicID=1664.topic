<br>
Veeta had opportunities to clarify the inconsistencies and (in the literal sense of the word) incredible stories, and chose to instead to react to people who were criticizing writing ability.<br>
<br>
Veeta never adequately addressed the following two issues:<br>
<br>
1.  If all of Veeta's gear dropped to the ground as a result of trade, then how could Veeta possibly have *nothing,* since in order to the gear to drop, the inventory slots *must* have been full.<br>
<br>
This issue was never addressed at all by Veeta.<br>
<br>
2.  Veeta stated that s/he (? not sure ?) was in EC fighting Orcs with no gear whatsoever.  When questioned as to where his/her back up gear was, the response was &quot;I'm not in some uber guild where I have plat up to the gills.  How the hell could I have back up gear?&quot;  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, that just simply does not hold water with me.  At all.  I can not beleive that somebody could get to level 30 as a tank who cannot heal and cannot bind without figuring out at some point that it is a good idea to have a backpack with a stack of water, a stack of food, a stack of bandages, a crappy sword, and a few pieces of armor for those times that you just can't get a CR and need to fight your way back to your body.  This is something I figured out on my own as a Level 7 Dorf Pally who got tired of running back to the south side of Butcherblock naked after getting nailed by Corflunk and/or Zarchoomi for the second or third time.  I just don't buy it that a tank would have never learned that and still gotten to that level in the game without being twinked/PLed (which he stated he was not).<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with writing ability, or lack thereof, from my point of view.  It has to do with a refusal to treat the people you are asking to help you with respect by answering their questions.  And it has to do with someone creating a series of tales containing so many contradictions and consistencies that one would have a hard time locating a wheel of Swiss cheese with fewer holes in it.<br>
<br>
You may choose to frame this as a &quot;people are being asses to Veeta because he has crappy spelling and grammar.&quot;  I know that you are a nice guy to newbies - you once paid a starting, untwinked character of mine a lot more plat for a stack of bone chips than I expected to ever receive from anyone, and much more than I had asked for.  But in this case, I think the situation is &quot;Veeta is being an ass to the Lanys community by trying to scam, and doing a poor job of it.&quot;  And what he's doing is making harder for folks like my untwinked necro to send a tell to someone &quot;Hi.  I have some bone chips for sale.  Would you be interested in buying?  If not, sorry to bother you.&quot; and get treated with any sort of respect by a higher level character.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure that you see it differently, but from my point of view, characters like Veeta are make it harder for the real newbies and casual players and people who need help to be treated with respect by experienced players.  And that makes for a weaker server community. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

<br>
Case one. Veeta's 1st post:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;recently lost all my gear too someone on EC i was transferring it back to my main and my inverntory was full and i didnt know and it all dropped and people picke dit...&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
She's playing the EC scam card here. About how she lost her shit there, and trying to arouse sympathy from this perspective. <br>
<br>
What he/she told Glade Knights:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;another Officer was looking for Veeta's corpse in OT (which, he claimed, was the reason he had no gear):&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm. Thats not even the same continent. Thats case#1<br>
<br>
Case 2. Again, her first post:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;someone steals alll my stuff lol i almost felt like crieng if you can help with anything please eamil me thank you&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok. the emotional card again. Irritating and stupid by this point, but that doesn't matter. <br>
<br>
NOw, once again, the story told to her guild:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Oh well, i dont care, i'll just let it rot and re-equip it later, thanx for looking&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm. wow, reaction is COMPLETELY different. really doesn't care. <br>
<br>
This is 2 cases already. But, just in case thats not enough for you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;im a lvl 30 war and recently lost all my gear too someone on EC i was transferring it back to my main&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok. stop right there. NOw, she was transefering it back to her main? Now, this is either one of 2 things:<br>
<br>
a) she was on her warrior in EC tranfering to her main. So, the warrior isn't even her main character, meaning that, in any case, she's begging for items for her damn mule. <br>
<br>
b) she was transferring to her main character, the warrior. Now, hold on. Her warrior is level 30, and she's transfering new stuff to him. Somehow though, she was able to get to lvl 30 with the warrior, without this &quot;good stuff&quot;. Question, how is it that she had been able to level to 30 with the equipment on this character so far, but now is no longer able to do anything with her? INteresting perdicament no?<br>
<br>
Case#4. Spelling. Looks at the difference in the way he/she posts here, and on the Glade Knights boards: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;well thank you jeka my god there are some nice people left on this server lol and for who ever said i should trust tsomeone i dont know with trans that not even what happened i was trans for someone else and my inventory was full of bags but the slots n bags wer not open and i did not realize this and the bags of M&lt;Y gear dropped and a possible of 167 people in EC kinda hard to shit list them all dont you think?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
and there:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;My char name is veeta lvl 30 warrior halfling i am in need of a guild that i will be able to raid with in a few more levels in search of a appropraite surounding i like to be respected as do i respect others In real life im 18 years old Male joining the marines soon ingaged and employed i know 1 of your guildie i grouped with her through various levels name is Badory<br>

<br>
More lies there.<br>
<br>
Hell, if you want, I can also point out that he's living in LA, going to high school and has a piece of shit RL; that we don't know him. In the post to the Glade Knights, he is an 18 year old employed male going to the Marines. Hmm, Bad High-schooler to employer Marine; wow, what shocking new developments.<br>
<br>
I don't know about you, but this sounds more like a 40 yea-old, basement-dwelling, no-life loser. I think Abysmul gave the right analogy in that Anathae; trans-sexual cry for attention post. I'm with Some Merchant on this one, don't come back.<br>
<br>
P.S.: that enough proof for you?<br>

Seriously, though, I only have access to the message boards for a couple of hours a day during the work week, since I can't look at them from work, when I'm sleeping, or when I'm playing DAoC or EQ (I only have one puter).  So a lot of time, I'm reading and responding to 18 hours worth of posts, long after most people have read and responded. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

<br>
I think she covered it quite well for herself actually.  If someone is slamming you for no other reason than to slam and make fun of someone's writing typically this is the type of response you will see from someone.  As I said, typically one would not be excited about giving someone the most accurate information when told to &quot;fuck off&quot; for no reason.  However she did give apt response in my opinion, not that it matters after the way she was flamed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1.

<br>
Possibly?  /shrug, maybe she did it in multiple trades before realizing that she was losing it all.  We just don't know.  And frankly, I wouldn't be that compelled to say it on a board when most of the people here are hell-bent on not believing anything she says based on assumptions that she lies.<br>

That's just ridiculous IMO.  I can count maybe 30 tanks/melee that do not have backup gear in their bank other than maybe a sow potion/invis potion off the top of my head.  Other than that it's just not necessary.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It has to do with a refusal to treat the people you are asking to help you with respect by answering their questions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Again, she was told to fuck off and teased constantly after TWO POSTS of asking for help, nothing in those first posts said anything negative to anyone specifically.  She has not recieved respect, so that's probably why the majority of the people that posted here are not getting any from her.<br>
<br>

Secondly, the Officer was already helping her. He was already looking around, and only after 5 minutes already or so, he said he didn't care.<br>
<br>
That told a few things, honest. <br>
- He didn't care about the effort involved that we were trying to extend. Why? I don't know. Veeta never told us why. Heck, the Officer that was looking had a Cleric alt in the zone who could perform a res when the corpse was found (provided it was not yet beyond the res timer).<br>
- He didn't care about the items on it. Frankly, I am always trying to retrieve my corpse, I have been doing so since level 1 whenever I had a corpse. I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> left it to rot. Why didn't Veeta care about the items? Because begging for new gear would be easier??<br>
<br>
The equipment a level 30 Warrior should have, should be more than reason to retrieve, no matter where the corpse is. Especially when someone else is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> already in the process of helping there</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
He was also begging over guildchat. To have people join him to go to Rathe Mountains and kill Hill Giants for cash, and to acquire new armor. Right at that moment groups were forming to head into the City of Mists for a guildraid, and we told Veeta as such, several times. The few members we had elsewhere were either busy or not able to help in RM because they were even lower level than Veeta was.<br>
<br>
Despite being told several times that we could not jump to his aid right away, he said he was being ignored and not given an answer. Also, when eventually our Guildleader spoke to him, he several times ignored the tells sent to him - and trust me, two lines of purple text scrolling past your chat screen are hard to miss. He wasn't AFK or anything, since at one such ignored tell, he made a guildsay about something unrelated a few seconds later.<br>
<br>
When asked why he didn't simply ask for help on our forum, he first told he could not do so, since the password wouldn't work. Yes, weird issue with  IE 6.0 and Medium Security (the default), if you don't have the latest security patch from MicroSoft.<br>
<br>
But we also have a General Chat, which doesn't require a password and he could have posted there just fine. When asked why he had not posted up there, and went straight to the Lanys Forums to beg (even though our guildrules forbid as such), he said &quot;I dunno&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't mind helping people. But when I find that two weeks later the items I donated are rotting away on a corpse, .. well, that doesn't make me happy at all. Also, disrespecting the guildrules is something that annoyed people in our guild. Especially since he persisted when told not to. <p><br><A Href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=30878"><IMG
