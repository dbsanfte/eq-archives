If you're too lazy to change your hot keyed auction, well then you're just a lazy fuck. heres the story.....<br>
Thanks to a druid named Jarramax (I think? - sorry) took pity on my lame ass, he ported me to WC so I could run to the Rathe Mts thru Ro. I had spent every last plat on faction, with the exception of 5, for a port from said druid. (He also took pity on my lame ass in Gfey after I died, accidently attacking the cleric after he started to walk away)<br>
Now, being a dorf pali and being my 1st char (real love/hate relationship, cant git rid of him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), i only have a 70 agi <br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
move<br>
<br>
real<br>
 <br>
<br>
slow.<br>
<br>
I'm in the tunnel, running (crawling?) thru to the Rathe Mts to see thomas with nothing in my pockets or in my packs except 2 things:<br>
1) a pair of cyclops skulls and<br>
2) various do-dads that i've picked up along the way. (I cant resist those skels that just seem to wander in front of my sword blade)<br>
I see an /auction for SOWs for donations at the tunnel entrance. I think to myself: &quot;great! i have a little to donate, I could really use a SOW for that run thru Ro and the Feerott!&quot; <br>
so - theres this ogre shaman i ask him for a SOW. in the trade window, I place 16gp, a lightstone, 2 MQ cat pelts and nearly a full stack of bonechips (maybe 14 or 16?). and I press trade. then I wait. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and I wait. <br>
and do you know what he says to me? Im sure you've already guessed it. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Shrekk says: &quot;is that it?&quot;<br>
yea, you dumb ass. thats it. was the trade button pressed, and my name not green? how long you been playing this god damn game, you fuck nuts? was I your 1st ever customer? <br>
Did I break you little punk-ass shaman cherry? <br>
or maybe not, cause you thought that a 'donation' consisted of several plat minimum and someone following you around like a fucking little puppy dog for the rest of the night  graciously typing <br>
/em kneel   when ever you desired. yea, you dumb ass, that was it, from a paladin and a part time PLAYER who thinks 300pp is a lot of cash. yea, that was it, from a paladin who doesn't drop his cp when he has too much, who values the time spent playing and banks what he can, when he can. yea that was it, from a paladin who was broke after spending all his money and selling some of the items he earned, to finance starting his Ro armor quest at level 22.<br>
So to you, Shrekk, the next time you auction something, god damn it, mean it. because if your too lazy to change your hotkey, or use that big white strip of plastic in front of you, with the little buttons on it (i.e. keyboard) to type something meaningful, dont be suprised when you really DO get a donation. and if you cant deal with that my friend, shut your god damn, cum stinkin cock-holster, and move out smartly.<br>
<br>
Taeuther, Dwarf<br>
Humble servant of Brell<br>
<br>
p.s. what the fuck kinda name is Shrekk? did you see that movie, about green ogre, one too many times? I bet you own it on DVD, too. does your mother let you watch it after you play EQ? I bet she STILL makes you go to bed before 8 o'clock though, right? <br>
<br>
<br>
p.p.s. I just want to thank people like Gwangmus and Aryk, both players who helped me obtain the ingredients I needed for the completion of these quests, for giving up their time to help. and that 44th lvl paladin in Q-town doing his soulfire quest, sorry - I couldnt pronounce your name, I sure as hell cant remember it now! LOL <br>
thank you all for your help.<br>

<br>
And no, Tae, I'm not laughing at you.  I think it's sort of lame for people to /auction SoWs.  There are tons of kind people who will give you one for free.  In fact, I often get SoWed without even asking for it.  I have no trouble with a true newbie trying to make a little money by taking donations for SoWs, but people who make a business out of it are a different ballgame.<br>
<br>
So this putz /auctions SoWs for &quot;donations.&quot;  And you give him . . . a donation.  BRILLIANT!!!  He must have totally freaked.  I think I may start carrying around some fish scales and rusty daggers and ruined bear hides and orc picks to give to those people.<br>
<br>
Again, I'm not making fun of you, Tae.  The stuff you gave that putz is actually worth more than the amount he would have considered an &quot;acceptable&quot; donation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unuzumwitchdoctor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nuzum Witch Doctor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/15/01 7:19:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Donation you call that a donation</span><hr size=1> Shit I would have laughed at you, there was no:<br>

As for the skins, sure good gesture but once again where is the meat, you give me your trash and walk away fat and happy.  16gp man that is a sweet donation (no sarcasm intended).<br>
<br>
Its nice to see some people actually donate, Its not quantity or quality that is the donation its the thought that counts.<br>
<br>
Kudos to you for realizing a donation is a donation, shrekk gives us all bad names.<br>

<br>
The inflation is largely due to people leveling and forgetting that Level 35+ money is not the same as level 1-25 money. <br>
<br>
I remember my first character was almost level 10 by the time she could put one PP in the bank. She had to spend every CP she earned by selling cat pelts and Patchwork armor on her wizzie spells. <br>
<br>
For someone starting out as an honest to god new player and not a twink what he put in that trade window represented a lot of money. <br>

Most of the people that stop me when I'm running somewhere, and as for a SoW or SLN will throw at least 5pp up in the trade window.  They've learned the value of my mana, and my time.  HOWEVER,  I NEVER take donations for buffs, SoWs or heals.  And I've NEVER auctioned, shouted or OOC'd the infamous, &quot;SoWing for donations, send tell&quot;, or whatever it is now.<br>
<br>
In my younger days, I always offered to pay for SoWs.  Although, at the lower levels, I never had much to offer.  I still don't mind paying my own way, and offering whatever I have for the persons time and mana.  But, if you stand there, offering to do it for &quot;donations&quot;, be lucky you don't end up with meat, bone chips, or other crap that you have to go sell for the coin.  If you want COIN, advertise COIN.  I'll just make sure that when I see you when I'm on with my alt, I avoid you like the plague.  I'd rather WALK my ass across the zone that have to deal with people like that.<br>
<br>
The huge arguement now is about the mana thing.  &quot;It doesn't cost anything but mana to TP&quot;.  Hm.... I'll argue that one with you.  What about the time you're taking away from MY time leveling or doing my epic or whatever, to TP your ass?  It's not JUST MANA.  It's my time.  And, you know what?  Some of those port spells cost me almost 30pp.  And when you're buying 16 spells when you hit a new level, that can add up. <br>
<br>
So yes, if you're going to send me a tell asking me to stop what I'm doing and port you somewhere, the least you can do is offer to pay for it.  Chances are, I won't take the donation, but for you to offer it, is to show me that you understand the value of my time and mana.<br>
<br>
Point is, a donation is a donation.  If you don't specify what you want, or offer a price list, you could end up with a big huge bear turd.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.sons-of-tao.50megs.com/pictures/YANESIG.JPG" border="0">

Hey, I was young and needed money.  But not much after that, I'd just sow people for free when they asked (I said asked, not &quot;d00d sow me plz&quot;).  If I was hangin out in EC and someone around me asked for sow, I'd give it to em, no big deal.<br>
<br>
But, for some reason, whenever I was playing a twink, I could never, ever get a sow in that stinkin zone.  I'd die in CT or LGuk or somewhere and, being bound in Freeport, I figured that I'd probably get a sow with so many people being in EC.  Such was hardly ever the case.  I'd ask in say at the tunnel entrance if someone could please sow me for a corpse run, then I'd ask in /ooc.  9 time out of 10, I'd have to run back to my corpse slowly.  Yes, I checked the zone to make sure there were druids, shamen, high enough rangers there, but no luck.

i can't tell you how many corpses i have located in DL from lowbies porting in headed to lake of ill omen, and die along the way and have no idea where their corpse is, do i charge them? hell no, locating a corpse takes none of my cash, and if someone needs help, i can take time out from killing shit to go help him, it's not like i can't find another group when i am done... <p><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/tn2/ariakkas/lidan.jpg" border="0">

I have never once auctioned to sow for fee or donation (you will often hear me shouting it for free when dead somewhere) .. if someone asks me while i am standing around.. I sow, talisman, and prolly buff a lil.. what ever is up, and never take a donation.  Unless it is from some guild that has pissed me off at some point in my EQ Life.<br>

<br>
Porting is a little different and that is not plat determined.  Some of us arent the fastest zoners around and porting can be a problem.  More importantly is I will not usually run to pick you up in qeynos to port you with escort to Fp.  No matter how much you offer me.<br>
<br>
It's not about plat ... It's about time.<br>
<br>
If it doesnt involve zoneing or running across the world it should almost never be refused ... and never be charged for.<br>

SoW is one of the lwoest cost spells we get.  I dont even notice my mana bar moving anymore when I cast it.<br>
<br>
I love seeing people offer stuff when I cast it on them.  I like when there's several plat, or they take the time to offer me whatever crappy items they have in exchange for me taking time out of what I'm doing to make thier lives easier.<br>
<br>
It reasures me that the effort is appreciated.<br>

I must complain a little though just because I have a Mouth and a Cigarette is not in it atm but listen to this hehe. I got a request for a rez ( 90% one) so I tell the group that I am in that I will brb in a ferw min since they were selling and splitting cash. I would never leave active group. So I was thinking..... hmmm do the rez gate back and all be set. Well little did I know that I was going to have to be ported all over to do this. First port was DL. then we had to run to BW. then all the way through BW getting aggro I may add... to the Chardok zone in, where the Body is NOW told to me after we already ported over there. The body was to be at the zone in... so in we go to chardok. No body.... so then we have to fright INTO chardok a ways andfinally get to Corpse.....  about 10 min later INSIDE Chardok. So I do rez, and we get aggro, imagine that. aggro in a 45+ dungeon... sighs.... we all die again, and I am taken back to bind spot.... I have to wait there about another 15 Min to get port back over to get body.... once we get back we finally get bodies back to zone so that I can rez after we had to get a necro to summon them, ( cost me 100 PP) so I get ready to do rez.... AND FUCKING SHIT I LOST MY LVL BACK TO 48 AGAIN. So then I tell them that I can not do the 90% rez atm since I lost lvl and best rez that I can do is 50%, is that ok... OH HELL NOOOOO! They want lvl 49 + rez that is the main reason that I was there. Needless to say I finally got myself a 56 rez and REDINGED back to 49..... so I then rezzed them. 5 PEEPS get 49+ rez.  they all say thank and the Druid that ported me over gave me 21 PP for donation and told me thanks. What kinda of shit is that. sighs... I mean very very very seldom do I even charge for a rez but I figured at as a 49+ cleric with less than 500 Pp in bank it is about time to start, Then again with donations as this I might as well do it for free, not to mention the trouble of getting 1/2 way across the planet and running 2 zones, dying one, loosing lvl, paying 100Pp for getting my Corpse Summoned and another 150 Pp to the 56 cleric that rezzed me to get lvl back. GRRRRRR sorry guess I am frustrated. :&gt;(). Any just thought I would gripe some. GRRRRR. thanks and post here.... overall Income made from this &quot;simple rez&quot; was NEGATIVE 129 PP in the hole :&gt;(P) is that bad or what <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Goodfellow 50th
