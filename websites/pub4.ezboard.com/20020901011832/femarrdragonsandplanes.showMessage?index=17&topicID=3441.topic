<br>
I have a few issues to bring up; and since its already here in Rants..might as well continue it.<br>
<br>
<br>
"First of all remember Max isnt the only officer in DG. All officers work together and the subject of your removal was discussed before it was carried out."<br>
<br>
This is all good and wonderful, really it is.  Maybe the officers should have actually informed him his crimes before being booted? Seems kind of on the sorry side; actually more on the fvcked up side. I can respect any guild that boots a player for being casual when its a hard core raiding guild.     Maybe the next victim will get told his/her crime before being disbanded.. <br>
<br>
But the wierd thing is, when Elnots plays...I never ever see more than 20 members of DG on...most of the time I see them in the morning. Should the people that play in the evening be booted as well? Isnt their playtime inconsistent to the rest of the guild?<br>
<br>
As for his leveling time, it took me awhile to get from 56-60. Ask any members of my guild. They use to razz the hell out of me for it..but I made it. Elnots has been logging in and looking for a group every night that I am on; and if I wasnt living in Vex Thal at the moment I would be there helping him out. Why you ask?. Because he is a friend and a former guildmate..and guildmates help each other out...<br>

<br>
Second off, if someone sat down and talked with me about the things brought up here, you not uber enough, you need to find another guild, then my current anger level would have been significantly reduced and I prolly wouldn't have come here to rant about it.  <br>
<br>
But instead of that I guess someone must have said, disband him whenever you feel like it.<br>
<br>
I don't get it, aani you said you discussed it, but only when Max was being an @#%$ and I defended myself did he say, HA take this!<br>
<br>
And Aamrie brings up a valid point imo, I have about 20 screenshots *sontalak, VS, lodizal, phin, RF, CT, Inno, etc etc.* of raids that I've been on within the past 4 months with DG. And all within my play time, as in, I help the players in my play time. <br>
<br>
And as well as my level, I don't sit in EC auctioning @#%$, I don't go afk for hours at a time, but I have 123 playing days. That's time spent trying to level, or raiding with friends/guilds.   <br>
<br>
Don't gripe me out because I'm not at your level, I spend all sorts of evenings being LFG all night because no guild groups want someone below 60.<br>
<br>
Which brings up an instance with a certain rogue in DG who wanted to make a group in CT, I asked to come along and he said sure, but ignored me as well did his whole group when all the other level 60's showed up and went off to kill oozes or lizards or what not. I wish they would have just said something like, I need to find someone higher..<br>
<br>
And twice I was told I was nothing but an EXP sponge and didn't want to be in their group, AGAIN with DG members, ask Sylendria if what I said is true there.<br>
 <br>
I'm sorry I was not l33t enough to stay with DG, and I am positively sure that Max disbanded me only because it was talked about and decided best. If you read my first post you'll see that what you say and what he did just go hand in hand..... *cough*<br>
<br>
Or it could just be a cover up to save face, either way that was wrong how you did that stuff Aani, and to think I didn't charge you officers for TL's.. with the respect you give me here in defense of Max's actions in the way he did things, I should of just been an ass, would have had the same effect it seems, be nice, considerate, helpful, get booted. Be rude, selfish, jerkoff, get booted.<br>
<br>
Guess it all comes to playing time then, did you think to ask me if I could have given someone some account info to play my character at raids? I have money problems, I have to work, in all my free time I play EQ, so do alot of EQ players, but you booted me cause I myself don't play as much as you'd like..<br>
<br>
<br>
I could give you three good examples, but come on, you all know people that give others their account info so they can be present at raids or just whenever needed.<br>
<br>
So in closing, you're excuses for keeping me disbanded blow, and you're trying to cover Max's ass for him. That's all I'm really trying to say in this reply. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4188<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/27/02 9:06:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3441.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DG rant</span><hr size=1> In all reality you got booted, suck it up, move on and deal with it, it's not your guild someone else who &quot;owns&quot; the guild must not want you in it. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6929">Rolelen Dwarkarn - 59 Myrmidon </a><br>

<br>
Elnots I'd just sit back and chill, move on to another guild, it's pointless trying to get anything out of a guild thats booted you, becuase you did wrong in some way (even if this isn't true on your eyes).<br>
<br>
My advice to you would be to steer clear of euro guilds, trust me you'll be happier in the long run (I live in England, so technically I'm European, hehe although that may be in doubt), American guilds are great, infact americans are all kinda fun, bit like big dumb puppies just out for fun and to catch that stick.<br>

<br>
Big enough to raid but majority knows RL comes first, great leadership, great members, lots of teamwork and a great place to call home!<br>
<br>
There's all kinds of guilds out there Elnots to suit different play styles. There's small guilds, big guilds, uber guilds, mini uber guilds, guilds that allow freedom of speach over guildchat, guilds that don't allow freedom of speech over guildchat, guilds with level limits and guilds without level limits, etc...<br>
<br>
All of the above are good type guilds if its what one is looking for. Uber is no better than casual, casual is no better than Uber. If you don't play much and your in a guild that plays hard your not gonna be happy with them an vs versa.<br>
If you are a player that likes to play hard, raid 24/7 and see all you can see in a short period of time and your in a casual guild, that won't work for someone either.<br>
<br>
You just have to figure out what you are looking for in a guild and go from there. Its no secret that DG is a raiding guild with pretty strict rules that point in that direction. Its all well and good that you have friends there, but if you don't fit the needs of the guild, take being deguilded on the hip and move on.<br>
<br>
I think the officer in one of the earlier post sounded honest as to the reasons. Don't try to make it out to be more than it is.  <p>Caelie<BR>

<br>
<br>
While Grinda an I weren't exactly close, I do agree with her on this. I still remember back when I was new to DG, the then officers tried to make it a point that raid gathering time was soft capped at 20 minutes. If you weren't there or runnin, ya got left behind an had to make yer own way as all guild porters would be occupied. This was a ways back though, back before Ayron left for DAoC...(btw, he ever come back an visit anymore?).<br>
<br>
The point is this, the raid guilds are known, the names are common knowledge. Despite a bit of differences in the prerequisites, many are the same across the board. High play time and solid play time are biggies when looking at recruiting new members, as well as retaining current members. Ability to play your class blind folded if you must, also helps<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  aka, ability to skillfully handle your class when required.<br>
<br>
I'm just thanking everyone in MF right now for giving me the chance to sort everything out in my life as far as work and what not, first; while raiding with them as I'm sure they see, only casually.
