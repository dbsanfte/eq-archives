<br>
Indasha was the raid leader i found him to be selling the white scale from the raid in EC for 80kpp. He stated something about everyone knew in advance that the first scale to drop was to go to his friend who was post 52 bard who has now left EQ. Indasha states that everyone knew that he was profiting from this deal and agreed to allow him to make the profit and help him raid anyway.<br>
<br>
I didnt have my chatlog running so i had to take pics of the chat in game about his auction ill post them asap or give me tell in game to have them emailed to you. dsenier@bellatlantic.net<br>
<br>
I welcome all input on this matter but it looks like we got a Con man doing business on raids to me. <p><img border="0" src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~dsenier/dsbanner.jpg" width="300" height="225">

<br>
Second, I would like to clarify my reason behind the scale. Initially I had planned the raid to obtain a White Dragonscale Cloak. I did not state this on the rules. I then received an offer from a fellow player in advance for the scale, set at 50k. I figured a bard would benefit more from this, and I would also get the cash to buy a cloak. The raid came and went, I got the scale, but was unable to contact my customer. I then found out he had left EQ for DAoC, two days after the raid. To my knowledge his account was canceled. I forgot about it for a while, thinking perhaps he would come back. A month after the raid I decided he was NOT coming back, so I began attempting to sell the scale. Saturday morning 912/20) around 2 AM EST I receive a tell from a rogue Xaell asking how I got the scale. I explained in full that I led the raid, and the rules were pre-established. I was then essentially told I was a &quot;con man&quot; for deceiving my fellow raiders into thinking the scale was randomed. I explained the RBB tradeoff, and he says &quot;What if RBB had not dropped?&quot; Among other what ifs were &quot;What if scale had been the only loot?&quot; &quot;What if only 1 scale had dropped?&quot; I laugh at this. TWO SCALES dropped. End of story. That and the horn went to two very lucky bards (to Ashreyl I apologize). All three bards and the other raiders came with the full knowledge of the rules. When we entered perma i restated them. At the buffhall I restated them again. And again I shouted the rules just before charge. Anyone on the raid who did not know would have had to have been either an idiot or AFK very often and at very innopportune moments.<br>
<br>
I feel no further need to explain myself. I ask you, raiders, to post here explaining that you knew the rules beforehand. I do not feel that anyone was conned, and this whole point should be proven moot.<br>

It doesn't look to me like Indasha was setting this up for a con IMO.<br>
<br>
Though I personally do not agree with &quot;calling&quot; scales for the White Dragonscale Cloak as I see it as exceedingly rude to screw a bard out a very rare drop for their epic....Indasha did state it beforehand that the first scale was called.  The one great thing about pick-up raids is -- if you don't like the rules, don't attend and run your own.<br>

<br>
You asked... Im posting... your story doesnt stick or match with your reasoning of holding that scale, it never did.  You said at one point it was for the cloak, then you said it was for a bard friend, then the cloak, then the bard.  So, IMHO... You're full of shit.  You changed your story and it still doesnt make any sense... if you were going to sell it to buy the cloak and the buyer isnt available why not just get the cloak?  Its very simple to get once you have the scale.  By not doing so you're just proving that you never really had intentions of making/getting a cloak... you just want to sell the scale to make a mad amount of plat.<br>
<br>
But... you led the raid... regardless of what you do with the scale you <b>did</b> make it known that the first went to you by default.  So frankly no matter what you do with it is your business... it just doesnt look good =/  So the issue this guy is having IS NOT the fact that you held the scale, its the fact that you decieved the raiders with your reasoning behind it.<br>

If you <i>were</i> going to do the cloak because you needed it, but then blah blah blah bull shit about bard and your greed for money, why dont you do the scalecloak quest, wear it and STFU?<br>
<br>
instead you are going to reinforce the fact that anyone other than bards are assholes because they only want to profit off an epic item by sell the scale/cloak. Leaving people who want to wear the cloak, sol.<br>

I personally do not feel this type of person belongs leading Emarr raids or having any say in them.<br>
<br>
Indasha orginal idea was not fulfilled as he said the bard that he was selling the scale to for profit thanks to the "generous raiders" (who didnt know he was selling the scale to said bard) this bard has now left the game, as per Indasha. Indasha has a responsibility to get back in touch with all raiding member that would have true use for the scale and random it between them to get back in Emarr's good grace's. Indasha you do not deserve to profit from this item you conned people into your scheme and your making all the profit off a broken deal do right or be gone. <p><img border="0" src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~dsenier/dsbanner.jpg" width="300" height="225">

<br>
As for doing the cloak quest, I would. Ok, so someone comes out with a White Dragonscale Cloak and that's it, instead of a bard having a chance to buy an epic piece. Imagine this conversation:<br>
<br>
Bard: I heard you were selling a white dragon scale<br>
<br>
Me: Yes, but unfortunately because some people bitched about me getting a scale they wanted me to make a cloak out of it. Sorry about not having much of a chance at your epic.<br>
<br>
Ashreyl, I appreciate that you feel little resentment towards me about the whole affair.<br>
<br>
Dsenier, I have just one question. What does it matter to you how I got the scale? I could have very well made up a whole lie about winning it on someone else's pickup raid, or even refused to tell you my name (was selling it with my mule in EC, druid was camping tainted in LoIO.) It seems that you are resentful that someone got a nice piece of loot and you or a friend didn't have a chance at it. Hate to sound mean, but tough luck. Nobody was FORCED to come. The rules were written out in black and white. I didn't conceal anything. Tell me your motive behind being pissy about this whole thing. This seems to be a case of jealousy more than anything else.<br>
<br>
I don't feel that anyone was &quot;conned&quot; out of anything. If anything, the only person who would profit from me giving up the scale would be Ashreyl, who would have been the only bard to roll on it. I would not let the raid roll on it as bards SHOULD have a chance at their epic. If everyone feels that I should, I will give Ashreyl his fair chance at the scale.<br>

Trade your scale to a bardy for a dragonscale cloak.<br>

Everyone gets what they want, nobody has hard feelings, and bardy takes a MEGA step towards their epic.<br>

A_bard says &quot; anyone got a white scale for my epic?&quot;<br>

lol, your not foolin anyone with this &quot;imagine the poor bard who lost his epic if i do the cloak quest&quot; bullshit. if you were really concerned with helping out a bard you wouldn't be selling the fucking thing for 80k or whatever the hell it is. you'd re-roll it to the bards who were there and DESERVE it.<br>

<br>
Deceive - to make a person velieve what is not true<br>
<br>
So, I did not deceive anyone. The truth was that I would get the scale, end of story. And to my knowledge everyone on the raid knew it (or should have known; I made the point clear only a zillion times).<br>
<br>
It seems everyone forgets something:<br>
<br>
1. It was predetermined that I would get first scale.<br>
<br>
2. Raiders came anyway.<br>
<br>
3. Nobody complained at the time.<br>
<br>
IMO, the raiders didn't give a damn what I did with the scale as long as they got to roll on their loot. If I had tried to claim, say, the patch, I doubt anyone would have cared. It's amusing that it took nearly a month for anyone to say a single bad word about the rules (except for 1 enchanter who immediately apologized because they didn't hear about the rules.) What it boils down to is that the raiders appear to not have cared about the bards losing the chance on the first scale (and the bards didn't care because they had a chance at the RBB. I remember one of the bards saying that when he announced he wanted to come.)<br>
<br>
Dsenier, I think you are just sticking your ass into business that has nothing to do with you in an attempt to make youself look like a hero for bitching about a raid nobody else complained about. And I STILL have yet to hear what your motive behind bringing this up is...<br>
<br>
As for apologizing to the raid members, I do not feel there is anything to apologize for. There was little opportunity for any misunderstanding of the rules. And as to the residents of EMarr being upset, I don't see what is wrong with having people agree to something and then going through with it.<br>
<br>
One last thing I wish to restate: NOBODY WAS FORCED TO DO ANYTHING. If the raiders wanted to leave then they could have and I would have looked like a fool. But the only fool here is Dsenier for believing I &quot;conned&quot; them into it.<br>

<br>
I of all ppl dont blame  you for wanting to do the cloak quest, HOWEVER now you are just rude and greedy, you think you are doing someone a favor by selling a scale for 80k? Didnt someone say that the first one droped went to a lvl 46 bard and there was a lvl 52 on the raid? Regardless if a bard that was on the raid gets the scale you should give it to a bard, any bard that is lvl 52+ and actively workin on their epic. I know atleast 5 bards that fit this description, happy to give you info on them. The reason I think you should give it to a bard instead of doing the quest is that you are a flake, and do not truely want the cloak.<br>

EDIT *** You said in later post in this board that you were trying to help bard by selling, that is BS but the part about where the casual player and getting an epic, Please if a casual player wants an epic let him play a monk .... casual players should not get epic's, least of all bards =), that might be harsh but think of it. (not the bard part) you spend God only knows how much time working on an epic, why spend the limited time you have to doing a single quest?<br>

<br>
I at no point on the raid said I was giving the scale to a friend. I covered costs because it was my duty as raid leader (something I notice many don't do). I also did not tell anyone that I was specifically using the scale for the cloak quest, since at the time I wasn't planning to. As for not doing the cloak quest now, I have no interest in it as I am considering starting another character as my main. I believe many others do this same thing.<br>
<br>
The fast remains that I led the raid with the intent of getting the scale. No, I didn't tell them exactly why, but it didn't seem like they cared.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Xurg, you should probably shut up. I seem to remember a raid of yours where the loot rule for the RBB was that you had to give up an RBG to roll on the RBB, and if you lost you had to roll against everyone else for your OWN RBG. If anything sounds like a con, that's it.<br>
<br>
People lead raids for loot all the time. People go on those raids in hopes of getting their own loot. Now that I have the loot, it really isn't anyones business what I do with it. I could have lied my ass off to Dsenier in EC with my mule, but I didn't because I didn't do anything wrong. <br>
<br>
Dsenier, I STILL want to know what this matters to you, and why you feel the need to ask anyone selling an item how they got it.<br>
<br>
Jexielia, if you personally believed that I was giving the scale to a bard, then I can't help but feel sorry for you deceiving yourself.<br>

If you don't win the loot, you hope it is going to a good place, because after all, you took part in killing a dragon and you want to know you at least made a difference to someone. The scale can be used for the bard quest or an excellent cloak for casters (i have heard). So if a bard wins everyone can be happy that they helped a bard on their epic. If a caster  makes a cloak out of it, that caster is helped out immensely and everyone can be happy that a comrade benefitted in a lesser, but still excellent way. If a raid leader gives the scale to a bard friend (who is VERY appriciate) and hugs and thanks the raid leader for days (or the equivalent) everyone can be happy that such a moment of joy was put into a bard. If someone sells the scale for 80k to some uber level 60 (insert class other than bard here) with loads of cash to spend who thinks things like &quot;i ain't doin no quests for my ghey bard I just want to buy all my epic pieces and be done with it&quot;, it isnt as nice to think about. <br>
Personally if i make 10 more AAxp point before i get the scale and allow myself my last sliver of a blue bub, thats fine. I am doing this quest right:<br>
<br>
Epic: a long series of actions and travels taken by a great hero (or a poem describing such actions)<br>
<br>
Indasha, this isnt about making you give the scale to someone you dont want to; this is about everyone wanting it to go to a good place. I sincerly hope you can see that making a profit on this is nowhere near as good a feeling as helping someone or completing a quest of your own.<br>

<br>
<br>
Everyone of your post's contradict the previous post. You are a joke.<br>
<br>
Indasha do you really think that ppl would do a raid with you if they thought that you were going to try to sell the scale? or use it souly for cash value? You have said like 3 times now ... that you wanted the cloak and you told everyone that this was the reason you wanted the scale. <br>
<br>
See idasha what you are missing is that when you get to loot something like this that can not be done with out others, then you put a price on the item that you got and are not even greatfull enough to use the item as a symbol of pride ... who would want to follow you or even go on a raid with you?  so you duppet alot of ppl into believing that they were helping you, and you could care less as you have posted, I dont really feel sorry for all the ppl that you mislead, I feel sorry for you. To me this is a reflection of YOU not your avatar, so I can only have sorrow for you as your life must be filled with emptyness. <br>

Anyway if it will make everyone stop being pissy I could do the cloak quest. Had another idea but I doubt that any of the jackasses arguing here would listen. So I'll make the cloak and everyone can stop bitchin.<br>
