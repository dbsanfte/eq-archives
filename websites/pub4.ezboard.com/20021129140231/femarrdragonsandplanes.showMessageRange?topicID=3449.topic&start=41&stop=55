Not sure I agree about the pizza though, gotta keep the fat content high in your kids. Also, I can never remember my own eye color, so I certainly don't remember my child's. Come to think of it, I think they are the same as mine, but I'm not sure what mine are. No compact for a mirror here. <br>
<br>
  When my kid gets several years older, she will get to inherit about 90% of her dad's old Legos. I gave the Lincoln Logs and the Capsela sets away, and those damn Slinkys never lasted long, so I'm undecided. She has had a 4 foot teddy bear from birth, which she used to sleep under as a baby. She watches too much t.v., but most of the day she is at daycare so she can socialize. On nice days there's playing catch or taking a walk or something outside. Occasionally there's minor spelling and writing training. There's the struggle to get her into the tub, then out of it.<br>
<br>
  I'm a very boring person now, if you aren't interested in tedious details about my rugrat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufiesti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fiesti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/5/02 4:25:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3449.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mom Who Left Kids in Car Has Criminal Past</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Fiesti you overreacted just the way I was sure someone would. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

When were talking about a real person, I dont think its possible to over react.  If it was about a stolen car, robbed bank, ect then I would maybe see your point.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  From a practical standpoint, would dying to save my child be better or worse for <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
blah blah.  I'm not going to sit around and say it would be &quot;Better&quot; for anyone.  You or a child dying would be a horrible, tragic thing.  If I was your wife and was forced to choose between the two deaths, I would hope you had your things in order.  In my eyes it would be heroic to lose your life to save your childs.  Everyone dies, at least that death would have given a child the chance at life.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  There's just too much emotion out there regarding the issue of children and their safety, and that's what I'm trying to attack here. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm sitting here trying to comprehend this statement, and for the life of me I just cant understand it.  Look around, watch the news, pick up a paper.  Until we live in a perfect world, where children aren't at risk for the numerous dangers in society, there isn't enough emotion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The fundamental question has not been answered: what does it mean to put a child first? How much is enough? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm a very passionate and emotional person.  The question how much is enough, could never be answered from me. Every day when I look in my childrens faces, the answer is nothing is to much.  I'm not talking about the best toys, and most expensive clothes.  I'm simply saying the day will never come where my needs superseed theirs.  <br>
<br>
Their health, food, clothing, personal needs will always come before mine.  If ever a day comes when I cant provide for them, I wouldnt be able to put a limit on what I would do so they were cared for.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Overprotectiveness <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I really dont like that word.  There really isn't a general standard for this word.  I am probably considered as an overprotective parent, but I'm not obsessed with it.  My children know the rules, and understand why they are in place.  <br>
<br>
They dont spend the night at friends houses, but their friends are more then welcome to here.  Double standard?  Maybe so.  I know whats not (guns) in my house, and more importantly what is.  I have no way of knowing if there are guns in their friends houses, or if their friends have been tought proper gun safety.  My children play outside, but only when our property is secured. They get dropped off, and picked up from school.  They dont ride school busses, and they dont have to wait at bus stops, or walk unattended.  <br>
<br>
Accidents do happen, even with overprotected children.  You can't prevent everything, but I do my best  to try and prevent them.<br>

When the discussion is children, or negligent parents you wont get an emotionless post from me. If you dont like it, dont read it.<br>

<br>
You misunderstood me, I really meant this, I'm not saying that, etc.<br>
<br>
All I wanted to add was that it pisses me off to no avail that she tried to play the rape card.<br>
<br>
I'm a woman, and I was raped, defend my rights and go find a random guy and lock him up for hurting me and causing the deaths of my children. <br>
<br>
As a woman she can play that card, but I gaurentee a man would try, and fail, to play a card, excuse, as strong as that. <br>
<br>
She tried to get out of her crime by making stories up, she actually thought she could get away with murder. She would have lived the rest of her days, more than likely, without thinking back upon what happened in that car that day. <br>
<br>
That is sick, she is so self centered and just plain ignorant I'd like to see her, slap her. then just give her one of those looks that say words that can never be spoken.<br>
<br>
 And I don't care what people say the judicial system of America is to a certain degree, about revenge. What good comes out of killing a man? What good comes out of making someone sit in a cell for the rest of their lives? Why not instead keep them in a lightly gaurded hospital/college and re-educate them and give them the mental help they need to become productive members of society when they are pronounced cured?<br>
<br>
The reason Timothy McVey or whatever his name is was killed was because America wanted revenge for his horrendous acts. We call it justice, but what is justice? Payment for one's crime? What is payment? Do you pay for someone elses life with yours? But you must realize, the fact that this &quot;payment&quot; is in fact the organized way of wreaking vengeance.<br>
<br>
The phrases in the bible tell us not to attack those who wrong us, because God will have his revenge upon the wicked. Not saying, let God sort em out. I'm saying. God even calls justice, vengeance. But of course you shouldn't take out revenge that would be deemed, overkill for the crime. You don't put someone in the chair for stealing an apple. That would be deemed unjust, or too wrong, when you want payback, you don't murder a guys family for cutting you off in traffic. <br>
<br>
<br>
It's all in what you want to call it. organized vengeance or justice.<br>
<br>

Michigan has no death penalty.  So sadly for this piece of @#%$ she will waste our tax payers dollars to keep her alive and locked up in a jail cell for the rest of her natural life.<br>

What a pathetic story.  I told my daughter about the suffering she put her kids thru and at 9 she didn't quite understand the complexity of it.  But her comments were pretty much on the ball.  &quot;That woman must be really Dumb!&quot; <p><center>

I am sure the family of the children that died would find great comfort in your humor (or lack thereof).<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes for a moment when I read the story and the first vision I saw was what I could only imagine these babies looked like and experienced. Thier little faces all red and sweaty, probably not crying thinking mommy would be back soon. Then the pain sets in and they start feeling sick, vomiting uncontrollably all over themselves ... and then the crying starts ... and the panic sets in. They slowly drift off, probably still wimpering.<br>
So, did that not affect you with a lump in your throat and wanting to weep for these babies as they suffered ? I would hope not because that would make you just like her.<br>
One thing that really concerns me is the possible lack of attention by passer-bys. Did no one notice these children in the car as it sat in front of a salon ? Is it possible she is the only customer this place had all day? I have reported people in the Wal-Mart parking lot for leaving their sleeping children in car seats in the back.<br>
As for driving around for 3 hours I am sure she was pretty stunned when reality kicked her in the teeth as she came back to see them dead. The horror she felt as she realized someone would know she killed them and what consequences lay ahead for her. You think in 3 hours she could have come up with a better lie.<br>
I am not going to sit here and argue the points of finer parenting. I am a single parent of 4 wonderful children and will NEVER pretend that I am the perfect parent. One thing I can say is that I could never possibly concieve how a mother could do this to her own children, even out of sheer stupidity and selfishness. <br>
Try explaining to the baby she carries that it's mother is the reason it will never know it's siblings.<br>
<br>
As a side note : Who is to say that "smart" people will not create "stupid" children ?<br>

Mom Who Left Kids Faces Manslaughter Charges<br>
<br>
Tarajee Maynor Had Third Child<br>
<br>

<br>
SOUTHFIELD, Mich.-- A woman accused of leaving her two children to die inside a hot car last week is being ordered to stand trial on an involuntary manslaughter charge and not the original charge of murder, Local 4 learned. <br>
 <br>
Tarajee Shaheer Maynor, 25, was originally charged with two counts of felony murder. Judge Steven Cooper of the 46th District Court said that there was not enough evidence to prove that Maynor intentionally killed her children, Local 4 reported. <br>
<br>
Prosecutors want Maynor charged with two counts of first-degree murder. They said that Maynor knowingly left her 3-year-old son and 10-month-old daughter inside a locked car for more than three hours while shopping for clothes, receiving a massage, and getting her hair done at a Southfield salon on June 28. They said that she disregarded the consequences of her actions that day, as temperatures reached into the 80s. <br>
<br>
A detective who interviewed Maynor when she took the children to the hospital said that Maynor made a statement to him and confessed to neglecting her children. She reportedly told him &quot;I would never hurt my children. I was too stupid to know they would die.&quot; <br>
<br>
Defense Attorney Albert Hatchett said that he was pleased with the judge's ruling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Satisfied that the judge took serious note of it,&quot; Hatchett said. &quot;And plus there is a complete absence of any evidence to the contrary.&quot; <br>
<br>
The children reportedly died from hyperthermia after being in the car for about three hours in the sweltering heat. Temperatures in the car reportedly topped 100 degrees and the children likely survived only 20 to 40 minutes, Local 4 reported. <br>
<br>
Maynor drove around three hours with the dead children in her car before taking them to the hospital, Southfield police said. Once at the hospital, she reportedly told investigators that she had been abducted and raped, Local 4 reported. <br>
<br>
Investigators said that the evidence and her story did not match, and began to interview her further. Police said that she eventually confessed to leaving the children inside the car. She reportedly told police that she was trying to figure out what to do as she drove around for three hours after discovering they had died. <br>
<br>
The children were covered with vomit when they were taken to Providence Hospital by their mother, Local 4 reported. Lip marks were found on the car window, suggesting that the 3-year-old was gasping for air, the station reported. The boy also reportedly removed his sister from her car seat in what would appear to be an attempt to help her. <br>
<br>
A judge allowed Maynor to see the children at a private viewing Friday at the James Cole Home For Funerals. <br>
<br>
Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca said that he would continue to seek murder charges. He claims that Maynor intentionally parked her car in the back of the parking lot in an effort to conceal the fact that the children were inside. <br>
<br>
Local 4 has learned that Maynor had a third child. Gorcyca said that she walked into an unnamed Wayne County facility and said that she no longer wanted the child before leaving it there for 58 days. The child was eventually put up for adoption. <br>
<br>
Prosecutors say Maynor is a mother who felt burdened by her children, Local 4 reported. The child she gave up was born some time between her son and daughter who died. <br>

Huh, her lack of maternal feelings ended up saving that child's life. <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/gloriana.html"><img src="http://fyd.fuxored.net/glorymedium.jpg" border="0"></a><p>

For better or worse, I think the cost of capitol punishment is more than the cost of life in prison.<br>
