<br>
can people please stop saying &quot;YOU&quot;RE WORRIED ABOUT KILLING INNOCENT AFGHANS, THERE ARE 5000 INNOCENT AMERICANS DEAD&quot;, there is no logic in this statement.  If Americans are all you care about then, killing innocent afghans will only result in the deaths of more innocent americans through revenge acts of terrorism, just like WTC is claimed to be.<br>
<br>
The people we kill, weather it be through bombs or bullets will either...<br>
1. be innocents whose brothers, sons, and fathers will feel the need for revenge that all Americans feel now, what do you think the're gonna do with those feelings?<br>
2. be guilty, and then they will have fulfilled their lifes goal dieing fighting America, notice the word FIGHTING america, cause they sure as hell aren't gonna die peacefully<br>
<br>
the sad thing, i think, is that many of the war mongers only want us to invade to liven up their dull dreary every day lives, just like WTC did, either that or the're so blaringly stupid and blinded by hatred that they can't see the intense toll an invasion will take on us.  I, unfortunately, don't have that luxury, if we do go to war i'll be in a barracks in the middle of Afghanistan every night for who knows how long wondering if there was a truck packed with explosives just minutes away from me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udydezhomicydez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DydezHomicydez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 9:12:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ye</span><hr size=1> yes i understand the hypocracy in listing fear of terrorism, as a point in opposition to a war on terrorism, my point is that this war is either unwinable or winable at a price that no american is willing to pay. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukytherion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kytherion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/17/01 9:45:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My bad</span><hr size=1> &quot;kyth -- i agree with ya 99% -- except for the reference you make calling him a girl........ &quot;<br>

&quot;This war is unwinnable&quot; <br>
&quot;we aren't willing to pay the price...&quot;<br>
<br>
etc ad naseum.<br>
<br>
There is another thing that appears to be devoid amongst many people of our generation:  Courage.<br>
<br>
Did the Americans curl up into a ball and whine like spoiled children when presented with the daunting task of taking on the Nazi's or Imperial Japan?  Or how about our Revolutinary forefathers taking on the British Empire?<br>
<br>
No one said things will be easy.  And I'm not just talking about things from a military standpoint, but also from a socio-political one. Yes, I'm afraid you may have to give up the SUV if the gas prices get too high, or if gas reserves are required for the war effort.  Or, you will have to learn to have patience and realize the world doesn't revolve around &quot;You&quot;<br>
<br>
Too many people have had things so easy in their lives that they expect everything to be handed to them on a silver platter.  I sound like a friggen old-timer, but you know what, this is the absolute truth.<br>
<br>
Its time to grow up folks, and realize that nothing great is accomplished without hard work or sacrifice.  Its shame that too many are too self-centered to realize this.<br>
<br>
Since thought it appears that many way not want to support their country in time of crisis, you do have the right to go hide in a corner and smoke weed and talk bad about your country.  But when its all said and done, don't even have the balls to come back and ask anything of your country EVER.<br>

It's of the most reprehensible, morally indefensible, sheer EVIL act I've ever witnessed: The destruction of the World Trade Center and the slaughter of those inside it.<br>
<br>
There are an awful lot of shades of gray in this fucked-up world in which we find ourselves, and many times acts of evil don't get recognized as such.<br>
<br>
This time it's so blatant and heinous an act that it seems to me fairly simple . . . it has to be fought against.  Evil MUST be fought against.  Because if you sit back and take it, if you say, &quot;Oh, they killed 5,000 - 10,000 of us but we deserved it in the long run because of things the US has done in the past,&quot; then even worse things will happen to us and the rest of the NATO countries in the future.   Good God, doesn't ANYONE remember World War II?  The Western nations turned a blind eye to what was happening in Germany until it was almost too late.<br>
<br>
The extremists who did this aren't going to go away, and they're not going to be pacified by our turning a blind eye to their crimes.  What's next?  Pony nukes in Denver?  Biological weapons turned on San Francisco?  Where does it stop unless we take a hand in attempting to stop it?<br>
<br>
I turned 18 in 1984.  At that age all I could think of was myself.  If there'd been a draft at the time I would have done anything to get out of it . .  probably would have been 4-F because of my eyes anyway.  And now, even though I still consider myself a pacifist and a liberal, I would do ANYTHING to turn back the clock and have better eyesight so that I could enlist and help fight the inhuman evil behind this monstrously black-hearted and evil deed.<br>
<br>
I hope any of that made sense.  I'm too shaken up to put it in any other terms. <p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mlaye" target="_blank">

We created this country so that everyone could live freely, freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, etc.  Yes you have rights here in America, but you better pay your room and board if you expect to stay here.

Until you have been oversees and seen what other people have to live through: inhumane living conditions, no rights to vote, religious persecution, poverty, etc., then come and talk to me.<br>

<br>
How is being patriotic and thankful to ones country being mindless?  My whole point is not drum up support for all out war, just to inform people that it is their DUTY to their country as citizens to serve if they are called upon.<br>
<br>
&lt;So, what you all are saying is that we need to mindlessly take up the call to arms whenever, and wherever our leaders decide that our &quot;interests are threatned.&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
Are you saying that this is all this incident is about? &quot;interests being threatened&quot;? Time to take off the rose colored glasses there and welcome yourself to the real world.  Things have changed.  Our lives have changed completely - and there are those out there who would commit this represensible acts to kill helpless amercans. Tell me that you think the death of 5000 civilian americans is a trivial thing, then I'll tell you to go play a game of hide and go fuck yourself.<br>
<br>
&lt;I have no problems going to Afganastan as long as there are a few facts that are met:<br>
<br>
1. bin Laden is the coward responsible. We are not quite sure of that yet.&gt;<br>
<br>
What other evidence do we need here? The intelligence agencies and the president himself as well as the intelligence received all points toward him. Sorry, the President is not going to hand deliver his intelligence reports to you all.  Its up to you as &quot;mindful&quot; citizens to examine the evidence presented before you (as civilians, unforunately, we must rely on the press - and we have to weed out the shit to get to the essential information).<br>
<br>
&lt;2. bin Laden is indeed in Afganastan. Out intelligence service says he is, but hey, they have been wrong before.&gt;<br>
<br>
The Taliban himself already admits that he is a guest of their country. Why would they say otherwise when there is a risk of airstrikes on their own cities? I'm sure if he were else where, the Taliban would tell us to point our weapons somewhere else.<br>
<br>
&lt;3. The Taliban governement is indeed hiding him.&gt;<br>

<br>
It is no secret that Osama bin Laden has terrorized the US government prior to the destruction of the WTC and the mass murder of 5,000 people. It is also no secret that the US government is confident that bin Laden is responsible for the WTC murders. Furthermore, the US intelligence community knows that bin Laden is based in Northern Afghanistan; they also know that the Taliban are supportive of his efforts (bin Laden is a high ranking military official in their damn army!) and continue to support him. If a little logic is applied it is not difficult to understand that US troops will soon be in Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
What must be done to convince you and others that this is not simply the matter of a &quot;political agenda&quot;? This is not the Republicans trying to gain votes, or the USA trying to flex colonialist muscle in the third world. For crying out loud, 5,000 people were needlessly slaughtered in New York! We are not talking about conquering communism, this isn't Vietnam! *sighs* I can't expect all US citizens to feel the same horror I felt when I heard news that the WTC was gone with all the people in it, but I can certainly expect every US citizen to stand behind the troops that eventually go to war to protect this country.<br>

<br>
Where is your uniform?  Are you going to fight?  I really hope so, because if the draft is reinstated, I probably will have to.<br>
<br>
I think that you misunderstand the point.  Listen carefully, if I am to go to war, and possibly lose my life, I want to make sure that the cause for which I go is just and honorable.<br>
<br>
As it stands, the cause you seem to espouse is vengence, or even revenge.  I seek justice.  Nothing more, and nothing less.  Yes, a crime has been committed against our country, against our citizens, and against our collective mind, but that does not mean we now have free reign to go and kill more innocent people, regardless of nationality.<br>
<br>
As far as this being a political agenda.  Perhaps it is not at the moment...But who is to say that in six months, when our gorvernment decides that the terrorists in another country are a threat, it could become one.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure I trust our intelligence services fully anymore, as they clearly could not prevent this tradgey from occuring. To prevent this sort of thing is what we pay them for.<br>
<br>
Muzzak brought up the point that even if bin Laden isn't guilty of this one, he is guilty of past ones.  So, we should go get him anyway? Maybe so, but if we do, keep in mind that that opens the door in the future for the president to call up the military to go into any country he feels there are terrorists and &quot;take them down.&quot;<br>
<br>
I want bin Laden brought back to the U.S. to stand trial.  I want him to be the recepient of justice.  Let me remind you that in New York, we do have the death penalty.<br>
<br>
I also really don't appreciate being told to go fuck myself.  Especially by someone who seems willing to let me get killed to cause even more human suffering.  I know that you hurt, so does my mother, and she expressed very similar sentiments when I had this discussion with her.<br>
<br>
The call for blood is loud.  But we need to make sure that the blood that is split is the right blood, lest we become criminals, just like the cowards who have caused all this turmoil.  All I'm asking is for you to shut your mouth and think before you ask me to die for a cause I might not fully support.<br>

Apology accepted.<br>
<br>
I understand that highly emotional topics like these can make us a little blind to common courtesy (I have been guilty of this myself). It's when we stop thinking and become reactionary animals that we lose our humanity and the terrorists win. I'm not saying YOU are, but going over the general tone of the posts under this thread.<br>
<br>
I think what I am most worried about in the upcoming war (and there will be one) is that people will kill with blind hatred. Taking a life, any life, should be done with the full knowledge that you may be killing an innocent. Or an enemy that may not be an enemy someday (look at the British and the Americans). Every loss of life to violence is the loss of hope for the future, no matter who dies. Maybe this makes me a pacifist schmuck...but I guess I'll stand by my schmuckness.<br>
<br>
Would I go to war for my country? yes. Would I mourn every person that died? Yes, on both sides. Going to war and killing your enemies is not something that should be done with anger but in grim determination that this is the only thing you can do now, but with the hope that someday things will be better.<br>
<br>
I forgot what book this passage is from, but it is something to think about (especially if we do not kill bin Laden):<br>
<br>
&quot;There exists a sect of the Hindu religion that believes when a person dies, rather than meeting God in heaven or Satan in hell, that instead they are given a gift. The gift is God's own compassion, and it is through His eyes that they view their own deeds on earth, experiencing all the suffering they have brought to others a millionfold, so that the truly wicked drown in their own sea of tears.&quot;  -Jennifer Horsman<br>

What these people need to realize is, NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE YOUR REASONS HEARD. But once the gverment decides a course of action that the majority of our nation agrees on and if that action requires a draft (something I doubt due to the massive reserves and volunteers we would have), then you shut up about your personal opinion and you go to serve your country. <br>
<br>
If you don't, then you are not American. You can say what you will about personal freedom of decision, but when your country calls you go. Even if you disagree. Otherwise you can run and basically abandon your country and people. But don't complain 20 years from now when those people still consider you a coward and the country you abandoned does not want you back. You make your decision freely, but don't think you can run and then show back up a few years after the war and its 'game on, lets continue as if nothing ever happened'. <br>
<br>
Main point reiterated: Express your discontent now and be heard, but if once we have our course of action then follow it. If you don't, you are a Traitor by our law and deserve treatment in accordance with your crime. And if you don't think that running from a draft makes you a traitor, I suggest you contact a lawyer and verify.<br>
<br>
ps. you could still serve the 5 years for refusing to take up arms and remain an american. I find it sad that anyone would consider giving up their citizenship instead.

If you find it too long to actually read, that's fine, but don't respond to it then.<br>
<br>
Let me start by defining the terms I'm arguing about, since a lot of you are misunderstanding what I'm getting at, and I figure I haven't made myself clear enough yet. I am not arguing about whether or not America should do anything about what happened (although incidentally, I think America certainly should). I'm not trying to argue whether or not this should bring about a war. I never said it is wrong to fight for what you value, when it becomes necessary.<br>
<br>
This entire thing, for me, is a protest to a government that wants to force people to fight for them—the draft—and about the root of that, which is basically altruism. Altruism is the belief that selflessness is a virtue; that men should serve one another. All references to unquestioning obedience (&quot;duty&quot;) owed to others is a form of altruism. I disagree with every premise of that. I stand by the fact that when one man eats, it is only he that is nourished, and no one else, no matter how much he eats. Humans are not a collective whole. We are individuals, no matter how much anyone tries to change this.<br>
<br>
There are people whose aim is to make themselves happy. They do this because it is painfully obvious that making oneself happy is pleasurable.<br>
<br>
There are people who enjoy helping others. They do it for the knowledge and feeling of making someone happy. This amounts to doing it to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> make themselves happy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Let me say that if I was to have someone beside me in a war, I'd sure as hell prefer the man who has the self-respect to think and live for himself (and to protect with a passion all things that influence this) over a man who doesn't think that he is worth enough to fight for (which is indeed the definition of &quot;selfless&quot;), and that the final arbiter of everything is what the majority thinks.<br>
<br>
When people speak of serving the majority, or society, or the public, or the whole, or the collective, or whatever name they wish to give it, do you ever stop to think of the exact meaning of those terms? When someone speaks to someone else of it, they refer to that all-important majority that is defined as being made up of &quot;everyone—except you.&quot; Follow that logic. What that basically leads to is the conclusion that nobody has self-worth. If you are not worth anything, then what could be good in my helping you? What could be good about a majority made up of people who are worthless?<br>
<br>
I don't follow that line of &quot;thought.&quot; I understand that all groups of people are groups of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> individuals</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I hold that the only worth that can be derived from someone is by his will to live for himself.<br>
<br>
Then there are people that will say I should love and care for everyone equally. This is horribly wrong. Anyone who loves everyone equally has no values. What it amounts to is someone saying that the greatest man is equal to the most worthless beggar.<br>
<br>
I'm not going into some debate about whether I am objectively more important than anyone else—that has no place in this specific argument. What I am saying is that I am important to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> myself</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Think of this in broader terms than you have been. That I am important to myself does not mean I have no regard for others; it simply means I am not willing to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> sacrifice</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> myself for others.<br>
<br>
When I say &quot;sacrifice,&quot; I mean it as taking a loss. I do not think of it as a sacrifice to work hard in order to earn one's keep, as I've heard it being referred to. To paraphrase Ayn Rand, it isn't a sacrifice to do without certain luxuries in order to feed your baby, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> if</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you care more about sustaining and nourishing your baby than you do for having said luxuries. It <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a sacrifice, though, to let your baby die in order to feed the neighbor's baby instead, if you personally cared more for your baby than for your neighbor's.<br>
<br>
Do you see more clearly what I am getting at? So long as you are comprehending what it is I am arguing, I really don't care if you disagree with me. What this means is that you have no grounds to call me a coward. The term that most of you will be looking for (if you haven't found it already) is &quot;selfish,&quot; although I take pride in the title while you will mean to condemn me with it. With that said, let me get to responding to all these posts...<br>

When you guys grow up a bit you will understand. I have a three year old son. He's the love of my life, all I really have basically. I could never look him in the eyes and say &quot;I'm not enough of a man to defend you son&quot;. You apparently don't have anyone that you are willing to die for do you Triff and Glade? If that's the case I'm sorry you both live such isolationist lives. When your own children, parents, loved ones, and threatened..you will act..you have to if you are human. I consider all American people to be my brothers and sisters. Black, White, Islamic, Jewish. I will not stand before them and tell them that I wish to live and enjoy the fruits of this country but I am too scared for my own life to fight for what we believe in. This type of post frankly sickens me guys..please rethink where you stand and lose your selfishness..if you die in war so be it..if I die in war so be it..at least I know my son can grow to manhood safely becuase I had the balls to defend my country.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I will fight to protect what I care about. That's not the problem. What I am saying is that that I care about my personal interests far more than I do about all the others. You are apparently making no distinction between your son and everyone else in the country. I'm not afraid to fight for my ideals, but I'm not willing to be forced to fight for anyone else.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Kytherion:<br>
So which is it, Gladetree? I mean, is this a post-teenage angsty civil liberties issue, or are you just unable to see eye to eye with the Pres on this little debate?<br>
<br>
Shit, why didn't you say so? We'll make sure the Supreme Allied Commander consults with you before he does anything! We wouldn't want to deploy forces without your fine strategic insight. Make sure you leave us your new number in Canada.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->So what you're saying is that the American thing to do is obey, obey, obey and don't question? Is that your idea of a hero?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Did the Americans curl up into a ball and whine like spoiled children when presented with the daunting task of taking on the Nazi's or Imperial Japan? Or how about our Revolutinary forefathers taking on the British Empire?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->So far I haven't seen anyone at all say they should've.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lanarie:<br>
No one said things will be easy. And I'm not just talking about things from a military standpoint, but also from a socio-political one. Yes, I'm afraid you may have to give up the SUV if the gas prices get too high, or if gas reserves are required for the war effort. Or, you will have to learn to have patience and realize the world doesn't revolve around &quot;You&quot;<br>
<br>
Too many people have had things so easy in their lives that they expect everything to be handed to them on a silver platter. I sound like a friggen old-timer, but you know what, this is the absolute truth.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm not asking people to give things to me. What I am doing is refusing to fight for anyone except myself.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lanarie:<br>
Its time to grow up folks, and realize that nothing great is accomplished without hard work or sacrifice. Its shame that too many are too self-centered to realize this.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->See what I said about sacrifice. Hard work is put forth to achieve goals. Sacrifices are put forth to destroy individuals. There's a difference, and I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> am</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> working hard, myself.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Bordon:<br>
America gave you the right to live here freely. HOWEVER, if your country calls upon you to defend it's borders, then damnit you better answer the call. Don't expect others to carry your load.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->America didn't give me my rights. Every reasoning being is born with them, and a man's rights should never be taken away from him unless he violates the rights of someone else. What the American military did was defend its citizens' rights from being revoked by others. And I'm not asking anyone else to go fight for me. It's their own decision to fight.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Bordon:<br>
I will not tolerate &quot;non-team&quot; players.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Contextual translation: &quot;I will not tolerate anyone who doesn't do what the government tells him to do.&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lukaria Trueheart:<br>
Triff, in the end, what you have been saying is that your life is more important than anyone else's.<br>
<br>
You would let my son die before you lifted a hand to help because you don't know him.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I never said my life is more important than anyone else's. I said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> value my life and my interests above everyone else's. And in all actuality, if I, personally, saw your son coming to some peril, and helping him wasn't obvious suicide, I'd probably help him because it would make me happy to do so. But thank you for understanding that I should not required to help you or him if I don't want to.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lanarie:<br>
My whole point is not drum up support for all out war, just to inform people that it is their DUTY to their country as citizens to serve if they are called upon.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->And my whole point is to tell you that I owe you nothing.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Muzaak:<br>
I can't expect all US citizens to feel the same horror I felt when I heard news that the WTC was gone with all the people in it, but I can certainly expect every US citizen to stand behind the troops that eventually go to war to protect this country.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I will stand behind those troops if their target is chosen logically. I won't stand behind the government's decision if Bush sends them somewhere stupid. I think for myself.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lanarie:<br>
Its all about you isn't it? No one else is important. Because lord knows you have been catered to and pacified your entire life. Sure its ok for the guy next to you to get his ass blown off, but not you...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I don't wish a draft on anyone. It's not just wrong for me; it's wrong for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anyone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be forced to fight for someone else.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Smashgnome:<br>
You enjoy the freedom of this great Republic/Democracy, now it is time to pay back your country.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->For what little I have of it, personally, I pay the tax money that funds the intelligence agencies and military to do the jobs they signed up to do. I do not recognize anyone's right to force <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> me</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to go take those jobs too.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Celdor:<br>
But once the gverment decides a course of action that the majority of our nation agrees on and if that action requires a draft (something I doubt due to the massive reserves and volunteers we would have), then you shut up about your personal opinion and you go to serve your country.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Obey!<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Celdor:<br>
Express your discontent now and be heard, but if once we have our course of action then follow it. If you don't, you are a Traitor by our law and deserve treatment in accordance with your crime.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You know, the people who founded America in the first place were traitors to Britain. You can bet that they didn't wait to let their government decide for them. They thought for themselves and fought Britain's oppression. America was founded by and for men who think, not for men who follow orders without question.<br>
<br>
Cry all you will that I owe you my time and life. I don't accept anyone else's claim to that. I live for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> myself</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> values, and if anyone else tries to force me to live, fight, and die for them, I will fight <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> them</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.
