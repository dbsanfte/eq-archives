I attended a Vox raid with my rl husbands character to help a guildie (Knotz) in hopefully getting the vox book.  My problem is not with this raid in general but in the events that transpired after.<br>
<br>
Vox dropped the pally book at the raid I attended.  There were only 2 pallies attending, but a mistake happened and Syldra looted the book.  It was probably an honest mistake, and I wasnt upset at all about it.  She proceeds to roll the book and says she will chain for the winner.  The other pally won, grats Fenoiel.  The book at this point is supposed to be chained to him when he is rdy.  <br>

<br>
The post has been edited now, but Jex basically says first book to Fen, and the book she has will be chained to the ONLY other pally on the raid Knotz.<br>
<br>
Later in the thread she added a few more posts, and a part about chaining the pally book to whoever is on the next raid and rdy for that step.<br>
<br>
Knotz spoke in game with her, and she said if Fen was on the raid he would get the book that dropped and the one she had would be chained to Knotz.<br>
<br>
Raid time comes, and she changes the loot rules once again.  Instead of the book for PALLY epic being randomed to paladins, its now going to be randomed to paladins and druids.<br>
<br>
Yes I know this is her raid, she's taking the time and leading it, then its her rules.  My problem is you post one thing, change it a few times, have people come out who agree with your loot rules, then just before the raid you change them again.  What the Fook is up with that?  <br>
<br>
Why does a druid need to roll on a paladin epic piece.  Why isnt your word as good as your raid.  You had my respect  at one point.  After watching you change your loot rules over and over, and your loot rules on your upcoming raids you have lost any respect I once had for you.  <br>
<br>
You can lead a raid, no question there.  Now you  just need to  remove your head from your ass, and realize everyone in this game isnt here to bow down before you.  You want respect from people, have some courtesy and stand by your fooking word.  You've let your ability to lead a raid go straight to your head.  You have become selfish and greedy.If a piece of dragon loot means more to you then your self respect, you've become more desperate than can be imagined.<br>

Doesn't sound like she's all that greedy to me.

<br>
I know that book sucks. It's annoying at best when raid leaders change their rules regarding loot over and over again but your best bet in situations like this is just walk away. If a raid leader wants to change loot rules every 2 minutes you can choose to change whether you participate every 2 minutes also. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
<font color=yellow>Vox dropped the pally book at the raid I attended. There were only 2 pallies attending, but a mistake happened and Syldra looted the book. It was probably an honest mistake, and I wasnt upset at all about it. She proceeds to roll the book and says she will chain for the winner. The other pally won, grats Fenoiel.

<br>
Facts: <br>
<br>
2 paladins were on this raid, Knotz and Fenoiel. I looted the book by mistake, randomed it and let him know (Fenoiel) that I had petitioned to see if a GM would assist in transferring the book to his account, and that if the GM would not assist I would chain it to him when he was ready.<br>
<br>
It was brought to my attention that Fenoiel was not ready for chaining of the book (understandable) and I wanted to do something to make sure that he wouldnt lose out in the long run.  (honestly I dont know how long Im going to be around in game, RL has been kicking my ass lately and I dont even have my own internet access at the moment, so I didnt want to poof and have this guy's book rot along with all my characters) SO... I posted a raid for the following week...<br>
<br>
http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1419.topic<br>
<br>
The above post is from the raid that was led just last night.  The only edit made to the post is the top part stating the raid was complete... (just the part before the loot rules)... as far as the loot and on nothing was edited... ever.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Then comes a Vox pick up raid post by Jex. In which she states this loot rule in particular. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
The post has been edited now, but Jex basically says first book to Fen, and the book she has will be chained to the ONLY other pally on the raid Knotz.</font><br>
<br>
Yay, ok!  What's so bad about this?  Nothing imho... I was trying to 1. get Fen the book and 2. come up with a FAIR way to deal with the book that I have on my character.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Later in the thread she added a few more posts, and a part about chaining the pally book to whoever is on the next raid and rdy for that step.</font><br>
<br>
No, there was no changes to the loot rules in that thread, thanks.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Knotz spoke in game with her, and she said if Fen was on the raid he would get the book that dropped and the one she had would be chained to Knotz.<br>
<br>
Raid time comes, and she changes the loot rules once again. Instead of the book for PALLY epic being randomed to paladins, its now going to be randomed to paladins and druids.</font><br>
<br>
Ok let me ask one thing... What the fvck are you talking about?<br>
<br>
Knotz spoke to me in game and it all started out fine, Fen wasnt online and I hadnt seen him since the night of the first raid.  He started carrying on about the book and I told him that if Fen didnt come that the book (if dropped) would be randomed to all paladins on the raid.  <br>
<br>
At this time he was the ONLY paladin in chat, and interested in coming on the raid... but he continued to carry on and throw a fit.  He bitched about the fact that Fen wasnt ready for the book and that I should roll the book and give it to him.  I told him that regardless of his (Fen's) epic status it was HIS BOOK because HE won the random... <br>
<br>
Knotz carried on and pestered and bitched for quite a while, making an ass of himself in raid chat and in tells... he made such comments as "you wouldnt know ethics if they slapped you in the face" etc... eventually I stopped arguing and went on about getting the raid going.<br>
<br>
Never ONCE did I say anything about anyone BUT paladin's would be rolling on the book... I only stated that if Fen did not show for the raid that the book (if dropped) would be randomed to ALL PALADINS PRESENT.<br>
<br>
(3 Druids were present on this raid btw Oakleaves, Dharani, and Harney... check with each individually... no mentioning or inquiring of the paladin book was made by any of these druids and Im sure anyone else in that raid will back me up on this.)<br>
<br>
Shortly after Knotz's hissy fit... Fen shows up, I pick him up and drop him off in SFG...<br>
<br>
Then I have Knotz send me a tell as follows...<br>
<br>
"HAHAHA so the truth comes out, you already chained the book"<br>
<br>
I tell him he doesnt know what the hell he's talking about and to @#%$ off... he tells me Im on ignore... NO SWEAT OFF MY BACK he was the one harassing me!<br>
<br>
we do the raid... 2 paladins are there (Fen and one other who already has his book)  Book goes to Fen as promised... had Knotz not been a complete moron and @#%$ he would have had the book I looted (as posted) but after his attitude I would rather destroy it than chain it to him.<br>
<br>
If he had shut his mouth and not been a greedy bitch about it he would have had a Vox book handed to him... but he decided to be anal and make false accusations and insult me and my morals.  (Im not perfect but Im sure in hell not out to screw anyone over)<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>You can lead a raid, no question there. Now you just need to remove your head from your ass, and realize everyone in this game isnt here to bow down before you.

So now I'm confused. Is this just an honest mistake on both parts?</font><br>
<br>
A week ago two paladins attended a raid led by some 42 warrior, the warrior got everyone wiped in buffhall and bailed... causing for a bunch of confusion and bullshit... I ended up leading and looted the book by mistake...<br>
<br>
On last nights raid only 2 paladins came (the thread that you're referring to), Fen and another pally who was just there to support his guildmates.  He did not need the book because he has it.  Knotz did not come because he made assumptions and decided to take off before the raid even started.  <br>
<br>
The rules were never changed... if Knotz would have waited it out and not jumped all over me he would have had his book and none of us would be here now.<br>
<br>
Rather than making me out to be the "bad guy" I think I did the "good guy" thing by blowing a saturday night to stay at home to lead a dragon raid to make up for a mistake that I made. <p><font color=yellow>

<br>
He lost the roll on the only raid he went on that was led by me... tough luck to loose Im sure, cant win all the time.  Doesnt mean that he's more entitled to it than anyone else because he lost a random on that specific raid, imho. Im sure I can fish out a paladin or two somewhere who have been on more than 1 raid with me and never got a book...<br>
<br>
He chose to be a dick rather than hang out and get a free shot at the book last night and now his guildmates/friends are attacking me because he made an assumption and jumped to conclusions without trying to work it out rationally.  <br>
<br>
Im not a hard person to get along with, most people who dont like me have no ground other than what they've been told or what they assume about my character, and I have a lot of people say "heh, everyone says you're such a bitch but you're not so bad"... kinda like these people on my ass about Knotz book being stolen away from him when there's no one to blame but him *shrug*<br>
<br>
The book is up for grabs but with his attitude and approach yesterday and the events since then there is no way in hell I'll chain it to him...<br>
<br>
That would be like someone slashing my tires, keying my car and me giving them a ride to the store... <p><font color=yellow>

As posted in that thread below you, I said you could find my reply here.  Granted I was extremely livid with you at the time of the recent raid, but I (nor any other guildies) had planned on coming here.  Were more the type people to just add you to our &quot; wouldnt piss on you if your on fire &quot; list, than hit the flames board.  You prevoked a reply, you got a reply.<br>
<br>
I dont contest any of the events of the first raid.  You have your facts straight.  We chalked it up and moved on.  We didnt whine, nor complain that he hadnt started his epic.  We congratulated him, and moved on.  <br>
<br>
Then there's a post about a future dragon raid.  Great news for Knotz because if Fen shows, he gets the book that drops and the one you had would get chained to HER ( its a she btw rl even!) as long as she attended the raid.  She signed up for the raid, and cleared her schedule so she could attend.<br>
<br>
Here's another quote from the thread of the vox raid you recently lead...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Not a problem V, already said I'd chain it... problem is cant guarantee I'll be around forever, which is why I've resorted to hopefully defaulting a book so that I can random the one I have to someone who is ready for it so that it isnt wasted.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Maybe I read into this post, this is what I meant about changing rules in future posts btw.  At first the book would go to Knotz if Fen was able to loot a book  on this raid, now correct me if I'm wrong here you say you want to &quot;random&quot; the one you have  to  someone (no mention of her name) who is ready for it.<br>
<br>
I  know I wasnt the only one that was concerned with the above post, its the reason Knotz even spoke with you prior to the raid yesterday.<br>
<br>
Granted I dont know what transpired in tells between the two of you (I'm sure if there's a log I can get it sent to me).  I do know Knotz was very upset and felt she was wronged.  She's not the type of person to sit back, shut up and take it.  Tell me if someone ran  up  to you, pulled your pants down and started @#%$ you in the Ass would  you  just sit there and shut up?  Ok so maybe that's not the best analogy, but you get the hint.<br>
<br>
Knotz is a very honorable person, and I respect her dearly.  I'm not saying she was perfect in the tells she  sent to you, but she had questions about the loot rules and wanted to get it straight  BEFORE the raid.  I'm not sure where the whole druid thing comes into play, I believe in tells possibly.  When she left the raid,  she was under the impression the paladin books would be   randomed to paladins and druids.  During all this she also gets a tell saying that you had chained the book you looted already, again adding to her frustration level.<br>
<br>
The comments at the end of my original post, were from a very  frustrated officer.  While it may not have been right with the few negative comments I added, I was pissed and drunk.  Not a very good combination for me, sooo for that I apologize.  I do  believe this statement  isnt acurate though...<br>

Knowing Knotz for quite awhile now, she has been anything but greedy.  I'm not exactly sure why you  would call her that   anyway after the loot rules of your recent posts.  ( If 2 CoF's  drop, seconds one's mine thing)  Just because she felt she deserved one of her last  2 pieces, and was counting on your word, doesnt make her greedy at all.<br>

<br>
I never said it was anyone but Knotz... but how could I have been certain that either person would show despite my efforts to have last nights raid done in hopes to get Fen a book and default the one I looted to Knotz?<br>
<br>
I couldnt have been sure... but Vaalk was looking out for his guildee... and I was reassuring him, imho, that his guildmate would not be @#%$ over... simple concept eh?<br>
<br>
Assuming my intention were anything other than what they were was just stupid, you could have asked.<br>
<br>
Knotz asked, she was given an answer, and AT THE TIME Fen was not online, and I was not expecting him to show because I hadnt seen him online... I told Knotz that the book (if dropped and Fen was not there) would be randomed to all paladins... she then DEMANDED that the book I looted was MY PROPERTY and that I should give it to someone other than Fen because Fen was not ready for it... when I argued that it was NOT MY BOOK she got angry and said that it was my book because I looted it... well THAT my friend would have been wrong.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Granted I dont know what transpired in tells between the two of you </font><br>

You dont know @#%$ about what happened, so deal with it.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>When she left the raid, she was under the impression the paladin books would be randomed to paladins and druids. </font><br>
<br>
She got the wrong impression, and rather than making accusations at me and getting hot headed she could have simply tried to clarify it with me without getting all anal about it and accusing me of already chaining the book and being a theif =P<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I'm not exactly sure why you would call her that anyway after the loot rules of your recent posts. ( If 2 CoF's drop, seconds one's mine thing) </font><br>
<br>
Hey Im leading the raids and asking nothing in return for doing it other than the ability to hang with old friends, meet new ones and have a good time.  If I was out to get loot and better myself and be greedy dont you think I'd keep the FIRST CoF to drop?  Prolly... the odds of two dropping are slim to none... the odds of ONE dropping is low... this does NOT make me greedy... thanks =P<br>
<br>
Your friend may be honorable and you may think that they're a great wonderful person... but other than what you have been told (he said she said) you have honestly NO SOLID PROOF that Im not honorable either.<br>
<br>
As far as my reply to that post... your friend as honorable and respectable as he/she is was a complete ass and acted in a way that was totally uncalled for considering the fact I DID NOT HAVE TO post that I would default the book I looted to her if a book dropped for Fen...<br>
<br>
Next time I try to go out of my way to help someone out I'll make sure that person is capabale of comprehending the fact that not everyone is out to get them. <p><font color=yellow>

I was amazed to read that the Pally epic book would be randomed to pallies, and Druids on the raid. <br>
<br>
I said &quot;What the %$#@ is up with that.. I have never heard of any druid needing this book, But I read it twice to make sure i was reading correctly what you typed to Knotz.<br>
<br>
I then went and looked up the druid epic to make sure as I don't really know much about leaf blowers.. I was not supprised to find that ..nope .. druids don't need the book. I would not have taken the time to sign off.. and dig up favorite websites had I not read this myself!<br>
<br>
Why you typed this to her I have no clue..nor do I really care.. Maybe you were trying to carry on two conversations at once .. My point is ..you did type this. <br>
<br>
<br>
Knotz always felt that Fel should have the book from the first raid. there was never a question of that. I have read several conversations she has even had with him.. just to make sure he recivieved the chaining.. I think you will find that he has gained respect for her as well.<br>
<br>
Greed is and never was the problem here when it comes to Knotz. She was ready to move on to the next raid. and to take her chances in future raids.. But it was the understanding by many people ..not just Knotz..that &quot;if&quot; Fel recieved the actual book on the raid you lead last night, then you would chain the one you have to Knotz (being as she was the only other pally on the first raid as you originally posted on the board)<br>
<br>
If was the key word here.  <br>
 the fact that Fel wasn't online yet made it so that the book would be randomed, and she was just asking for verifcation of this..  <br>
<br>
She tried to verify the loot rules before the raid and that was when you took it to tells and typed that Druids were going to also be in on the roll.<br>
<br>
Knotz Never asked, or told you that the book from last nights raid should not be randomed to all pallies on the raid of last night.  <br>
<br>
The only thing she asked was &quot;Why Druids when it is a pally epic item?&quot; shouldn't it be randomed to only the pallies on the raid?&quot;  to which you would not respond.<br>
<br>
From that point I agree things got nasty.. from both sides.. <br>
<br>
personally .. I understood Knotz was annoyed.<br>
<br>
Knotz also corrected you several times that She is a She not a he..where you said &quot;I call everyone Sir&quot; and you Still persist on calling her a &quot;he&quot; are you doing this just to be rude or provoke ? if so..how much more childish can you be? I am amazed that you persist even here on the boards.<br>
<br>
I just started laughing and said well there are two genders on our world and I wonder what world you are actually from.. <br>
<br>
My understanding is that If Fel recieved the book from last night.. then the one that you looted (by mistake) would be chained by default to Knotz since SHE was the only other pally on the first raid.<br>
<br>
I also read the tell from someone saying that you had already chained the book to someone else.  Could this be the real issue?   <br>

I can see where Knotz really wants her epic, we all do.  But the fact is, Fen won the rights to the book that dropped on that raid, so Knotz really has no claim to the book at all.  If for any reason she decided to chain it to anyone, I'd think that person would be happy as hell that they were getting a shot at it.<br>
<br>
I dont understand the druid thing unless it was some kind of typo.  However, the sad part is, even if that was what Jex wanted, the raid leader makes the rules and if you dont like them you can always attend the next raid.<br>
<br>
About the thought of her already chaining it:  Why is this an issue?  Someone saw Jex and Fen together and talked out of their ass without any facts saying that Jex had already chained it to them.  GUESS WHAT... Fen WON the book.  Even if that happened (which according to the stories it didn't).. that's the person who won the book in the first place.  Why would Knotz have a higher claim than the person who actually won the book in the roll?  I feel for Knotz, my epic is no walk in the park to get either, but the facts are she has no claim to this book.  And if someone verbally abused me, whether they had been misled by others or not, there's not much of a chance of me helping them. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

NO thats not how it is, I dont care whos leading we as the community shouldnt be content with others who allow greed to overwhlem them.<br>
<br>
The facts, Knotz was well aware of who won the book and was happy for them.  Disappointed for herself I am sure but she held no contempt for the other person.  <br>
<br>
Fact, Jax said she/he was going to chain the book for Knotz because she was leaving the game and Knotz was the only other paladin at that raid...thats fair.<br>
<br>
Fact, Jax changed her mind (omg shes the fackin raid leader shes allowed to be greedy and get away with it) and said Druids could roll on a paladin epic book so they can SELL the chain rights, boolsheet!  Epics are a pain in the ass and I am sure I did some things trying to get my epic that were flame worthy, blame VI.  But from person to person an agreement had been made and when it boils down our word is our bond.<br>
<br>
As for Knotz getting snappy at Jax it may have happened but I am sure that it didnt happen until Jax pulled the rug from under Knotz.  I mean come on, please, why would someone be shitty to someone else who was going to hook them up with an epic piece?<br>
<br>
Why am I getting involved?  Because I know Knotz and she is a sweetheart.  She is quiet, reserved and respectful.  Never once have I heard a foul resentful thing come from her mouth, only tells me that if someone got a piece of mind gum from her they deserve to chew it...She knows this thread is here and even now refuses to come in and talk bad about someone.

<br>
not sure you understand that we are talking about a combonation of two raids, two pallie books etc..<br>
<br>
 the first one.. raid leader (Jex) looted &quot;by mistake&quot;<br>
<br>
randomed off the chaining and Fel won (Gratz Fel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Fel was not quite ready to do the chaining as he has other parts of his epic to do before that point.<br>
<br>
Jex posted that next raid she would be leading Fel would have the book by default (post has been edited)when/if Fel recieved the second book then Jex would chain the first book to knotz  (something that Knotz never asked for..but was delighted as she is very close to finishing her epic)<br>
<br>
It was understood that the first book was Fel's unless Fel would like to go on second raid and have the actual book from the second raid so that he could finish his epic at a future time.  If Fel decided not to go on the second raid.. and the second book from the second Raid would be randomed off (the question was to all pallys and/or druids) if Fel was not there.  Knotz would have been in on the roll if she chose to attend the raid..but that she had no better chance at the book than any other pally on the second raid. Up to this point things were fine and understood by Knotz and she was in complete agreement.<br>
<br>
<br>
She had decided to attend but simply wanted to verify the rules .. and that is when the Druid roll on the pally book became an issue.  At that point when she could not understand why Druids would be rolling on the book..It was at this last minute change in the rules that Knotz chose at the last minute not to attend the raid under Jex. <br>
<br>
and Knotz was also told that Jex had already chained the book. (this was not verifyable either way and still is not)<br>
<br>
Mean while.. Knotz was also in contact with Fel and it was clear he had not chained the book with Jex yet. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
sooooo, basically, Jex has a chainable pally book that ....that is more than likely to be put it up for sale somewhere ..yet she is the one that is calling knotz &quot;greedy&quot; etc.. Jex also decided to post to a raid (on Dragon and planes raids)  that EH is holding so that we may get the book for Knotz  EH members (including knotz) Never took it public until Jex decided to post on EH's raid anouncement.<br>
<br>
 it is not about the book anymore.. We are moving on taking care of things ourselves Knotz's guild is backing her up so that she doesn't have to depend on someone that gives their word, then changes it. <br>
<br>
If it were about the book..this thread would be over.. Knotz figures she will never see the book from the first raid and she is Happy that Fel recieved his book..Many others feel the same way about it all.<br>
<br>
Why Jex decided to post to someone elses dragon raid is beyond me. It was not her place to do so.  Nothing was said to her or about her..yet she decided to bring it to a main board.. EH moved it to Rants and flames where it belongs<br>
<br>
Technically, the first book still belongs to Fel, the second book belongs to Fel. Knotz is happy for him.. They respect each other..  the problem was that Jex looted the first book in the first place instead of randoming it.. now she gets to keep it ..  sell it..give it to anyone she chooses. <br>
<br>
It sux but Yes unfortunately, that is just the way things are..<br>

I dont know Knotz and I'm not saying anything bad about her.  From what I've heard, she's generally a very nice person and I think it was my guildie who won against her (that people seemed like they would have a problem if it was chained to them) that volunteered to help get Knotz her Naggy book even though Fen doesn't have it yet.<br>
<br>
We all know epics are frustrating, but I'm trying to tell you this thread isn't going to help anyone.  You're going to lose most people when they read that it was started because Knotz didn't get an epic piece she lost the roll on.  You'd probably be better served honoring Knotz's wishes on it and moving on. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

Knotz is happy for him.<br>
<br>
Biggest problem was that Jex decided to post a Rag about Knotz to Dragon raid annoucement rather than letting it go.<br>
<br>
At least it is here now.. where it should be..this is after all what rant and flames boards are about ... <p>Grand Mistress skill in Jewelery Crafting(250)<BR>
