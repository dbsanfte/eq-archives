Anyways, Arikel RoD did apologize and offer to make amends to the Medicuus action.  Even if the member themselves wouldn't just stand up and say, &quot;oops, I'm a dick&quot; the guild did come forth and make good.  Not sure if their offer was taken up or not but it was more the principle of the matter so I figure the offer was good enough in my eyes.<br>
<br>
anyways, Arikus is WRONG!!!!!!<br>

<br>
Seriously, I wasn't referring only to the RoD incedent, but I did have it in mind.  I wasn't aware that they'd offered to make amends, and I'm glad to hear that they did.  However, there are still other examples supporting my statement.  Guilds these days just don't police themselves like they used to, or at least like some of them used to.  It's a sad thing, but I suppose given the loss of players to boredom and DAoC, and the sheer numbers needed for the high end Velious encounters I suppose it may be a necessity. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

I will therefore try again.<br>
<br>
I do not think highly of Sejal as a player.  No where in my post do I say the words Crimson Eternity.  I like CE.  I am friends with numerous people over there, and have never had any serious issues with them.<br>
<br>
Someone (not Sejal) decided it was necessary to come flame me, question if I really was a member of MF, and call me a liar over on my own guild board public section.  C'est La Vie.  The thread has been deleted.  I spoke with a CE officer regarding the incident.  The person has failed to contact me, and logged off before I could contact them in game last night. (I noticed they were on shortly before Dain pull, not a good time to have a /tell chat) The entire purpose of my post was to voice my opinion of both Sejal and his gating on the group, and to recount a similar incident in the past of which I was a direct witness of poor behavior and overreaction by Sejal. <br>
<br>
I stand completely by what I wrote.  I do not see how any of what I stated could be misconstrued as a lie, or even assigned a truth/falsehood value.  It was entirely opinion.  I still think there is no excuse for getting a res, waiting until the ICG's repop and *then* deciding to quit on the group.  Why not gate after the res instead of in the middle of a non-trivial fight?  Gating out on that party fighting ICG's got them killed, if this story is to be believed.  And since people posted they had spoken to Sejal about it, and he admitted he shouldn't have gated, assuming they are not lying as well, then that's what happened.  If this whole story is a fabrication, go accuse the person that started it of being a liar.  Even if it was fabricated, this story would not make my own incident and subsequent opinion a lie, since my opinion was formed over that incident and only reinforced by this one.<br>
<br>
The only comment that even comes close to having a truth value is the where I ask why experience matters so much to Sejal since he has not leveled since I knew him 6 months ago.  I do believe Sejal was 55 (as was reported at the start of this thread) when he was a candidate with Institute.  Perhaps I was mistaken about his level.  I also went and double checked my screen shots of that incident, and they happened early June, so make it 5 months instead of 6. <br>
<br>
Mistake on an insignificant point does not equal a lie, nor make me a &quot;lying POS.&quot; I am sure he had to be at least 53 since that is what I believe the level requirements were at that time.  So even if he has leveled from 53 to 55 in 5 months, I believe my statement is still valid.  If someone takes 5 months to gain two levels, a single (90 percent ressed) death should be of practically no consequence to them.  <br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with being a slow leveler per se either.  My comment applies ONLY to someone who is a very slow leveler getting mad enough about a single death to intentionally kill their party because they died. Someone leveling that slow demonstrates by their own behavior that experience and leveling is not a top priority with them.  So therefore dying and only losing 10 percent of that experience should not matter very much either.  It is certainly no justification for gating on a crypt group.<br>
<br>
So in summary, Sejal is a whiny brat.  Lo and behold others have similar stories about him, tending to lend credence to my opinion about him.  If someone wants to call me a liar and a POS and question whether I am even in Midnight Fury, have the balls to contact me in game, post it here, or just drop it.  Don't come into my &quot;house&quot; and flame me.<br>
