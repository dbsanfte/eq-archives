<br>
       Attacking Ayron's use of English is purely infantile at best, especially considering his native language isn't even English. And no, Mel and Ayron are not alternates of each other, unless some things have changed since I disbanded myself from DG oh, a lil less than a month ago.<br>
I'd subsequently quit EQ at that time as well, with the dim hopes of returning sometime in the future. <br>
<br>
       Though it is not my place, nor my perrogative to apologize for their actions, I do so now. All I can offer is a simple sorry, for my old comrades. Something did indeed change since I was one of their ranks and thank whichever God or gods are listening I was not caught up in this whirlwind of insanity.<br>

It seems most are still waiting for some sort of &quot;official&quot; DG statement.  Anything at all would suffice, but to continue this silent treatment does nothing but show the way DG truly feels about the rest of the server.  They obviously believe themselves to be above us,  So fuck them, they deserved to be roasted.  All 187 of them.<br>

This is a personal apology as well as one for my guild. <br>
I was present at the raid and as an officer I should have spoke up against it had I known for certain it was PC's turn. I unfortunately did not. That though is no excuse.<br>
<br>
I do believe that everything could have been handled better and perhaps all this could have been avoided, but as it has been pointed out, its done and we have to live with it.  <br>
<br>
What we have done, was wrong. Better communication on our part unfortunately wasn't followed up on. <br>
Backing off and letting VS go would have been the right thing to do. It wasn't done.<br>
It was a mistake again on my part as an officer present not to have spoken up. <br>
<br>
Again I do humbly appologise.<br>
<br>
Seriously, for the most part, the members of DG are good people and most do not deserve any resentment that an officer such as I should. I was my job to have foreseen and forestalled such incidents and to have uphold what was right. <br>
I failed in that respect.<br>
<br>
I really do sincerely appologise<br>
<br>
I will speak up for my guild that the reason why most of us do not post here is simply that we unfortuantely are usually the &quot;butt&quot; of your jokes. Most of them are not deserved. I for one have tried my best to be a good player both as a player and as a person. However, I am only human and this wasn't one that I will be proud of. Unfortunately, it is all to easy for a single wrong doing to smear what good I have done in the past and nothing can change the fact. A single bad deed will be long remembered more so then what ever &quot;good&quot; I have done. <br>
<br>
Please do accept my appologies. <br>
If you still feel that you have to send &quot;hate tells&quot; and abuse to my fellow guildmates, please, send them to me instead. <br>
My fellow guildmates do not deserve your hate nor resentment.<br>
<br>
Emarr is a server I am and still is, poud to be a member of. If you choose to feel that I deserve only your compempt, that is my fate. <br>
<br>
ps: I do hope that anyone who reads this will take it for what it is, a sincere appology. If I could, I'd come to you in person and offer it. If you choose not to accept, there is nothing I can do. <br>

<br>
In all seriousness I'm not kissing anyone's ass. I just happen to agree with DG on this matter. They know it was wrong, and they are not avoiding the issue. They are just staying away and allowing these matters to be resolved ina civil manner, not here where you vultures will totally tear apart what they say, no matter what they say.<br>
<br>
The way it seems to me is PC wants DG to come here for that reason. I mean if they wanted some sort of reconciliation they would have agreed and taken a little bit more civil approach to this, one that Ayron had provided would seem fairly adequate. But nope, not an option. PC wants DG's head on a stake, and here is where they want it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujaedengrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeden Grae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 433<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/15/01 7:08:53 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.covad.net/~blcktail/animtheband.gif width=160 height=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Grace announces new rotation policy on VS</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They know it was wrong, and they are not avoiding the issue. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Uhh...yes they are avoiding the issue.  Both on this board and theirs.  Bethanie wrote quite a few messages on DG's board that were very much to the point and free of insults or negativity and Ayron dismissed them.  I asked a simple question, would DG do this again or would they adhere to the rotation and have not received a response. <br>

Q. Do we honor the VS rotation ?<br>
<br>
1) no<br>
2) only when its our turn<br>
3) rotation what rotation ?<br>
4) Badge's we dont need no stinking badge's !<br>
5) We havent honored anything yet why should we start now ?<br>
<br>
<br>
with 150 some odd guild members they have to wait for all guild members to ratify the vote. I'd say give it a month and all the votes will be in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW only reason I posted this Im bored because AO is down (again) , and I can't believe 300+ posts and the guild leader for DG cant come on and just say - we screwed up as a guild and yes we will honor the rotation, and end this thread. <p><br>

DG, grow some balls and come out and just tell us you plan to continually fuck over the server or tells us that you feel that you were wrong and that it will NOT happen again.  This is all we want, not a few &quot;Retired&quot; guild members coming and saying they WOULD be sorry if they were still playing, or a few members trying to snow us over by attempting to change the subject every 15 posts, or Valric trying to bolster his app. into DG.  We just want a &quot;yes, we plan to do this again and again&quot;, or &quot;no, we do not plan on doing this again&quot;.<br>
<br>
Oh, and another thing...sure, I LOVE to make a DG crack every once in a while, but it is just a joke, I mean goddamn getting someone to send me tells harrassing me ingame is fucking lame and just gives me more reason to shit on your guild.  <br>

We tried that last time.  They ignored us.  Should we have just layed down and let them fuck us a second time?  I think not.  We did the right thing by bringing it here to the boards so that the rest of the server could see what they were doing (and not once, but twice).  They showed no desire to reconcile the first time, so why should we expect something different the next time?  And the rest of the server deserves to know if one guild thinks it is better than everyone else and refuses to honor agreements.<br>

Nods. <br>
That unfortunately needs time. In all honesty I know its not going to be easy. Nothing is really. <br>
It would be foolish to think that my appologies alone would suffice. <br>
Anyways, I can only do my part as an officer and hope that this time things will be different, nothing more.<br>
I will do what is humanly possible under the circumstances but hey, I am, as many of you say, &quot;a damned ranger&quot;...I am used to beatings. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

To those who missed what I have posted earlier or choose not to read it, I apologize to everyone on behalf of my guild and from myself. <br>
It is, as I have said, a mistake that should not have happened.<br>

Obviously it will take some time before the anger and suspicion towards DG will die down over this matter, that is only human.  I appreciate your willingness to share your apology with the rest of the server since everyone has an interest in knowing that E'Marr is a stable and enjoyable gaming environment.  (notwithstanding those who have openly stated that they just want to see people arguing and &quot;stir up shit&quot;)<br>
<br>
Before the next round of angry voices start, please let me warn you against backsliding on it.  You stated:<br>
<br>
&quot;We basically screwed up in not getting formal agreement with PC first before hitting VS and “swapping” spawns and for that I have apologized.&quot;<br>
<br>
We all know that it there was no contact at all with PC prior to DG taking VS (I think the statement implies that there was some attempt at discussion or at least warning about what DG was going to do) and that there was no intent to &quot;swap&quot; mobs.  What Melk said has been posted before and he made it clear that there was no &quot;swapping&quot; involved, it was DG taking the mob when they wanted and that it would continue once (hopefully) each rotation because that was DGs new position.  I understand now that Melk is not the same as Aryon but he did represent himself as representing all of DG.  And Aryon certainly did not dispute that this was the new position of DG.<br>
<br>
Your post was thorough and to the point.  Please don't blow it by subsequent posts trying to misrepresent the actions as some sort of simple mistake.  I spoke to three different people on the raid (and I know you were not one of them) before I spoke to Melk.  I was directed to Melk by the others.  So while you personally did not know that you were taking someone else's spawn (and I really believe few members of DG would knowingly do so) there were at least three people other than Melk who knew before hand that it was PC's turn and that PC objected to their actions.  But they did it anyway.  And it certainly didn't seem like DG cared about their actions until they started receiving heat from the rest of the players on the server.<br>
<br>
While I do not have any authority to speak for PC as a whole, I as an individual player accept your apology and assurance that it will not happen again.  While I can't promise that all is forgotten, I can say that as far as I'm concerned it is forgiven.  This is, of course, assuming that you were speaking as a representative of DG and we dont' see posts flying from other DG officers/elders/leaders saying that you do not speak for them and reverting to DGs previous position.<br>
<br>
There have been some posts in this thread and in another wondering how new guilds or possibly even pickup groups can break into the VS rotation.  The way a new guild gets in on the rotation is that they race to the spawn and take it before the guild who's turn it is gets there to kill the mob.  If the attempt is sucessfull the guild who's turn was taken gets the next one and everyone gets pushed back one and the new guild is placed on the rotation at that point.  I believe, however, that most guilds when told AHEAD of time that a new guild would like to try taking out VS would be willing to hold back on their turn for a while to let the new guild make their attempt.  I know I would vote for PC to wait.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, my thought is that as a way to help foster more goodwill towards DG on the server you might want to announce before your next spawn on the rotation that you will be holding off the killing of VS until the end of your 24 hours?  Maybe help coordinate if another guild or two would like a shot at getting on the rotation?  I'm sure they could use some advice, too.  Just a thought.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your post and I will look forward to seeing you in game.<br>
