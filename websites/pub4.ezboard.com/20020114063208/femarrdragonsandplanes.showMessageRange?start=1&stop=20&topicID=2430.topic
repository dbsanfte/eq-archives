Just wanted to set a rant in motion, I'm sure this has been done plenty of times before, but what the fuck. If they can still bugger us deeper they will. <br>
<br>
&quot;My God Verant it hurts!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Skull fuck. That should be the new name for the necro nerfing.<br>
<br>
So brief background, I like necros, always play if possible, first character was one, etc....<br>
<br>
If you play a necromancer, you're into manky and offensive magic, you are a master of your art, but unlike wizards, and the like, it doesn't earn you respect in most places. Infact it earns you contempt. But you are what people tell they're children about, to make them behave, and your pets are what lurk under their bed at night. It doesn't matter if you roleplay or not, this is the shit that makes people play necros.<br>
<br>
Pre-Kunark Necromancers dominated the game, and people will remember with sickness Ewle, and Ebonlore, and such. But at the end of the day, it was Verant that made the mistake, not the players, and I think necromancers were the first people to trully get the brunt of Verant VvP policy. They (VI)never really had a clue how to balance the game (and seemingly still don't. How long, oh god, how long?) and because of their initial atrocious fuck ups are now punishing certain classes (Necros, Druids....) They also completely ignore certain classes like warriors. I'm sure they're all really glad they're the standard that everythings set on, whilst they're getting the living shitz beaten out of them. Cleric backpacks anyone?<br>
<br>
But back to the main point, the largest crime, in my experience, was to make Kunark creatures super immune to necro DoTs. I find that I can get them off easily with my druid, but not with my necro, although I can run like hell if I don't as a druid, which is a major bonus. I've grouped plenty (and mainly grouped spookily enough) with both classes, but I feel like such a stand in reject when playing my necromancer, and that is certainly not why anyone played one in the firstplace. <br>
<br>
No one ever wanted to group with necros, I seem to remember, but I also always knew the mobs died faster when I was there. I even managed, whilst twitching, to get someone impressed with the class...but yay, I can be a good gimp! What do you feel for necromancers now? Pity?<br>
<br>
It's far from the concept and the origin. &quot;Players will fuck us up&quot;...yup.<br>
<br>
So, hmm, &quot;Spirit of the &lt;insert random undead thing here&gt;&quot; Self only SoW buff.

Talk to bard killah boy, he knows 0'pression. <br>
<br>
I dunno, I don't recall any major power ups to warriors. I always preferred them as tanks, maybe people just got a clue. Or maybe people used to apply the group they had to they battle fought, rather than sculpting their group/guild to it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is about necros, what fool brought warriors into it?<br>

We have a nec main in our guild.  Although I cannot say about the 50+ game (as she is 47) I like her in our groups.  Like you said the twitch is nice.  There are things they can do if you are missing a class.<br>
<br>
I guess I just try to find things for each class we have in a group.  I usually don't try to &quot;build&quot; the group.  We just get on, see who is on in guild, decide on something to do and do it with whatever classes we have.  Sometimes the group is built great like last night in Velks Lab:  (Cleric, Warrior, Ranger, Wizzy, Chanter, Nec).  It worked out allright.  We just are used to adjusting play style I guess.  Sometimes our only tank type is a Ranger...but we make do.<br>
<br>
I know necs got the shaft, I am not denying it.  It just forced us to find creative uses and made us work with what we had.<br>

Now being a fairly high level necro I can honestly say I feel quite useless sometimes. I twitch that is about the extent of my use. Sometimes i get to break out the pet on raids but that is rare. <br>
When i do get to pet I feel useful...board still but useful. Necros have become the twitch bitch class unlike verent says they dont invision us that way. I unterstand how useful twitch is but we really should have more use. <br>
Verent could improve us a few ways. Better spells on epic encounters ( new massive dots that only work on 100k mobs or something, DB and GB type dots) or fix the pet pathing. All i ask for is for them to fix pets. I am a pet class please let me be =(. <br>
People wanna rag necros cause we can solo. Who cares if we can solo. You know how I solo at 58.....I root dot a shaman with an epic could solo almost as well as I can I would bet. So give that excuse a rest. Nercos do suxk hard in the game and the recent buffing of the 59 pet goes to show that verent knows this. Please take the next step and give the little more we need to fit in =/<br>

/random pointless bitch session on<br>
Personaly the main nerf that pissed me off was our dot's only doing 40% dmg when the mob is not standing still or running away.  Thier is no way our pets can stand thier and tank a blue mob for long. so we have to fear with a pet. which means we have to find a spot where pathing will let this happen. or don't use the pet.  Perhaps it is just trying to squeeze the most dmg out of my mana, but that of course is the reason I play a darn nerco to begin with.  and one last thing. if any thing, should not posion based dot's do less dmg only if the mob is standing still?  I rember some where once reading, if you are bitten by a poisonus snake, to stay calm, I repeat stay calm, Do Not attempt to chase that basterd snake that bit you from Neriak to EC in hopes of catching it and dismembering it as this will just cause the poison to run to run into your heart faster.<br>
<br>
on raids I am actualy qute borred.  Mana, mana, mana. rarly the /pet attack, and waiting to kill my pet at any given second if my pet wants to act up.<br>
<br>
We have a wide range of abilites but few of which are usefull in a group.  even fewer that are usefull on a raid.<br>
<br>
Let's take our Dot's for example.  for soloing, thier is nothing I would rather use.  DD's are a nice to see thier HP drop quick, but I prefer the time to prepare other spells, and med mana back for the next kill.   in a group, we have few dots that are effective, most take to long to do decent dmg.  on a raid, dot's are dam near usless, sure the mobs might live long enugh for a few more of our dots to be effective. if you use one on pulled mob A, then for any reason MA yells out SWITCH, ATTACK MOB B!!.  well thier goes any hope for an enchi to mez mob A.  they can of course try to park or charm it. asuming it did not kill them if they tried to mez it once or twice.<br>
<br>
our snares are included with the dot problem, as we do not have any sort of snare that is not a dot.<br>
<br>
Our DD is not bad. rather mana inefficent, but in a group you can usualy keep it up for a while.  with the lower dmg we can launch off quite a few of them without agro. if a group is looking for a good DDer, they usualy just want some one that can get the mob form 50% to .00000004% hp in .012 seconds.  or in other words /shout Ledge group looking for wizard.  some other cast will work if we do not get a /tell from a wizard.<br>
<br>
We can Heal.  the only real rant I have about this one, which should be aparent here, but I will explain in a second.<br>
At L 8 we get our first heal woot.  an instant 30HP xfer to antother for 20 mana<br>
at 20 we get an upgrade kinda.  a 80hp xfer over 30 seconds. for 10 mana.<br>
at 44 we get an upgrade to both type of healing.<br>
we can either xfer 300hp to another over 30 second for 10mana again, or we can instantly transfer over 215HP for 200mana? for 250 mana a cleric can heal 583 HP, and they do not have to loose 583 HP to do it.  I though that necro healing was low mana cost, as we are are not HEALing, we are TRANSFERing our HP to some one else.  After we do that we still have to cast another spell to leech the HP back.<br>
<br>
But my absolute favorite necro joke is. . . . Masters of the undead.  sure we have alot of undead spells, we can fear, charm, DD, and root undead.  GREAT.  if you are garunteed to get ONLY undead mobs.  if not, that means you have 1/2 of your spell line up is just a nice pretty graphic. perhaps it is just me, but I tend to find that switching spells in the middle of combat a bit ineffectual.<br>
<br>
Ohhh, and we can Mez, for 15 seconds, with recast time we can only hope to keep 2 mobs under controll.  not to much to bitch about here, aside of the pray your group can kill mob A before mob B or C resists you once, because once one gets away they both will, least for a little while.<br>
<br>
not that this is only true of necro, maegs, druids, and any other class that has XX type mob specific spells has that limitation.  kinda turns us into less the master of, and more of the Can kill Draco Litch solo, and die to a fire beetle with a hang over. or is just kinda an OK soloer.<br>
<br>
personaly I think any class that can &quot;Specialize&quot; in a type of mob should have an extended set of spell gems for thier specific mob. seriously, would giving a necro 2 more spell slots for undead only spells make them unbelivably powerfull? yea probly, aginst the undead, as they should be.<br>
<br>
Personaly I still love my necro, and I still will probly always play my necro more than any other class.  It just saddens me to see my fav. class phased into the, you were to powerfull on your own, and we want you to group more even if thier are few groups that want you, and you do not fit in to the &quot;prefect&quot; group at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, I am sure I made little sence in this, and I am quite tired, but I will post it any way, despite somthing telling me I should just delete it all and type it back out when I can think better. bahh, it is my honest, yet grogy feelings.<br>
<br>
Can any one tell me when was the last time verant made a positive change for necros, aside of fixing somthing the screwed up in the first place, IE FD bug, or the &quot;pet agro&quot; bug?<br>
<br>
Lastly, I would like to say, necros are not prefect, they never were perfect, and they never will be perfect. to many people have to many ideas of what they should or should not be for that to happen. but they could be alot better than they are now.<br>

Not just one that you have to do different things in different levels but every single group is a different way of playing.  I've been main healer/mezzer/charmer for an entrance KC group...always had full health during a battle....and always had more than 50% mana...and the tanks always had 50% health during the battles. (no deaths)<br>
I've taken the tower of KC with a group and broken 5 mobs at once and I was group mezzer/charmer.(cleric died half way through....fell off the tower got agroed by other mobs)<br>
Been back up mezzer for the 42 enchie who gets resisted by everything....and the back up healer for the druids.<br>
Pet tanked in an all caster group<br>
<br>
The necro is really useful in every group...but we don't specialize in anything.  Yes we are supposed to be Masters of the undead...but up until the 30's the clerics get better undead spells...and the undead spells are horribly mana inefficient until the 49 one...at which point your evocation is dreadful and your lucky if you can get the spell just not to fizzle.

We don't get our fixed duration undead charm till 60.

<br>
Ugh open your spellbook and get a clue Brinen.<br>
Go on some raids, learn how things work then think about that comment again.<br>
Sure, we may not be the *BEST* class to have on a raid, but we certainly can be helpful during those &quot;times&quot;<br>
<br>
You know, the times where clerics and sham's have 40+ people to buff and run oom fast?<br>
<br>
Or as Soulraven pointed out, feeding DB wizards so their damage output is doubled if not more, capable of reaching 50-60k damage if not more with the help of a high lvl necro and Infusion.<br>
<br>
Darn those 40 people you helped buff in a reasonable amount of time died under the feet of some nasty dude...all summoned in under 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Or how bout snare+FD or DoT+CoTH+FD pulling? Someone has to do it, mobs in velious walk away at the same time and can be very tough for monks to split.<br>
Doubt i have to explain this to you with your infinite necro class wisdom.<br>
<br>
Trucidation.<br>
We can blow shit up when we gotta.<br>
<br>
Vex+SB<br>
Every mob pulled, smack em with a vex then hit a random tank with SB, quick HP's regen on a tank never hurts.<br>
Same time youre not losing any, any in 60 Lich with SB ticking. And doing some extra damage to the mob.<br>
Simple tactic you should know...<br>
<br>
FD+Rez stones!<br>
Crap raid is getting wiped out.<br>
1) Kill pet<br>
2) Make sure your /assist auto attack is OFF.<br>
3) Find a safe spot if possible and FD. If no clerics managed to camp out rez one.<br>
Or...(hoping the mobs dont see invis)..Pop up and hit circ of shadows praying they dont agro. Drag corpses to a safe loc and rez a cleric. This keeps you from having to summon everyone and having to fight back to wherever you got wiped out.<br>
<br>
Pets!<br>
unfearable...kewl!<br>
<br>
I cant believe people think even feeding mana might be futile. You may not notice but it saves ALOT of time during prebuffs.<br>
<br>
Do i need to teach you how to solo as well Brin?<br>
<br>
If we suck so bad play another class. I get sick of people saying what we can and cant do when they dont even know the basics.<br>

Everyone in a raid plays only a limited aspect of their class streamlined to make the raid more predictable and more successful.<br>
Even warriors must play differently on raids. They have to be more careful if and when they taunt, etc...<br>
You can't judge or rate a class based solely on raid performance.<br>
And people who call raiding the end game are misleading people. The game is what YOU make of it. Raiding may be the end game for some people. <br>
But Necros can still solo mobs and zones where other classes at the same level cannot.<br>
When is the last time you saw a tank soloing in skyfire?<br>
<br>
When you started your character, you probably didn't start it with large raids in mind. If you started a necro thinking anything other than it will give you the freedom to play without neccessitating a group, you should smack whoever provided you advice. <br>
<br>
Sure you have been nerfed more than other classes. But ninety percent of Necro nerfing took place in the first 9 months, the same time as all the other classes were nerfed. <br>
<br>
You could say that necros suck, but they can still Solo all the way to sixty even post nerfs.<br>
You could say that necros suck on raids, but<br>
You could say that about all the classes if you tried. <br>
Every Class has its place on large, well planned, raids. It is not always the same place it would be in an xps group. <br>

Being the character whose main role is corpse recovery after failed raids is also not fun...  What if the mana transfer spells were never added to the game - what would your role on raids be?  Mana transfer is not a &quot;necro&quot; ability - it was just added because Verant recognized the relative uselessness of necro spells when fighting level 65+ mobs... Even if there were new dots added that were silimar to DB / GB you would still run into stacking issues if you had more than one necro there... <br>
<br>
Now if necro's were like this from 1-55 then fine, I don't think anyone would be complaining, but the way a necro plays changes dramatically post 55 (unless you solo primarily) - this is what so many necros are mad about - you don't want to play a class for all those levels just to have its fundamental playing style change to a weak support class.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umayteira.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mayteira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/25/01 2:14:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Necros</span><hr size=1> Necro's don't suck..it's just frustrating to have spent all this time  working on it...and find out most your spells don't work on mobs..most time on raids you can't use your pet...and you are only there to twitch....which on alot of raids does not improve the buffing becuase our twitch hardly does anything.

In my opinion to make necro's viable in raids is to just give us an unresistable lifetap. That ain't asking too much is it?<br>
