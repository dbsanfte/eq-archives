so I made a new Gnome Warrior, named Gnomezzillah.  After about an hour I made it to level 3, then got ported to West Commons.  I then went to East Commons because I know billions of bored auctioning people would be at the tunnel, where I could ask them to try things on.  I started small, asking to try on a RyGorr Tunic here, see what an Executioner's Axe looks like there.  I even convinced a newbie to let me try on her Flowing Black Robe, even though I couldn't wear it as a Warrior.  I then gave everything back so people wouldn't think I was a scammer.<br><br>After being asked for SOW (um...is there a gnome class that can cast SOW?)  I asked a level 34 warrior in full crafted if I could try it on, because &quot;I never seen a gnome in plate before!!!&quot;  and when another gnome warrior ran by in Fine Plate, &quot;I never seen a gnome in BLUE plate before!!!&quot;  So he was hesitant and said that he would let me try it on, but he didn't know me, and that since I was only level three, he coudln't be sure that I wouldn't just keep it and log off without a reputation.<br><br>So then I said that I had been playing for 2 days, and that for me, level 3 was an accomplishment and that I would never do anything that would force me to have to start over.  Then the newbie said that I could be trusted, because she lent me her robe and I gave it back.  So the warrior (who I'm very tempted to name but I guess its not very nice to make fun of someone) puts all his crafted in a backpack (how courteous of him) and gives it to me to try on.  <br><br>So then I run around the tunnel saying &quot;HAHAHAHHA&quot; and for about five minutes I refused to give it back.  So then he said he was going to petition a GM, but I said I didn't care because GM's never do anything.  Then I sat down like I was camping and he started to curse at me in tells.  <br><br>Three minutes later, i decided that I would start auctioning it.  So I auctioned a full set of visible crafted for 200 pp for the set, and someone who happened to be sitting next to me said that they would buy it.  So he was getting really upset and I took off all the crafted and put it back in his backpack and told him I sold it, but that was ok because now I could buy us BOTH a set of banded.  LOL<br><br>Then he sat down and said he was sad and was camping, and to just keep the 200 pp because I just ruined what took him a year to earn.  So then I gave him his stuff back cause I would have felt really bad if I actually kept it.  He wasn't pleased that I had scammed him but he said that he was never going to let gnomes try on anything ever again.<br><br>At least he learned his lesson.  I have done my good deed of the month.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>My main's name is Angello, lv 51 Rogue by the way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utelly003.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telly003</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/19/01 11:55:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Scamming Experiment</span><hr size=1> Sorry, I see no humor in being mean.

You people act like I'm some kind of monster or something!  It's not like I pretended that my name was Renee, and was sick with some disease and wanted to see a really cool looking gnome before I died.  And it's not like I got his stuff, used my new &quot;twink&quot; for three weeks, levelled him to 30, decided I did not like being a Warrior and then gave him all his stuff back out of boredom.  I had his stuff in my possession for all of...let's see, 7 or 8 minutes?  That's hardly ruining someone's entire day.  I spend more time than that zoning in Velious.  The Warrior was not in a bad mood personally when I gave everything back, he just decided that Gnomes are evil (LOL sorry gnomes).<br><br>Secondly, I did not do this with some intention to teach anyone a lesson.  I did it to satisfy my curiousity.  I wanted to see how easily a polite (yet reputationless) character could get his hands on a bunch of stuff, and from what I learned, its pretty easy.  From what I saw, the Warrior was already aware of scammers and proceeded to let himself be scammed anyway.  So yes, a side effect was that this Warrior (and hopefully my amused audience) will be less succeptible to scammers, which hopefully will prevent them from having to come to this forum to post about real scammers.  <br><br>As for people getting &quot;revenge?&quot;  As long as its on the same level and I get my stuff back...go for it.  I'll find it amusing, and then you can post about it wherever you like.  <br><br>As for compensation:  My Rogue is half way around the world, and with my zoning rates, it would have taken me an hour to get to ECommons.  I don't know about you, but I dont' see how a level 3 untwinked gnome could have raised 100 pp fighting spiderlings.  And being that I never roll on something I cannot use unless no one else can use it either, its not like I even have that much pp to spare.  I'm still in full Ravenscale for crying out loud.  But, thats because its a game, and I do not care.  <br><br>As for Ysall and her &quot;kindly&quot; motivations to try to ruin my EQ life based on this post... grow up sweetie.  1.  Its a game, loosen up a little.  2.  I happen to be adored by those people who really know me, THANK YOU and I will have no problems grouping or guilding.  <br><br>That is all.<br>Angello<br>Ugly Retextured Half-Elven Rogue of the 51st Shadow<br>Will continue to lock Darmus and other Warriors in the Freeport Bank in exchange for 1 pp whenever possible.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>Aren't warriors easy prey? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhoppkins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hoppkins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/20/01 4:59:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=299.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Scamming Experiment</span><hr size=1> QUOTE<br>----------------------------------------------------------At least he learned his lesson.

In MY opinion, this was a low thing to do. Granted he recieved his items back, but how used do you think this guy was feeling?<br><br>"Ahh, sorry, I was just trying a little experiment. Might want to be a little more careful next time"<br><br>No matter HOW nice you make it sound, you used him, and took advantage of him.

You know, the one where you make sure you get something for your trades cause if you are scammed, tough shit.  I trust people I know, and only people I know.  I won't let anyone I don't know see anything of mine unless I don't really value that item too much in the first place.  Thats why you wont' see me posting that I was scammed.<br><br>I find it interesting that this 10 minute masquerade of mine offends you (general audience) far more than it did the Warrior in question.
