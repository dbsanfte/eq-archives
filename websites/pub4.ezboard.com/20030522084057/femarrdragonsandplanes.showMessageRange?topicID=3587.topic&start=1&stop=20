<br>
One one hand you have those who feel that by using a network of others keepng a particular avatar on line they have the &quot;right&quot; to the next RF spawn.<br>
<br>
On the other hand you have those who put their efforts into an attempt to time the spawn and show up within a specified time frame.<br>
<br>
So far I have seen a great deal of both general and personal rudeness on both sides...name calling, guilt trip tactics, blatent slander.  If this were a political forum I think the applicable term would be mudslinging.<br>
<br>
My quandry is this:  <br>
<br>
It is a well known method of camping the RF spawn to either have several people rotate logging in the avatar while the person who pays for the account sleeps/works or the person goes AFK and relies on others grouped in the zone to maintain the camp.  There are various permutations of these themes, but by and large I think it pretty much covers how a camp of several days is accomplished.<br>
<br>
How is this more &quot;right&quot; than the person, for whatever personal reasons, chooses a different method of capturing the spawn? ie: timing it.<br>
<br>
As far as I know RF is the only &quot;camp&quot; where the actual person who pays for an account can claim legitimacy of camping even though it is a fact that no one person can possibly maintain an active presence over a period of several days.<br>
<br>
It's also been demonstrated that the cleric community has so far been unable to create a system to ease the process of aquiring their epic within the framework set up by VI.<br>
<br>
The real problem with this whole issue, as I see it, is that personal agenda's are constantly getting in the way of resonable behaviour.  <br>
<br>
We have many examples of things that should get people banned from the game and yet are becoming acceptable actions to &quot;protect&quot; a camp.  People training the dispelling mobs over groups forming up and buffing while their people are still trying to get enough in the zone to beat them to RF.  People training mobs over other clerics who are in the zone in order to force them to &quot;respect&quot; anouthers &quot;camp&quot;.  Forming -real- KS groups who wait untill some other group kills the human RF then attacks the triggered dragon.<br>
<br>
Then you have those who interpret the mere presents of a person of anouther guild or even of particular guilds in the zone to be an intent by that guild to KS their camp.  And RF isnt even &quot;due&quot; for several days.<br>
<br>
I have personally witnessed all of these actions.<br>
<br>
Add to this mix that guides and GM's don't have a really consistent process for dealing with the RF issues.  Or at worse they don't seem to adhere to any process.<br>
<br>
Lets try this...next time you are &quot;camping&quot; RF, don't throw a fit when anouther person shows up in the zone.  Have at least one person of your &quot;camp&quot; log eveything.  If that person, or group of people start making directed comments that they actually intend to KS, then you have a legitimate reason to call in a guide.  If all they do is come sit and &quot;observe&quot;, you do not have a rational excuse to do or say anthing provocative.<br>
<br>
Because they have every right to be in that zone that you do.  This is not a red server after all.<br>
<br>
And lets be rational.  There is a difference in opinion about camping.  Your beliefs are really no more or less legitimate than the next person/group.<br>
<br>
Trying to force your way on others in this matter is really not a lot different from real life.  Look at Northern Ireland or Bosnia as examples of conflict created due to differences of belief.  You can also look there to see what happens when people hold onto ideas based on perceptions of history rather than a more &quot;evolved&quot; theory of personal interaction.<br>
<br>
If you do not have a killing force in zone at the time of the spawn, or can't get that killing force in place within a reasonable time...say 30 min's, then unless the other people are willing to extend more time to you, you lost.<br>
<br>
There is no other spawn in this game that attempts to grant legitemecy to a person who isn't actively at that spawn.  And claiming that you have been camping RF for xx days is really admitting that you personally have not been actively there.  Given human psysiology, there is no resonalble claim that &quot;you&quot; have been camping RF for several days.<br>
<br>
It's at that point where I think you lose the argument of a claim to RF to a person who chooses to &quot;time&quot; the spawn within a few hours.<br>
<br>
And just like you, this is my opinion.  Nothing more and nothing less.<br>
<br>
Your rational comments are welcome.  A continueing dialoge may help resolve the issue.  Best case would be VI actually paying attention to a player base that has a rational presentation including a better seolution than the current situation.<br>
<br>
Personal attacks on my &quot;honor&quot; for not &quot;respecting&quot; your opinion will be laughed at.  If thats all you can say then don't bother.  But you will.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time.<br>
This is a personal opinion, and should not be thought of as any groups stated position. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2081<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/28/02 6:49:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3587.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RF Question</span><hr size=1> Oh boy.

<br>
I personally wish guilds could agree the terms for a server wide rotation, accepted by all guilds, and end this minefield of acrimony and recrimination.<br>
<br>
Personally, I live in an idealised world, where the person who has served their time at the camp, ofton for days on end, has their camp respected, subject to the restriction you made below.<br>
_________________________<br>
If you do not have a killing force in zone at the time of the spawn, or can't get that killing force in place within a reasonable time...say 30 min's, then unless the other people are willing to extend more time to you, you lost.<br>
_________________________<br>
<br>
The fact that more than one person might have looked after that avatar is not that relevent.  Even if friends, guildies etc have taken over every now and again so you can sleep, eat, or just plain rest, I bet you that the true owner of the avatar will still be the person who spent the largest chunk of sleepless time at camp.<br>
<br>
The tone of you some of your post suggests you beleive that the person who has been there for 5 days straight, has no more right than the person who turns up 5 mins before the spawn.  That just seems to substitute natural justice for a 'might is right' approach.<br>
<br>
I wish all the clerics (who only need rage for their epic), would submit themselves to a serverwide random to determine a queue order for the spawn.  With the exercise not being repeated for the next set of clerics until all those clerics had got their epics, or failed trying.<br>
<br>
I'd probably impose a minimum cap too, say level 55.<br>

Basically it would be a bunch of care bearing people hand in hand standing around the ragefire spawn in a big circle, and some would have shirts that say &quot;Magister&quot; and others would have &quot;Midnight Fury&quot; and &quot;Affliction&quot; and &quot;Kaizen'X&quot; and so on and so fourth, and then you'd have the occassional smaller guild incapable folks with them, and they'd all be smiling and dancing around the spawn, complimenting each other, saying &quot;Oh please, oh thank you&quot; and stuff... blah...  Well some folks need to realize that guilds don't think that way.<br>
<br>
Maybe another day and another Ragefire Rotation Hippies thread I'll get one up.<br>

(not that Emarr needs more druids anyways =/)  Thus, if druids can &quot;almost&quot; heal and become the cleric, cleric's aren't needed, thus fewer cleric's, thus fewer epics.  Love the way they're thinking.  I feel for ya Evelle, that was some crap you had to take.  I think VI owes you an epic.<br>

My guess is that VI will make RF a triggered mob alla Faydedar, Xenevorash.<br>
<br>
If you haven't noticed, VI has been caving to about every demand made by every class lately.  Dot stacking, druid CHs...etc.<br>
<br>
The game is so old and so unbalanced(broken) as it is I'm sure the fight to keep cleric epics from coming into the game too rapidly is very low on the list of VI's priorities... they are gearing up for EQ2. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46329"><img src="http://www.netwalk.com/~loki/signaturevara.jpg"><BR>60 Iksar Grandmaster<a> - Shackle of Tynnonium - Celestial Fist -<BR>

<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
By what right do one group claim ascendency over anouther? <br>
<br>
One one hand ya gots those who feel dat by usin' uh network o' others keepng uh particular avatar on line dey gots da &quot;right&quot; ta da next RF spawn. <br>
<br>
On da other hand ya gots those who put they efforts into an attempt ta tyme da spawn an' show up within uh specified tyme frame. <br>
<br>
So far I gots seen uh great deal o' both general an' personal rudeness on both sides...name calling, guilt trip tactics, blatent slander. If dis here wuz uh political forum I th'o't da applicable term would be mudslinging. <br>
<br>
My quandry iz this: <br>
<br>
It iz uh well known method o' camping da RF spawn ta either gots several peeps rotate logging in da avatar while da person who pays fo' da account sleeps/works or da person goes AFK an' relies on others grouped in da zone ta maintain da camp. There iz various permutations o' deez themes, but by an' large I th'o't it fine ass much covers how uh camp o' several days iz accomplished. <br>
<br>
How iz dis here mo' &quot;right&quot; than da person, fo' whatever personal reasons, chooses uh different method o' capturing da spawn? ie: timing it. <br>
<br>
As far as I know RF iz da only &quot;camp&quot; where da actual person who pays fo' an account can claim legitimacy o' camping even though it iz uh fact dat nahh one person can possibly maintain an active presence over uh period o' several days. <br>
<br>
It'salso been demonstrated dat da cleric community has so far been unable ta create uh system ta ease da process o' aquiring they epic within da framework set up by VI. <br>
<br>
The real problem wiff dis here whole issue, as I see it, iz dat personal agenda'siz constantly getting in da way o' resonable behaviour. <br>
<br>
We gots many examples o' things dat should git peeps banned from da game an' yet iz becoming acceptable actions ta &quot;protect&quot; uh camp. People training da dispelling mobs over groups forming up an' buffing while they peeps iz still trying ta git enough in da zone ta beat dem ta RF. People training mobs over other clerics who iz in da zone in order ta force dem ta &quot;respect&quot; anouthers &quot;camp&quot;. Forming -real- KS groups who wait untill some other group kills da human RF then attacks da triggered dragon. <br>
<br>
Then ya gots those who interpret da mere presents o' uh person o' anouther guild or even o' particular guilds in da zone ta be an intent by dat guild ta KS they camp. And RF ain't even &quot;due&quot; fo' several days. <br>
<br>
I gots personally witnessed all o' deez actions. <br>
<br>
Add ta dis here mix dat guides an' GM'sdon' gots uh really consistent process fo' dealing wiff da RF issues. Or at worse dey don' seem ta adhere ta any process. <br>
<br>
Lets try dis here...next tyme ya iz &quot;camping&quot; RF, don' throw uh fit when anouther person shows up in da zone. Have at least one person o' yo' &quot;camp&quot; log eveything. If dat person, or group o' peeps start making directed comments dat dey actually intend ta KS, then ya gots uh legitimate reason ta page in uh guide. If all dey do iz come sit an' &quot;observe&quot;, ya do not gots uh rational excuse ta do or say anthing provocative. <br>
<br>
Because dey gots every right ta be in dat zone dat ya do. This iz not uh red server afta all. <br>
<br>
And lets be rational. There iz uh difference in opinion about camping. Your beliefs iz really nahh mo' or less legitimate than da next person/group. <br>
<br>
Trying ta force yo' way on others in dis here matter iz really not uh lot different from real life. Look at Northern Ireland or Bosnia as examples o' conflict created due ta differences o' belief. You can also peep dere ta see what happens when peeps hold onto ideas based on perceptions o' history rather than uh mo' &quot;evolved&quot; theory o' personal interaction. <br>
<br>
If ya do not gots uh killing force in zone at da tyme o' da spawn, or can't git dat killing force in place within uh reasonable tyme...say 30 min 's, then unless da other peeps iz willing ta extend mo' tyme ta ya, ya lost. <br>
<br>
There iz nahh other spawn in dis here game dat attempts ta grant legitemecy ta uh person who ain't actively at dat spawn. And claiming dat ya gots been camping RF fo' xx days iz really admitting dat ya personally gots not been actively dere. Given human psysiology, dere iz nahh resonalble claim dat &quot;you&quot; gots been camping RF fo' several days. <br>
<br>
It'sat dat point where I th'o't ya lose da argument o' uh claim ta RF ta uh person who chooses ta &quot;time&quot; da spawn within uh few hours. <br>
<br>
And just like ya, dis here iz muh ma fuckin opinion. Nothing mo' an' nuttin' less. <br>
<br>
Your rational comments iz welcome. A continueing dialoge may he`p resolve da issue. Best case would be VI actually paying attention ta uh player base dat has uh rational presentation including uh bettah seolution than da current @#%$. <br>
<br>
Personal attacks on muh ma fuckin &quot;honor&quot; fo' not &quot;respecting&quot; yo' opinion will be laughed at. If thats all ya can say then don' bother. But ya will. <br>
<br>
Thank ya fo' yo' tyme. <br>
This iz uh personal opinion, an' should not be thought o' as any groups stated position. Jus' like Orenthawl James.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=292890">Oumadar Greatness</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3587.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3587.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3587.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3587.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3587.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3587.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3587.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3587.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
