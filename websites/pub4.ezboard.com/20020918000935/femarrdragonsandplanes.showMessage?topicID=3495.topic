Thanks PC and GL</span><hr size=1> This isn't a KS by by normal definition, but I think todays Ragefire KS was just as bad.<br><br>I woke up early today and got in game before noon to see a buncha Ater Draconis guildies in Skyfire where our cleric has been patiently awaiting Ragefire's spawn. I wasn't aware that epic mobs spawn between 24 and 48 hours of a server reset, but I was made aware of this fact and immediately grabbed a port to Skyfire. there were about 12 or more AD people there at the time, and 3 Phoenix Crusaders sitting nearby on the platform.<br><br>the PC people reminded us numerous times that the first to engage with a force to kill Ragefire got him (and also that fear kiting doesn't count - duh) We kept getting people to come to SF as they came online, and PC did the same, but only got a couple extras. The day progressed with our numbers increasing steadily, while PC had only a handful of people when out of the blue this single Cleric and Rogue, unguilded, showed up and proceeded to sit down right in the middle of our melee force who was loitering around Ragefire's spawnpoint waiting for him to pop. When asked if the cleric and rogue planned to take Ragefire by themselves, The cleric told us that he was going to kill the mob with 6 manaburn wizzies he had nearby ready to come help him out.<br><br>Arguments took place, a petition was done, our cleric spoke with a GM, and the GM came out to have a look around. In the end she basically told us that the first group there to gain aggro that had a sufficient force to take him down would get him, and that if anyone else petitioned about anything Ragefire related she would come back and TL us all out of the zone. She also said we had to figure it out ourselves.<br><br>We were alright with this, cause by the time Ragefire popped and he could call in his wizzies, we would have him dead anyways. I knew, though, that the GM shouting her verdict to the zone would cause PC and anyone else to bring in more people, and that's exactly what happened. PC got more people, we brought in everyone that was available, and slowly others started showing up. For a long time it was Ater Draconis, Phoenix Crusaders, and a few single people hanging out. We had no problems with this either, since we had double the people that PC had. Slowly, more people came. Greylords arrived. By this time I had been there for about 9 hours, and I was getting a little ticked off.<br><br>Throughout the day others had come, found out we were there with a good sized force and wished us luck, showed a little respect for a fellow cleric, and left. Divine Grace swung by, and said if we couldn't take him down and wiped, then they would. No biggy, we weren't gonna fail.<br><br>100 freaking people in Skyfire. 45 of them belonging to Ater Draconis, about 20 to PC, and 25 to Greylords, plus a few others. We're all a little angry, cause PC and GL people are mixing about us, trying to get near RF spawn, hoping to draw aggro. PC and GL decide that &quot;hey, we're both big KS guilds, let's join together and give AD a choice. Either they can join with us and we can do a 3 way roll on the epic piece, or they can take their chances and fight to kill him before we can&quot;<br><br>Not liking their attitude nor their lack of respect for anyone else in this game, we decide that no, we would rather take our chances. After a while we finally decided that yes, we would have a better chance if we joined them, and when we told them this, they started to change their minds and not want any part of it anymore. Another GM was called in, and he/she forced everyone there to do a roll. It wasn't just a 3 way roll between 3 clerics from each of the 3 guilds there with the force, there were I believe 5 clerics who rolled. Our cleric lost the roll, and we were forced to leave.<br><br>A guild who had members camping rage since Sunday morning, who had a large force capable of taking rage since the very early afternoon, a guild who sat around trying to get a SINGLE cleric his click stick to help our guild grow, and another guild who spent about 1.5 hours sitting there gets to kill rage based on a guides random.<br><br>I can't imagine how our cleric felt to lose because of a bunch of selfish people in a couple guilds who have no respect for others who play this game. All I know is that I felt like I was the one who had been camping the mob. I felt like I was the one excited all day long because I was 100% sure I would have my epic part that day, and had my hopes completely crushed. How many click sticks does PC have? 7? they can't let another guild have a single bloody cleric epic? They said somethign about their cleric losing ragefire many times in the past. well what do you expect when you don't put any @#%$ effort into camping the mob? Greylords, wow, it's like being lvl 35 and walking into SRO and seeing the AC standing in front of you with noone around, and being able to barely solo it and get your Jboots. Total bullshit luck.<br><br>Why can't you people evolve a little and show some respect? Ragefire is a FFA mob, fine, but if you come in and see 50 people from 1 guild there, and you have 20 people, you would think you would leave it and come back later, not pull the BS you did today. That's what I would do.<br><br>I did not make this post because anyone in Ater Draconis wanted me to. Most people were silent when I said I was going to most, and a lot of them told me not to do it, but I was pissed off enough that I had to do it, to remind others what assholes a lot of you guys can be. If you want to get pissed at someone over this, get pissed at me, but I don't think you have the right since you guys have no class and deserve whatever heat you get for your actions.<br><br>If anyone from these guilds wants to tell me not to blame their guild, stuff it. I forget which of the 2 guilds it was, but the leader from one of them said he was leaving the decision totally up to the cleric on wether or not they would steal rage away from us. If anyone in the guilds doesn't agree with what they did, and do on a regular basis, why don't you do something about them? When they say they're off to KS some small guild and ruin their chances for a click stick cleric, tell them not to do it. Or leave these guilds and join a decent one with some good people. I like phat lewts too you know, but not if I have to put up with a bunch of assholes 24/7.<br><br>Comments welcome. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br><img border=0  src="http://www.tbaytel.net/scaryf/images/everquest/epicsig.jpg"><br>Check out <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138154">my stuff</a> at Magelo.com!<br><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=razer>Razer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/25/02 7:41:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire KS'd again, with a new twist.

If 50 people from a guild are there waiting for him to spawn, and the cleric has been there for 5 days waiting, I don't think 20 peopel should be allowed to waltz in and in 2 hours have a gm come and say &quot;you 50 people just wasted an entire day, and some of you wasted 5 days sitting here thinking ragefire was yours when he was gonna pop. This guild who got here 2 hours ago is more uber than you, they have big zones they have to raid and you are all ordered to leave so that they can try and kill him when he spawns.<br><br>Read the other Ragefire FFA thread. THE ONLY GUILDS who throw around the FFA thing when dealing with rage are guilds like Phoenix Crusaders and Greylords who can't be bothered to actually spend time camping the mob. they come in and whine, and cry, and muscle their way in if they can, and won't be astisfied until they are the ones walking away with the epic piece, regardless of who they have to screw over to get it.<br><br>This wasn't all about the GM making a piss poor call, this was about people not showing respect for other people.<br><br>If your guild was up for VS, all ready to go in, and suddenly another guild appeared beside you and they were getting ready to move in to kill VS, what would you do? would you get a GM to come in and solve it and then let it go when the GM rules in their favour?<br><br>Remind me how a VS camp is different than a RF camp, please.<br><br>This isn't like the AC in sro we're talking about, he doesn't spawn anywhere randomly in a zone, it has a single spawn point, why can't it be a camp?<br><br>I know, the guides and GM's have rules they have to follow, so as to not anger people or seem unfair to some. But those rules anger people just the same because the rules make the gm's completely useless. Half the time their ruling is in favour of the person(s) who are in the wrong, because some stupid rule about not having camps in the game makes it so they have to random and @#%$ over other people.<br><br>Picture a woman sitting in a restaurant, waiting for her lunch to be delivered to her table. She's got the table, she's sitting in the chair, she got there first and wants to eat her lunch. Some woman who is waiting in line to be seated sees the waiter bringing the food out, so she dashes across and pushes the other chick out of her chair onto the floor, and starts to eat her food. A cop eating nearby sees this, and stops her. He then pulls out a coin, flips it, and calls &quot;heads... you, on the floor, get your stuff and leave... sorry about that maam, enjoy your lunch&quot; and then he walks away. Does this seem fair at all? course not, it would never happen, but every day in eq the guides make stupid calls like this because there is some rule saying that you can't call a table in a restaurant. if some person comes along and is big enough to fight you for it and take it away, he has the right to it. <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br><img border=0  src="http://www.tbaytel.net/scaryf/images/everquest/epicsig.jpg"><br>Check out <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138154">my stuff</a> at Magelo.com!<br><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utoxxthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toxx The Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 646<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/25/02 8:52:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Razer, I feel for you and your guild.

I agree someone who sits there X days (with a group capable for it) should have the camp, but the people who run the game can't force that or they'd lose customers.<br><br>Granted the party who came in later and won the roll shouldn't have either taken a roll and should've able to realize what was right and what was wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=razer>Razer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/25/02 9:35:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3495.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Kordail, either way they can lose customers. :P<br><br>what's worse, losing a customer who has no morals or respect and likes to ruin the game for others playing, or losing a customer who respects the other players and what they do, and is a nice person?<br><br>I think they would and do lose more people due to things like epic mob ks'ing than they would by telling those people who do the ksing to stop and respect other people.

She was a cleric and had been camping RF for DAYS.  I caught a port over and sat there to keep her company for 95% of the time she was there.  At LEAST half of her guild was always on and there, geared up and weapons raised, prepared for RF.  <br><br>Then out of the clear blue another guild shows up and DEMANDS to have the camp, claiming that (uno, singular) ONE cleric had been sitting there invis all the time.  &lt;coughs&gt;  BS<br><br>Of course this was not true and even if it was, first to engage that can successfully take em down gets em.  Yes, one single low level cleric is going to stun and nuke RF to death :P  However (naturally) this caused problems and a GM at the time was called in.  His decision, if I remember correctly, was simple ... that /ran crap.  LUCKILY my friend's guild won and the GM asked the other guild to please leave (mind getting old, starting to forget names <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  <br><br>As hell would have it, that SAME guild showed back up a couple hours later with about 10 times the force.  They had recruited another suck ass guild to help them KS.  Another petition was made, unfortunately RF spawned and was KS'ed, leaving my friend high and dry, before another GM ever responded.<br><br>I, myself, felt like I had just been neglected of my epic piece.  Days gone down the drain because of a guild who has no respect for others.

Finally, you get to the front of the line.  You KNOW you will get your ticket.  You've got the cash in hand, and you are so close to getting your ticket, you can taste it!  All of a sudden, another group of people, some having tickets, come in and start pushing their way in to buy a ticket.  Lets throw in a 3rd group comes in and starts pushing their way around too, with a few already having tickets too.   A member of the staff of the stadium comes out, and announces they are almost out of tickets.  They don't know quite which group was their first, so they decide to roll a die to see which group gets the last of the tickets.<br><br>How fair is that?  Is that a good analogy for you?
