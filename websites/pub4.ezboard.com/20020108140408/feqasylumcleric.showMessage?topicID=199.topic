I've been told that there are HUGE differences between the way that clerics play at high levels vs low levels.  <br>
<br>
Can anyone let me know what they are, so I can start practicing?  I've learned that I need to keep a low level heal spell memed at all times so that I can quickyl heal a caster who has drawn the ire of a MOB. <br>
<br>
I tend to keep root/enstill memed so that I can root a MOB that the chanter is having a hard time mezzing.  Though I am not an expert at this yet.   Usually, I concentrate more on healing the chanter than preventing damage.  <br>
<br>
I'm pretty good at timing my heals to get the most bang for my buck in healing spells with tanks.  I haven't gotten Complete Heal yet, but I understand there's a whole new learning curve involved with the use of that spell. <br>
<br>
I'm not super-concerned with being the most UBER mana effiencient cleric in the game...  But I'm more concerned with being dependable and competent first.  <br>
<br>
I've got my channelling up to max for my level, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Heh, just kidding .. I think you'll learn as you go what is efficient, and what's not.<br>
<br>
You should also remember that while you are there mainly to heal the damage done to your party, there are others who can either prevent that damage (kiting Wizards or Druids, mezzing Enchanters, etc...), or direct that damage a certain way (tanks, mainly).<br>
<br>
As for Complete Healing, it indeed requires a slightly different usage, mainly because of the casting time (10 seconds) and the effect (total heal for target), relative to other healing spells. While it takes a little fine tuning to get this spell under your control, it's not too difficult, I have found myself. I would recommend you try to get the feel for it in a &quot;low risk&quot; situation, when your party is in what I call R&amp;R mode (fighting easy battles, really). Inform your party that you do so, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Basically, it's learn as you go ... it's not too hard, really, especially if you have a party in which you know each other. <p><br><A Href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=30878"><IMG

I cannot add much to Kaysha's statements, as they pretty much describe the transistion from pre-40 to post-40 (the level where things really start to change) cleric. I can only add that you will notice signifigant changes to how you operate in groups at 40, 46, 50 and then pretty much watching yourself fine tune your skill slightly with every level thereafter.  Basically, dont sweat it.  Take controlled chances and see what works and what doesnt. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=45014">Dalnarek Lifeinstater</a><br>

I think the biggest change is that you will now be the primary healer in your group...ie you can't spend 50% of your mana on nukes *in most situations* cuz you will need it to heal.  It of course varries from camp to camp and sit, but as a general rule I think that's the biggest change.  There is also a post on the forums about timing heals...take a look at that. as for CH definatly use it in a low risk sit...I had a higher lvl cleric in my group when i got it and he recomended at 2 reds to start CH...so try it and see what works and see what doesn't...all clerics have different healing styles and you only get that by learning and doing.<br>

Solo.<br>
<br>
Soloing may not be the best thing for a cleric, even though we can solo undead, and other mobs with low hps, but soloing can prepare you take a chance on being hit. How to handle getting pounded on and how to be calm when its happening. Its very important NOT to panic. This strategy also helps you see how the mob hits you and avoid being interupted when you cast that heal. Once you see and know how the mobs hits, you are morelikely to get your heals off while you are being hit. Remember, if you are knocked back from a hit while starting to cast, GO BACK to where you started the cast and YOU WILL regain your concentration on your cast, however, you must be aware of how you are being hit, how much dmg you can take, and the location you are standing incase you are moved by the mob.<br>
<br>
When in group, I have always maintain a calm behavior when a mob starts beating on me after I just dropped what the mob considers a big (agro) heal. This gives the enchanter time to mez the adds. Its very important you buff yourself exactly the same way as your tanks. So you are timed with them when thier buffs are off, that way, you wont lose so much mana in consecutively healing them cause all of a sudden their health is dropping too fast.<br>
<br>
When using root and stun, your lowest level works far better and less mana. I use this to keep a mob off the enchanter again, so he/she is safe to mez. <br>
<br>
/assist key. tanks are not the only ones who uses this key. I use this for different types of purpose. I assist the enchanter as to know who they are trying to mez, if it mez doesnt stick the first time, its faster for me to root that mob if more than one comes along.  <br>
<br>
Faster heal comes along with hot keys. Use hot keys on almost all of your heals and the players on your group. I use keys to target a player and another key for heal/root/stun.<br>

<br>
I DIDN'T know the trick about returning to the point where you were knocked back from.  Interesting.  <br>
<br>
I think the biggest challenge I have to learn is in making the hard decision to let someone die.  I think that is the hardest part of being a cleric.  For example, a puller without feign death comes back to the group with 6 fast hitting monsters on him and only 2 bubbles left.   Several times, I've healed the puller anyway, KNOWING that the train would derail on me, but unwilling to give him up.  Sure enough the train derails and I die, leaving the group without a healer.  Shortly after that the enchanter follows, followed by the puller and then the lead tank.  Logically, I know that I shouldn't heal the puller in that situation, but my heart won't let me do it.   <p><BR>

<br>
Clerics are plate classes for a reason. They are built to take some punishment ( things like lord fleshak not included <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
If you can get your Hitpoints up, and your Armor Class up, WHEN that train derails on you ( not if, when.. cause its gonna happen sooner or later ), you can stand there and chuckle as the mobs swing vainly on your plate covered butt, and the enchanter mezzes them all.<br>

In the high end game, the cleric WILL decide who lives and who dies in any given encounter.  Post-51 you will notice your strategy change quite a bit also.  The addition of Celestial Healing and Remedy make it much easier to keep everyone alive.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you already know, but the most important player in a large pull situation (especially raids) will be the enchanters.  I always like to keep the main enchanters hotkeyed with heals on plane raids.  It is also a good idea to keep the main and secondary assist hotkeyed with /target in case their cleric dies.<br>
<br>
As you practice on your way to 60, you will learn what works best for you, but the aspect of multi-group raids will likely be the single largest change in strategy, and possibly the biggest source of frustration for many levels.<br>

Complete Heal is our class defining spell. Nobody else has it, and nothing else comes close as far as healing efficiency goes. (Well, they say that the res is the most efficient heal used on ranger so that may be exception... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <br>
<br>
 If they ever nerf CH or give it to another class, there will be a lot of clerics hanging up their Cat Hats** (tm)  in the corner next to their sprinklers.<br>
<br>
 (** replace with &quot;Pointy Bucket Hats&quot; if dorf, &quot;Alien-ate-my-face Hats&quot; if DE, or &quot;There's-a-pigeon-on-my-head Hats&quot; for human...) <br>
<br>
In comparison, learning CH timing is kind of like learning to ride a bike. The only advice I can give is start using it as soon as you get it and practice. After a while it will become instinctive.<br>
<br>
 You shouldn't really rely on any set rule that tells you when to start CH every time, because that point depends on the damage rate of mob and the HP of your tank. You just gotta get a feel for the damage rate for each type of mob you fight. You will realize how long your tank will live and will know when to fire off that CH so that it lands in time. (or doesn't.... muhahahah!  j/k )<br>
<br>
To learn the craft, I suggest start conservative in every situation, and then push the limits from there. Meaning, up untill you are certain of the damage rate, start your CHs earlier (maybe half HP), then push them further to the left as much as you can while still feeling comfortable about it. This requires that your victim... err, I mean your tank trusts you, and wouldn't get all bent out of shape if something was to go wrong during your learning process. In a controlled environment (1 mob, steady damage rate), you could get it to a point where your CH lands while the tank is in the purple haze. I don't suggest you do that in regular groups, but its good practice as well as a rush for both you and the tank if the tank doesn't mind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Just start using it asap. Tanks at your level most likely won't have enough HP to make it really efficient and you won't have mana for more than a few per full mana bar, but the experience will be worth it when you get into your 50s.<br>

then again those are my poinions and i think you should just play it out for yourself, and yes practice with complete heal.  cheal aint worth it (imo) for healing any tank lower than 50, but that doesn't mean that that is the time to start learning how to use it. <p><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=38556>Ainur Thalion, 49-2 cleric of Forgotten Horde</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uisyssreigns.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isyss Reigns</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/5/01 11:02:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High Level Game vs. Low Level Game</span><hr size=1> Being a good healer doesnt really require much but it generally points to the direction of knowing your party, mob and zone. <br>
<br>
Each of your groupmates holds a specific duty and specific tactic. In High Levels, I expect each member of the group to know what they need to know. Each Warrior is different. Never assume that a warrior can withstand the damage. Some may , some may not, it'll all depend on their Equipment and level. Granted we do not have the time to check every single equipment they have on, the easiest and fastest way to know these things is knowing their HPs before and after YOUR buffs, and always ALWAYS play it safe in the beginning to get a feel of each individual in your group. <br>

That's easily prevented Donrod, don't heal at all!<br>
<br>
Really, lots of good advice here.  Though I don't recomend soloing much, this is a social game after all, soloers usually get burned out rather fast.<br>
<br>
Just talk to your tanks, see what works, see what doesn't and learn from your mistakes.  Try to keep the people that are most critical to your group fully buffed (tank, crowd control, you possibly).  Also, it should be a primary concern to keep your enchanter at full health as much as possible, since they can drop fast in a hairy situation, when you need them the most.<br>
<br>
Always keep Divine Aura up, mem Divine Barriers also if you're getting nasty agro often, but usually just the quick, level one DA is good enough. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulittlecherub.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Little Cherub</A> at: 10/5/01 7:23:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugtath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gtath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/6/01 11:09:49 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.blizzard.com/images/broodwar/popup/corsair.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: High Level Game vs. Low Level Game</span><hr size=1> Fantastic advice here.

I've seen a few clerics out there who panics when a mob jumps on them when they start healing and mostlikely, forgot to heal after. <br>
<br>
Practice what you can to expect what will most definitely come in the higher levels, you WILL get hit whether you like it or not. But the question is, will you be able to handle it?<br>

Also a big key at higher lvls for all classes though esp cleric and chanter, don't freak out.  You will get hit, there will be bad pulls, and there will be times you are standing there wondering if your will live and if the evac will go off or the chanter will get it under controll.  I think that's a significant part of the high lvl game too.  Especially if you are in dungeons....a lot of low lvling it seems is done outside and in a worst case you all bolt for the zone. At higher lvls you will end up in dungeons some time as a cleric, and then you have to be rdy to deal with being hit on etc.  <br>
<br>
If you have big issues with being hit go to a random very green camp and agro them all and just stand there and get smacked a bit, try to get off a few heals and see what it's like.  At higher lvls it's kinda expected that you know if you are agroed you wait to have the tank or chanter get it off you and not run around like a chicken with it's head cut off.  You should be able to take some hits as a cleric, not like tanking but if you get smacked a bit you should be okay with it.<br>
<br>
I also wanna say that at the higher lvls there are even kinda two different games there...the below 55 game and the above 55 game.  The later being a whole other ball game with the raids you do etc. <p><center><img src="http://students.washington.edu/zip/eq/misch.jpg"></center>
