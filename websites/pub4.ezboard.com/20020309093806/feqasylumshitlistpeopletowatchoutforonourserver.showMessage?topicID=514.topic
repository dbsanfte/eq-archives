So I guess to those of you, this is just a heads up..*<br>
<br>
Looking for a weapon in EC i run across Sonedarin selling a sword I want. We negotiate a price, and I head to shady to meet him. He volunteered to have a fiend come down to transfer the sword from his main, Dandate. But he said It would take time to find someone to help him out. I asked him to grab his main, so I could see the weapon. He did, and the weapon was there. I then asked if I could pay him and complete the trade. He said No, I need you to pay my alt.<br>
 Now, I have always been a trustfull person, and at that time the thought did cross my mind to just give him the pp on faith and have him grab the sword from his main. But, i decided against it. We sat there for quite awhile and BS'd, talking about his school and the game. After about a half hour total between our first conversation and then, I decided he was trustworthy. He obviously didnt have anyone near to do the trade as he had told me, and I didnt feel like waiting all nite. So I gave him the long trust spiel and he said things like " I could never dishonor my guild" and " Stealing you dough would be jacked, bro". Sealing the deal for me. Yes a true Con man. I gave him the 8kpp and never saw him again. I am sitting in the same spot the trade went down and its been 3 hrs. <br>
 Petition.....? I did! But,Bah what will they do? Slap his hand? I have talked to at least 15 people in /tell in the last hour after I announced the incident in /shout and 5 of those have also been charmed and ripped off by this guy. All of which petitioned and still no action has been taken w/ him. So here I am, with nothing more than a warning for future traders. Stay away from this guy.<br>
 And anyone else who has experienced this guy please post. I know he uses diffierent alts in each deal, I have heard 4 alts names tonite. I wont post them because I cant confirm the names and I wouldnt want to tarnish the reputation of an innocent party.<br>
And thats, that!<br>
<br>
Bring on the flames....Yes It was partially my fault for trusting him. BUT I have done it 100's of times before w/ out incident, and so have many of you!. People other than myself have been screwed, I think He needs to be here!/shrug<br>

Regardless of the fact that you took a risk, it's never fun to get ripped off.<br>
<br>
People should be aware of those who scam others, and act dishonorably.<br>
<br>
And sadly, as you said, it's also the easiest thing to avoid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Don't do third party trades and you won't have this problem.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Part of what pisses me off when I see these posts is that it's so avoidable and I hate seeing low life bottom feeders profiting from scamming others. Plus I often wonder how many people turn around and do it to someone else because they got fucked in a deal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
At least you checked and saw he really did have the item, most scammers don't even have the item.<br>
<br>
A minor suggestion: often there are many people in the EC tunnel area. You may want to have a well-respected higher level person middleman/middlewoman the trade. I came from a game called Realm that had no trade windows. Most people used MM/MW known for their honesty to mediate trades. We were well known and respected. In fact at one point in that game I held the record for the highest amount of items traded honestly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We got a small percentage (5-10% of purchase price) for our services. Personally I did it for tips only. People could pay me or not since I was there trading items anyway. <br>
<br>
Many well known higher level people from guilds that have well established reputations, as well as a good guild reputation I'm sure would be willing to assist in a trade, and you're less likely to run into problems there. <br>
<br>
Though the best way to avoid *any* problem would be to only do direct trades <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

I have played Realm since 97 and though I play EQ mostly now, I still play Realm occasioanlly just to keep up with friends.

I have talked to his guild leader (Zanthar) and he said that when he spoke to dandate, dandate replied that his hard drive broke and he couldnt get on to give me the lammy, that i gave him the ring and money for, i new that was BS.  Later I then found out that he did the same thing to Dreladek.  Maxim and everyone else please send me a tell in the game and we will share information about this.

Last note (and sorry to hijack) but I returned to Realm a few months ago with a new account to take a look around. /sigh Most of the old timers and people I knew had left. The game didn't feel the same. Even Lady Polgara took down her site and moved on /cry. I don't know what happened to my character Hazelstone, or the person I gave her to. Ah well. When I first started playing EQ though my main was Hazel Stone and I used to get quite a few tells on other servers, HEY are you Hazelstone from Realm? I have Hazel on this server, never got one tell from Realmies though. It's been over 2 years since I left though. <br>

A lot of this game is based on trust and when someone constantly breaks that trust I think it is time for the GMs to step in and stop it, I know they can and will do that on occasion, and I sincerely hope that they feel that this occasion merits it. <p><b><font color=red>A terrible thing happens if you are not careful.<br><font color=yellow>Are you Careful</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujekakiril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeka Kiril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/11/01 6:15:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OK i guess</span><hr size=1> I recall that day, Brutil...and quite a few other days as well.<br>
<br>
Two people stood up for Dandate too, saying he would never do such a thing and that he's a cool person.<br>
<br>
These people might be in on the scam too, but their names escape me. I spent a good week and a half in EC, and it appears Dandate is on a roll. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There hasn't a day gone by where someone shouts &quot;Watch out for Dandate, he took my shit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Definitely someone to watch out for... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uellysor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellysor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/11/01 7:48:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dandate/Sonedarin...thief</span><hr size=1> This guy will be very hard to catch. I've been looking for him since I received the first tell about this lamentation and still haven't seen him on. Last time I saw him when I did a /who all fall was the day BEFORE I learned about the case <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . He was on only for like 10-15 min and was /roleplay. <br>
<br>
Since he seems to have several alts and he knows many players are pissed at him atm, it is likely he will only play his alts (if he ever logs at all) for a few weeks. As long as Dandate doesn't log on, I'm afraid only Frizz can do something.<br>
<br>
As for the guild tag, you can be sure he won't keep it if we can catch him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
