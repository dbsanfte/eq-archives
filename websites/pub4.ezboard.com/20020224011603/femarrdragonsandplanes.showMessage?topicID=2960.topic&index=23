It's comments like that flared this post...even after I said I was sorry and did not know the spawn was taken you guys still continued with your &quot;haha to fucking bad for you&quot; after day 3 of trying to play nicy nice with you guys despite all the attitude I got. <br>
Had a couple of friends say &quot;Hey no problem let me log on my Mage and we can solve this matter&quot;<br>
But instead I gave up under the assumption that you would concede the camp eventually. well it's day 6 now of bieng at the camp from 10:30am EST or so untill way into the wee hours of the night. Trading off of one another so you keep your monopoly. I would of been done with the camp in a few hours all I wanted was some small bricks of acrylia.<br>

as far as the respected part..respected for what? can I ask thier sheer numbers don't mean anything to me or should they to anyone else.<br>
<br>
I don't doubt that there are some nice people in the guild with that many people it's impossible not to. The odds are against me on that one. (although it has been a REALLY long time since I have met someone in PC with enough character to make me change my mind on you guys).<br>

<br>
There are numerous exemple of camp being owned by a single guild for weeks. This happens and will continue to happen. The point is not here.<br>
<br>
The point is that you come here, make a rant against Dem, and associate the whole guild in your rant and cursing at us. This is where you went wrong. <br>
<br>
You want to settle a camp dispute, settle it in game with the person involved and any officer of the guild. Chances are that any officer will tell you tough luck anyway. But dont bring that here if you dont want to be assassinated verbally by the whole guild concerned. Especially when you flame us in this manner.<br>
<br>
2 things that you said that realy amazed me. You say you were hunting bandits in 99 with PC's guild leader?? Could be, but in that case, I am sure a whole lot of us would remind you as we are still playing. <br>
<br>
And you said that you let your own guild outside of this... Well, take your own counsel and let our guild outside of this if you dont want to have the whole PC mad at you...<br>

If the issue here is that Dem won't share spawns with you and you had in fact approached first Dem(which it sounds like you did) and then an elder(see Mismorts offer) then I stand by the guild in that you would have had a resolution.<br>

Instead you come here and try to impress the Jerry Springer crowd with your witty writing.  And in addition to that YOU started the guild mudflinging.  Your guild(Vivix Protectorate for Enquiring Minds) has what I always thought of as a good rep too, it is unfortunate that it has now had, on at least two occassions, board trolls try and spoil that image.<br>

That's all fine and good, Ray...but how often do you see folks here complaining about PC?  Hmmm...almost never?<br>
<br>
That's because, like you, we aren't impressed with our sheer numbers.  We're impressed with the way we treat folks over time.  <br>
<br>
How many times have we backed off dragon runs or plane raids or other such endeavors in light of other folks/guilds' considerations?  I can't even begin to count them.  We have worked hard to be decent to others and to take their concerns into account.<br>
<br>
I honestly feel the lack of flames against us on this forum is testament enough to that.  The fact that non-guildees have come to support as well only strengthens that.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt you are going to come up with a number of people complaining about &quot;PC ego filled blow hards&quot;.  The reason for that is that we aren't..plain and simple.  <br>
<br>
Maybe you had a disagreement with one or two guild members, but you attempt to sully our whole guild's rep.  You say you don't represent your entire guild...Guess what, neither do one or two of our own members.  Please try to resolve your disputes in game with the folks involved.<br>

He's not &quot;crying&quot; about the lack of ability to get at the camp.  He's pissed because of the crap-ass attitude he got when he killed something.  Full-pop, he sees no one there, he pulls something and proceeds to get verbally assaulted in public channels.  <br>
<br>
How do I know?  I'm his wife.  <br>
<br>
He's upset that for the past 6 days, 24-7 someone has been there and he's waited rather patiently.  Hey, look, no one is there...Finally!  Then he gets screamed at and called names.  <br>
<br>
This is probably the first time, with maybe the exception of telling Shardon to STFU that he's posted an out and out flame.  He's pissed.  He's rightly pissed.  <br>

<br>
Take a look at PC's charter.  Then look at the instances, in the past week, of at least one group of members (no matter how small that group may be) of insisting that the whole zone is theirs, training people and then starting to shout and /ooc insults at someone who pulled a mob when not a SINGLE one of them was visible.<br>
<br>
Other measures were taken before Ray came here.  I spoke with one of my council members who has an alt in PC.  Two days later, no changes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rants and Flames is a place for people to vent, let of steam and yes, to flame the hell out of those that piss them off.  <br>
<br>
In any guild, if you choose to show that guildtag over your head, you are representing the guild.  You are no longer a single entity.  If I run out and act like an ass with my guild tag on...What do people think?  They immediately associate me with my guild.  So when those few Phoenix Crusaders members decided to start name-calling in public channels, they did it representing said guild.  <br>

But by that argument, Ray should be posting his own guild's allegiances here, yet he states that he and his guild should remain separate in this issue.<br>

Now, having said that....I still stand by my previous statement that if there were wrongdoings, perceived or not, no one should really feel entitled to public slandering and mudslinging until they try to resolve matters in private and with the guild leadership.<br>

That, apparently, was not done, and that is why I feel this rant is not appropriate.  Granted, this IS the rants and flames section, so I should probably take it all with a grain of salt.  <br>

You just wanted your 15 min. of fame.<br>
<br>
If you wanted action, you would have spoken to someone in PCs about this (and as you have stated we have MANY members, i doubt you could have been on in a time when there were no others on besides Dem).  If you wanted action you would not have slandered a whole guild because of your frustrations w/ one member. (tell me now, who sounds like the frustrated 12 year old?)  FRUSTRATIONS you took NO measures to resolve, like an adult.<br>
<br>
How can ANYONE take your post seriously? I definitely can't, and I doubt any member of PCs can, now.  How can we when you just called a guild full of people you don't know, loot whores?  I'm sorry but I DO take offense to being called that.<br>

I don't know, seems imporobable at best that he wouldn't have logged on and done / all demvarwen or whatever to see if the guy who had been camping it was in the zone to save himself the trouble of going to the camp.<br>
<br>
He just logs on sees an open camp and kills it...after being frustrated for 6 days by someone else (and his friends) camping a camp he wants to target- I dont know seems a bit fishy to me.  More like log on &quot;YEAH spawn up my camp fuck em&quot;...and killed the mobs.  <br>
<br>
I really dont know though...just making assumtions from the sparse information posted here.  Once again I will make my point.  Should have brought it up with a guild elder.  Then at the VERY least the information would be there for us to make an informed judgement on the situation at hand.  <br>
<br>
One last thing Analorne...from the posts your husband has made about Phoenix Crusaders, it seems to me had already had a predisposition to not be happy with anyone in PC.  Thats not too cool...seems pretty close-minded to me.  Never met your husband in game, and have nothing other the positive from my experiance with you Analorne.  I just don't get the hostility.<br>
<br>
<br>
I donno I guess I just don't understand the pixle madness some people have....must be the pot.<br>

I think it's simply frustration.  It was a week of getting some pretty crappy treatment.  <br>
<br>
It takes a lot to get him worked up to that point.  So I think it was a combination of things over time.  It's my understanding he's had some past bad experiences with some other guild members.  Simply put...this was the straw that broke the camel's back.  <br>

Um, no.  That sounds like some huge animosity built up over a long period of time.  That being the case, it seems Ray has a history for not talking to the proper authorities.  I know whenever I have trouble with KSers, ninjas etc etc the first thing I do is go to a guild officer, not R&amp;F.  <br>
<br>
Now, I had heard nothing but good things about Ray up until this point.  He is definately frustrated and probably did snap.  But after his second post he definately had time to think about it and should have seen that he went to the wrong place to seek a solution.  <br>

Perhaps this could have been resolved by one party or the other looking for blocks in a different spot.<br>
<br>
Ray, you say you are a nice guy and are known throughout the server as being a helpful kind of guy.  Maybe you are, but your first post does not reflect that.  Calling Demvarwen a &quot;fucktard&quot; and calling PC a &quot;ghetto guild&quot; does not really set you up for anything constructive.<br>
<br>
In any case, I feel this is a moot point, considering you can get your item in a different area, hell in a different zone.  You don't even have to hear the &quot;attitude that resmbles that of a sexually frustrated 12 year old who gets caught masturbating in class.&quot;<br>
<br>
So have fun, be happy, get your blocks.<br>

From an outside observer (to this specific incident--not completely neutral as I do know Raypierre from guild alliance, have raided with him and found him generally to be calm, cool, a decent raider, and a nice guy) it appears a little bit like “where there is smoke, there is fire”.<br>
<br>
CAVEAT:  I do not know nor do I have any pertinent information to the alleged incident.  I have no hidden agenda here, I am actually curious why the massive and noticeable response from PC when other people say they are honorable and courteous and this issue really is about one member, not the guild as a whole anyway.<br>

If he just wanted to rant about Dem I would have more than likely just had a chuckle and read another post.<br>
<br>
Wanna know what kinda loot whores are in PC?  A bard in our guild recently gave(yes gave) a white scale to another bard in our guild.  This allowed the second bard to complete his Singing sword.  The first bard did this because it benefited it the guild to do so, and because the two bards have been friends for a long time.  This is not the first time that I have seen members of PC pass items on to others, pass on a roll for loot, or even win loot in one zone and pass it along asap to someone else.  Calling this guild a group of loot whores is not only outrageous to the point of hilarity it pisses me off.<br>
