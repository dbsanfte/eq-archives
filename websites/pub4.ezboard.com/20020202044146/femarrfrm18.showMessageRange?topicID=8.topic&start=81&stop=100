That's a pretty hateful thing to say. I'm sorry you feel this way. I've read alot of your posts on various subjects and they almost always come off as violent with religious undertones or implications. I'm not going to hunt through all the post on these boards but I hope that someday Milibis, that you, personally, seek out professional help. Maybe you should look inside your heart and search for the enlightenment you so strong urge others to find.<br>
<br>
I also disagree with your statement that there is no &quot;American ethnicity&quot;. I'm not going to go on a long tirade because you are well within your rights to that opinion, that's what America and being an American is all about. Freedom.<br>
Freedom from oppression.<br>
Freedom of speech, thought, etc, etc.<br>
Sure, there are some people among the masses that don't seem to uphold these values that America was founded on, but the Truth shall always stand: that you will always be Free, no matter what.<br>
<br>
People are well within their rights to express their rage, to not do so would trivilize this whole nasty ordeal. This is an unprecidented tragedy that's never happened before. (Don't compare this to Peral Harbor, this is much much worse) People will strike out and hurt Americans from the Middle East, there's no way around it. They are hurt, violated and scared and unfortunately that's their only outlet to gain back a sense of security. In my mind it's not right, it's misplaced rage that could be better spent helping the injured and dead and rebuilding New York.<br>
<br>
You cannot condemn people for feeling rage over this attack.<br>
I want retribution as much as the next American, but I'm waiting for the facts, undeniable proof of who did this. Then we can focus our hatred on the real cause of our pain, not the people from the areas speculated this attacks orginated from. <p><center><b>Kinzix Kryx'Vkahl</b><BR>

Think of the last time you had a real good blow out with a loved one.  The country is filled with a lot of shock, pain, and sadness.  These emotions are what are called primary emotions.  What usually follows primary emotions is, of course a secondary emotion, this is usually anger.  As people get over the shock of what has happened we will see more and more anger.  People are going to make very angry and generalized statements.  Anger is a very natural phase of a grieving process.  We have a whole country grieving right now.  My own father has made statements that have surprised me.  Since I was an Airborne recon scout in the 82nd Airborne, US Army for years he called me for speculation on what our response would be, and if I thought I would be recalled.  My father is a good “turn the other cheek” kind of person, but I heard him say things like “Go over there and make a big smoking hole in the ground!”  I know my father is a good man, I also know that he really doesn’t think that we should do that but he is angry and feeling helpless.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is the USA and everyone has the right to free speech, whether that is mindless comments on what we should do to the Middle East or throwing religion in peoples faces.  And to you Miblis the really sad thing is that you don’t even realize that you have used your religion as a weapon.  The bible (or any other holy book or creed) can be as dangerous as a gun.  BTW I have studied the bible in a few theology classes and have never come across the 10 levels of hell before.  That kind of talk in itself is very hurtful.  These people who are posting these things are venting feelings.  Is it right to tell people how they should feel?  I can relate, after seeing what had happened I also wanted to put on my uniform and look for some one to pay for what had been done to our country, I think that’s a natural response.  Having a feeling or even talking about it is not a crime.  While I will support your right to say and feel what you will, I will also support others rights to say and feel what they will.  The thing that will make this a really long thread is that no one will ever be able to convince you that what you have posted here is wrong.  No matter what anyone will say or post you will keep coming back with “It’s not me that is saying this it’s God.”  That’s pretty convenient for you.  Correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t the bible (and most other major religions) teach that you shouldn’t judge?  Well I’ve said my piece.  <br>

Your point, so far as I can tell, is that Miblis can only make such remarks because he lives in a country which believes in free speech, and that in some other countries he would be targetted and hurt for making them.<br>

My point is ... surely it's a GOOD thing that America is not an oppressive regime?<br>
Would you RATHER live in a country where you couldn't say what you thought?<br>
Should we attack people who take advantage of free speech to say controversial things?<br>
<br>

Wail my friend, ...Wail and gnash your teeth, shake your fist, stomp your feet and torment us with your threat of eternal damnation.  Please, point out to all of us for the umpteenth time the fact that not all Arabs are bad people, and that not all Americans are saints.  While you are at it, spend a moment telling us that water is wet, the sky is blue, and that Kevin Costner really cannot act.  Take your time and think of any more things you might be able to tell us that we already know.   Meanwhile I'll think of the young couple jumping from the WTC to their deaths with their hands clenched, and watch contentedly as the US lashes out at those who dared.  Whether it is 50,000 of the Taliban, or the whole godamn country of Afghanistan really makes no difference to me at this point.  <br>

I truly enjoy watching people attempt to win arguments on this board, especially those with indefensible positions.  I mostly enjoy the part where they expound on so much pointless drivel that they contradict themselves over and over and eventually dissolve into a puddle of incoherent goo.    <br>

Not only do you come to criticize a nation at a time of extreme pain, but you take joy in the extra pain you inflict.  You make a game out of death...you revel in it in your own cowardly way..you hide behind the fact that you know none of us will never see you or know you in real life.<br>
<br>
If you had to speak these words to us..to our faces..you would balk sir..for you are the epitomy of a coward and lowlife.  You haven't the heart, the guts, or the balls to think for yourself, or the tact to know when to shut up.  You remind me of the kind of asshole who would go to a funeral just so you could tell the widow that her husband cheated on her 20 years ago you little slimeball piece of shit.  And calling me and others posters here unpatriotic..hell that was about the most idiotic thing I think I've seen you do on these message boards..and you've done a lot of em.  I had to actually fight back the anger here on my end and I had visions of choking the life out of you with an American flag you worthless ass..thankfully I'm a pretty level headed guy and came back to my senses..as soon as I realized you aren't worth the piss it would take to put you out if you were on fire.<br>
<br>
You seem to want to elicit a response..maybe you get off to it..I don't know..but the more that I read your misguided and malinformed ramblings the less I feel you are who you say you are.  I picture you as being a bit more of a &quot;young teen angst&quot; type that gets his jollies by being &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;confrontingly compassionate&quot; like his other little buddies told him to because it would be so cool!<br>
<br>
I've had it with responding to you..as you have lost any and all stock and interest you had on these boards..you sir..if you are old enough to be called sir..are quite simply an ass and a extremely sad individual that you would persecute others in a time of pain for your own enjoyment.<br>

<br>
Well, I myself don't feel hurt whatsoever at this point, at any responses I am receiving here.<br>
<br>
We have a lot of different groups here.  We have those who think I don't have any right to express my feelings.  We have those who say I am an asshole, interesting.  We have a very small minority who actually see where I am coming from.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear, that is the only way I could see such a large majoirty of people untactfully attacking me with absolutely no thought.<br>
<br>
Let me explain "<b>The Bottom Line</b>(TM)" with an analogy I think everyone can relate to.<br>
<br>
Our beloved country of America has more or less, issued somewhat of a statement.<br>
<br>
That statement is that all countries who do not wish to back the United States against the enemy, do not condemn terrorism.....and are the enemy.<br>
<br>
In more or less words, that is what the Bush Administration has stated.  I think it is a good statement, and a fair statement.  It is my assumption that Bush is meaning the governments of those countries, not the actual...countries.  Anyhow....<br>
<br>
If you disagree with my stance against people who welcome genocide/racism in this world, that means you also welcome genocide/racism.<br>
<br>
You might not like the graphic nature I presented it, but a group of you seem to like the graphic nature that Justicia, and others put their feelings.  Just in less words.<br>
<br>
You agree with me, then you wish for revenge against those who committed this act, and not their people and children.<br>
<br>
You disagree, then you will probably join the 7 people I mentioned originally in burning hell.  You want genocide?  I believe that God will make you pay for that belief.<br>
<br>
On that note, let me explain to you something that happened to several of my friends mothers the last few days.<br>
<br>
On one instance, my Libyan friend's mother was in our local mall.  She was buying shoes, and some fellows surrounded her and began throwing out some interesting slurs.<br>
<br>
"Sand-nigger"<br>
"Desert-fag"<br>
"Arabic shit"<br>
<br>
Apparently these people were in line to buy something, then saw her from a-far and ran up on her.  So it wasn't like she was right there in front of them, and their anger and rage took over.  They went out of their way, to bother her.<br>
<br>
A similar thing happened to a covered Islamic woman at a grocery store here.  In addition to the things which happened to the other lady, the guys who surrounded her here followed her to her car, and she left crying.<br>
<br>
Now I know most Americans aren't like these people.  I know I am not.  (oh yeah, if you forgot, I am American...born here, remember?)<br>
<br>
However, that select group of people, who are growing everyday....they aren't real patriotic Americans.  Nope, they aren't.  They can be angry, they can rage...thats fine.  However its hypocritical as a COUNTRY, to be racist to anyone.  This country, is a little over 200 years old, and is made up of all other countries, as far as ethnicity goes.  So for these people to do that, make them....well I have said it before...filth.  A walking contradiction.<br>
<br>
I feel terribly sorry for them.  When I heard about those things that occurred in the city I live in, it nearly threw me in a rage, because these racists aren't standing up for anyone in particular.  These people don't know what Americans are.<br>
<br>
I love America.  I love patriotic Americans.  However, if you say you're American, and you state that an entire race should die, or you harass people of another race....you're not a patriotic American.  As a matter of fact, you're less then human.  You're a dog, and you deserved to be chained to a fence, watching real Americans live their life <b>free</b>.<br>
<br>
Don't claim you're American, and pull the bullshit I see on this thread, and what I hear is happening on the streets.  You're a disgrace to America, and you should have all human rights taken away from you.  You're a rabid dog.  You have the intelligence of a dog.  You lack any sense whatsoever to carry the state of an American.<br>
<br>
I'm not God, and I never claimed to be.  That would be not only ridiculous, but offensive for anyone to claim they are God.<br>
<br>
However, if I got to choose who went to hell, and who didn't, frankly, I know who I would choose.  Racists.  All shithole racists.....American, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Canadian, Israeli.....etc.<br>
<br>
Racists deserve to burn in bloody hell.  They already lack a soul on this earth, but hell will certainly take away anything else they thought they had.  I know that a lot of African-Americans can see my points, can you?<br>

You came out against peoples reactions to this event, when in reality you are upset at the racist treatment your people are recieiving which is totally understandable.  But you have to realize something, these people posting here are mostly angry and upset and can't express themselves properly, they aren't really racisit, yes maybe some of them are and do wish hate on any and all of your people, but thats not all of them, not all of these people wish genocide, pherhaps genocide of those responisble (which is vastly different).  All and all I think there was a misunderstanding of how people feel and are expressing their feelings.  I think we should all step back and think things over and spend time with our families.  Lets not haste to judge those we call our neighbors and countrymen.<br>
<br>
I don't have the answers to everything but I think we need to step back and take some time to get out our emotions, before we all come on here and start throwing insults and slang, and the like.  I for one am sorry for some things I said in haste, but thats what they are, words in haste.  <br>
<br>
Take some time and hug your family, and let your emotions out...God bless<br>

Who the hell are you to determine whether America can claim ethnecity. I am a product of all these things but the sum total is I am an AMERICAN. I do not think people should wish for genocide or the erradication of a country. I however looked at the people dancing in the streets on the north bank, and was filled with a horrible realization that I can no longer value any of them as human beings(this was a scary realization for me). I looked at them and realized that if someone opened fire into all of them I would only grieve their wasted lives (not wasted by being killed as I think they honestly do not care about life theirs or others, but wasted in their own stupidity and twisting of Islam)<br>
<br>
You feel that people responding in anger and saying shit they do not mean(I pray they do not mean it as it would lead to the same zealot'd thinking that created these horrors)Is a hell worthy sin, I am very happy that I do not follow whatever twisted belief system you do.<br>
<br>
I do not like humanity. I do however value human life. Do not ask me how this works just trust that it works for me.<br>
<br>
I look at what the world may have in store for us. I am convinced that there will be a horrible price extracted for the atrocities performed. I am convinced that innocents will die to pay for this. I however will have my sense of loss at seeing the innocents die softened by the wondering of exactly when, where, and how, all the people killed ceased being innocent.<br>
<br>
I believe the price of innocent life to end the threat of terrorism in the world is an acceptable price to pay. This includes the innocent people killed in the WTC Pentagon and the planes as well as whatever innocents killed in the war against terrorists and terrorist countrys. I pray that it will end it I do not wish any to die but I accept that people have died and will die to make the world a better place.<br>
<br>
I however do not want to see people die to satiate American bloodlust(which I will not say is wrong people got a right to want blood for blood if thats the way they feel).<br>
<br>
I also pray that you Miblis look at the people around you and value them. I honestly think that you do not as you callously spout forth the ways they will suffer in YOUR hell because they spoke out in anger and stupidity(I am not calling anyone stupid I just think people spoke/typed before they thought). You sit there and condemn these people to their cells of hell, yet I see no condemnation of the people who performed these acts. <br>
<br>
You are arrogant, self righteous, and loudmouthed(all these terms describe me as well) and you have NO GODDAMN CLUE WHEN TO JUST LEAVE SOMETHING ALONE. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualekzandr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alekzandr</A> at: 9/14/01 1:47:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umiblis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miblis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/14/01 1:50:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> To Poppen</span><hr size=1> <br>

Alexzandr said this:<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>You sit there and condemn these people to their cells of hell, yet I see no condemnation of the people who performed these acts. </font color><br>
<br>
The very beginning of my post, stated that Osama Bin Laden should be treated worse then anyone in hell, ever, for what he, has done in the past.  In ADDITION to that, anyone else responsible for the New York city, Pentagon, and Pennsylvania tragedies need the same level of torture.<br>
<br>
These people need to die.<br>
<br>
You want condemnation?  I stated it before, but here, I state it again.<br>
<br>
Walk out into your world and watch how middle-eastern Americans are suffering to see fellow Americans die IN ADDITION to racism toward them.  Walk out into your world, and my world.  Please see it, then if you wish to judge, judge then.<br>
