It was already said many times before that it was NBG and we had 2 warriors in the group at this time, but of course everything else that had dropped was total crap.  Scootie then continued pulling while everyone else was talking about how she must be joking.<br>
After taking care of these pulls she finally rolled only to get a 19 to Toehammer's 90+.  At this point she was apparently trying to offer some kind of trade to Toehammer so she could keep the gaunts, instead of just giving him the loot, but he refused her trades.<br>
The next thing we know 2 more dogs pop, she backs away from the mobs after the rest of us started attacking, she sits down, and then we get the message that she has been removed from the group.  This whole time she had been the group leader, so she was not kicked out and none of us received a message that she went linkdead.<br>

Hah. &quot;Seniority&quot; loot rules, hahahaha.<br>

Sorry to hear this happened, definitely not a cool thing to do. Nor very wise, if you ask me.<br>

I just hafta laugh though, &quot;seniority&quot; loot rules. Where the hell were they back when I used to camp the cappy for hours upon hours. Oh yeah, my ass was there a lot longer than 12 hours, and I never did win gaunts.<br>
<br>
Just a word of advice if you are in fact reading this, Scootie. Friends = everything in EQ, I may not have had luck in winning gauntlets, but two friends of mine are the reasons i'm wearing a pair today.

and on another note...<br>
<br>
Every group i'm in with scootie always ends up with the first pull being WAY too many, and everyone dying...this has happened more than three times...<br>
<br>
<br>
...one would learn after that that this person isn't that great..'cept for the Mamochan thing, woot.<br>

Needless to say we were all shocked, when she said there would be no roll for the gauntlets and she was keeping them. Due to her just invented &quot;seniority&quot; rule. Everybody kept asking her if she was serious and letting her know none of us agreed with her. I guess we made her feel guilty enough, she decided to roll for them. More likely, she figured there was a 50/50 chance of winning them honestly and not looking bad. But since she lost the roll and Toehammer wouldn't accept whatever she was offering in trade, the true Scootie came out and she decided to just take them.<br>
<br>
As was already stated, we were fighting a multiple mob pull when she decided to just sit and camp. She had the loot she wanted in her hands and decided to take it dishonestly, with no regard for her reputation or the possibility of deaths in her group, due to her leaving. Those gauntlets better give her the ability to solo effectively, because one thing is for sure. You need friends, or at least people who respect your abilities and know they can trust you, to succeed in this game.<br>
I now know she can't be trusted and I definitely don't respect her or her abilities.<br>
 <br>
Good luck to you Scootie, as word spreads I'm sure you'll find very few opportunities to use those gauntlets you had to have so bad. The best part of it is.....you have nobody to blame but yourself.<br>

The last time I grouped with her in Cappy, she was looting every kill before it had even hit the ground.  Most of our group never got a chance to loot a thing.  It wasn't until many of us started to continiously point out that letting someone else loot once in a while would considerate especially since our  cleric and enchanter were medding for upcoming pulls.  I also mentioned to several people in the group that it wouldn't suprise me to see her ninja loot the gaunts or some other rare drop from the cappy should he drop something other than the Uber mantle.   Contrary to what was said she is not a druid, she is a warrior and  a horrible one at that. Either she doesn't know what taunt is or she wasn't taunting because she was 95% plus health the entire time we were there.  I am sorry for those that were in cappy when the gaunts dropped it sucks to see them go to someone as selfish as this.  I have been in Karnors for 7 levels and have to say this is one of the worst things I have witnessed there in quite a while.  Needless to say I will never group with her again.  Enjoy your gaunts Scootie, I hope they bring you happiness in your upcoming solo warrior career.<br>

Ive experienced all scooties shit in a group before. At one point she said that she had to go AFK for about 45 mins and wondered if she could stay in group. We of course told her no. She then asked if she could take her spot back as soon as she got back. We said sure what the hell, not really caring. <br>
<br>
So she disbands and leaves. Next pull: Warlord. The drop? Cobalt gaunts. And not a warrior in group to have them.<br>
<br>
Sweet justice I say. When she came back we all made sure we flaunted the fact<br>

Was working the Hand room about 2 months ago with some guildies to get my Pawbuster pipe.  We had moved into zone, camp checked twice and then moved to hand.  Full pop, I split it and then we set up for Jail/Warlord.  Scootie comes running in with three others and proceeds to sit down in the Hand room and say &quot;we were here first, we just got trained out trying to break it so we are back now&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh, my tool alarm went off at this point.  I think we all know by now, if you can't break/hold a camp..it ain't yours.  And besides we called camp check twice.  This worthless POS hadn't even been in Hand, she just decided to head up with a couple of her buddies and see if she could gank the camp.  Needless to say we held it, and took all the kills with no problems, even the ones they tried to KS.  So what does she do..moves to jail/warlord and claims it.  Now that pissed me off cause I was really only there for pawbuster.<br>
<br>
Thankfully the tool-o-matic didnt come anywhere near being able to break warlord and she wound up training it out.  We then broke it and I did get my pawbuster that night =).<br>

Yea, she likes to loot before the mob can hit the ground, and yea, she isn't very good of a warrior... and yea, she's a tool.  BUT.... Wait.. there is no but........ She's just a E-baying, ninja looting little whore who thinks the point of the game is to get all the loot you can and not enjoy the damn game!!!! *coughbitchcough*<br>
<br>
Thankfully, nothing worthwhile dropped in our handroom group, and we got down to a &quot;Master Looting&quot; plan, but since then, I haven't stayed in a group with her for very long <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/30/01 8:56:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Woohoo</span><hr size=1> Whoa, I'm not alone!  Fortunately, she never ninja'd anything worthwhile when I grouped with her, however she most definately hits every corpse as soon as she can.  I've verbally bitch slapped her more than once in a group about that, of course, it never works for long.  The other thing I encountered with her is that she is constantly pulling, pulling, pulling, never checking for mana .. always looking for that one certain mob (most likely to ninja).  I think in one night, I saw her start 5 different groups within oh, an hour or so.  She would form a group in KC, and then just keep group hopping til she got to cappy.  What a nitwit.<br>
<br>
I hope she doesn't plan to go to the Planes any time soon.  Such a shame that she needs to go there for her epic too.  She won't be attending any raids that Sagemon and I run, that's for sure.  I'm fairly certain she's blacklisted on a few other pick up raid leaders lists.  If she's not, she will be soon. <p>Tormentcia

Seems she decided to master loot, then after 2 hours not only didn't random the 3 spell drops (one of which a wizard in the group actually needed) but didn't even bother to reimburse the cleric, hanabul, for stones.  Can you believe that crap?<br>
