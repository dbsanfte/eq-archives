The only reason I post is because my first guild was very much a casual players guild. These kinds of guilds are fine even for a hardcore player, but only for a time. The second guild I was in was a little less of a casual players guild, but all the same was more a social club, then an organized attempt to grow and become raid capable.<br>
<br>
Most of my personal small camps done to achieve my epic were done while a member of True Allegiance. TA is a wonderful place with many great people. Two of my alts are still members. Many people in that guild helped me to get to where I am now. Do they begrudge me leaving TA because I had goals to achieve with my main that I could not with them?<br>
<br>
I honestly can not answer that. What I do know is that many of the higher level characters in that guild have moved on for the same reasons I felt I needed to. Many of which came to A Twist of Fate shortly after I did.<br>
<br>
If I was to never be able to go to the places that I aspire to go visit and raid, I would not find much challenge and fun in this game. If I find myself in a place where my present guild can't or won't grow to become capable of some of the things other guilds are. Then I may be faced with another decision.<br>
<br>
I am however sure that my present guild would not begrudge me leaving, if I choose to do so. within two weeks of joining they had made it possible to gain my epic. I have in return as well help in others journey to achieve epics. I would not have that epic were it not for thier generosity and commitment to help. My achievement being less so of an achievement as a gift from my present guild.<br>
<br>
People join guilds for many reasons, Why get worked up over someone elses choices. I can only suggest you pick up where you left off, and move on.<br>
<br>
Or as my grandfather used to tell me, " get up kid, rub some dirt in it and walk it off, you'll be fine."<br>

That's fine, it's what the game is about. Killing higher level things, moving to harder zones.  What really fucking gets me, is that many members of MC have gotten their epic, and a month later are seen in some new and improved guild. These people aren't just leaving because they're tired of being level 60 and waiting for people to catch up. Most of the people that have left weren't level 60 at all; most of them, though, had their epic, and most left within a month of getting it.<br>
<br>
I too, am getting really fucking pissed off at people using MC and other not-so-uber guilds as stepping stones, and then saying &quot;so long and thanks for all the fish&quot; and /guildremoving. If it were just a select few that had done this, it would be fine, I'm sure lots of guilds experience this, but it's the same thing over and over and over again.  <br>
<br>
Other guilds have been openly recruiting from MC, and whilest I haven't been a target myself (must be because I'm a paladin....), I've had guildies telling me that someone from (insert guildname here) sent them a tell asking if they'd like to join.<br>
 <br>
It's just bullshit.<br>
Utter, utter bullshit.<br>

FUCK  YOU!</span><hr size=1> Ok... I didn't read much beyond the first post, so if the subject has changed entirely by now, sorry.  But I don't understand the mentality of people who get pissed about high level players who leave their guilds for new ones.  &quot;You owe us!  We helped you get &lt;insert Shiny Toy here&gt;!!!&quot;  It's a GAME.  And if you've managed to get to the level you have without noticing this, let me clue you in on something.  People play it for different reasons.  Why the hell should a person stay in a guild when they think they'd have more fun in another one, simply out of guilt?  <br>
<br>
Game.  Understand?  G-A-M-E.  Last I heard, people played games for their amusement.  If you're the type of player that wants to be in the highest level stuff and have the best gear, you join a high level guild.  Why exactly should a person like that feel compelled to stay in the guild they started in?  When you started playing, was it for exactly the same reasons you continued?  Did you know right away what style of playing you were best suited for?   All three of you that just raised your hands, you need deoderant.  For the rest of us that learned by experience what we wanted out of the game, we occasionally did things that didn't meet that goal.  We started with warriors before realizing bards were our favorite class.  We began as elves before we realized that for some demented reason, we preferred halflings.  Or we joined guilds that we thought had the same goals as us, but then we changed our minds and joined guilds with different goals.  And yeah, maybe our starting guilds helped us with getting stuff.  That's what guilds do.  We helped them as well.  That's usually the way it works, and a person should not have to feel compelled to remain in a guild he/she has outgrown simply because of whiny little gimps getting pissed because they once helped you with a fight in our epic quest.<br>
<br>
By the same token, why the hell our you pissed at the uber guilds &quot;targeting&quot; high level players with good playing skills that are in smaller guilds.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You used the word &quot;poaching.&quot;  Whatever you're smoking, can I have some?!  Poaching?!  You're not talking about some animal who's being hunted and can't defend himself.  The people playing are adults that have the right to decide what they want out of the game.  Poaching.  Get a fucking clue.  Coming to a person with an offer isn't exactly the same as what you're describing, which is more along the lines of having your children stalked by some psycho.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line is, people play the game for their own reasons.  Look at someone in one of the uber-guilds... Koryo, to pull a person out of my head who is about the only member of Magister whose name I can remember... If he started in a small guild, do you think he should have stayed there to lend his skills to his guild... for his entire everquest career?  (no idea where Koryo started, btw... just picked a name.)  He's leading a really powerful guild, which likely means he's a skilled player who should be leading ToV raids if that's what he wants to do, not twinking struggling level 20s in whatever guild he started at that hasn't really spawned any other high level players.  Play the game for your reasons, get the fuck off the cross and your moral high horse, and accept that other people play for other reasons.  Not everyone thinks like you.  Thank God.<br>

<br>
1) it not about internal struggles<br>
<br>
2) it not about greener pastures<br>
<br>
it about people who want to join a guild cause some of their friend join it,yet in the guild they wanna join they cannot get their epics til 58+.So for this reason,they join a guild who is capable of getting them their epic before that minimum requirement,then they move on once it is gotten.<br>
<br>
In this aspect,they are the worst people in game,someone left recently who got his epic a week before,Now why would someone do that,and go to the said guild?.Greeener pastures? not liking someone all of a sudden?,no,they used MC to get what they would not get in the guild they wanted to go to.<br>
<br>
These same people,not just the single person i mentioned above,say they stuff like &quot;god i cannot believe that person got his epic and left&quot; or &quot;i would never do that&quot; about getting their epics,then once they get them,they go &quot;well,i like you and all,but i don't like how it is run,or how that person treated me&quot; about something that happened a week,month before they got their epic.<br>
<br>
So i post this,for all you fucking assholes that left MC once you got your epic,DO NOT ever ask me for help on anything,and i will never ask you for anything in return.And to the people who actively recruit(they send tells,and talk to the person,trying to get them to come over) i say your a fucking asshole also,your scum,and what i said above goes for you also.<br>

If they are my friends I wanted them to play with me.  Like it or not, at the high end game, you will be spending most if not all of your time with your guild mates.   It makes it that much nicer when those same people are your long time friends.<br>

I was just picking an example of the first high level, skilled player I could think of that was in a powerful guild.  <br>
<br>
I'm not getting what he's saying?  Actually, I think I understand what he's saying just fine; I just don't agree.  Yeah, I can see where people would be irritated if a person got their epic and immediately left a guild.  But his post seems to be aimed at anyone who reaches a high level and leaves a guild for another one, or any high level guilds that recognize the playing skills of someone in another guild and ask them to join.  What the heck is wrong with extending an invitation?!  It's not like the player is the property of one guild or another; they're adults with decision-making abilities!  <br>
<br>
And then he says that those guilds have no reason to be proud of themselves, because they recruited people that were already high, as opposed to growing them themselves.  Um, not everyone who starts the game and joins a young guild is capable of the playing skills needed to take on some of the higher end stuff.   It would be pretty unlikely for any guild that got together as newbies to grow to one of the most powerful guilds on the server with the exact same founding members as it started and without adding any more.  The powerful guilds have the right to be proud of themselves, whether they recruited higher level players or not.  From what I can understand, it's their ACCOMPLISHMENTS that win them respect, not how they got their members.  If someone manages to kill AoW on this server, should they be any less proud of themselves because their players were recruited once they had proven their playing skill in high level battles, as opposed to taking a chance on a level 10 with a good personality?<br>
<br>
All I'm saying is, you're judging people for not thinking like you.  Yeah, there are people out there that use guilds as stepping stones for better guilds.  But from what I've seen, just about any time a high level player leaves a low level guild, he gets flamed for it.  I remember getting tells from members of Abneo's old guild when he left and helped form Lummox.  They were pissed because he had his epic.  Never mind that he had spent a LOT of time in his EQ life helping his guild out, never mind that they actually only helped him on a couple of the battles, never mind that it was about a month after he got his epic that he found himself getting restless again and wanting a change of scenery; he was flamed simply for leaving the guild, and they used the epic as an excuse to vent their anger.  It was pathetic.  And I'm betting that quite a few of the people that left the original posters guild and got his panties in a twist, have helped their guild out their fair share as well.  Are there assholes who just use a guild to get what they want?  Yeah, but I think the majority of people who leave guilds just want something new., more suited to their style of playing.  And it's their fucking game, their entertainment.   They've got every right to enjoy it.  I think it's sad to even be angry at them; but being pissed at the guilds who recruit them is just pathetic.<br>

I am a proud FOUNDING member of the Inner Circle of Norrath. For a short time I was it's guildmaster and from the tells I recieved from my friends in game, I did a good job. <br>
    We did all kinds of things together. We started a guild fund for gems and spells. We did weekly raids at the level we were capable of doing with our membership. We hunted and exped together as much as we could.<br>
    The Inner Circle prides itself as being a family guild. By that i mean, we do the best we can to be a family. Take care of one another. It sounds to me like that is one of the things that the original poster is talking about.<br>
    For a short time I left the ICoN to join Stone Guard because a friend of mine had been asking me for a while to join him.<br>
    I never thought about actually leaving before but I am in the Air Force and I was getting ready to leave the area to go to war. So, one night he brought it up and I decided to put the idea before my members because for about 3 to 6 months I anticipated not being able to be there for the guild. The minimum requirement for SG was 49 and every member that I had that was of level went.<br>
    Some or all of the members that were left behind were upset dased and confused, understandably so. All of the members who went over though, like has been brought up routinely in this thread, wanted to be able to do things in the game that we couldnt have done had they stayed in the ICoN.<br>
    The folks that I considered friends and family were happy that we could go somewhere to be able to do what we wanted. They also simply looked forward to moving to SG with us.<br>
    Recently though I returned from the war. A week or two after I got back, the leader of SG wasnt going to be able to be online enough to take care of his members. So he worked it out to where his members that were 54+ could join RoD. Wich of course left me and some of my friends out in the cold because we were only around 48 to 51 at the time and couldnt go.<br>
    You know what, I realized a few things that my friend Cryptonite had been telling me for a long time. ( He was the one who kept asking me to go to SG.) Guilds come and go, it's just the way EQ is. Don't get too bent out of shape about it. Just try and end up in a good guild or start one and run it the way you wanna be guilded he always and still tells me.<br>
    On that note let me tell you all something about how I view a family in comparison to being a guild. Ten people start a guild because they have become friends or because they have similar ideas about how to play the game or whatever. These ten folks would I assume all be officers since they are founding members. ( Thats how it was for the ICoN)<br>
    Officers are the &quot;parents&quot; who give the guild direction and focus. The members are the officers &quot;children&quot;. They hope to join a guild and have direction and focus because they wanna succeed. In whatever field they find important to them. Of course meaning friendship or gear.<br>
    &quot;Children&quot; grow up. Some stay close to home because they are very attached to mom and dad. Some move as far away from home as they can. Not because they don't love mom and dad but maybe because they only wanna have you come visit once in a while. Either way, friends are friends. Whether they wear the ICoN guild tag or not, MY FRIENDS are my family. Not just my guild members.<br>
    Earlier tonight, Crypto and I were talking on the phone. He really wants to be able to do certain things with his SK, Cleric and Mage that are all 53+. He CAN'T do any of that with the ICoN. I love my guild to death but our resorces are limited due to the fact that we are rebuilding.<br>
    I am real life friends with Hippocrates, the Leader of the Legion of Fate. THEY can help Crypto do what he wants SO, being his friend I asked Hippo if the LoF could use a REALLY talented player like Crypto. Hippo wasn't just going to take him on my word, not because he doesnt trust me but when it comes to certain things I realise that Hippo is all buisness. The LoF didnt get to where it is by being slouches. <br>
    Out of friendship though he had Crypto send a tell to some of his officers, and Crypto got on his own merits. Guess what I had lost a valuable player to my guild. Guess what else I was HAPPY for him. You know why? Cause I ROCK as a friend. He is gonna get to do what he wants and I am stoked. <br>
    Beyond friendship, Loyalty and all of that, This is a freakn GAME, if someone doesnt have the same gameing requirements you do and decides to move to a guild that meets their needs. More power to ya I say. After all it's their coin and I don't mean Plat, being spent making their characters. So if they decide that they want to get what they want with another guild all you can do is decide if you still wanna be their friend and start looking for more members.<br>

    P.S. How many players do you think there are in this game not guilded somewhere after level 20.

Good, you are now making progress. Now read the following:<br>

Being the first person to hit level 60 on an EQ server, or being one who is in an "uber guild" is not something you can put on your job resume, isn't it? Right.<br>
<br>
Don't be so damn proud about uber guilds or whether or not you were the first to buy a fucking horse IG. It makes no REAL difference.<br>

2) No officer of RoD approached Cleptor , I did<br>
3) Why? because he was unhappy..he's my friend..and if your not having fun playing why play<br>
4) If you had the people in guild to do it you'd zerg mobs also , so don't see where this means anything<br>

FUCK  YOU!</span><hr size=1> Dwarks right it has nothing to do with ..UI or magister or SF. <br>
<br>
Fact is one particular guild .. hit us so hard and it looked like at the time a real attempt to destroy  MC. <br>
<br>
And it nearly worked  when you loose 3 or 4 level 60s to one guild in 3 days  of whom had just completed epics you start to wonder. <br>
<br>
Then ....a few of your guildmates  who i mite add  not long hit 59 - 60  and part there of or complete epic tell you that got a /tell invite to guild X.  and look round as see 8 or 9 ex members in that guild, it dosent take much to add 2 and 2 .<br>
<br>
Fact is its been indicated that were are a low level guild .. well you may wanna look our minimum to join is 54 it was started as high level guild, then when the ppl that have been with since 52 or so get to 58 - 59 - 60 ..and go cool we about ready to hit  places like Tov etc.<br>
<br>
That didnt happen  for various reasons the above mentioned the main one. <br>
<br>
I confronted one of their officers nothing happened. <br>
Talked to their GM ... got an even better ignorant response. <br>
<br>
If i was a 12 years old it proberbly  wouldnt bother me ...but I'm not. And it dose piss me off. <br>
<br>
But then i quote a member... &quot; I raised my kids at home ... why should I have to do it in EQ? &quot; <br>
<br>
Dealing with kiddies .. what do you expect?<br>
