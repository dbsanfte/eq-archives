Rome the Empire which I will  greatly simplify as conservative for our purposes endured for 500+ years. Furthermore, I think that understanding the fall of Rome, and other &quot;Empires&quot; is critical for understanding how to keep the USA from crumbling along with them. Thanks you for elaborating on the fall of Rome, as it wasn't fresh in my mind (seriously). <br>
<br>
 Arikel, I believe that if you look at the current research of Social Psychology you may find that human intuition/reason is not as pronounced as you maintain. Sterotypes are everywhere...... we use them everyday in everyway. <br>
<br>
 Arikel said &quot;If we let sterotypes rule our thinking...our society would be less advanced as it is&quot;<br>
<br>
 Response: How can you maintain you know how people think, and use sterotypes, when you have done/ read little or no research on sterotypes? Your viewpoint must be based predominantly on intuition. Sterotypes may not rule our thinking as you say Arikel, but on some level they serve a purpose. Sterotypes are deeply ingrained in our minds. The concept of belief preservence which I eluded to earlier is defined as such:<br>
<br>
Belief preservance: Persistence of one's initial conception, as when the basis for one's belief is discredited but an explaination of why the belief might be true survives. <br>
<br>
 For example once we consider, why an accused person might be guilty, why an offending stranger acts a certain way, or why a favored stock might rise in value, our explainations might SURVIVE challenging evidence to the CONTRARY. (Davies, 1997; Jelalian &amp; Miller,1984). Keep in mind, one or two studies on a subject is not the defining word, but it beats intuition. <br>
<br>
 Arikel, in your first post you made a rather large sterotype of the poster, that he was dumb, uneducated, and not serious about the issue based on one post. You further went on to sterotype liberals as smarted, better educated, and more serious about &quot;real world&quot; issues then &quot;far Wing Reagan conservative&quot;, whatever the hell that is. <br>
<br>
 You are correct that my sterotypes about liberals have NO substancial real world basis to them. I think however that you are too hard on the Ronald Reagan's of the world,  they have their place, and that's why I proceeded to slam you liberals around abit<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
 In conclusion, I don't agree with the Al Gore's(far left), or the Rush Limbaugh's (Far right) of the world, however I do think they both have their purpose. As long as The USA has a ballance of the two I think we will be fine. Lastly, I think you just don't want to talk to me because I don't agree with you. -Mec<br>

Thousands of people who are so incredibly fearful of what our government *might* do to the sociopathic, fascist, misogynists who form the Taliban that they have felt it necessary to take the time to organize protests.<br>
<br>
Have any of these same people *ever* protested the horrendous human rights violations in Afghanistan?  I'd hope so, but I honestly wonder.<br>
<br>
The &quot;far-left&quot;, in my mind, is frequently about preserving one's own little ideal view of the world.  It is a luxury that the supposedly &quot;tyranical and imperialist&quot; US has completely afforded them.  It is a luxury that no one in Afghanistan outside of the Taliban can excersise without being executed.<br>
<br>
At the other end of the spectrum, the &quot;far-right&quot; is essentially the Taliban without beards.  These are the folks who would seriously support Muslim internment camps.<br>
<br>
All I can say is that we must hope that far saner voices than any found at either extreme prevail.  This conflict can find a resolution, but shots are going to be fired.  I truly believe that it is not the goal of our government to heap even more misery on the already suffering Afghani innocents.  Anyone who thinks it is, is quite probably too cynical for their own good.<br>
<br>
As far as our history in the region goes... Our actions in that region have been far more moderate than those of any of the nations that actually form it.<br>
<br>
Criticize the US all you want and take as biased a view as you want, but historical facts cannot be disputed.  Every US action in the Middle East can easily be countered with an equally brutal action initiated by one of the radical regimes.  No one's hands are free of blood in this and I, for one, am getting a little tired of hearing NOTHING but the anti-American story.<br>
<br>
Never forget that we, as Americans, are lightning quick to point out the failings and excesses of our government and foreign policy.  How many Iraqis, Libyans, Syrians or Iranians would turn the same introspective view on their OWN nations murderous histories?  Never forget that difference, because it is an important one.<br>
<br>
While we in the US grow increasingly divided in our opinion of what actions would be &quot;appropriate&quot; and increasingly critical of our own policies, the radical regimes grow more impassioned and more united in their blind hatred for our fundamental way of life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1614<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 11:21:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=201.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply</span><hr size=1> &quot;Your viewpoint must be based predominantly on intuition.&quot;<br>
<br>
Incorrect.  My viewpoint is based primarily on personal experience, what you might call research in the field.  I am able to act and think without being ruled by stereotypes.  So are many of my peers.  Thus, clearly human beings are capable of acting and thinking without being ruled by stereotypes.  Simple logic.  You are correct that everyone eventually uses stereotypes in their day to day life, conciously or otherwise.  That in no way disproves any of my statements, nor does it prove that relying on stereotypes is a desirable course of action.  Stereotyping has been the root of many horrible events in our history, not the least of which would be the WTC disaster (radical Muslims stereotyping Americans).  <br>
<br>
At no point did I state that liberals were more intelligent that conservatives, either.  I can understand how one would misconstrue my initial post; as I said, I was responding to a flame with a flame.  I wasn't being terribly clear, I was expressing anger.  I think my second post clarified my position nicely, yet you continue to make innacurate statements regarding my posts here.  You're right in that I did say intellectuals are more intelligent than non-intellectuals, and by and large I believe they are.  Everyone has some sort of talent, and people whose talents lie with the intellect, particularly abstract thinking, are generally termed intellectuals.  Did you know that there are conservative intellectuals out there too?  Break away from stereotypical thought and you will uncover all sorts of interesting facts you'd overlooked before.<br>
<br>
&quot;far Wing Reagan conservative&quot;<br>
<br>
WTF are you talking about here?  I never said that, nor did I use those words.  My only comment about Reagan was that the conservative Reagan administration helped to put Bin Laden in a position of power among his people.  That's a fact, it's not some sort of speculation or theory.  Please stop reconstructing my arguements, and _please_ stop attributing this horrible grammar to me.<br>
<br>
As for my reasons for not wanting to argue with you, I've got three of them.  One is your repeated misrepresentation of my arguements here.  I believe that you are doing this deliberately, so as to make it easier to defeat them.  That's a bullshit debate tactic, and I won't waste time with people who use it.  Second would be your attempt to use patriotic sentiments to lend weight to your arguement.  This discussion has nothing to do with feelings of patriotism, it is a discussion based on reason and fact.  I don't like it when people attempt to manipulate the emotions of others in order to sway their opinions.  Third, I remember your old &quot;Definition of intelligence&quot; thread.  I stopped posting to that early on because I saw that you were not interested in meaningful discussion, only in trying to verbally pwn people.  You had apparently closed your mind completely to opposing arguements, to the point that you essentially repeated yourself over and over as the thread progressed.  The entire board was begging you to shut the hell up, and they had pretty good reason.<br>
<br>
As for being too hard on the Ronald Reagans of the world... I'm too hard on gimps who spam this board with bullshit propaganda about how much liberals sux0r and conservatives r0x0r.  Periodically some tool crawls out of the woodwork and posts some lame political flame, oftentimes cut and pasted from another source entirely.  Then the rest of the gang comes along and starts posting &quot;Yeah, you're right!  Liberals are so stupid and we're all smarter than them!&quot;  It gets old being shit on over and over again with no provocation.  I don't remember a single political flame started by a liberal, other than the &quot;Who does George W. remind you of?&quot; thread, started by a guy from another server.  I'm kind of pissed about it.  Several people, conservatives included, have asked that everyone cut the partisan flaming in light of WTC.  I had thought people would do so.  This goon had to post something though, and it was the last straw for me.<br>
<br>
Incedentally, I'm perfectly willing to argue with reasonable people, even if they disagree with me.  Ask Triff, we had a rather long and completely civil debate on the &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; thread.  Neither of us came away convinced of the other's viewpoint, and unless Triff is secretly pissed at me I'd say there were no hard feelings either way.<br>
<br>
Goddamn, that was a long post.  Any more questions? <p>Arikel Callistrae <BR>

However, I think that when we're considering such radical action as a declaration of war, however justified it may be, we need more than ever to be relentlessly self-critical.  We're considering an action that _will_ cost innocent lives.  Sometimes bad things happen to good people, and I'm willing to regretfully accept that.  It doesn't change the fact that we need to be honest with ourselves about how this situation has come about.<br>
I don't think that most of the people often characterized as anti-American truly deserve that label.  Most folks discussing our previous conduct in the Middle East, good or bad, are just trying to make sense of the situation and understand the events that have led up to it.  It's true that we have sent aid to the region many, many times.  It's true that we've done our best to stop violence there and preserve human life.  It's also true that we've supported violent dicators and fanatics in order to maintain a political climate that some felt would be to our advantage.  We are not monsters, by any means.  Bin Laden is wrong in thinking this.  That doesn't make us angels though, and to refuse to accept this is arrogant.  I'm glad some folks are aware of the facts, and while I don't believe that a peaceful solution is possible I respect the opinions of those who do.  This is part of what makes our country a better one than Afghanistan.  Our diversity is our power, it is what divides us from single-minded fanatics like Bin Laden and his followers.<br>
Ironically enough, despite my generally liberal tendencies I have to say I'm impressed with the way the Bush administration has handled this.  They've learned from the millitary fuckups of Clinton and Bush Sr., and seem to genuinely want to do the right thing.  Props to them. <p>Arikel Callistrae <BR>
