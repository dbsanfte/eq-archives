LOL....Man u r so funny...The words u use....tsk tsk tsk...If there is a hell, then u just gained the first class seat pal =p But we all know that's not gonna happen. Why? Because there is no true hell. Hmm let's see if u were a pure sinner when u died, would u choose to go to a Catholic Hell, Methodist Hell or Protestant Hell? Your damn religion is in itself divided with their own so called 'true' definitions of Christianity. So tell me which is the 'true' teaching? U can't tell me cos u don't know. If a certain god  exists, then how come there are so many religions? he must be real multi-talented LOL.<br>

   In conclusion, god does not exist. He's just a fairytale, just like Harry Potter, just like Everquest. Oh and Brutos after u read this and if u get mad, go see the priest or pray lest u do somethin like rape yr pet cat to release tension or reply to this post and talk about my mom in childish anger =)<br>

If you don't believe in God then don't.  I don't care if you do or don't.  But if life is nothing but some kind of coincidence to you then mabye your mother is just some kind of animal( a dog mabye) that got knocked up by some other animal( another dog perhaps) and when you die, worms will eat your rotting corpse.  Isn't that what you believe in Xamael??  Life is nothing but coincidental existance to you.  So who cares about your slut mother?  She is nothing but an animal right Xamael?? She will die and turn into a rotting heap of dried blood, magget ridden meat.  Thats right isn't it Xamael?  And thats what life is about??  I'm not angry with you.  I just think you are a coward who can't handle life and so you crawl into your little cave and pretend there is nothing to figure out about life.  There is no God and nothing after death.  Thats the easy way out, and thats what makes you a coward;  someone who gives up.  You are a quitter and so is your slut mother...   But don't be angry Xamael.  Your mother is only a animal who exists coincidentally with the ability of conscience.  So no reason to be insulted by me calling your mother a cocksucking anal ass fuking whore is there?

Your atheist also right?  We are still animals and Bound by nature.  We will reproduce like animals and die liek them too.  If you and other guy there are really athiests like you say;  then why would you even feel the need to respond to the &quot;Do you believe in God&quot; post????( A real athiest wouldn't respond to somehting that doesn't matter)   Its because you aren't atheist.  In fact, I think it is Extremely rare that anyone be an atheist(i mean like 1 in a million).  Atheist to me is somoene with some serious issues(not that people who say they believe in God don't have issues either)  Atheism is a response to a complicated situation(one might say the same for believing in God as well)  It's a developed thought pattern which protects, defends and/or shelters one against feelings of confusion,frustration, hopelessness and helplessness(again, one might say the same for believing in God as well).  It's difficult for me to be objective because of my strong faith in God. but if anything I would say I rather believe in something than nothing.  Soemthing matters; whatever it may be, but nothing doesn't matter.  'Nothing' is actually something, but it is something that has no real function or consequence, hence the idea of that other guys mom dying and it meaning nothing.  Or also when I called his mother a slut whore cocksucking bitch and compared her to a dog and in turn exclaimed &quot;that it didn't matter cause there is no God anyway&quot;.  BUT, that guy DID respond to my calling his mother those slanderous things; WHICH PROVES that he is NOT and atheist either. &lt;-----BECAUSE, a true atheist would not even respond to such garbage.(garbage meaning irrelevence)             Question for you Triff:  If you had all the answers, would you feel interested or curious anymore??  No I dont' think so &lt;--------REASON and logic which supports FAITH based belief.  FAITH being a union of heart and mind or Thought and Feeling. &lt;-------The same thing that makes the workd go 'round;  Order and Chaos.(chaos not in a bad sense, but being synonomous with change)  You, Triff are fooled by todays 'scientific-based thought'  its ok because most people are.  But science based thought is no better than any other fundamental which has been used in the evolution of humanity.  Just like Crawling when you are a baby might seem like it is inferior to walking but actually it is Crucial is the developement in a childs motor planning, which is used for mental growth as well.  Science does NOT contain all the answers nor will it ever.  God is not 'something' you can put in a box or sum up in a few words or feelings.  Thats what makes life beautiful.

<br>
Reason and logic do not support faith (and you failed to even support that statement, you used some circular logic there). Faith is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a union of thought and emotion: it is the subordination of thought to your emotions. Faith in no way supports thought. The very definition of faith is belief <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> without logical proof</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. It shouldn't need to be said, but it requires no thought to not think.<br>
<br>
Science is the study of reality. Scientific thought is proving things to yourself before believing them. &quot;God&quot; certainly is not something you can define, and no, I don't think life is made beautiful by your belief in some entity that can't be defined.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Stop loooking for science and other logic based ideas to shape the world you live in. Feel a little. You know, 'feel', the Other half of who you are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I don't share your sort of mind-body dichotomy. Humans see, think, and begin to recognize values. Emotions are then based on those values. There is no separation. You are telling me to simply follow my emotions instead of thinking about things.<br>

<br>
Just so you know (and yes I do believe in God and I do read the bible so flame me for it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  neither the bible, not God, ever say you should just feel and follow your emotions.  You defined fatih as belief without logical proof... and later (in response to Brut222) implied that only those who do not think for themselves would have faith.  Is that correct?  <br>
<br>
I have been taught something entirely different about faith.  Faith in God doesn't mean you rely on your emotions and withdrawl your brain from use.  I shall give you a definition here: taken from the Parson's Bible Dictionary<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Faith is in general the persuasion of the mind that a certain statement is true (Phil. 1:27; 2 Thess. 2:13). Its primary idea is trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. It admits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance with the evidence on which it rests.<br>
Faith is the result of teaching (Rom. 10:14-17). Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith (John 10:38; 1 John 2:3)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As you can see, what I have been taught regarding faith is quite different from what you stated above.  Basically, I believe faith = trust.  <br>
<br>
I trust God and believe His word to be true.  I believe Jesus died for my sins = I trust in Him that He has redeemed me.  That's my belief and I operate from that standpoint.  Many people I know did not arrive at the decision to believe in God based upon simple emotions.  Instead, as in all things in their lives, they came to the decision after careful consideration and research.  I mean come on, there are some hard questions that we all have... like Why does God allow evil to exist?  If He is all powerful, why doesn't he just eradicate it?  Why did he allow it in the first place?  Anyone who blindly follows and never questions would not be human.  I jsut believe that the answers provided to me are true.  I trust them, I trust God.  I have faith.  But I do assure you, my brain did not turn off simply because someone said &quot;This is So!&quot;  I think about it, and come to my own conclusions.  <br>
<br>
Think of it this way...  suppose you met a person who acted completely mad on teh street, accompanied by your Mother (whom you trust).  Lets say she says this person is jsut pretending to behave this way for an experiment.  You have faith that your mother is telling you the truth and therefore, even though this person's actions are really weird, you decide to trust her and accompany her.  After a couple hours you all go home and you see this person indeed, take off theri odd actions and become &quot;normal.&quot;  You trusted your Mother, you had faith, but you still questioned, yes?  Did your brain stop working?  No.  You might have even reconsidered following your Mom and this weirdo around all day, but you believed your Mother to be right, and so trusted her.<br>
<br>
What I have been taught is somewhat the same.  So, this may offer you a different viewpoint to consider.  Although I believe in God, I am not representative of all people who believe, so they probably have differning attitudes (see Brut222) regarding this post, but hey, I was reading all this and thought I'd throw a bit more into the mix.<br>
<br>
Btw, if my first paragraph regarding your faith statement wasn't true, then I jsut typed all this for nothing didn't I?  Darnit!!!!<br>

Your dictionary has a nice reversal of the law of cause and effect there.

Jesus once said: &quot;Through me all things were made; without me nothing was made that has been made. In me was life, and that life was the light of men...Through me all things were created, and by me all things shall be held together.&quot; (john 1:14 I believe..)<br>

<br>
I was telling you that there are other alternatives out there than what you believe.  I think anyone that asked you to overhaul your whole life without seriously thinking about it and investigating it would be denying that very human aspect we all have - doubt.  Just because I believe doesn't mean I never doubt, it doesn't mean I don't question.  <br>
<br>
I'm not here to convince you that your style of life is wrong or that what you believe is wrong as compared to me.  However, simply because someone has faith in God doesn't mean that they required no proof.  Really, there is no way to either prove nor disprove scientifically the existence of God.  God exists outside science.  In the end, you end up deciding based upon the evidence you can evaluate.  <br>
<br>
Well, with all the evidence I have seen, I chose to believe.  It takes an extra step either way.  To believe or to reject.. its a decision.  Btw, accepting Christ doesn't mean overhauling your life, though there should certainly be changes as you grow with God.  God accepts you just as you are.  <br>
<br>
Oh and I checked my Websters (Websters New World Dictionary, 2nd College Edition, printed 1986, page 503) :<br>
faith: 1) unquestioning belief that doesn't require proof or evidence.<br>
<br>
This definition says faith doesn't require proof or evidence, not that none exists.  Of course it also says unquestioning, and I bet that a lot of people who believe in God have doubts at times.  Including me for awhile. <br>
<br>
/shrug.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this was all to offer you another viewpoint, but I think you missed it.  It was from a bible dictionary, citing bible verses.  My point was that the bible doesn't teach blind faith based on emotions.  <br>

Question Triff: Are feelings equal to thought?<br>

Which is more important Triff? or are they equally important?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->What I stated before is that emotions (feelings) stem from what your values are. Your values are formed either by what you have thought out yourself, or—if you have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> done that—based on whatever your subconscious has deemed is good or bad as you go through life (this would be closer to &quot;your feelings&quot; actually). This being so, what you (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> truly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) think/believe will govern what you feel, and so I consider thought more important.<br>
<br>
Love is a strong happy feeling you get towards someone or something that follows your values (i.e. you value him/her/it a lot). It is not causeless, not a feeling that just magically appears out of nowhere. Trying to know and understand the truth is the only way you can logically form your own values.<br>
<br>
I don't consider love as such to be a virtue, but I do consider the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ability</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to truly love as one. And I think that to truly/fully love something, you must first understand your values and work out all contradictions there may be in your thinking. I think that Reason is the most important tool of any human being.<br>

And if you think it is straight proof that there's a god, then what is the existence of a god proof of? The god's god? Et cetera.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Dunkk:<br>

<br>
First: I think you are taking that quote and twisting its meaning to be a reference to nuclei (you think he was talking to people about atoms in the 1st century?). There is no evidence to support that—it's pretty similar to the people telling you to type in NYC in wingdings and heralding it as a link to terrorism.<br>
<br>
Second: Even supposing he did mean that, where is your proof that there was no one who had understood atomic science back then? There are any number of possibilities (from hidden civilizations to alien intervention) to lead to that; but even if none of those happened and somehow he still said it with that meaning in mind—it is not proof.<br>
<br>
Third: Where is your proof that there was a divine Jesus who ever said anything like that in the first place? All you have to cite for evidence is your Bible and some historical evidence that some man named Jesus probably did exist sometime around Year 0, around that relevent location.<br>
<br>
I don't see proof positive here.<br>

My turn for a question now. If the three of you have found your own different reasons to believe in your god, why is it the Christian god in particular? How is that more viable than the other religions out there? <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=50436"><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triff01.jpg" alt="Click for my EQCastersrealm profile" align="left" border=0></a><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/duel.gif" alt="rofl..

Ok your question was &quot;why is it that I choose christianity&quot;.  Several reasons.  1. I was born into a predominately Christian society.  As I got older I grew spiritually(not sure why, but I have taken a test which determines what type of learner you are and I tested as one who learns based on values.  Extra info-there are 4 different basic types of learners &lt;---fact    so I'm sure that involves, what I think, is a strong understanding of ethics/morals/psychology/sociology/human science type shit if you will)  so number 2. My learning style probably makes it easier for me to quickly understand this kind of shit.(just like your learning style probably allows you to more quickly understand the hard sciences) (about my learning style; There is a secondary strength which helps make for a good combo but I don't want to get into that too much)unless you want to.<br>
3.  Ok, back to when I when I grew up.  To put it very simple, I developed the same moral and ethical base as the new testament(Jesus).  I didn't realize it and even question the existence of Jesus until I was around 20 years of age.  Then some of the things that pissed me off about Christianity I found was false (I was taking a New testament class).  I had a very strong feeling form that point on that Jesus kicks ass and I love him for how he loves me.  So, in short, I developed the same Christian values with not going to church or having any peps in my family that influenced my idea of God.  There is much more to it but in short that is why.  And Triff, if you want answers from God all you have to do(and this is always true except when it is not necasarry to know, unless you keep insisting on knowing)  Ask God for the knowledge.  No matter what it is Triff.  Knowledge( I'm trying to think or imagine an example for this but I can not find a scenario where by you won't get an answer except for somehting like&quot;God tell me how it feels to be your ass&quot;  this is not necassary and will not be answered UNLESS you develop a strong feeling for this THEN you will know somehow someway.  I personally have asked many many questions and don't always do it 'cause I have noticed how powerful knowledge is, and how I can't handle it(knowledge meaning to feel some experience without going through the crap that gets you there).  This kind of stuff I have only explained to a couple very close people in my life.  This gets much more complicated.  DON'T take this to 100% literally 'cause I am not the perfect speaker or writer.  Tell me Triff, what would you like to know of God?  Plz tell me.  I will not attempt to answer your question but I am sure you will get the answer.  I am confident in this.  I don't normally express my 'very personal' relationship with God.  Plz respect that for me.  <br>
Flame the hell out of numbers 1 and 2, but plz don't flame 3.  Ask whatever you want, just plz no flamage.  I am not claiming to be somehitng special or have some kind of Godly knowledge.  I am only saying that you can know, understand and feel the answers for yourself. God, please give me the knowledge to understand why, what etc............... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utriff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Triff</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triffdot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 509<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/30/01 5:26:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=323>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to the Last Three Posts</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I was born into a predominately Christian society.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Listing that as a reason is not very um.. devout, I guess, of you. *shrugs*<br>

When I was younger I prayed a lot and read the happy little bible stories and things, and nothing ever happened, beyond me as a kid praying for snow days (during winter, mind you) and sometimes getting them, lol. I started losing interest in it (and morality as a whole) after a while because it never made a whole lot of sense to me, but never actually questioning whether Christian values really are right. Then I met my current girlfriend, who had me read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. It took me three months to finish the book, and it changed the way I think, for the better. And then I read all of her other books, and am currently about to finish Atlas Shrugged for the second time. Ayn Rand, 50 years ago, thought through all the ethics and actions of societies, and was able to compile them into a unifying philosophy called Objectivism, a philosophy based on objective reality. And I found that I totally agree with what she wrote about people.<br>
<br>
Now, about asking things of a god. I've closed my eyes and asked &quot;Do you exist?&quot; on occasion. Nothing. That's all I'd really want to know from a god.

<br>
Brutas,  In the act of asking one has to assent to the idea they are talking to something real... to something that can hear the question. But, if Triff doesn't know there is a god (i.e., he has no reasonable justification to believe and there is in fact a god) then he can't sincerely ask god for knowledge. It would be like me, a non-believer in Santa Claus, popping a letter in the mail addressed to Santa in the North Pole. Why would I even consider it? I would have to have some reasonable justification for sitting down to write the letter from the start! Likewise, the act of asking god requires that I have justification to believe that my request will be heard. <b>In other words, in order to ask I must already believe.</b> <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Thats why I tried to express that everyone has their own way of communiaction whether that be listening or speaking(or writing).  I just expressed an idea.  Kinda like saying&quot; I know you have tried coffee before and it really didn't do anything for you but I really thiink you will like this Hazelnut flavor)  I AM NOT boasting a certain religion/idea   Like I said before and I'll say it again, It does NOT matter (in my opinion) if you 'believe in the existence of God.  We will all know when the time comes(for each person, whenever that may be)  Doesn't matter   doesn't matter  doesn't matter    believe what you want to.  I don't believe God loves me better than Triff or any other 'atheist'  or, like i said earleir,  even the worst person who ever lived.  Let me ask you guys a question;  think of the person you love,  now think to yourselves, what is more important, &quot;my recognition of the physicall existence of that person OR the realtionship I have with them??  I would never ask you if you believed in this friend of yours.  SOUNDS obvious to you but I bet some peps could scientifically PROVE that what you are seeing in that 'person' you love soo much is a delusion or a form of symbolic logic created by your brain.  THAT same person could tell you, &quot;hey man, you and everyone else are nothing but a big bag of chemicals.  Nothing in your life is real, not even the love you have for your mother, father, sidter, brother, friend, dog, cat or whatever&quot;  IT CAN BE PROVEN SCIENTIFICALLY.  <br>
<br>
     So anyway I was telling Triff (in a very round about way, of which I did not want to throw all this info at him at once-with regards to possibly thrashing the info/idea (what the hell ever) I gave/suggested to him.  IN A NUTSHELL.  Faith is a tool.  A compass.  ( AND TRIFF--when you ahve kids you will know/feel when they are about to get into shit, TRUST ME)  FAITH allows me to explore the realm of my spirituality in new areas.  IT is not the only reason I believe in God.  It IS(not sure for every person in the world but it is for me) necassary as a foundation for creating a relationship with God  (JUST LIKE it is for your friends/parents/siblings--very similar)  The answer to all this and most everyhting in the world is not so black and white, and easy to explain.  ANOTHER 'thing' that has improved my relationship with God is 'asking for the knowledge'.  I DON&quot;T know and don't claim to know if realtionship with God is same for all peps.  In fact I think it is prob very different. Kinda like how I prefer to speak to different peps differently.  (Peps have different lines of communication)  This 'asking for the knowledge stuff' is a real part of my relationhip wth God(Just as giving a hug or smiling or loving someone close to you was and is.  Same thing.  Its just a relationship.  Call it real or not.  If its not then I need to market this drug cause its some good shit.

That's just a different group of people who denounce Christianity and then preach the exact same philosophy only without citing the Bible and instead acting like science supports them (and also usually putting the word &quot;society&quot; in place of &quot;God&quot; when telling you who to serve and sacrifice to).<br>

Brutas, faith isn't a foundation for relationships with people. There's really not much more I have to say on that subject, beyond saying that if you come up with an example where you'd say I'm having faith in another person, I will tell you, &quot;In that case I choose not to have faith, and instead judge the results by probability.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
