Everybody has troubles. Use the game to get away from those problems. Misery loves company, right? How about asking someone to talk to you about your problems. I'm sure you will find somebody out there who can relate. I've seen people hang out in EC tunnel all day and not do a damn thing but talk. Group up with them somewhere and have a chat. No reason to rain on other people's parade, accident or no.<br>
<br>
You mentioned that you are quite active with your church. What better place to find help coping? What do you get out of church anyway besides a grumbling complaint about what you must put up with? I realize you may not have time for it, but try taking a step back and take a deep breath. It might help you find what you are looking for. Good luck!<br>

Elmfall is my bro - and I was actually pulling for my guild that day - when I went LD and lost connectivity (due to power outage) for sometime.<br>
<br>
I get a phone call from my brother telling me what happened and it sickened me.  Perhaps my expectation was too high in thinking if it was a slaghter at least Radic could have offered to ITU as a Pally and drag bodies to the zone at a bare minimum, but he didn't offer that service (and my bro probably wouldn't have taken it - but an apology on the spot and an offer for help woulda helped the healing)<br>
<br>
On another note - thanks Radic for apologizing in the thread.  It seems like you are trying for a strong sympathy play, and I feel for you going through puberty and all the messes of life - but as many other threads state - we have all had our pain and confussion - and it is not an excuse.<br>
<br>
Maybe you could try in game to turn your pain into honorable acts.  In the end it is _CHOICES_ you make at the time that affect your reputation - and MORE important than your rep - other people's investment (their time in their characters).<br>
<br>
One last plug - I want to thank CEEB that day as he has taken care of my guild.  The gods have rewarded his kindness with lets see - a belt from fear - and arms, legs, bp, and shield from hate (all pcs in hate were one night on our guilds raid).<br>
<br>
Remember Radic - _Choose_!!! <p><center>

Radic, you just admitted to stealing the wurmslayer.  Cam gives you tells, you ignore.  I give you tells, you ignore.  You've had the Wurmslayer for months according to Cam and I don't think he is out of line to ask for it back.  You have promised the both of us that he would have it back &quot;tomorrow&quot; I don't know how many times.  Fact is, he lent you the WS and what you did with it after that doesn't matter, YOU OWE HIM A WURMSLAYER.  Its not like he needs the plat or the Wurmslayer (he has a very generous merchant friend ;p) its the whole avoidance and deception factor and I'm going to go out of my way to tell everyone what a low-life you really are.<br>

It is 1 thing to call me a thief and ebayer, but when you call me a liar, it really makes you down on my list. <p>Radic Goldenheart - Retired

Like I give a rats ass what you think, all I care about is my trusting friend Cambridge's trust being broken.  Cam has to be one of the nicest most trusting guys on the server and he only seems to get the shaft when he is being nice to people.<br>
