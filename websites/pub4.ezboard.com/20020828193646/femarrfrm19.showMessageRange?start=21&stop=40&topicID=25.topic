<br>
1. How much &quot;fun&quot; someone has in a game can effect their performance. If they find something you have to do, or should do, incredibly boring they may not be willing to do it. I doubt anyone could honestly say every moment they've spent on everquest was &quot;fun&quot;.<br>
<br>
2. This is somewhat linked to number 1. Some people don't really care how well they do in a game. Not everyone is willing to make the same sacrifice to their &quot;fun&quot; that you, or I, may be. Does this make a bad guildmate or player? I would say no, as I would never expect a friend of mine to do something he finds boring to the point that he does not want to play.<br>
<br>
3. You seem to assume all the &quot;good&quot; gamers are in powerguilds. Even with &quot;good&quot; gamers, more time = faster leveling. Therefore, non powergaming &quot;good&quot; gamers will fall behind the level curve of powergaming &quot;good&quot; players.<br>

<br>
I was trying to point out that playing a game that requires an amount of strategy in RvR. If you take a break, or if you don't play all the time, you won't be able to get practiced well enough to take out battle hardened people. Okay, lemme sum it up.<br>
<br>
Warrior 1 fights some times, he doesn't practice swinging his sword, he can't hit as well. He doesn't know all the ways he can be attacked and what every spell every other player has and how to counteract them.<br>
<br>
Now here comes Warrior 2. He fights all the time, he studies the enemy. He spends half his day practicing new ways to slice and dice. He knows how to fight in a battle and has alot of experience.<br>
<br>
Now they meet, and fight. Who the fuck is gonna win?<br>
<br>
For those of you who think warrior 1 because he's just naturaly good at being a warrior. You are fucked in the head. There has never been on Earth a person that could take down a Navy Seal just because he has the mind set of one already and enjoys being a Navy Seal alot.<br>
<br>
No unpracticed person can compare to someone who has trained in every way to kick your ass.<br>
<br>
practice makes perfect the saying goes. This is true even in games, bike riding, running, swimming, ettiqute. And any other fucking thing you can think of. If you do not have any physical or mental handicaps .You can do ANYTHING if you practice enough. <br>
<br>
Time spent in the field, is time practiced. Someone who doesn't do this all the time is going to lose to the one that did.<br>
<br>
Now, let's repeat to get the point across. A large uberguild and it's uberguild ally's will steamroll any not so well organized groups attempt to kill them. PERIOD<br>
<br>
Just because this group of inexperienced fighters may be &quot;naturally better at the game&quot; doesn't mean shit to guys with that much more experience under their belt, god damn.<br>

<br>
Why can  &quot;Uber-Guild A&quot; take out Naggy say while a pick-up raid fails?<br>
<br>
Because the people in UGA are focused and have dicipline.<br>
<br>
I dont know how many pick-up naggy raids in the past I've seen fail because so and so fell into the lava/was playing with the bridge/was oom at the pull/was afk/wandered off in the wrong direction/agroed naggy early/forgot to bring thier resist gear/etc/etc/etc.<br>
<br>
This stuff NEVER happens with a top orginized guild.<br>
<br>
This almost ALWAYS happens with a pick-up raid.<br>
<br>
I think in RvR it will even show the difference between the casual player (read not Diciplined) and the Uber player (read Diciplined). <br>
<br>
I think a real world example is in order, lets say you take a unit of Elite Marines who train for battle every day.<br>
<br>
Put them at the end of a field.<br>
<br>
Now take a unit of National Guard who only practice being soldiers on every third weekend and put them at the other end.<br>
<br>
Give them equil equipment.<br>
<br>
and let them play capture the flag....<br>
<br>
Who do you think is going to win, every time.<br>
<br>
Now you say the guards will get better, yes. BUT so will the marines, they won't be standing still and will always be ahead of the guards.<br>
<br>
Another point, I'm not sure how much equipment makes a difference in DaoC but you know the leets will always have the best gear.<br>

PS Glurg, the ONLY reason there are Pick-up raids on the two dragons is because of the 52 or boot rule, its been a long standing joke in the top guilds that we should level up a bunch of twinks to 52 and take them over again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugurglespitfruggybasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurglespit Fruggybasher</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://dyce.i8.com/gurblip.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1297<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/9/01 11:33:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conquest and Da'kor of Merlin</span><hr size=1> I was in a pickup raid on naggy last night.. we only lost one person and that was the chanter who suicide tashed (ran in at the beginning and chain casted tash till it stuck then switched to slow trying to get it to stick..)<br>
<br>
I know the uberguilds are going to be stronger.. but the point I am trying to make is there are what.. 50 people maybe in conquest.. and maybe 20 people in da`kor (rough estimates..)  that is 70 hardcore people.. now how many people are on the merlin server at peak times?? I usually see near 2000.  So the other we divide the 2000 by 3 and we get 667 per realm.. so there are 1200 other people that will be up there and able to fight against da`kor and  conquest eventually (granted it will take time) <br>
<br>
Now using that same analogy you used.. you take 70 marine special forces and put them at one end of the field and you take 1200 national guard on the other end.. you still think those 70 marines are gonna waltz in and take the flag?? they have to get through a thousand people.. while still guarding thier own.. <br>
<br>
and if you are thinking... well what about he 600 other merlin people.. sure they may be able to help the 70 ubers.. but then again there will be some &quot;ubers&quot; mixed in with the 1200 others as well.. it will all even out as all the casual gamers level up and the &quot;ubers&quot; won't make as big of a difference as I think most people are thinking they will<br>

In Myth you had series of games where troop selection, tactics, teamwork were extremely important. Beyond that micro managment defined the top few players and clans from the rest. In a sense Daoc is similar because the PVP requires the same decisions to be made. However in Daoc you will have inbalances in troo numbers. Tactics and teamwork are extremely important as is micro management.<br>
<br>
I went for my first RvR experience last night and well got owned. It was good for the experience because I had no real knowledge of what the landscape was and who I was fighting. We didn't have tactical battle plans so of course we were going to get owned. People who play more will always have the advanteg because more experience will give you an advantage. What Tuan is saying that there is also a difference between players in skill and most of that is determined by your ability to take advantage of your advantage or be able to understand the scenario as it layed out for you. <br>
<br>
It looks like RvR would actually be much more fun with 300+ people on each side. Lag of course would be an issue but the battles will be long and require detailed planning and excution. You won't blindly stumble into taking a keep as easy as it may seem now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrechdashadowknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trech Da ShadowKnight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 414<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/9/01 2:42:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conquest and Da'kor of Merlin</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I was in a pickup raid on naggy last night<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

(I would not know, I have not seen them)<br>
<br>
I dont see 'elite/uber' play in any case. What I see is, good planning<br>
and utilization of time and resources.<br>
Information is power, and certain organizations have a great deal of<br>
information. They got them by (for example) being in Beta.<br>
They also share information between themselves. that avoids duplication of effort.<br>
<br>
To be a good organizer and planner, and for that matter diplomat<br>
(since the 'alliance' was hammered out even before DAOC opened)<br>
<br>
These abilities lie in the realm of grand strategy. Surely they assist greatly<br>
in aquiring whatever goals you set, THAT is true. However as I have<br>
said many time before, that doesnt make you 'elite'. It just makes you 'wise'<br>
<br>
It would be intresting to see what would happen in a blank template.<br>
A game enviorment that allowed NO Beta-testers to garner information.<br>
Where ALL people/players started with the same information. I think<br>
things would turn out a bit differently. In fact I am certain of it.<br>
But no such game enviorment exists, so for now the point is moot.<br>
<br>
True elite players would dive right in, making good on whatever their<br>
skills happen to be. Some however would stand back, intimidated<br>
by an equal playing field. So which are you? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uelnotssadnes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elnots Sadnes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/11/01 3:16:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conquest and Da'kor of Merlin</span><hr size=1> You have to love the people that answer everyone's problems by saying either live with it or get lost.<br>

And Trech spoke it true. Most casual players don't have the communication network or evem desire to be part of a 1200 man army. Even roughly estimating.. just a bunch of people that say, hey! Let's go kill Conquest! Pick up everyone! Will probably end up with at most 100 people. While Conquest calls it's members on the phone to get them online and at the front line within an hour.<br>

I was not whining because all my realms forts had been taken over and we didn't stand a chance of getting them back. Like those weak ass hiberions.<br>
<br>
All the uber guilds are on our side. I'm bitching that they took everything out and are keeping it that way. <br>
<br>
Now with the patch that made realms that have a shit load of forts have alot less gaurds at them, it's become so much easier that a group of 8 level 30's from a realm took out a few forts.<br>
<br>
Which means, now it is pointless to take over forts unless you're bored. Because with less gaurds it's alot less risky to attack. It's like, two people playing catch. If a fort's open, just grab some friends and go take it.  Expect an hour or two after you're gone that it will be taken over again by the other realms.<br>
<br>
Relic forts however are a different story. it takes so many people to do a succesful relic raid, that the lag is more worse than EQ GM events to the point that no one can move and so when a group of 3 or 4 gaurds run into the midst of everyone. No one can do shit about it! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1871<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/13/01 10:29:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conquest and Da'kor of Merlin</span><hr size=1> I think the idea behind reducing the number of guards is to give players incentive to defend their keeps.

Make timelines apply to each character!Falling behind? You no longer exist to the player who is 30+ hours ahead of you or 30+ hours behind you? How is this good? I will lose too many friends you say?<br>
I dunno I think it solves a lot of problems. <br>
<br>
1. Camping..you don't have to worry about every area being over hunted or camped because you will only compete against those in your same timeline.<br>
<br>
2. If you have a lot of Pvlver's competing at high level on the same timeline they will now have something to truly brag about. Now when they say they are the ones playing the 'real hard' game ..they will be right cause they will have real competition.<br>
<br>
3. If you don't like the fact you fell so far behind, you can do a quest to 'time warp to another time zone. Beware though you will probably be far behind your 'peers' hehe<br>
<br>
4. Casual play will be rewarded well. You play 2 hours a week you are stuck on the same timeline as everyone else who plays 2 hours a week.<br>
<br>
5. Hate that guy that always logs on whenyou do? don't play the game for a few days and he is gone! Or do that quest and run away from him..he's out of your life for some time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Nobody should HAVE to play with someone they think is an asshole.(Unless that is what turns em on I guess..seems to be a lot out there)<br>

Now I know we don't have a game today that does this but I think it could be a great idea. I would certainly try it out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
  You have to admit time is a factor in EQ bro. You are talking about people with a natural affinity for something vs people that do not. That is a valid point. Unless your guild weeds out people with this natural affinity somehow, you have people with characters that don't have it. That is just a given even based on what you are saying. <br>
<br>
   For example, how many people have this affinity with EVERY single one of the character types in EQ? How many could be Best of the Best at ALL of the characters? Proly not many right?<br>
<br>
  Dosen't matter how good you are if you don't have the time you can never get full planar armor for example.<br>
<br>
  To say that people who are uber are just uber because they are better in EQ, is like saying every good martial artist is just good because he is naturally talented. I've seen extremely talented martial artists get creamed by the guy who is the stone cold hard trainer. He is just in such good condition that you can't stop the guy! Now that guy with the flashy talent might have much greater potential, but if he dosen't develop it he will begin to suck in some ways.<br>
<br>
   There are people who are clueless who never learn over and over. But by the same token even every 'expert' has areas they can improve. If you are truly good at anything that is worth being good at that is one of the first things you realize. In fact I challenge how good you really are if you say you happened upon the right combinations right away in the game. Just because those combo's worked dosen't mean they were the best under those situations? Many combinations of things work! Don't you ever try out new combo's? I think you do! If you didn't experiment and improve, optimize your skills then you woulden't be the best. You would just be lucky! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  There is one other type and that is the Savant. He is good at everything right away, dosen't work out much and just kills. Maybe you are psyching up all your friends by trying to say you are a savant or they are for being uber, but the rarity of savants is such that you probably only have a handfull playing EQ if one even exists yet. Maybe you are a savant. If you are and all your friends are then you have the right to say what you did in your post and get away with it. Otherwise I think you are far overblowing the importance of your accomplishments.<br>

<br>
couple things...<br>
the original keeps mid took over were not pc defended.  conquest went after them because they wanted to be the first to take over some keeps.  they got hibernia completely taken over and then took over a couple of ours and we decided hell no, we didn't feel like getting rolled when there was fun to be had defending.  <br>
<br>
during the first pc defended keep raid, we had about ten people inside the keep.  mids came up and those ten pc's kept them at bay long enough for the defenders to assemble and get to the keep under seige.  just barely though, they were fighting in the courtyard by the time the back up arrived.<br>
<br>
so far, every pc defended keep that has gone under seige has resulted in failed attempts.  it's fun as hell though.  <br>
<br>
if you have levels, taking an npc defended keep is cake.  even we can do it, and for awhile, albion was the weakest, furthest behind realm on merlin.  but we got spunk.  <br>
<br>
regarding the casual gamers..well, that one is easy.  if you are a crappy powergamer and level real fast and go out pvping, you'll harm your realm as much as any casual gamer could.  if you are a good casual gamer, you will aid the realm more than a crappy powergamer, and as much as a good one.  <br>
<br>
the way i see it is like this.  because there is a cap, everyone will eventually be on equal footing, right?  well, just because someone is a casual gamer does not mean they suck.  the flaw in all those analogies everyone is putting up is that there are extremes on both sides.  that is not the case in this game.  as was pointed out above.  casual gamer A B and C can go out with powergamers and be just as good as the opposing realm that are filled with powergamers...if the casuals are decent or the powers are not awful.  believe me, i see a lot of clueless powers in albion everyday...<br>
<br>
so instead of putting the marines on one side and the guard on the other, put a few guards in with one side and a few marines with the others.  leaders will naturally fall into place as the most experienced and capable, and it will be a more even fight.  that is daoc.<br>

As I said, there is a time factor in anything, but I honestly don't think it's as much as people think.  Like, I see people who are 50-60 playing that are retarted in terms of playing this game, and then there are a lot that I just don't think understand how to play or something, doing the same stupid things over and over.<br>
<br>
All I was saying is that from my own experiences there are some people that just can understand how games fast and efficiently, those are usually the people having the most fun to because they see the game as more than a game, but a challenge to do the best, but still in a fun way.<br>
<br>
