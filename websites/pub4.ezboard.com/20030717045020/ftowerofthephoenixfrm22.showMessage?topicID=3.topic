<br>
Greetings traveler. We, The Council of the Phoenix, wish you welcome to our home. Please join us for a moment so that we might get to know you better. It has come to our attention that you seek adventure, lore, and fame. While we can not guarantee such things, perhaps it is enough to know that with us you find family and comrades to go with you in search of these things you seek. If you have not read our charter, perhaps now would be the time, but if you feel that our guild has what you seek please continue.<br>
<br>
By what name will we know you?<br>
<br>
<br>
The gods have seen to it that Norrath and her Moon are filled with a plethora of unique beings, humans, elves, dwarfs, what might you be?<br>
<br>
<br>
There are many callings in life, from that of the mighty warrior to the cunning thief. Tell us what class of adventure are you?<br>
<br>
<br>
When night falls and the fire grows low, what god might you give silent prayer to so that you might wake in the morning to find yourself still of this world?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ah these are fine choices indeed. Tell us how long have you honed your skills in this field? (What level are you?)<br>
<br>
<br>
Norrath is vast. Tell us do you scrounge through The Ruins of Kunark, do battle with giants and dragons in the Scars of Velious, explore the vast Shadows of Luclin, visit the gods in their Planes of Power, or perhaps seek the lost lore of The Legacy of Yeshka?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ah you sound quite the adventurer indeed. Tell us do find your fill of excitement and danger in this guise, or do you seek most of your adventures under another name?(Is this your main or alt)<br>
<br>
<br>
We would like to know why you have made some of your choices. What attracted you to the race, class and deity you have chosen?<br>
<br>
<br>
Very well, tell us what do you hope to find in your adventures through out the lands of Norrath? Fame, perhaps infamy? Do you seek ungodly power, or do you hope to find only the power needed to protect yourself and others? Do you hope to horde vast fortunes of coin and powerful artifacts or do you only seek a more humble lifestyle?<br>
<br>
<br>
It’s certain that you have already had a great many adventures. Tell us what has been one of your most fulfilling moments while adventuring across Norrath? Might you also tell us about one of you not so memorable adventures?<br>
<br>
<br>
Awe those were interesting tales indeed. Now we would like to know if you have spent anytime in the ranks of another guild.  If you have, could we ask how long you were with that guild, and why you left?<br>
<br>
<br>
Now we must let you know some of the rules and principals that we hold high within the guild.  One we wish you to understand that this is a game, and as such will be treated as a game.  It is also a game that you play with many other people, some strangers, others friends.  We want to make it clear that your actions both with in the guild and the public game channels is something the Council keeps track of because said actions reflect upon the guild.  Complaints from other players will be noted and investigated; rude and hurtful comments in any channels are not accepted.  If you receive multiple warnings from the Council about your in game habits you will be asked to leave the guild.  We ask that if you have an issue with another player that you please bring it to the Council’s attention so that we might sort things out.  The Phoenix of the Flame strives to be a group of friends above all other things.  Do you understand?<br>
<br>
<br>
We, the Council of the Phoenix, would like to thank you for your time and your interest in our guild. Sadly sometimes it is hard to get a hold of people while we all adventure about Norrath. Perhaps you could tell us where we might be able to get a hold of you, perhaps an e-mail address or an instant messenger name of some kind?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much. Lastly we would like to offer you the chance to ask any questions you might have as well as include any other information that you think might be useful in helping us get to know you. Perhaps you adventured in a past life in another online world? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once gain thanks for your time, The Council of the Phoenix. <br>
<br>
