Mithril Web, The Shadow Order, Leo/Cicely open mon/wed night raids, ROA, and I think Dark Trinity started going there eventually too (and before they went away Dark Trinity was in HOT more often than any other guild for a while)<br>
<br>
It was easy then for me to check on TSO, MW, DT if it wasn't a monday or wednesday night to make sure that we didn't conflict.  I never asked, I always said, &quot;just FYI riders is gonna be in HoT all day tommorrow&quot; or something like that.  If thye told me they had something big planned, I would work something out (usually just reschedule) but most of the time they said that would be fine.<br>
<br>
But not I didn't see hardly any &quot;guild only&quot; raids on HoT except for ROA.  This is why problems are coming up now.  More and more often people are trying to organize open HoT raids on any old days (we used to plan around monday and wednesday) and the calendar would benefit these people a LOT.  For ROA HoT farm is something that is for 18-24 people for a few hours, most of these raids have 36+ people with anyone level 52+ welcome it seems.<br>
<br>
Personally I feel really squeamish about supporting HoT on the calendar, because I don't want HoT to come down to calendar camping like POF and POH are.  <br>
<br>
Also: who is this Vipar guy in Vita?  Is he an officer or something?  He is the guy that I dealt with about the afformentioned raid that we didn't leave or move into the exit for.  I tried hard at first to work something out with him but he was a supreme ass, all he wanted to do was scream at me.<br>

<br>
Vipar was the raid leader for Vita from the other night.  I haven't spoken with him outside of finding out the raid was cancelled so I don't really know the details of what happened.  I can see where you guys are coming from and don't think you did anything wrong that night, especially considering your past experience with how HoT scheduling was handled.  At the same time I can understand why Vipar may have been upset after taking the time to put his raid together along with a different understanding of HoT scheduling.  Hopefully both sides can take a step back and be understanding in this situation as any lingering ill-feelings only cause more problems in the future.<br>
<br>
I'll speak with my GL and have him take a peek in the private forum, if you need to contact me directly regarding that other issue you can use Brask@oboo.org<br>

<br>
I can not see any valid reason not using the calendar. The more readily available Information is, the better. One problem is there's no list of what is considered &quot;Calendar Worthy&quot;. <br>
<br>
Perhaps we can all come to some agreement and the moderators can add the list to the forum rules. Spell it out. Mobs/zones a, b, c, are ok. Mobs/zones d, e, f are FFA.<br>
It really seems like simple stuff. There's no way to ensure that all guilds follow this though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The whole tell idea is lacking IMHO. You could get he said she said type stuff going on. I also don't think it's practical to hunt down people from the various guilds and get their ok.<br>
One simple post is all that is needed. <br>
<br>
As far as zones being able to support two raids, that's fine. We should still post our intent though. Like Arena or King raids in Kael.<br>
<br>
Lets face it, it sucks to have a change in plans at the last moment. This calendar can limit those situations.<br>
<br>
Btw, Vipar is a HC member of VI and was also leading the raid.<br>

Lots of times I just get a tell from someone organizing an impromptu mini raid (2 groups) or a guild chat saying talk to soandso if I want to go to HoT.  I almost never go to a scheduled HoT raid anymore accept our once every 2 week HoT thingy we trying to do.<br>
<br>
I guess the guild leaders of the pro-dragon guilds doing hot should talk about it some in their forum.  Whatever decided is fine with me.  But understand that Hot can support multiple raids at once.  It's just a mattter of the second group being willing to move deeper into hot. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

<br>
In my opinion, a good guideline to determine if something is worthy of including on the calendar is if these sorts of discussions come about in this forum over conflicts about who is in what zone when. If there begins to be a problem, then the default, simplest answer is to put it on the calendar and have raid leaders check the calendar before heading out. It's a tool to facilitate communication, and that alone makes it so much easier to work these things out ahead of time.<br>

Sola, that's a bad excuse and you know it.  Angry tells are caused by miscommunication.  So you're going to respond by perpetuating the miscommunication?  Or are you going to rise above it and try to work something out anyways?<br>

Clerics and melees?  Heck just ask me, although I think peeps are finally getting the idea that HoT bores me to tears and no I won't go for a_random_peep_00 to farm armor, but I still say no to 4 or more HoT raids per week it seems. :P<br>

Reading something like this saddens me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   No I don't check the calendar either unless I am hosting a raid, but darned straight I still do that.  Is it that Rota is getting to the point that they no longer need the calendar so they will not check it out of respect for those who still do?  I will also strongly STRONGLY disagree that a tell is more efficient.  Do I need to /tell every guild on the server who has a capable raid leader when I plan on doing HoT?  How do I find out who might be thinking of doing it on a given day?  How do I ensure that they will remember exactly when I planned on doing HoT so as to avoid conflict?  I have a hard enough time finding out who a raid leader is when I have ONE raid I am conflicting with and it is GOING ON AT THE TIME, much less trying to find out who *might* think about leading a HoT raid at some future date and time when I am thinking of leading one.<br>

<br>
Any calendar camping is in your own head.  I'm not going to repeat the freaking calendar rules here because goshdarnit you oughta be able to recite them in your sleep by now Errtai.  If I want a PoH or a PoF raid I schedule it whenever I want and I work it out with anyone who has any conflicts.  I have never camped the calendar, I never will, and I have no respect for those who do so and think they have some sort of priority over everyone else.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW, TRK has never been considered a raiding guild and we don't get put in the &quot;top 4 dragon guilds&quot; or whatever it is called, but we have had peeps going to HoT since only IF + friends did it, we still have peeps who go frequently and/or lead raids there, and we have many who sign up for said raids using the calendar and raids forum.  So I feel like I have had and do still have some valid input on the matter. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udaalesrainstorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daales Rainstorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/20/01 12:16:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1609.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/daalesrainstorm/images/daaleshead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> <br>

What is missing from this thread that it was resolved with a rep from Vita, Simc and I. It was Vipar that was pushing it with Errtai, and he woudlnt stop.<br>
<br>
As to your previous comments, your right, i dont like the fact of taking 3 or 4 experianced groups further into the halls unless there is a group at the entrance already, no where to avoid AoE wanderers, etc. I also like your idea that if a 2nd raid ventures further in that the 1st raid would assist with the CR.<br>
<br>
Something else that came to light is this, not very many guilds are going in there anymore, but i always see throw together raids there which is really cool, since it is really easy to do just need a 60 shaman ( ask beomahn when he is not on and busy /grin ) but that brings up a point, RoA has enough to do it guild only, and yeah more times then not we are going to accomodate to those few tells we get do you have room, but other times, like the other day, we wanted to just farm armor for our new members, and get the rest of the bp, robes etc that we need for those on last piece.<br>
<br>
Since i dont see to many guild only in there i think it needs to be on the calander now, now im not talking if some friends want to get together and the 10 of them go rampage HoT dont post, but like the post for yesterday, someone said they wanted Hot for 12 hours, and since i lead open raids i know how many people show up for &quot;open&quot; HoT. Posts like that need to be put up and respected just like Amori's post for a dozer attempt later today, otherwise more miscommunication is going to happen and more incidents like this will occur.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: Adjani, Gusiam said that because since she stopped hosting PoH, she normally does not host raids. I take care of 99% of roa's raids, and I always check to see if a raid is going on, however since HoT was not campable etc i did not bother to look. <p><center><embed width="200" height="125" src="http://www.crocker.com/~denise/solasig.swf"></embed>

I'll agree the higher lvl mobs drop more often and can do multiple drops.  If you have a CR in the tunnel near the exit, it is gonna trash your average.   Typical kill rate being 1 per 15 min, trying for 1 per 5.  Usually you run into mana issues.<br>
<br>
Wiping out on the platform is a quick CR...<br>
Tunnels are more interesting though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Gotta kick the people on the platform, and keep em awake.<br>

<br>
I had planned that HoT raid a week in advance, with 36 people from 3 guilds signed up. I posted it on the Lanys calendar to display my intent to the server. I realize that the calendar is not a reservation system and that HoT is not considered a &quot;camp&quot; by many. I had HOPED that people would check the calendar anyway, as I always do, just to see what others are doing in-game, and be considerate enough to respect that. Guess I was wrong with people like Errtai in the game.<br>
<br>
When I logged on an hour before the raid that night, I was immediately told by guildmates that ROA had jumped the raid, and were forming up in ToV. I contacted someone named Simc, who was apparently the raid leader, and explained that Vita had a raid scheduled there and had posted in a week in advance. My response from simc was basically, Sorry, this is a ffa camp so we aren't leaving. That's when I got pissed, because nothing makes me more angry than the selfish, lack of respect for other people so prevalent in this game. After arguing with Simc for sometime, I was contacted by Errtai, who is apparently the guild leader or an officer of ROA. Errtai explained that HoT was ffa according to the lanys boards, and sorry but they were not leaving. I responded that I still thought it showed a real lack of common courtesy for ROA to jump us like that, and that Vita would not have done this to ROA, we respect the calendar and it doesn't matter to me personally what is considered &quot;campable&quot; and &quot;ffa&quot; - if I see someone had posted that they wanted to run a raid on a certain day, I would not jump them or interfere with them. <br>
<br>
Errtai also told me they would not leave the platform, but why didn't I just take my raid to the exit in HoT? I responded that I didn't know that area and didn't want to risk a total wipeout there with a possible nightmare CR. My raid did not have enough high-levellers to make that feasible IMO. I had also checked with others about that possibility and were told that it was a very nasty area and would definitely end in a wipeout with the levels I had signed up. I also did not feel confident that I could ask ROA for help with a CR, if their attitude was basically going to be &quot;Too bad&quot;. I will not blindly lead a raid to disaster.<br>
<br>
Errtai, you told me that ROA wanted HoT to be a camp that would be always listed on the calendar as well and even debated for it on the lanys boards, but that the majority disagreed with you, so you considered it FFA. You also stated that because of that ROA never checks the lanys calendar to see if any HoT raids have been posted. You also said that you knew this was going to happen eventually. You also told me that if I had given you a tell letting you know that Vita was planning it, that you wouldn't have jumped us. And that I should post on your message board each time Vita wants to run a HoT raid. Yet you won't even bother to look at the calendar because it's considered FFA? I am not about to go sending tells to every guild leader of officer of every guild on the server, nor am I going to go to every single guilds message board and post. That's why the calendar is there. What you were saying only made me angrier because it made no sense and was hypocritical. On the other side of the coin, I don't believe ROA has EVER bothered to contact Vita in any way, shape or form ahead of time to let us know what YOU were planning.<br>
<br>
Vita has a rep as an honorable guild, and we've earned that rep. I know what goes into planning a big raid - the time, the effort, getting the right classes, levels, and people to show up. For something like HoT I needed to plan well in advance because the majority of the raid was going to be people around level 54-56, not something that could just be done spur of the moment with only two groups.<br>
<br>
Let me say that I value everything that lanys.com is doing for the server. It's a great service to us all, and shows its intent to help foster a respect for common courtesy and friendship in this game, which all-too-often gets smothered by some of the more immature players in the game, which unfortunately there seems to be a lot of. Whether a raid spot is condsidered FFA or not, I'll continue to post my raids on the Lanys calender for the benefit of all, and I will continue to honor others raid intents. I dunno, I guess I'm just a supreme ass.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       <br>
<br>
I do apologize to Simc and to Errtai for getting angry in my tells to them, however my initial tells to Simc were polite IMO. I just don't respond well to the attitude of, Gee we're sorry that you planned this well ahead of time and made the effort to get so many to come, but we don't check to see what others are doing here and we're not going to do anything about it. Better luck next time. Call me a supreme ass, but for some strange reason this just irks me. Go figure.<br>
<br>
In response to Solanthius' post, I never used the term &quot;raid-crusher&quot; nor did I call anyone a &quot;fooking liar&quot;. While I was very angry and did make some comments about what I felt was a real lack of respect and honor on ROA's part, I did not resort to name-calling. <br>
<br>
In the future, I'll gladly let Errtai know of my plans and maybe we can work things out in a friendlier way. I had avoided making a post of any kind here because I hate childish flame wars and was willing to drop it. However, if I see my name getting besmirched here, I'm going to respond to it. <p><img src="http://www.vitainfinita.com/images/sigs/vipsig.jpg">

<br>
You didn't really try to compromise.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mebbe (just a suggestion here)**********<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, who is the raid leader tonight?&quot;<br>
- start with a salutation.  find out who is running the show<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, I was hoping/planning to raid HoT tonight, I've got about 30 people from 3 guilds lined up&quot;<br>
- say hi to the raid leader, let him know what you represent<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think my raid would survive at the exit, would you mind taking exit?&quot;<br>
- suggest an alternative<br>
<br>
&quot;Can we please roll to see who gets the platform?&quot;<br>
- another alternative, be polite<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd really hate to tell 30 people the raid is canceled, can't we please work something out&quot;<br>
- last ditch plea, again state what you represent<br>
<br>
You'll get further with honey than vinegar.<br>
Understandably you were upset, but you owed it to your raid to be clear, polite, and negotiate. <br>
<br>
Worse case<br>
- move the raid to something else<br>
- reschedule<br>
<br>
<br>
I know hindsight is 20/20.  (meaning clearer)<br>
It's just a thought for next time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/u00vipar00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>00Vipar00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/24/01 10:14:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1609.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.vitainfinita.com/images/sigs/vipsmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> No, I never told them to get the hell out.

<br>
I will admit that I got more angry than perhaps I should have allowed myself to get from a response like that, but it was made very clear that their attitude was not going to be one of compromise of any kind.<br>
<br>
The raid was moved to Kael instead, although we lost probably half those who'd signed up because they wanted HoT.<br>
<br>
Your suggestions for a friendlier way of dealing with it are good ones, and I wish that's the way it could have been. <br>

We would not have gone at all.  But, as it was decided months ago that HoT was going to stay ffa.  We had asked around and no one doing ToV that usually does it.  So we went.

If all the guild leaders of the pro dragon guild could please address it on their board, I am sure that very one will be happy with the decisions.  The pro-dragon guilds seem to work really well together on lots of things.  I don't see this would be any different in the leader finding a good common decision for us to follow.<br>
<br>
Yes, folks that set up raids for hate and fear and vox and naggy do check and respect the calendar.  It is just that hot was one that was decide not to list before.  Maybe it has come time where hot raids would have to be listed as the number of guild that can do this increase.  It is just a communication tool after all. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>
