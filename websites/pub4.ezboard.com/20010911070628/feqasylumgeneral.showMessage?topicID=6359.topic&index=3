He looks like jesus to start with, hes a stage hand and had stole a jesus robe from a theater.  He wore it to the pool hall, and if you seen my pic I kinda look evil.<br>
<br>
So heres evil guy throwing darts with jesus at the pool hall.  The people loved us, they would come up and bull shit with us.  Well eventually the pool hall owner cut us off, so we enlisted one of our new found friends to buy us a pitcher.  Sure enough the owner comes up and calls us thieves.  Claiming we stole the pitcher.<br>
<br>
/boggle<br>
<br>
Well this is were it gets interesting.  Jesus, my friend, begins to argue with the owner.  The owner simply says sign your bill and leave.  Jesus demands an apollogy and invitation back.  Meanwhile Im on the pay phone laughing with a friend about the scene, which I might add was beautifull.<br>
<br>
After a quite long repetion of sign now and leave and apollogize and invite back, the local boys in blue roll in.  I quickly tell my friend on the phone I must go.<br>
<br>
As Im leaving I see my friend, Jesus, being grabed by the arm by one of our finest, and wouldnt you know jesus tries to free his arm.  Big mistake.  I witness jesus flying through the air, being "subdued".<br>
<br>
Did I mention he was wearing a propellar bennie with a pig at the base of the propellar?<br>
<br>
Well, I must say that was a sight worth a 100 camels, but as I made my escape I was detained also.  Although it wasnt needed to wrestle me into cuffs.<br>
<br>
As Im sitting infront of the magistrate, here comes my friend, jesus, escorted by the new centurions.  He is screaming about injustice and how hes being arrested for being drunk but was never tested.  If he had claimed that he thought it was just water, and didnt know it became wine when he touched it I would have died on the spot.<br>
<br>
Anyways, in my inebriated state,  watching my friend, jesus, struggle against the authority sent me back in time. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwithincalmseas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Within Calmseas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.gifs.net/animate/dna.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/10/01 2:01:36 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.gifs.net/animate/gears.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strangest Experience</span><hr size=1> <br>
In Game:<br>
When the graphics mess up and the whole world turns white, or all black.  Sometimes the wood panneling on the boat has wierd faces on it.  I have some really strange .jpgs of graphic errors.<br>
<br>
IRL:<br>
Half-way through a midnight theatre performance at my college some dude leaps on stage totally naked except for a mask covering his face.  He jumps up and down for like a minute before one of the cast members grabs his arm and says, "Time to go penis-boy" and shows this guy the door.<br>
<br>
The flasher was so out of place.  I remember looking over at a friend I had come with and saying, "What was that all about?"<br>

Faces not wear they were supposed to be with just a weird blank spot where it should have been and stuff.<br>
<br>
As for real life, I was driving along this road to visit a friends house.  As I was driving, I almost ended up hitting this girl (about 8-10 years old) because she just crossed in front of me(chasing after a soccerball).  I slammed on the breaks and avoided hitting her.  I got out of the car to see if she was ok.  She seemed like she was in shock.  She said her name was Melanie. It was kind of late so I asked her if she was going home.  She said yes.  I offered Melanie a ride home because the place we were at was not a safe place for a child to be walking about at night time.  So she gets in the car and she tells me where her house is.  We get to the house and I pull into the driveway.  I get out of the car and head up to the door to explain about giving their daughter a ride home since I almost hit her (hopefully to make the parents more aware of how dangerous that street is as well as to let them know that the stranger that brought her home was not some weirdo).  So I ring the door bell and a woman comes to the door.  I tell the woman that I almost hit Melanie with my car and that I gave her a ride home.  The woman gets a sad and concerned look on her face.  She then says &quot;I am sorry for your trouble, but Melanie has been dead for 7 years now.  She was hit by a car crossing the street.  You are not the first to try to bring her home.&quot;  I then look in my car and Melanie is gone, but the soccerball is still there. <p><img src=http://wsphotofews.excite.com/026/Wa/ze/db/kD45531.jpg> <BR> </p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.showMessage?topicID=6422.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.showMessage?topicID=6390.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=6359.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.threadControl?topicID=6359.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6359.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6359.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumbiographiessharesomeinfoaboutyourself">Biographies <option value="eqasylumplayerrunquestsorganizeandfindactorsfordynamicquests">Player Run Quests <option value="eqasylumlookingforgroupannounceplanorjoinraidsandgroups">Looking for group!!!! <option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral>General</a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
