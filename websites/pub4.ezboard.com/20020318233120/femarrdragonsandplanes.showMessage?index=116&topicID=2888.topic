If a better item drops and a person calls need on that because its an upgrade, why wouldn't they be willing to random the upgraded item alpha 1-5?<br>
<br>
What makes it ok for that person to replace their uber cloak of ass-slapping with a more uber cloak of ass-munching then run off to EC and sell the old one? <br>
<br>
Seems to me that the only one who benefits out of that is the NBG guy. What about the other 5 people that didn't get squat for the day, and he gets an upgrade AND a pile of plat.<br>
Doesn't seem fair to me, but I play NBG in all the pickup groups I've ever been in. I like the theory and seeing someone get a new toy.<br>
<br>
By the way, the spells argument is crap since most all the spells that do drop are as common as FS anyways. Anyone else have 20+ spells sitting in bags cause its not worth the time to go sell them? I sell most to vendors for 15pp and save the hassle of E-Bay commons to earn a whopping 50pp. The good ones are so very rare and not on specific mobs. Its not like killing Cappy enough times and cobalt will drop. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udesbarolis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Desbarolis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 504<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/17/02 2:11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2888.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG is BS!</span><hr size=1> That's it Tyvalius, I'm taking you off the list of my clientelle.

<br>
If you enforce free for all on me then fine. But don't get your panties ina  bunch when Mark of Kharn drops (Or group Aego) and I quickly nail your ass tot he wall on your choice of loot rolls.<br>
<br>
All free for all is. Is an excuse to raise teh chances for people to get loot. The day I see a warrior leader sitting in on a trak raid call free random on a cobalt breastplate (when he doesnt have better) is the day I will agree to free for all. That person will stand by his beliefs. And I will stand by them.<br>
<br>
How is it right to have  mages roll on warrior gear. The mage contributed to the group, the mage got xp. That is his reward. If the camp happens to drop good meele gear consider that a bonus chance to get a meele in the group. <br>
<br>
If It drops kick ass cleric gear. You can be assured you will prolly have a cleric in the group. If It drops spells and warrior gear. Then It will be a nice mix.<br>
<br>
Free for alling all items is simply greedy people who want thiers now rather than enjoying seeing another get something. That or traders who want to sweetin the pot. <br>
<br>
I once saw a shadowknight tell the group while Feather was in cappy. He said 'Dont invite the warrior that is looking for a group, he will get the cobalt if it drops.&quot;  I left that group. <br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt; <br>
<br>
Arguing here isnt going to change anyones mind. Much like a ford / chevy  thing.  Or pepsi / Coke.  It comes down to personal preferance.<br>
<br>
I for one. Like to group because it is fun, sometimes loot is involved sometimes it is not. Sometimes spells are involved, sometimes not.  <br>
<br>
Just know this. I will not dick anyone over for loot. I will be as fair as I can while taking care of the people that are bleeding with me. And If you are an ass I will call you on it. And If I am an ass I expect you to call me on it.<br>

I didn't think so.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as MoK goes, I had to pay 13k to get my copy because I never saw it drop. Group Aego and other high end spells drop in areas that are generally too hard for a 6 man group (especially pick-up). So that isn't a vaild argument. Raids aren't what is in question in this discussion, but the friendly pick-up group is. Raid loot is always handed out on a need basis.<br>
<br>
You also never touched on the question I had of why it is ok for a person to call need then run off and sell the replaced item. I just don't get the logic in that.<br>
<br>
It seems that by and large the biggest supporters for NBG are melee, and I understand why. I also see how FFA can work too. If I won a sword on random and a spell dropped I can see how I could work a trade among the other members so that everyone is happy. <br>
<br>
Both practices have their good and bad points, but to totally discount one because it doesn't favor a particular class type is being bias. I use NBG all the time and think I may have gotten an item for it once though I can't recall,yet I still use it.<br>
<br>

<br>
I didn' see the part about you always NBG in pick ups. <br>
<br>
Sorry for the miscommunication. <br>
<br>
And It isnt right for someone to call Need then run and sell it. <br>
<br>
That however isnt Need before greeds fault. It is the persons. They can just as easily random on it win it and sell it.  Probably for more than the person in the group has anyways.<br>
<br>
I don't like free for all because of a simple reason. It takes gear for a type of class and puts it into the hands of another class. Much of the time when the other type of class is in the group. It seems like such a waste of time to make that class that fought and bled for the item to have to go buy it rather than wear it based on a die roll.<br>
<br>
I feel that way across the board. Caster gear. Meele gear. Preist gear. Spells. Selling the spill off loot from when something drops that noone can use doesnt bother me at all. What bothers me is the fact that a greedy person can go to a camp that drops something great and play the odds to get rich quick and win over someone who could use it right away.<br>
<br>
Now people who abuse need before greed and the trust of thier groupmates should be fucking drawn and quartered. But really. How many people win RBG's in a day. When someone NBG's one in a group and later that week doesnt have one and a twink/mule is selling an RGB then people need to know. So that dickhead can be shunned.<br>
<br>
Talk to people, keep track of the shits that abuse it and let others know. (With Proof of course)<br>

<br>
NBG is good, but their will always be the jerks out there who abuse it. Hell, look at how many threads start in this section because someone was busted pulling GBN.<br>
<br>
Think of all those that don't get caught though. Think of those folks selling the high pp stuff. How did they get it?<br>
<br>
I just don't see how if this system is working so well how people get these items to sell. I know there will always be the EC traders that do nothing but play EQ buy/sell (the original AA skill hehe), but where does an average player amass 100k while only getting the cash loots? It took me a month to pay off the loan on my MoK spell, and I only borrowed 9k on it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=2888.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=2888.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2888.topic&index=123><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2888.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2888.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2888.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2888.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
