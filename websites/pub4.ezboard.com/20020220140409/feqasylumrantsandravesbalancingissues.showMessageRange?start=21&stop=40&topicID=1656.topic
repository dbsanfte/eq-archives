The homo-sexuality issue was interwoven into all this in the original post. All the quotes are from the original post on this thread. You cant make those statements and say &quot;only respond to this part of my post and not this other part of my post&quot;. If he wanted this to be about the furby peeps, why even bring homosexuality into it? He attempted to paint these individuals with the &quot;wrongness&quot; of homosexuality. Why did he even give his views on homo-sexuality then? If it has to do with the furby peeps then we are still on track right? If it has nothing to do with the furby peeps then why did he comment on homosexuals at all then. He needs to make up his mind, is this about homosexuals or furbys, or both. Reading the original post it seemed to be about both. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueladamri2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eladamri2</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 2:01:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1656.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.blizzard.com/images/war3/units/blademaster-dither.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Furries.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm talking about mating displays between two male ostriches<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

They're not mating. Mating would require fertilization of an egg, and the production of offspring. I group homosexuality in the same group as bestiality, for personal pleasure and gratification only. I'm against it, but I honestly don't care what people do. I'm not going to accept it, I'm not going to be forced to like or support it, I'm not going to recognize it as a real alternative or minority. YOU can do whatever the hell you want, but no matter how out of place and wrong I think it is, I'm not going to bitch at you, or try to convince you to change. I'm not going to try and stop or restrict you, unless it interferes with my life. Sorry to go off topic, but looks like this thread is heading there. Everyone agrees furries are disgusting anyway. <p><BR>

Regarding the furby/homosexual thing, I still don't get what any of it's about to be honest.  So you dress up as a stuffed animal and have sex. Jeez, maybe you should dress up in leather instead. I mean, wearing dead cows is much better, isn't it?<br>

There was no real reason to bring homosexuality into, but certainly that didn't stop akanon's christian coalition gnome from posting either - not that anyone cared.<br>

So sex with protection of any kind with the express interest of NOT having children is not mating and also a perversion?<br>

Love is another good reason. Having sex with whatever YOU feel like is abusive of the practice of sex, and the pleasure it gives. Just the way I feel. <p><BR>

If they did, this would make them homosexuals.  This meaning, all other animals besides humans are heterosexual.  You have twisted the meaning of this word for your petty personal attacks.<br>
<br>
"I'm talking about two female geese sharing a nest on the tundra in northern Canada."<br>
<br>
Oh, and I suppose two male roommates in college are homosexual by your standards?  I'm really not understanding this.<br>
<br>
Also, this has nothing to do with my sexuality.  I'm old enough to make choices for myself.  And when I say "acceptance" jellah, im talking about the concept that being gay is as natural as being straight.  I will never believe that, that of the millions of years that animals have lived on this earth, all of them heterosexually mating, that suddenly, this one species, starts having sex with its own gender, and this is totally natural? And I suppose the loss of ozone over the north pole in the last 50 years is natural too, since it just seemed to happen while we were around?  I won't buy it.  That what I mean in terms of acceptance.<br>
<br>
In that sense, yes, its a fetish.  And no, animals don't have them.  It's an unnatural sexual habit.  Thats practically today's definition of the word fetish.  So how about you put away the dictionary anathae, and think for yourself.<br>
<br>
And no, I honestly don't give a shit that your a transsexual.  I think your a harpy thats just trying to get in a supportable flame like jellah because I've offended you in the past.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that im not so open-minded as some of you, and I actually judge things on my own rather than trying to be everyone's friend. <br>
<br>
Oh, and let me address this:<br>
<br>
"My son exists whether they like it or not, I exist whether they like it or not, their non-acceptance dosent change this a bit."<br>
<br>
Then why the fuck do you care so much about my acceptance that you would post all that?  Honestly, some people here are just beyond me.<br>
<br>
So, if its not apparent, Thank you so much for totally de-railing my thread on a subject that it was foolish for you to address in the first place.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uazuzaisbetterthanyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azuza is better than you</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://azuza.homestead.com/files/flashing.GIF" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Azuza > You</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 2:34:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1656.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.squaregamer.com/forum/avatars/ff10/Auron001.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Furries.</span><hr size=1> "The homo-sexuality issue was interwoven into all this in the original post."<br>

<br>
/roleplay ranter on<br>
1) I have something on my chest, and it's not boobies because I'm not transgendered, so I'll write something for the citizens of Lanys T'vyl server.<br>
<br>
2) I'll do this fully knowing that everyone will agree with me, and in doing so, gain some small social acceptance I miss in real life, or better yet, some fucktard will respond negatively to my well reasoned wordings and then I can absolutely pwn them so I can feel a small measure of satisfaction that I miss in real life.<br>
<br>
3) I should probably mention something regarding homosexuality, because I'm not a latent homosexual at all, and I'm comfortable with my current condition, and look down on anyone that does not correspond to my exact same socioeconomic conditions, and does not currently live their life in accordance to my values and morals.<br>
<br>
4) Maybe, if things go alright, someone will recognize me for the really great and non-bigoted person I am.  Really.<br>

Frankly I think someone who fucks plush toys goes way beyond heterosexual or homosexual.<br>
<br>
The fact that they choose to identify themselves as heterosexual or homosexual really has no bearing on this sexual dysfunction. <br>

It's like a male pedophile who persues only female children calling himself heterosexual. He's not. He's a fucking pedophile. Or a male pedophile who persues only male children. Again, he's not gay...he's a fucking pedophile.<br>

No one has any right to make judgements on what is right/wrong for another person, so long as the decisions the other person is making do not interfere with that person.<br>
<br>
Humans are by far in the minority of the animal kingdom in that we actually enjoy sex (potentially anyway) and do it as something other than a means of reproducing at specific times of the year. Bonobo monkeys are the only other species I'm aware of using sexual relations in a human like manner. Hyenas maybe, since the females have a mock penis, and engage in mock sexual relations with each other (PBS is wonderful, no?) =-p<br>
<br>
anyway, the real point is: if you enjoy it, and you can do it consensually with another person, vegetable, animal, or mineral, and it doesn't hurt someone else, then do it if you want to. <p><br>

<br>
Issue: How do animals consent to having sexual relations with humans?  They cannot speak, and one cannot always take actions as consent.<br>
<br>
My personal view of anything other than &quot;straight&quot; heterosexuality (i.e. having sexual relations with members of your species who are of the opposite gender) is this : It's a practice that technically promotes genocide.  I do not view this as a problem, since the gene pool so desperately needs a chlorine shock, but that does not make it &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.  That's for the individuals involved to decide, and last I checked, animals cannot make informed decisions. <p><center>

There's actually a number of reasons homosexuality would be benefical to a species. But that's really a discussion for another thread. <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank">

This should seriously be a no brainer. Same reason it's wrong to fuck children. Again, should be a no brainer.<br>
<br>
Primarily because you're in a position of power over someone who does not have the ability to make an informed choice. A child cannot make informed consent to sexual activities. A child may agree to have something done to them, but in reality it's an adult abusing a relationship and a position of authority. A child doesn't know better. The adult does. Which is why the wrong doing is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on the child<br>
<br>
The same standard is true for people who are physically or mentally incapacitated beyond the point of reasonable consent. Arguing that a comatose patient doesn't experience anything bad happening to them, ergo it's ok to fuck them is stupid. It's still rape in any US court. <br>
<br>
The same is true for animals.<br>
<br>
Plus it's seriously, seriously fucking sick.  <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank">

     ...or they are merely nerds who love role-playing games, spend hours chatting on the Internet……. <br>

    Skinny or fat, introverted or oddly melodramatic, they were the kids everyone picked on, the ones who found solace in fantasy books. The Fandom may be the first place they've felt welcome, yet they still fight:………….. <br>

     Before long he was living a double life: teenage boy in suburban Detroit; libidinous wolf online. He played interactive games…………..<br>
<br>
    Some furs criticize Nikon because his character is a female. &quot;They think I'm deceptive,&quot; he says. He has a hard time explaining why he is a girl.  &quot;It's just another thing that feels right,&quot; he says. &quot;To tell you the truth, I would rather be a woman in real life, but that's not going to happen. It's too money-intensive.&quot; <br>
<br>
…mmmm…was that a EQ article or a Furrie?? Lol<br>
<br>
    At least the Furries seemed to be getting out more often than the typical uber-Eqer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (and getting laid) lol<br>
  <br>
   I did have one question tho, if you have sex with a male stuffed animal, are you gay?? Come to think about it, how do you tell if the stuffed animal is male or female??<br>
<br>
  Bottom line, after reading all 9 pages, I did not see how they were hurting any one except possable them selfs.  And that passes the Macoy Test for Acceptability.
