<br>
The Misty Thicket, just outside of Rivervale – many seasons ago...<br>
<br>
A young halfling by the name of Binkee, the eldest child of the Furrytoes clan, was out with his brothers Dinkee and Winkee gathering honeycomb for that evening’s supper, trying to gather enough before the sun set.  They had wasted the day playing in the Thicket and were paying for it now.  Soon they had enough honeycomb to feed the entire clan (which was quite a feast, for halflings do love to eat well), and drew Bixie stingers for who would carry them in.  Like every other day, Binkee drew the short stinger, and was elected to carry the massive basket of honeycomb in to the house.  Binkee always wondered why he had to carry them in every night... after all, he WAS the oldest... and how did he end up drawing the short one every day?  These thoughts and more, less pleasant ones went through his head as he lifted the basket over his head.  Binkee headed towards the Rivervale gate, struggling for balance and strength, when his eyes grew wide.  The basket fell to the ground with a resounding THUMP and the honeycombs were scattered all about.  Out of the shadows came Mac Deeppockets, one of the most famous halflings in all of Rivervale.  He walked towards Binkee with a kind of interest and calm at the same time.  Mac turned his head the deputies near the entrance and nodded at them for a bit of assistance with the spill.  They smiled and quickly scattered about putting the honeycomb back into Binkee’s basket.  Mac continued in his path toward a motionless Binkee, smiling at the young halfling.<br>
“Hello, Binkee.  My name is Mac.  From your look I can see that you know who I am.”  He smiled.<br>
“I have no money to give you, sir.  I am only gathering food for my clan.”<br>
Mac laughed at Binkee.  “No, silly, I’m not here for that sort of business.”<br>
Binkee breathed a sigh of relief and snickered at Mac.  “Sorry about that, hehe.  What ARE you here for then, if I may ask?”<br>
“Binkee, the other Deeppockets and I have been watching you.  I have been waiting to give you this for a long time.  Now that you are old enough to choose a trade, we feel it would be a wise choice for you to become a Rogue of the Deeppockets.  I have been instructed by master Lendel to give you this note.  Do with it what you will, but know that upon returning it to Lendel, you will become a member of the Deeppockets clan for the rest of your life on Norrath.”<br>
Mac then looked Binkee over one more time, smiled, and handed him a rolled up note.  Binkee accepted it and nodded at Mac.<br>
“I hope to see you at the Fool’s Gold soon, Binkee.  May Bristlebane fill your world with mischief.”<br>
Mac stepped into the shadows as Binkee read over the note.  Binkee looked up and gasped to find him gone.  He then remembered that he was already late with his honeycomb, and the sun was not going to wait for him forever.  He lifted the heavy basket over his head, thanked the kind deputies for their help, and scampered off, as fast as he could, into Rivervale.<br>
<br>
That evening at dinner after having been scolded by Mother Furrytoes for being late, Binkee made no mention of his encounter with Mac.  He knew his parents would not condone his becoming a thief.  Binkee had wanted to be a Deeppocket since he first saw one in action, stealthily picking a few copper from the man in line ahead of him at the market to pay for his food.  He decided that night, as he lay in bed, that he would take the note to Lendel the next day...<br>
Binkee woke up early the next morning and scratched out a note to his parents:<br>
        “Dear Mother and Father,<br>
You will likely not see me again for a long while.  I have gone out to start my own life as a grown halfling.  I know this is sudden, but it is a decision I must make on my own, and a journey I must make on my own.  I will not tell you where I am, and will only say that I will return to Rivervale when I have made an honorable Furrytoes of myself.  Take good care of my brothers, and I will see you all when I have grown to be strong.  Be in good health, and keep your eye on Bristlebane.<br>
                                                Binkee.”<br>
<br>
He left the note on the door to his parents’ chamber, and walked straight to the Fool’s Gold, where the Deeppockets met to discuss the issues of the day.  Mac smiled when he saw Binkee enter the bar, and nodded at Binkee as he passed.  Immediately next to Mac was Lendel, head Rogue of the Deeppockets.<br>
“Hail Lendel Deeppockets,” Binkee said, in a confident tone that would only roughly conceal his apprehension.<br>
“Hello, my young friend,” Lendel replied.  “Can I help you?”<br>
Binkee handed Lendel the note.  “Mac gave this to me.  He said you would help me become a Deeppocket.”<br>
Lendel smiled at Binkee.  “Yes, Binkee.  We have been waiting for you.  I knew you would make the right decision.”  He nodded at Mac.<br>
Mac went up the stairs and returned with a folded-up tunic and a sheathed dagger.  He handed them to Lendel, who then handed them to Binkee.<br>
“This is simply some equipment to get you started on your hunting.  You have permission to sell the tunic when you get something you like more, but always keep the dagger with you.  For a Deeppocket’s best friend is his first dagger.”<br>
Binkee nodded and put on his tunic and attached the sheath to his belt.<br>
“Now, Binkee, for your first item as a Deeppocket.  I want you to go out into the thicket and hunt until you are a master at using the dagger I have given you.  Beware of the evil goblins, however, especially their leader Mooto.  They are a filthy bunch and deserve to be crushed, but you should not try this until you are much stronger, as your death would put an untimely end to your campaign as a Deeppocket.  Go now, Binkee, and report to me every so often.  I will teach you more about being a Deeppocket as you grow.”<br>
Binkee smiled at Lendel and thanked him, then scampered off to the Thicket, eager to become a strong rogue.<br>
<br>
Seasons passed, and Binkee became stronger, and one evening he encountered a goblin by the name of Gungrich in a place where normally skeletons were found.  This goblin was unlike others that Binkee had come in contact with.  This one seemed friendly to Binkee.  Until he tried to talk to it, that is.  Gungrich proceeded to attack Binkee, and with only thoughts of self-defense, he slew the unusual goblin.  Weeks later, Binkee returned to Lendel, with his latest report.  He mentioned his encounter with Gungrich, and was almost in tears after seeing the anger in the face of his elder Deeppockets.<br>
“Gungrich was a friend of the Deeppockets!  Your action is an insult to the whole of the Deeppockets clan.  What do you have to say for yourself, Binkee?”<br>
Binkee was silent, and hung his head in front of Lendel.<br>
“Binkee, your breach of my trust saddens me.  However, I do not want to have you killed for killing a friend, though you deserve it.”<br>
Binkee nodded.<br>
“I hereby exile you from Rivervale until you have proven yourself to be a loyal Deeppocket.  You will come to me when you feel you have done so, and until they are given clearance from me, no merchant, banker, or friend will do any business with you whatsoever.  You are no longer a Deeppocket until I say you are.  Am I understood?”<br>
Binkee nodded.<br>
“Then you shall leave this place at once.  Perhaps you are better suited in Freeport.  There is a brother of ours there who will continue in your teaching, but do not come to me for guidance until you feel you have proven yourself.”<br>
Binkee nodded once again, and walked out of the Fool’s Gold.  He slowly walked towards the entrance to the Thicket, looking around him, taking one last look at everything.  This is the last he would see of the home he loved for a long time...<br>
Binkee took one last look over Rivervale, and walked past the guards toward the Kithicor Forest...<br>
