<br>
They are finally out again...The Darwin Awards - an annual honor given to the person who did thegene pool the biggest service by killing oneself in the most extraordinarily stupid way.<br>
<br>
Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Cokemachine which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it.<br>
<br>
And the nominees this year are:<br>
<br>
9. A young Canadian man, searching for a way of getting drunk cheaply because he had no money with which to buy alcohol, mixed gasoline with milk. Not surprisingly, this concoction made him ill, and he vomited into the fireplace in his house.  The resulting explosion and fire burned down his house killing both him and his sister.  (Sad his sister had to go too!)<br>
<br>
8. A 34-year-old white male found dead in the basement of his home died of suffocation according to the police.  He was approximately 6'2&quot; tall and weighed 225 pounds. He was wearing a pleated skirt, white bra, black and white saddle shoes, and a woman's wig.  It appeared that he was trying to create a schoolgirl's uniform look.  He was also wearing a military gas mask that had the filter canister removed and a rubber hose attached in its place. The other end of the hose was connected to one end of a hollow wooden tube approximately 12&quot; long and 3&quot; in diameter.  The tube's other end was inserted into his rectum for reasons unknown and was the cause of his suffocation. Police found the task of explaining the circumstances of his death to his family very awkward.<br>
<br>
7. Three Brazilian men were flying in a light aircraft at low altitude when another plane approached.  It appears that they decided to moon the occupants of the other plane, but lost control of their own aircraft and crashed. They were all found dead in the wreckage with their pants around their ankles.<br>
<br>
6. A police officer in Ohio responded to a 911 call. She had no details before arriving, except that someone had reported that his father was not breathing. Upon arrival, the officer found the man face down on the couch naked. When she rolled him over to check for a pulse, and to start CPR, she noticed burn marks around his genitals. After the ambulance arrived and removed the man - who was declared dead on arrival at the hospital - the police made a closer inspection of the couch, and noticed that the man had made a hole between the cushions. Upon flipping the couch over, they discovered what had caused his death.  Apparently the man had a habit of putting his penis between the cushions, down into the hole and between two electrical sanders (with the sandpaper removed, for obvious reasons).  According to the story, after his orgasm the discharge shorted out one of the sanders, electrocuting him.<br>
<br>
5. A 27-year-old French woman lost control of her car on a highway near Marseilles and crashed into a tree, seriously injuring her passenger and killing herself. As a commonplace road accident, this would not have qualified for a Darwin nomination, were it not for the fact that the driver's attention had been distracted by her Tamagotchi key ring, which had started urgently beeping for food as she drove along. In an attempt to press the correct buttons to save the amagotchi's life, the woman lost her own.<br>
<br>
4. A 22-year-old Reston, VA man was found dead after he tried to use octopus straps to bungee off a 70 foot railroad trestle. Fairfax County police said Eric Carcia, a fast-food worker, taped a bunch of these straps together, wrapped an end around each foot, anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park, jumped and hit the pavement. Warren Carmichael, a police spokesman, said the investigators think Barcia was acting alone because his car was found nearby.  &quot;The length of the cord that he had assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the ground,&quot; Carmichael said. Police say the apparent cause of death was &quot;Major trauma.&quot;<br>
<br>
3. A man in Alabama died from rattlesnake bites. It seems that he and a friend were playing a game of catch, using the rattlesnake as a ball. The friend - no doubt a future Darwin Awards candidate - was hospitalized.<br>
<br>
2. Employees in a medium sized warehouse in west Texas noticed the smell of a gas leak. Sensibly, management evacuated the building, extinguishing all potential sources of ignition; lights, power, etc. After the building had been evacuated, two technicians from the gas company were dispatched. Upon entering the building they found they had difficulty navigating in the dark.  To their frustration, none of the lights worked. Witnesses later described the sight of one of the technicians reaching into his pocket and retrieving an object that resembled a cigarette lighter.  Upon operation of the lighter like object, the gas in the warehouse exploded sending pieces of it up to three miles away.  Nothing was found of the technicians, but the lighter was virtually untouched by the explosion.  The technician suspected of causing the blast had never been thought of  as &quot;bright&quot; by his peers.<br>
<br>
And the winner...<br>
<br>
The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene.  The lab finally figured out what it was and what had happened.  It seems that a guy had  somehow gotten hold of a JATO unit (Jet Assisted Take Off- actually a solid fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport and extra &quot;push&quot; for taking off from short airfields.  He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert and found a long and straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some  speed and fired off the JATO!  The facts as best could be determined are that the operator of the 1967 Impala hit the JATO ignition at a distance of approximately 3.0 miles from the crash site. This was established by the prominent scorched and melted asphalt at that location. The JATO, if operating properly, would have reached maximum thrust within five seconds, causing the Impala to reach speeds well in excess of 350 mph and continuing at full power for an additional 20-25 seconds. The driver, soon to be pilot, most likely would have experienced G-forces usually reserved for dogfighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners, causing him to become insignificant for the remainder of the event. However, the automobile remained on the straight highway for about 2.5 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied and completely melted the brakes, blowing the tires and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface, then becoming airborne for an additional 1.4 miles and impacting the cliff face at a height of 125 feet leaving a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver's remains were not recoverable, however, small fragments of bone, teeth and hair were extracted from the crater and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel. Epilogue: It has been calculated that this moron reached Mach 1, attaining a ground speed of approximately 720 mph.   <p><center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/kevinschic/Dhar3_frosty.txt"><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/trueallegiance"><font face=verdana><b>True Allegiance</b></font></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubeanre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beanre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/29/02 4:00:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This Year's Darwin Awards</span><hr size=1> The winner did the whole jato thing about 3-4 years ago, odd that it is this years winner, anyway, there are some real sickos out there it looks like <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utoxxthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Toxx The Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/29/02 4:32:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=578.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This Year's Darwin Awards</span><hr size=1> Sickos?!<br>

<br>
No, they haven't.  In the book (and most likely the site), there is a specific section (or a specific label for certain classics) just for urban myths.  So, the Darwin Awards book, and site includes both the myths and verified stories.<br>

A sizable number of men who die of autoerotic asphyxiation are found wearing women's clothes of one sort or another -- usually underwear.  How do I know this?  I read Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels.<br>
