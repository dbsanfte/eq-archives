Fucking classic. Im kind of upset that i only got one line, though. This is why i love this game. We can make fun of people and actually relate. Most everything there is true (although extremely exaggerated in some cases). Its just amazing how we see one another in this virtual world. The things said about each of us can are so basic and overly obvious. Oh well, Im going to be happy from now on as far as EQ is concerned. Ill continue to flame people that act moronic, but its all just fun. I think im done rambling now. Thank you, chai, for making me take a step back.<br>

NOTE: Some shriners are very funny. Some are not. Some (ei. wauke and verdunae) are very bad pullers. Some are not. I encourage you all to judge these people individually, and above all, know that Ragnarok is an ass.<br>
