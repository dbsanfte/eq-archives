Sweat poured down her head as her heart raced at a blinding speed. Each second seemed to slow to a crawl as she saw her life fly by in an instant. Screams of slain enemies and ghost of fallen comrades haunted her mind in this time of agony. <br>
  &quot;Lady Warbreed, it will be over soon,&quot; Aurra said as she held her hand tightly with a grip any man would kill for. Her eyes red with tears and pain Warbreed looked upon Aurra with her most evil grin.<br>
  Another contraction hit, and her scream engulfed the castle once more, waking any inhabitant from there deep slumber. Anadaar rushed into the room with elegant robes waving in his wake, but covering his eyes as he entered the room from embarament. Warbreed pounded on the edge of the bed till you could here the bones crackle and snap under the stress, and each time her hand crashed on the rails, Anadaar grimaced and looked away.<br>
  &quot;Damnit woman stop that,&quot; Anadaar belowed at Warbreed in disgust. &quot;I can ease the pain but you must calm yourself a bit so that i might finish the spell.&quot;<br>
  &quot;You will not take it away from me!&quot; Warbreed screamed at the top of her voice. &quot;The pain is mine and mine alone. You dare take it away from ame and I will gut you where you stand.&quot;<br>
   Anadaar stood silent withh surprise and fear for his life. Never had he seen Warbreed in such pain, in all the battles, challenges and duels, never had one person endured more. Granted he never saw a Tier'dal woman give birth before but this was more than he could bare. Anadaar stormed out of the robe as he gathered hes silken robe edges from the floor.<br>
  &quot;Weak bastard!&quot; She screamed as he tossed a cup at door.<br>
  &quot;Weak me may be but he is right war,&quot; Aurra said calmly as ever.&quot;You are making this worse not better. The child will be born healthy and strong but you are going to kill yourself.&quot;<br>
  The words seemed to roll off in Warbreeds mind and she winced again from another contraction. Then the pain subsided a little and she thought back through her past. The days she fought of Lady Vox, seeing the faceless god, conquering the weak as she passed and teaching the strong. She saw her lover, a erudite necromancer that no one knew of, and saw how he died at the hands of Tier'dal forces in Kithicor. She saw her race turn against her, and how they banished her powers from her. She saw how her commrades had joined her in a quest to regain her former glory and she saaw how the quest failed. All that she ever knew was gone, all that she ever hoped was destroyed, and all that she ever loved had been ripped away.<br>
   Aurra looked deeply at her casting a small spell of life to keep Warbreed awake, each pulse of the spell gave a bit to warb from herself. The process was slow but now both friends were weakening.<br>
  Soon another hour passed and a strong dark elf walked in the door follwed by a cleric. Ezra wore a deep red robe and began to whisper strange words of power, while Nimal began to conjure his dark forces. Each friend gave themselves to save her from this painful expirence but soon thier power faded.<br>
  Hot tears streamed from Warbreed's eyes and she turned to her friends and smiled. <br>
  &quot;My child shall live even if I will not,&quot; she said softly. Then she bagan to mummble words of a dark spell. Shadows danced about the room as candles flickered from an unfelt wind. Moans of torture and screams of pain from everywhere engulfed the room. Warbreed's eyes blazed with a black flame and she smiled once again.<br>
  &quot;With Innorruk's power, I now become hate, anger and blood. With this I give to my child. I now become one with hate misery and agony. I shall take what you have given me this night and bear witness to the end. But my end shall be the begining of my child. Let Innoruuk's will be done.&quot;<br>
  Warbreeds eyes hollowed out and slowy disentergrated on the bad. Piece by Piece she vanished into the shadows. The occupants of the room felt a tugg at there power as though they were being sucked into an infinite void.<br>
  &quot;Get out of here now,&quot; Anadaar shouted from outside of the door. &quot;I dont know what she did but it canot be good.&quot;<br>
  Everyone bolted out the room and Anadaar began a spell of rune protection on the room.<br>
  Several hours pass and the screams died out at last but the strange silence that was left was worse. Anadaar cancled the spell and they all walked in together. Not knowing what to expect each member was ready for action but when the door was oppened all they saw was a silent baby sleeping in a bed of ashes. <br>
  The baby boy had the body of a Erudite but was completely hairless and his eyes where pupiles. He glowed with a strange arua that could be felt not only seen.<br>
  &quot;By Innoruuk what is this,&quot; Ezra asked.<br>
  &quot;It is my will,&quot; said a shadowed siggure from a darkened corner. &quot;My will and mine alone. You have done well my children but now this child shall be my sword, my shield and my power against those who oppose me.&quot;<br>
   The shadow snaked to the bed and engulfed the child, then vanished.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=119.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=78.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=117.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=117.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
