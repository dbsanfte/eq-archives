I'm agnostic.. there's more proof to evidence aliens than there is to evidence God (oh btw, read Zechariah Sitchin's <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>The 12th Planet</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> - it's about the original scriptures (Hebrew) being re-translated and combined with other knowledge to reach the conclusion that the scripture was written as a story about aliens.. no proof really, but very interesting and logically drawn). If I was forced to pick one or the other side of the spectrum, I would pick atheist. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=50436"><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triff01.jpg" alt="Click for my EQCastersrealm profile" align="left" border=0></a><img src="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/duel.gif" alt="rofl..

I am proud of my faith and have absolutely NO doubt.  I don't really feel that a Bulletin Board thread is a place for this topic, it is better handled in a person to person talk.  But I would like to point out a couple of things to those who ask &quot;How could God allow this&quot;<br>
<br>
In God's word, in the very beginning, the story of Adam and Eve, 2 of their sons were named Cain and Able.  Able pleased God but Cain disappointed God, so Cain Murdered Able.  Why didn't God save Able, if Able so pleased God?  Because although life is precious, it is NOTHING compared to ETERNITY and Able pleased God.  Besides that, who are we that we can ask God &quot;Why&quot; about anything.<br>
<br>
Another well known story, God destroyed the earth with a flood, saving only Noah and his family, and some animals.  Why?  God's Word said it was because the people on the earth has turned their backs on God and worshipped &quot;false&quot; gods.  There are even references in the Bible that God will destroy a &quot;pagan&quot; people with &quot;Fire from the Sky&quot;.<br>
<br>
To answer a couple of posters, God NEVER asks for money, and Jesus said that God does not need your money, the God &quot;owns the cattle of a thousand hills&quot;.  God taught to give so that the temple could be built, the bills paid (modern day would be utilities, upkeep, etc...)  and that the worker's in the temple could receive a salary.  For those preacher's today that demand so much money, misuse the money, etc..., they will answer to God.  The GIVER of the money, if done with a good heart, will receive blessings.<br>
<br>
For those that believe in evolution, even Darwin became a strong, God believing Christian, when he came to the realization that his own theories were extremely inadequate in explaining much about man's existance.  Even if evolution does have some validity, it never explains where &quot;It All Started&quot;.  Even science says you can't get &quot;something from nothing&quot; AND &quot;matter cannot have always existed&quot;, it had to be CREATED at some time.<br>
<br>
Our country was founded upon TWO principles - FREEDOM and FAITH.  In all our important &quot;Founding Documents&quot;, you find numerous references to God.  Our coins and bills say &quot;In God We Trust&quot;.  Our pledge of Allegiance says &quot;...one nation, UNDER GOD....&quot;.  One of our more treasured songs is &quot;God Bless America&quot;.  Every session of Congress opens with prayer.  For all of you who do not believe in God, who are either Agnostic or Atheist, our country gives you the right to feel that way, and for that reason, I respect your stance.  But on the other hand, my soul cries for you and for the future of America.  It cries for you, because eternity is a long time to spend 'without the presence of God'.  It cries for our country because we will FALL if we keep turning away from God.  For those that study history, great empires fell and if you study them closely, you will see their fall from power was parallel to their falling away from faith.<br>
<br>
I will leave with this, an answer from God to Solomon, the king of Israel:<br>
&quot;I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple....  When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people, if MY PEOPLE, who are called by MY name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will HEAL THEIR LAND.  Now My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered.......<br>
II Chronicles 7:12-15<br>
<br>
I am reminded of something an Army Chaplin said during WWII, &quot;I have never seen an atheist in a foxhole&quot;<br>
<br>
YES, I BELIEVE IN GOD<br>

Can you read?  The original question was &quot;personal&quot;, &quot;Do you believe in god?&quot;.  I answered and gave my reasons.  Did I ever say you or anyone else has to believe the same was as me?  I said I am sad for those that don't, BUT, that is part of my belief, my love and caring for other people.  I even said I respect those who believe differently.  Did I hit a little too close to home for you, for you to attack my post?<br>

Here is my opinion. First if you are going to pick a side to argue on please have some fact to base your opinions on. With out fact your opinions become that of a moron. Now do you really want to look like a moron. Next I don't care what you believe in and you probably really don't care about what I believe in. Next, if any proof existed that God existed well then we would not be having this discussion. My opinion on the whole God thing, Gurglespit Fruggybasher has my views exactly. ( His post was on the 1st page. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) My views go alot further than this but most people would not be able to understand some of the consepts that I have come up with. Some would but I don't feel like getting into the fact that there is not God and there is, because everybody is there own god. Now with what I have researched to defend my views from what I call the &quot;Historically Stupid&quot; I could keep some would be believers in a long drawn out discussion on the topic for hours on end.<br>
<br>
In some sence I get a pleasure out of arguing some thing that can be proven by science and can't ever be proven by religon. I also have to be concious of the fact that I might be bashing people when I am not, I am just in it for the discussion.<br>
<br>
Other than that I can defend this following statement for as long as some one can argue the opposite for. Trust me its fun.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can prove God does not exist. Prove that he does.&quot;<br>
<br>
One more for the road. <br>
<br>
&quot;Faith is based on your level of intellegence.&quot; You can take that where you want too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Um, no. You can't &quot;prove&quot; a negative. The best you can do is assert a negative and then marshall out cogent arguments or empirical evidence to support your assertion. He who affirms must demonstrate the truth of the affirmation. I am an atheist because I find no good reasons to hold belief in a diety. As an atheist I do not even attempt to defend the statement &quot;There is no god&quot;. I only respond to those who affirm and demonstrate why their assertions fail. Atheism, in its weakest form, is simply the failure to believe.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 303<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/6/01 4:37:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=232>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/nettle/eq/maeri/maeri.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you believe in god?</span><hr size=1> I don't think it's possible to prove God doesn't exist (for most reasonable definitions of God).

&quot;But negative statements are certainly provable. &quot;<br>
<br>
There is a vast difference between mathmatical formulae and existential statements. 2+2=4 is not an existential statement where as &quot;X exists&quot; is. Saying that &quot;X doesn't exist&quot; is an empirical statement. I don't think one can provide a negative existential statement that is meanigful unless two conditions are met first. 1) The statement is not empirical; 2) The statement is analytically true. The statement &quot;God does not exist.&quot; May be empirical, but unless one covers every corner of the universe it can't be known whether the statement is true. That because of the proposed nature of God. 2 fails in my opinion since there are no successful ontological arguments for the existence of God that demonstrate the necessity of a true affirmative statement for the existence of god.<br>

&quot;But Muzaak, that form of atheism is called &quot;agnosticism.&quot;&quot;<br>

No, Agnosticism is the idea that one can't have knowledge of God's existence so can neither affirm or deny that god exists. I know there are no instances of various concepts of god, because they are absurd logically. For instance, the concept of a god that is supremely good, all knowing, and all powerful leads to many logical contradictions. I know such a concept can't have any instances in the world just as I know there is no such thing as a &quot;round-square&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
