That right there says that i cant stop him from taking a few spawns cause its the RULES!!!! Yes it is dishonorable but you have to follow them like you have to follow any rules or laws in RL otherwise you can or will get in trouble.

To me, kill stealing, training, and using Verant's &quot;rules&quot; to force your way into another person's camp all accomplishes the same thing.  It ruins the fun of others.  You said it yourself... he is kill stealing AND dishonorable.  You seem to be shitlisting him for being dishonorable just as much as for allegedly stealing spawns from you.  That's why I brought it to attention.  When it happened to someone else, you said (in essence) &quot;it stinks, but deal with it because Verant made the rules this way.&quot;  However, when it happens to you, you come to the shitlist and put the person's name here for the whole server to see.

<br>
The Lanys boards are breeding grounds for people being able to dissect and pick apart posts you made. They can be twisted around and then to some horror they are all the sudden against you.<br>
<br>
I disregard all the details because they can really construe the apparent evidence.<br>
<br>
In my opinion only, I think we all have a civil duty to strive to remain honorable at all times. We all play in an environment where we constantly have to deal with numerous amounts of people. The only way to compete against endless rage and vendictiveness is to try your utmost best to remain honorable.<br>
<br>
In a situation regarding someone who strives to remain honorable they would have reacted in certain ways.<br>
In this situation, a man walked into someone elses camp.<br>
Now, it is true that he DID ask to share the spawns.<br>
As the current campers they decided that it would be a hindrance to them to have someone else killing their spawns<br>
and asked him to please find another place to camp.<br>
<br>
An honorable person in this position, would have walked away and said &quot;Ok np, good luck&quot;<br>
<br>
Kanos did not.<br>
<br>
It is apparent he disregarded the current campers' feelings and thoughts on the situation and forced him to share.<br>
While it may be in the rules...it is not something a truly honorable person would do. I know I wouldn't and I could list a few people from this forum right here that would not either.<br>
<br>
That was the first dishonorable deed this guy committed and it is the only thing that needs to be said. All other information is just aimed at construing the conversation.<br>

<br>
I don't think anyone is suggesting that what Kanos did is not dishonorable.  However, if you saw the quote on this page that Neesha referred to... that was a quote made by Celina in regards to the Diea shitlisting.  Just by taking her words at face value, she is implying that because Verant made the PnP rules (meaning, you have to share a camp if someone requests it), that Diea has no business being on the shitlist.  Funny, though, that she shitlisted a different person for doing the same exact thing.  Basically, if Diea shouldn't be shitlisted for requesting that a camp be shared, why should Kanos?<br>
<br>
I fully agree that Kanos belongs here.  However, Neesha was stating that it's hypocritical of Celina to assume that someone else's shitlisting has no merit, while hers (which was built upon the same standards) has more right to be here. <p><IMG SRC="http://home.swbell.net/sdspies/images/mustelasig.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="212" alt="Image courtesy The Ferret Company http://www.ferretcompany.com/"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucelinaheartworthy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CelinaHeartworthy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/30/01 5:32:19 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/tattooine/tolkien/120/ani47.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> You people dont know shit about what i was trying to say... i never said that Diea shouldn't have been shitlist i just was stating that her reasons of her actions could have been caused on the facts that she wasnt able to get the shared part of the camp.<br>
<br>
Not ONCE in my post did i say she shouldnt have been shitlist, in fact i was sorry for the person it happened to.  Now from the lack of info in her post she led people to believe she wasnt sharing the camp at all.  Her ignoring her was a form of saying No as i read it.<br>
<br>
I was just simply stating that with the PnP rule, you need to share a camp.  So there is no Irony at all in my posts.  Now Kanos himself demanded the camp after the fact for him wanting to take spawns... That right there was the dishonorable actions.<br>
<br>
Diea herself asked to share and got ignored.  Telling her the answer was NO.  I was just simply stating to Limper that he should have shared the camp, Not that I approve of the people who inforce it.<br>
<br>
Limper then posted again on his post saying that she was able to get spawns that not all were killed. That right there just filled in all the blanks to what i was posting about.<br>

Nice way to look at it. Not wanting to share and keep all to yourself is Greed.

I rather work a little longer and have the company and not have people fighting over a game. As for the monk and the cleric I don't have much on that because they both say different things and never know which is telling the truth. I am just saying yeah Verant shouldn't make us share but we should wan't to share because that is a value we should of grown up with. Also I don't demand people to share, if a place is full I look for some place not full or empty usually, unless I get offered to join somebody elsewhere. Of course not being greedy is being polite and not sure why I am telling that on any board that has F**K this and S**T that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrakceles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>trakceles </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bored un-uber boober</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/1/01 4:04:10 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.everlore.com/gimages/c_warrior.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> Tyral, you have got to be the biggest fuckin moron on Lanys, congratulations! <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20633>Trakceles Mcmarrin</a>

<br>
The realms of Eversmack are HUGE...there are tons of zones...and you share a single spawn that you can solo OMFG either your parents let you watch way to much strawbarie shortcakes as a child or you need to get a back bone.<br>
<br>
We are talking about camps that are regular camps...like BnB, Nobles, NGE, Crypt, Disco1, Disco2, DHALL, etc etc etc etc etc....<br>
<br>
For someone who put the time in to get a group or put together people that can handle a section or area of the game to be pushed aside cause a fucking monk wants to get exp and is too lazy to find there own damn place to get it is rediculous...This is something that constantly frustrates me.  Players in game set up areas...shit Gtath was the person that invented Dhall as a camp...they are commonly understood areas of exp.  This solb incident is just one of the millions of incidents that have occured because its soo damn easy for monks to solo in solb, but there is no camp that they can take entirely solo...<br>

<br>
The mob was hitting another person, per se he was aggro on someone else, therefore taking that mob is Kill Stealing, unless your asked to do so, which he wasn't.<br>
<br>
Where is the debate? Where is the doubt?<br>
<br>
He is here for Kill Stealing, hopefully he learns a lesson and does not take other peoples mobs without asking.<br>
<br>
Personally I have been guilty of kill stealing on several occasions, usually when I see someone with more then one mob on them, 90% of the time the person will say thanks, 1 in 10 they will say, damn I was killing that, at which time I will apologise and say I thought they were in trouble, and be on my merry way.<br>
<br>
He didn't do that did he Neesha, he instead threw accusations about Kill stealing back, the obvious behaviour of someone on the defensive, why not just apologise and say it will not happen again?<br>
<br>
We all know why, and thats why he is here. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=10584">Saibho's Profile</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujaysonn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaysonn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/2/01 2:11:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KSing and dishonorable monk Kanos</span><hr size=1> You can be a damn author and have the perfect paragraph and someone can still pick it apart and twist it...

Gonna post a few lines.<br>
<br>
First of all, I do belong on a shitlist. It aint that bad either.<br>
<br>
Second, what happend sucks, not the first time, not the last, just happend to meet someone who lives in front of the game and has to take it out of the game, post on boards and act like it's important.<br>
<br>
Third, Sol B is chaotic, shit happens, my fault, your fault, his fault, her fault, their fault, always someones fault, if you live through it however, it's gonna be alright.<br>
<br>
Fourth, Oh no! i'm dishonorable in a few more peoples eyes than I was yesterday! oh me oh my, should I quit? Get real.<br>
<br>
And lastly, Basically, all this tells me is, I might end up getting a few less groups than usuall, or even a few more groups than normal, it absolutly accomplishes nothing, teaches us nothing and never will. It's turned out to be 39 posts of comedy to me, and no matter which way you slice it, it's not important.<br>
<br>
Enjoy luclin with your free time instead of posting fuckwit flames and complaints. <br>

If you had been concerned with what you should have done before today, you wouldn't ever have been here.<br>
<br>
Personally, this last post alone, I think he made his point that he's someone &quot;to watch out for&quot; /shrugs<br>
