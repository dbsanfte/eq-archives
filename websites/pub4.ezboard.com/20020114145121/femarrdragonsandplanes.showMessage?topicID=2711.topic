<br>
      First let me make this statement, when it comes to auctions in real life I do have a lot of experience.  In my past I have worked for years in the auction field and have seen behind the scenes of various types of auctions.  Mostly antiques and general merchandise, those seem to be the best analogy for Everquest auctions.  Regular stuff (general merchandise) you can find every day in the market = ssoy and fbss like things.  Harder to find stuff (Antiques) CoF and Velious Quest gems.   Some of you may disagree with me lumping gems with the CoF but I will hopefully craft a argument for them.  <br>
<br>
       Ok on to auction etiquette.   First clearly state what you are selling.  If you want to get the most money for something you are selling, which is one of two main reasons to sell something via auction then write a nice description.   I know that a Cloak of Flames is a CoF and a its a back worn Haste item.  I dont know the Haste % but if I was selling it I &quot;would know&quot; and I would post it.  Think of it this way.  If your bid increments are 500pp and you get one more bid because of extra information that someone might not be aware of, that extra 3 minutes you spent typing or researching is far better then the money you on average make in 3 minutes of looting monsters. <br>
       The other main reason to sell something in auction is to secure a buyer and get the item in a certain amount of time.  There is no reason that these cant be achieved with this online auction format that these boards cater to.  So to play into that, make sure you have a clear idea when you want to sell the stuff by and state it to everyone bidding.  Clear means date/time/time zone.  <br>
  <br>
       Now the tricky part.   Reserves and Silent bids.  In the auction business after working behind the scenes I can quickly spot tricks used by other auction houses.  These are legal methods of securing a minimum price for the item.  Say I am selling something that the seller paid 1000pp for because he thought it was worth more.  He auctions it, knowing anything over 1000pp is a good sale, even though he hopes it will bring 5000pp.  There is nothing wrong with NOT selling it for less then 1000pp.  In a real life auction someone in the crowd might bid 500pp (make leap of faith to a real life auction house accepting pp as payment)  The auctionere would say we have a bid for 600pp.  Then someone in the audience might go to 700pp and it keeps the auction going.  This is only legal when its done by the auction house to secure a minimum. (It is illegal when the sellers friend shows up and starts tossing bids around to push the price up for an item, knowing if he gets stuck with it he doesnt really have to pay for it.  I have seen people tossed out of auctions and the police called for that) If no one goes over 1000pp then the item is simply sold to some number not actually seated in the gallery.  There are bids left by people who dont want to sit at the auction until the item is auctioned, bids from the internet, telephone and various other legit bids that come in that way.  Those reserved bids are mixed in with those and the average person doesnt know the difference.  In Everquest board posting those would be the In Game Bids.  If you have an In Game Bid, log off if you can or when you can and post it on your auction post.  The more information the buyers have the better you will do selling.  Assuming you arent deceiving anyone.  <br>
         <br>
          Terms make sure you state your terms up front.  If someone says I will sell a ASDF and someone says i will trade you a HJKL and 6000pp.  Then as the buyer if you have interest in the HJKL then post that that bid is accepted and can be beaten by a bid of 13000pp.  Nothing worse then trying to bid on something only to have no idea what you have to bid to beat a current winning bid.<br>
*********<br>
 If you dont want any trades post no trades, but dont get mad if someone tries to post a trade anyway, just ignore it or kindly state you have no interest in trades.<br>
*********<br>
You are trying to sell something, you dont have to be a putz at the same time.   <br>
<br>
      Now something about item value (I told you velious quest gems are comming back into this)  A item at auction has a value equal to whatever someone is willing to pay for it or what value is to the seller whichever is higher.   I know that lots of people disagree with this but its true, honest. <br>
       If the seller thinks something is worth 5000pp and the highest bidder thinks its worth 6000pp and it sells for 6000pp at that moment the item is worth 6000pp that can change in 25 minutes and that person could go to EC and sell if for 10000pp but at that moment at that place(space) the item is worth the selling amount.  Now if the highest bid is 4000pp the dealer/seller decides to not to sell because he/she didn't get the 5000pp it is still basically worth 5000pp because in that time and space you need to pay 5000pp to get the item.  Supply and demand can mess this up because there are other spaces to buy an item.  If you want to trade on that space(in game, guild board, other EQ board, etc. then go there and buy it, dont crucify the seller, just dont buy it and move on, dont start calling the person an idiot or a moron or high or a tool.  If you dont like the person and you want to just mess up their auction then you are the idiot, moron, or tool not them.  It is ok to say that it is available in another place and the price is not correct, but its an auction. As a buyer your opinion only matters to the seller if you are the highest bidder.  So get over yourself.  Velious gems are a perfect example of this.  You could have someone selling a xyz gem for 400pp and they have 10 of them, another person might have 1 of them and wants 600pp for it.  The gem can only be bought for 400pp for the first 10 till you have to deal with Mr 600pp.  I personally didnt need any quest gems at all until one day when I won an armor drop then another buyer for that gem existed, so suddenly 3 xyz gems are needed where there werent before.  When the gems are turned in for the armour then they are out of the game.  Not like a CoF where it can be resold later but gone.  The inventory of those gems changes constantly as does the price, or at least it can.   So auction it,  and if you think its worth 400pp say I am auctioning 1 xyz gem.  I want to get at least 400pp for it and then let someone open up at 400pp and you are on your way.  If it doesnt sell then just try to sell it again at another time when market conditions are more favorable.  Say after a big pick up raid in Kael.  <br>
       Now here is where the trouble comes in.  I just saw someone trying to sell something (CoF) and someone bid 80k.  Well whats wrong with that.  The person didnt state he had a starting price.  So its a fine bid. If i had 100k to bid on a CoF and I see 80k I jump right in with 85k or 90k and as a buyer I am hooked.  I see that I have a chance to get this item cheap.  A person in the bidding will almost always bid to their maximum on an item where as a person watching the bidding may not always jump in.  A good low opening bid is great for an auction.  If you take it as an insult then you are fool not the person who bid it.<br>
<br>
Example:  I was at an auction (real life)where there was a glass vase for sale.  To the auction house and most of the people in the gallery the item was a 500-1000 dollar vase(USD for you that dont know where I live) .  The auctioner asked for $1000 and got no bids, then asked for $500 and got a bid.  Asked for $600 and got a bid then  back to the first guy for $700 then to the second guy for $800.  Well this went on for a long time.  Now everyone thought the vase was worth $500-$1000 but on that day someone thought that vase was worth $11000.  <br>
<br>
       Now on to wrapping up.  The computer I play EQ on is broken at the moment, hence my time to type and type and type some more.  Second if you wish to make fun of my spelling, well I will tell you right here that I know I am a bad speller.  If you dont like me or my character personally then start a new thread.  If you dont like my lack of paragraphs then dont read it. **** If you dont like my points or have something to add then post below.****  Buying and selling things in EQ are not fun for me.  I hate it, I hate EC and all of that.  I tried to buy something from someone and he told me to look for him tomorrow.  So I did and I didnt want to mess up spelling his name so i did /who xxx all and saw all the names of people with the same 3 starting letters of his name.  I think I was raiding at the time so for many hours i kept seeing him not online and another person with the same starting letters online in EC, he happened to be in my guild so I knew he was online and selling.  He was in EC selling for like 4-5 hours straight.  That is fun for people, that is not fun for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  So if you want to sell stuff and make money to buy more stuff there is a ton of ways to do it, but for those of us who wish to buy in auction as a seller and a buyer just be smart and friendly and it will be a lot less frustrating for those who want to just get our item or our money and get out and go kill some monsters.<br>

If you want to get the most money for something you are selling, which is one of two main reasons to sell something via auction then write a nice description.   I know that a Cloak of Flames is a CoF and a its a back worn Haste item.  I dont know the Haste % but if I was selling it I &quot;would know&quot; and I would post it.  Think of it this way.  If your bid increments are 500pp and you get one more bid because of extra information that someone might not be aware of, that extra 3 minutes you spent typing or researching is far better then the money you on average make in 3 minutes of looting monsters. <br>
<br>

This is only legal when its done by the auction house to secure a minimum. (It is illegal when the sellers friend shows up and starts tossing bids around to push the price up for an item, knowing if he gets stuck with it he doesnt really have to pay for it.  I have seen people tossed out of auctions and the police called for that) If no one goes over 1000pp then the item is simply sold to some number not actually seated in the gallery.  There are bids left by people who dont want to sit at the auction until the item is auctioned, bids from the internet, telephone and various other legit bids that come in that way.  Those reserved bids are mixed in with those and the average person doesnt know the difference.<br>
<br>
        In Everquest board posting those would be the In Game Bids.  If you have an In Game Bid, log off if you can or when you can and post it on your auction post.  The more information the buyers have the better you will do selling.  Assuming you arent deceiving anyone.  <br>

       Now here is where the trouble comes in.  I just saw someone trying to sell something (CoF) and someone bid 80k.  Well whats wrong with that.  The person didnt state he had a starting price.  So its a fine bid. If i had 100k to bid on a CoF and I see 80k I jump right in with 85k or 90k and as a buyer I am hooked.  I see that I have a chance to get this item cheap.  A person in the bidding will almost always bid to their maximum on an item where as a person watching the bidding may not always jump in.  A good low opening bid is great for an auction.  If you take it as an insult then you are fool not the person who bid it.<br>
<br>
Example:  I was at an auction (real life)where there was a glass vase for sale.  To the auction house and most of the people in the gallery the item was a 500-1000 dollar vase(USD for you that dont know where I live) .  The auctioner asked for $1000 and got no bids, then asked for $500 and got a bid.  Asked for $600 and got a bid then  back to the first guy for $700 then to the second guy for $800.  Well this went on for a long time.  Now everyone thought the vase was worth $500-$1000 but on that day someone thought that vase was worth $11000.  <br>
<br>
       Now on to wrapping up.  The computer I play EQ on is broken at the moment, hence my time to type and type and type some more.  Second if you wish to make fun of my spelling, well I will tell you right here that I know I am a bad speller.  If you dont like me or my character personally then start a new thread.  If you dont like my lack of paragraphs then dont read it. **** If you dont like my points or have something to add then post below.****  Buying and selling things in EQ are not fun for me.  I hate it, I hate EC and all of that.  I tried to buy something from someone and he told me to look for him tomorrow.  So I did and I didnt want to mess up spelling his name so i did /who xxx all and saw all the names of people with the same 3 starting letters of his name.  I think I was raiding at the time so for many hours i kept seeing him not online and another person with the same starting letters online in EC, he happened to be in my guild so I knew he was online and selling.  He was in EC selling for like 4-5 hours straight.  That is fun for people, that is not fun for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
      So if you want to sell stuff and make money to buy more stuff there is a ton of ways to do it, but for those of us who wish to buy in auction as a seller and a buyer just be smart and friendly and it will be a lot less frustrating for those who want to just get our item or our money and get out and go kill some monsters.<br>
<br>

Thank you for reading if any of you made it this far,<br>

Didn't know you were into the auction scene! I have attended many dot.com auctions buying equipment for my former employer.<br>
<br>
My Auction philosophy was thus:<br>
<br>
That is worth 'X' amount to me. I will bid up to 'X' amount then give up.<br>
<br>
Some folks just go a little crazy. I saw an IBM Intellistation (600MHz minitower) go gor $4500. Why? I still don't know.<br>
<br>
I just keep bidding my 'X' amount, and eventually find a seller.<br>

People remember stuff like that. Many of the EC &quot;whores&quot; (I am using the term lightly, as a result of a different thread) have become flat out rude. If you see item ABC selling for only 5kpp when it normally sells at 10k, and you then buy it from the person STRICTLY to re-sell it and make profit; it is nice to wait until that person logs, or leaves the zone. It will make the richest of people feel &quot;ripped off&quot; if you re-auction it as soon as you get it. People will remember something like that, and be cautious to even to business with you anymore, because you might have some inside &quot;pricing&quot; info, or you might be trying to jack up the price.<br>

It was one of the most frustrating nights of all my time in Ebay Commons.  As a Tailor and Baker, I've spent lots of time there selling my wares.  But last night was awful.<br>
<br>
First, I kept getting people how much I was asking for one of the items I was looking to purchase.  I clearly started the line with WTB at first, and then switched to BUYING, but still kept getting tells from random_doormat_01.  What the hell is up with that?  Sure it was busy, but it's not that hard to see the line WTB or BUYING.  It was very annoying.<br>
<br>
Second,  the spam was ridiculous.  I turned all chat off except for /auc, and was still getting folks posting and reposting their auctions every 15-20 seconds.  One of the losers had a two line post that was on my screen three times at once, resulting in his one /auction being a third of my chat screen.  Another idiot kept posting his PC on ry-gorr arms every 20 seconds for five minutes.  He just didn't catch a clue when no one responded that no one either knew or cared.  He finally slowed down, but he still kept up the PC for 20 minutes.  It was hysterical seeing someone make a fool of themselves like that.<br>
<br>
Third, there's the stuff that Dwarkarn is ranting about in his thread (rightly so) and others have mentioned.  If I state in the /auc [PLAT ONLY], don't ask me to trade you for random_junk_01.  Further, if your price is firm, say so.  Everyone else haggles on the price, so unless you state otherwise, it is going to be assumed that you will too.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you don't post a price in what you are selling, and the prospective buyer asks you how much, provide a price.  When you say &quot;Make offer,&quot; what you really mean is that &quot;I'm going to try and take advantage of you if you don't know what the item is really worth.&quot;  You will never hear from me again on the sale, as you've confirmed yourself as a scammer, although a mostly benign one.<br>
<br>
What really chaps my hide the most, is an item one of my alts was looking for was finally offered for sale by Tumyetoe, and I was compelled to buy it.  Probably what made me so grumpy last night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufierios.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fierios</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/3/01 12:01:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Auctions</span><hr size=1> The whole &quot;make offers&quot; deal could get controversial. There are those items, where there is an un sure value of it. e.g. anything after 60k doesn't really have a price set in stone. You can run a PC, and you'll end up getting a large range. I get pissed, when I say &quot;/auc WTS Item ABC, Make offers&quot; And I get tells &quot;Oooh, that's nice, how much?&quot; <br>
&quot;Make an offer&quot; <br>
&quot; nm &quot;<br>
<br>
Well, the auction CLEARLY says, make offers. I do not want to set my price in stone for this item, I have the right not to. It isn't really a ploy on the sellers part. If you are unsure of the value, and you say &quot;make offers&quot; and you get one offer for 30k, one for 35k and another for 25k. You are going to end up picking up the value of the item.<br>

<br>
I'm talking about the sales of things like the White Wolf Hide Cloak I bought off Tumyeto last night.  He didn't post a price, and asked him how much he said to make an offer.  Unfortunately I really wanted the cloak and hadn't seen anyone else offer one in a couple of hours in Ebay Commons.  I saw it on EQPrices for 1200, so figured that 800 was about right.  He took the offer.  [Anyone know if I was rooked?]<br>
<br>
It's that kind of MAKE OFFER nonsense that usually pisses me off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udunkk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunkk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/3/01 4:22:43 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/p_duncan/JB.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Auctions</span><hr size=1> When it comes to the EC scene, I'll take helius' side...

You should have seen some of the crapola that Aut's auction place sold to the local yokels - tables and tables of it. Hmm, come to think of it, a good half of it ended up in the living room/kitchen/yard of the house we were renting at the time...<br>
<br>
The other half, we burned for heat.<br>

I don't believe you got rooked on the cloak, 800 is around the normal selling price currently (pre SoL).<br>
