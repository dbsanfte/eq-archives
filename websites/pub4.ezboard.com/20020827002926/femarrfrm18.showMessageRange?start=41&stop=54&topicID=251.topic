<br>
I don't believe Bush is being communist or anything of the like, but if you step back and pick at the article (and remove biased remarks) that what it looks like to me.<br>
<br>
We have most of the country involved in the highest state of patriotism since WWII, to capture Bin Laden now would bring that to a close. Peple would go back to the &quot;let the world deal with their own problems&quot; B.S. I'm sorry but as any good politicain would do Bush's going to play it out until the end, and then beat it like a dead horse.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I didn't vote for the man for a reason.<br>
<br>
This country stands for alot, and now that the people are backing it, and his ratings just keep climbling, he can and WILL play it out until the next election.<br>
<br>
Bet ya 5 buck we catch OBL after Bush gets re-elected.<br>

Aoladari, I believe you are giving Bush much more credit than he deserves. I don't believe he is that smart or even that conniving. However, I do agree with you that he will &quot;beat it like a dead horse&quot; come election time.<br>
<br>
However, US citizens tend to not give our Presidents credit for victories on foreign soil. George W. Bush senior lost re-election to Bill Clinton even though Bush senior had a very high approval rating going into the election due to how he handled Desert Storm.<br>
<br>
I think US citizens will reel under the pain of a worsening economy once the dust settles in New York and we count our loses much more closely. Personally, I think most Americans want to see Osama bin Laden butchered (count me amongst them!). Once we have victory over the bastards who bombed us, we can turn our attention to domestic affairs and that is where Bush is a chump. He will probably lose re-election because he know jack about how to run an economy. Err... I think I will do the same as you did...<br>

Bush has enough people to do the work for him in this issue. It'll only look like he's doing it because someone has their hand up his ass pulling the puppet strings. I've always had that feeling about him, like he's no better than a puppet.<br>

Very true, however that war was not a result of something that happened on our soil. With the WTC attacks, everyone will remember all the speaches Bush has made, to make everyone feel better about themselves, our country, and our military. <br>

He will only lose the re-election (IMO) if he has beaten ObL and the Taliban by re-election time. Thats why he'll draw everything out and he will put the economy on a shelf until further notice. <p>Aoladari Raveynfyre <BR>

No.  Do we know how much of that information China already had? Nope.  Will we ever? Maybe.  Who knows.  <br>
<br>
For those die-hards who want to peg him against the wall please refer to arms deals in Iran-Contra affair and the weaponry we supplied the Iraqis, Afghans, Israelis, Taiwan... probably forgetting a few.  I'm not going to waste the time to show what was connected with what but from my memmory at least some of these happened under the Reagan/Bush watch.  Right, well, we saw how the Iraqis and Afghans ended up, and Israel isn't doin that hot.  But anyway, I'm sure you'll ignore all of this since I didn't annotate every word.<br>

Oh, yes, and for those ultra-conservatives that think Clinton is a traitor to the country and a scoundrel:<br>

Nifty little independent piece done by a british journalist.  Oh wait, England is a communist state since it is government supported socialism, should trust them pinko commie journalists.  Hell, that must mean all journalists are the devil, better return to news by word of mouth, much more objective. Or, of course, we could give voice to the little guys of journalistic institutions, like foxnews:<br>

Give me a break.  For every reason you give me for Clinton &quot;unleashing&quot; bin Laden I can dig up another for how Reagan/Bush/Shrub(Bush Jr.) did the same: Weapons flow into Afghanistan, occupation in Saudi Arabia (but wait, troops in Serbia is an outrage), isolationist attitude toward the middle east in general.  Oh, right, we need international policy geared towards the interests of America. Well damn, look where that policy got us.<br>

<br>
1.) I don't know everything about anything<br>
<br>
2.) You don't know everything about anything<br>
<br>
3.) Someone will disagree with me.<br>
<br>
4.) I will disagree with most.<br>
<br>
5.) Everyone is only partially right.<br>
<br>
Now to my point.<br>
<br>
-Clinton didn't unleash Bin Laden...he just didn't take advantage of opportunities to stop him.  Of course, that only means he didn't have the foresight to see what Bin Laden (and whatever Bin Laden stands for) was/is capable of.  Hindsight is 20/20<br>
<br>
-American foreign policy is an oxymoron.  In order to be a policy, it has to have some platform or basis (think of Verant and its Vision).  US foreign decisions seem to be based on what is best for the people making the decision at that moment.  Although, I guess that would be a policy.<br>
<br>
-Republicans and Democrats are both to blame for EVERYTHING that goes wrong and EVERYTHING that goes right.<br>
<br>
-Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush...not to mention the ones that came before them.  The beginning of the end for America.  It all started with the reverence of Kennedy (who was as big a lush as Clinton).<br>
<br>
-I'm no longer a student...but I still read textbooks.<br>
<br>
-I don't smoke, but I don't mind if others do.   <br>
<br>
-I over eat because I can. <br>
 <br>
-I exercise because I work behind a desk.  <br>
<br>
-I'm on a message board because I'm bored. <br>
<br>
-I'm posting this because the sound of my typing drowns out the voices in my head. <p>-----------------------------------------<br>

The fact that your ignorance and lack of knowledge shine with every post begs me to want to see you post more of your intellectual vomit.  Please continue to regale us with what you think you know so that I can continue to laugh at you as well as feel sorrow about the state of education today. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugladetree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladetree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/4/02 8:29:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well...</span><hr size=1> argue my points and maybe i'll feel threatened.

I am a fairly liberal person, but I felt that Clinton is one of the Democratic parties great failures.  He could have been a lot more than he was, and he was not hampered so much by partisan politics as by his own character flaws.  I think you will find that most of those who voted for Clinton, or supported his policies, will feel the same, or very similar, to the way that I do.  That said, Republicans simply do not have the moral high ground in this debate.  Osama bin Laden and the mujahadeen WERE funded by government funds; where do you think all those Kalashnikovs came from?  Iraq WAS courted by the United States, and funded in a fight against Iraq.  You are welcome to your own interpretation of the standing (Republican) presidents actions (and those of their administration) during these, and other events, but the fact is they did occur.  No amount of obfuscation, shouting, or vehement denials can change this fact.<br>
<br>
Generalizations based on political offiliation are a joke.  To demonize all Republicans as heartless proponents of corporate exploitation is just as bogus as to claim all Democrats are &quot;bleeding heart liberals.&quot;  I, for one, will never make those sorts of generalizations, because it leads to overly simplistic, &quot;black and white&quot; views of the political dialogue.  One of the true strengths of America is the freedom of political discourse, and that often means the freedom to hold different views than the current administration, and to disagree vocally with the views of your peers.  You are more than welcome to hold your own views on any issue, but if you want the rest of the community to accept your views as gospel, please be kind enough to back them up with facts, and do not whitewash over any parties failings just because you are a supporter.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as far as &quot;Liberal&quot; bias, in say... textbooks.  How many of these books have you looked at?  Most of these authors strive for as little bias as possible in their books, mainly because the Conservative right is so vocal about the &quot;Liberal slant.&quot;  I applaud any attempt to lessen the slant and bias in media; I deserve to have easy access to non-biased information, untinted by an idealogical, corporate, religious, or political filter.  However, many times I see Conservative critics and mavens arguing, in essence, that if ANY media source or outlet is not Conservative, then ALL are hotbeds of Liberal sentiment, and urging that media companies all crack down on the &quot;Liberal bias&quot; in their news agencies.  Repeat after me... Books, media, and journalists who do not embrace a Conservative viewpoint are not by default Liberal.<br>
<br>
Please post the facts that caused you to arrive at your viewpoints, Berval, so that the rest of the forum can judge them in comparison to the other views being presented here.  That, or admit that you are simply stating a non-informed opinion, and that it should be taken as such.  After all, any proponent of the truth would gladly do the same, neh? <p><center>Malevant Faeshadow<br>Speedbump<br> <br> Officer of the Free Company<br><IMG SRC="http://www.unicorntrad.org/three.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=251.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=251.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=251.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=251.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=54><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=251.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=251.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
