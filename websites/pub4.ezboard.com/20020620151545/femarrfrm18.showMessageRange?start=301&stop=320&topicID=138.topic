<br>
But then some of the things you said still rang too wrong to me for me to stay silent.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #1:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ...athiest base their ideals and form their ideals as a form of defense against the same religious fanatics (you) athiests oppose. Atheism is a philosphy formed by negative feelings(those feelings developed by negative experiences in society) and is supported by the ignorant acts committed by religious fanatics throughout history.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No. My ideals are based on looking around and taking in what information is self-evident and then drawing every logical connection possible from that. Contrary to what most think, morals don't just magically appear in your mind (whether through some &quot;divine&quot; being's will or your own emotions); virtues are based off of the protection and preservation of what one regards as valuable. Atheism is not a declaration of amoralism—it's a purely theological term, regarding belief in creators and gods; nothing more. What you are trying to do is offer a sort of idealogical &quot;package deal&quot; where you say that morals depend on the god's will, and when one doesn't believe in the god, one has no morals.<br>
<br>
Fallacy #2:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You have been victimized by this perverse(perverse not meant in its sexual conotation) world of ours. But thats what we do best. Twist and turn the truth for our own advantage. So I understand why people are athiest.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm not sure how you can condemn the universe (the one your almighty god made) as &quot;perverse,&quot; but okay... Here you are apparently assuming that I damn this world. I don't. I love life, this universe, this reality. I do not recognize a large amount of stupid people as having any sort of power to alter the nature of reality; so although I've become disenchanted with the majority of the population here, I understand that they don't shape reality, that reality is what it is, regardless of the idiots running loose. I don't base love off of some &quot;divine&quot; being's will either. I base my love (of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anything</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) on the things I hold as values, and I hold the recognition of reality as my highest value. I don't twist or turn what I perceive. I take it in and base my judgements from that.<br>
<br>
Atheism and agnosticism are not quite defined by the negation of gods—a more full explanation would be the perception of reality and the recognition that nowhere in that perception (or the concepts drawn from them) can one find proof (hard or logical) that a supreme creator must exist. It doesn't entail unhappiness.<br>
<br>
By the way, I'm sure you've noticed by now, but isn't it somewhat odd that you denounce religions and yet believe in the spokesman for one of the largest religions out there? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1900<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/19/01 9:36:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you believe in god?</span><hr size=1> I just looked up the definitions of both atheist and agnostic.  The atheist is simply one who does not believe in the existence of a god or gods.  Agnostic can mean a couple of different things; one who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a god, or one who is skeptical of the existence of a god or gods but does not profess true atheism.  Neither of these involve an opposition to religion or people who are religious.  While there certainly are those who have an axe to grind with Christianity or organized religion in general, taking the same prejudiced attitudes toward those who choose not to be religious will not help the situation.  Nor is it terribly becoming of one who claims to think that Jesus is &quot;cool&quot;.  I guarantee he wouldn't/doesn't approve. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

I am not prejudice towards athiests.  Religion is a Mandmade concept.  and i don't know why you brought that &quot;grace&quot; shit up.  I never said anything about that in regards to my beliefs.  I believe that there is something special about all beliefs that encompass positive stigma.  I just told you that i could give a rat's ass what you believe in.  I'm just giving my opinion about the matter.  I am an open-minded person.  I try to see the beauty in everything.  and yes, i do see beauty in atheism.  not much, but some.  everyone in this world is a bit pissed off with the way life is.  And someone who says differently is full of shit.  I'm not one of those people who likes to pretend that &quot;everything is A-ok&quot;, so that i can look like some kind of great person in front of others.  I tell it how it is.  Keep being an atheist, i dont give a shit.  I personally think its =to denial but whatever floats your boat.  Even Religious people turn form their religion at times to ignore the moral, ethical coonflicts in life.  Its important to shy away form issues.  Hence, everquest.  But doing it all the time is not healthy.  Its not my job to make you believe in God.  I dont give a &quot;rat's dick&quot; if you do or dont.  I know that you will eventually find out the truth and time goes on.  I(in my beliefs) want everyone to know about God and Jesus because they are special to me and want others to feel that also.  100% of people will eventually believe in the existance of God and Jesus.  My previous comments were a discussion I had with another person.  Some of what i have said within the last 2 or so were with you.  I am finished telling you why I think atheism is a belief which involves denial and ignorance and which is downright Silly.  I don't feel that I should keep explaining that.  But you have taken my comments out of context when you say that i am prejudice towards athiests and im not claiming anything about Grace.  So dopnt put words in my mouth.  Your comments were out of line with what i said.  Mabye you have a cognitive form of dyslexia &lt;------??  Why else would you claim things that i never said.  Because i think a belief i silly doesnt mean i am prejudice.  thats like me saying, &quot;All atheists are prejudice towards Christians&quot; because atheists dont believe in christianity.  Whatever man.  And i agree and believe that your system of beliefs is based on &quot;i look around and see&quot; because your thoughts are about as superficial as the things you see with your eyes.  Your thoughts are about as deep as one who judges someone based on their skin color.  Those people judge with their eyes also Triff.  Keep &quot;looking around&quot;.  LOL, you'll be spinning yourself dizzy.  Arikel, same goes for you.  Just because you dont agree with someones beliefs doesnt mean you are prejudice towards them.  Get your head out of your ass, your nose is being influenced by your brain.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xamael>Xamael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/20/01 6:15:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> God is like cigarettes to some people.

Maybe God shows himself to different races and cultures because its easier for them to undertsand him.<br>

  The Indians saw a White Spirit,why couldnt that have been the form God choose to visist them with,or anyother religion in that matter.I guess we all need something to believe in,maybe its because we feel like we are incomplete without believeing in something.<br>

Great, I seem to have struck a chord =) Look at ya...You're so pissed about me when I tell u the Truth. You just can't accept it that the only way to attempt to hurt me is to slander my mom? LOL....Man u r so funny...The words u use....tsk tsk tsk...If there is a hell, then u just gained the first class seat pal =p But we all know that's not gonna happen. Why? Because there is no true hell. Hmm let's see if u were a pure sinner when u died, would u choose to go to a Catholic Hell, Methodist Hell or Protestant Hell? Your damn religion is in itself divided with their own so called 'true' definitions of Christianity. So tell me which is the 'true' teaching? U can't tell me cos u don't know. If a certain god  exists, then how come there are so many religions? he must be real multi-talented LOL.<br>
<br>
   In conclusion, god does not exist. He's just a fairytale, just like Harry Potter, just like Everquest. Oh and Brutos after u read this and if u get mad, go see the priest or pray lest u do somethin like rape yr pet cat to release tension or reply to this post and talk about my mom in childish anger =)<br>

If you don't believe in God then don't.  I don't care if you do or don't.

Isn't that what you believe in Xamael??  Life is nothing but coincidental existance to you.  So who cares about your slut mother?  She is nothing but an animal right Xamael?? She will die and turn into a rotting heap of dried blood, magget ridden meat.  Thats right isn't it Xamael?  And thats what life is about??  I'm not angry with you.  I just think you are a coward who can't handle life and so you crawl into your little cave and pretend there is nothing to figure out about life.  There is no God and nothing after death.  Thats the easy way out, and thats what makes you a coward;  someone who gives up.  You are a quitter and so is your slut mother...   But don't be angry Xamael.

Your atheist also right?  We are still animals and Bound by nature.  We will reproduce like animals and die liek them too.  If you and other guy there are really athiests like you say;  then why would you even feel the need to respond to the &quot;Do you believe in God&quot; post????( A real athiest wouldn't respond to somehting that doesn't matter)   Its because you aren't atheist.  In fact, I think it is Extremely rare that anyone be an atheist(i mean like 1 in a million).  Atheist to me is somoene with some serious issues(not that people who say they believe in God don't have issues either)  Atheism is a response to a complicated situation(one might say the same for believing in God as well)  It's a developed thought pattern which protects, defends and/or shelters one against feelings of confusion,frustration, hopelessness and helplessness(again, one might say the same for believing in God as well).  It's difficult for me to be objective because of my strong faith in God. but if anything I would say I rather believe in something than nothing.  Soemthing matters; whatever it may be, but nothing doesn't matter.  'Nothing' is actually something, but it is something that has no real function or consequence, hence the idea of that other guys mom dying and it meaning nothing.  Or also when I called his mother a slut whore cocksucking bitch and compared her to a dog and in turn exclaimed &quot;that it didn't matter cause there is no God anyway&quot;.  BUT, that guy DID respond to my calling his mother those slanderous things; WHICH PROVES that he is NOT and atheist either. &lt;-----BECAUSE, a true atheist would not even respond to such garbage.(garbage meaning irrelevence)             Question for you Triff:  If you had all the answers, would you feel interested or curious anymore??  No I dont' think so &lt;--------REASON and logic which supports FAITH based belief.  FAITH being a union of heart and mind or Thought and Feeling. &lt;-------The same thing that makes the workd go 'round;  Order and Chaos.(chaos not in a bad sense, but being synonomous with change)  You, Triff are fooled by todays 'scientific-based thought'  its ok because most people are.  But science based thought is no better than any other fundamental which has been used in the evolution of humanity.  Just like Crawling when you are a baby might seem like it is inferior to walking but actually it is Crucial is the developement in a childs motor planning, which is used for mental growth as well.  Science does NOT contain all the answers nor will it ever.  God is not 'something' you can put in a box or sum up in a few words or feelings.  Thats what makes life beautiful.

<br>
Reason and logic do not support faith (and you failed to even support that statement, you used some circular logic there). Faith is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a union of thought and emotion: it is the subordination of thought to your emotions. Faith in no way supports thought. The very definition of faith is belief <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> without logical proof</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. It shouldn't need to be said, but it requires no thought to not think.<br>
<br>
Science is the study of reality. Scientific thought is proving things to yourself before believing them. &quot;God&quot; certainly is not something you can define, and no, I don't think life is made beautiful by your belief in some entity that can't be defined.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Stop loooking for science and other logic based ideas to shape the world you live in.

Humans see, think, and begin to recognize values. Emotions are then based on those values. There is no separation.

<br>
Just so you know (and yes I do believe in God and I do read the bible so flame me for it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  neither the bible, not God, ever say you should just feel and follow your emotions.  You defined fatih as belief without logical proof... and later (in response to Brut222) implied that only those who do not think for themselves would have faith.  Is that correct?  <br>
<br>
I have been taught something entirely different about faith.  Faith in God doesn't mean you rely on your emotions and withdrawl your brain from use.  I shall give you a definition here: taken from the Parson's Bible Dictionary<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Faith is in general the persuasion of the mind that a certain statement is true (Phil. 1:27; 2 Thess. 2:13). Its primary idea is trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. It admits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance with the evidence on which it rests.<br>
Faith is the result of teaching (Rom. 10:14-17). Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith (John 10:38; 1 John 2:3)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As you can see, what I have been taught regarding faith is quite different from what you stated above.  Basically, I believe faith = trust.  <br>
<br>
I trust God and believe His word to be true.  I believe Jesus died for my sins = I trust in Him that He has redeemed me.  That's my belief and I operate from that standpoint.  Many people I know did not arrive at the decision to believe in God based upon simple emotions.  Instead, as in all things in their lives, they came to the decision after careful consideration and research.  I mean come on, there are some hard questions that we all have... like Why does God allow evil to exist?  If He is all powerful, why doesn't he just eradicate it?  Why did he allow it in the first place?  Anyone who blindly follows and never questions would not be human.  I jsut believe that the answers provided to me are true.  I trust them, I trust God.  I have faith.  But I do assure you, my brain did not turn off simply because someone said &quot;This is So!&quot;  I think about it, and come to my own conclusions.  <br>
<br>
Think of it this way...  suppose you met a person who acted completely mad on teh street, accompanied by your Mother (whom you trust).  Lets say she says this person is jsut pretending to behave this way for an experiment.  You have faith that your mother is telling you the truth and therefore, even though this person's actions are really weird, you decide to trust her and accompany her.  After a couple hours you all go home and you see this person indeed, take off theri odd actions and become &quot;normal.&quot;  You trusted your Mother, you had faith, but you still questioned, yes?  Did your brain stop working?  No.  You might have even reconsidered following your Mom and this weirdo around all day, but you believed your Mother to be right, and so trusted her.<br>
<br>
What I have been taught is somewhat the same.  So, this may offer you a different viewpoint to consider.  Although I believe in God, I am not representative of all people who believe, so they probably have differning attitudes (see Brut222) regarding this post, but hey, I was reading all this and thought I'd throw a bit more into the mix.<br>
<br>
Btw, if my first paragraph regarding your faith statement wasn't true, then I jsut typed all this for nothing didn't I?  Darnit!!!!<br>

Within each of us (within our very cells) is a mini miracle. The fact that the cell nucleus stays together has mystified scientists for years- it can not be scientifically explained. It is classified as an anomoly and is simply dismissed by the evolutionsits.<br>
<br>
Jesus once said: &quot;Through me all things were made; without me nothing was made that has been made. In me was life, and that life was the light of men...Through me all things were created, and by me all things shall be held together.&quot; (john 1:14 I believe..)<br>

<br>
I was telling you that there are other alternatives out there than what you believe.  I think anyone that asked you to overhaul your whole life without seriously thinking about it and investigating it would be denying that very human aspect we all have - doubt.  Just because I believe doesn't mean I never doubt, it doesn't mean I don't question.  <br>
<br>
I'm not here to convince you that your style of life is wrong or that what you believe is wrong as compared to me.  However, simply because someone has faith in God doesn't mean that they required no proof.  Really, there is no way to either prove nor disprove scientifically the existence of God.  God exists outside science.  In the end, you end up deciding based upon the evidence you can evaluate.  <br>
<br>
Well, with all the evidence I have seen, I chose to believe.  It takes an extra step either way.  To believe or to reject.. its a decision.  Btw, accepting Christ doesn't mean overhauling your life, though there should certainly be changes as you grow with God.  God accepts you just as you are.  <br>
<br>
Oh and I checked my Websters (Websters New World Dictionary, 2nd College Edition, printed 1986, page 503) :<br>
faith: 1) unquestioning belief that doesn't require proof or evidence.<br>
<br>
This definition says faith doesn't require proof or evidence, not that none exists.  Of course it also says unquestioning, and I bet that a lot of people who believe in God have doubts at times.  Including me for awhile. <br>
<br>
/shrug.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this was all to offer you another viewpoint, but I think you missed it.  It was from a bible dictionary, citing bible verses.  My point was that the bible doesn't teach blind faith based on emotions.  <br>

Question Triff: Are feelings equal to thought?<br>

Which is more important Triff? or are they equally important?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->What I stated before is that emotions (feelings) stem from what your values are. Your values are formed either by what you have thought out yourself, or—if you have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> done that—based on whatever your subconscious has deemed is good or bad as you go through life (this would be closer to &quot;your feelings&quot; actually). This being so, what you (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> truly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) think/believe will govern what you feel, and so I consider thought more important.<br>
<br>
Love is a strong happy feeling you get towards someone or something that follows your values (i.e. you value him/her/it a lot). It is not causeless, not a feeling that just magically appears out of nowhere. Trying to know and understand the truth is the only way you can logically form your own values.<br>
<br>
I don't consider love as such to be a virtue, but I do consider the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ability</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to truly love as one. And I think that to truly/fully love something, you must first understand your values and work out all contradictions there may be in your thinking. I think that Reason is the most important tool of any human being.<br>

<br>
First: I think you are taking that quote and twisting its meaning to be a reference to nuclei (you think he was talking to people about atoms in the 1st century?). There is no evidence to support that—it's pretty similar to the people telling you to type in NYC in wingdings and heralding it as a link to terrorism.<br>
<br>
Second: Even supposing he did mean that, where is your proof that there was no one who had understood atomic science back then? There are any number of possibilities (from hidden civilizations to alien intervention) to lead to that; but even if none of those happened and somehow he still said it with that meaning in mind—it is not proof.<br>
<br>
Third: Where is your proof that there was a divine Jesus who ever said anything like that in the first place? All you have to cite for evidence is your Bible and some historical evidence that some man named Jesus probably did exist sometime around Year 0, around that relevent location.<br>
