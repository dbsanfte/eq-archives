What I stated was that Raedwulf's<br>
sensibilities(and yours) do not supersede anyone elses. It doesnt matter at all<br>
if I have children or not. I would never state it on a public forum. Too many strange people like yourself out there.<br>
<br>
To some people school is a prison, where they are consigned by their parents<br>
to eight hours of hell, at the hand of their 'peers'(that is being generous),<br>
five days a week. There is no escape. At least with a prison term you know when it will end.<br>
<br>
I suspect Carathos that YOU personally are an example of exactly that type of 'peer'. Someone who enjoys making other people unhappy. Yet you have the gall to wonder why they may react. Not unlike the jocks at Columbine.<br>
<br>
But that is ok. I agree with Nietzsche.<br>

Actually this isn't true, the parents do have the option to home school or use a private school.  Granted most private schools are religious or military based, the option is still there.<br>

But here are the facts:<br>
<br>
Opinion of the Court<br>
<br>
Here are my facts on how things are opinion; in every ruling the court makes it gives the statement <br>
“In the opinion of the court”<br>
<br>
18 Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314 (1952); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421<br>
(1962); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963); Abington School District v.<br>
Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 305 (1963) (Justice Goldberg concurring); Walz v. Tax<br>
Comm’n, 397 U.S. 664, 694–97 (1970) (Justice Harlan concurring). In the opinion<br>
of the Court in the latter case, Chief Justice Burger wrote: ‘‘The course of constitutional<br>
neutrality in this area cannot be an absolutely straight line; rigidity could<br>
well defeat the basic purpose of these provisions, which is to insure that no religion<br>
be sponsored or favored, none commanded, and none inhibited. The general principle<br>
deducible from the First Amendment and all that has been said by the Court<br>
is this: that we will not tolerate either governmentally established religion or governmental<br>
interference with religion. Short of those expressly proscribed governmental<br>
acts there is room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality<br>
which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference.’’<br>
<br>
 Also in this case above the court made the ruling that the First amendment to religion is not an absolutely straight line. But a case to be neutral to both sides.<br>
<br>
5 During House debate, Madison told his fellow Members that ‘‘he apprehended<br>
the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and<br>
enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any<br>
Manner contrary to their conscience.’’ 1 Annals of Congress 730 (August 15, 1789).<br>
<br>
Here is my cite, on how Madison who wrote the amendment wanted it to mean.  Notice how he has stressed worship God.<br>
<br>
Then the court came up with this theory on how to test if religion in the state.<br>
<br>
17 Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1, 16 (1947); Illinois ex rel. McCollum<br>
v. Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 211, 212 (1948); cf. Zorach v. Clauson, 343<br>
U.S. 306, 317 (1952) (Justice Black dissenting). In Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.<br>
<br>
There are three criteria that should be used to assess legislation: &quot;First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances or inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster and excessive government Entanglement with religion.&quot;<br>
<br>
Instituted the Lemon test for analyzing statutes relating to church-state interaction.<br>
<br>
Was this test applied to the Pledge to the Flag? NO IT WAS NOT, and this is the court ruling on how it is suppose to be judged.<br>
<br>
Now for some more food for thought, and cites and facts:<br>
Money: “In God we trust”<br>
Oath or Affirmation: It seems every office one takes these oaths. Notice the Bible and the word God?<br>
The most solemn event of the Presidential Inaugural festivities is the administration of the Oath of Office. The president-elect takes the Oath on the West Portico of the Capitol. The Chief Justice of the United States administers the Oath, and its text is prescribed in the United States Constitution (Article II, Section I, Clause 8). The President-elect places his hand on the Bible, raises his right hand, and takes the Oath as directed by the Chief Justice. The text is as follows<br>
&quot;I, name, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and I will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States<br>
Senate Briefings<br>
Oath of Office<br>
I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.<br>
OATH OF OFFICE--MEMBERS, RESIDENT COMMISSIONER, AND DELEGATES The oath of office required by the sixth article of the Constitution of the United States, and as provided by section 2 of the act of May 13, 1884 (23 Stat. 22), to be administered to Members, Resident Commissioner, and Delegates of the House of Representatives, the text of which is carried in 5 U.S.C. 3331: I, AB, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God. <br>
Even when you get sworn in to testify in a court of law, and your hand is place over the Bible<br>
In a court setting to answer in the affirmative when asked: “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth – so help you God<br>
Also your claim that the Constitution writers where not religious is bogus.<br>
Facts I have.  Most of all of them where. I took the actual time to go read every Biography of each signer of the Constitution.<br>

Looks like most of them were Christian to me.<br>
But the argument is still; “Under God” passes the Lemon TEST. So where is the facts saying it fails this test, which the Supreme Court made rulings on how to test for religion in state????<br>
<br>
They didn’t do one; all it sounds like to me is a judge making a name for himself.<br>

Glori,  I am damn impressed at the research and what not that you have done.  However, and this is my own personal opinion of course,  it would seem to me that while indeed many of them had off views of religion.  I do not think that means they were not religious.  It seems they simply were able to seperate having religion from organized religion.  While they may not be Christian,  they (from other things I have read) did seem quite religious.  Although, you clearly pointed out that they didnt want organized religion and government to interact.<br>
<br>
Other than that,  this really is a dead end topic.  Regardless of the outcome someone is going to be screwed.  Over what?  Words.  To some, the words "under God" have great profound meaning, to others it is simply part of the text, and to others it is simply invisible and not given a second though in any way.  Some folks want to say it,  other folks don't.  Regardless if it is PART of the text or not,  people in general should be able to be intelligent enough to handle this.  It isn't being forced on anyone to say those words.   <br>
<br>
Not saying those words is not going to protect someone from the scrutiny of other kids in the class.  Afterall, if their beliefs should be the reason behind them not saying it, then other things they do in life will equally reflect their beliefs so anyone who is going to get on them for it still will just for other reasons.<br>
<br>
Saying those words does not force a belief on anyone.  Also, there is no way to prevent someone from not wanting to hear GOD  to not hear it.   We can't stop anyone from hearing anything they dont want to hear unless they live in a sound proof box.  <br>
<br>
<br>
It also is not forcing a religous view on anyone as it does not change a persons day to day life.  <br>
<br>
Being forced to not eat bovine, or being forced to honor lent, or beign forced to sacrifice a chicken on the third tuesday after a full moon before a monsoon in the spring.   These are things that force a religous belief on someone.   <br>
<br>
Me walking up to you and saying God,  or saying  I live in this country under God or even saying You live in this country under god. . does not change or force you to see religion differently. Unless of course you are not secure in your own religion but that is a different thread. <br>
<br>
Not to mention, with so many other serious issues (much more serious and life effecting) than "under god" existing.. this is a waste of time, and in the end..  really doesnt better anything or anyone.  As I said in the beginning, regardless of the outcome of this,  someone is going to be screwed.<br>

PuhLEeeze!<br>
<br>
your kiddin right? <br>
<br>
the average 'impressionable youngster' doesnt even know what 'nationalisitic rhetoric' means....<br>
<br>
a fifth grader stands in class at 8am, recites the pledge with hand over heart. do you honestly believe they really know what they are saying? let alone care? HELL NO! they are thinking 'when is recess' or 'i wonder if billy brought his toy' or 'bobby picked his nose on the bus and then ate it' etc..<br>
<br>
Prejudice is something you learn..not something your born with.<br>
<br>
prejudice == preconcieved judgment or opinion.<br>
meaning :: I dont think they care either way == no prejudice. <br>
<br>
After all, I dont think it was the daughter of the nut-job that took this to court.<br>
<br>
If your worried about what 'impressionable youngsters' hear ...I think you have MUCH bigger fish to fry than this one. First Stop...Hollywood!<br>
<br>
/sarcasm<br>
because we all know that the words 'under god' are much more demeaning and demoralizing than the words 'god damn it' being said right after some dudes head gets blown off by a rocket launcher ...right ? RIGHT!?<br>

Issues with teachers teaching nationalistic rhetoric on youngsters you say, you must of failed history class when you were in grade school dude! Maybe you need to read the history book, or then again, since teachers are forced to teach children national American history that is unconstitutional too?<br>

Imagine if you will a student in say 6th grade. Imagine the student has an antipathy against hearing the word 'God' however he has a different way of expressing it.<br>

What would happen to this student if every time he heard the word 'God' <br>
he said 'Satan'?<br>
How about 'Shiva'?<br>
How about 'Allah'?<br>

<br>
As a student that always boggled my mind... saying God in the pledge of allegiance in kindergarden and first grade sure in hell didnt phase me and I dont believe in God.  I've resented "God" since I was about 6 years old.  Saying the pledge and using "God" isnt going to change any child's background or beliefs.  I always believed that every religion has "A God" and that each "God" just has a different name... so I still dont see what the big deal is.<br>
<br>
If you ask a Jewish person "who is your God" most likely they will say "in english we say God, in Hebrew we say Hashem, or Jehovah" so they call their God "God" too.  If you ask someone who worships Satan "who is your God" they will say "Satan" either way its "their God"... blah!  With Buddhism it may be different, I understand, but do they not consider the being that they worship their "God"?<br>
<br>
I see no reason, however, why the original pledge cant be used and adjusted to.  It (under God) was added to counter an athiest movement so it can be removed just as easily.    <p>Baroness Syldra Marlowe<br>High Priest ~ Affliction<p><font size=1>
It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.  On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls- as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.

A defendant by the way is not required to testify. Thus he need NOT take any oath<br>
to tell the truth. Also in most states you are NOT required to take an oath to god.<br>
For example in Mass. it is 'according to the penalties and laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts'<br>
God doesnt even enter the equation.<br>
<br>
You do prove my point however. It is ok by you to force people to hear the word 'God' but you cant tolerate the word 'Satan' <br>
<br>
I thank you for that proof.<br>
