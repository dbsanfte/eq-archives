I had quite a few people tell me that they thought it was ran well, we did have some problems with loot from one of the giants, but i was told by the person that they worked it out with a GM.  Also I looted a pair of Mithril Greeves, we were suposed to roll on them when we reached the buff hall, but with the confusion we had getting buffs done it got forgot about, i still have the item in the bank, if i remember the stats were 10 ac, 7 str, i still want to give people a chance for the item who attended, if you are interested in the legs, please post here, so we can get together in game sometime to still do a roll for them, I do not need them.  This was my first Lead on a Naggy raid, but plan on doing some more, gonna do more preparing next time though.  Ok that is enough of my rambling, thanks for listening if you did lol.<br>

Before you start slamming peeps maybe you should lead a few. <br>
<br>
Its not my fault people weren't listening to me. I tried, they seen the dragon and rushed in after i told them to wait and i couldn't get him in the doorway. <br>
<br>
And as far as me loggin after i got my corpse... i had to work that next day and didn't see any reason why i should stick around its not like i can run in and grab a corpse. You want me to hold everyones hand and sing koomby-ya? And i met Tarnith on the way and he had the gate open for me.<br>

And second for the thought that I should lead a few, I know I should, This was my first, but that does chance anything, about the way things went, On your raid, yes the people did charge the Dragon when they were not suposed to, so how does that effect that I should lead a few more, the one I lead only Problem I really seen we had, was that we might not have had a strong enough force, and it seemed, that towards the end, a few char's decided to run for safety, once they thought there was no more chance of dropping him, but either way, none of that really matter, cause we both attempted dropping him but neither succeded, but I know I plan on leading many more. <p>Gravdiger (51st Season Champion) <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131975">Gravdiger's Gear<a/>

<br>
Imho a raid leader is responsible to stay til the very end at all costs, if you cant do that because of work etc there is no reason to lead a raid (unless you have someone to back you up when you go like a co-leader)... I think its bad form and would never raid with someone who would bail on a failed raid they led whether they could help or not.<br>
<br>
Any raid can last an extended period of time, the raid leader of all people should be willing to give the most time... always expect the worst and if the time involved is too much make sure you clarify it before hand *shrug*<br>
<br>
And I think its funny people charged early... usually the problem comes from people afraid to rush in and sitting in buffhall picking their noses :P <p><a href="http://www.19wheels.com"><img src="http://www.19wheels.com/images/circle_19-2.gif">

<br>
If you are raid leader, those other people are your responsibility under your watch.  If they screw up, it's your job to coach them, teach them, and kick whoever is ruining it for the 24 other people off the raid.  Even if it's your own brother.<br>
<br>
You are responsible for getting everyone out.  You are responsible for getting everyone rezzed.  You are responsible for being an effective communicator.  If you must log, delegate a representative, and pass the leadership on.<br>
<br>
This is just my opinion.  There are those who will say &quot;It's just a game, I don't need to waste my friggin time for 24 people I don't even really know, and I gotta work in the morning&quot;.  Fair enough, that's your opinion.<br>
<br>
I think my view is better.  When I log early on a raid I'm leading, I make sure I put someone else in charge, and I make sure it's someone good.  The 24 people who showed up at my behest have never failed to appreciate me for this.  And funny enough, it makes it easier to make friends and get help later in life.<br>
<br>
Your mileage may vary.<br>

<br>
It comes down to this. Did you learn fomr your mistakes? (planning a raid, as Jex said, when you know you have to worka d not allowing tiem for CR, is just poor form).<br>
<br>
Also, NEVER, criticize your leadership. Do you know better? Is this leader doing something SERIOULSY wrong? If you answer eys to both these questions, here is what I usually do:<br>
<br>
Offer advice and qonctructive criticism.<br>
<br>
They can either take your advice, or they can blow you off. If the ladder, leave.<br>
<br>
Also, before you can be a good leader, you must be a good follower. Grave, by showing you could not be a good follower, I question your skills as a leader.<br>
<br>
Both of you should look at the mistakes you made, learn from them, and try again. I believe both of you can become very good raid leaders in time. Hell, I still have a LOT to learn. I wouldn't be the raid leader I am now though, if I didn't have people willing to follow me. And these people would not be willing to follow me if I hadn't demonstrated a capability to learn my role and play it well. <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137525" target = _newwindow_>Medion Palemoon</a>
