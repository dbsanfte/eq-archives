Signed on with MSN and would have periods of not being able to connect for longer than 1-2 minutes at a time BUT I could at least, during its calm times, connect and play on EQ even with constant PL  I could get in and stay in for long periods of time.<br><br>On to now. Yesterday the husband went and bought a new external modem, Creative Modem Blaster V.90 External DE5625, and EQ decided it didn't want to stay connected (if it got past the server select at all), MSN decided it didn't either (even moreso than before), and new frustrations began. <br><br>I have gone all through the settings and configurations of the  Modem and INet connection and have checked, unchecked, added and taken away anything and everything I thought might help keep the connection open. I subscribed to a NEW ISP and the connection is stable except SOMETHING isn't letting me stay connected to EQ. I can get to the char select screen sometimes but either before I get there or right after it will disconnect. I started watching the modem when this happened and noticed that the &quot;CS&quot; light will go out for about 10-20 seconds and disconnect me from EQ. If its just lag how do I get it to just let it come and not disconnect me? WTF is going on, why and what can I do to get it fixed aside from MAYBE uninstalling EQ and reinstalling it(last resort because it will take EONS to get all the patches and the new ISP has an unavoidable disconnect after being connected for 4 hours straight)?<br><br>If anyone can help or has info I'd appreciate it cuz this is frustrating as hell.<br><br>TIA <p><P><div align=center><img src="http://www.ulujain.org/albums/album04/aat.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60625"><b><i>52 Pathfinder of Tunare</i></b></a> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44400"><i>56 Templar of Innoruuk</i></a><br><b><i>Member of <a href="http://pub40.ezboard.com/berollisisheart">Erollisi's Heart</a> <a href="mailto:alethia_tamire@yahoo.com">EMAIL</i></b></a></div><P></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigota.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Igota</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 917<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/22/02 2:16:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ connection problems - Need help from those who can</span><hr size=1> Not what you are looking for, but it might be a memmory timing issue, odds are rather small, but if you can take out your RAM and put in a friend's that will rule out that possibility.<br> <p><BR><BR><center><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39932'>Gohz</a>||<a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30892'>Igota</a> (On hiatus)<br><a href=http://inferno.wittsend.com/>Inferno's Hand</a><br><font color='yellow' size='2'>You have become better at pwning Chiteng!

Turn off EVERYTHING in EQ. All the new graphics, all sky effects, clip plane to zero, etc. If that helps, start cranking back up until you find a good balance.<br><br>2. Play with the datarare.txt file inside the EQ dir. There are a lot of &quot;recommended&quot; settings people throw out, but I'd suggest just moving the number around some to see if it has any effect. It prolly won't.<br><br>3. Call your ISP and ask them if they have any suggestions for a better connection based on the type of modem you have. Sometimes they can give you an init string or a few setup tweaks to help you out, though that generally worked better on the older modems.<br><br>4. Connect to the internet and watch your connection without anything actually running. If your bandwidth is being hammered even while you're not actively surfing, playing, or anything of the sort you probably have some software hijacking your bandwidth/processing for someone esle's benefit. I find this to be the case on about 90% of all computers I service. Run Ad Aware. www.lavasoftusa.com<br><br>5. Are you actually connecting at 56k? Your phone line itself could be tapped to limit you to 33.6 or less, or could even be tapped, cheap, and old, which would create havok with would-be persistent internet applications. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uiso101.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iso101</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.madasafish.com/~egolectric/files/isoicon1011.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/22/02 7:33:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ connection problems - Need help from those who can</span><hr size=1>  Have a similar problem myself but can get round it by just spending 30 seconds reinstalling the modem whenever I start the computer.

We're experiencing this while downloading stuff as well. It stops for 10-15 seconds for resuming the download. It's like the port is running too fast for the modem. I've messed with every port setting I cn think of, FIFO receive/transmits, port speeds, changed from Xoff/Xon control to hardware flow control, you name it.

You might say don't fix something that isn't broken but let me assure you that even though you don't know it ME was broken.<br><br>Second you now have a nice new operating system that does all your ICQ steering for you however this is a new feature. As such it conflicts with your hardware which may tell the Operating system to do something it really doesnt want to do. This could mean your new OS is at fault but more then likely its your modem.<br><br>My guess is the way to solve this problem is by opining your BIOS at startup ( usually done by hammering F2 or delete as you start your machine ) and cycle through the pages until you find the stuff about IRQ's. In there you will find a setting that says something like<br><br>&quot;Reserve  IRQ for modem&quot; and usually the option is set to IRQ 3<br><br>Change this to n/a or Assigned by OS ( basically anything other then a specific IRQ ) and try EQ again.<br><br>I've seen this problem many times before and it's caused by the modem being assigned to an IRQ that XP is already using. In the case of a friends it was his display card which was disconnecting his modem when a 3D application tried to run ( sound familiar? )<br><br>Another machine I was asked to look at had the modem conflicting with the mouse so everytime the person moved the mouse the modem disconnected ( nice huh? )<br><br>Other things to look at. If you're on dial up call your phone provider and ensure they do not cap the line as stated above. If they don't explain that you have a bad internet connection and that would like the gain on the line turned up. This will give you a slight echo on your phone calls but should increase the transfer rate on your modem.<br><br>Other things to look at. Check the state of the local wiring if you can. If you can find the box outside your house get a pen and nudge all the wires. If any come loose or move in any way it's possible you have a loose wire and a quick call to the phone company from a friends ( or mobile ) saying that you can't make calls will have them come check.<br><br>P.S. I recommend everyone on dial-up have their gain upped regularly. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com"><IMG SRC="http://www.plattsflello.com/ryn.gif" BORDER=0></A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utovectris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tovectris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/02 4:42:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ connection problems - Need help from those who can</span><hr size=1> Ok, lemme see if I get this straight...<br><br>You had WinME, upgraded it in-place to XP, then installed a new video card after the fact, and now have a new modem as well. Windows is nowhere near as upgradeable as MS keeps telling us it is, and those in-place upgrades have somewhere around a 1.6% success rate.<br><br>To make matters worse, Windows ME was the worst OS Microsoft ever put out. Even with an in-place upgrade a lot of the crap still exists.<br><br>Simple fix? Put the Windows XP disk in, boot the computer, and reinstall. This time when it gets to the section where it asks what partition to install on select the primary partition and press D, then Enter, then L. You'll lose everything on that drive, but when Windows gets reinstalled your problems will most likely have magically dssapeared. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1847<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/02 5:44:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ connection problems - Need help from those who can</span><hr size=1> Sorry but I can't state just how wrong you are on that one. <br><br>I was told this exact same thing a while back and I checked that because my only copy of XP is an upgrade version ( a lot of people have these ) and I was upgrading from 98. I wanted to make sure that I didn't have any dodgy files from 98 when I installed. First off I checked MS help site and their is an article their about the upgrade procedure. You can find it by searching for upgrade at microsoft.com.

Please be advised that MS HAS to tell you that the system will be in the exact state it needs to be in whether you upgrade or re-install.  This is their POLICY.  If they don't tell you that, you might think their operating systems don't work as they are intended to... Goddess forbid anyone would consider MS a flakey operating system.<br><br>There are numerous inconsistencies with upgrading over re-installing.  You can even verify this by searching the same knowledgebase you found your original article in.  If it was as flawless as MS reports it to be, there would be NO NEED for this same knowledgebase.<br><br>I don't speek to you as one that only dables at home with this OS.  I've been forced to deal with MS operating systems since waaaaaay before Windows came into existance and am speaking from profession and personal experiences.  Sometimes you get lucky (and I do mean it) when you upgrade and everything works correctly.  Most of the time however you will not be this fortunate.  <br><br>I'd like to point out that there was a very good idea posted earlier about IRQ's and your BIOS.  I was going to post the same info after reading all the posts to ensure I didn't duplicate someones idea.  I'd definately check that one.  After that, try uninstalling your modem completely and then re-installing the driver.  <br><br>Please don't take this as an attack or a flame.  I'm only pointing out (like you) that everyone has a different experiences when it comes to their OS and there is not one path that always works.<br> <p><b>May the Circle be unbroken</b><br><br><b>Greywolffe Silverstarr</b><br>59th Templar of Tunare</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1849<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/02 6:39:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ connection problems - Need help from those who can</span><hr size=1> MS dont have to tell me anything. If that we're so surely it would be their policy to tell you that the full version is better considering the upgrade is cheaper and nets them less money.<br><br>If it is indeed the policy to tell people that it is the same and it isn't they would be begging for a law suit. Sorry,..another law suit.<br><br>Whereas I agree that on occasions upgrades do not work I refuse to believe that the success rate is anywhere near as low as 1.6%. I've upgraded hundreds of machines over a 4 year period including over 50 upgrades of 98 and ME to XP. If it was anywhere near 1.6% I'd have had installed.....exactly .8 computers succesfully. So far Im on 100% success rate.<br><br>The reason that full formats appear smoother is that when you upgrade to XP it won't have any issues with software or drivers because you won't have any installed. Whereas it will report them in an upgrade. However a full format has the benefit of getting rid of faulty files from 3rd party which may be causing errors.<br><br>Although I agree that it is good to have a clearout of your sytem now and again I think the problem is that often a full format can be quicker then solving the issue at hand. This leads to ( no disrespect intended to other computer technicians who have ever advised a format ) sloppy technicians who scream format before they've even looked at the issue.<br><br>It also leads to the industry being populated by people fresh out of college with a very basic qualification thinking they are up to a job they are not. Simply as soon as they get any problem they format and reinstall and they've &quot;fixed the error&quot; <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com"><IMG SRC="http://www.plattsflello.com/ryn.gif" BORDER=0></A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugreywolffe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Greywolffe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/02 7:18:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ connection problems - Need help from those who can</span><hr size=1> However, you need to look at the skill level of the &quot;average&quot; home user.  Which do you believe someone will buy...an upgrade that is supposed to solve all their woes by just inserting a cd and following the screen prompts; or a full version that will have them doing things on a pc they have only read about in a magazine?<br><br>MS techsupport is filled with the same people that you you describe as &quot;fresh out of college&quot;.  Their tier one techsupport (the people most of us get to chat with) are using their limited personal knowledge of problem solving along with helpdesk software that has standard questions they need to ask.  I'll say that again, STANDARD QUESTIONS that are in a database they search as soon as you give them enough info on your error.  That's why you get questions like: &quot;Is the little light on the monitor green or yellow?&quot;  or &quot;Is the machine plugged in?&quot;<br><br>To most computer geeks these questions are unwarranted and downright degrading.  However to a vast majority of PC owners they seem like intelligent and well thought out debugging techniques.  AND make the person on the other end seem godlike.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I'm not downgrading helpdesk personnel.  I've been in that seat and believe me it's not one I'd wish on anyone.  It's just that they have their rules and policies to follow.  Yes, it is MS's policy to tell you their stuff works as it's intended to work.  They'd be foolish not too say that.  This does not open them up to any type of lawsuit due to the fact that it is true.<br><br>However, this truth is like the truth you hear from politicians at election time.  It's only true in certain contexts.  MS's software upgrade path is successful 100% of the time if you upgrade with the same standards as their QA testing.  Now I know of no one that even knows what that standard is let alone anyone that has ever followed it.  My personal thought however that it does not entail upgrading with any other applications installed that do not bear the MS label.  How many systems do you think MS tests that have Lotus Notes installed?  Netscape?  EQ?  I'd wager a guess of not many.<br><br>A full re-install of an operating system is the only guarenteed way to ensure there are no problems carried over from one operating system to the next.  If your operating system is working well and you wish to upgrade to the latest and greatest then you will probably not experience any problems.  I agree that there are many alternatives to a full format/reinstall but to say it's not neccessary a majority of the time is in my estimation incorrect.<br><br>I wish you luck on your problem and hope there will be an insightful post here to debugging your problem. <p><b>May the Circle be unbroken</b><br><br><b>Greywolffe Silverstarr</b><br>59th Templar of Tunare</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udarueivywood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darue Ivywood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 586<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/02 7:28:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re.</span><hr size=1>  A full install is ALWAYS better than an upgrade.., upgrades dont clean the 'trash'.<br><br>and WinME just plain SUCKS!!<br><br><br>anyways, you installed another vid card?

Sure they appear to work for a while, but starting with a POS OS, then loading another version of the same POS OS can't be good for anything. If you're looking for pure speed out of a machine, you'd be foolish to think you'll get it out of an upgraded OS. The registry bloat alone from these upgrades is enough to send most techies into fits.<br><br>Has anyone here ever experienced a MS Exchange upgrade? Those have to be the worst possible nights anyone can ever spend. I consulted for a company recently that was interested in an in-place upgrade of their Exchange system, which I fought tooth and nail. We ended up calling Dell (their server supplier) and they supplied two brand new servers free for two months to get us through the upgrade. The Dell representative had about ten thousand horror stories of MS product updates, and explained that most suppliers would rather loan you servers to do clean installs on than have you upgrade in place and call them for support. From what he was saying Compaq had leveraged several thousand servers for those companies moving from NT 4.0 to 2000 not long ago, even though MS claimed that it was a seamless process. Even the hardware manufacturers laugh at that line of BS from MS.<br><br>Also, moving from an OS with no real ability to handle IRQ's well to an OS with integrated steering doesn't seem like it would do much to help. If the problem is in fact an IRQ issue the BIOS probably won't do much to help it. Once WindowsXP decides to put everything on IRQ9, after-the-fact BIOS tweaking is pretty much a dry hump.<br><br>I still think that the best course of action in this case would be to back up the data and do a clean install. If the problem persists then you can start chasing it down in a cleaner environment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udarueivywood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darue Ivywood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 587<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/02 9:29:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10169.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re..oops</span><hr size=1> uh yea, what Kerryn said.<br><br>Vid Drivers AFTER DirectX.
