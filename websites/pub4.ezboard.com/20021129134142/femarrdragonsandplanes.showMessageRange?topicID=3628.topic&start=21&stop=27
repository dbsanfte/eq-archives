I had a run in with the &quot; SoW plz&quot; mentality the other day...unusual for me as being a pally my buffs aren't usually in high demand.  <br>
Running through Highpass I get a blind tell from some 20ish monk saying &quot;Come to orcs and buff my group&quot;<br>
<br>
No please, no thank you...just an outright demand.<br>
<br>
All he got was the answer &quot;Re-arrange these words into a well known phrase or saying.........off, fvck&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh and a wave as I ran past him on my way out.<br>
<br>
If being an enchie, shaman, druid or wizard (insert class with highly desirable spell) is like this all the time I want to thank Verant for keeping all my good spells self only.  I can only imagine what it would be like in ME or Guk if Instrument of Nife was castable on others <p><center><img src="http://ri.poweredbyevil.com/guru.jpg"><br>

<br>
It would hoever be nice if those asking could be a little more polite then:<br>
<br>
&quot;C3 plz!&quot;<br>
&quot;Donating for c3&quot;<br>
&quot;C3plz!, will donate&quot;<br>
&quot;paying &lt;x amount of pp&gt; for c3 pls!&quot;<br>
<br>
There is also the dreaded<br>
<br>
&quot;Can i ask for a favor?&quot;<br>
<br>
which usually ends with them wanting me to go several zones away just to c3 someone<br>
<br>
<br>
Instead try putting a little effort in the request.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you be so kind as to ... ?&quot;<br>
&quot;could you please ... ?&quot;<br>
<br>
spell out the words. do not use &quot;u, r, 4, pls, plz, etc&quot;. It will just make me cringe.<br>
<br>
do not mention the words donating or paying. I am NOT a whore selling myself.<br>
<br>
Ask me nicely and i might do it. and i do not want to get paid to do it. it's only mana.<br>
<br>
Another fun thing i saw is when i was browing bazaar. i had a bunch of ppl demand c3 from me, with not moving and no reply, they sat down and camped me until i moved, to send their barrage of tells again. and this was not some 2-3 mins i stood still. i was motionless for a good 15-20 mins and they still were there.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's very easy to ignore ppl. but have you ever run thru nexus as a level 60 enchanter?. you'll get flooded with tells, and those chasing you, pressing &quot;Hail, Katty&quot; like mad to try make me stop. And omg if you stop once. they will mob you, and compete who can open trade window the fastest.<br>

<br>
Enchies KEI<br>
Wizards TL<br>
Clerics Rez<br>
Druids Sow<br>

Its your job. Ya don't like it? Play a different class. Me being a wizard, I have absolutely no problem TL'ing people, and I never have and never will charge for it.  Why? Its my job.  Im sure ya freaking out on some cleric for asking for c3 will get ya a no rez later in the game. What goes around comes around in this game.<br>
<br>
If I am busy I ignore people... they understand.  Enchanters ignore me sometimes when I ask for c3... I understand.  I also have no problem tossing some non-uberguild enchanter 500pp sitting in nexus trying to pay off the price of the spell.<br>

<br>
It is your fellow chanters that sit in there offering to do kei for donations that are dooming the rest of you.  But I think there were beggers before there were people out there offering it for plat.  KEI is a great benifit to me as a cleric I will pay people for it.  I wait for someone to offer they are selling it.  I don't /who enchanter all and go begging though.  <br>
<br>
The people that zone into the nexus and then start &quot;oocing c3 plz or ne1 casting c3 ?&quot; then spaming the zone with it four or five times even when a chanter offered to do it in ooc or shout four times since they zoned in they keep on with thier ooc whining annoy me.  Oh well  such is the nature of the beast.  <br>
<br>
I hate people that demand aego like its thier personal right.  It costs chanters mana.  It costs me several peridots to cast group aego and yet I am expected to use my guild provided peridots to buff newbie_234098234089 for free.  I think not go away begger.  <br>

1.  ‘C3 or speed or spd’ --  demand…bleh!        <br>
2.  ‘C3 or Speed plz’ -- most are very busy with what they are doing and are polite in asking so it really does not bother me<br>
3.  ‘San, speed please’ -- Oooo they used my name!!!  Wow! This nearly always makes me wiggle!  (I nearly flip when a stranger actually uses my name in a tell….’Sancerre, would you mind casting C3?’… it’s just so rare.)<br>
Affliction has wonderfully silly and many polite people who ask for buffs.  Most would make me laugh because they would toss in a dance or ask for it in a silly way or some such nonsense or say thank you after I buffed them.   It felt, yes felt… wonderful and I felt a part of the whole, as I was helping and not taken for granted.   <br>
<br>
The same applies to outside our guilds.  Most do not want to buff YOU, if you are rude, demand or expect to be buffed or take for granted…<br>
   <br>
Would you ask nicely and politely?  This would be lovely if people took that extra time to add PLEASE at the end or a smiley face or something…Pleasant and nice.<br>
<br>
This next comment may date me or just prove that I am very uncool, but the highschool’ish or college’ish, (geek speak??) sorry…it appears to be something very young people do or very lazy people however, using that lazy typing style does make me go bleh, and I tend to be drawn to others who use a full sentence with words spelt out, but it is the least of my concerns as long as they are polite.   Some have given me hugs or a kneel (I strongly dislike that emote…kneel), a smile a wave afterwards etc…but I do not expect to be thanked; it is just very nice when it happens. <br>
<br>
I have never charged for any buffs, nor have I accepted donations.  Not with Breeze, Clarity, C2 or with KeI.   I don’t mind if people offer to pay as so many others, in EQ, demand to be paid for their buffs and people are used to having to pay, (something that baffles me as it IS ONLY MANA and at the very worst our time is taken up for a few seconds).  Each person has their reasons for wanting a donation so I can’t stand here and judge them, but I do not think it is bad if they ask, nor do I think they are ‘whoring’ /cringes<br>
I think I may have misunderstood Cattie’s initial post, as I thought she was calling those who cast freely….whores.  /cringes again<br>
<br>
Do I ignore?   I do not always put up my afk tag so I am sure it appears that I am ignoring, but I try not too.  If I am busy and cannot cast I let them know politely  <br>
Do I go to where that person is located to buff them?  Rarely.  If they would like a buff then they can find me =)   <br>
<br>
As a side note. <br>
I remember what it was like to have a buff when I was little. I was one of those who never asked for buffs so when someone higher up run by and tossed on some nummy stuff…. It was great!  It is one of the reasons I love buffing in newbie zones, or anywhere or anyone, because I can remember how very much it helped me. <br>
<br>
Now with that all said.  I myself have not experienced too many rude and unkind people in EQ. None stand out in my mind.  For the most part, people are very sweet and thankful and in the end, it is not so much what they do, or how they ask or act or if they do not even say thank you.  <br>
My main concern is how I respond to them.  I cannot demand respect if I do not give or show respect.<br>
