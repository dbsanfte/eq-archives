Dragons take time. If you are not ready for an extended raid / prep you should have never agree'd to go. I think three or four people just left after the ice giants were dead. They were looking for replacements that took time. That is the biggest reason Giants started respawning on the raid. <br>
<br>
2.) &lt;--- Pulled corpses from under Vox's Feet. I grabed the nearest corpse and basicly send player X a tell /consent me. I pulled monkeys I pulled clerics, I pulled everybody that I saw. And yes also died grabing corpses. I came back and started pulling more bodies. A few people had a guildmate bring up a coffin and summon their body. That was an option that you choose not to explore. If you got your body back and got all your gear and lost some experience you should be happy. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry to say I will go on a Dragon Raids again but nothing that will be a pickup. I was with the same leaders the previous night and we killed Naggy with some deaths but Naggy went down. It was pre-planed and everybody on the raid accepted the raid as what it is. Dragon Raids takes time you need to be ready to plan on 5 hours for a dragon raid. I was up until 7am GMT pulling corpes and I had to skip out on work today because I was pulling bodies. <br>

The prep went normal and everyone got their stuff.  We were given directions in chat, loot order was thrown out, we charged in and started beating Vox down but we just didn't make it by a thread (from what I heard at least, but I don't think Moltaenya would make that up).  Don't call Moltaenya a bad raid leader just because we tried and failed.  I've been on lots of experienced raid leader raids that have been real rocky before I chose to log.<br>
<br>
And what I call Tuasai an idiot for is for when she screamed &quot;GEEZ THANKS I CANT GET EXP BACK!&quot; when she checked her corpse.  She sounded like such a red-faced screaming kid with tears coming out of her eyes like she's trying to get something, and then post here complaining some more.  Like she's trying to rub the pain and grief of the whole damn raid in Moltaenya's face because it wasn't a success just to get something out of it.  Experience gain is not your significant other, get it through your head.  It's not important enough to whine and grow a diaper with.  I was there for 12+ hours sticking it out with Moltaenya and her friends who started the raid from the very beginning.  I was there when there were buffs, in fact I was one of the buffers.  I was there when we fought and died, and I was there when we had corpse recovery.  I also spent another 30 minutes to an hour or so moving my characters around from Velious to Permafrost to get my corpse back.  This went from around 2pm-3:30am central.  Along with that I also lost a half bubble of exp in level 52.  Tell me, should I put on a diaper, suck my thumb, and bitch and whine like a baby, too?  Hell no, but I guess not everyone can take shit as much as me.<br>

So being on Moltaenya was the best - especially when there were no TPs in CoM (where I was bound) or in EJ.  Want to know I what did?  I grabbed my 52 wizard that was fully equipped.  I told my group I was, I told the other raid leaders I was and that they should let everyone else know too.  I sent tells to those people I wanted to help me on the CR with my wizard.  When I reached Perma I shouted it a few times.  <br>
<br>
Zel got out his enchanter and did a money transfer from earlier (actually, I was going to buy my rebreathers for my epic before I got tells for Vox, but was too encumbered to hold the cash and run through WK that I gave it to Zel's alter).  I took the  cash with my wizard and BOUGHT COFFINS.  <br>
<br>
Being the leader that I was I had already told a few people on the raid that since a CR was MY responsibility, I would use MY cash to buy coffins.  Anyhow, if you're really that pissed that I &quot;bailed with Moltaenya&quot; and that I was such a poor leader and couldn't do anything, fine.  I guess you ARE right though, sitting on my ass or running around looking for a naked TP the majority of the time not having ANY clue what was going on with my fellow raiders.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, you didn't help rez, you didn't offer to do a DA suicide run like a few others who had this ability did, you sat and whined.<br>
<br>
And yes, even before the buffline, I had said SEVERAL times that casters should have bound at the zone (I even emphasized it when the mistimed IGs that another non raid group had before started repopping near the hall).  No death loops right?<br>
<br>
Like I stated in my post under Dragons and Planes, I said there were a few bad peeps out there, I suppose you wanted to reveal yourself huh?<br>

Tuasai, you were the first person I put on my ignore list.<br>

Especially when it's in as remote an area as permafrost?  Why should the leader have had to tell you to bind?  I've never seen Naggy or Vox, but I think even I would have known to do that without being told.  How on earth did you manage 45 levels without thinking to do that on your own?  Do you expect your group leaders to tell you when to heal, as well?<br>

In fact, this entire post is entirely invalid and let me explain why.<br>
<br>
You came in while we were in buff hall. You were NOT there for the numerous hassles and stresses caused by all three of our enchanters leaving, you were not there to see 2 people badmouthing the raid because they expected it to be a 20 minute ordeal.  You werent there when a primary cleric left either.  In fact, you came at buff time.  Why?  Because under her leadership she kept over 4 groups of people there motivated to slay vox and to have the patience to wait out for a proper raid.   <br>
<br>
If you got mad because you died against a mob that takes a raid to take out, go play carebears, they dont die.  Vox was down to 20%, Chealed, whent down to 5% and would have died with any sort of luck.  <br>
<br>
You claim you dont know Permafrost?  Well Kemidra put it well that if you dont know a zone, and theres a chance you should die, well bind there.  Is it that inconvient to get a port back and run a few zones later to rebind where you were, instead of risking not being there like she told everyone to?  Your fault.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing you also didnt knew that unlike Nagafen, those Ice Giants respawn a lot faster.  That means that during that CR we needed people to take down an entire repop.  And during that time we had a druid(who apologized so Im not naming him here) wander around and aggro Vox's guards thus mutilating the entire CR team which is one of the reasons it took so long.  You also didnt know that we pulled all those goblins because everyone was cranky,  hell I fell off my chairing laughing at seeing about 40 goblins die to an AoE, it sure made people lighten up a little.<br>
<br>
So I guess what I am saying is... you know nothing.  You werent there to see any of the stress, you werent there to help with CR, and you werent bright enough to bind at the zone(even after she mentioned a zillion times to do it).<br>

Tip: to level faster, avoid pick-up raids, in fact in the time you spent on this raid you could have easily made two or three yellows in the Kings room in Sol b or lower guk. Level to 50-52 THEN play with the dragons all you want.<br>

NO ONE COMMUNICATE to the masses all huddled alone in FV (as I was). <br>
IF it was Zel's responsability to share with his team that you were switching chars, of course he could have shared with his own group that he was switching chars too, then I'm sorry, perhaps I went a bit overboard on YOU specifically.<br>
 Certainly you should not have to /tell EVERYONE but someone should have told us what was happening.<br>
 I had zone so I thought MAYBE I missed something, but NO ONE I talked to on the way to permafrost knew you OR he had switched char! So we are all thinking great FFA cr!<br>
<br>
I admit we did good while we lived! It was a GREAT group of people we had, but I THINK alot of people lost ALOT more then they should have due to lack of communication from the group leaders atleast, if not the top dog.<br>
<br>
<br>
COMMUNICATION!<br>
<br>
<br>
I have done pick up dragon raids that were successful (and even a few unsuccessful ones) and ALWAYS knew what was going on with rezes and CRs. AND WHERE (or who) the leader (this goes for group leaders too!) was. THIS was the first where I had NO CLUE til I got back into the zone.<br>
<br>
<br>
But as for binding, um no I did not know that and neither did the shammy that showed up with me, he fell in the bear pits (HIS BAD and he knows it! LOL) and had to Gate, but made it back in time! THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME IN PERMAFROST except for a guild event in which we went after the Arceologist, and THAT was around level 25! <br>
<br>
And IF you read my post the leaders name is in it, but I may have been a little hard on her, IT can be hard to keep track of EVERYONE! <br>
