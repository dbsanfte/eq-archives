Play around with different drivers/OS's and you will come to the same conclusion.<br>

I have never had one problem with Windows 98 in 3 years of using it. I used to build systems and write web pages for a living and in years I had one issue that I thought was a Windows problem and within 30 Seconds of me picking up the phone I was speaking to an operator who was aware of the problem, knew what was causing the fault and where to direct me. It turnd out to be a chipset on a soundcard that did not function with a shared .dll  Turned out to be the sound card manufacturers at fault.<br>
<br>
That said I do not hear one person saying &quot;Whoa, give Microsoft a chance, what you expect them to right a decent operating system&quot;   The answer is hell yes, I do expect them to right a decent program.<br>
<br>
You're seriously trying to tell me that 80% of the EQ player base has something wrong with their hardware, that just happens to work fine with every other game they play?<br>
<br>
Or is is that EQ is not tolerant with a minor fault? <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

So the problem wasn't with Windows it was the hardware or the installation of the hardware that was causing a problem with Windows.(yes this is obvious I just want to set the stage for later)<br>
<br>
Now we have the newest EQ expansion, and yes there are some actual programming issues, i.e. bard songs.  However all the people complaining about crashing and lagginess etc, all seem to have one or more things in common.  Hardware that doesn't meet the minimum specs or is not installed according to minimum specs, or an unsupported or incorrectly installed OS.  I am sure there are a couple of other things too.<br>
<br>
Now my machine meets the minimum specs and except for increased zoning times, and lag in the crowded zones(which has been happening in all zones since I started playing) I can play with all the new models turned on.  I can fight, I can explore the new zones, I have not been disconnected since I installed the expansion on Tuesday night.(Knock on wood)  I have also spoken to numerous people who can do this as well.  In fact my brother has been playing the expansion with an on board video card and only 320 MB RAM with no real problems, except that he is a bard and he can't use all the new models.<br>
<br>
I have also spoken to people who had problems patching, logging in, getting disconnected constantly, who once they got some advice on how to correctly install their video cards, or which drivers to use were able to play.<br>
<br>
See the connection between your only Windows problem that you used to illustrate that it wasn't Windows? <p><IMG SRC="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief/kragarn01.jpg"><br>

I did not buy the expansion because I in no way, shape, or form can run it on this PC, most likely ever.  The amount of money I would spend upgrading is enough that it almost makes sense to buy a new PC.<br>
<br>
I naively (apparently) asssumed that not buying the expansion would allow me to keep having the same quality of play, at least relatively, that I had had before it was released.  Instead, on a system that ran EQ perfectly fine up until the Luclin release, I have had four days of hardware and software conflicts, that continue as we speak.  I am beginning to consider things such as consistently being able to log on, zoning in under 10 minutes, or move through heavily PC populated areas in zones luxuries that my PC can no longer provide.<br>
<br>
All personal beefs aside with Verant for making the new minimum specs so astronomically higher aside, I think its a pretty shitty thing to do to raise the specs on pre-SoL EQ.  A large portion of dedicated players who are not power gamers who can afford to spend a ton of money upgrading their PCs did not buy Luclin for the simple reason they cannot run it.  If I COULD run it, I would.  I didn't purchase it because I wanted to be able to play EQ without my PC combusting, and it seems like Verant has pretty much decided to piss on those without high end systems, with or without Luclin.<br>
<br>
It is ridiculous that I am now having problems with a piece of software I do not even own, IMHO. <p><center>Malevant Faeshadow<br>Speedbump<br> <br> Officer of the Free Company<br><IMG SRC="http://www.unicorntrad.org/three.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 508<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/7/01 8:36:06 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.ulujain.org/albums/album02/aar.thumb.jpg width=90 height=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The TRUE reason people are having problems with SoL</span><hr size=1> If people moved to a stable OS...have Verant ported EQ to Solaris or Linux?<br>

There are tons of problems with folks that meet and exceed the recommended specs, much less the required ones.  Me, for example.  Here's my box:<br>
<br>
Win98 SE<br>
GeForceII Ti 64Megs<br>
SB Live Value<br>
256 Megs Ram<br>
PII 400<br>
DX 8.1<br>
Cable Modem<br>
Most up to date drivers.<br>
Everything installed correctly.<br>
<br>
That set up meets or exceeds the Recommended Specs as listed.  Even with that, I can't load half the character models without killing my performance even more.  I'm not a computer junkie like so many around here, but I'm reasonably competent.  I assembled the system I'm using now, and have had a home computer since 1979.<br>
<br>
But, with all that, I am getting horrid lag (not associated with zone traffic), over a minute to zone, 3-5 minutes to switch toons, delays every time I open up a new interface, and I crash every third or fourth time I zone.<br>
<br>
Back before the revamping of Verant's official boards, I was a well-known VAK (the title was never really earned for I was always critical of some of VI's lamer decisions, but would defend them on occasion, too).  This release was just plain idiotic.  They succumbed to marketting pressure to get SOL on the stands before Christmas and not too long after the release of DAoC.  That is unforgiveable in my book.  We're all beta testing EQ again, which sucks.  I have neither the time nor the interest in doing so.<br>

<br>
Running a p3 450 with a tnt2 card, no luclin, with SBLive and 512 ram.  I am not looking at the new models, but performance is roughly similar to what I had before the patches.  I do notice longer zone times (between 1 and 2 minutes).<br>
<br>
Sometimes upgrading the video card is not the solution.  Putting a G2 or G3 in a P2 systems still handicaps yourself at the processor level, even though your card is top notch. <p>Tanuden <BR>

You'd need a PIII and 512 megs of RAM to meet the specs.  Your proc and memory are just barely enough to meet the minimum requirements as listed on the bottom of the box. <p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mlaye" target="_blank">

The only difference is our systems or they way they are set-up.<br>
<br>
I agree with you 100% about us having to be paying beta testers though.  I mean how hard would it have been to have someone log in as each class/race and try a few things, like fighting a battle and zoning a few times??  I am just trying to point out that most of the complaining that is going on can be solved by figuring out the tricks of configuring everyone's personal systems.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of tricks that I have read about so far:<br>
<br>
Going into the eq.ini file and setting TNLuse=False.<br>
There was one about datarate too and making sure you have the correct setting for your connection method, i.e. dial up, cable, T1.<br>
Some of the &quot;newest&quot; drivers are not the ones you want.  This of course is rather stoopid on Verants part, but again it's something having to do with your(this is a general &quot;your&quot; btw) system config.<br>
Also wasn't there something about getting a detonator driver for your video card?<br>
<br>
This stuff I have picked up just skimming some of the more well known boards.(SafeHouse, Druid's Grove, this board)  I haven't been looking either since I haven't been having troubles that I am worried about fixing yet as I am chalking them up to the regular EQ expansion issues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/useann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/7/01 12:41:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The TRUE reason people are having problems with SoL</span><hr size=1> [quote]<br>
