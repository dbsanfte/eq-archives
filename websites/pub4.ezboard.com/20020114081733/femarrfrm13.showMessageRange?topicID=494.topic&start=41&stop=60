If you go back and read Vec's post he plainly states he wasn't going to dump anyone who stuck with us through the first floor.<br>
<br>
We had 31people up there with about 12 or so more that wanted to come up...he got 5 or 6 more in and ran outta room.  Vec didn't want to do more than 36...I don't blame him..36 is overboard as is.  <br>
<br>
Next time you lead a 36 man pick up raid to a plane, do ALL the groups, and pull at the same time...let me know.<br>
<br>
Kudos to you Vec for once again pulling to the level that you can. <br>

Of the 5 people who posted here who said they would be able to come in on the seconds wave why were there FOUR people told that they could not attend when they showed up at 4 o'clock for the second wave? Some people change schedules or sleeping habits to attend raids and to be signed up for one and turned away with the LAME ASS excuse of no more hate stones when you SPECIFICALLY stated in your opening post that the Hate Stones would be taken care of by you. Also when this was addressed to you Vecartibus you told the people at the spire (Me, Banisher, gwaenavie, and Flintik.) to talk to Matik. When i sent a tell to Matik to talk to him about it this was my response. &quot;No we have no more room. Don't talk to me.&quot; Obviously a very diplomatic choice to handle this situation if I must say so myself. I then told Matik to tell you what I think of this and he told me to tell you myself and he logged as at that time I don't think he had it in himself to do anything constructive. After this I sent you a tell thanking you for wasteing my time in having a second wave when you really had no intention of having any one port up besides your guildies who had logged on and wanted to tag along. After a bit of talking to you I decided to just leave the spire and start going about my business and then I get a tell from you which again I found insulting. You sent me a tell saying if we got a stone you would port &quot;THREE&quot; (The three was capitalized in his tell as well as here) up to Hate. Sounds lame to ruin four peoples times and plans and then to only offer to get three of them up to Hate. So i decided I didn't think I wanted to go anyway so I told you to get the other three up there so their plans wouldn't be completely wasted as I had no real desire to go up there and help you aquire anything you would want after the way it had been handled. So in conclusion you run a pretty poorly planned raid without a whole lot of thought into it. I must say that if I invited people to a raid and i ended up with more people than I wanted then I would just deal with the influx and have a larger raid. Just my 2cp's <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udarkbindress1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkbindress1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/7/01 3:34:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: **Updated**2 part HATE raid (Tue, 7 Aug - 7AM/4PM CST)</span><hr size=1> Hey, at least now we won't have to worry about seeing you on one of our raids eh?<br>

Yea, sounds real lame Vec, you asshole, to try and get 3 of the 4 people up.  I mean, that is actually just &quot;insulting&quot;.  <br>

I'm here to tell you pal that the next time I want a port to hate and you tell ME that I can only have 3 of my 4 friends come up then, then, then, I'm just going to write a real long post about how lame you are Mr. Vecartibus Ancanthopis.<br>

I mean people change around all kinds of &quot;stuff&quot; in there lives to attend these raids Banisher signed up a week in advance and gets told he can't go cause a couple of guild friends said they want to go at the last second.  Adarian wasted 10 hours of his day to go to this. I waited there myself for on the portal for 2 hours waiting for this thinking all happy oh i might get some &quot;phat l3wt&quot;. I was talking to a couple guild members of the eternal haven i asked them if they were going to the hate raid on the 2nd wave and they replied yes.about 30 mins later around 4PM EST (3PM CST an hout before it's suppose to start) Cal the wizzie comes down and ports them up.im now sitting there with just adarian on the portal. I then give you, Vecartibus, a tell asking if the 2nd wave was still on and you replied &quot;yes...in about 20 mins Ill see what we got.&quot;well next time i see the wizard come down to take ,what was suppose to be the 2nd wave, up. but instead he takes all his &quot;guildies&quot; up and leaves the rest of us who actually signed for this thing and spent lots of time to make it. So next time you plan a raid on here please post, &quot;Notice:My guild will be picked first.&quot; that way we know this is gonna happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uadariansilverthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adarian Silverthorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/7/01 4:34:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: **Updated**2 part HATE raid (Tue, 7 Aug - 7AM/4PM CST)</span><hr size=1> 1.)

A pick up thing.  Signing up does not guarantee you will get to go.  This was not an EH raid, nore were EH member's favored over any non EH members.  So your whole  claim that he left ppl out to have guildies in is poorly chosen.  We ported up with at least 6 guildies who signed up on our board for this raid.  We brought no more then that to replace those on the second wave.  We left out guild clerics, enchanters, and shaman's because there were plenty up there at the time.  Hmm how odd if there was some alternative motive here we would have brought those up.  <br>
<br>
Anyone who leads, plans, directs, researches a large raid can tell you that you dont please everyone.  Its impossible.  Its imperative to the raids progress to bring classes up that are needed for the raid.  I mean c'mon its common sense that if you have 6 warriors in the zone and only 2 clerics, your not going to chose another 2 warriors because they &quot;signed up&quot;.  You make do with what you have, while trying to avoid wipe outs.  <br>
<br>
You can flame Vec all you want, but if your one who goes on pick up raids alot I would be careful.  Know what you are talking about first, because Vec is a guy who plans and leads mainly pick up raids.  Why?  Because he loves the planes.  He enjoys watching ppl get upgrades, while he does what he loves the most, pulling.  He does this for YOU.  For a pick up raid.  For ppl who dont have large guilds and cant do it themselves.  He eats cost on theese raids, he eats death multiple times on theese things.   He has a large following of ppl, and most are considerate enough to know you dont always get in on everything.  Sometimes things just dont work out as planend.  You go on living.  Get over it!<br>

<br>
I am sure Vec will post when the raid is over and answer for himself.  I wanted to say on his behalf that he worked really hard on that raid.  Out of the 36 ppl there only 13 were Eternal.  Which probably more then half had been there since the moment we ported up.<br>
<br>
I wont pretend to say I know how you feel about waiting cause after an hour I wouldnt have waited anymore.  The second wave recruits was more or less out of Vecs hands.  We took over forming groups for him so he could focus on pulling.  ALOT of ppl had told us that if Banisher came (because of rep) they would leave.  So we made the decision that he would not be allowed to come up on this raid.<br>
<br>
I think Vec didnt relize so many ppl would want to stay for the second wave. Hence the reason he planned on a second wave.  Vec could have planned an Eternal only raid, we have the numbers but he likes to include more then just &quot;guild&quot; on his raids.  He spent 2400pp on Hate Stones and I cant begin to tell you how much exp he lost with his pulling deaths, but he didnt complain once.<br>
<br>
I am truely sorry your day didnt work out, I am but please dont try and flame a good person for having a hard day in a very hard zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Trilok Izgawd<br>

Vec was not aware that Banisher is not looked upon favorably by many members of our guild, including myself.  If you want to flame anyone for him not being included it might as well be me, because I am the one who told Vec that he was a loot whore who should not be trusted.  I was aware of Banisher's loot whoring in OS and I was not about to let him get a ride to Hate, especially when my wizard was doing the porting.  Maybe he should not roll on items that he only has the intention of selling when it is a NBG group.  <br>
  Banisher did not fit the description of the people that we were taking up with us, if you read his first post I think it says something about not taking up anyone that was a complete tool. <br>
  I do feel bad though, someone should have told him that we were not going to take a loot whore along.  I mean, look at all the time he could have been pharming OS while he was waiting for a port up.<br>

Would you look at that! Half our force was missing. Thats 16 out of 34 people that didnt turn up. Maybe thats why there were different people there? Because the plans had to change because others couldnt/didnt make it.<br>
<br>
Just because the list is posted on the board, doesnt mean that it is set in stone. When you are running a raid, you work to the needs of your raid <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> to the moment</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. You need an enchanter, they get priority. You ned a cleric, they get priority. You need porters, they get priority. You need shaman, they get priority. You see how this is going? We needed certain classes and they filled up slots since other classes didnt leave. Therefore, no room for you.<br>
<br>
Vecartibus bought hate stones. But there were a lot of other arrivals BEFORE the 2nd wave. He can hardly buy enough to bring up 200 people now can he? That would be just unfair on him and his wallet.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also when this was addressed to you Vecartibus you told the people at the spire (Me, Banisher, gwaenavie, and Flintik.)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So in conclusion you run a pretty poorly planned raid without a whole lot of thought into it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, ran fairly smoothly once everyone got the idea.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I must say that if I invited people to a raid and i ended up with more people than I wanted then I would just deal with the influx and have a larger raid. Just my 2cp's<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Every raid where they do that, ends up badly. Either with people dying, or people complaining about mobs/loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uenterzone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enterzone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/7/01 10:47:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Nice job</span><hr size=1> /agree Sharasali.<br>

The GOODness that we all experienced will be forthcoming when I can get some rest.<br>
<br>
I'm going to say ONE thing up front.  Adarian mentioned HIM helping ME get something I want from the RAID.  FYI Adarian, as Fiesti put it VERY well . . . I RAID and pull BECAUSE I like to see others Whoop it up when they see their loot drop.  I don't need ANY armor from HATE/FEAR/PoG(well--arms maybe)... and I raid there CONSTANTLY!  <br>
<br>
Why???  For OTHERs . . . YES, you may have trouble w/that concept Adarian, but it's REAL and other people believe in that principle too!<br>
<br>
(1) Adarian: I think you were behaving like a complete jackass.  People who know me KNOW what kind of person I am and I don't throw insults around lightly.  <br>
<br>
YOU were the one being TOTALLY disrespectful and acting very foolishly!  DID you sign up--YES!  Did I post a list--YES!  EVERYONE on my list (who showed up) was Guaranteed a spot.  THAT--is how you select a pickup group.  I've signed up for MANY P/U raids and if a list isn't posted... I MAY or MAY not be chosen... Those are the facts!<br>
<br>
MY LIST was golden and I specifically stated I'd take NO MORE than 36 and that I had a FEW signed up already (guildees).  NEVER in my most wildest plans would I have THOUGHT we'd have 31 people STILL on the RAID at &quot;shift change&quot;.  <br>
<br>
We DID port up 4 of my guildees and 1 non-guildee in the shift change--ONE guildee was a substitute Wizzy and the other a Chanter.  The other 2 had notified me of wanting to be on the raid before I even posted it.  I stick FIRMLY by my decision NOT to get more than 36 ppl in a plane raid.  MOST would agree w/me.<br>
<br>
Shortly after your &quot;tantrum&quot; I actually offered you a spot in the raid (we lost 3 ppl unexpectedly).  At that time, yes, I felt badly for not getting you up there.  Your attitude when you responded back was insulting and childish.  I did  my best to accomodate you.  <br>
<br>
(2) Flintik: Wow!  I can't remember more than a couple tells from you... I'm very surprised to see you flaming like this!  No, I don't know you . . . which makes it even worse.  <br>
<br>
I don't doubt you gave me tell SEVERAL times which I didn't catch.  Those who've led raids KNOW how innundated w/tells a leader is.  <br>
<br>
As far as you &quot;commanding me&quot; to NOT POST A RAID FOR MY friends on the board again... go to hell!  MOST of my friends aren't IN my guild.  ALL my guildees are friends... but I raid w/several different groups, so F.O.A.D... when you think you can tell me what I can and can't post &quot;for my friends&quot;.<br>
<br>
(3) FOR all those WHO waited (other than Adarian and Flintik), I DO apologize for not getting you in the raid.  I appreciate your understanding and knowledge of how these things work.  Next time, I'll simply list a start time for my raid and then just solicit for fill-ins w/maybe an estimated time (although that's VERY close to EXACTLY what I did w/this one)<br>
<br>
One thing I've always been afraid of with flaming (although I never have) on these message boards is the fact I MIGHT just be flaming some 10 - 11 year old kid.  I'd feel HORRIBLE if I actually berated someone who was JUST acting their age.<br>
<br>
Adarian/Flintik . . . if this is the case w/you, I'm truly sorry and I feel AWFUL.<br>
<br>
TOMORROW: <br>
<br>
I'll post the LOOT (well Sharasali will) and let you know exactly what went down (mobwise)... We learned some INTERESTING things about the top floor, btw... will be useful next time.<br>

We can be fairly certain that day time raids will be relativily free of these kinds of bitch sessions. Vecartibus I would like to offer my condolences on having such a great raid &quot; Heard second hand &quot; tarnished by having to deal with morons that have obviously not raided much. <br>
<br>
Personally I feel that ignore is not used often enough by most raid leaders. Normally when leading dragon or plane raids I have to remove a few people from my ignore list so that the newest crop of WHINING ASSHOLES will fit.<br>
<br>
I dont think you should apoligize to the kids by the way. Kids that act like adults would not be caught dead acting in such a childish manner, they normally have a better grasp of the needs of the whole over the wants of the one. <br>
<br>
I am sure we will see you in the planes again soon.  <br>
