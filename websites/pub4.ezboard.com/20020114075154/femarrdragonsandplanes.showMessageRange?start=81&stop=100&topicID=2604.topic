If this is indeed the case, then DG drops from being malicious and falls squarely into the &quot;Stupid&quot; section.<br>
<br>
  Why would you do a CR in N ToV why another guild was in HoT and not warn them?  The aggro range on those wyverns is HUGE.  I checked them incidentally when I was in HoT after the carnage... they'd returned to their static points, so it's unliklely in the extreme that they'd stand around for the couple of hours you talk about Araniel.  Possible, certainly... their pathing is screwed when outside N ToV for sure.  But from what I've seen moving around inside N ToV they're pretty good as long as they don't get outside the doors.<br>
<br>
  OK.  I'm willing to accept it might have been a complete cock-up on DG's part.  However, could you please do me a favor?<br>
<br>
  If I'm around, and DG needs people CRed, send me a tell.  I'll buy the coffins myself if needed.<br>

<br>
US, MSF, and Magister all talk to each other. If we have something planned we talk to the other guild so they know. If there is a disagreement, something is worked out. That is why you don't see flames between those guilds. DG, on the other hand, refuses to work in this system. They want to kill what they want to kill and to hell with everyone else. I have been told that in no way, shape, or form will they work with my guild and that we can have Dozekar when they get done with it. If you, as a guild, picked one person to talk instead of all your officers being on different pages(trust me, trying to get a statement from DG as a guild is impossible, every officer has a different opinion and they are all on even footing, so a decision is basically impossible to get from them), then you could simply tell the other 3 big guilds and we'd work out a time for you to get a shot at the mob you want. This works for any mob with a set timer.  Instead you choose to hoard one mob per patch and whine about how you're time differential is such a horrible thing. I tell you one thing, I wish we had our peak time when 80% of the server was asleep and we could pick and choose a mob to lock down every patch day. Instead of this stupid hoarding get off your high horse and work with the other people you compete with. It makes things a lot simpler for everybody.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uojuillean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ojuillean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 722<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 1:52:38 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.afflictionguild.com/media/users/Ojuillean/Raidfood.jpg height=106, width=125></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: question</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is just as messy as murdering someone &amp; leaving a bloody glove at the scene.

Breus, knowing you as I do, had this been a thread about you I’d be here backing you up, no matter the case against you, because I trust your basic decency. Despite not being present I’d vouch for your standards any day – see how that works?<br>
<br>
<br>
Instead, I’ve stated I trust the decency of players who are my guildmates. You can’t be in a guild, hear the guildsay and not know what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour. In fact, in many ways I don’t think you really know a guild until you have done this. <br>
<br>
<br>
At no point do I say DG haven’t caused UI’s problems and again I’ll say I’m sorry for them - what I stated was it couldn’t (despite the damming discussion) be intentional.<br>

But it doesn’t matter what I say does it? <br>

I was not there in ToV on that night or even logged on Everquest for that matter, so I don't really know the whole story about what happened on that night. However, after reading through several of these posts it has become clear to me that UI seems to claim that Divine Grace is &quot;hogging&quot; Dozekar and not giving many others a shot at it.<br>
<br>
Being a mostly Asian based guild, we don't have the opportunity to do Statue, Zlandicar, or other numerous mobs that are basically handled by EST and PST guilds such as Magister, MS, SF, and UI. I'm sorry if we do Dozekar, which is pretty much the only nice mob that we have an opportunity to kill when our majority of members are on. <br>
<br>
As for you, Bubu, Divine &quot;Disgrace&quot;,as you claim us to be, does not go publicly ranting when mistakes are made. If i remember correctly, you trained DG in Kael and I have witnessed several UI members myself opening doors on us in ToV without inquiring first if it was safe. <br>
<br>
PS. Bubu, it also does not help when you publicly state on your own message board that DG &quot;seems not to speak any Language known to man.&quot; Being pissed because you simply don't get the satisfaction of killing one damn mob in Everquest, does not mean you go and make statements that we can't speak english. I found this offensive and just wrong. I don't recall us ever posting anything on our message board about other guilds. You've gone way too low and are a bit pathetic if you have to resort to making fun of other guilds on your own message board, joking or not. I don't give a shit...<br>

<br>
Having said that, I'll say this:  DG, you were wrong.  I won't even go into whether or not it was intentional.  I could argue either side of the events from what I read here, but I wasn't actually there.  But, you were wrong.<br>
<br>
Intentionally or unintentionally, UI was trained by members of your guild while in the middle of a big fight causing a big CR.  Then they were trained again while in the middle of CR.  Then, they were basically told to fuck off by one of your officers (who SHOULD have control over the guildmembers there, btw).  If it was an accident, fine.  Shit happens, nothing you can do about what's already happened.  BUT, you could have offered to help them in the retrieval of their corpses or at the very LEAST apologized.  It doesn't matter what has happened in the past between your two guilds, it doesn't matter the belligerence in their tone of voice (they were mad, wouldn't you be?),  you messed up, you should have tried to help fix it. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

<br>
Perhaps after you remove your piss poor officer (duh) the rest of your players can actually enjoy this game and work something out here.<br>
<br>
Wether it was intentional or not it was done it is already proven.  To say your guild is incapable of anyhting is fooking dumb.  You dont know your guildmates.  Let me repeat YOU DONT KNOW YOUR GUILDMATES, even in RL you dont know what another person will do so to say that in a online game is dumb.<br>
<br>
I for one am actually surprised this happened, i know UI and DG have been having problems over Doze cuase i had to put up with ppl complaining about it for a while.  But to train.....well heh i dont even know what to say it is just funny and sad at the same time.<br>

<br>
Yes we have been. Like any &quot;end-game&quot; big guild we hunger to kill big mobs, or we just get bored with EQ and quit for DAoC or whatever. As Seliak mentioned, however, Doze is really the only &quot;juicy&quot; mob that we consistantly find up, so when we do find it up, we try to kill it. Sure, after any given server patch we could go kill other big mobs that spawn at patch, but the only others that many guildies still need loot from are VS and Trak, but we only kill a small portion of these 2 mobs due to a deal we are a part of with 15 or so other big guilds of EMarr.<br>

Gilgamel, thanks for your recent post, I honestly did not know that. I really do hope that all you say about interguild relations are true. I challenged you on this because I did not think that such harmony was the norm among the big guilds, thinking you would back down - instead it seems that I have instead shown my ignorance - which is Ok to me since I walk away learning something. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ok, so the next time Mag or SF is buffing for, say, Kland, Zland, or Tormax, I (figuratively me, actually DG will send a representative with authority) should ask them to pass on it and let us kill it when we get enough people on? Shouldn't we have something to offer them in return? Sorry if this sounds sarcastic, but this is more or less how you approached DG, and you added lots of threats and insults and stuck around to bother us. Seriously though, beyond all that, I think it would be great if we pass on (say) Doze one day but UI, Mag, SF, and Aff all agree to let (say) Zlandicar live so that DG can have a go at them during our prime time (pretty much as your post describes, if I read it correctly). I will now work within DG so that we too can be a productive part of this harmonic process, as it seems to benefit everybody.<br>
<br>
<br>
Issue 2: DG fucking up UI's Doze fight<br>
<br>
The facts as they are:<br>
<br>
A DG guy opened the door to NToV while UI was in HoT. He was killed quickly just south of the door, and 2 NToV wyverns also stayed on the South side of the door.<br>
<br>
Golgar and Blazestorm joked about training UI in say at zone in with a UI guy right there.<br>
<br>
As UI was fighting Doze and Gailen stood outside the HoT, the door to HoT opened and center area mobs aggrod UI.<br>
<br>
UI was not happy about this turn of events and confronted Golgar, a DG officer, who in turn responded confrontationally rather than appologetically.<br>
<br>
NToV mobs aggrod on UI as they were undergoing their CR the bulk of their raid force (and incedentally also on DG as they attempted to CR Gailen).<br>
<br>
Now given all that, the obvious conclusion is that DG conspired to purposefully repeatedly train UI and prevent them from killing Doze. I can totally understand how UI and most people who read this board came to that conclusion, and I know that if the positions were reversed, we would be damn pissed at UI. But as it turns out, I also know for a fact that this was not a purposeful train by DG - the problem is that I know my guildmates and I know in my heart that they couldn't do this, but don't have screenshots to prove this.<br>
<br>
I now see that Gailen denies even opening the door, and I believe that 100%. It's possible that CoV mobs happened to pick that moment to aggro KoS UI player(s) inside HoT and opened the door themselves (I have seen some screwy stuff like that in there, and tried to find who to yell at for opening the door and found nobody). It's possible that a UI player inside ToV got dangerously close to the door and/or accidentally opened it. It's possible that Gailen accidentally opened the door somehow without even realizing it. I know full well that all such explanations do sound extremely unlikely, but Gailen lying sounds far less likely to me.<br>
<br>
So, at the very least, we screwed up by even being there so that we could be blamed. And for not warning UI about the NToV mobs that we accidentally released (but I agree with that guy who said he found it hard to believe they stayed out there that long - I didn't even begin to think that it would be a problem later, but live and learn, now I know better). And the jokes about training proved to be in very bad form in hindsight after all this shit happened - I agree that it sure makes DG look guilty as hell. And personally I don't think that Golgar's confrontational reaction in OOC or on this board did anybody any good and should be apologized for - even though he was pissed because he knew the accusations of intentional training were false, he should have seen how UI could reach that conclusion and reacted constructively. He said he does not &quot;control&quot; all guildies meaning that he did not &quot;order&quot; Gailen to train UI, but everybody is right in that as an officer he does bear some responsibility, for punishment (if necessasary) after the fact if nothing else.<br>
<br>
And again, I don't know who's CR efforts aggrod those NToV mobs first, UI's or DG's, from all I heard it still could have been either, but it's our fault they were there even if we assumed they were long gone.<br>
<br>
However, it is kinda funny to me that people who know Gailen are so ready to believe that he obviously became demonspew after joining DG. No way was Gailen &quot;ordered&quot; to train UI. Even if you don't believe that, you have to know that no way would he even think of carrying out such an evil order. Seriously. Before I just assumed that maybe Gailen had a serious brain fart and opened the door to run into HoT to track things for a second or something, but now I see that he denies opening the door, so I believe him 100% (can't rule out the extremely small chance that he somehow clicked on it accidentally without even knowing, though).<br>
<br>
<br>
     So my facts are:<br>
<br>
DG somehow unintentionally hurt UI to some degree. It's just plain wrong.<br>
<br>
Nobody in DG intentionally trained UI. Yes I do know this for a fact, no matter how much you say I don't know Gailen and my other guildies.<br>
<br>
True that DG should have offered to help UI CR, but note that according to Yaara, DG could not handle our own CR (she had to eventually rez Gailen) so it seems like that this wan't an option.<br>
<br>

Yaara,<br>
People in DG know to not drag corpses in zones like ToV. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Unless FD. Maybe somebody somehow fucked up, or FD failed or something, if it was DG who generated aggro while CRing Gailen. I was hoping Gailen's corpse move thing might clear something up, but nevermind. Oh, we did have a cleric there when I was on, he must have either logged temporarily to return when needed, or was dead at the time, I don't know. Anyway, that was a total class act rezzing Gailen after he maliciously trained you (at least I don't think you had any reason to think otherwise at the time), so thanks!<br>
<br>
<br>
Breus,<br>
Laugh at our charter if you must, but know that we really believe that shit.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think just quoting Bul here gets the point across, they have every right to bitch at you because your hypocrites.&quot;<br>
I have no idea what you are talking about here. Who has hypocrites?<br>
<br>
&quot;Melkizedek...Yeah all the expierences I've had with Gilgamel have been much the same...less the harrassment...name calling...and the other lies you felt you needed to include here.&quot;<br>
Hmmm, well, let me think. Not that I will comment on whether he was wrong or right, but maybe he was a little angry at the times that Melk referenced. Geez man, he made it no secret, to DG anyway, that he really wanted UI to kill Doze and was really upset with us for killing Doze again. If you can't believe Melk, can you at least see evidence of his desire for Doze and anger at DG for &quot;hording&quot; Doze in any of hist posts here? Come on, he only mentioned it 56 times, hardly a secret still. Not that this is relevant to anything, I just got miffed because somebody called Melk a liar. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And as you said:<br>
<br>
&quot;'People do weird things when they are angry. Just because you all think he is a top notch guy, doesn't make him incapable of doing this.' Melkore...I think Melkore makes a valid point, people change and loot corrupts&quot;<br>
<br>
Which led Gilgamel to the state that Melk described (justified or no, I won't judge).<br>
<br>
&quot;Coroq...Gailen has fought in HoT...he knows what happens when you open that door, think maybe possibly he could've done it on /gasp purpose?&quot;<br>
<br>
/gasp No I still don't. I still don't know what the hell Gailen had to be angry about at the time in the 1st place. Bored maybe, but I don't even see a source for this theorized anger. I personally know that Gailen doesn't give a flying fuck about Dozekar loot, so discount that a source. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushadoabackripper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadoa Backripper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 5:50:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> DG Blows</span><hr size=1> This thread makes me giggle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvalricentreri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valric Entreri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 234<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/30/01 5:55:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I did not want to get involved with this..</span><hr size=1> With all due respects to both sides...<br>
<br>
This is getting blown out of proportion. It's no lie UI hates DG. Mainly because of the poor quality of Gilgamel's idea on getting DG to give up a Doze spawn. UI has some very cool people. Heya Rae! Heya Roggo! I've talked with Gilgamel a few times doesn't seem that bad. Just the way he tries to get DG to release Doze is what tends to make DG ignore him.<br>
<br>
It is sad to CR's like this. Especially with NToV corpse camping mobs from hell. But the fact is it was truely a mistake. Yes, as stupid as it was it was an accident on a CR of our own. <br>
<br>
The mobs where pulled to the north wing doors on an accidental CR. Lafarnir is a cool guy, plays an enchie very well. English skills are not the greatest and he does not know everything in this game. Hardly anyone knows everything. I've seen countless times that UI/RoD open HoT doors when we where in there. They look at US raid times, see 12 DG in zone, open the door and think nothing of it. It's an *honest* mistake that people make. <br>
<br>
I totally understand UI thinking DG did this on purpose. But in commonsense Golgar is a smart guy. And he's very, very funny. Check out our main page to get a taste of his humor. www.divinegrace.de He *WAS* joking around when he said that on purpose right in front of a UI member, looking directly at him. <br>
<br>
All I ask is you all relax a bit, give DG a chance and just don't read the main page and say wtf! DG's a bunch of assholes. Golgar may have said that in OOC, and being at the zone in he may have not seen waht went on. But getting 100's of tells from a series of 30 or whatever pissed of UI members who believe the training was on purpose would tend to drive a man upset. Best way to get his point across and you all to leave him be for a moment is an OOC saying STFU. <br>
<br>
If you really want to resolve this, and truly care for peace in the upper game just chill out. Don't come crying everytime something happens. Becuase it may very well be an accident, such as this. Just sit down, have a talk with some of the DG officers. Discuss Doze, discuss whatever. Just the point here is to DISCUSS. And no, Gilgamel did not try to discuss. He tried to verbally assault to get Doze left for you. That doesn't work to often =/<br>
<br>
Continueing this here will resolve nothing. =(<br>
<br>
Thanks for your understanding UI and all you others, have fun in game guys!<br>

Yes, we all fuck up, but DG seems to piss someone off every two months or so.  It's a trend and a poor one.  Every time someone from DG comes to the board and says it won't happen again, and then two months later it does.<br>

<br>
 When UI made their first, and only attempt at Tormax, Magister had people online and ready to kill him(on the way to kael? not sure..) and we simply asked, and they let us have a shot at him.  We tried, we failed, they killed him.  No harm done in asking.<br>
<br>
As far as what DG did or did not do..  Sure its possible that it was all an accident, they didnt mean to train us..  But after seeing Khorn's screenshot of Golgar saying &quot;Nah just train 2 Ntov wyverns on them&quot; and then (you guessed it) 2 Ntov wyverns mirraculously appearing, it leads one to beleive otherwise.<br>
<br>
As far as why Golgar would talk about training UI right in front of one of there members, maybe, as said above Golgar is retarted.  Or maybe Khorn was hiding &gt;&lt; why would he do that tho..<br>
