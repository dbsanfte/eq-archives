<br>
AF jobs that translate well to civilian careers ... I have seen about 3 so far ... I'm sure there's more.<br>
<br>
The recruiter is going to push Security Forces on you.  He/She has a lot of quotas to fill there.  The guys I knew in SF all get out after 4 years for jobs in law enforcement.  It's practically a sure thing that a job as a cop is waiting for you if you keep a clean record.  The SF guys I knew were happy with it for the most part, and there's some comraderie there, that I have seen.  My personal advice to you is only take this option if you're interested in a law enforcement career.  The hours you work are long, odd hours, and alot of the time you'll be bored on watch.  If it's something you're not interested in, you won't be very happy.  Remember, when the recruiter pushes this on you, you don't have to take it.<br>
<br>
I'm a 3COX1 (Computer Operator), and I do Network Architecture, Systems Administration, Web Development (and more) ... Eventually, I'll probably have all the skills I need for an MSE certification.  I work steady hours, and have time for college courses.  I've seen a few guys get out after 4 years to take jobs at places like Compaq doing Sys Admin work on Web Servers.  We're a critical field, high enlistment/reenlistment bonuses.  I really like/recommend this field, and I'd suggest holding out for it.  I had to wait 3 months from the time I approached the  recruiter til the time I shipped out to get it.  Hold out for the career you want ... don't settle, and don't go open/general.<br>
<br>
I've seen that Air Traffic Control was another good job that has a civilian career waiting, as well.<br>
<br>
Oh, you can also go into Medical ... and have a career that translates well into medical administration, nursing, dental assistant ... or with your degree, anything you want in the medical world.<br>
<br>
Speaking of jobs, if I don't get going now, I'll be late getting to post.<br>
<br>
Best of luck,<br>

If there are only 3 billets open only 3 people are going to advance. And then it is the best test scores and evals that fight for them.<br>
<br>
There are some rates that almost everyone who takes them advances, but then there are some that only 2% of the people taking the test make it.<br>
<br>
I came into the Navy as an E-3, made E-4 4 months later and then took my first E-5 exam 3 months later. This is not common, but it can happen. However the possiblity of making E-5 was slim to none and so I took the test a few times. The reason for not making E-5 right away was that if I had re-enlisted for 2 more years I would have made a nice bonus 40kish, and E-5 automatically. Well you can imagine how many people DID re-enlist, so that cut the avalible billets way down for those of us who didn't re-enlist. (Just so no one jumps on this. I was a nuclear EM and I didnt like the job, so I didn't want to spend 2 more years doing it)<br>
<br>
Last I heard the Signing bouns for Nukes was up to 15k. With the star program getting as high a 45k for another 2 years and auto rank to E-5. (Remeber your bonus is taxed at 32%) You however don't get the bonus unless you pass your school. Which is almost 2years long in CHarleston, SC. So that is a 2 year wait on the 15k, it is taxed all to hell and if you don't pass you don't get it. Also the 45k star bonus is divided up in that when you sign you get half of it and then the rest is spread out over the course of your enlistment. So if you hvae 6 years left on your term, you will recieve 1/6th of it every October. And again it is taxed at 32%.<br>
<br>
This is the same for all signing bonuses. You only get them if you finish the school or term you agreed to. I don't know about other schools, but NUKE school was very hard and I saw a lot of friends get kicked out, or decide they didn't want to be there and got themself kicked out. Also my captian was a hard ass and if you went to Captians Mast you were lucky to keep the program.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking of going NUKE in the Navy feel free to drop me a line. I can also point you to about 15 other NUKE's on E-Marr in the 3 different ratings.<br>
<br>
As far as the GI Bill. You will be a fool not to take it. You only pay $100 a month for a year and when you get out you have enough to get a BA in almost any feild. If you are going to be a doctor or lawyer you won't, but you know how that goes. I am not sure you can get a signing bonus and the College fund, I am pretty sure it is an either or. ASK! That is the biggest thing, if you don't know or aren't sure ask.<br>

<br>
Kidin, as far as talking to the Navy recruiter, I'm not sure yet. I've been looking at some jobs in the Navy, the Arts and Photography really interests me, esp. the photojournalist. The student loan repayment offers and continueing education after enlistment options look really good too, as well as the traveling aspects. <br>
<br>
Going from a civilian life to a military life isn't going to be easy. I realize this. Living on a sub/carrier and leaving the States for months at a time has it pros and cons. At this point in time I'm not too sure how adjusted I'll be to that sort of living. I also am not sure how I'll adjust to living totally on my own. Granted, I did live a year in a dorm room at college, it's not quite as shell-shocking as moving away and living on a military base.  <br>
<br>
To tell you the truth I don't know what'd I'd be able to do with my free time or if I'd have free time at all. Who knows? I'd most likely just stay in my room attempting to play online video games. :P <br>
<br>
I was checking out the US AF,Army,Navy websites and found their careers section. There are a ton of them. I went through every single one and read the details/info. But, I want to get more info, behind the scenes info on the jobs, I'd like to get other people's takes on these jobs:<br>
<br>
(Air Force)<br>
Public Affairs Apprentice<br>
Still Photography Apprentice<br>
Aerial Gunner<br>
<br>
(Navy)<br>
Photojournalist<br>
<br>
(Army) <br>
Multimedia Illustrator<br>
Journalist/Broadcastjournalist<br>
<br>
As you can tell...I'm looking more in the PR sectors of jobs in the military. Getting down and dirty whether fighting or fixing things aren't my thing. Secretarial jobs filing papers and checking on needed base materials just sounds too boring. I should look more into computer technical jobs, but I like performing computer things more of as a hobby and I don't think I'd enjoy it as a job. <br>
<br>
I took the ASVAB about 3 years ago (Spring 99'), I've forgotten the actual date. Will I have to take it again? My last score was a 73, but I know I'm capable of getting a better score. In fact, I'm probably going to get one of those ASVAB 'help' books to help me study for it if I need to re-take it. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advanced to people who help me get a clearer image of the military. Thanks again to those who have already helped. <br>

 You might have to take the ASVAB again and, if you think you can score better, you can take it again anyway.<br>
<br>
 I don't know a whole lot about the JO(Navy Journalist rate) field but I did know the one we had on our ship and he seemed to enjoy his job.<br>
<br>
 If you decide to go in the computer field the two rates to try for in the Navy are IT(Information Technician) and CTO(Cryptologic Technician(Communications). While other rates in the Navy do have some network administrators jobs, these two carry the lion's share of them. IT requires a Secret clearance while CTO requires a Top Secret. Your expunged record might be a problem acquiring a Top Secret clearance.<br>
The Navy has several schools in the computer field. Ones to look for are 2735(Information Systems Administrator), 2780(Network Security Vulnerability Technician) and 2781(Advanced Network Analyst). These three schools are good schools and produced a very good reenlistment bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
My job before this one in Hawaii I worked with USAF guys. They have a pretty good deal and if you don't want to move around a lot, it seems that the Air Force will leave you in one place for a long time(one guy I worked with had been at the command for 9 years!). The Air Force has some of the best housing among the services.  But Air Force also seems to take the longest to advance.<br>
<br>
Take a look at all the services(including Coast Guard!) and ask a lot of questions. Don't let the recruiter drive the conversation. Remain noncommital, ask all the questions you want to know, and if it sounds like he/she is bs'ing you, leave and go to another office. Usually the services recruitment offices are located right next to each other so when they see you talking to the other services they tend to be more honest and less pushy with you.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about the Navy, computer fields in the Navy, or anything about the military feel free to drop me a line at damojoogre@yahoo.com. If I don't have the answer I can usually track down someone who does.<br>

<br>
I as well am a Navy Nuke (MM2/SS) serving onboard a King's Bay boomer.  From what I have seen, i'll agree to most of the above posts about the military being a complete change of pace, and of lifestyle that is sometimes rough to get a hold on.  For you, do realize that you won't be serving on any submarines, but mostly surface ships and shore commands.  Submarines are small enough for the people we carry on them now, that we assign collateral duties to members of the crew for jobs such as what you are looking into (photo | PR | etc. ).<br>
<br>
Keep an open mind, and yes.. motrin does seem to be the root of all that is holy in military medicine =\.. that and foot powder.<br>
<br>
Make your decisions smartly, and you will perservere.<br>
<br>
Also, most ships (surf) are equipped with satellite relay classrooms, and most of those are free, where you can further / complete a degree if you wish.<br>
<br>
So i guess skimmers do have it a bit better.... sun (what's that), school, women, naaaahhhh nm that.. i wouldn't serve on a surface ship if they tripled my salary.  That's too much work.<br>
<br>
Take it as you will.  The military isn't for everyone, but for some, it's the open door to their future.<br>
<br>
Good Luck to you<br>

<br>
When I mentioned my friend the recruiter, it wasn't to have you go in his office.  It was just so you'd have access (IN game even <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) to someone who has recently been IN the fleet AND knows all the latest things that recruiters can offer (bonuses, college fund, how tight which ratings are, etc) without any of the pressure (real or perceived) of actually being in a recruiting office.  He's a good guy, even if he can never settle down to ONE character to play, lol.<br>
<br>
If sea duty makes you a little wary, I'd recommend the Air Force for Quality of Life.  I don't recommend the Coast Guard (those guys are so short-handed, they are ALWAYS going out to sea AND they do some dangerous stuff in the War on Drugs) or the Marines (unless you are really gung-ho and in teriffic shape).  I am not knowledgable enough to speak for or against the Army/Air National Guard, but I knew it wasn't for me.<br>
<br>
Just like Kintai said, if you are interested in photography and journalism, if you go to a submarine, you may be able to volunteer yourself to become the Ship's Photographer.  (Though that violates a basic Navy principle...Never Again Volunteer Yourself, which I've never managed to follow!)  You could also assist the Supply Officer, who doubles as the ship's Public Affairs officer. On my last 2 boats, this was a collateral duty for a junior E-5 or a hot-running E-4.  The Navy sent them to school, and then they took all the official (and tons of unofficial) pictures for the command.<br>
<br>
In all my time on subs, I've never fired a shot in anger in 11 years.  That includes Desert Storm and the current war.  Submarines are about the safest place to be in the Navy.  <br>
<br>
Every Journalist or Photographer's Mate (different jobs, though JO's can take pics too) I've known has really liked his job, though their field is rather slow to promote.  My JO friend who was a JO1 (E-6) jokingly would say the only way he'd make Chief (E-7) was if he killed his own boss to get the billet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You've heard from several Navy &quot;nukes&quot;.  These are smart guys.  Listen to 'em.  I have noticed a larger number of nuclear trained Navy guys who play EQ over any other rating.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    (What that means, I'll let you decide.)  If you do go &quot;nuke&quot; and make it through the schools, you have the chance to make some serious cash over and above your basic pay, especially if you make the Navy a career.  I wouldn't want their job for an extra $500 a month myself, but it may be something that interests you.  <br>
<br>
A little more about the computer fields.  Sonar Technicians and Fire Control Technicians on fast attack submarines (&amp; FT's on boomers) are the ones who go to school to become LAN administrators for the computers on the subs.  This is on top of the electronics training for their respective fields.  One thing to note though, that these schools aren't offered to everyone.  The boats pick who they send, and the electronics schools may require you to re-enlist. <br>
<br>
This is some SERIOUS training here.  Up to and including Advance Network Analysis, a school that costs about 10K by itself to attend, and the Navy sends you free after you finish your other schools.  You could receive about 100K in training for no cost to you while receiving an okay paycheck.<br>
<br>
A 73 on the AFQT is a good score, but you may want to try again to make sure you qualify for any program you are interested in.  (The AFQT is just one section of the ASVAB, and it gives you a percentile score.  The other sections give a numerical score, but they aren't percentile based.)  Ask the recruiters if a 73 is good enough to qualify you for the programs you are interested in.<br>
<br>
The websites are a great research tool.  Play it cautious and continue to gather information before making a decision.  What you are doing is smart.<br>
<br>
Good Luck,<br>

<br>
You will have to take your ASVAB again, it is only good for a year. 73 is a good score and you should be able to do most jobs that you want. The thing with your score is the higher you get the more jobs you can do. The max you can get is a 99 and the min you can get to qualify to be in the military is a 32, except the Army. I hear they wavier stupid people as low as a 20. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
JO isn't that high up on the military list, so I bet you could get in with a 73 easy.<br>
<br>
Nukes are 85+? and then a follow up test.<br>
DT (dental tech's) are a 32<br>
MS (cooks) are around a 37<br>
<br>
if that gives you any idea about the silly scores. I don't see what the big deal is, the test isn't hard and just because you score a 92 (which is what I got) doesn't make you smart (cause i sure don't feel it).<br>
<br>
As for nukes playing EQ--I know that there were a bunch of us in nuke school that started playing and then got our firends playing. I wouldn't have started playing if it wasn't for Aennar (the real Gannon at the time) and Weegit. They are the ones I started talking to about gaming when we should have been studying. But also we are a very computer related rate and may people have their own computers and interets in gamin before we joined the Navy. So for the earlier comment of &quot;if you like EQ you won't like the military&quot; you are way wrong. There are tons of military people who play. I saw a friend log in and he was in Guam and having withdrawls on a deployment.<br>

That's tough shit man, getting hit in the face in a practice run, but then again, the rangers are hard-core kick ass. <p><br>Shnarf <br><i>"A Million bleeding hearts, composing prose in blood, to live and die a thousand times."<i><br>

I had a doctor's appointment today and was prescribed a drug for an ailment I've been suffering for the past 8 yrs. Nothing serious but the prescription medication is going to cause fatigue and body aches. I have to take the prescription for 4-6 months, which is okay I guess, it makes deciding on where to go with my life a lot easier because I won't have any time restraints <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't want to go into basic training while on this medication, I think it'll be too much for me to handle. For now, I'm just going to chill at home play EQ/CS maybe take a vacation and absorb/enjoy everything civilian life can offer. After that, hopefully I'll have gained and researched enough about the military to know which branch/job I want to get involved with. <br>
<br>
It somewhat makes me feel regretfull that I did withdraw from college, seeing as I won't be joining the military untill possibly half a year...but so goes life, decisions which always make me think of regret and not reasons for why I chose the direction I choose. /shrug<br>
<br>
Thank you all again for the replies! I'm in a toss up between the Navy and Air Force as of right now, looking into PR or photojournalism as a career. <br>
<br>
To think that I would have gathered this much needed advice and information from a Everquest message board still astounds me. I can't thank you all enough. <br>
<br>
I'm going to place this post in my favorites folder and refer back to it when the time comes again for me to do even more research. I might be emailing some of those who have left their email addresses on this post to inquire more about whatever they talked about. <br>

The reason I ask is, I have a drug charge that needs clearance. Also, I realize that not every recruiter wants me, in fact I know I'll have a problem with finding a recruiter that will take his/her time in seeking clearance for me. I had this problem the last time I wanted to enlist. It's also one of the reasons why I never enlisted before, because the recruiter told me that I should just wait a year until the file clears...which in the words of some on this board is BS because the government will find it out eventually...<br>

<br>
Go ahead and talk to a recruiter now, even if you don't want to go until the end of summer.  Expect to get pressured into taking the physical (which usually ends up in joining).  So if you go just let them know you are only looking.  They will still pressure you though, LOL.<br>
<br>
As far as the USAF goes...  avoid aerial gunner.  The only gunners left flying currently are the Spec Ops gunships and helos.  If you go for that you can expect to be away from home frequently and you will go to survival school (which involves getting the crap beat out of you in the POW part).<br>
<br>
Public Affairs or Combat Camera are decent career fields but not in high demand so you may have a difficult time getting a slot.<br>
<br>
Think on this.  I am in Intelligence.  Office job mostly, I do a lot of public speaking and on the spot thinking.  If you can survive the security clearance process you will definately get in as we need people badly in the career field.  Initial signing bonuses are good.  My first enlistment ends next week.  6 years down.  I am going to sign up for another 6 years.  Why?  Because my re-enlistment bonus is $59,400.00   I also enjoy my job.  I get to see and do things that no one else outside of the military ever gets to do.  I get to plan and see operations go off that you see on CNN weeks later.  The down side is that it can be very stressful, just ask anyone in my guild about my mood when getting home from work some days.  <br>
<br>
I'm currently deployed away from home again or I'd ask you to contact me IG to try to answer any other questions you may have.  Good luck with your decision. <p><font color=b041ff><center><strong><i>Egat Bearskinner</i></strong></center><BR>
