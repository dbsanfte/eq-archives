I am not going to name names or single anyone out yet, because it pertains to more than one person. My gripe is this people wanting to buy my gear while i am camping something or even during pulls. As a bard songweaving is very important in my combat effectiveness and its hard enough keeping up with them spam let alone trying to juggle tells on &quot;give ya 200 for the dagger d00d&quot;.<br>
I even get people in my group asking to see my weapons or armor after the pull is called. I thought people might get a little better at the game past level 20 but i seem to be running into more and more of these people. <br>
    First of all if I sell you my weapon I can't really camp this now can I? So yes you may be offering me more than it is worth but I don't really want to have to head back to ec just to get another weapon. If you want a better weapon YOU go to get one. I am not gonna lose a good group or camp for a small profit. More annoyingly is the scenario when someone comes up to me in the middle of a pull and wants to haggle for armor. Sorry I don't carry spare on me and I am not gonna ignore my group in the midst of combat just so you can complete your set of lambent or singing steel no matter how much you are offering. Even better is when i mention to them that I won't have a weapon they try to trade there crappier weapon for mine. Wow so I can get my money back for this and another pos I can't unload on anyone while trying to buy a weapon that I want. Perhaps I am too willing to discuss how i aqcuired my items I dunno, but just because I got a helluva deal on my ss gaunts or boots or my sword does not mean I will sell to you for twice that amount. I don't want the money. Hell I hate trying to get new items in game. More than likely when I upgrade I will just sell at cost to someone who needs it and it definately will not be during camps. Please tell me that this stuff doesn't go on in the lvls ahead of me. <br>

I credit this partially to being a caster where unless they inspect I have like 3 visible pieces of equipment.  I also credit it to having equipment appropriate to my level.  I wore raw silk until low teens, advisors to mid 20s, oracle robe to mid 40s, crystalline to for a bit, an SMR for a short while before getting my apothic.  As you mention Singing Steel and level 20 in the same post...I am wondering if you are heavily twinked?  If so, that might be the problem...people are seeing stuff obviously better than what they have ever seen and want it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If that's the case then I'm afraid hot key might have to be your answer until you catch up with the &quot;level&quot; of your gear.<br>

I may start being more reluctant to let people just inspect me to or look at stuff while I am busy. When i was a newbie I used to wonder why some people got pissy about being inspected now i know why I think. A question though, would a /tell %T key work? May have to try it. Yeah I think it probably is worse for me being hybrid mellee. <br>
    I have another question, what exactly is a twink? I was always under the assumption that it was someone who had gear they didn't earn. I have paid for all my gear that i have now (well accept for two pieces of armor that a friend lent me that really aren't that high gear and which I never get asked about ironically) My goal throughout the teen lvls was to raise 1k seemed like alot back then. I started my halfelf out in qeynos and ran to ef as soon as I got the heal song. I levelled off nothing but bears pretty much till i got no xp from them. Whenever somebody auctioned a Hq bearskin I would offer them 25 plat while telling them standard price was 30. To many people the money then was important so they took the small profit loss for better gear sooner but i saved and always banked for the ig campers. I saved and saved then one day I lost my body do to some bug while zoning couldn't find it on either side with my corpse locate song. Being as I was midteen I decided it really wouldn't be worth it to whine to a gm so i rebuilt from patched leather. Then I banked out and sold all my bearskins. went to ec with 750ish plat. I zone in and see a lambent bp for 750. I bought a tentacle whip off a merchant for 1 plat and went back to work. I feel really lucky to have gotten the deals i have gotten and thank all the people who were so nice. I really don't want to sound like a tool who thinks his shit is to good for other people, I just wanted people to realize there are times for things and it should be obvious I would think that when camping probably isn't a good time, especially considering the manner in which some of these people handle themselves. If they sent a tell expressing interest and would want to set up a time to discuss it I would be very willing to talk. I am lvl 30(like a blue away) and I have two pieces of singing steel that i bought from a monk who let me short him 8 plat and i gave him a stack of hot spicy toelings to cover the loss. The other I got from a guildie and friend who held it for me till I could raise the money. <br>
Still Rambling past my bed time and i hafta work tonight 8( <br>
well take care and thanks for letting me vent and giving me suggestions.<br>

<br>
Good thing we're already in R&amp;F...hee hee.<br>
<br>
I would define a twink as a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> character</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wearing equipment beyond their ability to get on their own.  So it would be equipment transfered from a higher leveled alternate character or given as a gift by a more affluent friend.<br>
<br>
The &quot;earn&quot; test is a tricky one because it is pretty common for advanced players to give stuff to their new alternate characters.  One could argue that the level 57 warrior earned the crystalline robe she gives her new necrmancer because she did go through the work to have the money to buy or abilities to farm the robe.<br>
<br>
Just as a note...I'm pretty much indifferent to twinking at this point so no insult or criticism was intended. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Salenie Mithrilweaver<BR>Proud Member of <a href=" http://www.clanbattleaxe.com">Clan Battle Axe</a>

okay. i know everyone will whoop and hollar and say its not the same thing, but.. think of it this way.<br>
<br>
in line at the bank, someone see a shirt you're wearing.. they might can or might not know what it is, so instead of asking.. 'hello, may i ask what brand of shirt that is? i've been looking all over for one for my *insert random family type person here*." they just pull down the back of you shirt and look at the tag themselves. doesnt that seem rude to you? i was taught to always ask before i inspected someone, so in turn i appreciate it, if someone asks also. it shows what kind of manners they have.<br>
<br>
ps. go ahead and assume i'm saying you dont have any also :> makes life interesting. <p><center>

answer #3 /ignore, I have to clean out my ignore list fairly often and have no clue why I put 99% of them on it. some might of pissed me off, some I might of been messing with it and it got old and they would not stfu about it. or insane amounts of /ooc /s spam. /ignore em for a day or 2 and the problem is solved<br>

First, set up a /afk message...even though you are not afk. Example...<br>
<br>
/afk Sorry, nothing is for sale or trade!<br>
<br>
Second, work and sweat to continue levelling and upgrade all of your equipment to no drop gear, then sell/trade/give-away all of your droppable gear. This one has worked wonders for me.<br>

On another note, some guy verbally chastised me last week for NOT setting myself to AFK while standing in the EC tunnel.<br>
<br>
I got up for 5 minutes to put laundry in the dryer, come back and scroll up to see if I missed anything good and I see, “wanna sell that spear?” I simply reply, “no”, even though I'm pretty sure the protocol in EC is to /auction what you're selling and not just stand there and let people look over your goods like they’re window shopping. Then he replies back, “you should set yourself to AFK if you aren't at your keyboard dude.” Uhhh, I actually let that one slide... I was so taken back by the comment. I mean, I know I’ve been away from EQ for a while, but in that time I wasn’t aware that setting yourself to AFK was mandatory if you stepped away for over 30-seconds – is it? <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Your not saying anything to him and standing their doing nothing is like putting a rotating car in your window. People expect it all to be for sale. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

I like the new .sig picture by the by. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I have to disagree with you.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There is a difference from the tag scenario and inspecting.  The only intrusion of an inspect is a message on your screen (which you can turn off) vs. someone entering your real life personal space, touching you, etc.  We are not our characters after all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   A better anology would be someone walking around your car taking a good hard look and peering into the windows when you're not there, or slowing down to check out your house as they drive past.<br>
<br>
The real impact on inspection is really a simple question of ettiquette.  Many people (myself included) believe it is a simple courtesy to ask before inspecting.  I heard of this on my first days on EQ and it stuck with me.  I also realize this is a personal preference...like saying &quot;excuse me&quot; after you burp.  It is an point of personal courtesy...and I have long ago given up expecting courtesy online. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As an aside, the reason I get inspected mostly these days is not for equipment (the joys of being caster...only things visible on me are my robe (no drop), my boots (which I have been harassed for in the past...GEBs), and my staff (which looks like a staff of writhing so no one bothers me about it)) but to try and figure out what class I am (I am set /role in game).  For the longest time I would get inspected and then asked for clarity.  So I just put in my character description &quot;No, I am not an enchanter&quot; and that cleared the problem right up and I am rarely asked for clarity anymore. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Unfortunately, apparently I look like a wizard because people are starting to ask me more and more for ports.  /sigh<br>
