EQ History</span><hr size=1> -------------<br><br>Everquest: The Dream<br><br><br><br>The Beginning: A Dream<br>In the beginning there was a team of developers, money behind these developers, but most important a Dream and it was good. A game engine was built that was stable and impressive. A world was created that was innovative and new. The dream came together as a reality. Classes were made that should be able to please anybody who loved &quot;role playing&quot;. Casters were made offensive while lacking defensive. Pure melee were meant to be defensive, while lacking the stunning offense of casters and hybrids were actually useful.<br>And the dev team of VI came together and sayeth unto each other. &quot;It is good&quot;<br><br>The Beginning: Beta<br>The game labeled as everquest, a virtual world was put into beta testing. People who were lucky enough to play the game, despite the bugs, despite the problems knew they were dealing with something that would one day be a legend. The game went through testing, those with the Dream actually listened to their guinea pigs, some changes were made as they tried to anticipate the day it would be released to the public. The emphasis on the game was on the journey 1-50 and role playing. For if everybody role played their classes there would be no problems for classically things seemed to be pretty standard of the concepts agreed upon in classic fantasy. Balance was not essentially an issue because people &quot;should&quot; play what most suited them, and just have fun on the journey and the classes were not really even meant to be balanced.<br>And so sayeth VI unto the masses &quot;We have brought the dream to life and it is good&quot;<br><br>The Beginning: The Golden Days<br>Finally the time came and Everquest was released to the public. Nobody could have really anticipated the effect the game had on what was essentially a raw industry. Its competition UO offered a completely different style of game, one that really offered EQ no competition. People flocked to the virtual world of Norrath, feeling the magic of something they had never before imagined. People started to become addicted. They played the game, participating in the &quot;dream&quot; more then they lived their real life. Money poured into VI and they smiled unto each other and thought &quot;it is good&quot; but alas trouble was on the horizon...<br><br>The Beginning: The Classes that Cried Wolf<br>As the people played Everquest steadily and leveled higher and higher up they began to grow unhappy, feeling thoughts of Jealousy and Envy. And so they sent their plea to those with the Dream and said &quot;why is thou punishing us? Lookest at the Necroeth, he can solo the hardest dungeon in the game how is this fair? And look at the Mageth and Wizardeth, they can lay waste to any creature that opposeth them. And what about the enchanters, they walk unfettered through the land aided by great magic. Even the hybrid are stronger then us and have spells to compliment them. Why hath thou with the Dream shunned the warriors, the rogues, the monks? If you do not make us uber, we shall be forced to abandon our much beloved class and play a necro so that we may be gods as well.&quot; And their cry was heard throughout norrath for many a day.<br>And those with the Dream answered asking &quot;Why can't you just have fun? Is not the experience enough?&quot;<br>And the melee repliethed with a resounding &quot;no&quot;<br>So those with the Dream asked with fear in there voice. &quot;What have we done to displease? You are a fighter you give up the offensive capabilities of a caster, in return for the defensive capabilities of a tanketh&quot;<br>and then the melee replied with &quot;what good is the defensive capabilities, when a necroeth can keep himself from getting hit and unload obscene damage. What good is the defensive when the only important monsters in the game can best be defeated with a strong offense. We are not needed, we are not useful. Do we not deserve to be a part of the Dream?&quot;<br>And so those with the Dream saw this and gulped for it was not good. Their subjects were unhappy, chaos was gripping their Dream, a solution needed to be found for the melee classes were a dying breed, people were flocking to the stronger caster classes. Something drastic needed to be done...<br><br>The Beginning: The Days of Nerf<br>And so those with the dream created a mighty artifact and said, &quot;from this day forth phear the artifact known as the NERF STICK(Note Frightning Epic Sound Effects at this point).<br>And wielding the Nerf Stick those with the Dream began to smite. Necros received the smiting the hardest. Yet still in the Dream things had not yet gone completely out of control. VI began to work at what they hoped would bring happiness to some of the classes, upgrades were received by melee. Sure they could not solo but things were changing on the horizon. Yes the sound of melee rejoicing could be heard throughout norrath and it was &quot;nearly&quot; loud enough to drown out the silently sobbing necro.<br>And those with the Dream smiled for it was good.<br><br>The Beginning: What Iz Zees Uber?<br>Yet all was not well with the Dream. More trouble loomed in the future. Whereas the original foundation of Everquest had been built around the journey and the experience. Those who reached the high levels found themselves without pursuit. They grouped together in large masses to lay waste to Naggy and Vox and Cazic Thule but this was not enough for them. And they made their pleas known once more saying, &quot;we have played your game, fit into your dream but whereth are our rewards? Whereth is the challenge.&quot;<br>And those with the Dream answered with a tentative &quot;in the experience?&quot;<br>And crieth the level 50's &quot;no! we need challenges or else we are done with this silly world and silly game, we will go play Diablo 2 if you do not sate our desires.&quot;<br>And so sighed those with the dream for all was not good.<br><br>Here the Beginning ends, change was on the horizon and nobody could have predicted just how much change.<br>--Somewhere around this point &quot;All Your Base&quot; lived and died--<br><br>The Big Mistake: Lizards?<br>And so announceth those with the Dream. &quot;We shall bring to the masses a world unlike you have ever imagined. It will look nicer, there will be more to do, melee will have disciplines which balance them, there will be better lewtz, 10 more levels, and LIZARDS!!!&quot;<br>And there was much rejoicing throughout Norrath(except for the necroeth who were still weeping)<br>And so worketh day and night did those with the dream slave thinking that soon they would bring peace to the lands, rake in the money and live the good life worshipped as they so deserved.<br>Finally after much work and little testing, they spake unto each other and said. &quot;It is done and it is good&quot;<br><br>The Big Mistake: 10 levels of crap?!<br>And so those with the Dream came unto the masses and said it is done, be at peace for all will now be well. Many people flocked to lizards, while others immediately invaded the shores of Kunark ready to start leveling and killing.<br>At this point in time various things happened...<br><br>A_Bitter_Warrior_02 says &quot;Why are these green creatures kicking the crap out of me?&quot;<br><br>A_Druid_in_Wolform_89 says &quot;what the hell? A huge ass dragon just ate me?&quot;<br><br>A_Soloing_Mage_23 says &quot;I just killed a hundred blue mobs and my yellow bubble didn't move. I think my exp bar is broken!&quot;<br><br>A_Lost_Necro_66 says &quot;errr where the hell am I? Sk-Skiey-Skyfeh-Skyfire? Well guess I'll try my new pet out. *summons pet* Cool it's a rogue! /pet attack. Hmm my pet seems to be broken, he doesn't have any hps... HEY!! HEY!!! Stop that! Ouch! What's going on?! I'm getting summoned! This can't be right, I can't solo this crap!!&quot;<br><br>And those with the Dream who had slowly been growing bitter and tired of the whining smiled at each other and said &quot;This will keep them occupied for awhile,&quot; and it was good.<br><br>The Big Mistake: Pfft Naggy is a Wuss<br>So time continued on. Those with the Dream brandished the Nerf Stick using terror to keep those who would oppose them in submission.<br>Necros cried in a small much humbled voice &quot;umm sir, please, those with the Dream. Our spells don't really land, they kind of suck actually. Soloing in Skyfire would drive the most stable man insane, people don't really like us because we laughed at them in The Beginning and people are telling us to log off because we cause too much lag.<br>And those with the Dream said &quot;Quiet you can solo lguk still!&quot; and smiteth the Necros with the Nerf Stick some more for good measure.<br>Meanwhile the hardcore players, who played for a challenge were finally managing to start killing A_Druid_Eating_Dragon_01 and cries like &quot;Holy Crap this stuff is Uber!&quot; was heard across the land of Kunark in much resounding chorus.<br>Unfortunately not was all well. For those with access to the influx of gear that was so much better then that found in The Beginning, began to return to the old lands and kill mobs that were supposed to be a challenge easier then they might kill A_Moss_Snake. And those with the Dream frowned for they had never meant those encounters to become trivial and all was not good.<br><br>The Big Mistake: The Dark Face of the Trinity<br>In the world of those with the Dream, all was not well. The pressure was becoming greater, the problems more apparent. There was much fighting between those with the Dream, as they disagreed about exactly what the Dream was, and what it was supposed to become. Some couldn't handle it and broke under the pressure, while others wielded the Mighty Nerf Stick in hope of inspiring Terror, where others still cared but slowly felt like they were being buried alive.<br>One thing was agreed upon though. Naggy and Vox needed to be changed, a level cap was placed upon them to stop those with the gear from defeating them.<br>And while many people were still leveling through the 10 levels those with the Dream deemed as fair(though other people called it simply &quot;10 levels of crap&quot;) a dark three sided face had begun to appear in the shadows.<br>Those with the Dream were confused and frightened. What was this three sided face, what did it portend? Where had it come from?<br>Some who had visions of the future cried &quot;Beware the face, for it brings DOOM&quot; but they were mostly labeled as crazy and ignored. The face was frightning, for one side was the face of a Cleric! One side the face of a Warrior! and one side the face of an Enchanter!<br>These were the classes that were being used. These were the classes deemed important, and necessary. Who knew how far it would go?<br>Those with the Dream shook in fear, for all was not well.<br><br>The Big Mistake: We Get Sparklies<br>The masses began to rise up against those with the Dream. They were arguing back, shouting even and the Mighty Artifact known as the Nerf Stick was no longer keeping them opressed.<br>Those with the Dream had to do something and they had to do something fast or else all would be lost.<br>And so they created the Epic Quests and said unto the people &quot;Are we not good? Do we not take care of our people? Look what we have done. We have given you sparklies. Now go out and be happy.&quot;<br>And there was much rejoicing as people started to work on their Sparkle Sticks.<br><br>A_Epic_Mage says &quot;OMG OMG OMG OMG! JOBANER YOU ROCK MY WORLD&quot;<br><br>A_Excited_Warrior says &quot;pshzwap... Luke I am your father!&quot;<br><br>A_Rogue_Twink_Lvl4 says &quot;sweet I got my Ragebringer!&quot;<br><br>A_Paladin_Lvl60 says &quot;umm I need a book off Naggy and a book off Vox? What a raw deal! Man I wish I was a rogue&quot;<br><br>A_Bored_Cleric checks the Ragefire rotation and sighs<br><br>A_Humble_Necro says &quot;What the hell? A duck? You've got to be kidding me... ARGHHH *falls back into a state of weeping*&quot;<br><br>The People sedated for a short period of time those with the Dream smiled. For they saw the sparklies and it was good.<br><br>The Big Mistake: It's Working as Intended<br>Unfortunately as with all things time passes, the people grew discontent and once again all was not well. Classes were embroiled in civil war against each other, while trying to appeal to those with the Dream for their benefit.<br>With the new focus on raiding, the grouping used to most efficiently make it through the new levels, and ability to solo guk still around, classes began to point fingers. The original balance in The Beginning was long gone and now some cried out who was better at soloing, who was better at raiding, who was better at grouping. Everybody wanted to know where they now fit into the Dream.<br>They wanted to feel loved too but alas the time for love was long past. Those with the Dream had long since grown bitter and hard. They pointed fingers, defended themselves on every little issue and cried from the Heavens &quot;stfu you guys. It's working as intended!&quot;<br>Yet nobody was happy. Where they had promised balance, they brought imbalance, where they had promised good fair levels, they brough 10 levels of hell with not much in return. The people no longer trusted those with the Dream, those with the Dream were at war with the people.<br>What was worse, was those with the Dream realized that they had created a monster. Things were growing out of hand far faster then they could keep it in line. Something needed to be done, something that would open peoples eyes, make them forget the injustices of the past and bring them to peace once again...<br><br>Here the age of the Big Mistake is nearly ready to pass. The world is at unrest, the classes are confused, chaos sweeps across the land with only the whisper of...<br>A_Evil_Race_11 says &quot;man everything in Kunark gives me negative Venril Sathir faction and now they hate me in my own city. This place sucks&quot;<br><br>--some point in here Server Side filtering was introduced and it was good--<br><br>A Bitterly Cold World: Did You Say a City of Dragons?<br>And so those with the Dream announceth once more &quot;We will bring our people into a new age! A new world, a better world! You will have new possibilities, new opportunities. Balance and challenge, risk vs reward, brilliant battles, innovative ideas. All you've ever wanted and more!&quot;<br>And sayeth the people &quot;umm Ice?&quot;<br>And reassurance those with a Dream &quot;well yeah... but really really cool ice! and a city with Dragons!&quot;<br>And all was well, the people rejoiced once again for it was time for a change, a time of balance and a time of peace.<br>Little did anybody know things would get worse before they would get better...<br><br>A Bitterly Cold World: First Thoughts<br>And so once again in the Tradition of those with the Dream, who wielded the Mighty Nerf Stick once again released a world with little testing but was 100% assuredly &quot;working as intended&quot;<br>Excited by the promises made by those with the dream the people flocked to the cold shores in hopes of finding this bright new world that was promised to them.<br>Immediately cries rung across the lands from the classes...<br><br>A_Lvl60_Warrior_Kunark_Uber says &quot;ouch ouch! what is this thing?! A snow dervish! But I've got my lightsabers... hey stop that! aaahhh a cougar and another Dervish! Not in the Face! Not in the Face!&quot;<br><br>An_Enchanter_Part_of_Trinity says &quot;haha I'll just mez... hmm... I SAID I'll just MEZ thi... ouch! Is this working as intended?&quot;<br><br>A_Hybrid says &quot;am I still useless? Yes? That's it I'm logging on my rogue!&quot;<br><br>A_Lewtz_Druid says &quot;Got my Wakening Land key. Got my Wakening Land key. Gonna port. Gonna port...&quot;<br>LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br>A_Lewtz_Druid says &quot;HAHA very funny guys! First the wolf hating dragon and now this. You guys are bastards!&quot;<br><br>The_2ndto_Last_Necro says &quot;Let me get this straight... I can't summon corpses anywhere except zone lines now but instead to make up for that I get specter illusion which is worse then my Kunark spell? That's it I'm starting a rogue&quot;<br><br>And those with the Vision saw this and smiled. For it was good.<br><br>A Bitterly Cold World: Umm I Think This Dragon's HP Meter is Broken Cause It's Like Not Going Down<br>The people were strong though. They began to assimilate slowly. They saw mobs and sayeth unto themselves &quot;I will defeat that mob, how hard can it be?&quot;<br>So with their groups of people, well equipped in many ways they attacked the different mobs. The different mobs life did not move yet managed to wipe them out. Confusion spread across the land like wildfire. And they spoke out unto those with the Dream saying &quot;Something must be broken cause that thing owned us hard!&quot;<br>But those with the Dream reassured. &quot;Trust us, it's working as intended. Everything is just fine not to mention nicely balanced.&quot;<br>So the people, strong by nature persevered and finally they took down the mob who they thought broken and with great joy looted it.<br>Immediate the cry that echoed throughout the lands was defeaning. &quot;A Cloth Cap?! WTF!!&quot;<br>At this point those with the Dream screamed out &quot;ITS WORKING AS INTENDED!&quot; while brandishing the Mighty Nerf Stick and managed to terrorize the angry masses into temporary submission.<br>At this point it was quite obvious. Those with the Dream had long sunk into the realm of insanity, their world an entity they no longer could control had escaped their grasp while war ripped across the frozen wastelands and all was NOT well.<br><br>A Bitterly Cold World: Balance?<br>Time passed slowly. Velious was alot of things, and that included challenging. It was time consuming and it was difficult. War continued to rage between the clearly mad, those with the Dream and the masses.<br>Slowly but surely mobs thought unbeatable began to fall before the hardcore players. Zones were constantly found that were unfinished. The people cried for justice, and those with the Dream hid in a corner wishing it would all go away.<br>Then somebody spoke up, it was the last straw.<br><br>A_Caster_01 says &quot;is it just me or do casters kinda suck? Our loot kind of sucks, our robes look gay, our spells are useless in Velious unless we're buffing. Where's the balance...?&quot;<br><br>And that was the end of those with the Dream's sanity, They Shouteth unto the world from their perch in the Heavens &quot;You want balance?! You want BALANCE?!! I'll give you GD BALANCE!!!&quot;<br>And with their great power they pointed at the pure casters and cursed them for eternity. And through the thunderous roar and earthquakes that followed all that could be heard was...<br><br>The_Last_Necro sits on a hill watching the destruction with a mad glint in his eyes.<br>The_Last_Necro says &quot;HAHA She said that?!&quot;<br>The_Last_Necro says in a duck voice(lips moving) &quot;Quack!&quot;<br>The_Last_Necro says &quot;haha NO WAY. And then what happened?&quot;<br>The_Last_Necro says in a duck voice(lips moving) &quot;Quack...&quot;<br><br>A Bitterly Cold World: It's the End of the World as We Know It and I Feel Fine<br>Slowly but surely though the bitter wastelands of Velious fell to those with immense power to make it happen. Across the lands phrases could be heard muttered on frozen tongues, such as &quot;what next?&quot; and &quot;what now?&quot; and of course the classic &quot;Daoc?&quot;. Dissent ran wild and unhindered, balance was no longer contemplated as people accepted their fate in this new cold and harsh world.<br>The Kunark encounters and many of the Velious encounters and ALL of the old world encounters became trivial as risk vs reward dictated obscenely powerful items dropped off the very difficult Velious mobs.<br><br>Then finally the Ice Age came to a slowly rolling close. No longer was there peace or friendship. Anger, war and strife ran rampant across the nearly post apocalyptic landscapes, where the cougars barely dared run any longer. The very air seemed to whisper the end of time. The magic was gone, the people were leaving for places with brighter futures. The classes remained completely irrevocably unbalanced. Was there any salvation for what had started as such a worthy Dream?<br><br>--Somewhere here the legendary Lum the Mad sold out to the french and his site became no more--<br><br>The End: I See a Horse Model and On It Is a Savior... No Wait That's the Grim Reaper...<br>To be continued...<br><br>I really can't imagine anybody reading this entire thing. It was NOT supposed to be this long but kind of grew into a jokingly bitter diatribe I suppose, plus it only took me 15 minutes to write or so. Either way the point of it was supposed to be the fact that the very fundamental design of EQ is flawed. The very essence of class balance in EQ is flawed because the classes were not designed to be doing what they are now doing.<br>The original concept has long since died, what is left is a war torn wasteland that does not bear well the scars of time.<br>-------------<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Like Gylgesh said, EQ is flawed. The initial design was really meant to be the 6 man group. Maybe 2 groups, but ultimately the game changed a great deal from its original intent because it was far more popular than they planned for. In my opinion it is unlikely that we'll ever see true balance in EQ, hopefully the changes will make the problems lessen, but they will likely never go away. As for DAoC, it seems to be balanced now for the most part. So was EQ on release, other than a few changes here and there (especially to rogues) no major changes were made or needed to classes until &quot;raids&quot; were common and were the primary focus of the players' time. From what I've gathered from others, having not played it myself, DAoC's high end game (PvP raids) hasn't been well tested, if at all. In several months people may see that when its all said and done, if you want to take down another large group, there are certain classes that are gonna be the best at it and others that don't have much use.
