I don't know if he composed it or someone else did.....food for thought......<br>
<br>
Open Letter to Terrorists :<br>
<br>
Well, you hit the World Trade Center, but you missed America.  You hit the<br>
Pentagon, but you missed America.  You used helpless American bodies, to<br>
take out other American bodies, but like a poor marksman, you STILL missed<br>
America.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because of something you guys will never understand.  America isn't<br>
about a building or two, not about financial centers, not about military<br>
centers, America isn't about a place, America isn't even about a bunch of<br>
bodies.<br>
<br>
America is about an IDEA.  An idea, that you can go someplace where you can<br>
earn as much as you can figure out how to; live, for the most part, like you<br>
envisioned living; and pursue Happiness.  (No guarantees that you'll reach<br>
it, but you can sure try!)<br>
<br>
Go ahead and whine your terrorist whine, and chant your terrorist litany:<br>
<br>
&quot;If you can not see my point, then feel my pain.&quot; This concept is alien to<br>
Americans.  We live in a country where we don't have to see your point.  But<br>
you're free to have one.  We don't have to listen to your speech.  But<br>
you're free to say one.  Don't know where you got the strange idea that<br>
everyone has to agree with you.  We don't agree with each other in this<br>
country, almost as a matter of pride.<br>
<br>
We're a collection of guys that don't agree, called States.<br>
We united our individual states to protect ourselves from tyranny in the<br>
world.  Another idea, we made up on the spot.  You CAN make it up as you go,<br>
when it's your country.<br>
If you're free enough.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we're fat, sloppy, easy-going goofs most of the time.  That's an<br>
unfortunate image to project to the world, but it comes of feeling free and<br>
easy about the world you live in.<br>
It's unfortunate too, because people start to forget that when you attack<br>
Americans, they tend to fight like a cornered badger.<br>
<br>
The first we knew of the War of 1812, was when England burned Washington<br>
D.C.  to the ground.  Didn't turn out like England thought it was going to,<br>
and it's not going to turn out like you think, either.  Sorry, but you're<br>
not the first bully on our shores, just the most recent.<br>
<br>
No Marquis of Queensbury rules for Americans, either.  We were the FIRST and<br>
so far, only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in anger.<br>
<br>
Horrific idea, nowadays?  News for you bucko, it was back then too, but we<br>
used it anyway.<br>
<br>
Only had two of them in the whole world and we used 'em both.  Grandpa Jones<br>
worked on the Manhattan Project.  Told me once, that right up until they<br>
threw the switch, the physicists were still arguing over whether the Uranium<br>
alone would fission, or whether it would start a fissioning chain reaction<br>
that would eat everything.  But they threw the switch anyway, because we had<br>
a War to win.  Does that tell you something about American Resolve?<br>
<br>
So who just declared War on us?  It would be nice to point to some real<br>
estate, like the good old days.  Unfortunately, we're probably at war with<br>
random camps, in far-flung places.  Who think they're safe.  Just like the<br>
Barbary Pirates did, IIRC.  Better start sleeping with one eye open.<br>
<br>
There's a spirit that tends to take over people who come to this country,<br>
looking for opportunity, looking for liberty, looking for freedom.  Even if<br>
they misuse it.  The Marielistas that Castro emptied out of his prisons,<br>
were overjoyed to find out how much freedom there was.<br>
<br>
First thing they did when they hit our shores, was run out and buy guns.<br>
<br>
The ones that didn't end up dead, ended up in prisons.  It was a big PITA<br>
then (especially in south Florida), but you're only the newest PITA, not the<br>
first.<br>
<br>
You guys seem to be incapable of understanding that we don't live in<br>
America, America lives in US!  American Spirit is what it's called.  And<br>
killing a few thousand of us, or a few million of us, won't change it.<br>
<br>
Most of the time, it's a pretty happy-go-lucky kind of Spirit.  Until we're<br>
crossed in a cowardly manner, then it becomes an entirely different kind of<br>
Spirit.<br>
<br>
Wait until you see what we do with that Spirit, this time.<br>
<br>
Sleep tight, if you can.  We're coming.<br>

<br>
That's one of the most disgusting statements I've read yet in any commentary on this topic.<br>
<br>
The people irrationally calling for &quot;nuking everything&quot; are scared, angry citizens of a nation that just lost 5000+ civilians (guess that doesn't *really* bother you since you can't seem to understand the anger as well as you understand the anger of the terrorists).<br>
<br>
The *leaders* of this nation have done nothing but begin planning an extremely measured and careful response.<br>
<br>
&quot;Many an American&quot;... what a joke...  I see that you are just as willing to generalize as the neanderthal racists that are out there destroying mosques; welcome to the club of narrowminded fools.<br>
<br>
&quot;Many an American&quot;, as in the 90% reported in the Gallop polls, feels that only a careful and measured response is appropriate.  No one wants to genocide innocent people or start World War III except for the extreme minority of lunatics in this country who are spiritually identical to the terrorists.<br>
<br>
Your responses are just as knee-jerk emotional and irrational as the angry posts that are supposedly causing you so much stress... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/01 10:32:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Bene,<br>

Sorry about that... I misread your post (I think) and overreacted on you... My apologies...<br>

I think you are right, actually.  The racist bastards crawling out of the wood work now can very well cause a real rift in the US and that was certainly the goal of the terrorists... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=167.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=176.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=175.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=175.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=175.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=175.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
