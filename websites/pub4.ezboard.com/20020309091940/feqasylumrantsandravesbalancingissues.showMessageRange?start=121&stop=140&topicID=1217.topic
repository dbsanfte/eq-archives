<br>
( I am Mrs. Kiixqar for anyone who didn't already know )<br>
<br>
In case you didn't understand, Sijandi, I left the guild not because my husband left the guild. I left because of the extremist, heavy-handed ways in which you administrate the guild forums,which I'm sure is a reflection on the way you make other decisions as a guild officer. (I suppose I shouldn't just include you in that, there was one other who took credit for deleting posts as well) It's true, it took a couple weeks for things to sink in, I gave it a great deal of thought, and had no intention of leaving the guild until the day I decided to leave. And that day I thought to myself "ya know what? that was really uncalled for". <br>
<br>
I will not even go into how silly I think the events leading up to my husband leaving the guild are. He has expressed that quite well, and I agree with him on that. <br>
<br>
I'm sure there are those who will disagree, but I will say this anyway.  I think that your response to my posting on the members forum the day after I left the guild is an excuse to bash me for something. You cannot criticize my behavior or attitude while I was a member, my actions always reflected the way our leadership wished the guild to be represented. I was well liked, and sought out by other members of the guild to group with. ( still am, btw ). I earned the right to respond to a topic that was about me, started by one of our friends. And I thought it was appropriate to NOT bring my comments to a public forum for the world to see, to keep this within the guild membership. So much for that, too much has happened to escalate this since then. <br>
<br>
There, that's MY 2 cp. <br>

I'm just sorry that opinion is not based on complete information. As for bashing you, perhaps you might inquire of some of my fellow guildmembers as to past situations sharing some aspects of this one. What was uncalled for in this situation was your husband continuing to post in a manner offensive to other guildmembers after having been warned by officers, not once but twice. He threw a temper tantrum when our guild leader tried to discuss the situation with him. After unsuccessfully trying to stir up shit in the guild, he ran to the Lanys board and tried to elicit sympathy for how &quot;wronged&quot; he was by the guild. A typical immature action from an obviously insecure person desiring attention. A private guild matter was brought to the community board when it had no place here. The matter was resolved within the guild. Your husband quit. You quit after repeated assurances the situation would determine your actions. You were lying either to yourself or the guild. <br>
<br>
As for earning the right to respond to a topic concerning you, you gave up that right when you left the guild. Regardless what your post was about, once you left the guild and especially under the circumstances at that time, you gave up the right to enter, much less post in, the MEMBERS ONLY Forum of our guild board.<br>
<br>
Anyone with a shred of decency and honor would not troll a guild board when they have quit the guild. There are public areas on the board for visitors to post. Members who leave under amenable circumstances have never been restricted from visiting or posting on our board. NOTE: OUR BOARD.<br>
Not your board. <br>
Not Kiix's board.<br>
<br>
As for my actions as an officer, your prejudice is most apparent here. You barely knew me during the SHORT period of time you and your husband were guildmembers. I have barely been active as an officer for quite some time. I offered my resignation at the time I knew I would be offline for an intedeterminate length of time and it was refused. I administer and moderate the guild board along with my son. I will NEVER allow hateful posts on our board. I will NEVER allow one member to attack another member in any manner on our board. Reasoned, literate discussion is encouraged. <br>
Asinine attempts at ill-disguised personal attacks thinly veiled as &quot;humorous&quot; posts is not tolerated.<br>
<br>
While some people may find your husbands humor funny, I personally do not. That was not the reason his posts were deleted. His posts were deleted because of statements which other guildmembers, longterm guildmembers in good standing, found offensive. He had the choice of either posting on another board somewhere else, or conforming to the standards of conduct expected of our guildmembers.<br>
<br>
Guildmembers are free to group with whoever they choose. Participating in any activity unacceptable to the guild will result in removal as surely as if the actions were your own. Internally, we always try to resolve issues. When you leave, you forfeit the right to be a part of any guild activity, ingame or offline.<br>
<br>
You and your husband obviously have issues. Regardless whether he asked you to leave or not, it is apparent from his posts here and your comments here and elsewhere that friction resulted from you staying in the guild after he quit. After he threw a temper tantrum during a discussion with our guild leader. After being told for the third time that posts attacking the beliefs of other members would not be tolerated. The guild would rather have just let the matter die, but Kiix' was not satisfied until he could elicit some response from myself, or other officers (I assume he wanted some response from other officers, I would never presume to be so desired myself). Instead of acting in a mature manner, he began this thread and posted veiled references to the matter in other threads which I posted in. Threads which are ongoing and include many intelligent, salient comments from a wide range of people. I'm sorry that group doesn't include your husband. I have seen nothing in any of his posts to change my opinion that he is nothing more than an attention - whore, buffoon who needs to be in the limelight to feel good about himself.<br>
<br>
I have been a guild member for some time. I was guild leader at one time. I've seen hard times in the Fold, and we have endured. We will endure this current situation and still be the guild known for our honor and willingness to help deserving players. We are a family and we care about each other. If that means sometimes not expressing our opinion about matters of importance to fellow guildmembers, that is part of caring. I'm not Chrisitian, but I would never dream of making any kind of post which was derisive to those who profess the Christian faith. It is a subject of enormous importance and deeply held convictions to those members. Just as the beliefs of our Wiccan and Druidic members are of great importance to them. <br>
<br>
Lack of consideration for your guild members is what caused the situation to develop, Kiix'. Whether you choose to accept that FACT or not is your decision. You can hold any opinion you choose about our guild and the officers and members, but your opinion does not change the facts. <br>
<br>
You made your bed, now sleep in it. <br>
As I said once before, GROW UP AND GET OVER IT.<br>
<br>
Nothing you do or say will change how the membership of our guild feels about each other. Johnny come latelys and short term members are but the blink of an eye, a flash in the pan. <br>
<br>
You wanted a public response. You got it. You got it in your thread, so I guess that makes you feel important. Sorry, in a week or two, this thread will probably be forgotten. The only interest most people have shown is in your &quot;humorous&quot; postings. I have seen nothing of substance in any of your posts. Blithe, off-handed, one-line comments in threads with relevant, informative posts merely show your shallowness. I feel sorry for someone such as yourself who can only get attention in the manner of a 2-3 yr old. Negative attention is better than being ignored, I guess this is your motivation.<br>
<br>
Before you tried coming to the Lanys board and stirring up even more shit about a minor incident in the life of our _social_ guild, you should have just left and gone about your business. It would have presented you in a much better light than your current course of action.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you're amused with my posts. It always makes me feel better to bring a smile to someone's face, even if it is a contentious, self-centered moron such as you. Everyone needs to smile and have a laugh everyday. Keeps us from taking life too seriously and helps us enjoy our time in this world more. So just keep reading, because I will continue to be a part of this community. A person with an opinion and the ability to express that opinion is a manner acceptable to the community. You were obviously unable to do so while a member of our guild. So far as I'm concerned, our guild is better off without you. I was sorry to see your wife go, because she seemed to me a very positive upbeat type person who always had something of _substance_ to add to any discussion. She was well liked by many of the newer members and several of the more senior members. <br>
<br>
As for escalating, you have your husband to thank for that. I and other guild members refrained from responding on the Lanys board, as this subject has no place here. A person can only tolerate so many snide, veiled remarks before losing resolve to rise above the level of some people. SO, for what it's worth, I'm down here in the muck and mud now, and ready to air our dirty linen in public for all to see. The truth is the truth, no matter how much you or your husband try to twist or distort events ot present yourself in a better light.<br>
<br>
My best advice to you both is to let it go, find something else to do and quit trying to slander a guild which has a good history and many dedicated members. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarianne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carianne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/29/01 4:00:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1217.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am Evil, hear me roar.</span><hr size=1> This has escalated almost beyond belief. I would like to address some of the issues as have been presented in this thread. First, Ratutu, as an Officer in the Fold, I always held you in high esteem, and felt you were an asset to our guild, and during your time with us, I still believe that you were just that! On a personal level, I liked you tremendously. When you decided to leave us, although I regretted your decision, felt I could understand your need to stand by your RL husband.<br>
 Kiixqar, I also liked, and indeed, kept in touch with you after you had left the Fold, for some time.<br>
 So, having said that, what next. Kiix, I believe you were spoken with and asked to maybe think a little before posting as to whether your post would be offensive. I would have thought that was reasonable, for while I will argue for your right to freedom of speech, I will also argue for the rights of others not have anything offensive placed where they are bound to see it. It works both ways. Maybe I am wrong in this, but I always felt, that unless you know a person very intimately, Religion and Politics are subjects best left alone, it is so easy to offend with those subjects, and what may appear to be amusing to some, is not so to others. A little consideration was all that was asked of you.<br>
 Ratutu, when you left us, I had thought, as I believe we all did, that if your principles in leaving applied to one of your characters, then surely it applied to all? So you posted in the members forum, the opening sentence in your post was such that I had no doubt that both had been removed, and when the post received the response that you no doubt expected, you sent an email to say you felt this was unfair as Opheliah was still in guild. <br>
 I have kept my own counsel on all the events that transpired until today, I discussed it with you shortly after you left us, as you know, and I have read this thread with interest, but have not found it necessary to speak of it, or respond until I read the most recent posts from you both. This is merely a 'storm in a teacup', and should be treated as such.<br>

Tedil told me it upset a lot of people.  I posted an appology before any one spoke to me.  The post was in fun, but is was not taken that way.  Tedil told me the post was funny, and that he wanted a pair of the sunglasses.  I asked him to delete my apology after I spoke with him because I thought it might stir people up even more.<br>
<br>
The next time I was spoken to, was about the Aliens and Pyramids post.  I can't believe any one thinks that was an attack on any one.<br>
<br>
As for the Merry samhain thing, nothing was said or done about that till after I left.  I have not attacked any ones religion, or any person for their religious beliefs.  The reason this all happened is because I called Sraha down for his insensitve remark about september eleventh.<br>
<br>
I make no claim that I was a valuable member of your guild.  However Ratutu was, and she drew many people to the guild.<br>
She would have stayed in the guild except it became more and more clear to her that some were more equal than others in the guild.  I find it sad that Sijandi has no respect for the new members.<br>
<br>
Yes, this a storm in a tea-cup, but what in life isn't?  In the passed year, Ratutu has known more sorrow than I can bear. Her time in the guild seemed to ease this where nothing else could. My posting also cheered her up, my commedy is borne of necessity and I speak to please no one but her.  It became apparent that some folks were trying to drive a wedge between us, and that invoked my ire.  Ratutu began to see that the guild was not what it appeared to be and left.<br>
<br>
That is all I will say about our real life.  <br>
<br>
For fear of making a long unreadable Sijandiesque like post I will leave it at that, except to say I have asked no one to choose sides, or leave your guild.  Some would have stayed if they had been given an explanation, but i suppose that was too much to ask.<br>

<br>
<br>
&quot;Guilds, good god, what are they good for? Absolutely nothing!&quot;<br>
<br>
(Opinion stated as fact. Guilds are good for many things. Deliberately stating falsehood is known as bald-faced lying.)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Unless of course you missed the opportunity to be a high school student council member, then guilds give you the chance to wear the title of sgt. of arms with all the pride of a McDonalds assistant mgr.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Guilds provide much more than this pathetic statement.)<br>
<br>
 <br>
&quot;You have no need for intelligence or wit, you can simply censor any one who is smarter than you,<br>
(in your case, that would almost everyone around you, in my case the percentage is much less) <br>
and then make hollow threats of your verbal prowess after banning the offending individual from posting on your site,<br>
(no threats were made against you)<br>
 the site you rule with an iron fist. The site wich is your beloved kingdom. You can feel good about yourself for ridding evil from your society, or at least people who don't think the same way as you do.(seems you are the one with no tolerance or sensitivity for anyone who doesn't agree with what you write) Every one knows in this new age of multi-culturalism differing attitudes and views are to be rooted out and destroyed. So if you are a paranoid, hyper-sensitive, elitist, socialy impaired waste of protoplasm, Guild Board administrator is the job for You!&quot;<br>
( I think there are a few Guild Board administrators that would question the veracity of these statements.)<br>
<br>
<br>
They fear the power of immense vocabulary.<br>
(ROFLMAO) <br>
They fear my socks, for they are malodorous. They fear the inner machinations of mind for they are convoluted. <br>
They fear the stinging truth in the conviction of my words.<br>
(ROFLMAO)<br>
<br>
I am quite bellicose.If they can't delete me, they ignore me.<br>
(Most people ignore things that are of no consequence to them.)<br>
<br>
I expected more as well. I, Kiixqar,etc. etc., am EEEEvil.<br>
(LOL) <br>
<br>
I was threatened about posting there again.<br>
(Again, you were not threatened, you were warned about making posts in the guild forums which offended other guild members, posts which became more offensive after you had been warned. After you quit you were warned if you did not stay off the guild board the password would be changed. An event which occurred after your wife posted to the Members Only Forum after having quit the guild.)<br>
<br>
The reason quit the guild was because of a post I made being deleted.<br>
(The reason and time you quit the guild were during a discussion in which the guildleader tried to help you understand why and how your posts were offensive to other members. You threw a temper tantrum, became verbally abusive to the guildleader and quit in a huff. This was the same time your third post was deleted.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 It was considered to be an attack on religion. <br>
(No, it offended some of the guildmembers, that is the only reason your posts were deleted. Not because of intent, because of content.) <br>
<br>
This attack did not come until my ability to answer it was gone.<br>
( No attack, but the matter was discussed with you twice, and the third time was the occasion of your departure from our guild.) <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To those of you who still insist that my post about pyramids and aliens was an attack on religion, I am sorry that I offended you.( I sincerely doubt you are the least bit sorry for any of your actions, or your posts, here or previously on the guild board.)<br>
<br>
All of my posts on your guild boards contain cryptic messages designed to make fun of you and everything you believe in. You are just not smart enough to figure them out. I suggest you delete them now before any one else reads them.<br>
( You have no idea of any of our intellectual abilities or capabilities. This again is merely your opinion stated as fact.)<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not consider any attack on freedom a small thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Now for an unveiled attack on you. If you really think the cradle theory is so lovely, why don't you do the dolphins and roaches a favor and get off the planet.<br>
(Gee, this sounds like an attack on others right to live on this planet, even if they disagree with you. See &quot;I do not consider any attack on freedom a small thing.&quot; Once again you contradict yourself. Hell, this isn't even an unveiled attack. Merely more of your whining.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes I did put up a post about peace-nick ban sunglasses, sunglasses touted to remove peace-nicks from your view. The post was deleted, do to it's quote strong political content.<br>
(Once again, the post was deleted because other members were offended by it. Regardless of content or intent, it offended other members and was deleted.)<br>
<br>
 I did not raise a fuss.<br>
(????? You haven't shut up about your precious posts being deleted since the first one was removed.)<br>
<br>
I posted an apology, and after consideration asked that it be removed, I thought some might take it the wrong way and get even more offended.<br>
( I _seriously_ doubt that was your motivation. I think it was probably more along the lines of &quot;Well, if they were offended by that, fuck 'em, watch what I post next. An apology would have looked insincere considering your actions immediately following this point in time.)<br>
<br>
Yes I did post Merry Samhainous... I have an Idea lets build a wicker man. <br>
This post stayed up for a long time, <br>
(A long time????? Yeah, tell another. That post was deleted within 1-3 days of being put up. There are days that neither my son or I read the boards.)<br>
<br>
I heard no mention of it until after I quit the guild,It was also not deleted until after I quit the guild.<br>
(A blatant falsehood. You were informed of it ASAP after the deletion. You were still in the guild at this point.)<br>
<br>
 I guess some took this as an attack on their religion. It was not intended to be taken that way, but some people are just touchy I guess.<br>
(Again, it was not considered an attack, it was considered offensive and deleted. It was too inane to be considered a serious attack on the offended members religious or spiritual beliefs. Ask Xian Le about stupid jokes that are still considered offensive, or name calling that has no place on a board. If you posted racist jokes, they would not be considered a serious attack on civil rights, but would still be extremely offensive. You give yourself much too much credit for way too many things that are definitely beyond your intellectual capacity.)<br>
<br>
It is now being reported that I was reprimanded for the merry samhainous post. This is a case of revisionist history, but i don't suppose that matters.<br>
(Talk about revisionist history. If your story doesn't hold water, just distort things a bit. After all, the only other ones who know the exact sequence of events are the ones you are trolling and flaming, no one will be surprised when your statements are denied.)<br>
<br>
 The truth is I was reprimanded because some one in the guild thought my aliens and pyramids post called all of their holy places and temples alien trash. This just makes me chuckle.<br>
(Seems like this is only one of several reasons you now claim you were reprimanded. Your post did exactly that, attributed many of mankinds' greatest works, called wonders of the world, to discarded alien lawn ornaments. Trash. Regardless, the reason you were reprimanded is that despite having been advised to try to be more considerate in your posts, you evidently set out determined to do exactly the opposite. You posts left little doubt as to the intent, after all...if someone tells you please don't do that, and you say ok, then turn around and do it again....what doubt can there be you intended the posts to be offensive, even after having been warned? Not much doubt in my mind, or the other officers involved. Hence, the deletions and the discussion.)<br>
<br>
To those of you who can't see the forest for the trees, I say this, train me with your alts.<br>
( If anyone in the Fold trained you, with any char, and you can provide any substantial evidence - those players will no longer be Fold members. We do take honor seriously, unlike attention-whores who bring guild business to the community board in a pathetic attempt to elicit sympathy and support for a moot point. You left the guild, let it go.)<br>
<br>
if you must, berate me in your private boards and characterize me as you will, but do not attempt to talk to me in game. <br>
(No one berated you on the private boards, we basically went on with our lives and business until your blatant trolling and flaming irritated me enough to take the time to respond at length. Which as everyone knows, I am quite practiced at.)<br>
<br>
Honor is nothing if not defended, and hiding under rocks is not defending honor.<br>
(Honor is as honor does, but you would know little about that. No one was hiding under any rocks, just basically trying to ignore an annoying idiot.)<br>
<br>
I have given up on the deleters of my words answering me here. <br>
(Merely the first time you state you have let the matter go, which you evidently did not do.)<br>
<br>
They post else where but will not face me head on.<br>
(By they, you must mean me....that has been evident from the start. I post in threads which have topics in which I have an interest. I continue posting in threads which have substantive content in the discussion. I dislike rehashing this matter, but I will not stand by and continue to watch you slander our guild and post your lies and distortions.)<br>
<br>
These folks claim to be open minded, I submit that they are not.<br>
(You decide who is open-minded and who is not? Good to know that.)<br>
<br>
I earned their dislike by speaking my mind. Strange, as it may seem, I Kiixqar, seem to have ideas to traditional and mundane for acceptance. <br>
(You earned my dislike by continuing to stir up shit. You earned deletions of your posts and a discussion from the guildleader for your offensive posts, and your apparent inability to take your fellow guildmembers into consideration. You obviously thought more of you asinine wit than guildmembers feelings.)<br>
<br>
It angers me that the book burning, and, segregation continue into to something as meaningless as a game. I have been sentenced to UNPERSON status. <br>
( No one can make you an unperson except yourself. You were merely removed from our board users, because of the apparent inability of you and your wife to refrain from entering a private forum where you had no right to be, much less post.)<br>

12/14/01 5:04:06 pm Well, I am back. Have you explained why Ratutu and I are gone? Is any one posting on your boards? Are people talking in guild chat? <br>
You say all of your guild officers carry the same weight as you, but you evidently don't trust them enough to tell them what happened. Why not tell them how evil I am? <br>

You have called me a liar other places, call me one here. <br>
(You got it bud, complete with documentation.)<br>
<br>
<br>
A man who can not stand to be disagreed with. <br>
If given the power he would delete any one who said something he didn't like.<br>
(I love to be disagreed with, but only by someone with intelligence and the ability to articulately discuss the matter under contention. Not idiots who consider their posts somehow more important than the feelings of their fellow guildmembers.)<br>
<br>
The next time I was spoken to, was about the Aliens and Pyramids post.<br>
As for the Merry samhain thing, nothing was said or done about that till after I left.<br>
(But previously above, you stated you were reprimanded because of the &quot;Aliens and Pyramids&quot; post. Which was it? The first time you were spoken to or the second? Get your lies straight.)<br>
<br>
The reason this all happened is because I called Sraha down for his insensitve remark about september eleventh.<br>
(Now this is really getting excessive. The fourth or fifth &quot;reason&quot; all this occurred. The fact of the matter is I knew nothing of your &quot;calling &quot;Sraha&quot; down for an &quot;insensitive remark about september eleventh&quot;. Hmmm, does this mean you attacked his freedom to make any comment he wanted to about a current event in American life? Surely not, you already stated you consider any attack on freedom no small thing. I _must_ be confused. {LOL})<br>
<br>
I find it sad that Sijandi has no respect for the new members.<br>
( I have all the respect for new members that they earn and deserve, which in your case was none. You were barely in the guild long enough to be considered more than a probationary member anyway. You have to stick around more than a few months or so to be considered a regular member. Hell, we've found out after more than 6-8 weeks that some inductees were not very honorable. Just glad we didn't actually have to catch you on to /guildremove you like we have several others.)<br>
<br>
It became apparent that some folks were trying to drive a wedge between us, and that invoked my ire. Ratutu began to see that the guild was not what it appeared to be and left.<br>
(Wedge? First mention I've heard so far of anyone trying to interfere in your relationship with your wife. This guild is exactly what it has appeared to be since it began. It is a guild of people who consider themselves friends and family through cyberspace. We are just as real online as offline, just as real ingame as &quot;real life&quot;. This all had to do with posts made to the guild board. If your wife decided to stay when you left, that's her business. If she decided to leave later, that's also her business. If guildmembers continue to group with and maintain friendship with either of you, that is their business. We do not limit our members playing experience in that manner. We demand honor in all that you do ingame. Maintaining a civil demeanor offline, on the boards, in chat, etc. is expected also, but the emphasis is on how you behave yourself in game and how you treat your fellow guildmembers and other civil players. That is why the matter was handled in the way it was, to avoid as much as possible extraneous material or situations which are offensive to the guild and its members. The fact of the matter is your freedom to post in public was not taken from you. You threw away your freedom to post in the private board of the guild when you continued to be offensive. You quit the guild for your own reasons. You refused to let this matter die for your own reason. I have refuted you for my own reasons, even though it was hardly worth my time to make this post. I hope to see this thread fade from view. Have a nice day.)<br>

Kiix, you know that I am the guild leader, I however do trust my officers.  That is why they are officers, you however appear to me to be someone who cannot let the problem go.  Lets see, you left the guild on November 13, 2001.  Posted your first post here on November 22, 2001, and you continue to bring up stuff that happened while you were in the guild and you can't even get the events straight within your own mind yet you expect people who are total outsiders to understand it.  Kiix you have been out of the guild for almost 2 months now, you are currently in another guild.  I ask that you stop this blatant attempt to slander a guild, it is only making you look bad at this point and will eventually reflect poorly on your new guild.<br>
<br>
Now, you may see that as a threat, I am not trying to threaten you, I am only trying to show you that dragging private bussiness through public forums only makes all parties (no matter who was wronged) look worse then they are.<br>
<br>
I have no intentions of posting here again, but if the situation arrises I may.<br>
