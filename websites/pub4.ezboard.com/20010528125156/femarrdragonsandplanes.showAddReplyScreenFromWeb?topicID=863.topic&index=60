<br>
Reading through here and who should I find Flaming you, but Cogito!  Oh yes, I know him.  See, I was a guide on Tribunal for a long time, that being Cogito's play server, as when I would keep track of the boards there I would invariably see Cogito spewing his vapid crap.  I resigned from the program about three months ago, but I still remember his name well and recognized it immediately, as a testament to how annoying the little pissant is.  Of course, at the time I couldn't respond to his posts, but now I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Part of what's below is directed at Cogito, but it's generally a few things I wanted to get off my chest.<br>
<br>
First of all, Cogito, unless you want to roll up your sleeves and put some effort towards helping others in a very tough volunteer position, STFU.  Really, that's about it.  If you want to be supportive, great.  If you want to be constructive, fantastic, guides appreciate constructive criticism.  If you want to come on and flame, and rant about corruption, and what a victim you are and how you have been mistreated, then please just spare all of us.  I wasn't the only guide on Trib who knew your name (and probably am still not), and while I know you would be helped within the terms of our guidelines, you certainly haven't made any friends among the guides there.  And since guiding is largely a set of judgement calls (however much the rules try and make everything black and white, and make judgement calls unnecessary), it's better to be on good terms with those making the decisions, than alienating yourself.  Now, I'm not saying suck up to the guides, kiss their ass and all.  No, I'm saying treat guides with a degree of respect, and you will find that respect is returned.<br>
<br>
You may not think that Guides will remember you, but largely it's the same 50 people petitioning 90% of the time, and we definitly do remember the regulars, and as Tweety said, the half dozen guides who actually regularly show up for work, DO TALK.  We know who the bad eggs are, you're not fooling us, and we're watching you.  Maybe not you Cogito, I don't recall you being a bad egg or a troublemaker, mostly just someone who reguarly goes to whine and start shit on the boards.  So since you've probably never received any sort of official response before, you can consider this one:<br>
<br>
Your guides know about you, your thoughts and your feelings about them, and for the most part they feel pretty much the same about you.  The thing is, they don't have to like you to do what they do, they'll still help you if you are in a situation that warrants it, but you haven't made any friends.<br>
<br>
On a final note, about judgement calls, I wanted to talk about special treatment.  Frankly, yes, there is some special treatment for some players, simply from the fact that a guide has to look at the evidence and decide if they believe someone or not, in some cases.  However much VI would like guiding to be black and white, right and wrong, it isn't.  Now I can't speak for everyone, and I know guides who stuck more firmly to the word of the rules, and I know guides who pretty much stuck by their own conscience, and both were good guides.  I was somewhere in the middle and stuck between the word and what I felt was the spirit of the rules.  Who got special treatment from me?  Not the uberguilds, not the players that paged me every time I was on to say Hi and ask how I was doing (and generally kiss my ass), not people who claimed to be guides or have friends who are guides.  The people that I would most often give the benefit of the doubt to, when the occasion permitted, were those who were polite, to the point, rational and reasonable, and sincere.  Those are people I identified with, the type of people I feel deserved the benefit of the doubt, the type that didn't alienate me or waste time that could have been used to help others, and essentailly exhibited the type of behavior that I believe deserves to be rewarded.<br>
<br>
So in parting, ranting at guides is not going to get you anywhere.  All guides have, at one time or another, been subject to some of the most vile personal attacks by some of the slimiest denizens of Norrath.  After that, a guide either realizes that they don't feel like the abuse and quit, or they harden themselves and any other attacks like that run off them like water off a duck's back.  Don't waste your breath, all you'll do is annoy the guide and if you annoy them enough they'll actually remember your name, which isn't a good thing.  So treat guides with respect, and they will do the same for you.  Guides WILL help you whenever they are able, they want to, and often when they know you deserve it but they also know that they still can't help, you miss out on the guide being angry and frustrated and ranting on your behalf on the guide channel.  <br>
<br>
95% of guides do NOT powertrip, you do NOT pay their salary (what salary?), and they do NOT need to be there.  When players come down on guides, the usual resut is a weakening of resolve in the more experienced guides, those that are starting to feel burnt out from the job.  When you drive off those guides that know their job well, are well beyond the novelty of the 'powers', and are motivated purely by the desire to help their fellow players, you hurt your own position as they are necessarily replaced by guides who are new and inexperienced, and often those that score lower on the entrance tests simply because the pool for guides is finite.  You get rid of the guides that get the 'A' on their test, and end up with guides who scored a 'C' or 'D', simply because there is a need for bodies.  The fault is only partly with the abusive players, but they are certainly a contributing factor.<br>
<br>
Okay, really stopping now, to leave off I'll quote Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure: Be Excellent to One Another! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My problem is with one of the guides on Povar ... what happened was I was sittin in this inn (trissa whistlesong spawn..) around level 15 when a Dark Elf came in and wouldnt stop KS'n, as a druid I could maybe manage 1/15 kills, I asked him to share and we could each take a kill and he told me to f*** off and started spamming me, i petitioned and said I'm being spammed and someone keeps KSing me and I can hardly get any kills. Well, half an hour of puttin up with this guys crap later a guide contacts me, he's pretty cool at first until he asks me to wait for a GM to come so that they can warn this guy who was swearing at the GM's. (he was claiming that he should be able to do this since i was a light race and he was a dark race, and that bla bla bla this is BS bla bla bla.. well if he was really role playing he shouldn't be in freeport unless he was on a raid hehe) well anyways after watching them argue for about 20 minutes with no GM showing up yet I said, you know what screw this I'll let you guys duke it out im gonna go somewhere else. WELL, then the guide said I got myself involved and If i left now he had the power to ban me. Being as gullible as I am and thinking him serious I stuck around for 2 goddamn hours watching all this bickering between the guide, the player and the gm (who showed up after like 30-40 minutes) THEN I said screw this I'm leaving, zoned outa freeport to then zone again and find I had been banished to mother friggin EverFrost Peaks for being abusive towards a Guide and GM! I asked them why I was banished and they said I was being abusive because I SWORE at them. I said Screw You guys i'm leaving and got banished to friggin EverFrost (and incase you didnt know, they bind you to your &quot;banishment&quot; spot too, so basically you have to run all the way back). Anyways on my way back I did happen to get killed by a giant that I didnt see in the karanas. But anyways, I messaged that asshole DE later that night and found out he got away scott free after SWEARING AND ARGUING WITH a GM AND GUIDE FOR 2 FRIGGIN HOURS! They simply asked him to try and reach compromises in this type of ordeal later on and left him there. Sorry bout saying that, just figured i'd post my little rant too heh... had to get that off my chest, this was with some alternate character druid I had made... (my original druid was like level 33, but I wanted to just play as a halfling to fool around and made another druid, dont know why I was compelled to do that)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also to Coggin : The best dennis miller rant ever was when he was talking about how 3M had to have a HUGE recall on about 100,000 locks that they made, because two weeks after shipping they learned that there was a way to open them that even children were learning... and then he was like ... this is a company that specializes in the making of FUCKING LOCKS!!! <br>

That's correct. The edit ability is disabled for this forum, since this is a flame &amp; rant forum. People often tend to flame when they're angry and remove it next day because they regret. I hope this makes people think twice before flaming other players.
