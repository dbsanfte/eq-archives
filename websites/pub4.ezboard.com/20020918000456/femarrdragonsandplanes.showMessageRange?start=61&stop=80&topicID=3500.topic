<br>
I am sorry chit, but you could just as easily subsitute Chiteng for carathos<br>
<br>
and to call acts in a video game evil seems to me a little extreme.  I have to agree with igota on how far to take something like this though.  And i would also have to agree with when i would step in to try and stop sploiting or abusivness.<br>
<br>
/shrug, call me sheep if that makes you feel better.  but you can only take things so far and still come across as reasonable and objective.  You have taken them to far to be considered so, and that is why you receive so many put downs on your sanity.  <br>
<br>
To automatically call someone sheep because they disagree with you and agree with your nemesis seems rather ignorant to me.  Anything i posted was something i came up with on my own, or was based on the evidence that i saw and the things others wrote.  I never once posted as a &quot;sheep&quot; and to call me one is rather in accurate.  The same goes for Igo, i know him irl and all his opinions were formulated on his own, he needs no help.<br>
<br>
I see where you are coming from chit, but you need to keep in mind this is a video game that no one is being forced to play.  When you take your crusade to the extreme the way you have, you lose all credibility and percieved obectivity in doing so (whether you are right or not).  Yes this is someone elses opinion of you and you state that does not matter.  But if you want to get across to someone else your point, then it needs to matter.  You cant not care what someone thinks, but then expect them to look seriously at what you are suggesting.<br>
<br>
This post was made in objectivity after reading your post explaining your actions.  I hope you will consider what i am trying to say, you may be more successful if you do.<br>

What exactly can I do Birren? You say I should re-prioritize.<br>
<br>
Lets assume your right: People here wont allow me the luxury of departure.<br>
<br>
I was silent for three months. People DID notice because I was reading the board.<br>
But then, the biggest jackass on the board had to try and score cheap points<br>
at my expense. So here I am.<br>
<br>
Plus lets be honest for once, the bottom feeders here LOVE a huge fight.<br>
The more people involved the better they like it. If its gets REALLY good<br>
they can drag in people who have not been seen on the board for two years.<br>
What does that say about the lowest common denominator?<br>

You are posting on a board which i am a member of. Therefore anything in it concerns me. These threads are NOT private. You choose to make your email private so that these matters cannot be taken up in private, therefore they are all public and concern all members of this community.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Your Rant was repetitious and trite.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
thank you for your literary criticism. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Better people have said more with less.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
good for them. You are however not one of them<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You are not a doctor nor am I your patient.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
this does not change the fact that you are in bad need of a Doctor to cure your delusions and lack of a grasp on reality. You are obviously unable to deal with the world in a sane manner. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I give none of what you say<br>
credence.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Of course not. You deny anyone but you and those who agree with you have any credence. This does not change the fact that your own posts rob you of any credence. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;My sanity(or lack) is MY affair and not yours.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
WRONG!!   You are imposing your insanity on all the members of this community. That makes it our affair. You are imposing your delusional &quot;crusade&quot;, your obsession with perceived slights in some game environment on all the members of this community. You declare openly that you dont care about anyone but yourself. YOU make your insanity and delusions the affair of all the members of this board.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I will do whatever I want, in the way I want.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You have made this abundantly clear. You have made your antisocial feelings known over and over. You have made it clear you dont care about anyone but yourself. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; It is a free society(you remember that right?)&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No it isnt. We all have responsibilities that go along with our rights. We all have limitations on our freedoms. All except you of course. You accept no responsibility to the community. Only to your own delusional god complex. People like you who have no idea of social contract or acceptable community are the reason that there needs to be laws. While most people understand that their own right to enjoyment ends where it infringes with another persons right to enjoyment, yours is dependent on infringing others rights. You only get pleasure by depriving others of their own enjoyment. You prove that over and over in your posts. <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

<br>
<br>
You are completely out of control.<br>
<br>
Lets take this slowly shall we?<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
The title of this post and the first post in it clearly are designed to put everyone in the frame of mind that dwark, carathos, kerryn etc etc are the purpose of this post.  To point out that they rabidly go after you.<br>
<br>
you then say later on<br>
<br>
Dwark is the reason for this post.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't know about you but this is a pretty clear contradiction.  Was dwark the reason for this post?  Was carathos and crew the reason for this post? OR perhaps the whole reason for this post was just to get some more attention?<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
You say over and over that you do not care what others think.  Yet, you are going to GREAT strides to vindicate yourself.  In order for someone to try so hard to make people see your &quot;vision&quot; and your &quot;truth&quot; you have to care what they think of you.<br>
<br>
Again, a clear contradiction.<br>
<br>
Do you care what people think?  or do you not?<br>
------------------------------------------<br>
You say your crusade is against abusive players and against exploiters yadda yadda.  You then say that you see that Mitch did nothing wrong and that the others are going after her/him/it just because it is Mitch.<br>
<br>
Now I dont know mitch at all (as hard as that is to believe) but simple math.<br>
<br>
Did Mitch Train?  yes-she admitted it.<br>
Is training abusive? yes-most of the freeworld of EQ believe this<br>
<br>
thus Mitch = Abusive.<br>
<br>
So.   By saying Mitch did nothing wrong.  Does this mean..<br>
<br>
a) your crusade is a facade to get more attention?<br>
b) you truly do not believe as whole heartedly in your crusade as you would like us to think?<br>
c) you are taking this stance, secretly not liking Mitch for this action but publically defending it to get more attention?<br>
c) there is such a thing as justifiable abuse?<br>
<br>
think carefully.<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The bottom line is,  you generate this all on your own.   If you would say your piece, accept that folks will not agree and will attack ya, and shut up. .  then I would say 75% of this would not be an issue.  Trying to keep your stories straight and consistant would be a help to... but that is just a hunch.<br>

There was never serious intent to persuade anyone of anything. As I have stated<br>
many time before, and it goes unrefuted, this board is polarized.<br>
<br>
In the LARGEST sence Dwarkarn is directly responsible for me being here now.<br>
<br>
I had been absent for three months and I was doing just fine not being here.<br>
However, that isnt the way he wanted it. He bears SOLE responsibility.<br>
And yes I love pointing that out to him every chance I get.<br>
<br>
Being wrong, isnt the same as lying.<br>
Even assuming I was wrong, which I wasnt, I didnt delibretly try to mislead anyone.<br>
In fact I went out of my way to clarify exactly what I did mean.<br>
These clowns enjoy using the word - liar.<br>
So I toss it back at them, until and unless they stop.<br>
<br>
The more erudite among you can see that there IS a difference between<br>
being wrong and lying.  Only a dishonest man would delibretly misrepresent<br>
things in an attempt to score points. I dont like such men. Thus we have this thread and that title.<br>
<br>
When and if you denounce Vendrix the same way you denounce Mitch,<br>
I will consider that a real issue. I am still waiting. I will be waiting a LONG time<br>
I fear.<br>

Are you sure you arent looking in a mirror when you post?  You seem to be the personification of everything you are accusing others of. You keep saying you dont care about anyone but yourself and yet you state here that you are unable to resist responding and answering &quot;the biggest jackass on the board. Ignoring the fact that this appelation could only accurately refer to you, if you dont care about anyone else, why cant you resist being baited by people you SAY you dont care about? Your actions belie your words. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Plus lets be honest for once, the bottom feeders here LOVE a huge fight.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
pot,  kettle   At least the so called bottom feeders usually admit their slimy motives. They dont wrap their pleasure in baiting you in paladin metaphors and delusions of conducting a holy crusade over something that happened years ago to their pixels. Unlike you, they admit they just have fun pissing on each other. You apparently just like being pissed on as much as they like pissing on you. They recognize real life from fantasy. <br>
<br>
case in point:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;What exactly can I do Birren? You say I should re-prioritize.<br>
<br>
Lets assume your right: People here wont allow me the luxury of departure.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
What a crock! You insist over and over that you dont care about anyone but yourself. Yet you assign blame for your not leaving and stopping your terrorizing of this community on the people you supposedly dont care about.  You talk about how this is a free society, yet you only express that supposed freedom in ways that feed your own delusions instead of in ways that would benefit this community. If you truly didnt care about anyone else, what they say wouldnt have the power to deny you the &quot;luxury of departure&quot;. It is your need for windmills to tilt at that keeps you from leaving. You need to turn simple everyday mundane threads into holy crusades, simple posters into fantastic enemies and years old perceived slights into great evils in order to feed your delusions. Very Quixotic.<br>

be flamed and big deal.<br>
<br>
Has anyone noticed the almost desperate way that these clowns will try to prove me wrong on even the stupidest points? And I DO mean DESPERATE.<br>
<br>
Now they have taken to distorting reality (lying) in an effort to keep on trying.<br>
Hey man there are ALOT of people on this board I dont like. But I dont make @#%$ up<br>
about them. Unless I KNOW a man is lying, I dont call him a liar. <br>
<br>
Is integrity dead on this board? Doesnt anyone care about even a SEMBLENCE of<br>
the truth?<br>
<br>
What exactly would these Bozo's have actually accomplished if they HAD been right? Why is it so important to them? I think its indicitive of serious separation<br>
from reality. <br>
<br>
I would have just said, 'I guess I was wrong' and gone right back to whatever<br>
I had been doing. They gave me an opportunity to do more than that.<br>
<br>
What is so sad is that the board tolerates this banality, just because they dislike<br>
me more. Hey its all good. You all keep trucking.<br>

Yes, Vendrix is abusive also he trained therefore he is.<br>

Anyone who trains is abusive.   <br>

Now,  how about you.  Is or is not Mitch abusive?  Or is there justifiable abusiveness?<br>

and Rant. So tell me Merentha, are you not emulating what you claim I do then?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You are posting on a board which i am a member of. Therefore anything in it concerns me. These threads are NOT private. You choose to make your email private so that these matters cannot be taken up in private, therefore they are all public and concern all members of this community.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
If that was true - Merentha, then it is valid for ME also. I share the same rights you do. Ours is a classless society, you do recall that, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;Your Rant was repetitious and trite.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
thank you for your literary criticism. <br>
**************************************************************<br>
That wasnt literary critisism, but if you want that:<br>
It was personal, non-topical, overstated, overblown, pendantic, possibly petulant.<br>
It was repetitious, trite, non-focused, marginal, abusive, incincere, overly dramatic,<br>
unresearched,un-sited, political, self-aggrandizing,<br>
nothing more or less than what I expect from a Rush clone.<br>
<br>
I am very dissapointed in you Merentha. I have seen you do much better, and with less words. You must learn to control your passions. They ARE your undoing.<br>
<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;Better people have said more with less.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
good for them. You are however not one of them<br>
*************************************************************<br>
When I try to be, and if I fail, that might actually mean something.<br>
<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;You are not a doctor nor am I your patient.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
this does not change the fact that you are in bad need of a Doctor to cure your delusions and lack of a grasp on reality. You are obviously unable to deal with the world in a sane manner. <br>
*************************************************************<br>
That implies my freind that you are in a position to be responsible and disspassionate. You are neither. You are no more than political - AT BEST.<br>
You do no more than dismay me, because I know you can do better.<br>
<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;I give none of what you say<br>
credence.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Of course not. You deny anyone but you and those who agree with you have any credence. This does not change the fact that your own posts rob you of any credence. <br>
*************************************************************<br>
Not so. There ARE people that I do listen to. Very few agree with me on any issue.<br>
No you are not one such. You could be, if you cleaned up your act a bit, but you choose the lazy route. That isnt impressive or endearing. If you want me to listen<br>
then you must drop the - pseudo-patronization(which is really quite hilarious)<br>
and speak to me as a peer. Only then will I listen. Drop the value judgements on the way in also.<br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;My sanity(or lack) is MY affair and not yours.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
WRONG!! You are imposing your insanity on all the members of this community. That makes it our affair. You are imposing your delusional &quot;crusade&quot;, your obsession with perceived slights in some game environment on all the members of this community. You declare openly that you dont care about anyone but yourself. YOU make your insanity and delusions the affair of all the members of this board.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
Not at all, really Merentha drama has its use, but it isnt helping you. You are amusing me, if that is your intent.<br>
Merentha it IS a free country. You CAN, NOT read my posts. I offer to you that<br>
proof which is obvious. If I am insane, then I surely must be entertaining in my madness. You inflict me, upon yourself, not me upon you. I am not standing next to you with a gun, telling you to read this or die. <br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;I will do whatever I want, in the way I want.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You have made this abundantly clear. You have made your antisocial feelings known over and over. You have made it clear you dont care about anyone but yourself. <br>
**************************************************************<br>
You are wrong. I would defend even Raedwulf, if he were attacked unjustly.<br>
Every player on the server is my concern. But again, 'I' make that evaluation,<br>
not YOU.<br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt; It is a free society(you remember that right?)&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No it isnt. We all have responsibilities that go along with our rights. We all have limitations on our freedoms. All except you of course. You accept no responsibility to the community. Only to your own delusional god complex. People like you who have no idea of social contract or acceptable community are the reason that there needs to be laws. While most people understand that their own right to enjoyment ends where it infringes with another persons right to enjoyment, yours is dependent on infringing others rights. You only get pleasure by depriving others of their own enjoyment. You prove that over and over in your posts. <br>
I think, therefore I am . . . What's your excuse?<br>
**************************************************************<br>
<br>
OH my, Jean Rousseau? Tomas Mann? DesCarte<br>
Such a powerfull invocation. Surely it will dispell<br>
the evil Chiteng!  <br>
<br>
And who is the arbiter of how one deals with those responsibilities? You? I dont think so. That is YOUR conceit.<br>
I am hardly god, I am more than mortal. I am reminded of it every day I wake up.<br>
I do nothing of the kind to you nor anyone else. As stated you inflict me upon yourself.<br>
I dont believe in Noblesse Oblige, no man is better than me and no man worse.<br>
I am TOTALLY democractic in the purest sence.<br>
I think that those creatures that DO think that society owes them position,<br>
should have all their possessions perfectly legally legislated away, let them then take their place among their peers. I laugh at such arrogance.<br>
<br>
BTW my freind, dont look too closely in the mirror. Your not well liked around here either. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

<br>
Thank you for finally admitting what we all knew all along. That you are only here for the enjoyment you get from irritating others. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;In the LARGEST sence Dwarkarn is directly responsible for me being here now.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
In only the broadest sense is that true. It is much like us blaming your parents for your being here to annoy us. If this society is as free as you claim it to be, Dwarkam cannot force you to be here. You CHOOSE to be here. No matter what Dwarkam says, you have to CHOOSE to respond. He cant issue a subpoena forcing you to appear in the court of this board to answer him. You choose willingly and gleefully to take every opportunity to come here and irritate people for your own pleasure.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I had been absent for three months and I was doing just fine not being here.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No you werent. You admitted above that you refrained from posting but continued to read. Absent means not present. If you were absent, you would not have  seen anything Dwark wrote and thus would have been immune to his attempts to rob you of &quot;the luxury of departing&quot;.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;He bears SOLE responsibility.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
like most criminals and anti social personalities, you blame your actions on others and dont take responsibility for your own actions. You are pathetic<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;However, that isnt the way he wanted it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
this is your own fabrication. Just because Dwark mentioned you in passing doesnt mean he wanted your evil countenance back in this community. Today I mentioned in passing my  mother in law's cancer which she overcame. Trust me, I do NOT wish it back in her life. This is not Harry Potter. People here should not have to call you &quot;He who is not named&quot; or risk your reappearing magically as if summoned. That is only in your fantasy world in your head. Please go get help so you can differentiate between the two.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Being wrong, isnt the same as lying.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
that is true. You are guily of both by your own definition<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Even assuming I was wrong, which I wasnt, I didnt delibretly try to mislead anyone.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
yes you did. You just call it &quot;debate tactics&quot; when you do it and lying when others do it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;In fact I went out of my way to clarify exactly what I did mean.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You mean your Clintonian attempts to redefine terms or give working definitions after the fact or change the rules when your own words paint you into a corner?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Only a dishonest man would delibretly misrepresent<br>
things in an attempt to score points&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
damned by your own words. You have admitted to doing just this. You called it &quot;debating tactics&quot;.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I dont like such men. Thus we have this thread and that title.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Exactly what I have been saying all along. You dont like yourself and your real life so you create a fantasy world here, full of mortal enemies for you to slay, great evils to avenge; In your fantasy world you are god and can create and change the rules as you wish.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;When and if you denounce Vendrix the same way you denounce Mitch,<br>
I will consider that a real issue. I am still waiting. I will be waiting a LONG time<br>
I fear.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
More of your attempt to set the agenda and make the rules and call black white and white black. He did not attack Mitch. That is your attempt to mischaracterize others words. He attacked your use of Mitch as an issue to further your goal of anti social behavior. Neither Mitch or Vendrix are the issue in your posts. The only issue is your sick need to irritate as many people as you can for your own pleasure. You admitted as much in your explanation of the header of this thread which I quote at the top of this post.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
  First,  I have condemned Vendrix with the same verve as Mitch.  You see,  I don't know either of them.  I have no idea really who they are.  I have not had the pleasure or displeasure of their company, nor have I been around when either did anything.  Thus the condemnation you speak is as much as it will go.<br>
<br>
People who train are abusive.  Pretty simple there capn.<br>
<br>
vendrix trained, therefore he is abusive<br>
mitch trained, therefore he/she is abusive.<br>
<br>
Anything beyond that would make me a liar because you see I don't have the same sense of persecution (sp?) that you seem to have.  These people mean nothing to me.   They could be named dick and jane for all I care.  It is the subject that is important.<br>
<br>
And yes, I know the whole thread about you condemning Vendrix and them condemning Mitch.  To you guys there is a distinct, clear, emotional basis for your pursuit.   What I am posing is a simple, very very simple question, which you cannot seem to answer.<br>
<br>
Is training bad?<br>
Did Mitch train?<br>
Is mitch bad?<br>
<br>
Now,  please have no misunderstandings.  I know why you cannot answer this.  You have allowed yourself to be put in the position of being contradictary and thus giving everyone more ammunition.<br>
<br>
If you say that Mitch was indeed abusive.  You will then be contradicting a VERY Long thread on that topic and have no way out.<br>
<br>
If you say that Mitch was justified, you will then be contradicting your stance on Vendrix and thus have no way out.<br>
<br>
You cannot answer it, because no matter what your answer you will be in contradiction of your stance.<br>
<br>
That is why you wont answer it, and you keep putting conditions on it.   You said condemn vendrix.  I did.  You then said, no no no condemn him the way I want you to.  Well, sorry .. . I have not, will not, have no reason to go after Mitch and thus will not go after Vendrix with any more &quot;Verve&quot;.<br>
<br>
I, however, do believe that i have more than made my stance obvious, because you see  I am firm in my beliefs.<br>
<br>
You sir,  cannot say the same.<br>
<br>
your choice is simple,  answer or dance.  I think we both know what you will do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, what about the rest?   There are still direct questions to be answered,  to which you have not.  Are you equally unsure about those as well?<br>

<br>
Let's get some things straight...<br>
<br>
 -You are not right, not right for trying to make good people who clown around on a virtual world seem bad, not right for ranting them out, spamming a message board with your senseless acts, until everyone believes that they are what you believe.<br>
<br>
 - You do not control everyone.  Everyone is a being of their own.  If they choose to like the people you hate, well... think back to your school lessons.  If we were all the same, if we were all like you, would the world truely be a better place?<br>
<br>
 - The people you hate do have friends of their own, and people do seem to like them.  Do people like you?  In this sense then they must be a good bunch of people, and you must be one little devil of a 36 year old man.  Maybe if you piped down some and took the time to meet the players in game, try grouping around with them, having fun with them, get to know who they really are, then you'd understand.<br>
<br>
 - You do not have a bigger penis than the people you hate.  Ranting at them until people like you and hate them more will not extend it's size... err... not saying I ever checked, but, you know...<br>
<br>
 - People are right asking you why you are on such a crusade.  If you had the gall to answer their question, or try to, you would find yourself in a studdering situation, or more likely, couldn't find an answer at all.  Why is this?  Because all you want to do is make out casts of Emarr's characters, and if Emarr wants to make them out casts then it is up to them, not you.<br>
<br>
So, the question is now, is Chiteng going to reply to me again or just going to dodge me and avoid admitting to what he's doing is just random acts of stupidity to try getting him some attention? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You assume that your point of view is valid. I accept that YOU feel that way.<br>
You need to accept that I feel the same way about MINE.<br>
Yours is NOT more valid, nor is mine less valid.<br>
<br>
Restate your questions, without the patronizing conceit and without the implicit<br>

It wont be the one you want, but I will indulge you.<br>
<br>
On a 'MORAL' level:<br>
<br>
I find that Mitch's training of (Darkwing?) whoever, equivalent to Vendrix training of Ewle. Not MORE, not less, only equal. I find that both parties were provoked<br>
to their actions, IN THE EXTREME. As such, it is considered as a mitigating circumstance, in BOTH instance. I found Chukzombi's testimony totally self-serving<br>
and it was discarded. I did go to AB and ask a few questions and as predicted<br>
all views were along guild lines.<br>
<br>
Mitigating Circumstance in this issue goes far and away to absolve both parties<br>
of implicit intent to do harm. The fact that Vendrix enjoyed doing it and indeed <br>
enjoined others to assist him in that enterprise, does him little credit.<br>
I do not find numbers of deaths alone a compelling circumstance. Only the decisions<br>
of the players at the time.<br>
