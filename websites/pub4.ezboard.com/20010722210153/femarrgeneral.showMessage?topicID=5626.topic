<br>
I have three memories that really stand out as being some of the funnest memories of my semi-long EQ career (2 years).<br>
<br>
As Krual:<br>
<br>
1. Way back in the summer of 99, 3 trolls, 2 dark elves and a human decide to run around Upper Guk and grab some experience and have a little fun (main gaol). Everyone was around or below level 20 (no one had any bronze even, this is a long, long time ago...when BTC was hot stuff) Anyways, the human we had was Arikel (bad monk, bad monk, wha'cha gonna do?) and he did our pulling, (we had 3 shadowknights- me, Kzan and Drazhkahn, one wizard - Cruelteez, and our healer was, get this, a shaman - Mornak, who did great) We all had great fun, no one died (much) and it was one of the best nights I've ever played because back then it wasn't about loot or experience, it was all about fun. Listening to blink 182 brings back these fond memories, it was blarring in the background, funny how I associate the two.<br>
<br>
2. Same 3 trolls decide to hop on the boat and go to Unrest (group teleports didn't exist back then, well, I should say the shout channel was never spammed with shouts for Tps) anyway, we run through the sewers of Freeport. Yeah, the sewers, the stuff underneathe the city, no one had invis. So we all wait at the bottom of the dock waiting for the boat to zone, 15 minutes later, boat zones and we all make a mad dash for the boat before the guard sees us. We're running, running, boat starts to move...JUMP! whew, we all make it on safely. Boat zones into OOT, my first ever experience in this zone, I was lvl 18 at the time...anyway, we didnt know that the boat would dock and guess who was waiting for 3 trolls at the docks of Sister Isle? You guessed it, a red conning and pissed off elf maiden. She jumps on the boat and starts to beat on Mornak, evil people scatter, some jump off the boat, some run into the hold while she mercilessly beats the tar out of Mornak. Boat starts to move and Mornak falls to the ground. Suddenly, she disappears, Mornak's still alive but unconsious, no walk from Neriak for him which would have sucked big time. The run through Butcherblock brought even more fun. Guard dodging and scare the newbie were wonderful games. First time I've experienced the meaning of the phrase: &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE!&quot;<br>

Was cool to go out and kill a skellie etc and get money that I immediately ran to spend on a new piece of leather (unless of course I was able to find a piece of patchwork on a vendor).. Finally I was comfortable enough with the game to explore a bit - found a goblin camp near Kaladim and got my butt kicked then freaked out trying to get my corpse back hehe - it took me 2 weeks just to make it all the way to the crossroads area in Butcherblock - I took screenshots all the way so if I got lost I could log off and look at the screenies in reverse order to find my way home... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usaavakspiritwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saavak Spiritwind</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.angelfire.com/tx4/saavak/images/Wolf.gif height=35 width=35 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 796<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 11:15:39 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/Mikev069/OGGY_SAAV1.JPG height=320 width=160></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What are your fondest EQ memories?</span><hr size=1> hmm, I would have to say my 1st exploration of Everfrost.  I happened to run into some huge castle entrance.  I was like cool, this could be fun.  Heart beating furiously...Next thing I know is I'm running from huge ass ice giant which I've never seen before.  I ended up aggroing 2 more that were in the towers.  This was while I'm a Lv 20's shaman.  I haul ass all the way back to the Halas ramp thinking that I'm safe.  I then see these 3 Ice Giants coming over the mountains.  My words then were, &quot;Oh Shit!&quot;  I didn't have a chance to yell train.  I zoned in to Halas fast.  I waited a little bit &amp; then came back out to see numerous n00bie corpses around &amp; the guards &amp; some of the other NPCs gone.

Running around WK with my newly dinged lvl 5 ranger. Up on a hill I see a large one eyed creature. Wow he looks neat so I wander closer for a better look. About that time I find our he has a brother who proceeds to mash me into ranger paste. I run back. Smoosh. I run back. Smoosh. Finally after about 2 hours I write off my valuable set of leather armor and rusty longsword.<br>

My second was my first trip from Qeynos to Freeport. I was awed when I saw the big chain bridge in NK. And I was terrified when we get to Highpass and the wizard who was our guide tells us if you get attacked just run. I get jumped by those nasty orcs(which back then weren't permacamped) and made it to the zone with 3 whole hit points. I stayed in Freeport forever because I was scared as heck to make that run back. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My first run in with an evil eye. Some guildies and I were running through EK when we ran smack into him. He then charmed me and I proceeded to help slay all my guildies. The charm wears off and I barely manage to slay him and his pet. Frustrating but probably one of the funnest moments I had in EQ.<br>

* I'm not certain, but I have a suspicion the l33t high-level bard who gave me 2 banded bracers, and a greater lightstone was Munkey. The bracers were my best armour for ages. I think I still have the lightstone in the bank. Perhaps my Crushbone tunic came from the same benefactor. I definately still have that one in the bank. Thankyou!<br>
<br>
* I fell off the boat travelling to FP and got killed by goblins. A dwarf paladin in full bronze armour swam half way around the zone and helped me recover my corpse. Thanks SO much Kalahari!<br>
<br>
* My ogre shaman teamed up with Dwenya a few times (and occasionally Sulea). She was in this thing I'd heard about called a guild. I was a bit wary of the idea of joining a guild, but I decided that they must be nice enough people if Dwenya enjoyed hanging out with them. So I met them and have been with Order of Reverence ever since. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=17133"><img border=0 src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/nettle/eq/maeri/maeri-7nov00.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umayaserena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mayaserena</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/13/01 5:45:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~rpippen/eq/maya_60x60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What are your fondest EQ memories?</span><hr size=1> My strongest memories (well the happy ones anyway) harken from my days of child-like<br>
innocence.  It's amazing how much has changed since then.<br>
<br>
1) Thinking that Steamfont, Butcherblock, Lesser Fay and Greater Fay were more room<br>
than I could ever fully explore and wondering why anyone ever left.<br>
<br>
2) My first run to Qeynos from Freeport.  Someone in WFP was shouting that he was going<br>
to lead a group there and I decided it might be fun.  I was level 14 and the farthest I'd ever<br>
been from FP was Oasis.  We ran for what seemed like forever.  I got seperated from the rest<br>
on top of a mountain in West Karana with all kinds of blue bandits wandering by glaring at me,<br>
and while trying to find me having one of the group die (he was bound in Freeport).  When<br>
it was all over I was so exausted from it that I laid down on the couch and slept for 4 hours.<br>
<br>
3) Joining the Sisters Without Mercy.  They were wonderful and I miss them terribly.  I was<br>
level 22 at the time and all the level 30's and 40's made me feel so young.  All the Sisters<br>
made me feel so welcome.  I miss the old-school Sisters like Desirae, Gilena, Scopullus, Fyste<br>
Milanya, and especially Ienia (who seems to be MIA now).<br>
<br>
4) FINALLY getting level 49 after going through sheer hell the previous 15 levels both because<br>
of hardships in the game, and personal issues with other players that just wouldn't go away.<br>
Doing that first res was also pretty sweet.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5) Joining United Norrath Coalition.  The first thing in over a year that made playing FUN again.<br>
God bless all you UNCers out there.  Bigtime hugs to Iliana who I met on her first day and have<br>
been good friends with ever since. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.mindspring.com/~rpippen/eq/maya_newsig.jpg" alt="Mayaserena Ce'Nedra" border="0"><br>

I guess I should add another favorite memory:<br>
<br>
* Ving finds out Laoke is a guy.<br>
