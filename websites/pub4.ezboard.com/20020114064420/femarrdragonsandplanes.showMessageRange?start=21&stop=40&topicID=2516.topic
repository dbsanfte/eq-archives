<br>
guildon is speaking from experience on the cheal thing.  when vox/nags were first being fought, ae group heals were commonly used, we upgraded to using cheals on main tanks who maintained agro.  we moved on from vox/nags before the cleric agro &quot;enhancement&quot;, so we didn't have that problem against them.  but then they tuned that down again, thank god for all of you.<br>
<br>
we learned to use complete heals to conserve mana...but again, we knew the people we were playing with very well and knew what they would do.  tanks trusted clerics to get their end done, and clerics trusted tanks to do their part.  it's a luxury pick up raids usually can't afford.<br>
<br>
believe me, we aren't belittling your reasoning, guildon was just functioning under old suppositions, i think he's been corrected.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yeah Im a fruitloop<br>
<br>
Anyway (my reason for posting again)... I've had several people send me tells in game apologizing for the events last night and I'd just like to say that no one owes me an apology, none whatsoever.  But those 2 clerics who were asked to join, who were told hours later that they would be disqualified from loot rolls may deserve it.  They stayed for the entire battle reguardless of the loot because they were good people... however they wont forget the actions taken either Im sure.  One of which is still in the process of trying to get his/her corpse because after the HOURS spent on the raid they had to leave.  <br>
<br>
My experience loss is no more of importance as anyone else who lost time and effort due to rotted corpses or un-resable corpses... that was a risk I was willing to take when signing up for this raid or any other that I have signed up for.  I have had corpses rot before, I'll have it happen again.  Its part of it.  I spent the last 8 hours trying to gain my lvl back and Im going to have to spend a few more doing so... but thats just part of "EQ life".  <br>
<br>
During the CR when there were less than 15 people remaining I went LD and was unable to relog.  It was 5am, 6am when I was able to log in.  I can understand why several people could not stay.  I felt awful that I was not there to port out, as I NEVER leave a raid until everyone is taken care of.  Never have, never will... no matter HOW bad the raid goes.  (I have left a raid BEFORE it started due to obvious lack of appropriate players, classes, lvls simply because there was NO possible way it would succeed... however if I am engaged in battle... win or lose you can be sure I'll be there til the end)<br>
<br>
When I signed up for this raid I was excited that it was yet another opportunity to kill that dragon as well as an opportunity to raid with Brecht since it was his last raid.  I had heard good things and bad about him but I didnt want to pass judgement on hearsay.  <br>
<br>
The raid techniques sucked I honestly dont believe he has led 40 Vox raids... and if so I'd like to know how many were successful??<br>
<br>
My dragon isnt dead yet.  But I am glad that I was part of a group of people who actually tried.  Im just sorry for those first time raiders that the event turned out so bad.  Dont assume they will all be like that.<br>
<br>
I was corrected about the person playing 4 characters, this person was defended, and I was told that no one was "bragging" about it, that it was just "made known" to the raiders involved.  I dont care how much this player has saved someones ass you cannot convince me that he/she could appropriatly control all 4 characters at time of battle.  Its impossible, and if it is possible... I'd like to see this octupus with fingers at work.  <br>
<br>
Oh and Im leading my FIRST Vox raid next week (may have to change the date now since she's still up) But I've learned a lot from the Vox raids I've been on... the good ones (thanks to the K-man) and the bad.  I can just say one thing when it comes to this upcoming raid or any others that follow... I'd call off a raid if I didnt have the appropriate players before I'd chance the loss of experience for so many people.  And Im sure they'd respect and it would look a lot better than the failures that have given so many people a bad rap.<br>
<br>
Anyway...<br>

If the fight goes as it should, the fight should be very short.  Casting Complete Heal takes too long for the length of an old world dragon fight.<br>
<br>
When fighting dragons, the spells I most rely on are Remedy for a quick small burst heal, Divine Light for a heavier burst of healing, and my AOE Heals to counter the Dragon's AOE blasts that were not resisted.  Aggro isn't the problem with Complete Heal, the problem is that the spell is so freaking slow.  Once you begin a CH with the intention of having it land, you cannot utilize the faster heals.  Those faster heals might not be efficient, but they keep people alive long enough to kill the dragon. <p><A Href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" Style="text-decoration: none">Quistil Angelwatch</a><br>

I heard about this raid from a guild paladin that was on the raid.  He'd told me there was one cleric and no enchanters.  I laughed and told him Sagemon's advice that he always gives me when I'm unsure of a raid .. if you don't believe in the raid leader, either leave or don't bitch when the shit hits the fan.  If you had a bad feeling, then you should have left the raid.  If you stayed, tough shit .. live with it.  <br>
<br>
As for pick up raids, there are some damn good pick up raid leaders around so don't condemn them all.  If you don't believe it, come watch Sagemon and myself run one some time .. we've had people who are even in the larger guilds tag along from time to time who mentioned they were impressed with the organization.  There are other raid leaders out there with the exact same thing going on.  Just because Brecht screwed this one up, don't condemn them all.<br>

Just the night before Kerna did vox with just one shaman, and she died. The key was that people listened and we had good leadership. And we did not rush the process. I was sorry to hear about the wipeout, and unfortunatly for me it kept me from being able to raid Naggy later that night. Oh well it is just a fantasy game and not real life. real lives are not at stake, so why don't we take ourselves a little less serious and concentrate on having fun.<br>

It's not like i got my corpse then left, i still do NOT have it.And no it's not 40 vox raids it 55+ Dragon raids that is Naggy/Vox....<br>

<br>
REASON FOR FAULT<br>
1.Vox chealed due to lack of stun<br>
2.Not enough high lvl clerics<br>
3.VOX agroed to buff hall!!<br>
4.Aggro in buff hall WHILE buffing<br>
5.Aggro BEFORE we charged naggy<br>
<br>
Well think what you want.It's only a game and i don't take it personal, i play for fun and we lost and i still had fun, i taught some how to raid we lost but i dont care about win/loss i play for fun! AND WHEN real life matters appear im gone,and i know i had backup people to lead the CR,so if you dont know the whole story go screw!!<br>

<br>
I am rather disturbed at the 4 person playing issue.  That said, I'd like to state some facts.<br>
<br>
In the battle, I was the monk who was first in the charge.  I was also the second of only two enchanters, and the higher level of the two.  I will leave it to your own judgment what that means or portends.<br>
<br>
In buffline, I was the late arrival.  I was the aforementioned monk and the enchanter who kept you in Clarity, Gift of Magic and Insight as you buffed Circle of Summer.  I was also the druid who brought me there, but I camped that character.<br>
<br>
I only played two characters in the battle.<br>
<br>
After the wipeout, I was the 53 cleric who rezzed you.  I was that same monk who dragged bodies.  I was the enchanter who gave Clarity to the rezzers.  I was the druid who ported the last group out.  And I stayed to the very end.  No, I'm not bragging, but I do feel some need to make my position known in the face of your accusations of my incompetence.<br>
<br>
Now, I understand that you are upset.  And believe me, I can understand this.  But please, I would really appreciate if you didn't deal too wide of a stroke in your anger.  We have had no cause for quarrel before, you and I.  I would not like to see it now.<br>
<br>
The raid failed.  That we know.  And we also know that it is known to happen.  I am not going to even try to address your grievances here, your feelings are yours and I would not short-change that.<br>
<br>
But please bear in mind, for however upset and justified you feel, there were those who went without grievance or expectation who not only fought beside you, but who helped clean up the mess in the end.<br>
<br>
I'm talking about the many members of my guild and their friends who kept their nose to the grindstone to do the task at hand, be it battle or CR, in spite of whatever you felt or saw.<br>
<br>
So I ask you, please be selective about your targets. <p>Théodwyn Riddermark, Disciple of Quellious<BR>

<br>
When Brecht logged, I said I would take care of it.  I am the leader of Vivix Protectorate, and I will not shirk responsibility when it falls upon me.<br>
<br>
For those of you who felt the CR was too long and who therefore stayed up far too late, were late for work, were grumpy to their children, or fell asleep in class, I am responsible.  Feel free to send me e-mail or tells and we can discuss it if you wish.<br>

I am truly lucky to be a part of Vivix Protectorate.  Although Ana would have kept her nose to that grindstone in any situation, it was a pleasure to do it alongside my family members.  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry for those that are angry.  However, I would like you to take into consideration that Brecht didn't exactly walk in saying &quot;Hi, I'm going to get you all killed today&quot;....It happened...all in all, we didn't lose nearly as much as we could have.  <br>
<br>
I think I walked away with much more than I went in with.  <br>

<br>
     My venting over the raid was extreme yes, and I apologize, I do appreciate the hard work that was put behind the raid, the CR, and everything else.  I have the utmost respect for those people who stayed and made sure everyone was taken care of.  However the reason for my "rant and flame" was not over the failure of the raid, it was the fact that the clerics who were lower lvls were told that they would be eliminated from the loot rolls.  Yes, as I said before, there were reasons given to me such as the higher characters have less time to raid Vox and the lower characters will have time later... however I still think due to the circumstances they either 1.  should have been included or 2.  told LONG before we were in chat that they would be eliminated.  THAT was my problem and THAT is what made me mad.  Also in another aspect, I feel that those higher players, who have less time for future Vox raids, also had more opportunities prior too... it would have been utterly unfair to eliminate the 2 players on their first raid.  The odds are against everyone, but to include two more people (regardless of their level) shouldnt have bothered anyone... it wouldnt have bothered me.  Especially since they were crucial parts of the raid period and called in from whatever it was they were doing to make the raid possible.<br>
<br>
     As far as the 4 accounts, 4 characters I had no clue who the characters were or who was behind it.  All I know is that I was told that "someone was playing 4 characters when we went to fight her" and honestly I dont see how someone can charge Vox with 4 characters at once.  So how it was done, was unknown to me... and I apologize.<br>
<br>
     Brecht I dont know you, I have not faught with you (that I can remember) and I apologize for being such a shit.<br>
<br>
     Yeah I guess you can say Im kissing ass, Im not, Im just realizing that my post was unjust, after finally getting a good nights sleep, I realize that I was out of line... so Im apologizing.<br>
<br>
     I plan to lead my first Vox raid on her next pop after she's killed tonight and I hope that it'll be a good experience for everyone.  If I fail it will teach me a valuable lesson as well as give me an opportunity to learn from my mistakes.  <br>
<br>
    So, whether this post amounts to anything at all, Im sorry, I have no hard feelings against anyone, its over and done with and IMHO I hope that in future events that I will have the opportunity to fight beside all the people involved.     <p><hr>

Your post is the first I read today, and I have to tell you that it made my day.<br>
<br>
I'm so very glad we can put this behind us, and I don't have words to tell you how much I respect your honesty and candor.<br>
<br>
Most of all, this means we can kick some more butt in the future together without apprehension, and I thank you.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that it was a rough night.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
