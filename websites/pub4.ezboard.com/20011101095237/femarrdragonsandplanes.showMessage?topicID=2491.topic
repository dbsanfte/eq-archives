I really have no reason to post it other than there aren't that many good threads going on, hopefully this will 'enlighten' some people.<br>
<br>
As for what he says about AoR, yeah in a way he was right about some things, mostly the fact that we threw ourselves at things we had no right throwing ourselves at.  Were we Da`Kor wannabes?  Not really, but we did have big goals. <br>

&quot;Gimps, and the Modern World&quot; - By ZoLeN<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
         Hello, I am here today to discuss the wonderful topic of &quot;Gimps, and the modern world&quot;<br>
As most of you know I am Zolen, the barbarian warrior that everyone knows and loves. I in my time have been called everything possible by gimps(I use this word for lack of a better one) my favorite of course being, Elitist Asshole, which I believe some people(gimps) in this guild have actually called me at one time or another, funny, I love being called an elitist asshole, its what I aim for in life... <br>
<br>
        On with the gimps! OK, now I assume most everyone knows what a gimp is? Am I correct class? Well I will define it as it says in the 3rd Edition of ZoLeN's World of Words(wonderful dictionary I suggest everyone goes and buys a copy if they do not own one.)<br>
<br>
Gimp - 1. an underskilled player of any game (n.)<br>
2. to play like an underskilled player (v.)<br>
3. describing something broken (adj.)<br>
Ex. - 1. &quot;Damn that guy is a gimp!&quot;<br>
        2. &quot;Jezus, I am gimping tonight!&quot;<br>
        3. &quot;Dear god, that is one haggard gimp bitch!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now that we all know what a &quot;gimp&quot; is lets move on.<br>
<br>
        I have talked to many people through out my EverQuest career, in the old days I only communicated with skilled players(like myself of course) but now I log on to hear complaints from other overly-skilled players. The world of Norrath has been over run with gimps and wannbes(more on these later.) Many of you I am sure have read my post &quot;The Real Deal&quot; on the Erollisi Marr boards. This post to many seems like bullshit, but to those like myself, it is what we left when we left EverQuest.<br>
<br>
        Now to the point, from what I gather(I gather allot of things) you, AoR, are basically worshipping Da`Kor. I would understand this if it was the old Kor, but it is not. All the members of the new Da`Kor are people that we use to call gimps. When I was in Da`Kor, it was a guild full of overly-skilled players, competent in what they did, minimal people, maximum results, that was our goal. Now even though I now hate most all of the old school Da`Kor, I repect them for what they were, my equals. For you to look up to the new Da`Kor, is like looking up into an Ogres ass(the only things that do this is the feces that come out.) Now notice that I just called you Ogre feces(I would love for everyone to include this in their replies.)<br>
<br>
        I left Avatars of Rage because I could not stand to raid with you. I was very negative during raids because frankly, most of you have no idea what you are doing. I now realize that you will never know what you are doing, the EverQuest population today is generally underskilled with the exception of a few players that come to mind:<br>
<br>
Mitch - Has always been around and will always be around, great monkess.<br>
Chiteng - Has been around since the beginning, one of the best pullers that I have met.<br>
Beba - Old school monk once again, need I say more?<br>
Raand - AKA Rannd, old school, I need not say more.<br>
Kanya - One of the best bards to grace the game. (Dalthar won't agree, but he knows its true)<br>
Burblekutt - Great warrior, has been around forever, he was once known as &quot;Flamminghand&quot;<br>
Naran - again, been around forever, cant remember his old character's name.<br>
Mastello - AKA Kegolan(sorry buddy) has been around forever, great player, have known him for ages.<br>
Cherrywood - haven't known her long, but from what I have seen of her she is a great dr00d.<br>
<br>
These are a few of the skilled players that come to my mind as I am writing this post, I plan on sending it to Dalthar so that he can post it, unless I can find other means of doing so myself. Many a times I tried to offer tips on doing something to your so called &quot;officers&quot; but they always seem to take offense, yes I say it in a very tacky way, but you should listen none the less, because the information I am giving you is first hand. <br>
<br>
        Many of you may remember the few raids that I attended with you. I refused to group with any other cleric besides Dalthar, why you may ask? One reason, clerics are the key to raids, period, no questions about it. Two, in my eyes Dalthar was the only capable cleric on the raids. I am not sure that clerics are anything like they use to be though, if Istavan is considered a good cleric(someone told me this) then I would hate to see a bad cleric.<br>
        <br>
Okay so what have we gathered this far?<br>
<br>
1. AoR is Ogre feces<br>
2. Da`Kor is nothing<br>
3. Why I left<br>
4. Good players<br>
5. Why AoR raids are bunk<br>
<br>
OK now for the gimps, the bad players, the underskilled, the one legged players, the wannabes, without further adu!<br>
<br>
Istavan - Number one gimp on my list, has always been a trashy cleric and shall always remain one.<br>
Bubu - 1st class trash, worthless cheap bubblegum<br>
Kaane - 1st class trash's friend<br>
Itchybottom - 1st class trash's friend's friend<br>
Kimberley - Right up there with Istavan on my cleric shitlist.<br>
Surinam - Always liked to laugh at this fool, he was a wannabe<br>
<br>
        Enough with the gimps, I could go on all night. Now AoR, before I left I was told this was a &quot;raiding guild&quot; and I was asked &quot;Then why did you join a raiding guild?&quot; The reason I joined was because Remedy was in the guild, and a few other reasons also. I was planning on raiding with you all but after a few raids I said forget it. The &quot;we are just out to have fun&quot; attitude is the biggest pile of frog droppings that I have ever heard. You know you aren't just out to have fun, you are out there to try and be the best, period, don't say your not. You want to be uber. So drop the &quot;I just wanna have fun&quot; attitude and try to learn some basic knowledge. Jumping into quicksand isn't the best way to learn, whoever had the idea to go to ToV the other night was really bright(sarcasm) luckily they pulled their heads out and canceled it. You need to start off with something you know you can do. They key to raiding is team work, if the team doesn't exist the raid will fail, and you will continue to be wannabe's. <br>
<br>
        I garuntee you that Da`Kor is laughing at you, I know this, I was in Da`Kor for over 10months. We always use to be &quot;nice&quot; and do CR's for people, all the time. Doing CR's for another guild, makes the other guild look like trash, if you have played to lvl 55+ you should know how to do a CR by now. The easiest way to do a CR in fear is to go to the SW camp in your 2ndary gear(if you don't have any you are a newbie in my book) and fight the mobs that argo you while your Necro summons the bodies to the camp. How much easier could it get? Back in my day we didn't have summon corpse. I recall going from lvl 50 to lvl 46 at a raid one night in fear. Maybe the reason I see everything so clearly is because I have gone through many experiences that you will never be able to experience. I have had at least 3 corpse's rot on raids, this is why we always kept a spare set of gear in the bank, I would suggest you do the same. Yelling for charity from other guilds makes your guild as a whole look bad.<br>
<br>
Enough from me tonight. <br>
<br>
Live, Learn, Love.<br>

This player was a proud member of DaKor.<br>
Whatever he is/was he was made a member of that guild. They accepted him.<br>
<br>
No matter what they say about him now, he is/was DaKor.<br>
Does what he says matter? Only in so far as it shows the true colors and attitudes<br>
of certain guilds.<br>
Do I believe him? Yes of course =) I have no evidence to the contrary to convince<br>
me otherwise.<br>
<br>
You cant have it both ways. They let him in, he is all theirs.<br>
Is the the only one? Not by a long shot. The others just dont admit it in public.<br>

I don' t know if I can take anything seriously that comes out of his mouth. Nice association, next I suppose you'll tell me that all serial killers are crazy there all crazy people are serial killers. Nice deduction. Lemme guess you aced logic? Come on now didn't you have enough the first time? Now you've quit again (How many times was it?) you still try to grasp onto something to slam a guild of which you knew little about. <br>
<br>
Zolen is Zolen he left the guild and that's that. We got along fine and what not. Notice when he made his manifesto it was after he left our guild. Obviously he has continued to hold those feelings for quite sometime. IF he's that way now he's probably been that way for a long time. People are people if you're an ass you going to be an ass whether you are in Da`kor Midnight Sojourn, Affliction Avatars of Rage or whatever guild you are in.<br>
<br>
My point iis to point out the hilarity in taking potshots at people in a game you've quit. Not to mention you don't even know most of the people that were in Da`kor. I do remember you and you were quite an ass to me and my group despite lending us a hand.

your leaving and then not leaving is a habit that a prominent DK member likes to do.<br>
Not something I do.<br>
<br>
Instead of simply denying Zolen's statement as untrue, you attempt to confuse the issue by attacking me. Try addressing the issue raised.<br>
<br>
I want to hear DaKor either disown Zolen or admit he is correct.<br>
If they disown him that means they made a mistake in admitting him.<br>
I would like to hear that also. If Zolen is an ass (unproven) then he is an ass<br>
that DaKor willingly invited into their guild. My assertion is that it was not<br>
a one time only event.<br>
<br>
I dont recall the incident you refer to. If it was the PoH raid, well we killed <br>
Maestro and you guys got what you wanted. It was the least I could do at the time. I dont recall saying more than 10 words to any of you.<br>
None of which were threatening or vulgar. If you expect me to be all happy to see<br>
DaKor in the same zone as me, you expect too much. But I subordinate<br>
my desires to the needs of the Raid/Guild. That is what good players do.<br>
If the raiding party decides they wish to do something, I will do my best to help<br>
achieve that goal. To me that is implicit in being asked to participate.<br>
<br>
It doesnt matter btw if you refuse to take me seriously. Enough people have seen<br>
the validity of the statements to give it credence. I could just as easily say that<br>
defending a guild that no longer actually plays is just as futile. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utuan00dorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuan00Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 774<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/3/01 5:26:12 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guildon</span><hr size=1> Self proclaimed Martin Luther Chiteng, the most perfect person in the world, preaches more nonsense again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usnooganauramaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Snoogan Auramaker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/3/01 5:33:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guildon</span><hr size=1> lol Tuan. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerrolthefury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerrol The Fury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Smartass™</span><br>  Posts: 480<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/3/01 5:47:44 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.valuegiftonline.com/hass.jpg width="108" height="146"></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guildon</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Getyourstuff has defeated Sowecandofear in a duel to the death! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Judging from the refusal of the DK people that have responded so far,<br>

we can infer that they are embarassed.<br>

That is good. They should be. <br>

So is your constant hard on to trash us at every possible opportunity.  Please, I can't say it any clearer to you, and I speak for all of Da`Kor when I say please fuck off and stay gone.  You're pathetic and your shit got old months ago. <p>Kerrol Windfury<br>

Perhaps this will cut short any of your future replies, hopefully in cases where you might question the actions of a Da`Kor member(past or present) in any given situation.<br>
<br>
WE DON’T CARE!<br>
<br>
Would I question the integrity of a fellow Da`Kor member if he or she ran a child-pornography web site, yes sir. Would I question the moral fiber of a Da`Kor brother or sister if they drove a 18-wheeler through an old folks home, you're damn straight. Would I have issues with a Da`Kor member if he or she(Cattie is a wild one) anally raped your mother while pouring sugar in your gas tank, you bet. Would I take offense to Charlize Theron pressing her naked body against mine, no, but that’s not the point…<br>
<br>
Do I care that you somehow feel wronged, put-down, picked-on, pushed-aside, made-fun-of, exploited, made to feel inferior or suffer from a case of virtual penis-envy… in a video game? NOOOOooooooo…! None of us do, so quit fucking crying like a 3-year old girl with a skinned knee. When I say none, I think I speak for the entire EMarr community – just shut_the_fuck_up.<br>
<br>
Seriously, when was the last time any of us even conversed with, around or remotely near you? You can hold a grudge for as long as you want, I guess. Its something to pass the time while you bounced your head off padded walls and have the drool wiped from your chin by men in white uniforms.<br>
