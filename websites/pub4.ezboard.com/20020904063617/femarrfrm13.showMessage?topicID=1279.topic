<br>
I see a lot of people posting on here to lead one Naggy/Vox raid, reserving their epic piece they need and then never doing it again.  Well, i know everyone needs their epic pieces, but it isnt fair to those who dont have the ability or time to put together a well organized raid. <br>
From my personal experiences Naggy is a pus, and Vox will always be an Icy b i t c h.  <br>
So here is my question/proposition. (I am asking because i want some opinions, flame on me or agree i just want to know what you think and if this is possibly viable.)<br>
I would like to &quot;take over&quot; Naggy.  I know that this isnt a reservation board, but i would like to be the next Kerna or Syldra for Naggy.  Why?  I want to do this for many reasons.  I have 2 chars i play, Tulmarian who is a 52 druid, and a monk who is quickly climbing the ladder and is 41 now.  I have no epic pieces i need from Naggy.  I want to lead it because i just flat out love leading Naggy raids.  Anyone who has ever been on a Naggy with me know that i am efficient, and i kill the firery anus with pretty much no problem (1 ranger always has to die on me).  As for pick-up raids, i dont think i have seen one success besides assonance's a while back.  Even my good friend Josiah had trouble leading a successful pick-up.  I am not trying to steal Naggy away from other people, but for the most part the only reason someone steps up to lead is because they want to reserve something for themselves.  I personally have never reserved a first drop of anything and i dont plan on starting.  I will only reserve the seconds of something if i know the person has been stuck in 52 or has been a large part of raiding with me over the course of time and hasnt gotten lucky yet.  I also do not want to give the impression that i am trying to &quot;monopolize&quot; naggy.  I am not going to bring the same 24 people everytime.  I know a lot of people want the opportunity to go on these, and i know how exited i was on my first attemp.<br>
<br>
My point over all is this.  I will lead a successful raid.  I have never failed and i never will.  I would like to &quot;take over&quot; naggy so that it is a guarenteed victory and so people can enjoy the comforts of knowing thier leader.<br>
<br>
I just want to hear what you think about this and whether this is feasible.  And if you are going to rant on my ass, please at least make some intellegent point.  <br>

Unless someone wants to lead who is good, maybe I'll take the responsibility to help the people who haven't yet learned enough to lead until they do. It really does suck having a bad leader and spending 6 hours on a CR for a 2 hour (or so) raid.<br>

Why isn't it fair that I put my hard work in to a raid and I shouldn't get the piece I need for my epic?

So there are pally's that dont have the time to lead a raid that have been in 52 for months because they cant get in on a random cause it is always reserved.  I am not insulting the idea in anyway, i just disagree.  Everyone deserves an equal chance.<br>

If you have such a problem with incompitent peole leading a raid, just KS them.  Parum used to always do that...  Saved a lot of people from doing nasty CRs.  If you have respect, they will follow you, not some shmo who has never been on a dragon raid before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utylothdreamweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyloth Dreamweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/7/02 2:13:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1279.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy?????</span><hr size=1> LOL  way to get off topic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As you said, however, posting on the boards is not in anyway a reservation to the raid (though most respect it).  Post your day and time,  gather your people and go do it!  If someone ignors your post and beats you to it, then @#%$.  DO not cry about it, get up and ready yourself for the next one.  Go until you are satisfied <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However you want to do it is fine.  We may not all agree (or not always) with some of the rules, but it is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  SOMEONES </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> raid and basically what they say goes.  At least until someone gets tired of it and either takes over thier raid or people stop going to thier raid,  whatever.<br>
<br>
No one can, however, give you permission to lead the next Naggy raid, or a series of them, but I say;  If you want to do it do not worry too much what other people want, get off your butt and do it.  Hopefully you can do it without walking over someone elses raid to do it. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=152991>Tyloth Dreamweaver</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=malisey>Malisey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/7/02 7:07:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1279.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy?????</span><hr size=1> I personally don't care who leads the raid, as long as it moves quickly and efficently.

 <br>
I think the 'reserving epic pieces' has gotten out of hand lately and screws over other Paladins like myself (and warriors, bards) who have been 52 for months. I've gone on a few Naggy raids knowing that the first book was reserved for someone, hoping that more than 1 would drop, but naggy the cheap b**tard, isn't giving any extra up. Vox dropped 3, when I won mine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    It's especially irritaing if the person reserving the item and gets it first round, doesn't have the other damn book!! Ok, I'm done bitching...<br>
<br>
If you want to take over naggy, go ahead, just keep things fair. I'm willing to go on 1 or 2 more raids at most, then I'm going to be a hypocrite and lead my own raid and reserve that damn book!<br>

Last time I checked I was leading the next Naggy raid with the book reserved for you.  Is this not your understanding?<br>
<br>
To the origional poster of this thread...<br>
<br>
You are quite out of touch with the current state of Naggy raids.  I have led 6 out of the last 7 Naggy raids on E-Marr.  All have been pickup raids.  All have succeeded.  I got my scale two raids ago, and have continued to lead them at the request of PALADINS who need their book, but who are not interested in leading the raids.  I have gotten one pally his book so far, and I believe I am working towards getting Milasey her book now (however, if she's not aware if this, maybe I was hallucinating the chat we had Wednesday night....)<br>
<br>
In other words, I have been doing EXACTLY what you are proposing in your post, what you are complaining is not being done.  So what are you really ranting about?<br>
<br>
As for pickup raids against dragons having a high failure rate, I agree, this seems to be the case, however, I personally have never led a failed dragon raid, ever.  I'm going on my 20th succesfull raid (counting Vox and Naggy, Vox raids I led as Ailuvian, Naggy I've been doing as Bumamgar)  All of these raids have been pickups.  Some have been &quot;close calls&quot; but never once has the group of people I've brought into the lair failed to destroy the beast and enjoy the loot.  In fact, more often then not, the raids go quickly, the dragon dies fast, and very, very few people die and need rezzes (Best record on Vox is 0 deaths, did that with a 4 group team and only 2 clerics.. that was a fun raid! Best record on Naggy is 1 death, a 44th Monk who knew going in he was too low to survive <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Anyway, not trying to toot my horn or anything, I just get annoyed when someone who is obviously out of touch with the actual events on the server starts spouting off.<br>
<br>
Don't worry though, I'll be 53rd before too much longer, then I'll stop running Naggy raids.  Prolly only have 2 more in me, unless Verant does some more silly patch stuff.<br>

If you don't like the way things are setup on a particular raid then DON'T GO.  Spend your time making alliances and organize your own raid where YOU can set the rules.<br>
<br>
Leading a dragon raid where tons of people ask the same stupid questions a dozen times is a difficult job, and I personally don't care about someone reserving loot as a reward for such hard work.<br>
<br>
As for &quot;taking over naggy&quot;, feel free IMO.  Naggy and Vox go to whomever can get the raid together first.  I always keep my 52 warrior camped near one or the other, I do it mostly for the pure joy of killing them, but also because I want her to get a better haste item <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><B>Festivus Metalpole</B><BR>

Pooganes told me that he asked you if you could reserve the book for me on the next raid, but I don't know what happened after that. I honestly don't expect someone to reserve the book for me, especially someone I don't know. <br>
<br>
It just gets frustrating when I've been to at least 5 naggy raids and have never gotten a chance to roll on the book because it was either reserved or didn't drop. Either way, I appreciate any help I can get. I've been lvl 52, since Feb. and really just want to Ding 53!! I have had the Vox book for a while now and just need the book from naggy.  <br>
<br>
So, I'm sorry if I sound bitchy or like a hypocrite but when you play everyday and have been stuck in the same level for months, it starts getting to you. <br>
<br>
I'll be happy to go on any raids you hold, you're a good raid leader, one of the few that actually knows what the hell they are doing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I like how we all went silent when we ask who needed rezes and no one answered...that was a truly weird moment lol.<br>
<br>
I got a rant here that beats the who’s leading crap...I am tired of having 1-3 people on every raid flip out when they don't win loot. I /rand 1 28 and the guy who had number 8 gets pissed of at me personally for leading a 2hour raid when raids go 3-4 hours often. This has nothing to do with being fair or loot rules or getting loot. This is about people who need to make me feel bad so I have sympathy for them not winning. I LEAD THE DAMN RAID and I didn’t win, good thing that’s not the only reason I am there....I finally won something this last raid out of dumb luck (1 of 23 in on roll). Do people actually believe there is a way to &quot;fix&quot; a roll? lol. This is just like doing a CR where I drag 40 people all at once and save hours then when I go to log and say &quot;GL to you all.. I am logging&quot; 1-3 people say thank you.<br>
<br>
Ohh well I do these raids because you just can't beat the adrenaline of not only being in a big fight, but actually leading one with 40 people expecting you to give them victory. When Vox goes down my fingers are shaking lol... I need a few seconds before I can type. I love the rush! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you guys want to get angry…get angry at the people who join chat 30 min late and expect a ride to the raid. BE ON TIME and these raids would actually be quick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

I knew you had lead some of the successes cezero, but didnt know you had lead so many.  I did know that i have seen people ever since Moridith try to basically KS and fail.  Also everytime i come on the bored i see that the book is reserved for someone.  Maybe i am a bit out of touch, i have been spending a lot of time lvl'ing, i was just proposing an idea.  If you can &quot;take over&quot; Naggy i applaud that.  As for the reservation of the book it is actually something that again i applaud.  You know he is deserving and has paid his dues so its time to get paid.  But as i said in my initial post, i will never reserve the first of anything.  But i do appreciate everyones opinions.  And as for the list of people leading raid and then retiring, i dont remember all the names, but i believe most of them put in a ton of time participation in these raids before they finally lead one.  My rant was on those who would hit 52 lead a raid reserve the book and then never get seen again.  But i do feel everyone deserves a fair chance.  And no life isnt fair, but when there is an opportunity to right something and make it fair, and you have control, why not do it?  Unless you are a selfish @#%$ you might possibly understand this.  <br>
