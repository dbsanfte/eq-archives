<br>
Now I'm sure that one or two &quot;bi-sexual&quot; people reading this thread just did a little experimentation before they made a choice but who knows.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't care what the hell you want to say is a marriage now. For thousands of years man and wife have lived together as a couple and raised children. The fact any of us is here is testament to that fact.<br>
<br>
Before you start with &quot;well different religions have different ways of doing things&quot; even they agree that the word they use the word marriage because its the closest term we have for the arrangements they make. They're not the same.<br>
<br>
We seem to be going through a time of change but I can't help wondering if it will be short lived. 50 years ago the divorce rate was almost nil, 100 years ago the majority of people beleived in a higher power, homosexuality was called deviance and happened in extremely rare cases now recently everything has changed. It seems to me that society is putting it's collective middle finger up at the way that people used to live their lives and are saying &quot;fu&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;ck it, i'm going to do whatever the hell I want to do and woe betide anyone who doesn't approve of it.&quot;<br>

<br>
Other cultures in the world view marriage as a man and his female property or properties. There was even one culture where it was a woman and her male properties. <br>
<br>
Monogamous lifelong commitment exists was not even the norm for relationships in most pre-christian cultures.<br>
<br>
Celtic marriages were renewed annually with the option not to renew. Roman and greek marriages were frequently not a sexual commitment so much as a social/economic commitment. <br>
<br>
In most cultures sex between people of the same gender was not even considered sex because it couldnt produce offspring. It was not even considered taboo in most cultures until the christian age.<br>
<br>
One on one marriage in terms of human history has been a fairly recent development. Even in christian history there have been cases of multiple marriages sanctioned by the christian church. Though most modern translations of the new testament forbid polygamy, early greek translations did not. The words were changed in early translations and stuck.<br>
<br>
The old testament certainly did not forbid polygamy, though it is not practiced in the modern jewish religion mostly due to the fact that most jewish people live under laws developed for christian morals.<br>
<br>
The concept of sexual relationships outside or in addition to marriage being a sin is not unique to christianity but is not so great a transgression as it is in christianity. I think Islam may be more strict on the subject but most other religions that even have rules concerning it do not consider it an irreparable transgression.<br>
<br>
Marriage in most cultures prior to modern times was an economic arrangement more than a personal commitment. And in any economic relationship, love and pleasure may be sought elsewhere. No one usually had problems with this.<br>
<br>
The odus on polygamy and open marriage will probably remain as long as the christian/islamic religions, but, luckily, we live in a time when the last thousand years of prudism are ending. People are becoming more aware intellectually and spiritually. We are beginning to understand that its not all about sexual property. One or two thousand years is not a long time in human history. Four thousand years from now people will probably be shocked at the level of control that people placed on their spouses today, just as we are shocked when we hear about how women were property in centuries past.<br>
<br>
I currently live in a monogamous relationship by choice, not because some one told me I had to. Before we had children Evelle and I frequently shared our bed with other women, heck we even had a girl stay with us on our honeymoon. Our choice to stop having extramarital was for the sake of our children not because we think it is morally wrong, but because we know others teach their children that it is and we don't want our children stigmitized because of mommy and daddy's girlfriends.<br>
<br>
Modern culture is become less controlled and that is a good thing. Now if we could all just learn to respect each others ability to make our own choices we would all be better off.<br>

Because morality is wrong.  Love is a myth.  There's no place left for hopeless romantics or people who live to make another person happy.  <br>
<br>
There are STDs out there, unwanted pregnancies.  Catch em, then take some medicine and get over it.  Have the children aborted, they weren't wanted so they don't deserve to live.  It's your body, not the child's.  It is a shame that a child must die so you can live the way you want to.  It is your life, not the people directly influenced by you.<br>

<br>
Actually, that's wrong.  The fact that I am here has nothing to do with marriage or couples raising children... my mother was single when she had me and was single for years after... atleast until she met the most incredible man on earth who made me his daughter.<br>
<br>
I had both of my children while single, I am not married, but we're still a family... but there is no "man and wife living together as a couple raising children". <br>
<br>
I couldnt tell you what everyone else thinks, I wasnt going to touch this subject because I have too many views on the situation... but for the love of god if its not your wife/husband why does it matter to you?  Are you afraid that if someone else makes the choices they do that it will somehow rub off on the people you are with?  Insecurity that the reality of how normal such lifestyle is will effect you?    <br>
<br>
You say its wrong for a married person to have sex with another... is it ok for him/her to masturbate?  Watch pornography?  Is it ok to fantasize about someone else?  Whether you think its wrong or not, its going to happen... there's no doubt about that.<br>
<br>
Not everyone has the same religious beliefs... <br>
<br>
I dont consider myself bi-sexual, however, I have been with both sexes.  The choices I make are mine to be made, the relationships I have are mine to live, if I was with multiple partners in my marriage WHY WOULD YOU CARE?  If my boyfriend and I have sex with other women WHY WOULD YOU CARE?  <br>
<br>
We're adults, we can make our own decisions... <br>
<br>
People have sex for various reasons...<br>
<br>
If we make the wrong decisions its our problem... not yours.<br>
<br>
Married couples who have open marriages are ok in my book, non-couples who have open relationships are ok too... but why not attack the married men who molest their children instead of grown ups who, while married, have sex with other grown ups?  <br>
<br>
Personally if Im in a relationship with someone I love there is nothing in the world that would make me so much as look at another person.  However, if the point comes in our relationship where the "fun sex" needs a new twist I would see no problem with bringing someone into the relationship for "casual sex".  Its not going to change who I love.<br>

I think you bring out some good points, that being the various STDs out there and abortions of unwanted children.  I won't delve into the abortion topic because that is a very debatable issue but rather ask a couple of questions:<br>
<br>
Jex if you had an open partnership/relationship how would you guarantee that the person you are having casual sex with is disease free?  Do you or  your significant other deserve to die because both of you are open with your relationship?  Could anyone live with the guilt if they had &quot;casual sex&quot; with another person besides their significant other and contracted a fatal illness that they passed down to their significant other?<br>
<br>
I will gladly agree we are all adults and we can and do make our own choices but often times like Mr. Jellybean and a few others have stated we make these decisions without regard to others.  Being an adult is also being aware of what your actions can do to others.  We all screw up from time to time but we learn from it.  <br>
<br>
I guess because I love my wife more then life itself I have a hard time understanding how anyone can just have casual sex?  Sex to me is a deep and intimate experiance that one only gives to that person who he/she truely loves.  Before I was married I had only had sex with one other woman, and it is something I regret doing just because even though I liked her a lot I had yet to understand what love truely is.  <br>
<br>
For those of you that agree on having multiple partners and an open marriage can you give examples of what is more intimate and more precious to give to the one you love more then anything then yourself in mind, body and soul?<br>

<br>
They may have had abortions because they didn't want the child and didn't want to force the child to live with the single parent on minimum wage lifestyle. They felt that if they had the abortion then God could take that childs soul provide it with better parents.<br>
<br>
Of course there are people who have abortions thinking only of themselves. And for those abortions, I would have to say that it is better to have the abortion than force a child to be raised by so selfish a parent anyway. <br>
<br>
I believe that god does not punish the unborn souls. My personal belief would be that god would not punish people who have abortions if they are having them for the right reasons. But that is my belief and I would not force it upon anyone and it is not my place to judge other peoples reasons for their choices or beleifs.<br>
<br>
As far as the STD arguement goes, yes that is a definate concern. Theoretically someone could be careful and not contract STDs, and I would hope that people who still have multiple partners or are with people who have multiple partners would practice safe sex. Most established swingers require regular blood tests and safe sex from their partners. For me, the STD issue is best avoided through pure monogamy. Pure hedonists who throw caution to the wind and have unprotected sex with multiple partners risk the spread of disease. I can't agree with the cautionless lifestyle.<br>

This is not at all a comment on a certain sexual preference being &quot;wrong&quot; by anyone's definition.  On a case by case basis I've got no problem with it, and I can certainly see a correlation between publicly noting that you have non-traditional sexual preferences and having the self-confidence (or whatever) to speak your mind, at length, on other topics.  And certainly this topic would attract the notice of bisexual people, so no, its not an accurate sample.  <br>
<br>
But at any rate, yeah, it stuck out and worried me a bit, but only because I'd like to see women of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> sexual preferences who have strong enough opinions to argue them pointlessly on the internet  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And unless I've totally misremembered something, I'd be curious as to how Siilverain's Catholic faith (that was a chunk of the reason you were offended by the save a child kill a priest signature a while back, right?) meshes with her sexuality... <br>
<br>
As for the actual topic of the thread, I'm with the folks who believe that marriage is a commitment between two people.  The nature of that commitment, however, is up to them entirely.  Marriage can be as much a legal state as an emotional one, and sex can be as much a recreational activity as it is an emotional act - and if (BIG if) both parties are on the same page about what type of relationship they have, and choose to branch out, more power to them.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if someone is desperate enough to keep their partner that they don't make a fuss about behavior that hurts them - that's a whole 'nother story.<br>

<br>
There is no guarantee, but there are ways to protect yourself, I never once said being open meant you had to be careless or unprepared.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Do you or your significant other deserve to die because both of you are open with your relationship? </font><br>
<br>
No one deserves to die... but honestly I can protect myself from sexually transmitted diseases.  Nothing is foolproof but every effort is better than none... I cannot protect myself from car accidents, plane crashes, terrorism, non sexual diseases such as the West Nile Virus etc... I dont live in fear but it doesnt mean Im careless, why should you assume that myself or anyone would not use extreme caution when engaging with anyone... period?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
Could anyone live with the guilt if they had "casual sex" with another person besides their significant other and contracted a fatal illness that they passed down to their significant other?</font><br>
<br>
If they both agreed to the circumstances then hey, sadly, its situation they have to face together.  Now if you ask me if a pregnant woman has multiple partners and passes down a fatal illness to her child I would feel differently, the child didnt say "hey Im cool with you sleeping around and Im able to face the consequenses involved if there are any".  <br>
<br>
If a couple decides to bring someone else into their relationship and they dont think out all of these factors then its something that can bite them in the ass.  I know that personally when my husband and I discussed having another person in our relationship for "sex" we discussed every detail from emotional difficulties to disease and pregnancy... not just how much we wanted to do it.<br>
<br>
Mature people are able to make decisions and think things through, dont assume that the people who live these lifestyles are completely ignorant to the risk factors involved.   <p><font color=yellow>

I love my significant other more than life itself and I have no desire whatsoever to be with anyone but him, not even John Rzeznik (/drool on) could make me have a second thought as to who my heart belongs to.  However, Sex to me is either a deep intimate experience or a fun thing we do because it feels good.  When we do the "deep intimate" sex no one else will be involved... if we are exploring for the purpose of fun and excitement its not such a bad thing to explore and grow together... IF that is what we choose to do.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
For those of you that agree on having multiple partners and an open marriage can you give examples of what is more intimate and more precious to give to the one you love more then anything then yourself in mind, body and soul?</font><br>
<br>
Trusting someone with your mind, body, and soul enough to know that nothing can come between you... and knowing that, as a couple, you are able to explore life together and grasp life with both hands and make the most of everything that is offered to you... together. <p><font color=yellow>

Its very very sad that this is your explaination for some other person sharing your bed.<br>
<br>
I have been married for 5 years now.  First marriage.  I had decided to wait until I was married to have sex.  After I was married, because of complications, my wife and I didn't have sex for 4 years.  That's right, didn't have sex till last year.  I have no regrets, I never thought about cheating on her.<br>
<br>
I just don't understand how anyone would want anything but a one on one deep intimate relationship.  People here are saying that love is one thing and sex is another.  I find that funny from people who are saying how deep love is.  So love is deep but we are just animals.  Not buying, sell something else.<br>
<br>
If you swing and have children you are sick.  If your children know you do then you are even sicker.  <br>
<br>
To the people asking why I care how you live... its simple.  One of the main reason my wife and I don't want children is because they would have to grow up with your children. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

<br>
Now there are religions that allow multiple wives - but when you take a wife you are supposed to be able to provide for her and the children you will have with her.  And you are not allowed to cheat on those wives...<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
To be more specific Catholics can not get a divorce (in the church) for adultery - Marrage is a sacred bond and infidelity is not a reason to break the vow - it is a reason to work out problems.<br>
<br>
Wiccans seem to have the best view (IMO) - do what you want as long as you harm no one - that means if you and your spouse are comfortable with everything do whatever you want - but fooling around without consent (and causing emotianal harm to your spouse) would be against thier views...<br>
<br>
Personally I don't understand how you can commit yourself to one person and then have sex with others - you obviously have not commited yourself to one person - and that *is* the definition of marrage - it may not be what you *want* it to be - and it's not binding of course in a real sense - however humans made the word up - and they made the meaning to be that you don't cheat on your spouse....<br>
<br>
If you don't like it - too bad.  If the world had a different opinion of what the word meant - it would change the definition - until then you are going against the grain.  Have the courage to stick to your views - don't hide behind a word saying 'well that's YOUR definition'.  That just bullshlt.<br>

Much as I hate to inflict logic upon a mind better built for blind prejudice ... if love and sex are separate entities, then love can be as deep as you like and that doesn't change the fact that sex is kinda fun. <br>
Meanwhile, by claiming that love can be deep only if sex is regarded as an important factor in it, I'm a little unclear as to how you can consider yourself to have loved your wife before you slept with her.<br>

Ummm Christians already did this and its the Easter you celebrate today. Find out the roots on Easter, and Christmas for that matter, by looking into the religions of Pagan's from centuries back. That is an entire other thread and topic but I felt it should at least get a mention..<br>
<br>
FYI, I'm NOT bi-sexual and I've never truly explored that venue of life (I was always too self-socially conscious to do that &quot;OMG what would people think?!&quot;). Now I'll admit there is an attraction there but its not something I am going to explore anytime soon seeing I'm married and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> idea of a marriage doesn't allow for that.<br>

Fact is you guys don't want to see past your own noses. HEY! That's fine do what you like. Continue to get all riled up and in arms about something that doesn't involve you but 2 other consenting adults that you probably don't even know. That is the same mindset that keeps racial, religious and sexual preference hate alive today (whether you want to admit to it or not, it is). The world WILL go on once your gone and it WILL be replaced with more open-minded individuals, it is everyday, people like you will become a minority (unless Christians or some other organized religion decides to go on another man hunt &quot;crusade&quot; and cleanse the world of the non-believing filth by conversion or massacre which is very possible. Can you say Osama Binladen?), humanity will eventually become a society where we stop feeling we have to force our personal views on others or damn them for not thinking &quot;your&quot; way and all this won't matter... Actually all this will matter because its discussions like this that have born new insights into the world in a single individual. <br>

That is the most utterly rediculous line of garbage I have ever read.  Where has anyone tried to use the name of Christianity (or Islam for that matter) in this thread?  What you've turned this into is a &quot;religion is evil&quot; thread.  Your persecution of their beliefs is just as wrong as their persecution of yours.  Welcome to hypocricy.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Ssetti, you're right ya know.  Let children grow up in homes where sexual action is open and varied.  Hell, have sex in front of the children!  WITH the children!  If it's so fun and it doesn't hurt anyone, let them in on the game too huh?!  Where do you draw the line.<br>
<br>
Have we, as a socitey, lost all sense of compassion, love?  Where is the romance?  Where is the caring?  Everyone is in such a giant race to please themselves they completely forget that other people are being hurt by your actions.  Other people's hearts are being broken.  Other people very well may be dying... so you can have fun.  So you can do what feels good.  For selfishness.<br>
<br>
How dare you take faithfulness out of the hands of humanity?  How dare you make love into some kind of anecdote that has no power over human emotions?  How can you defend something so repulsive as heartlessness?<br>

She wasn't the first to bring up religion in this thread and the fact that Christians and others have used brute force and terror to get people to see their point of view is not persecution of them, no more than the stating of facts of the Final Solution of WW2 is a persecution of Nazi Germany.<br>

I agree that the Christian and Jewish religions has placed a circumscription upon the way most Western people view matrimony. <br>

Nonetheless, my tirade of earlier remains valid; marriage isn't a thing to carry on swinging. It's a commitment to each other, irrespective of what the Anglican Marriage Service or the Catholic marriages rites may drone on about.<br>
