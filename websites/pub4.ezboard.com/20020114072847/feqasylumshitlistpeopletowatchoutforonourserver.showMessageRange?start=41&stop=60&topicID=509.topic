Seems I am now told we Arm mad, he did nothing wrong and I am being childish for pursuing this.  I have been contacted by several members of his guild, as well as a couple from other guilds which claim to be friends of his who were there when this happened.  Is funny that all they do is tell this to me, where no one else can hear/validate this information.  Oh well, I am happy to see we are obviously making him and people who claim to be his friend nervous.  <br>
<br>
On a side note, although the terms we have used here mean nothing to VI or and CS staff, the community does know that what he did would be frowned upon.  As I am not in a guild, nor was Dominoe or Ghorall the Knights of Vengeance seem to believe we are able to be pushed around.  I have avoided bringing the guild into, as this was Warbreed's mistake but as I know have heard from so many of the guild and they all believe I am wrong I must assume they back him and accept this behavior.  For that note I listed them and hope any that are not like him will come forward on this list and perhaps acknowledge their stance publicly.  As it stands, I am treating them with no respect from this night out.  <br>
<br>
Oh, also if you are going to try to intimidate someone, here's a free tip.  Don't just come to where they are sitting and bother them while they are camping.  Don't claim that you have higher friends and don't be one of the smallest guilds on the server trying to act like you are Conquest or SD or any other of the many quality guilds we have here! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urratiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rratiz</A> at: 5/9/01 4:37:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uowens66.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Owens66</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/9/01 9:45:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> yeah uh huh </span><hr size=1> Damn winsome/whateveryournameis I'm not going to put this in this thread <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Loot Whore:  Someone who's only motivation in the game is to get uber l33ts.  These are generally the people that are against NBG because they don't get phat l33ts.<br>

<br>
and inbreed, being guild leader your actions directly reflect on your guild.  A guild leader is not just someone who invites players that can invite other players.  A guild leader is the ethical pillar of the guild, he enforces his ethics by selecting officers that enforces his own ethics.  So your guild is gonna get dragged through the mud with you, especially since you have represented yourself so poorly here.  So inbreed, you and your Knights of Dishonor enjoy yourselves.  I for one want nothing to do with you or your guild.  If you were just a member of the guild I wouldnt slam your guild, but what if one of your members pull this same shit and we go to your guild.  Obviously your gonna say "cry me a river, your whining skill goes up".  I sympathize with your members who have honor, and I would suggest to them to find a guild with a leadership whose direction is honorable.  As for you inbreed, if you are concerned about your guild members being misrepresented you should elect a new leader to replace you, one with honor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaridwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marid wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/17/01 9:04:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> :re Warbreed</span><hr size=1> Simple and basic I have known and &quot;use to&quot; travel with warbreed.the tactic he used is his own,labled rake and reward. step 1) rush in and pull prefered target. step 2) train to any nearby groups with over 4 members to weaken train. step 2a) all the while taping the /yell macro for text logs to save his tail. step 3) short hop gate to nearest zone zone and double back to judge results before engaging leftover monsters/or out loot survivors before they get to half health.<br>

It is easy to blame someone else for your shortcomings. I truly do apologize and feel bad for those who did die such as dominoe and ghollran. Just think about this, with as many people in the game who are barely game age and run around and cry, beg, and want everything handed to em. These are probably the same people who post many of these accuse etc etc. I am sorry if you felt wronged, I am sorry you died. It is easier to proclaim guilt than to prove you are not. Everything I have written, even those two who did write something decent (thanks btw) got slammed by everyone else. I may not be of your highest moral character and live up to your standards. I even know some of my guild members have been asked what was going on and have been harrassed. I guess sometimes those who reside in glass houses launch boulders.
