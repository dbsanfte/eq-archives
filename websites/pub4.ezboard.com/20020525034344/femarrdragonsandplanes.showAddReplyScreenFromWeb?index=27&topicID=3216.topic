I believe I spent more than 20% there, but who know's? Apparently Fystie and Feldynn was keeping some kind of log. I must have misunderstood though because I was under the impression that Fystie held the camp about 2 hours a night while her brother had my character up on another computer the rest of the night because he played at night anyway. They knew I worked a full time job going into the camp and didn't seem to have a problem with it. Oh wait! That was before all this. Angelmyste held the camp all day from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm. Where are you Angel? I don't hear you whining and complaining.<br>
<br>
Oh by the way Fite, I don't believe we saw you there at all. As a matter of fact I didn't even know you was in our guild. Wait, I think I've seen you online about twice this year. Let me guess, your a long time friend of Fystie. <br>
<br>
You guys are too funny, if you spent half the time rebuilding Eternal Haven as you did trying to rip us apart you'd probably be back to full scale now. <br>
<br>
Don't you realize we don't care what you think at this point. Do you really think anybody else cares that doesn't know us? Don't you realize the more you say the more you sound like a bunch of pathetic loosers! <br>
<br>
Relax Fystie, nobody blames you for the loss of members in Eternal Haven and if they blame Me, Ledandade, Danix, Angelmyste, Dein or anybody else that you've mentioned in this forum...WE DON'T CARE! we know the truth about what happened!<br>

I doubt she would mind spending that much time at the camp considering that she was the next Cleric in line. She is not complaining about it now because she left with you. I like how you leave out the little details in your posts, the little details that would turn the whole story around. <br>
<br>
I started posting as Fite Mah because Mavrin has left the server to join some real life friends. I wanted everyone to be familiar with the name of the character that I currently play on Erollisi Marr, so that I do I not mislead anyone. I do not play as often as I use to, and the hours that I play now are different. I am normally getting on about the time that you are logging off. <br>
<br>
I was not in Skyfire to help with your epic, but I was on at the time that you all were calling everyone and I was asking my friends to come help. If a level 49 Monk would have been of service to you, I would have gladly joined in the fight. At that point I felt really bad for taking Mavrin to another server, but in the long run I knew that a group of real life friends who always played at the same time would be a better match for her. I have gotten Fite another two levels since that time and I find myself playing on Erollisi Marr more and more.<br>
<br>
I posted this flame because you took advantage of some of the nicest people that I have ever met, in game or out, and I did not want the same thing to happen to anyone else. <br>

<br>
Fact .. steps were taken to create that guild WHILE a large portion of EH officers were on vacation <br>
<br>
Fact .. members of EH were lied to and deceived by founders of Endless Prophecy in order to recruit WHILE EH officers were on vacation<br>
<br>
Fact .. officers of EH were lied to by now ex officers (and founders of EP) regarding the creation of the guild and were never given the chance to try and resolve the matter before the guild was created and people left EH.. why?? because it all took place in secret and was carried out WHILE EH officers were on vacation.<br>
<br>
Supposition .. Endless Prophecy was founded on a base of secrecy, deceit and lies??<br>
<br>
Conclusion .. the split guild from EH and the &quot;recruiting&quot; was premeditated and carried out in such a way that those who did not actively support Caelie and the grudge she bore against an ex EH member (and for the record never supported the actions of the person she held such hatred for, or her for that matter) never had a chance to defend themselves or their guild.<br>
<br>
And you have the nerve to accuse us of treachery and backstabbing??<br>

<br>
is it or is it not true that:<br>
<br>
Trilok and Fystie are friends with an individual who flamed both our guild and some guild members on a public board.<br>
<br>
Is in not true that Trilok left the guild when protests started about that individual and around the same time that individual's wife cussed a member of our guild in tells while online?  Our leader's response was to go hunt with him some more.<br>
<br>
Did trilok not prefer the company of this individual over his guildmates in eternal haven saying nobody was gonna tell him who to hunt with, even though we told him how we felt.<br>
<br>
Did Trilok not leave eternal haven (but he must be back now) and proceed to hunt with this individual?<br>
<br>
Did Fystie not post a message that basically said she was considering disbanding EH when she got back.<br>
<br>
Is it not true that Trilok occasionally gets on other guilds message boards and cusses and rants like a banshee much to the embarrasment of some of his guild mates.<br>
<br>
Just tell the truth... will be good for your soul.<br>
<br>
You wanna talk about back stabbing picture this... your guild leaders are hunting with a guy who flamed you and the very guild they lead.  If im in a guild I expect your loyalty, just like you expect mine.  You have the gaul to get on this board and talk about treachery... well so be it, when all is said and done here the true treachery will be exposed.<br>
<br>
Now to set the record straight.  The new guild idea was discussed because the future of Eternal Haven looked very dim.  It was formed with the intention of being a safety net so that the members who wanted to hunt together could continue along with a minimum of disruption if you did disband the guild.  In fact it was formed with alts to that end. I was the first to leave EH when instead of addressing a genuine complaint from guildmembers it was ignored and excuses made.  I dont regret my decision.  Now that you have shown your true faces I am certain i made the right decision.  There were many people who felt as I did. I know its hard for you to believe but we didnt steal your guild... you ran it off...  Do you really think that we are holding these people prisoner here?  /Guildremove works in EP just like it did in EH.<br>
<br>
FACT: Caelie was not present in any form so I dont know where Trilok is getting his info, or if he is just pulling it out of his rear end. no alt of hers was present and she was not even online.  I know this for a fact.  I was trying to log her in to do it but didnt know her password.  If i could have gotten her online she would have been there.  She was not home at that time, she was with her mom (who has cancer) at the hospital, more important than Everquest i believe.  She was aware of the discussions about the new guild but was unable to participate.  It was 2 nights later before she was able to get online and join the new guild.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you guys are trying to do here... You may think you are hurting EP or the members when in fact the only thing you are doing is hurting yourself, your credibility and the future of EH. <br>

<br>
1.  Yes, also note that I am friends with said person who flamed us almost a year ago.<br>
<br>
2.  Don't know .. I do know that the wife cussing incident wasn't condoned by Trilok or anyone else friends with said female cusser.  Also Trilok (your leader at the time) did I believe call those 2 people (individual and cussing wife) and proceed to rip them a new @#%$ about it.<br>
<br>
3.  XP group is an XP group.. do you think he would blow off a guild group because his friends yell &quot;jump&quot;??  I don't, and I never did that either even though I did hunt with the individual.<br>
<br>
4.  See answer 3, I (and I'd imagine Trilok also) would much rather hunt with friends over a regular pickup group.<br>
<br>
5.  Yes Fystie did post that she was considering disbanding the guild on return, but it was on the last day of our vacation and the first time we'd read the boards so perhaps it was just a snap reaction post in response to a bunch of other officers saying they were leaving??  Either way no one waited till we were actually back to find out what was going to happen.<br>
<br>
6.  Yes he did, but that was in defense of our guild.. so maybe you didn't like his style.  That's ok I don't think I actually liked it either, but in case you weren't aware Trilok did actually discuss it with the leader of that other guild and promptly apologised and that situation was resolved.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> --------</center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Do you remember when some of us jumped up and tried to defend Caelie when she had troubles with a former guild??<br>
<br>
Also do take note that you guys had chosen to discussing the creation of EP a while BEFORE we went on vacation, AND it was discussed in secret then steps were taken to create EP WHILE we were away and all that BEFORE Fystie posted.<br>
<br>
If the creation of the new guild was just a safety net why didn't you choose to share it with the rest of us instead of keeping it secret huh?<br>
<br>
So what was the issue that was ignored??  Is it that Caelie has / had a major grudge against an ex guildmember and friend of some officers because of an incident that happened nearly a year ago and had been mostly forgotten, said person actually left the game for maybe 6 months or so too then after a few weeks of being back crap starts happening again because of an old incident most of us had chosen to actually forget about.. oh and BTW I don't think any of us actually condoned the original flame thing either, but that probably doesn't matter right?<br>
<br>
Did anyone ever say Caelie or her alts were involved in the creation of EP??<br>
<br>
What I'd like to know is why we were lied to about a whole bunch of stuff surrounding EP and it's creation, why the whole thing was kept secret and all happened while people were on vacation .. and why did this whole mess between Caelie and the individual rear it's ugly head after 6 months of them not even playing and not broadcasting their return??  <br>
<br>
From my perspective this whole sorry mess is down to a few people being childish, holding grudges over stuff that really should have been forgotten a long time ago, making assumptions about other people because of their friends and generally acting like 5th graders .. but then that's just my opinion /shrug. <p><center>--------<center>

Read back over this board and see who is being childish.  We are not flaming you guys on an every minute basis.<br>
<br>
We didnt start this flaming process and if you think you will be allowed to say anything you wish here with out the truth being said you are sadly mistaken.  There were plenty of chances for meaningful discussion but the chances finally ran out.  You keep saying talking about how it was done while you were out of town.. the issues that finally broke the camels back happened while you were out of town.  I don't believe in my case anyway, your being in or out of town wouldn't have mattered.<br>
<br>
I also noticed that not one time did you say anything i said was wrong.  you just dont approve of the way we went about it.  Thats ok too.  We didnt approve of some things that were goin on and we handled it.  So how long do we go on with this embarassing spectacular in public?  It seems you dont want to face the real reason for the division.  Thats ok too.  So rather than accept it we are gonna get on this board night after night and talk about each other.. I probably wont be partcipating to much.  <br>
<br>
You obviously think the issues with the ex guildy was a minor thing, and you missed the boat much like the people you are defending... not everyone saw it as minor....  You just chose to pretend it was minor..<br>
<br>
keep fussin about when the guild was created, and how you never had a chance to discuss it and all that.. Keep talkin about caelie and what a rotten person she is.  My advice is to look and see what is the real reason people left EH.  Learn from it and dont make those same mistakes again... or... just keep typing away on the Emarr board.. Now go back and read my post again.  Leave off all the sidebars and excuses and answer those questions.  Then you will know everything you need to know about why we left.<br>
<br>
And oh btw  Fite mah or whatever your name is ... you dint care enought about your mates to stay on the same server with em but it is important enough for you to get on this board and talk about something you have absolutely no knowledge of.  Go back to sleep.<br>

What were the issues that finally broke the camels back??  They happened while we were out of town so we have no clue what went on but maybe if we were around we could have stopped it, who knows.  But the facts still stand that things were planned and organised in secret before we went and carried them out while we were away /shrug<br>
<br>
The truth can be represented in more than one way Az, I didn't say what you said was wrong but I did add a few details you chose not too .. anyone can tell the truth in such a way that looks favourable to them and less so to others.<br>
<br>
Are you embarassed by this public spectacle??  Yes this whole mess should never have been brought up here IMHO, but defending myself and my guild is certainly not an embarassment for me.<br>
<br>
Maybe I have missed something or perhaps my rose tinted shades or laid back attitude are preventing me from seeing the &quot;real&quot; reason for the division so please.. tell us what is the real reason?<br>
<br>
Ok lets look at the ex guildy issue for a sec... he flamed my guild, you don't think that made me mad??  Well actually it probably did, BUT that whole incident was almost a year ago now.  The flamer subsequently quit the game for 6 months or more then came back unannounced .. believe it or not in those 6 months or however long it was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I got over it!!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
I went back and read your questions again, and I think what you're implying is that I didn't answer them in the way you wanted or in a way that made those not on &quot;your side&quot; look at fault.  All I did was add a few facts to the truthful statements you made.<br>
<br>
As for Fite Mah, well she cared about her RL friends enough to move to their server .. BUT guess what, she also had feelings for and cared about us enough to keep one of her characters (Fite) on this server and does infact play quite regularly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Caelie,<br>
Everything so far as I remember was all fairly good for 6-8 months after the person you held an unholy grudge against was NOT playing EQ, as in had for all intents and purposes quit the game.  Yet you brought up this dispute over and over again, whined and complained and bitched about him and his friends .. you brought up issues that to most of us were long since deceased, pointed fingers at us accused us of doing all sorts of things, and you wonder why a couple of officers felt the need to leave??  We tried to tell you it was over, you wouldn't believe us /shrug.  History should have been left in where it belonged.. in the past, but you couldn't and wouldn't let it lie.<br>
<br>
If I thought the whole affair, then and now, was no big deal do you really think I would be posting right now??  Yes I do have a laid back attitude to life EQ and most everything, yes I don't like confrontation, maybe I do try to play things down in order to keep the peace .. or maybe, just maybe I had actually gotten over the whole flaming incident 8-10 months ago especially since that person had left EQ and moved on to better things.  <br>
<br>
Believe it or not I do actually think it's a big deal .. it's a big deal that a couple of people couldn't put some childish crap behind them that happened like 8-10 months ago, it's a big deal that it's caused such a horrible horribe mess .. the part that really is no big deal to me is what actually happened all that time ago, I got over it that's why it's no longer a big deal for me.<br>
<br>
I've been attacked on a personal level in RL before hell I've had problems with my parents before and I've even had my boss take a shot at me for something I didn't do, but I deal with it and shortly after I get over the whole thing.  I don't let things fester and bubble away for almost a year and then get all upset when most others involved in the original issue have got over it.  But.. that's just me, the way I am.<br>

This has gone on for far too long already and now it seems that some others are experiencing what I have already been through with Caelie.<br>
<br>
There is ALOT more to this story that I'm sure no one wants exposed on this forum and it should be LEFT alone for the sanity of all involved. There are only losers here on all sides and is a case of mutually assured destruction. Without getting into any details its a simple issue and in retrospect was stupid then and is stupid now.<br>
<br>
My wife and I left the GAME because of unresolvable conflicts with a few guildmembers. One of those guildmembers chose to flame us to every person we knew and I chose to flame back. We left the game for 6 months and come back and the very same @#%$ starts as soon as that person realized we were back. My wife sent a single tell to one of the parties saying &quot;@#%$ you&quot; (childish I know but emotions get in the way) and I (as I was guildremoving my daughters twink from EH) made a joke about a &quot;clique&quot; that said member claimed we had (mind you that both of these stupid comments were made after they began to barrage our friends with bs).<br>
 Its a case of completely petty bullshit and as Nogem said so well.....&quot;learn to give a @#%$ less&quot;....I certainly do.<br>
<br>
As for allegations that I flamed the guild then I suggest you learn how to read. As I said on the EH board I am so done with this. Its way too old already and everyone involved just needs to accept responsibility for their actions (and NO ONE involved in this entire foolish mess is innocent in the least) and get over it. WE ALL had a part in this entire mess and it's time to let it go and move on. <br>
<br>
That is about as unbiased and honest assessment of the situation as I am capable of giving. Good luck to all involved  <p>Cryptte Swiftkyl<BR>

<br>
This really needs to end now, I understand the base emotional need to defend oneself, however, this is getting petty. I was not, initially, involved in this conflict, and I don't want to be dragged into it any more than I have been. I have friends in both guilds, and I wish to retain them.<br>
<br>
Please, for the sake of those who are getting caught in the middle, please let it go. If you feel the need to argue or &quot;one up&quot; eachother, take it to a private forum, or set up special &quot;screw you&quot; email accounts and use those.<br>
<br>
I hope those involved in this issue that I am close with (you know who you are) don't take this post the wrong way, I just hate seeing, what amounts to, schoolyard bickering. By now, with the amount of posts, from both sides, people have already made their own decisions. It is unlikely that any new post to a public area is going to change this. You should concentrate on maintaining the friendships you have now. Agree to disagree and move on. Please?<br>
<br>
Peace all, I am out.<br>
<br>
P.S. I have made my decision, and I am not going to change it. I am well aware of the issue on both sides, and have discussed my feelings with those that, IMO, need to know.<br>
