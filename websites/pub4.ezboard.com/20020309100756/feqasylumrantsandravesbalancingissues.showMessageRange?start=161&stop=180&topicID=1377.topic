I would really like the bad blood to stop.  <br>
<br>
I really don't like posting on these boards because of the flame wars.  But,  I felt it necessary, to say that I talked to Famile, She seems like a very nice person.  She had her reasons for not wanting to rez Riders members.  I support her decision.  It is every service class right to assist who they want.  We talked and I think that she is willing to give RoA members another chance.  Since the incidents that happen to her, happened a long time ago, and the butthead members are most likely not in the guild anymore.  Although with the stuff on this board.  I wouldn't blame her if she went back to her old policy.<br>
<br>
I also wanted to mention, that yes Riders has had its share of people on the shit list.  But, Riders is a 2 year old guild.  Some of the shitlistees mentioned above left the guild before I even joined a year ago.  I honestly think that Riders has a good crew of people right now.  Try not to judge the guild for, people that have been weeded out a long time ago.<br>

That's totally against our policy.  We have told our members time and time again that this will not be tolerated.  <br>
<br>
I never said ROA was perfect, but I am asking what did we do to recieve such treatment as this?  Unless ALL of our members are bad, there is no logic to running around saying &quot;sorry i won't rez ROA&quot;.  I ask again, how would that be helping the situation?  I can tell from some FL posts that you guys want to be treated with some respect, but clearly this is not the way to go about it.<br>
<br>
Let's clear another thing up - I'm not attacking Famile.  I'm questioning why you want respect and turn around and do this.  I have no ill will towards Famile at all.<br>
<br>
Simc there is no difference whether they were grouped or not.  She can choose to rez a member of her group.  That is her choice.  Whether they are grouped or not doesn't make it any worse or any better.<br>

<br>
She can dislike our guild all she wants, it doesn't mean she has to run around saying &quot;I won't rez ROA&quot;.  It's certainly her choice to do so, the question is is it a bad or good choice?<br>
<br>
I agree Mascen, bring them out I would very much like to see them as well.<br>

Gusiam and I did chat, and I descided to give RoA another chance.  To group with you guys, rez you, etc.  You have just wasted your second chance.  Don't flame me.  Talk to me.  You want answers, ask me.  Don't ever attack me.  <br>
As for what happened with Cinque...<br>
I was starting to waver with my descition and starting to give RoA another chance by say grouping with people I didn't know.  Cin was often AFK, he'd jump off of Named and train to the zone, etc.  He was NOT in the group when I refused to rez him, and he WAS REZED!  Nokk dragged his corpse to a Cleric that could rez, and got him a rez. <br>
I do not voice my opinions about RoA to anyone except my husband, Ihnzo.  I don't bash RoA in guildchat.  I don't post things about then and I don't flame them.  I also don't group with them or rez them.   If I get invited to a group with RoA, I send the leader a tell simply saying &quot;I'm sorry, I don't group with RoA&quot;  I try and find them another Cleric and go back to LFG.  I don't throw a fit, I don't make them choose &quot;me or the RoA&quot;  nothing like that.  I don't feel the need to.  I don't care if other people like/dislike them.  I know how I feel and where I stand.  Period...the end.  Please don't make this a big issue.  Don't waste people's time with how I feel about your guild.  Honestly, these people would never have known your true colors and how much you like to throw a fit like my toddler if it wasn't for you starting this.  If you have a problem with ME, tell ME.  Send me a tell.  Ask me in game for my e-mail and send me spam everyday telling me how much you hate me, but don't waste the Lanys community's time with it.  <br>
<br>

So as soon as you don't think like another person you'll start to flame? If she dosen't feel like rezzing soneone she don't HAVE to whatever the reasons are. End of the line.<br>

I don't can if that person was Jack the Ripper, if they were ok enough to group with to get exp, then they sure are good enought to res. <br>
<br>
I also don't belive in blacklisting a whole group/guild/class/ (fill in the blank) because you have a problem with one or two people in the entity. IMO that is pretty immature and unfair, but then there is no requirement that a cleric act like an adult either. Are all of FLs (or any other guild for that matter) perfect people. Nope (I know that comes as a shock guys *wink*), should I not res anyone in FL? I think some friends in FL might have a thing or two to say to me if I started doing that.<br>
<br>
Do I have a DNR list? You betcha. There are a few people on this server I will not res, buff, heal or give the time of day too. I will however NOT be grouping with them either. I will stay LFG before I group with them. <br>
<br>
My understanding was that they were still grouped when he died. (In my conversation with her shortly after this happened, she did not say she was not grouped with him. she said they got someone else to do the res. /shrug)  If that is not the case then not ressing him is a vaild choice. Though I still think it is pretty lame to be willing to let him get you some exp. If you are gonna ride on a high horse. Then stay up there, the jumping in and out of the saddle usually ends up getting you a nasty bruise by landing on the saddle horn.<br>
<br>
P.S<br>
 His being AFK or a bad puller or whatever is irrelevant to this conversation. We all know what to do by now in a situation like that. ...&quot;Oh drat, look at the time, gotta go wash my hair, disbanding&quot;<br>

<br>
Cinque is far from innocent. He's a complete idiot. He falls from the ramps like someone tied an anvil to him and keeps throwing it over the ledge. He certainly doesn't say the same stuff that Cinque used to, doesn't know the same stuff that Cinque used to, he doesn't even shout 'ninja dorf' anymore.<br>
<br>
She may not know him, but his failure to even play his character correctly may fill in what she doesn't know.<br>

Funny, you yourself said it was a 'slam' a couple pages ago, now it's your own self-righteous quest to guide Famile towards good deeds. <br>
<br>
At least your logic is consistent.

She does not advertise her dislike for RoA she keeps that to herself and tries her damndest to stay away from RoA if and at all possible...<br>
  Gusiam talked with her and asked for you all to be given a second chance... She had also agreed thus yesterday we did group with a RoA member and that person acted with honor. <br>
<br>
    Honestly all I have seen is a attack on her by a RoA member and no other RoA comments to validate her TO Rezz... Hell if I was in her position and all I got were attacks I would add all of you with the tag to DNR list... Simply by association thats all she could ever expect. Now mind you stated before hand &quot;Guilt&quot; by association has been viewed and has been used against guilds. <br>
<br>
I personally like some in RoA  and others I simply can't stand; however the feeling is mutual. I However will support my wife 100% and stand next to her as the next self righteous ass will pass judgement for something she believes in.  <p><center><a href="community.webshots.com/photo/19941107/19941418FcRUyNfmMI/"target"="web"><img src = "http://wsphotofews.excite.com/036/z1/hd/Sk/WG16042.jpg"WIDTH=275HEIGHT=275 BORDER=0>

Well just answer this - What helps the situation more, helping or not helping? <br>
<br>
Jeka if you or anyone else wants to call it an attack that's fine.  It's just my opinion.  If you think it's an attack, then look at how she refused to help an innocent person.<br>

I see no mention of her 'actions' being the target of your flame in that sentence, nor do I see her 'actions' being the spot of blame in ANY of your posts in the first place.<br>

Unless that happens to be another thing that was conveniently left out and that you meant to put in, or perhaps worded/stated incorrectly...<br>
<br>
I'm finished with you, you're alone in your beliefs, and you've failed to even explain or justify them in a consistent manner.<br>
