<br>
So far we've got Razbollox being a total fuckwit, which to most of us was not what you would call news.<br>
<br>
And then you have Titanias being a total fuckwit because he's left the game and doesn't give a shit about anyone who plays EQ.<br>

Its over. I baried the hatchet last nite. Me and Raz are kool. Tits still an asshole though but he cant help himself. It was never my sword and not my responsiblity to retrieve it.  It belonged to Domination and they are dead now just like Titanias. I dont remember why I was trying to get the sword back for them in the first place and received more tells than actual support on the project it seems. Like I said, Im a cleric I dont need no stinking sword! If Domination or the former members that want the sword back let them deal with it. As far as Im concerned its Raz's for as long as he wants and to do with as he pleases. I apologize for calling Razboinik names and realize he is no thief or terrorist. The real thief here was Titanias who gave away something that did not belong to him to cause harm and chaos (and breaking hes promise to boot). And it worked! Good job! Im glad you've left EQ. Now I have to deal with him in DAoc though. I sure hope hes a better DAoC player than he was on EQ.<br>

Wheres all my shit? huh you sold it or gave it to you twink is what u did.  Did I email razboinik about the sword NO. You jump on my computer and did it.  Wheres all the shit on my accounts. the cobalt, Bps, all that shit.   Prob sold in ec FUCK YOU.  Who in the guild got the incardine BP or all those FBSS?? was it the guild NO U.  I remember HOW I GOT IT it was won on a roll that non guildies were allowed to roll on and i won it.  You were not even an officer at the time so HOW THE HELL DID YOU MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE SWORD.  Raz was an officer so he should know.  YOu took over 4+ accounts all with 50+ chars on them that were all a part of domination.  Did all there shit go to guild NO it went ot you.  YOu wanted that fucken sword too but didnt get it so you go all crying about it.  FUCK YOU.  YOu were not even going to give that sword to Blackmoon or anyone in the guild you wanted it for your twink.  SO Kiss my ass and post all the bullshit you want.   Razboinik was still a part of domination when i left and he got ONE FUCKEN PIECE of equipment from me.  YOu got all the rest.  But it wasnt enought for you.  So I DID GIVE IT TO THE GUILD YOU WHORE.  The loot rules when i left was that all the equipment was goint to be givent to the highest members of the guild and if they didnt need it THE OFFICERS WOULD DECIDE WHO GOT WHAT.  YOU AND HIM WERE BOTH OFFICERS.  hmmm SO IM A LIAR CAUSE I GAVE IT TO AN OFFICER OF DOMINATION or AM I A LIAR CAUSE I DIDNT GIVE IT TO YOU.  YOur just pissed cause YOu didnt get the GOD DAMN SWORD for your twink wippor.  Where are all the other officers of domination THALYNTAR, SIGHTER, HORIZ, all the rest who were actually officers of domination at the time.  LET THEM POST ABOUT THE FUCKEN DECISION ABOUT THE SWORD.  WHAT NO RESPONSE FROM THEM.  THats what i fucken thought.  YOu made the whole shit up.  You told your story to the guild after raz left with the sword just to make raz look bad and hopefully you can get your little sword back to your twink.  <br>
<br>
If anyone from domination is reading this I want to know.  WHo has my cobalt armor?  WHo has the incardine BP?  where is all my wizard shit.  wheres the 50+ cleric shit?? the DRUID SHIT??  Did it go to the guild???  If not i think you can prob find your answer to where the sword would have gone too.  Where is the 50+ necro shit the 50+ monk shit from the accounts you took over???? anyone in the guild get any of that????   <br>
<br>
And if any officers of domination read this THAT WERE OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE SWORD DROP please post here for all to see about the decision about the sword.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/useverene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>severene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://155.187.10.12/images/icons/skull.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/2/01 10:00:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Razboinik and The Edge of the Nightwalker</span><hr size=1> Whats this? A disembodied head making all this racket? You have no char on EQ! Shush you! Once again you know not what you spake! BTW - I challenge you to a duel in EC, wait NM you cant fight with no body!<br>
<br>
1) You PROMISED me EVERYTHING on all accounts to do with as I pleased, &quot;Dont worry Im givin you everything, including the sword.&quot;  You lied to me and gave out the weapons after promising them to me. Insert knife &lt;here&gt; into my back. Theres a big slot there from previous wounds so it should be easy to find.<br>
<br>
2) I took a few odds and ends for cleric items and GAVE the other items to guildies. I gave yer accounts to Lukaria and Barridor. Lukaria has the war stuff for Titanias and I gave her some cleric items too.  Barridor has the rest. I GAVE that BP to Razmar. Most of the crap I got from you was twink stuff for newbies anyway. With the outflux of people from EQ it wouldnt fetch on market anywhere near what your thinking even if I could have found a buyer.  WHoopie what a motherlode. Level 50 and lower items. You war was still wearing newbie blue armor for petes sakes except for a few items. I took the items from you and the accounts so they would be used instead of sink into oblivion.<br>
<br>
3) I wasnt going to give the sword to my twink, I planned on giving it to BMX. I still care about EQ and the people that were loyal enough to continue playing with me and was willing to fit them up proper. I never got that chance though because you wanted to ruin EQ for me so I would stop playing. Well it just about has. <br>
<br>
Analogy:<br>
Let me tell you a story. One day we were all playing baseball in the yard. Titanias has the best glove there. Titanias decides to go play soccer. He promised to leave the glove with me for the team to use. Instead at the last minute he throws it over the fence where wild boars chew it up so that none of us can play with it. Then says &quot;Hey come with me and play soccer instead! Baseball sucks ass!&quot;<br>
<br>
And you better stop cussing at me little boy. Im not some anonymous jerk in Wyoming that you've never seen that cant reach across the table and bitchslap you silly.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

SO - enjoy your sword you sorry ass mother fucker. Cram it up your ass where it belongs you peice of shit. You can kiss my ass. You heard Titanias its yours man! He changed his mind I guess and hes intitled to do that because this is America! He promised ME that sword and it was suppose to stay in the guild. You would think he would give it to hes RL bud, but he can lie to me just as well you instead I guess. I was in full support of him giving you the sword - as long as you stayed in the guild. Hes just spoiling the game (eq) for me to force me to DAoC. Just like the Russians burned the lands as Nazis advanced hes trying to ruin the game for me because he doenst want me to play it anymore. Some people just arent very reliable it seems. You OR him.You and him can go in the back and yank each other off with it if you want. Your a sorry low life piece of terrorist shit. You've been nothing but a pain in the ass since the first time I met you! Just go away and kill yourself with the fucking thing for all I care! <br>

An anology.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you a story. One day we were all playing baseball in the yard. Titanias has the best glove there and told razboinik he could have it when he retired. Titanias decides to go play soccer. He promised to leave the glove with me for the TEAM TO USE. Instead at the last minute he gives the glove to razboinik who is still on the TEAM (a captain) and every thing else he owns to severene (a captain). Titanias is thinking hey when razboinik gets a better glove he will pass this glove down for others to use and so forth.  Then one day Razbonik left the team taking the glove with him.  Then severen says HEY TITANIAS YOUR A LYING BASTARD.  GO FUCK YOUR SELF TITANIAS THAT GLOVE WAS FOR THE TEAM THAT RAZ WAS ON AND LEFT.  I HATE YOU TITANIAS.  ITS YOUR FAULT TITANIAS.  GO MASTERBATE WITH RAZBOINIK.  Titanias who is playing soccer says im sorry i gave the glove to raz cause i promised it to him and he was on our team. I did not know he would leave the team  But now that he isnt i cant do anything about it.  DOnt scream at me.  Come play soccer with me.  NO FUCK YOU TITANIAS YOUR A LYING BACKSTABBING ASSHOLE WHO PROMISED THE SWORD TO ME er uh THE TEAM.  <br>

Heres the real problem here: You didnt trust me enough to hand me the sword. I had a vested interest in the game and you did not because you were leaving. Someobody you know in RL standing there and you dont trust me. You thought I will give it to my twink instead of someone in our guild. Thanks for that trust. It means alot to me!<br>

Titan, rest at ease, I was given several itemsfor the warrior.  In fact, I can play titan without being totally embarrassed=P  I don't know what armor or weaps you had before tho, so I cannot answer where everything is.  However, be reassured that I have been reoutfitted.  Luk also has the dawnfire so..<br>
<br>
Ok you two have fun some more.<br>
