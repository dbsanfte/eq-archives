While I am not a US Citizen, I've been living in the USA for 18 years and consider it my adopted homeland. I just spent the entire day (8AM till 1AM) watching the CNN in total horrified shock. I am sickened to know that some people have so much hate in they're hearts to do such things to innocent people. Now to the real meat of this message:<br>
<br>
<b> Stop blaming all of Islam for the actions of a few fanaticals! </b><br>
<br>
I know that many people who are saying "kill em all" or "anyone wearing a rag better watch out" or some other bullshit like that, are first of all very childish... and considering the sudden stress of current events are angry and venting out their fustrations. Most of them don't mean it, or are just full of hot air. Still it is annoying to see ignorent childish little pricks foaming at the the mouth, blindly and stupidly lashing out at anyone and anything that has anything to do with Islam, instead of using thier heads and realizing who is really responsible. <br>
<br>
If, you are like me, and wanted to be <b>educated</b> before making up you opinions, I suggest you read up about the history of the middle east. I did just that and realized what a beautiful culture the various peoples of the middle east have. These are not evil people. They're religion teaches love and respect for one and other. <b>Do not judge all of Islam for the action of a few twisted fucks like Bin Laden and his followers!</b> They have a sick and skewed misinterperataion of thier own religion. <b>They represent a tiny radical faction of thier society, much like Neo-Nazis and the KKK here in the US.</b> Are all americans racist murderers, just because some morons, end up on the news, runing around buring crosses with bed sheets on their heads? No.<br>
<br>
As a final thought I want to say that I fully support my Americna friends and the possition of Pres. Bush. Once the right people have been found, the USA should act swiftly and forcefully to bring the guilty people (and those that are protecting them) to justice.<br>
<br>
<b>TERRORISM, AGAINST ANYONE, IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY--AN ACT OF WAR AGAINST HUMANITY!</b><br>

PS. In case you are wondering, no I am not muslim, nore am I from the middle east. I'm actually a white european catholic living in my adopted homeland, which I love very much.

<br>
If you want to be able to compare these three groups the neo-nazis and the KKK would have to be &quot;supported&quot; by the US government. Not as in officially giving them money/political support, but as in not doing anything to stop them and without saying approving of their actions. You would have to have quite a large part of americans throughout the world cheer and dance in the streets when they kill/torture a non kaukasian person. <br>
<br>
Do the US government approve of racists/nazis ? nope<br>
Do the Arab government approve of the terrorists trying to bring the great satan down ? Yes<br>
<br>

Quite recently (60s?), there was definately support for the KKK within the judical system, as evidenced by repeated acquittals of Klansmen in situations in which guilty verdicts would seem to have been much more appropriate.<br>
<br>
&gt; Do the Arab government approve of the terrorists trying to bring the great satan down ? <br>
<br>
The Iraqi government/media seem to approve of this act. Bin Laden claims not to have been behind the act, but to approve of it. But even the Taliban government in Afghanistan says they are shocked. Now, one may not believe this, and they are happy to harbour bin Laden, but I'm prepared to believe the horror expressed by many other Arabic nations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceruleanruneguard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CeruleanRuneguard</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/12/01 3:05:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick of ignorant people blaming Islam.</span><hr size=1> <br>
I don't blame Islam at all, in fact I hate that an entire group of people are lumped together because of their skin and/or beliefs.<br>
<br>
What I do blame are governments, religious sects, organizations, neighborhoods, and communities that support this type of activity.  Support comes in many varieties - sanctuary, financial, political, apathy, and feigned ignorance.<br>
<br>
The US has been the brunt of terrorism for nearly 20 years.  A short time compared to other nations.  But, as a whole we've remained complacent, turning a cheek, afraid of what our actions might cause.<br>
<br>
IMO the time has come to give an ultimatum to the nations that have a history of "harboring" terrorists.  An ultimatum with a swift and brutal consequence.<br>
<br>
I've often supported talks, and to a degree I support diplomatic efforts now.  But history has shown that diplomacy leads to short-term memory, scheming, scapegoating, and general lose of fervor.  This enemy has proven time-and-again that negotiations and compromise are not possible.<br>

<br>
&quot;Arab&quot; is an ethnic group which are mostly located in arabian peninsula and Iraq. Not all Arabs are Islamic (infact many are Jewish and Christian). Likewise not all Islamic peoples are Arab. The Turks are Islamic too, and are spread out between an area from Turkey, up into russia, and across the caucus mountains almost into China. During the Islamic conquests of 1100 - 1700AD, many people living in greece and the balkans were also converted to Islam, as were many Indians in that subcontinent. All over the middle east there are various smaller ethnic groups that are all Islamic. <br>
<br>
On top of it all, there are many different types of Islam. The two major types are Sunni in the west and Shi (which tend to be more militant) in the east. Both types abhor violence. <br>
<br>
Finally, not all &quot;arab&quot; and/or &quot;islamic&quot; people are ruled by one government. Most of these islamic governments do not support terrorism. Infact, Egypt itself an arabian islamic nation that is the regular target of many terrorist plots because it sides with western powers when it comes to many political oppinions. <br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, many people on this board post messages here thinking they know all the facts, when they don't. Others, usually the childish ones, simply don't care and just want to lash out at anyone. I also suspect that racism is a strong motivator for them to speak out against &quot;those dirty rag heads&quot; <br>

The group of ISLAMS that are responsible are Islamic Jihad. Now to put the Islamic Jihad into perpective they have there own complete different offsets of how one religion work. Almost like the difference between Catholics and Baptists in a far way albeit more extreme.<br>
<br>
     Islamic Jihad, instead of believing like the rest of islam ,they think the purging of infidels ( the US) is the main way to work there way to allah in the end. The rest of islam has a core set of beliefs none of which the Islamic Jihad represent. They share none of the same beliefs about the afterlife either. The only thing they agree on almost is Allah is there equivelent to god. So what am l rambling about? Well  basically just making the point the difference between Islamic Jihad and regular Muslims i the difference between The pope and louis Farrikhan. <p><a href="http://members.home.net/" target="_blank">

<br>
I do think Afganistan is harboring terrorists, and there for is just as guilty as the terrorists themselves. I think they are doing this out of their own free will, and if it is the case Bin Laden is responsible for these attacks, they should be attacked. <br>
<br>
But many of you seem to not know, or totally ignore a few important side facts, which can help us understand why they do the things they do. Internal politics is just as important there as it is here. <br>
<br>
It turns out that Bin Laden is a war hero there, and helped them win their independence from the USSR in the 1980s. Besides the fact that the Taliban feels honor bound to help Bin Laden when he asks for shelter, the fact that he is a &quot;Davy Crocket&quot; type character to the population there, helps the Taliban recruit more young men into their ranks for their ongoing war with the Northern Alliance (the Taliban's only real opponent in the current civil war there). If the Taliban pissed off Bin Laden, they risk loosing valueable new conscripts, but possibley control of the entire country if Bin Laden throws his support behind the Northern Alliance.<br>
<br>
 So in a lot of ways, you could say that they have no choice, but to shelter him, and risk getting attacked by the US every time he acts out. Sure, getting bombed isnt fun, but at least they stay in control, which ultimately is the only thing the leaders of any regime really care about.<br>
<br>
So you have to ask youself again, is Islam really evil, or is it Bin Laden and the Taliban?<br>

<br>
I do not have a problem with the islamic/arabic population, who just live their life and do not condone the terrorism. I do however have a problem with the governments who do not try to rid their area of known terrorists. When they say they think it is a tragedy what happened yesterday, and at the same time do not show with actions that they are trying to fix their terrorist problem is not ok. When the terrorists are celebrated as heroes it is nok ok!<br>

The same goes with any state that sponsors terrorism. Islamic or not, I could care less. Those who sponsor this shit are going to die, plain and simple.<br>

<br>
The Islamic Jihad is not an accepted and recongnizes sub-class of Islam, like Sunni or Shi. Those two branches are huge. <br>
<br>
And while its true that many of the smaller (and accepted/recongnized) branches started out the same way as the Islamic Jihad. They have grown to have quite large followings over 100s of years. One example is Twelver Shi'ism which believes in &quot;the hidden Madih.&quot; The Madih literally translated means &quot;one who will correct all wrongs&quot; Over the many centuries many power hungry and rebelious tribal leaders capitalized on this belief by claiming they were the Madih.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the point is that the group known as the Islamic Jihad, is very young. Only about 60 years old, if that. As it currently exists, I would classify it more as a &quot;secret society&quot; or a radical sect rather then an honest offshoot of Islam. <br>
<br>
A good analogy would be: <br>
<br>
if  Islam = Chistianity<br>
then Sunni = Catholisim <br>
and Islamic Jihad = Branch Dividian in Waco<br>
<br>
Thats how &quot;out there&quot; these guys are. David Koresh was having sex with multiple women and littke girls. Christianity doesnt teach that. Likewise, Islamic Jihad says to kill any american you can get your hands on... Islam doesnt teach that either. <br>

Maybe I am missunderstanding you, but you seem to be saying that any country that fit the arab/islamic combo automaticly harbors terrorists.<br>
<br>
I just gave you an example of an arab/islamic country, Egypt, that not only goes after terrorists, but is itself the victem of their attacks. Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the United Arab Emerits, Kuwait, are just to name a few arab/islamic countries that (while often dragging their feet) have a policy of going after terrorists. Iran, which has in the last 15 years become more and more moderate, has kicked out many known terrorists along with the hardliners in the government that were helping them. <br>
<br>
Infact, there are FEW arab/islamic countries that support terrorists. Lybia, Afganistan and Iraq to name the 3 biggest. <br>
<br>
And I absolutely agree with you, these governments are scum, and should be over thrown. Not only for the good of the countries who suffer from their terrorism, but also for the people who live there and who are being used. <br>

The USA was one of the last countries to disinvest from the Republic of South Africa and impose economic sanctions despite the openly-declared and legislated racism in that nation. Why? Because South Africa was a firm bastion of anti-communism and the US saw a partner to combat the *sarcasm on* stinking red pinko commies *sarcasm off*.<br>

Yes, I am aware that not all islamics are evil (I've got a lot of Islamic friends).  Yes I am aware of the actual definition of &quot;coward&quot; (like this fucking matters).  Yes I realize that &quot;violence begets more violence&quot;.  Yes I am aware that the Palestinians have some legit claims (so do the Israelis, a claim which the pro-Palestinians NEVER acknowledge).  Yes I am aware that not ALL of the 360 some thousand Palestinians were celebrating (just a healthy representative sample).<br>
<br>
But you know what? Right now I am pissed off and I really don't care.  We are pissed off, hurt and angry.  Anyone who wouldn't be is an emotional zombie.<br>

<br>
While I am heavily biased on this issue, it is VERY wrong to stereotype moslems as being fundamentalist.   Ben Laden does represent a small percentage of moslems, including the Hamas in Israel/Palestine, the fundamentalist faction fighting in Egypt, the Islamic Jihad in the PA area, Hezbollah in Lebanon.<br>
<br>
Many of the most violent anti-western regimes are in fact secular-based, including Iraq and Syria.<br>
<br>
The real issue is with the terrorists and the countries who support terrorism, either overtly or covertly.  They include Syria (Islamic Jihad), Iran (Hezbollah), Libya and Iraq (multiple groups).<br>
<br>
Turkey is an example of an overwhelming moslem country that is VERY anti-fundamentalist, and an ally of Israel militarily. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=44.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessageRange?topicID=44.topic&start=41&stop=58>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showPrevMessage?topicID=44.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showNextMessage?topicID=44.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=44.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=44.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=44.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=44.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
