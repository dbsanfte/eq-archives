<br>
Silac say's,<br>
Never really felt like replying to this thread untill I seen some things get misunderstood. This has nothing to do with &quot;cyber&quot;. What it does have to do with is the fact that Zolmaz - on one of his drunken rants in /gu the other night insulted someone (that druid chick you are hearing so much about) and I decided to give him a piece of my mind about it. None of you outside of Magister have the faintest clue what this is about and just because Zolmaz mumbles something (because hes pissed off about something 90% of the time)about it being a girl you jump to conclusions. Whether it was a dude or a woman I would have done the same thing. So...give the cyber bit a rest please. Thanks...<br>
Silac.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First off you little Pussy boy, I wasn't pissed off untill<br>
Koryo deguilded me. To jog your memory All I said was<br>
FRITTI has me on her ignore list. Then you went and<br>
opened your Ignorant mouth without knowing any facts<br>
and or asking why. And I did not insult her. I only said<br>
she had me on her ignore list, <br>
And would not port me to our guild functions any longer. <br>
Then you THOUGHT you had to protect her name. HAH.<br>
<br>
Fritti may have fucked her way into the guild but<br>
once in, she decided to stop porting me. then<br>
ignoring me completely when asked for a port to a <br>
Guild Raid. IMO thats all a druid is good for.<br>
Ramien being the exception in my book.<br>
<br>
When she ask's in Guildchat &quot;who needs a port ? And <br>
I answer yes I do. then never get that port. I have <br>
just wasted 30 min or more of my time waiting for<br>
a port that she decided would never happen.<br>
<br>
Fritti has only been in the guild for less then 2 weeks<br>
when she started this crap. Is that Bullshit ? yes.<br>
What that tells me is that she &quot;Like a typical little<br>
bitch&quot;, Fucked her way into the guild then proceded<br>
to act like the bitch that she was.<br>
<br>
Had I known she would stop playing the game as<br>
intended I would have stamped a Big Fat FUCK-NO<br>
on her Forehead !, Oh wait, I forgot, We cant vote<br>
no on worthless bitches without Pissing off Silac.<br>
<br>
Now, On to you Silac,<br>
You say I am pissed off 90% of the time i play ?<br>
Now that statement alone proves your head<br>
is full of blackened-Bullshit. In fact Your allways the little<br>
Pussy-boy throwing your little hissy fit whenever we <br>
ever got wiped out, and cussing up a storm in Guildchat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Silac, You are the only one to ever piss me off in the <br>
game. <br>
<br>
And I will tell everyone why Since I was banned from<br>
the guild board Over this stuck up Druid called Fritti I am<br>
forced to air your dirty laundry to the Emarr world.<br>
<br>
You silac have a Big flappy mouth like 98 year old pussy.<br>
Paints a nice picture don't it ? Well its true.<br>
<br>
You open your mouth to people outside the guild telling<br>
them Everything that is posted on our Guildboard<br>
and what is being said about that person in Guildchat,<br>
<br>
And I am not just talking about anyone, I am talking<br>
about these little cyber bitches you want to get into <br>
the guild so you can try and prove how Powerfull<br>
you think you are, In your pethetic life as a looser.<br>
<br>
You violated guild rules in doing so and THAT pisses me<br>
off. And whats really annoying is that Koryo was to <br>
Cowardly to do anything about it and Avoided the<br>
facts, And even your admiting to passing on this<br>
knowledge. What a load of fucking crap.<br>
<br>
Btw what I posted was not even close to a drunken rant.<br>
I was just saying, FUCK YOU. I didn't whine <br>
like a Pussy-Boy or point fingers. in fact had you kept<br>
your stupid little mouth shut, This would have never been<br>
posted. Or the first &quot;Fuck you&quot; post.<br>
<br>
It seems magister is turning into a guild of Loot sluts.<br>
The closeness that we used to have in the day's of<br>
Da'Kor are all but lost. People will do anything<br>
to join. There are the old timers, then there are the<br>
newcomers. with a gray line between. And hardly<br>
any communication between the 2.<br>
<br>
WHEN the opinion of a guildmate is overlooked and<br>
more importance is given to an invite that is unknown<br>
to many, When there is a problem in the structure,<br>
Then that structure &quot;like home&quot; will begin to errode and fall apart. <br>
As will the voting system. In fact it already <br>
has. <br>
<br>
Some people just don't want to post what<br>
they think about someone because they don't want<br>
to put up with Anyone's Bullshit. like Silac's Bullshit.<br>
<br>
TRUST is no longer in a guild&quot; when A Person is <br>
Deguilded or Frowned on for giving His/Her opinion<br>
about an Invite/sponsor Or a problem with another<br>
person in the guild.<br>
<br>
Not having the ability to speak your mind in important<br>
matters, &quot;Well&quot; thats a Big problem. <br>
And that is something that WAS very important to Myself <br>
and others in the guild. don't kid yourself. Its <br>
true, And You silac, Are most of the problem.<br>
<br>
Bottom line,<br>
I don't like being fucked with, Koryo, I am very disapointed <br>
in you for causing all this shit. In fact,<br>
I had no idea you were the Supreme leader of the guild.<br>
Imagine all this time I had no idea you thought you were<br>
the GOD to the guild, and could Deguild anyone you<br>
wanted on a whim, instead of handling this in a professional manor, <br>
You took the cowardly way out.<br>
<br>
If you believe that druid is more important then long time<br>
members of the guild, You are on the wrong road.<br>
<br>
<br>
Btw, I suggest that silac keep his ass off this thread<br>
or I may just reopen my account and cause all of you<br>
a great deal of fucking pain and headache.<br>
<br>
<br>
OH,, And another big FUCK YOU to silac.<br>

Why on earth would Fritti possibly put such a sweetheart like you on ignore?<br>
<br>
I mean, why wouldn't she want to talk to a guy that describes her as a &quot;typical little bitch&quot; and refers to women as &quot;worthless bitches?&quot;<br>
<br>
So, tell us...<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> why would Fritti put you on her ignore list?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I was guilded with Fritti for about a year, I think your characterization of her is pretty darned funny.  Stuck up? Hardly. She was a great member of Affliction, always willing to help out and selfless in the extreme.  Maybe it's because I never insulted her her gender or class, but she was always very generous with her playtime in providing rides.<br>
<br>
While I can't argue with you that Silac can be short tempered in game, I doubt you made him angry because he was having some kind of affair with Fritti (I don't know and I don't care!) I hope he was angry with you because Fritti is a person, a good person who didn't need to be subjected to your insults and degredation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you believe that druid is more important then long time members of the guild, You are on the wrong road.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmmm, on one hand we have Fritti.  Sweet, helpful, generous with her time (and funny!).  On the other hand we have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, hateful, belligerent, probably making every female in the guild uncomfortable.  I think Magister made the exact right decision.<br>
<br>
A lot of guilds in EQ seem to suffer from a &quot;locker room&quot; mentality.  A majority of male players, many of them young, leads to a lot of rampant testosterone.  I'm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> proud</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of Magister for booting your rabid little ass out of their guild and not allowing you hate spewing, foul mouthed, anti-woman smack talk.<br>
<br>
I've read your posts on this board.  I have no clue of your actual age, but you sound like a misogynstic teenager who can't achieve a relationship with a female in real life.  Your anger and hatred against women is so palpable, I suggest you seek counseling. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unogem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nogem</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 161<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/25/01 9:55:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silac, You just had to open your F-Mouth again.</span><hr size=1> /cheer Zolmaz<br>

And I think Glori probably read that one Zol, still doesnt change the fact that your rantings are much the same as in that thread only its now directed at Fritti and the person who defended her. You probably freaked out on Fritti with one of your I hate women rants and you wonder why she has you on ignore. Nothing personal Zol, but try AA, might help a little.  <p><center><img src="http://members.home.net/fitzpatr/Anasig5.gif"></a></center>

I wonder how many others will come here to refute Zolmaz that have no actual knowledge of the events in question.   All it will do is keep a thread alive that would otherwise fade into obscurity.  Sounds like a great way to stand up for a friend, keeping their names in the spot light in such a negative manner.<br>
