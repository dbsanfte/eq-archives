<br>
This is also for first time dragon raiders...<br>
<br>
Naggy, for Nagafen I suggest a minimum level of 48, anything under isn't much help and will just widen your chances of getting loot.  Everyone should have at LEAST 60 or 70 fr / mr, I know we all aren't rich, but anyone who can go on a dragon raid can surely camp a froglok crown 20fr / 20cr and a 20 cr cloak in everfrost.  There are lots of ways to get resist gear, and if I had it my way no one under 60 / 70 would be allowed to come.<br>
<br>
Second, when a dragon raid is planned for a certain time, be there at that time, if you cannot make it at that time, let someone responsible now about it and camp in the gathering spot before hand...<br>
<br>
Find your own port to the gathering spot, as much as you think druids and wizzards are your personal port buddy, they aren't, give them a break throw up 15pp for your own port.<br>
<br>
When you get to the gathering place take anon / roleplay off and turn lfg on by typing /lfg on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Join the raid channel and be patient, don't ask questions in the channel unless they are important.  Don't ask what time the raid will start, you should already know.  As a personal raid leader, I get bombarded with useless tells from people that they could answer themselves if they read the message board.  Just sit at the gathering place and wait for the raid leader to announce the following directions.<br>
<br>
The raid leader will more than likely make the groups now, don't ask to be in &quot;cool d00d's name&quot; group, don't ask to be the main tank or main healer, the raid leader will assign you your spot.  <br>
<br>
When you head in to the dragon zone ( sol b / perma ) wait at zone in and wait until the leader tells you where to go, follow the instructions and follow the raiders, don't go afk during this, and make someone come back and get you, that is annoying. <br>
<br>
When you start clearing the giants, WAIT FOR THE ASSIST TO BE CALLED, leaders hate when you jump the gun, and stay back, nothing urks a leader more than someone aggroing a giant because they couldn't stay back.<br>
<br>
When the assist is called, hit your assist key and kill the giant (wow that's hard<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  If the giant drops loot, don't ask for it, the leader will ask who is in, just be patient.<br>
<br>
While the giants are being cleared don't ask the raid about killing the dragon and what to do, it will be explained to you, just be patient.<br>
<br>
When you get to the buff hall, CASTERS BIND, just do it, don't ask &quot;sir, im bound in really_hard_place_to_get_to_03&quot;, just bind yourself there.<br>
<br>
Don't ask the raid who should buff who and what not, the leader will tell you, follow directions and be patient if your not the first person with buffs, it is also polite to thank your fellow buffers for doing a good job.<br>
<br>
When the strats are being gone over listen patiently, and wait till after all strats are done to ask your questions, these are the strats i used on my vox and naggy attempts...<br>
<br>
Naggy - <br>
<br>
Have the Main Assist charge and get sufficient taunt, I usually gave the main tank 3 or 4 healers if i had enough to make sure he wouldn't die, spam heal him, don't worry about running OOM, if u run from FM to OOM on a nagafen attempt, don't go because that shouldn't happen even if you were a lvl 35 / 40.<br>
<br>
Chanters tash him as soon as you can<br>
<br>
Shamans slow him as soon as tash is landed, this is pretty important...<br>
<br>
Casters nuke at 60 or whenever nuke is called.<br>
<br>
Once he is dead get off his corpse and let the raid leader loot, don't complain about loot, it's not like the raid leader made it so he'd have bad loot, don't go if you don't like the loot rules either.<br>
<br>
Give the leader 15pp for dot costs and thank him / her for leading a naggy raid, they don't get paid to do it.<br>
<br>
Vox- <br>
I usually give the MA 3 to 4 healers again, <br>
<br>
It is basically the same strategy as Nagafen, except have everyone mem a stun spell, yes you cannot stun vox, but it WILL interrupt her casting which is what you want, if you have all classes chain cast stun spells once she is at 40, there is almost no way she'll land a CH.  <br>
<br>
Do anything you can to stun her, that is the most important thing to fighting vox, don't let her ch...<br>
<br>
Have everyone cast only stun spells once she is at 40 until she is dead.<br>
<br>
Once vox is dead back up the corpse and don't complain about loot.<br>
<br>
These are the basics of the dragon raids. I'm sure i had typo's and left out information, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
Every first time dragon raider should read this, it will give the raid leader a LOT less headaches, and I don't think it would be a bad idea to sticky this to the dragons and planes board either<br>
<br>
Thanks, and good luck with your dragons<br>

<br>
Also helps to read ToV guides to get more ideas. Zergling always makes me laugh. People actually believe vox and naggy are the only mobs in the game like this, they are just mobs. Naggy can be done with 2 groups pretty easily if your well equipt and know what to do. <br>
<br>
only thing you left out is steal as much of voxs mana as you can (ench and sometimes bards) the ENTIRE fight.. not just when she starts to gate. Some mobs regen mana faster now as well, so I would not do vox with less then 2 level 52 (less resists) enchies MIN, If your really good you can try push / FLIP tactics, but on these, please don't be insulted, newb dragon raids, your lucky if your MA can pull the dragon to the center before calling assist.<br>
<br>
Dragon record as leader...<br>

Let the 2 banished dragons pay for their treason...Over and over. If they had not gone against the elders the sleeper would not have been created. They have brought ruin to many lands. A red and a white dragon...mateing.../sigh<br>
