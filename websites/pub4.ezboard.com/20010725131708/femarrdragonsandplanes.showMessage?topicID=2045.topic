It is possible my memory fails me.<br>
<br>
No Kanya I used to know your real name as well<br>
and I enjoyed playing EQ with you and Raand.<br>
<br>
But I am by your standards an old man now and I come from an era where it was very very bad form to form close freindships with other men's girlfreinds. It was <br>
considered a courtesy to the other male to NOT do that.<br>
This didnt mean I felt you were an extention of Raand<br>
by any means. In fact you chatted far more that<br>
Raand.<br>
<br>
I didnt/wasnt able to tell when it was you or Raand or<br>
his dad playing a specific character. <br>
<br>
No it was fun back then, in fact I hate to say this but<br>
the most fun memories I have in EQ about desperate fights in long dark corridors or suddenly being overun<br>
by mobs, were with Tizzird and Teuvas and Me just<br>
the three of us, taken by surprise in Lguk and managing<br>
somehow to survive. Waiting for Remdar to log in.<br>
<br>
It is sad how things went.<br>
<br>
After I returned to EM I didnt know who's twink was whos and I still dont. So I didnt know you played Kanya.<br>
I didnt know Raand was someone else.<br>
<br>
I think that is the first time Raand and I have agreed on<br>
any subject in almost two years.<br>
<br>
It truely was a different game them. I am glad I wasnt here during the period of time where only Vox and<br>
Naggy were the top mobs. I suspect things became very heated and arguments many.<br>

it was beba, chiteng.<br>
<br>
all of that was a long time ago.  at that time, i was very used to being viewed as nothing more than &quot;rand's gf&quot;, no one knew me, i didn't expect much.<br>
<br>
two of my closest friends turned out to be the two you hated most.  tzzird became very much a rolemodel for me in some ways.  i learned a lot from him.<br>
<br>
and kuzic, well, kuzic is one of the people i'm still in contact with from eq days and i bug him to this day, everyday.  hehe.<br>
<br>
i read what you posted in that thread, and kinda laughed remembering the flamefests you used to get into with these people, my friends.  and then i read thal's post and knew he had no idea what you were talking about or even referring to.  it seemed ironic to me that he was defending something that had nothing to do with him, as it was before he even had an application into dakor..or even before dakor existed.  <br>
<br>
of course, i have memories of everquest that predate my time within the game.  i didn't even have a character in the game when i witnessed the first fear raids, the first naggy raids, the fights between remdar and rand over one or the other pissing each other off.  kinda crazy when i think of it now.  i felt like i knew all those people even though none of them even knew i existed.  talk about a strange introducion to a dynamic new world.<br>

<br>
However, that had nothing to do with what Chit posted.  <br>
<br>
Raand was totaly correct in the other thread, sure some raids went smoother than others and lots of times it had to do with who was/wasn't present.  <br>
<br>
However, the tone of the entire guild didn't change based on who was online.  We didn't, suddenly as a whole become &quot;nicer&quot;.  I'm not saying that individuals didn't say something that perhaps wouldn't have been said if they weren't at the raid, however the guild as a whole didn't act in a different fashion.  My problem with Chit is that he lumps everyone together because he doesn't like a few people.  Just say what you mean and stop generalizing Da`kor.  <br>
<br>
Then again, this is all just opinion, and I can't say I'm not biased.<br>

<br>
You will NEVER find any post on any forum where I have EVER accused Tzzird of exploiting (or Teuvas)<br>
<br>
Yes I know they both think that I have and I am sure they will show up and flame me here. BUT that changes<br>
NOTHING. They think I have and they react as if I have.<br>
I am unable to correct that. They are uninterested in<br>
what I may have actually said. All that concerns them<br>
is perception. After a long time perception become what<br>
they consider reality. That wont matter to me fortunately, the people who I HAVE accused of cheating and exploiting know exactly who they are. Most of them<br>
have never denied it. Most of them have never replied.<br>
Most of the TRUELY jaded members of DaKor who knew the REAL issues (like Oynyn(sp?) and Leiran) conceeded<br>
the point and stated that they simply didnt care if the<br>
person they were grouping with was a notorious exploiter/cheater.<br>
To me that is answer enough.<br>
<br>
But there IS one player who lied to my face when I asked<br>
him about it. And I believed him. Thus when the evidence<br>
became overwhelming I must say I lost my temper.<br>
To my knowledge he is no longer on the server. I dont recall if he was ever in DaKor. I dont think he was, I really cant say.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tzzird and Teuvas can be very fun people indeed BUT<br>
it always has to be on THEIR terms. They tend to get<br>
upset when things are NOT on their terms. They tend to<br>
NOT listen and jump to conclusions based on faulty perceptions.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is like this:<br>
<br>
Have any of you EVER heard me flame Ogmuk or Naru?<br>
No you have not.<br>
Do you think that is because I agree with him/them?<br>
Dont hold your breath.<br>
<br>
I dont flame him because he hasnt offended my sensibilities. Yes he has defended his guild when he felt<br>
I attacked it. It is possible I would do the same.<br>
<br>
The one thing I am absolutely<br>
certain of is that Ogmuk hates cheaters and exploiters<br>
as much as I do. (or at least he did)<br>
<br>
Ogmuk has a trait that I very much wish I had.<br>
He has the ability to bend.<br>
He has the ability to NOT become absolute.<br>
These are enviable abilities both in game and in reality.<br>
<br>
But all this is about a guild that no longer exists.<br>
I see no point in rehashing.<br>
Magister is not DaKor. Let them be evaluated<br>
on their DEEDS.<br>
<br>
I certainly do not feel I need to reply to people<br>
that dont have even the slightest idea of what the real<br>
issues were. Even more I dont feel the need to reply<br>
to the people who claim they are retired.<br>
<br>
 If you dont like my posts, no one forces<br>
you to read them. Why not do yourself a favor and not<br>
read them.<br>

As for exploiting, who gives a shit? Look at the time frame you’re talked about. Pre-expansion when so and so was level 30something wielding l33t Combined long swords.

<br>
There are different types of exploitation, just as there are varying degrees of crimes committed everyday. Each one has its own degree of severity and each one should be taken on an individual case basis, in my opinion. Stealing a $0.05 piece of gum from the candy store isn’t the same as detonating a truck full of explosives outside a Federal building, I think we can all agree on that.<br>
<br>
If you are off in some zone, where a /who reveals no one but yourself, I could really care less what you do and no, it doesn’t effect anyone else. Even with the most efficient exploits I’ve heard about, people were only able to level slightly faster than if they had done it legitimately. People used to DOT/Nuke specs and get them stuck in the cave, they were still expending mana and they still had downtime.<br>
<br>
The only time I tend to have issues with exploitation is if someone would find a way to reduce a 30-person encounter to a solo one, which would be a bit obscene. I guess I also have issues with people who exploit, blatantly, amidst other groups of people. If there is a group killing X mob and some solo guy comes along and starts taking their pulls, and exploiting them, he/she deserves a drop kick to the cranium. Everyone knows exploitation is wrong, at least they should be smart enough to do it when no one is around.<br>
<br>
Exploitation is a personal choice, I'm not for or against it as a whole. When my Necro was level 8 Verant made an error and bugged the Darkness line of spells, to the player’s advantage. Once cast, they never wore off and this was when you could just run and kite something all day as the DOT’s did damage. Was it my fault the spell was broken, no. Should I have not used the spell, fuck that. They made the error, it was a spell I used on a regular basis and, thanks to them, I gained 8 levels in a day. I guess its Karma that Necros are now mana-pumping damage parsers in the high-end game… <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
You seem to be saying that exploiting is ok as long as no-one sees it and because its the game designers own fault for not having a bug free game.  Also that no-one gets hurt by it as it does not affect other players.<br>
<br>
Well i asked for your opinion and you were good enough to give it, after all we are all entitled to one.<br>
<br>
For me i'd say that people who exploit have a major effect on others.<br>
<br>
They level faster and often with a much reduced risk than other players, this means they then have access to other areas (higher) than other people.  They then use their exploits to farm these areas for items they should not have (if they had not exploited) and finally they go on to monopolise areas/mobs over other people who, because they played honestly, dont have the power to compete.  <br>
<br>
Thats my opinion on it, consider that most CS people (in any game) will ban you for exploiting because 'it is against the rules'.<br>
<br>
I'll use a good example for you Ven.  We were both at the Efreet last night and you were pulling some mobs from the bottom of the ramp.  Now lets say i have some kind of FD exploit whereby if i damage a mob then it always returns to me and my group always gets the xp, even when you pull it, the mob runs to where i am, no matter how much damage you do, the mob gives its Xp to me because of a messed up aggro bug.<br>
<br>
So i sit in the efreet monopolising all the spawns and you cannot get any xp.<br>
<br>
From your reply i assume you would consider that an ok thing for me to do as i am merely takign advantage of a bug that the propgrammers were not smart enough to fix, and i would still have to kill the mob (as in your example with the spectres).  <br>
<br>
Now i know you said that if someone takes your xp then that would (in your opinion) be wrong, so you might say that you dont agree with the above example anyway. (and yes i am 2nd guessing you here, stick with me).<br>
<br>
Now lets use the above example again only this time you are not there and i have 5 other people with me who are not grouped (with me).  I go and pull a mob and do 1 damage to it, the other 5 people then proceed to kill it really fast and i get solo xp, rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
This second example would, from your reply, not be hurting anyone and would be 'ok' (in your opinion).  Using it a person could get from 50-60 in a matter of days and then be in a position to go places that other people could not, attain things that others who had worked hard for, could not get.<br>
<br>
Do you still think that as long as no-one is around and you are not directly KS'ing, that exploiting is ok Ven?<br>
<br>
Have a think about it, like you i am just giving my opinion.<br>

<font color=fff00>They level faster and often with a much reduced risk than other players, this means they then have access to other areas (higher) than other people.</font><br>
<br>
I didn’t make it quite clear, but I'm speaking strictly from an Everquest point of view. So they level faster with much reduced risk, and? Oh, then they have access to other high-level areas… where they can get their asses beat since you cant solo. Lets say we all jump to a new server, start fresh. I choose to exploit and get to level 50 in half the time as anyone else, then what do I do? Not many classes are capable of efficiently exploiting, almost none can solo in any of the high level zones that yield above average gear. So, I can’t obtain anything you can’t. I’ve actually lost out by not making friends along the way. A group of 35-40’s will be able to do more than I would solo at 50.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>We were both at the Efreet last night and you were pulling some mobs from the bottom of the ramp.</font><br>

Actually, I was pulling everything… muahaha!<br>

<br>
Much like every other character, I didn’t choose “Tree” as my class. I am free to get off my ass and move to somewhere else, the joy of mobility. You are also talking extreme exploits that entire classes would have access to, anywhere. They would be fixed, emergency patch style, before you gained 2 blue-pixels.<br>

<br>
Can you try, at least for a minute, to maintain a coherent train of thought? You're KS’ing 5 people, which I said pretty clearly I had issues with(I can re-quote myself if you need to see it in a pretty color?), and then asking what I think about it when people aren’t around… what happened to those 5 people? If you're going to go through the trouble of thinking up an elaborate example, at least have the question you ask me about it make sense. This is apples and oranges shit. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
Vendrix who cannot make a post without using profanity.<br>
<br>
No Vendrix there is one other thing that such people who exploited back then did. <br>
<br>
First let me clarify one issue, I saw one player<br>
level from 34 to 50 in two weeks. This player<br>
as far as I know was first to 50 in his class.<br>
<br>
Back then there were no other players that high<br>
except Shinjo. So he was all alone at the front.<br>
<br>
Now perhaps YOU think that gaining 16 levels in 14 days<br>
is no big deal, but I do.<br>
<br>
Since he was a popular class he was in BIG demand<br>
for groups. Alot of items entered the game that would<br>
never have been available for a LONG time had he not<br>
been with the groups. Alot of people ALOT benifited<br>
because he was able to save them major xp thru high<br>
level rezz. Alot of people even freinds of yours benifited<br>
DIRECTLY from association with this guy and they KNEW<br>
how he gained those levels, but they didnt care.<br>
They DID however care that I refused to shut up about it.<br>
<br>
Not unlike what your doing now. So your saying that<br>
a person can cheat and as long as YOU didnt cheat<br>
he can hand you a high level item in a low level game<br>
and there is nothing wrong with doing that.<br>
<br>
That is very illuminating Vendrix thank you.<br>
<br>
(btw Vendrix himself did NOT benifit from this player<br>
I know becuase I knew the character Vendrix played.<br>
So this isnt a blast of Vendrix - except for his <br>
unfortunate inability to express himself without being<br>
profane) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1689<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/20/01 9:11:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> no need to flame me Ven, i just wanted some honest flame free intelligent dialogue on the subject and thought you could provide it.<br>

<br>
i think the time frame chiteng vented about exploiting compared to the time frame that mitch is now shaing her opinion on it are two very big factors in the debate.<br>
<br>
when chiteng became adament against the use of bugs and exploits, the items and benefits of playing with the exploiter were MUCH larger than they are now.  back then you couldn't walk into ec and get just about any high end item you wanted by trading a bunch of lesser items for it, or buying it straight out with plat.  (no, this isn't a knock on mitch, it's a fact).  back then, you really could cheat others out of their &quot;gaming experience&quot; (according to chiteng), whereas now, the game is sort of a big joke and exploiting to high levels is the same as being powerleveled to high levels.  now, i believe that it is possible to see that the comparison does lend some interesting thought to the situation.  i tend to think that others exploiting and such does not affect my game play if i'm not a member of their party, but i CAN see how others would feel that it did, especially back in the days when the benefit of having that lvl 50 cleric helping a bunch of lvl 30 people could cause them to see places and toys that others would never see until much much later.  i can understand that, not sure if i agree with it, but i see it.<br>
<br>
for the record, the cleric he is talking about is the original remdar, i'm pretty positive of that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   now rem leveled up to fifty (regardless of how) and then proceeded to play the game.  i often wondered if he (and shinjo for that matter) ever got lonely up there at the top.  being the first to fifty was much different than being the first to sixty in terms of other people out there still being able to play with you.  but i do remember this.  a full group of us went to kill a particular creature in the karanas, we, being lower lvl, pull a bunch of stuff with it.  remdar comes in solo and takes the creature we needed, and kills it all by himself.  after he kills it, he comes up and apologizes for the ks, but he has been camping it for a long time.  we leave, no big deal (keep in mind, this is when rand hated remdar anyway).  this was one of those times when chiteng would be in the right, the guy who &quot;exploited&quot; his way to the top made a difference in our game playability in the simple fact that our full group could not keep up in damage with his single cleric spells and lvl gap.  <br>
<br>
now view this situation:  remdar and tzzird are killing that troll chick in innothule, you know, the one for the ruby quest thing?  well, some guy comes up and asks them if they can not kill him because he wants to do the quest.  about this time, rand and parnell see rem and tzz beating the snot out of this troll and walk up and start beating on it too.  just to be assholes really.  rem and tzz zone so the guy can do his quest and parn and rand finish off the troll and walk off leaving the poor guy sitting there with no troll for his quest.  remdar immediately finds parn and rand sitting outside of guk and starts blazing into them for their lack of courtesy and blatant disregard for other people's game.  <br>
<br>
kind of interesting, no?<br>
<br>
so anyway, that was a really wordy and elaborate way of saying that it doesnt' matter how you level, really.  what you do in the game will affect other players regardless, and all of them are shady play styles.  doesn't mean the player is a bad person, just means they did something short sighted or rude.<br>
<br>
mitchy, i want you to think about something else too.  how many times have you had to come back and justify your trading practices (over the last how many months...over a year, i'm sure) because people would say you didn't deserve the high end gear you ended up with because you didn't &quot;earn&quot; it in the same sense that they did?  i know they are two different things, but the point is that you will not, just as they could not, show them how they are in the wrong.  there are always justifications and blind sides.  <br>
<br>
and let's not forget kiddies, feign dead pulling is an exploit.   (i equate that with vendrix's 0.05 cent piecie of gum)<br>

<br>
Is exploiting wrong?  Certainly, I would agree with that.<br>
<br>
Does Chiteng go way overboard for an offense that doesn't necessitate that much animosity?  Does he put way too much time and effort thinking about these things?  Does he need to realize that the people who did exploit weren't doing such with some sort of malicious intent?  <br>
<br>
Personally I always felt bad for the people who exploited.  To me, they were missing what was truly enjoyable about the game.  I never saw a need to get upset with them.  If I felt like exploiting to get xp faster I could do so.  If my morals dictated that I would rather not do that, then I would be happy with myself for acting in a manner I admire.  <br>
<br>
Where exactly does animosity enter into the equation?<br>
<br>
It’s akin to a little child seeing another kid doing something that his mother won’t let him do so he starts kicking his arms and legs about screaming, “mommy that’s not fair!  That’s not fair!”<br>
<br>
At which point the mother turns around and says “STFU, who said life was fair?”  <br>
