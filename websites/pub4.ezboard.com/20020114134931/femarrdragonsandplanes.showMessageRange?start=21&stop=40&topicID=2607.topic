PoG, not dragon.  And no one has every had a hissy fit over any loot rules that have been on our raids.  The PoG threads you were referring to were over someone purposely ganking a raid .. history now, but thanks for bringing it up in a place where it has zero to do with anything.<br>

Oh boy, she's playing the martyr.  I'll give you a refresher course here .. Sagemon is a rather respected person in the EQ community, and one of the best raid leaders you'll ever see.  However, if his comments had no effect on you, you wouldn't be here rattling your cage, would you?<br>

</font><br>
<br>
There is no way to determine what will drop, there is no way to determine if the casters can roll on anything PERIOD.  So why alter the rules around and make it more difficult than it needs to be.  As far as the wis casters not rolling on the scale they get to roll on the res stick/cleric hammer IF IT DROPS just like the int casters get to roll on the scale IF IT DROPS... the last raids I attended NONE of the above dropped... not the scale, not the patch, not the hammer, not the res stick... the melee classes made off with RBB's, bracers, bags, spears... but NOTHING for the casters.  What was I supposed to do let the druids roll on the RBB?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Sagemon is a rather respected person in the EQ community</font><br>
<br>
So are about 1500 other people... <br>
<br>
And as far as how well "respected" Sagemon is, he's no better than any other player I walk past when running through any other zone, I dont give a shit how well he can run a plane raid... I dont know him, frankly I dont care to, and I could care less how much any of you like me.<br>
<br>
Im not impressed... Im glad that you are.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>You've satisfied yourself apparently, and that's the only view you care to see.</font><br>
<br>
IF that was the case... IF... it was dont you think I'd be letting wis casters (such as myself) roll on the scale for the cloak???? <br>
<br>
I (personally) dont think casters PERIOD should roll on the scale (for the raids that I lead atleast) but I did post that I'd be letting int casters roll on it during my next raid...  so once again you're wrong.<br>
<br>
I (personally) think that since you can BUY a cloak and you cannot BUY an epic weapon that the casters should not be allowed to roll... but YES I DID try to satisfy others... has nothing to do with MY PERSONAL opinions, wishes, or thoughts.  But you give me ONE solution of how to random the loot that will please everyone and I'll go climb under a rock.<br>
<br>
So... keep going... I dont mind, you're not going to make me cry, you're not going to make me apologize... you can say and do as you wish, everyone (you and me and every other person who comes here) has a right to voice an opinion...<br>
<br>
Im just glad you're so "GODLIKE" that you are all so much better than the little people like me...<br>

Oh yea...when did dragons stop being the end game anyways?  <br>
<br>
Negafen / Vox - Original <br>
VP - Kunark<br>
NToV - Vellious<br>
<br>
Hmm...all dragons there.  So umm if you've been playing long enough to remember when dragons were the end game does that give us a time frame...no.  Pointless statement.  Of course you probably meant when Vox / Negafen specifically was the end game.  But &lt;shrug&gt; you didn't specify.<br>
<br>
Possible to put Fear / Hate / Sky after they came out as the end game over Vox / Nags.  Greater difficulty but loot about the same for the mobs really.  Considering no one was able to make it very far in Sky pre RoK guess it is above.  Ok, dragons weren't the end game for a small space of time.<br>

<br>
I made a decision a long time ago that Sagemon, Tormentcia and Vetinari will be the only people that I will raid with.  That's a personal choice, but they're friends of mine and I trust them implicitly.  I made the mistake of joining someone else's Fear DISASTER, and will never do it again.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Even if I'm confusing the threads, are you going to deny that you ran PoG raids and set the raid rules?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
To my knowledge, no one has denied setting their own raid rules.  I was under the impression that that's a given.  I'm not singling you out, Caoilfhionn, just making sure this is clear.<br>
<br>
I can tell you that the loot rules are the same on EVERY SINGLE RAID we go on, regardless of where it is.  The only exception would be epic mobs, but then that's pretty self-explanatory too, isn't it?  <br>
<br>
I think it's also a given that it's your raid, your rules.  I think the question here is, why can't everyone ABLE to use the item be given a chance to roll?  My base wisdom is also 85.  I'm wearing a Cloak of the Ice Bear on my back. Why wouldn't I be able to roll on a cloak that would give my wisdom a boost of 9 points?  Sure, I can see where it would help the bards tremendously.  But it's also something that would help me.  How do you decide who needs it more?<br>
<br>
Personally, I couldn't care less about it.  But I'm trying to make a point, which is all I think that Vetinari was trying to do.  I'm amazed that people can take things that others say and make a question look like an insult.  Just amazing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, have fun on your raids!  I hope everyone gets what they want! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umorphiusthejeweller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorphiusTheJeweller</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/31/01 7:00:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> NBG is dumb !!</span><hr size=1> IMO,<br>
<br>
All droppable loot should be randomed to all.<br>
<br>
Giving a white scale to a 50-52 bard is dumb.  Most bards of this level are no position to finish the Bard epic quest, so the scale will just sit in the bank.  Let's do a roll call of 55+ bards that haven't completed the quest yet.<br>
<br>
Making the white scale into a cloak is SUPER dumb.  Sell the white scale to a 55+ bard.  There are many that are more than willing to buy them, as this is the only thing they have left to finish epic.  Use the money to buy a Heiro cloak, and have money left over to buy a bunch of other gear.<br>
<br>
I see WAY too many RBB's and CoF's for sale in game and on these boards to condone giving one to a tank so they can sell and make a ton of PP.<br>
<br>
If I was to run a pick-up dragon raid, all droppable loot obtained would be randomed to all.  If you don't like the rules, don't come.  If you are a caster, and win the scale, give it to a bard you know if you wish.  The pally book will default to the highest level pally that contacts me before the raid.  This will probably be a 55+ pally, since most of them don't have their epics.  Giving the book to a 50 pally so it can sit in bank for 6 months is DUMB.<br>
<br>
Open random is the only FAIR way to do loot in this game.  NBG is DUMB !!<br>

However, this isnt going to stop me from doing more Vox raids, it isnt going to stop me from doing loot how I see fit.<br>
<br>
I have also posted to friends and fellow raiders I dont even know that well that if they needed a raid run for their guild, or for them for a certain item that I would be willing to help them out if planned ahead of time.  Fuck me if Im wrong but Im seeing myself as being a very giving and considerate person in this whole matter... Im not asking for everyone to say "oh holy Jex your loot plan is perfect" because it never will be (to every person) ... but I moved the argument here rather than ignoring it to 1. get other peoples opinions and 2. try to get other suggestions on how I can somehow make either everyone "somewhat happy" or atleast understand and accept what my reasoning is behind the rules that I set.  <br>
<br>
I never saw a problem with the original loot line up, but I was always willing to listen to and consider changes that people thought that I should make.<br>
<br>
I've done Vox twice, both times I had a blast... the people who came along (most of them) told me what a wonderful time they had too.  Thats all I want out of it, and I believe atleast 70% of the people who leave the raid when its over feel it was time well spent, regardless of what they go home with.<br>
<br>
I still dont know why Vet had to jump on my post the way that he did.  It got turned into an open argument (with me in the middle) about how the loot rules were set.  I then moved the post here to hopefully get some other insight and some more advice from others, which led to several things... one of which me being flamed by friends of Vet because of the whole scenario... Im not bothered by this but Im still puzzled by how you seem to like to point out how "respected" you are or how well you run raids yet you still think its necessary to poke your noses in a raid that none of you would attend anyway.<br>
<br>
It just doesnt make sense to me.<br>
<br>
I've had a lot of my friends tell me thier opinions and why they feel the way they do... and each and every one has given GOOD reasons to why they feel that way.  But each and every one of them have also said "you do what YOU think is best"... cant you people just accept the fact that I "tried" to meet somewhere in the middle... that I "tried" to make it more fair for everyone... that I "tried" a hell of a lot harder than I had to???<br>
<br>
I dont need to score brownie points with a damn person in this game, but that doesnt mean that I dont like making friends.  I'd rather not make enemies but, shit, you're not gods, you're not elite, you're not better than anyone else... perhaps you've been around longer and seen more, but really what more is there to it than that?<br>
<br>
Yes... I am a n00b!  But who cares... that doesnt mean I have to actually feel that you are superior to me just because you've played longer and seen/done more than I have.  I've played for 6 months now... maybe you accomplished more in your first 6 months, but Im happy with what I've seen/done and I've enjoyed every single bit of it.<br>
<br>
Going on a Vox raid is awesome in my opinion, although it may make me a country bumpkin or whatever in the hell he said, its what I like to do... lead or follow I'd attend every Vox raid I can, just because I enjoy it... and believe it or not others feel the same way that I do, and yes someday maybe I'll be able to walk away with the eyepatch, but I'd still come back and kill her again.<br>
<br>
So flame me more if you wish, Im tired, but if you have nothing better to do than argue and bicker over something so insignificant, I'll humor you all I can.<br>
<br>
For the people who actually posted their thoughts on the loot (even though you dont know me)... thank you... I really wanted nothing more than feedback.<br>
<br>
For the people (friends of Vet) who had to jump on my ass... thank you for spending your valuable godly time on me.  Im flattered... really.<br>
<br>
For the friends who just offered support and such, ya'll know I love ya... *mwah*<br>

It's not that difficult to look at what the drop is, what it's uses are and decide what makes the most sense.<br>
<br>
Do you really want me to make a list of decent cloaks that drop in game OUTSIDE of dragons?  Where does the white scale drop? Vox.  Gore.<br>
Where else can you get a cloak?  Cloak of the Ice Bear?  Buy a Molten Cloak.  +4 wis, 2k or less, I took my paladin down there at level 37 and owned that gnome.  Repeatedly.  And I still have good faction. <br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is, there are numerous cloaks in the game that are significant upgrades to say, a cloak of the ice bear, and the funnel for white scales in exceedingly small.  So when you ask me who I think NEEDS it, I'd say a bard.<br>

<br>
I'm just putting my 2cp in because..um..I'm waitng for a group in OS : )<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I think that Epic items should go to the class that needs them for their Epic.<br>
<br>
If a 52 (or lower) Bard needs the item from a mob that you can only fight until level 52, only let the Bards roll.<br>
<br>
The feeling I get knowing I helped someone get a little further on their Epic Quest (or any goal) is worth more to me than equipping my avatar with phat lewt.<br>
<br>
Same for NBG rules. If some cool item drops that a group member can use, let them have it.<br>
<br>
I'd rather make in-game friends than in-game PP any day.<br>

And no, I didn't ask you to make a list.  I know what cloaks are available to me, and have access to the various site to find out, if I didn't.

Maybe with a twink, but frankly, those dragons don't interest me in the least.<br>

<br>
Aren't you being a mite oversensitive?  I reread my post, twice.  I just don't see where I got ugly about it.  I explained why *I* think that the scale is more of a bard item.  Like I said, it's terribly easy to hit 200 int/wis (except maybe for shamans, still don't know that one), as a result of that, and the fact that there are many cloaks in game that are equitable replacements, I feel that a bard should have a better chance at getting a piece that would net them a MUCH higher return.  <br>
<br>
The WDSC is AC10 (nice) wis 10 (nice) int 10(nice) mana 75 (really nice) sv cold 25 (really nice)<br>
<br>
Now, say, as a Paladin, I can definitely use the AC, the wisdom, the mana, and the CR would be awesome for assorted dragons in Velious.  Do I NEED the cloak, no.  Could I use it? Definitely.  So, it would be fair if I insisited on rolling on it? I don't think so myself.  Would I use one if I had one? Sure probably on stuff I needed CR on, but that's probably it.<br>
<br>
As I've stated previously, if you don't like the raid rules, no one has to attend.  Personally, I've only seen Naggy once, and never been on a Vox raid, wasn't that important to me, and I don't play on Emarr at all currently. (before you others start screaming about why I'm posting here then, I have an active emarr account, I just choose NOT to log in at the moment, kthx)<br>

Jex, your prima donna act is pathetic.  You don't care what anyone thinks, and you're going to do whatever you want, but you still manage to find the time to write novel length posts defending yourself.  People will kiss your butt for now, but as soon as the next dragon raid leader comes along, you'll be old news.<br>
<br>
Laoke, my gripe with Jex starting this thread isn't that flames aren't appropriate on this board (duh), but rather that she stirred the whole thing up herself.  Go read the original thread on D&amp;P.  Vet complained about her loot rules, but he did it in a polite way.  Then Jex threw a juvenile hissy fit and started calling him names.  Now she's coming here acting like a martyr.  She's just another maggot who led a couple dragon raids and thinks her shit doesn't stink any more.<br>
<br>
You can agree with Vet's opinions, or you can disagree with them.  That's all fine.  The problem here is different.  Jex can't handle the fact that someone might have the audacity to disagree with her, and so she flew off the handle and made a complete ass of herself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uterekih.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terek IH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/31/01 11:33:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG is dumb !!</span><hr size=1> Vet picked a fight plain and simple.

Hehe Sagemon seriously if you've ever raided ANYTHING more than once it can be considered pharming.  You've done it you've had the experience you know what to do.  The 2nd time is pharming as all you are gaining aside from maybe some refinement on the process is loot.  If you can argue that you need to look up hypocrisy yourself.  <br>
<br>
Unless you are one of the dweebs I saw on another post who thinks experience comes out of raids.  Hell I filled up 2 blue raiding last night since my group was getting the kill on just about everything but I've lost far more than that and any other experience I've ever gained raiding over the course of time.  And that's counting dinging 51 in Fear and 58 in Sky &lt;actually dinged 58 about 3 or 4 times over the course of that and left sky at 57 &lt;shrug&gt;.<br>
<br>
Bleh nevermind didn't wanna jump into the middle of this but I'm gonna post it anyways.<br>
<br>
Oh, on topic near as I can remember after epics have been added I believe the scales have been going to those who will use it to complete epics for the most part.  But unless you want to lead the raid STFU and don't go until someone who has loot rules you can agree with comes along.<br>

<br>
#1.  No, I'm not being oversensitive.  I'm just trying to head off at the pass, what might turn into a bitchfest between the two of us, and I'm not interested.  Sorry if it seemed defensive to you.  I've read the boards for a while, and I know what to expect. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
#2.  When referring to loot rules on a raid where epic items drop, I was thinking more along the lines of demis or epic mobs in the planes.  Is that clear enough?  Obviously, a piece from the golem in Fear is of no use to me.  So why argue about it?  If the scale for a cloak is also an epic piece, then there's going to be a fight.  Why?  My feeling is, we are ALL there killing the dragon.  The bard isn't doing it alone, but neither is a caster.  I guess it depends on the purpose of the raid.  If it's specifically FOR an epic piece, then that should be understood.  If not, it should be FFA for those that need it.  Did that answer your question?<br>
<br>
#3.  Let me reiterate... I've never been on, nor do I care to go on, a Naggy/Vox raid.  <br>
<br>
My GAWD.  Can no one voice their opinion and at least have it heard?  You don't have to agree with me.  But see it from another point of view, and quit being so tunnel-visioned.<br>
<br>
Whatever.  I'm done here.<br>

Lordy, get your point across in a few brief paragraphs.  I got sick of reading halfway through because you're repeating the same thing.<br>
<br>
Look, it's your raid, your rules - but don't expect everyone to like them.  Great, they don't like them, they don't have to come.  However, you're forgetting one thing dearie .. you're posting them on a public message board and if someone doesn't like what you say .. guess what sweetums .. they're going to call you on it.  Vet is not just some run of the mill player who just happened to buy a shaman off ebay .. he knows this game and he has done a TON of raid leading himself, so he's not talking out of his ass.  <br>
<br>
Now, go on about your dragon pharming days .. enjoy yourself and good luck on whatever the heck drops (and hopefully, you won't spend 12 hours trying to figure out who gets to random on it, based on your loot rules.) <p>Tormentcia

<br>
This is jex's quote(i don't know how to use the nifty quote editor,hehe)<br>
<br>
As far as the wis casters not rolling on the scale they get to roll on the res stick/cleric hammer IF IT DROPS just like the int casters get to roll on the scale IF IT DROPS<br>
<br>
<br>
As a shaman, and a wis caster, how does a CLERIC hammer help me?The ress stick has 10 charges, and frankly is not something most wis casters are gonna tote around.This is why i asked why the int casters get to roll on the patch and the scale, both are good for a shaman/druid, wheras the before mentioned items are really only good for only a cleric .I agree the scale either should be Bard only, or random to all that can use. Any other way is shorting the wis casters. I am not even gonna talk about the 15 wis/int eyepatch that only the int casters get.<br>
<br>
I only posted my thoughts to try to get the current dragon raiders to see a more lvl playing field,and to point out that the items are not INT only. I am sorry if it seems as though i  started a flame war. It was never my intention to do that, but what is done is done.<br>
<br>
As for being a loot whore because I posted about the loot rules, that is wrong. I can care less about loot, ask anyone in my old guild, the silvermist wolves, or anyone i have grouped with. I usually play to experience new things,sometimes to actually gain exp,hehe. But a dragon raid is done to farm the loot, hence needing fair loot rules etc. <p><BR>Vetinari<BR>Lvl 52 Shaman<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uislington.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Islington</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 456<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/31/01 1:03:10 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vetinari... in response to your most recent post...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> wheras the before mentioned items are really only good for only a cleric<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Something that has bugged me this entire flame.
