Political Reality: Inside Lags <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you are not the Economic Dictator of the U.S. (and, contrary to what many people think, neither is Alan Greenspan). So we have to make due with our current political system to enact our counter-cyclical policies. <br>
<br>
In order to combat a recession we need to go through several political and decision-making hoops. <br>
<br>
First we need to gather information on the economy and analyze it to the best of our ability. Both the Monetary policymakers (the Fed) and the fiscal policymakers (Congress and the President) each have a large number of economists who follow the economy and make recommendations. This is not an easy job and it can take a good amount of time (as in months) to fully measure and understand both how the ecnomy is currently doing as well as where it is likely to go in the future. I think the Fed has a slight advantage in this category given that it employs a large number of economists to do this and only this. (In the interest of full disclosure - I have worked at the fed and my loyalties may be affecting my judgement on this issue!) <br>
<br>
Second, once we learn that we are headed into a recession or a slowdown (or at least can make a forecast that convinces us of a looming slowdown), we then have to then make a decision as to what to do about it. Here too, the Fed has an advantage in terms of the speed in which it can move from analysis to implementation. The FOMC (the decision making body at the Fed) meets every 6 weeks or so, and can even act in between meetings as the fed did recently. <br>
<br>
On the other hand Fiscal policy requires an act of Congress and the President’s signature. This means debates, compromises, partisan fights, etc. By the time an appropriate fiscal response is enacted, the recession may very well be over. Anyone remember Clinton’s “stimulus package” proposal from 1992? The recession was over before the bill made it to the floor. Bush’s tax cut proposal is not even scheduled to be brought up until May - a full 4 months after the Fed’s first action on the economy. <br>
<br>
Finally, we have to wait for the implemented policies to have their ultimate effect on the private economy - the “outside lag” as mentioned above. On this point there is still a bit of debate as to how long it takes for policy to have its ultimate impact the economy. Most would put the main effect of a interest rate shift anywhere from 6 to 18 months after enactment. Fiscal policy probably takes longer. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Fiscal policy refers to the way in which the government exerts influence on the economy through its overall budgetary decisions. Budgetary actions that raise the growth of government expenditures, reduce the growth of revenues and either increase the deficit or reduce the surplus are the sort of fiscal policies that tend to stimulate short-term growth in the economy. Actions that trim expenditures, increase government revenues and shrink the deficit or increase the surplus tend to dampen short-term economic growth. The challenge of fiscal policy is to adopt actions that are right for the circumstances. This is not easy, because there are long and variable lags between government fiscal policy decisions and the resulting impact on the economy. Moreover, stimulative or restrictive policies can be self-defeating in the long run if they are applied persistently and indiscriminately. The government normally seeks to implement fiscal and monetary policies that together will foster steady economic growth while avoiding upward pressure on inflation.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What that says (in case you don't want to decypher the whole thing) is that intrest rate shifts take anywhere from 6 to 18 months to demonstrate their effect and that other fiscal political policies take longer.<br>
<br>
While it could be argued that the above is not a &quot;political&quot; statement, I would have to say it's pretty obvious that any governmental decision in a democratic state is *purely* motivated by political pressures.<br>

Enron was considered a model of how a corporation should be run, and all of the above three groups were willing to forgive an awful awful lot for those insane profit growth rates that many companies were reporting.  You want to toss in the Dot-com fad, and it all adds up to something that was a long long time in building.  Like, most of the 90s.  You could put a trained chimpanzee in the presidency and the economy would not tank as fast as it did in the last year or two.  It was a combination of factors.  You can argue, probably with a fair degree of legitimacy, that Bush Jr. has not done as much to fix the problem as could be hoped, but saying he or his administration caused it is frankly kinda dumb.  If you need &quot;a serious economist&quot; to tell point out the obvious fact that consequences are delayed from causes, and that in the case of the economy this delay can be quite a while... you need to pull your head out of your bum.  As far as this being for Merentha, email her if you don't want to get commented on, and don't play coy about the responses you got.  You were after them, and if you haven't caught on that seeing your name starting a thread guaranties at least a 2 page count of posters trying to smack down your latest bizarreness, then you are far less bright than you appear from your haiku's.<br>

No trying to fight a 'war' by looting a social fund is blatant partisanship.<br>
If you want to fight a war, you need to raise the taxes. There is no other way.<br>

The idea that whatever happens in the current economy can be blamed on the last admin is BS. No economist would go on record saying that. Political commentators<br>
and profit oriented business yes I suspect they will.<br>

<br>
I too believe that an impact could be immediate as well depending on the type of statement or actions made. If Bush were to come on the TV and say &quot;ok Mexico. Remember all that money you have owed us since the beginning of time?&quot;&quot; well we are coming across the border and we are going to take it out of your asses.&quot; thanks Bye. That has not happened. Nor would it ever because he cannot act on his own or just speak out of his ass. Economic Policy is a group effort. Not just his. <br>
<br>
My questions to Chit is this. Who's responsibility was the 80's and the success we shared with the world then? if I remember correctly one of the hated Republicans was in office for the better part of that decade. Was it Carter? Was it any policy that he put in place? Doubtful. It was the group effort by a president that understood bi-partisan ship and worked hard at it to make it work.<br>
<br>
People like you Chit amaze me. Facts can be looked at from sides of the fence and will always be. You can tell me that W is the antichrist for all I care. The reason that the economy is failing has very little to do with W. When was the last time that the President walked down to Congress and said &quot;Screw you guys and your policy and rules.&quot; &quot;I am going to make this a law or act on my own.&quot; &quot; I do not need you&quot;. <br>
<br>
Lesson in American Politics 101. We have checks and balances and they keep people from acting on their own. The only truly single power the President has is he can call the Marines into action for 60 days without the consent of Congress. (I may be wrong on this. it has been a few years since I was in American Govt.) He cannot enact any laws or policies without a note from his parents...err Congress. <br>
<br>
So keep playa hating Choadmaster. Last time I checked the Democrats have been in power of both houses for quite some time. Talk to them. Their just as much to blame. They make the rules. George can Veto but they can over-rule that as well. <br>

Reagan was hardly bi-partisan. Congress vetoed his little anti-nicaragua thing<br>

Corporate welfare accounts for between 3 and 10 times (depending upon whether the measurer is pro- or anti-industry) the amount of money going to individual welfare programs.

Does any of the above have anything to do with the economy? Nope! Don't blame the economy on the party in office because the economy is usually a result of the prior party. All things take time. Bush didn't create anything in 8 months. A rising or falling economy takes time. You want to blame somebody, blame Slick Willy for selling us out to the terriorist for as long as he could. <br>

<br>
I personally like the fact that you have business men in charge now. People who have actually run companies and worked in the private industry have more knowledge that career politicians. <br>
<br>
Everyone should know that raising taxes NEVER helps the economy, only lowering them does. Let's be realists here, would it be wise to take money out of peoples hands and give it to the government? Or let people keep more money to spend or invest?<br>
<br>
For those of us who live in America, remember that the top 1% of taxpayers pay over 50% of the taxes. The bottom 10% pay none. Those of us in the middle make up the rest. Remember that the next time you look at your paycheck.<br>
<br>
And since it is part of the discussion, I am neither a Republican, Democrat, or Independant. I am a Libertarian, I prefer to take most money from the government and give it to the people who actually make it.<br>
<br>
And to those that blame Bush and Co. for 9/11, remember Clinton had the chance to get him and refused. Maybe if he had been more interested in chasing bin assclown than chasing tale he would have gotten him.  <p>Flubbin<br>

I have seen idiots on both sides of the aisle, to be real brutal, and if the Dem's tend to be misguided idiots at their worse, the Republicans can be selfish or greedy bastards at *their* worse.  Thanks for painting with a broad brush though, come again!<br>
<br>
Chiteng, do a little less drugs.  You want to argue for who has the &quot;power&quot;, don't go to the freaking speaker of the house.  THat is about as cogent as arguing that Gomer in Northern WI holds the reigns to national power.  Speaker does not even have control over his own house in his own branch of government, when all is said and done, so how the hell can he have influenced the economy?<br>
<br>
Republicans causing the crises... bs.  Democraps (way to be a partisan humpmonkey by the way Caelie! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) caused it with clinton... BS.<br>
<br>
9% average profits... no sound capitalist, Democrat or Republican is going to argue with that figure.  Things were going good.  Too good, as it turned out, and yeah, you can place the blame whereever you get your happy little jollies doing so, but I flat out guaranty you that who was president over this period of time had at the very best a minor and glancing impact on the economy.  It was booming, it would have been idiocy both politically and from a general commonsense standpoint to go against that flow.  Does it suck? Yes it does, but pinning it on either party is about as useful as staring at the offal in the toilet to figure out what food its made from... IT DOESN'T FREAKING MATTER.<br>
<br>
How the administration handles the issue? Yeah, real valid arguement.  How they hold folks accountable, whether or not they over or underregulate, all very useful and cogent points of discussion.  Claiming that it is a republican or democratic plot, contrivance, or scheme is frankly stupid. <p><center><IMG SRC=" http://www.unicorntrad.org/mal_sig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uskerrynb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SkerryNB</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/16/02 11:59:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flubman</span><hr size=1> First of all Chit I hope you are happy.<br>

The only reason for posting this is to get the limelight for a while. Not that you don't have plenty of it in other threads. Sadly,  this throws you smack dab in the middle of the "troll" category.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for not saying it is the presidents fault,  but the party itself.  Yes, your initial post indicates disdain for the party, albeit in a roundabout way.<br>
<br>
However, the rest of your responses indicate presidents as being reasons or basis of comparisons, and thus it is quite natural for normal people to extract that you are blaming the president.  Quite frankly,  you are.  However, reading enough of your posts it is painfully obvious you will not understand that simple tidbit so Iam not expecting any miracles here.<br>
<br>
I am however amazed that you need so much attention that the other threads are not good enough,  you needed to start up your own to feed your need for chaos and discord.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact that economic effects are rippled throughout administrations is an old, old concept.  Taught in many economy classes as a contributing factor.  That is contributing, not sole.  That means that it does have an effect but is not the sole reason for an economic growth or decline.<br>
<br>
Outside of that,  9-11 had an impact (Hardly the republicans fault),  as does corporate america getting caught with their pants down.  Investors are backing away out of mistrust in major companies.  Smaller companies are unable to find funding due to the mistrust investors are having.  People are unable to find jobs because the companies are losing investors and thus are unable to staff as they wish.  It really is quite simple to see.   Guess what,  this is not the republicans fault either.   This is the corporations screwing it up for the rest of us.   Also,  Bush got screwed by this also.  Granted,  he isn't the brightest guy we have had in office. . but even he would not do thing such to screw himself.<br>
<br>
Anyway,  I don't know why I am even trying to explain this to you. You have your beliefs, and are incapable and unwilling to try any other thoughts than your own because you are all knowing and all powerful. <br>
<br>
Let me save you the trouble by the way.   I have not offered any valid proof,  I do not know my history,  I do not know how businesses are run,  you are not trying to get attention that is the misguided perception of a weak minded person like myself.  You want solid evidence where you said that bush was the problem, otherwise I should STFU....I need to stop listening to Rush (Didnt even know he was still doing his thing, that is how much I listen btw)....  I need to stop beign delusional or whatever your word of the day calendar has up at the time...  <br>
<br>
I am sure I missed some but these are the basic ideas behind most of your responses to anyone who disagrees with you so I figured I would help ya out and let you work on some new ones.<br>
<br>
Enjoy, and have a great day.<br>

Just taking some issues from your own post:<br>
Who controls the House? Who refuses to enact the campaign finance reform?<br>
Which party falls lockstep into position the instant that ANYONE mentions<br>
corporate controls? If a serious bill was entered to constrain business in any way<br>
I have absolutely no doubt it would be fillibustered to death.<br>
The current justice department lets Microsoft off the hook when they are CLEARLY GUILTY. Years of litigation wasted. MS has not altered what it does one iota except how it handles internal memos.<br>
<br>
Supposedly we are at war, and the body count shows the bad guys winning,<br>
but no one is raising taxes to pay for it.<br>
<br>
I live two blocks from the unemployement office. It is sad to see the line in the morning when I drive to work. I have personal freinds that have been out of work in their field for over a year. I use to have 14 freinds working at Nortel, I now have <br>
ONE. He is bailing on his own with the comment 'why wait around to be wacked'<br>
<br>
These are good people my freind, even if you insist on not liking me, surely you admire talent. They work at McDonalds to pay the rent. Some had to sell with just 15% equity. Yet oddly enough the right goes blythly on ignoring what is happening.<br>
<br>
And all I hear out of the White House is posturing for re-election. I dont want to hear that. I want to hear how he intends to solve the unemployment. Bin Laden can wait.<br>

As for bankrupting the SS fund, it is already broke. My generation, the Gen Xer's, will not have any Social Security when we have to retire.

We have to fight this war. If we let bin buttmunch go do you not think he won't hit again?<br>

A very simple solution to most of the woes is to cut programs that don't work, get rid of government waste and have a flat tax. We could save billions and get the people back their money.<br>
<br>
As for campaign finance reform, it is illegal and goes against the very foundation of the Bill of Rights. The right of Free Speech is something that everyone has, no matter how stupid their speech is. More laws on the books will not help those who don't obey the law to begin with. That goes for company CEO's, politicians, and gun owners!! <p>Flubbin<br>

That is the most idiotic statement I've ever read in my entire life!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE learn some history before you start stuff like this!  Not only does it NOT MATTER which party was in power during this time (they were both radically different than they are today), but the Democratic reforms that FDR used were opposed by most of the members of BOTH parties.  That's right, your prescious Democrats didn't like the idea of the government getting all involved in everyone's life.<br>

But then there will still be idiots that will say keeping the crisis atmosphere is a good idea.<br>

<br>
As far as the current economic situation, I place a good share of the blame on slicky Willy for 2 reasons:<br>
<br>
1)  Failure to deal with Bin Laden<br>
<br>
I think it was '96 when Bin Laden was offered up to the U.S. government.  He had been captured and was being held by the Sudanese government.  Clinton said to let him go.<br>
<br>
2)  Urging the Fed to raise interest rates during the end of his administration<br>
<br>
The economy was doing great during the years that the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress.   Given the fact that Clinton was a huge embaressment for the Democrats, as well as the country, the Democrats realized that the Republicans were going to get the White House.<br>
<br>
With this knowledge, and their plans to start regaining control of Congress in 2002 and Congress/Presidency in 2004, Clinton started urging Greenspan to raise the Fed dramatically.   Clinton's economists realized that the slowing down of the economy wouldn't take place until a year or so down the road.  Then the Democrats could claim that the slowing of the economy was the Republicans fault.<br>
<br>
Just as predicted, the economy seriously started slowing down right about the time that Bush was taking office.  Even without 9/11 tradegy and more recent corporate scandals, the economy would have slowed down.  One of the first things Bush did when taking office was to start putting pressure on Greenspan to lower the Fed.  You are already starting to see major signs that the economy is looking better.  Because of 9/11 and recent scandals the recovery will take a bit longer, but you will see the economy really booming again by late/spring early summer of next year.<br>
