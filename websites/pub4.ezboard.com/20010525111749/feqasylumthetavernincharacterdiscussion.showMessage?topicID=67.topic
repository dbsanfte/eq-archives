Before me, at the end of the ravine that led to the zone were two Humans; one named Palman and the other named Shlick. I stopped in my tracks as I noticed each of them watch me from a distance. I burst out with a RAAAAAAR! to see what they would do. Surprisingly, they backed up. I felt like toying with them a bit because I thought they were roleplaying so I RAAAAAR’d again. They continued to back up. <br>
<br>
I removed my SoW, ducked and slowly crept towards them. I took a few steps and let out another RAAAAAAR! They ran backwards and turned around to see where I was. I was laughing so hard at this point in time because I thought they were playing along with me. I started to walk towards them and with every step I took forward they walked backwards, careful not to take their eyes of me. <br>
<br>
I started hitting my Jboots hotkey over and over and over as fast as I could to release the red spell effect that surrounds your body when you use them. I walked at them while casting…and I think that kinda tripped them out because they ran away. I ran after them while I continued to cast the Jboots over and over and they zoned back into Qeynos Hills. I was laughing so hard at this point in time that I had to share the story with my guild. I don’t think any of them thought it was funny. Anyway, I sat there and waited to see if they were going to zone back in. First, Palman zoned in and then a few seconds later Shlick zoned.<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:11:04 2001] You say, ‘hehehe, why did you run away?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:11:15 2001] Shlick says, ‘I thought you were going to attack me’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:11:23 2001] You say, ‘hehehe, I can’t attack you.’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:11:36 2001] Shlick says, ‘You scared me’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:11:43 2001] You say, ‘I am sorry, I thought you were playing with me as I was playing with you. =/’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:12:24 2001] You say, ‘You have ever seen an Ogre before?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:12:24 2001] Shlick says, ‘nope’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:12:31 2001] You say, ‘Never?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:12:38 2001] You say, ‘I am your first Ogre sighting?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:12:43 2001] Shlick says, ‘thought you were going to kill me lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:12:52 2001] You say, ‘No no...I only eat Gnomes. They are good on a stick.’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:12:58 2001] You say, ‘Gnomes are also good in cookie form.’<br>
<br>
I started thinking how much time I had left before the Vox raid and decided I had enough time to tell these two people a short story. I make stories up from time to time for people I come across who seem to be new to the game so they get a good impression of player interaction on the server. They looked new to the game; Palman had but 2 pieces of bronze on and Shlick had nothing. Though he was a Wizard, he looked like a new Monk. Plus, they had never seen an Ogre before, so that clued me in that they really were new to the game. I handed them some jewels to sell and a handful of plat to help them out a bit.<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:13:46 2001] You say, ‘Wanna hear a story?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:13:52 2001] Shlick says, ‘sure’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:00 2001] You say, ‘It is a short story’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:04 2001] Palman says, ‘sure’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:10 2001] You say, ‘Please, have a seat’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:22 2001] You say, ‘Shlick, do you have any brothers?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:28 2001] You say, ‘Palman, so you have any sisters?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:33 2001] Shlick says, ‘yes 3’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:36 2001] Palman says, ‘no’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:46 2001] You say, ‘ok’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:14:53 2001] You say, ‘Shlick, what is the name of your oldest sister?’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:15:02 2001] Shlick says, ‘jessica’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:15:18 2001] You say, ‘Our good friend Palman here is going to play the hero...and Jessica will be the damsel in distress....’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:15:28 2001] Shlick says, ‘hehe ok’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:15:37 2001] Palman says, ‘ok’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:15:38 2001] You say, ‘A long time ago, in a land not too far away, lived this mighty dragon named Lady Vox’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:16:01 2001] You say, ‘Lady Vox was a cruel and evil dragon who flew under the cover of night to capture wandering souls that walked obliviously in the night.’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:16:39 2001] You say, ‘She would swoop down on them and pierce her claws through their chest...causing them to bleed to death as she carried them away to her underground cave where she would devour them’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:17:05 2001] Shlick gasps at Smashin in astonishment.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:17:23 2001] Palman beams a smile at Smashin.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:17:23 2001] You say, ‘The common folk grew weary of the beast’s murderous ways and took up arms to rid their beautiful lands of this vile beast’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:17:56 2001] You say, ‘Together, a band of powerful warriors and wizards gathered in the Blackbburrow area to go over strategy....’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:18:31 2001] You say, ‘The entire raid was led by a mighty Paladin named Palman’<br>
<br>
Right then, this dumb bastard interrupts my story…<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:18:57 2001] Tolony Marle says ‘Rodcet Nife!!  Give me strength to smite your foe!! <br>

[Thu Mar 08 21:19:21 2001] You make a rude gesture at Tolony Marle.<br>
<br>
No sooner than I slap Tolony down do I turn around to see a Werewolf beating up on poor Shlick.<br>

[Thu Mar 08 21:25:46 2001] Kamukuk points at Smashin. Yeah you!<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:25:51 2001] You told Kamukuk, ‘I am telling a story!’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:25:53 2001] You told Kamukuk, ‘sit down and have a listen. =)’<br>
<br>

<br>
The story was going well…until the heckler spoke up…<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:27:56 2001] Kamukuk says, ‘And the morale of this story is; If you love someone, set them free. If they don’t return to you, hunt them down and kill them.’.<br>

[Thu Mar 08 21:28:01 2001] You say, ‘...and then they ran into the Ice Giants. Having never seen Ice Giants before, they were paralyzed by the sheer size of them.’<br>

[Thu Mar 08 21:30:43 2001] You say, ‘The cry pierced through the cold air and into the ears of the members in the group which gave them strength to  fight on...braver...more focused...they had to help the person who was crying for help.’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:31:19 2001] You say, ‘One Ice Giant fell...then another...then another...the battle swung in favor of the humans.’<br>

[Thu Mar 08 21:32:18 2001] Oshin says, ‘Did they go back to the Pub, instead?’.<br>
<br>
Sensing another heckler in the crowd, I readied my Scooby Do ending…<br>
<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:32:21 2001] You say, ‘They collected their thoughts, bandaged their wounds, sharpened their swords...and listened to words of valor, glory and inspiration as spoken by their leader Palman’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:32:30 2001] Oshin says, ‘Oop, excuse me.’.<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:32:42 2001] You say, ‘And then Oshin died...and they all laughed...’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:32:48 2001] You say, ‘oh wait, different story’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:33:30 2001] You say, ‘Anyway, they gathered their spirits and concentrated their energies...they had to save the person who was Vox’s prisoner and defeat the mighty dragon once and for all to save their lands’<br>

[Thu Mar 08 21:34:15 2001] You say, ‘Slowly creeping down the icy hallways, the cries for help grew stronger, as did the stench of a hundred rotting corpses that once made similar cries for help’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:34:27 2001] You say, ‘Hmm....lemme think’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:34:29 2001] You say, ‘no’<br>

[Thu Mar 08 21:34:58 2001] You say, ‘Palman held the group at bay right before the secret door that leads to her room....’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:36:05 2001] You say, ‘He said, &quot;People, we have fought bravely, but this battles we have fought to get to this point mean nothing if we don’t complete our task. From this day forth, we humans will determine our own fate...not some monster that swoops down on us for dinner in the middle of the night. ...&quot;‘<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:36:37 2001] You say, ‘&quot;..Power be thy guide, Glory be your reward, Freedom be your reason...here and now we will kill this dragon!&quot;‘<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:36:56 2001] You say, ‘The people cheered Palman...and they readied their blades.’<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:37:48 2001] You say, ‘Palman said, &quot;The first wave will be Warriors...when I call for Warriors to fight, rush the beast and swing your sword with every intent of killing it. Shlick, when I give you the signal, tell your casters to cast every spell they have at it!&quot;‘<br>
[Thu Mar 08 21:38:28 2001] You say, ‘The word was given and shortly thereafter, the Warriors charged the beast with fury and anger.’<br>
