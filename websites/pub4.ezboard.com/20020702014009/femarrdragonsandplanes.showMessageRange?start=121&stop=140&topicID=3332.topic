That's the problem right there, Raed. You flame people rather than try to communicate with them, and you should not be proud of it! It makes you look pretty stupid and the irony is funny. You flame people as less than intelligent and as being delusional (and you have used the same tired content with those other than Chiteng); where as, you seem to delude yourself into thinking you're some bad a<i></i>ss flamer with novel wit. Truth is you have exhausted your content with repeated asinine remarks.<br>

Oh, well, the time I have spent on this thread is not worth it. Flame away, Raed! That is all <i>you</i> think your good for anyway.<br>

He's probably been the subject of half to 2/3's of my usage of the phrase, thereby pumping up the numbers, but I don't believe that's particularly damning.  It so happens that I enjoy poking at folks that are so self-absorbed that they don't understand or relate with the rest of the world, or think that their own vision of reality is the only one with merit.  [Yes, I see the irony in how that can be applied to my own posts on the board, although I disagree, so let's just move on.]<br>
<br>
I disagree with your conclusion that I don't try and communicate with people, and only flame.  I believe it is possible to do both.  Don Rickles, George Carlin and many other comics have used ridicule as quite effective means of communication.  I'm not arrogant enough to put myself into the same sphere as them, I'm just using them as examples that flaming and communication aren't mutually exclusive.<br>
<br>
As I've said on many occasions, I try and get people to think.  Sure, not in every post, but I do make the effort.  Often my method involves being caustic.  If that is too harsh for you, the Barney EZBoard is pretty easy to find.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I've never considered myself a bad-ass flamer.  A novel wit, sure.  As I've received a number of compliments from folks that had more than a few active brain cells (Aphroditex being the most recent) stating the same, I think I'll stick with that one.<br>
<br>
And actually, I don't limit myself to flaming or think that is all I can do.  It's most of what I do here, but this is a RANTS AND FLAME board after all.  Discussing theoretical physics, the bioethical challenges of cloning or the new Barbie Dream Date Game on the XBox wouldn't be appropriate.<br>
<br>
<br>
But, you are right, I've been a little more harsh than usual on this board.  I'm pretty pissed off at the game and WeRant due to the bugs and time sinks I can't get around any longer by soloing.  I'll try and tone it down some.  My shrink says I have anger management problems.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I think he's full of shyt. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1626<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/14/02 5:53:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3332.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anonymous Hoser Number Two</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then there's this dude carathos...he tells me that he doesnt compete either...whatever...im guessing we can take his number of posts up to the fourth power, and multiply that by a hundred and we will have his number of days played. but of course, all of those days played were helping the poor starving gnomes of akanon.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Please point out where I said I don't compete.

I had ~200 played days between May 99 and December 01.  And, if you must know, most of that time was spent helping my friends and guildmates.  Some time was spent getting exp and some time was spent questing for myself.  Happy?  I don't remember flaming you because of how you spent your time, only for being a complete moron.<br>
<br>
Now I know why, whenver I heard the name Ultimo in game, it was followed by &quot;what a loser&quot;.  You certainly live up to your reputation.  Cheers fuckface! <p>Carathos Ollathir<br>

Alot of comments and rants by people who dont even play anymore...who whine about stuff that they dont even have to deal with because they DON'T play EQ; but of course they still think their opinion is more important then the people who still play.<br>

Of course, for some reason; Tweety gets brought up..and well I have to agree with the comment about her being a sell-out. She is also rude as hell and a bit of a smartass..but its her choice of how she wants to be known.<br>
<br>
Now for a few things for Raedwulf...I work in fast food...do I always like it? Hell no..it pays the bills though...I make good money in management...what sucks is dealing with the F uck heads that come in there acting like we are scum because we work in fast food...now if I was to come into their workplace and treat them the same way, I would most likely be kicked out..but we deal with it..<br>

Wrong...life is about competition. If you do nothing to further yourself, you will be nothing.

<br>
I never stated that the two comments contradict one another.  I only pointed out that you were quick to label somebody a &quot;twit&quot; for not knowing who Tweety is, and you have reckoned that Tweety is commonly accepted as a &quot;veritable goddess amongst&quot; - and I quote - &quot;all MMORPG'ers&quot;, thereby, somebody he should be familiar with.  Your statement indicates not only a universal knowledge of this person's existence within the various MMORPG communities, but a general consensus that this person is upheld in those communities as a &quot;veritable goddess&quot;.<br>
<br>
First, your claim that Tweety is held in said esteem by &quot;all MMORPG'ers&quot; is nullified in the fact that Ultimo plays EverQuest, a MMORPG, and he does not know who this person is.  Your insinuation that &quot;all MMORPG'ers&quot; know Tweety is moot and cannot be argued because at least one &quot;MMORPG'er&quot; has admitted to not knowing who Tweety is.  Furthermore, while I cannot support this statement with evidence here and now, the laws of probability would have me believe that Ultimo is not the only person playing an MMORPG who doesn't know who Tweety is.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I've seen more than one post here in this thread from people who don't share your sentiments about Tweety being a &quot;veritable goddess&quot;.  These opinions nullify the remainder of your statement, which implies that she is in high and favorable standing among &quot;all MMORPG'ers&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, since you seem to have missed my point - or just chose to call it a flawed contradiction and moved on - I'll spell it out in more words for you.  For somebody that you hold in such high regard, you don't seem to be very knowledgable of Tweety's recent actions.  It's clearly evident that not &quot;all MMORPG'ers&quot; think as highly of your &quot;veritable goddess&quot; as you do.<br>
<br>
'But I just said I didn't follow her actions when she joined Mythic, MO!  Didn't you read that?'<br>
<br>
I did, but in the context in which you mentioned her status, you adopted the stance that Tweety was still the &quot;veritable goddess&quot; you believed her to be: &quot;Tweety, a veritable goddess amongst all MMORPG'ers&quot;, not &quot;Tweety, at one point a veritable goddess among many MMORPG'ers&quot;; notice the difference.  Is that really true?  Do ALL MMORPG'ers <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> feel this way about her?  My guess is that your statement was an embellishment you fabricated in an attempt to amplify her importance, feeling it would further support your attempt to berate Ultimo for not knowing someone of such obvious significance in the MMORPG community.<br>
<br>
If Ultimo is a &quot;twit&quot; for not knowing who Tweety is, you are at least a half-twit for making such uneducated assessments regarding &quot;all MMORPG'ers&quot; perception of this Tweety person.  Ultimo didn't know who she was, and said as much.  You called him a &quot;twit&quot; for it.  You didn't know that Tweety had fallen from the good graces of many MMORPG players, and made a false statement regarding other players' opinions of her.  I called you a half-twit for it.  You're absolutely right, your two statements don't contradict each other, but then, I never said they did.  Does that make my point any clearer?  If it's still too &quot;transparent and off-base&quot; (wow, doesn't the use of multiple big words and adjectives make a post sound so much more intelligent?), let me know, and I'll rethink a way to restate it, yet again, in a manner you can hopefully digest.<br>
<br>
I wonder if - after bringing yourself up to speed on the more recent actions of Tweety - she would still be this &quot;veritable goddess&quot; you claim she is.  I wonder if you would even bother checking her more recent actions, or if you would simply prefer to continue holding her up on this pedestal that has long since fallen away in the eyes of many of your fellow players.  Okay, enough about that &quot;hmm, I wonder...&quot; stuff.<br>
<br>
Regarding any other posts I've made in other forums or threads, if you are really so perturbed at my comments that you'll go searching through my posts to look for any possible opportunity to flame me, at least go to those threads to flame.  Don't do it here.  Cross-thread flaming just makes things convoluted and messy.<br>
<br>
While my personal life is of no consequence to you, I'll humor you this once: no, I'm not Chiteng's wife.  However, I'm someone you seem to feel threatened by, to garner your trash-talking, rather than your typical pseudo-intelligent (no, I'm sorry - knowing a few big words and using them to ad nauseam does not qualify as intelligence) berating.  Speaking of big words, the link to Webster's wasn't so much for the dictionary, but more for the thesaurus.  When I commented on your overuse of some words, I overestimated your capacity to discern which resource to explore in order to help mitigate that redundancy.<br>
<br>
Anyway, for the record, I never claimed to be the &quot;board psychiatrist&quot;, nor is it a role I believe exists.  Most people here are capable of rational, intelligent thought, and don't need psychiatric help.  Your inference that there are enough &quot;delusional&quot; people posting to this board to merit the role of a &quot;board psychiatrist&quot; - and that you are suited to fill that role - could be construed as some kind of self-worth/inferiority issue, if you're not careful.  Your assumption that I somehow filled this role is your delusion (oh, look!  a word you know!), not mine.  However, if it makes you feel a little more important being known as the &quot;board pychiatrist&quot;, I'll humor you, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> doctor!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Hey, can I call you &quot;doc&quot; for short?!<br>

<br>
Then, she got a really really good job doing something really really difficult.  A job.  A job that pays her rent.  A job that she probably wants to do well.  A job where she doesn't have the same freedom as a semi-anonymous guide who liked to occasionally rant on a small server board.  A job where she is accountable for what she says.<br>
<br>
I had an opportunity to see Absor speak during a &quot;community session&quot; at the Seattle Fan Faire.  Absor was alone in a small, closed, dark room with about 30 rabid, whiney Everquest fans.  He didn't always tell the players what they wanted to hear, but he was always composed.<br>
<br>
If Tweety has a similar job with Mythic, she has my sympathy.  It must be hard for her to curb that acid tongue, to always speak with the good of the company in mind.<br>
<br>
Guess what, people, that's not &quot;selling out,&quot; that's doing your job, showing a certain loyalty for the company, the company that writes your check.<br>
<br>
I miss Tweety on Emarr, she had an amazing command of the &quot;rant&quot; and she definitely had her finger on the pulse of the player community and our shared experiences.  I hope she's doing well.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The Rant Heard Round the World:<br>
Try Being A Guide, You Nutless Assmuncher<br>
<br>
Here's some background - I've been a guide since March. I took a month off in protest of some seriously @#%$ up guide policies, and a total lack of communciation between VI and their customer service staff. I came back to discover Verant got their @#%$ together, and now it's the players that suck. Some of you assholes are up way past your bedtime.<br>
<br>
Get a clue, pissants - Neither I, nor anyone else breathing actually gives a @#%$ about how so and so stole your orc. Furthermore, no one cares that you lost the roll for whatever piece of crap weapon, because guess what? In five levels that piece of trash will be on your fourth twink and you'll be complaining about some other l33t weapon. (Note to a_pissant00: DO you know how retarded you sound petitioning over how you were ripped off AFTER YOU ROLLED FOR IT AND LOST? What the @#%$ do you think I'm going to do? That's right, genius, I'm going to ask your group TO ROLL FOR THE ITEM. If you already rolled, I'm not going to do anything but ROLL my eyes and curse the malformed sperm that somehow beat out all the healthy ones and created you in some horrible genetic accident.)<br>
<br>
Next, the guide rezz. NOBODY over level 20 should be confused or surprised by the incredibly limited powers a guide has. I can rezz you if 1) You zoned into lava, 2) Died due to Verant crashing (not you and your dial up, VERANT), and 3) Died to a confirmed bug. Otherwise, I can't do it. I would love to, but I can't. I have died to plenty of un-confirmed bugs myself, I know it sucks, and I still can't do it. It's not all about you and how I hate you because you aren't in an uber guild. Guess what, moron? I DON'T PLAY ON YOUR SERVER. I do not know, nor do I give two shits about the status of the guilds on your server. &gt;Elite Cockjockeys&lt; and <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Lords of Jizz&lt; means exactly the same to me - NOTHING. I rezz every single person I can, because I know exactly how much losing a week's worth of work to something not my fault sucks. If I don't rezz you, it isn't personal. So shut the @#%$ up about how I would have done it if you were a member of <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ancing Dickbeaters&lt;.<br>
<br>
Let's move on to sending tells to a guide. I logged in tonight to find myself the only guide with count 'em FORTY petitions waiting to be answered. Sorry, Mr. I can't find my super twinked body and I'm only level 2 and a forty minute walk to my corpse. Not only do people like you disgust me on general principles, but the guy who's been waiting for three hours stuck on a gate in Permafrost TAKES PRIORITY OVER YOU. Read the rules, dipshit. I take calls by petition, not by your sad sack tell of woe. And cussing at me, screaming at me, and telling me what a rotten person I am makes me accidentally camp out when I finally clear the monster backup and get to your whiny ass. Don't send me tells, assholes. The ten minutes I end up wasting asking you nicely to send a petition (or if you sent one, the twenty minutes I spend telling you it's not your turn yet) means that much longer of a wait.<br>
<br>
Play nice policies. My personal feelings aside (lay off the wacky weed, Verant), I get to enforce it. Do you know how much I hate you at the end of a long shift? What kind of @#%$ thinks the king room in Lower Guk can be shared by TWO GROUPS OF 12? Conversely, what kind of screaming @#%$ thinks it's okay to camp the king room for 36 hours? I think you both suck. The only people lamer than you are the ones that PNP over derv camps in North Ro and then act surprised when I send one group to the DESERTED derv camp a 30 second walk away.<br>
<br>
Boats. Hey, Einstein, before you petition me that the boats are broken, do an /ooc and find out when the boat left. If it was two minutes ago, IT'S NOT HERE YET.<br>
<br>
Quests. All I have to say to you phat lewt motherfuckers who have wrecked every quest I've been involved in is grow up, shut up, go back to Quake or whatever blow @#%$ up video game you came from, and get the @#%$ away from the quest area. It's your ten bucks, go somewhere and kill stuff. Why the hell do you feel compelled to ruin the once every blue moon event we have for the seven people (who ALSO pay the ten bucks) who actually want to role play?<br>
<br>
Illiterate people. I am NOT talking about the English as a second language kids. I go through those slowly and calmly, and more than once I've resorted to typing /ooc Anyone in this zone speak BOTH Japanese and English? By illiterate, I mean you @#%$ cretins who send me petitions that read &quot;Ur gona get my coprse rezzed, plz.&quot; What the hell am I, psychic? How did you die, where did you die, and so on is stuff I need. If you tell me in a format I can comprehend without calling over my twelve year old neighbor, I will send you a tell that says, &quot;Hang on, let me check out your corpse. Yep, you died to that bug all right. Here's your rezz. Good luck, friend.&quot; Your @#%$ cryptic petitions mean ten minutes of agonizingly rotten typing and stupidity that have me wondering where the hell I left my universal translator. Plus, any petition I get in dewdspeak automatically biases me against you. Why? Because it's the d00ds that are usually trying to snow me, and get something for nothing (like a free rez for a death caused by jumping off a wizard spire with 150 HP), and who feel entitled to absolutely everything.<br>
<br>
The only thing more annoying than dewd petitions are the ones that say &quot;Hurp.&quot; When I finally discover that &quot;Hurp&quot; means you were duelling someone named Hurp who promised not to use magic in a duel, and it turned out he had a 49th level cleric HP buff up, and you want me to use the broadcast command to tell the world what a cheater he is, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.<br>
<br>
Scumbags. I may not know who the uberguilds are, but I sure as hell know who the scumbags are. You're the one who caused a dozen petitions because you were spamming the zone with &quot;So and so is a faggot.&quot; You're the one who trained all the bouncers to the CT entrance just to @#%$ with the kids inside trying to escape the lizard train your twin brother created on purpose. You're the one who backed a female wood elf character into a corner, calling her names and sending her foul tells. You're the one who tricked the player with poor English skills into believing a trading a GLS for a whatever-piece-of-@#%$ was a good trade because you were giving him a lore item. I know you. Don't get all @#%$ bent because I told the GM not to change your name and let you duck your reputation. Don't be shocked that I never rule in your favor in PNP situations. And don't waste your time crying to another guide about how I hate you, because there are only six guides on the entire server who show up for work, and we talk.<br>
<br>
Speaking of the aforementioned female wood elf and other forms of sexual harassment - there are two sides to this one as well. It happens. It happens a lot. Unsolicited tells, really truly disgusting emotes, and situations in which one lonely knob beater chases a female avatar from West Freeport to Emerald Jungle - it HAPPENS. You people sicken me. That said, I have very little sympathy for the person behind a character named Likkmebrestesses who types /em wants to have some fun with the brawny barbarian! and then complains when said barbarian asks if she'd like to go cyber in the hidden inn. Or my favorite, the gnomes who petition when someone says &quot;You're the perfect height... for a b.... eer.&quot; Get a sense of humor already. You make it harder for people actually being harassed.<br>
<br>
If my little hissy fit keeps ONE SINGLE IDIOT from sending a petition because he's going to get laughed at, I did something good today. I sure as hell feel better.<br>

I really don't think I have ever seen an intelligent post by you and I figured I would point that out...<br>
<br>
Tweety didn't bitch about verant NEARLY as much as she ranted about the droves of idiots, beggers, whiners, and annoying people that make up 80% of this game.  She hoped that by providing better customer service it would cut that figure down to maybe 50%(since a good amount of the bitching back then was about verants very shoddy CS) and thus make the game more enjoyable for those of us who want to actually play it and not whine about the more powerful classes the the main uberguild is made up mostly of.  <br>
<br>
She was definitely one of the people in the know when it came to the community of emarr and you can tell that by going and looking at her post back then and looking at the positive comments as opposed to the negative comments.  People could relate to her, and did look to her as kind of a voice for the collective frustration that we all feel on occasion while playing this game.  <br>
<br>
now this has gone a bit off topic, so let me bring it back by saying.. who cares really.. no one does.. we all know that neither MF or Magister has to spy on the other to do things.  They are both skilled guilds, with many great members and a few hardcore asses.  So quit patting your backs and trying to prove that your dicks are bigger.. just play and have fun.. jesus. <p><align=right>

Don't like retirees posting on this board?  Too @#%$ bad.  Never said, nor implied, that my opinion was any more or less important than anyone else's, but I'm damn sure going to give it.  Also, I don't see how your rant about people like me posting is any less of a whine than me stating my opinion.  Get a grip. <p>Carathos Ollathir<br>

<br>
This kinda confuses me.  How does she have courage to speak out when she stands to lose nothing?  Rather, it takes courage to speak out when you do have something to lose(ie, her job at mythic).  It would stand to reason then that she does not have said courage or balls because at her job for mythic she has zipped her lips.  Isn't this why people are calling her a sell-out?<br>

Even if competition isnt at the forefront of your mind, its certainly a pervasive part of everyone's lives whether they want it to be or not.  Go back a few thousand years when everyone competed for food...and the only thing which has changed since the environment you compete in.  Games are just an extension to how people compete.<br>
