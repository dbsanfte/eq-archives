Not only that but extending it to the point where real life threats (account hacking) are being made and the harassment is not just 'in-game' anymore?  As more people come forth it becomes apparent Nom/Ins/Vind's behaviour isn't isolated to the original post...<br>
<br>
Sounds pretty bad and incredibly 'shit-list worthy' to me.  I would think this is grounds for account warning, suspension, or banning.  In fact for some of you who are really experiencing a lot of grief from him...this shit-list isn't enough, get on the phone and make some phone calls, and/or send out some e-mails to VI.  <br>
<br>
Even if he leaves you alone from now on, that's no reason to keep quiet and let it blow over.  What's to say he won't find another target?  That's the pattern of behaviour he's exhibited so far... <br>

He got most of his equipment from the money he made from essence emeralds. I was the one that sacced nomaru and gave his equipment to his (then) level 7 erudite paladin, inspiration. He didn't seem to bad at the time, was a good kid.. a tad annoying at times, but a good guy. I was a little suspicious though, when he gave me no reason why he changed characters. About a week later, when I was farming frenzied, he sent me a tell asking if the guild was talking about him.. I told him I couldn't say, but they weren't.. that was really, really odd. From what I read here, well, he needs help, badly. I could tell he was vindication from his sigs on this forum.. they generally all look alike, and whenever he changes characters, he makes a new forum account, and then brags about he is good at making sigs. I asked if it was him in game and he said it was.. Vindication is an iksar monk. Now this is the part that gets me.. why did he restart a monk? That is plain retarded.. that was about the time I figured he has serious rep problems. But anyways, definitly steer clear of this guy or anyone on this forum that has sigs that look like his (heh).. he has serious mental issues. I know the private Nyaa boards are private, but let me tell you this.. that board is literally CLUTTERED with posts of &quot;stay away from this guy&quot; etc.<br>

A) You disguilded and we let you back in. b) You disguild again after someone insulted you in guild, I asked you to forgive me after that BECAUSE yes because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lost my patience with you and yelled at you. I was pretty harsh, and i knew i had been in the wrong at that point in time for yelling at you. I didn't like people having hard feelings towards me so yes, i did ask you to forgive me, and at the time i did value you as a friend. Now as for me being the only officer who did not want you back in... alright. I'll be truthful now. I was sparing your feelings. It was the ENTIRE GUILD with the exception of Tahs who did not want you back. All i did was point out that you did not have a mature way of dealing with issues you had in guild with people. As i said, the guild was asked to put you on ignore, and if they didn't it was their own decision and they were left to deal with you as they saw fit. The other officers told you it was not them because i asked them to. I asked them to pretend they knew nothing in order to keep them from being harassed by you as well, because i KNOW when i told you that you had been voted out you had fire in those eyes and revenge on the mind. You voiced that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> loudly to me.<br>
<br>
You have and you STILL to this very DAY continue to harass my guild members. Not only that but you lied to me when i sent you a tell to leave them alone. &quot;Who is this? I am not Inspiration, i am just his messenger. Just a friend&quot; or some BS like that and here you clearly state that IS your character.<br>

<br>
<br>
Now, not only did you harass Nanda, but you were bothering me at the same time. Constantly sending tells saying &quot;I love you, like a sis you know...well maybe more&quot; and crap like that. To which i did the most polite thing i could do... try and ignore them. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   And about Nandanine, i never harassed her either. If she said i was in guild chat, than it was her husband playing and he really do'nt like me for some reason...wonder why. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Hmm, yeh wonder why he doesn't like you. Maybe because you hit on his wife constantly?! And no, i have never seen Nandy logged on and it been her husband. Her husband has his own characters to play anyways. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    I never harassed your members. only one i ever harassed was Nandy's hubby, the only reason i harassed him, was cuz i talked to him thinking he was nandy and he got pissed cuz of that<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> News flash, that IS my guild member, and someone who never spoke up about being bothered by you. Guess he can dish it right back huh? He's a tough cookie. <br>
<br>
The only thing i have against you now is that you are a lame-o POS who has nothing better to do than log on with different characters and harass my guildies. You are more immature than I have ever been in my entire life, and it shows. Lay off my guildies already. <br>
<br>
Also i think this post you made is somewhat mute as people have already come forward and spoken against you. Why would they make all this stuff up about you? To back me up? I don't evne know half of these people who posted. If they have stories I don't know why they would have reason to have made them up. <br>
<br>
Oh, and reminding people of anything you did for them at one time (mostly these gifts you've given out) will never cancel out your guilt if you did something wrong to them. I can give Livak a million dollars and then kill her family, you think she'll still be my friend after that? (Sorry for the harsh example Liv, but i figured it would have to work)<br>
<br>
Xian- Is there any way to link this up to the original post on the S-list? Or move it into it? There is no reason for there to be two separate threads for it. <br>

Vindication/Nomaru/whatever you are.  there are a few drama queens on our server.  you take the cake.  why do you play this game for this kind of stress? seriously 'bro', just go read a comic or something.<br>
<br>
Xianle and her guild - i'm not sure i can leave this up.  cuz honestly, i can't wade through what's BS and what's not, and the rambling posts aren't helping =P the first post was very convincing, but now it's getting to a guild vs one person thing... can someone else contribute to this? someone else who was harrassed by nomaru?<br>

I talked to Inspiration for a while, over a period of about 2 days.  There's something not right about him.  I consciously made the effort to not talk to him anymore because I kind of thought he was creepy.  he didn't do anything really wrong, persay, except to barrage me with tells, and seem really... desperate and creepy.  My &quot;stalker&quot; alarm has never gone off so fast.<br>
<br>
Inspiration, I told it to you before... I really think you need professional help.  Hearing all these people talking, I'm even more concerned than before.<br>
<br>
[edit: i have _never_ read a post like Inspiration/Nomaru/Vindication's before.  if ever there has been a cry for attention, some symptoms of manic depressiveness, or possibly even schizofrenia, there it is.  inspiration, nomaru, whoever you are -- you really need to seek professional help.  this is _not_ a slam on you, this is for your own interests.] <p><TABLE WIDTH=475 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD><IMG SRC=http://kayleechen.homestead.com/files/fs_01.gif WIDTH=475 HEIGHT=14></tr></td><tr><td><IMG SRC=http://kayleechen.homestead.com/files/fs_02.jpg WIDTH=475 HEIGHT=102></tr></td><tr><td><IMG SRC=http://kayleechen.homestead.com/files/fs_03.gif WIDTH=475 HEIGHT=84></TD></TR></TABLE>

If you'll remember, you told me you were Nomaru a loooong time before I stopped replying to you.  It was the fact that you were creepy, not the fact that you were Nomaru.  It was the fact that my stalker alarm was going off 100%, faster than I've ever had it go off before.<br>
<br>
And, Nomaru, i am _not_ slamming you.  I am truly trying to help you here.  Take a look at what you said.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I could also post screenshots of people telling me how nice i am and etc. And that people love me....i'm not a bad person../sigh<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You mean to say you actually have screenshots of that stuff?

It's not something to be ashamed of, or something to feel that you have to hide from.  Go talk to your doctor.  Go talk to your psychiatrist.  It will help.<br>
<br>
I just see this, i see your posts, i've heard your many in-game cries for help (both from you and from friends)... you are in serious need of professional assistance, Nomaru.  For your own sake, don't be afraid to take it. <p><TABLE WIDTH=475 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD><IMG SRC=http://kayleechen.homestead.com/files/fs_01.gif WIDTH=475 HEIGHT=14></tr></td><tr><td><IMG SRC=http://kayleechen.homestead.com/files/fs_02.jpg WIDTH=475 HEIGHT=102></tr></td><tr><td><IMG SRC=http://kayleechen.homestead.com/files/fs_03.gif WIDTH=475 HEIGHT=84></TD></TR></TABLE>

<br>
Aside from that i think the fact that there are at least 4 or 5 claims up here by other girls about Nomaru is enough to keep it open. That and the screenshots of Nandanine asking in guild for help, her younger sister as well. <br>
<br>
Hopefully Nanda will post here and put the doubt out of your mind, Xian. I'm not posting here to flame Nomaru, i'm posting here because i'm tired of hearing my guildmembers asking for help because of him... <p><center><img src = http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/kissthis.gif></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=568.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=568.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=568.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=568.topic&start=81&stop=89>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showPrevMessage?topicID=568.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showNextMessage?topicID=568.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.emailToFriend?topicID=568.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.threadControl?topicID=568.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=568.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=568.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
