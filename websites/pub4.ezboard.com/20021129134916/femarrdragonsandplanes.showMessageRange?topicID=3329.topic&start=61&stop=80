ROFL.<br>

I honestly feel bad for the members.  There is nothing worse than seeing your guild die before your eyes.  <br>
<br>
As for Blame?......<br>
<br>
Iizzard is a 15 year old.  He saw that he could get away with lootwhoring and took the opportunity and abused the trust of his guild.  When Enan confronted him and forced the issue, Iizzard started cursing, name calling, and using d00d talk.......Talk about issues.  <br>
<br>
CD's officers, with the exception of Enan, trying to defend someone who immediately tried to sell an NBGed item, is down right HORRIBLE.  like i saw someone mention....If you can't trust your guild officers you're in the wrong guild....AMEN.  LET CD DIE.  I would be out of there SO fast.  <br>

You poasted publicly before you asked any other officers IG. You dont solo run the guild. Im sorry if you find fault in us not checking the boards daily but you handled this wrong, and continue to do so. And this is not realy even a soultion because if its sold already this wont work and if its not sold theres no fault on iizzard.  You should have talked to him and the other officers before taking the steps you did. I dont care if we dident see the poasts you should have sent me a tell IG to read em, or said something in the officers channel one of the dozens of times we were all in it between the time you found out there was a problem and the time you started the rant. You handled this verry badly which reflects badly upon the officers and the guild, whos intrest you should have at heart as an officer but clearly dont. This is not the only reason you were removed, but it did not help by any means.<br>

<br>
Me, you, and everyone else on the server wont know if Iizzard has truly quit, or ever will quit the game, that is his decision to make. In one of my other posts I said what could we do to him if he didn’t quit? Nothing. You can harass him to get the item back. In which case you will get warned by a GM not to harass other characters, you could get mad and follow him to each zone say look ma its the guy who sold a 100k toy that your guild got for him in which you would look more and more like the ass after people got tired of hearing you rant on. Or you could be really stupid and train him on every zone you ever saw him in. That brings us back to the banning issue. But feel free to do any and all of the above for us if you see Iizzard in game, as I know this is top priority for you.<br>
<br>
Not knowing for sure if Iizzard quit or not is the issue here but I am sure your concerns will be brought up and if he doesn't quit he will be removed if he hasn’t already removed himself. As for the not Enantiomer part, Enantiomer already burnt any chance he had to remain in the guild, from his name calling and accusations when people tried to explain to him what they thought was going on or how it was handled before he went off. <br>
<br>
As for removing Enantiomer from the only forum he could resolve this issue under…<br>
<br>
Did you take the time to read the links posted by Enatiomer to see how he was handling it?  Badgering everyone and anyone that stood against him. That was a great way to resolve things your right.<br>
<br>
As for my blow up to Thrasy, you would also have to be able to read the crap they posted about me on the guild board, they already accused me of secretly having a trade going behind everyone’s back, among other slants. When I saw the post I got pissed, I am sorry that Thrasy didn’t put a comma in the right place. It also could have gone the way I believed it to be with a “to” where the comma should have gone.  Not that it makes up for my misread on this one post…<br>
<br>
As for the posts on the other boards and from the web page I leave that up to you to decide if/when you take the time to look there, you seem intelligent enough to possibly wonder the same as I did, why don’t the just have a log of this? Who is actually talking to Iizzard and why is so much of the text missing? Cut paste and delete work wonders when you want people to think your story is true.<br>
<br>
Also while your looking at the post and or other parts of the board know that posts have been removed by the Administrator “Thrasy” of our old Ezboard and the Administrator of our old Web page “Enantiomer”, its really easy to make yourself look righteous with your finger on the delete key…<br>

A week ago enan was one of my best friends.. friend #1 lost.  Iizz quit.. friend #2 lost.. Az gone friend #3.. Thrasy gone, we werent ever friends but you were always nice and funny on guild chat, and now your gone. with iizz gone the gnome will probly be close behind, friend #4 lost..   over loot. which is total bullshit. I like everyone in the guild and its being torn apart because enan handled this wrong. I dont give a damn about the amulet or any other loot the only fun i have in the game is playing with ppl in the guild who i realy like.  If i wanted loot i wouldent have withdrawn my aplication from magister, there nice people from my experience but CD is my friends and thats more valuable to me than anything in everquest.  Oth put the poast up not iiz, i dont care how much enan twists iizzs words and poasts them out of context. This is a HUGE lack of comunication, ill admit this even on my part but it got outa hand and i had to do something. I might not have done it right.. im not perfect but i did the best i could. I will miss the friends i lost because of all this, it is just a game but the people i have met and friends i have made go far past it just being a game to me. Im done fighting i guess i cant fix it, but noone can say I dident try my best.. little as that may be.<br>

<br>
Please, read what I wrote on the guild boards.  I was making every effort to get you officers to work it out.  Instead, what do you do first thing?  Accuse Enantiomer and move to kick him out of the guild.  Wanna talk about no class?<br>
<br>
Beneg -- I have not, nor would I alter or change anything on the Chaotic Delusions Ezboard.  Don't even accuse me of that.  In fact I just made it so that the important pages are not editable so that people would mess with what has been posted.  Please enlighten me with what posts were deleted, I'd love to know so that I can get it fixed.  (RESTORE).<br>
<br>
You, Beneg, are a reflection of your words and actions.  I don't need administrative tools to show the truth or edit things in my favor.  I don't know how you conned the whole guild into thinking you are god's gift to the game, but you did it somehow.  So have fun playing officer man.  Too bad you had to screw a good guild to do it. <p>Thrasymachus Dawnwalker<hr>

He did.  Your effort to qualify that claim is rather transparent.  He offered a solution, and Iizzard ignored it.  Sure it is no longer a solution because Iizzard has now sold the item, but it was a solution back then.  He could return the cash to the guild treasury now, but he hasn't.  If it wasn't sold, there is only a lack of continuing blame on Iizzard if he doesn't now do the right thing.  He is still to blame for his past bad behaviour, regardless of how he might try and make amends now.<br>
<br>
So you are saying that Enan should have had the interests of the OFFICERS in mind, rather than the GUILD?  No wonder you guys are having a problem.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Beneg the Ridiculous:  You can try to do something, pinhead!  Your crap about being unable to do anything to Iizzard is just wrong.  Is he still an officer?  Is he still in the guild?  Has anyone made the first step in asking that he finally do the right thing, as attempted by Enantiomer?<br>
<br>
Nope, no top priority for me.  I doubt I'll be in game for a month or more, as I'm playing Wizardry 8 right now.  And then, I might go play Morrowind.  I'm simply entertained by irony and idiocy like I said, and you are providing some prime examples of both.<br>
<br>
Of course, Iizzard's potential quitting isn't the issue.  The same with your comments  I'm just hopping on your case because of your foolish comments about me not reading threads, followed by your misstatements of what others had posted.<br>
<br>
Yes, Enantiomer was quite heated in his response to the defense offered by Iizzard's friends.  I read it all.  And since he was getting heat from Iizzard and others, what the fvck is your point?  As he was giving what he was getting, how is it that only Enantiomer is to blame?  And why include everything in a threadlog, even if unrelated.  Isn't the thread still there?  If so, and it contains stuff that absolves Iizzard and company, why not open it to the public.  Seems a simple solution if there really is some malfeasance taking place.  And unless you have evidence of editting the logs, your accusations are mere bluster and foolishness. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubeneg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beneg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 12:34:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3329.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaotic Delusions, I didn't want to do this.../sigh</span><hr size=1> I never had to con anyone Thrasy. I do things for people when they ask me to I don’t hide in some dungeon somewhere and ignore people when they ask for help or a port and only invite my RL friends to come group with me. I don’t dodge or avoid raids then log on right after they finish, or go anon during them. I am there for any and all guild mates when I can be. As for you Thrasy, I don’t know you to well in fact the only time I ever grouped with you was on our raid to WW killing dragons, when I was playing my Paladin, but from that I felt you were the worst Druid I ever had the sorry pleasure of grouping with I almost died 3 or 4 times during that raid because you nuked at level 52 (resists) and didn’t heal me once, even though you were the only healer in the group I found myself either healing myself or dying...<br>
<br>
As for anything you have done for the guild I cant recall anything that I am aware of, Enantiomer and Aziline have done a lot for the guild but that along with the minuses for Enantiomer’s temper and misuse of power in the guild lead to his demise.<br>
<br>
Instead of continuing this thread why don’t you ask yourself what it’s going to help to keep bashing and slamming members/officers of the guild? Its not Thrasy get over it and move on the decisions have been made and wont change with your continual harassment in this flame. If you or Enantiomer wanted to make things right you would still be working on things with the guild not bitching in this forum. You just don’t want the guild to live because you feel hurt in some way, if everyone disbanded would this make you happy? Will it prove to you that you or Enantiomer had the power to destroy a guild over a piece of uber_loot_01? No matter what comes of this Thrasy know one thing your not part of the guild anymore and will never be again, so move on see if some other guild wants you to join them and not heal there tanks, maybe have rexfel get you another 5 levels while your gone from the game for a few months..<br>

Feel free to bash at me all you want.  It doesn't bother me one bit.  It also doesn't change the fact that you won't address the simple truth about this whole occurence.  I don't care about how much play time I've logged or who or what I've done.<br>
<br>
Truth be told, when I actually have time to play, I usually do spend my time porting people around or helping with transfers or chit-chatting with guild members.<br>
<br>
Iizzard screwed up and you guys blamed it on Enantiomer when he tried to fix it.<br>
<br>
Yet again you attempt to cloud the real issue with smoke and mirrors.  Bring it on Beneg.  This is a great example of your character. <p>Thrasymachus Dawnwalker<hr>

Good to see you guys still have drama on Emarr.<br>
<br>
From a fresh perspective, Enan was pushed into a corner by corrupt guild officers who wnated to coverup/protect their RL friend.<br>
<br>
The easiest proof to my statement is the fact that he no longer belongs to the guild due to being kicked out.<br>
<br>
If anyone stays in this guild, they are fools and slaves to a clique of RL friends who will benefit, possibly on ebay, from your hard work.<br>

I observed it was cut and paste.  What does that prove?  Bupkis.<br>
<br>
So Iizzard isn't culpable for his conduct or comments because he was &quot;goaded&quot; into making them?  That's intellectually dishonest anywhere but kindergarten.  Iizzard agreed he was selling the item (belieing Oth's comment that it was merely a PC).  Iizzard said that he &quot;might&quot; give &quot;some&quot; of the plat to guild treasury.  It now appears that he has sold the thing for 101K, and hasn't given anything to the guild.<br>
<br>
Please tell me what is honorable about his actions.  Unless you can demonstrate that there was something editted that demonstrates Iizzard's lack of culpability, you're just making excuses and sticking your head in the sand.<br>
<br>
The facts remain:<br>
<br>
1.  Iizzard obtained an item on a guild raid.<br>
2.  Others in the guild wanted the item to USE.<br>
3.  Iizzard sold the item.<br>
4.  Enantiomer tried to get Iizzard to return it or make amends.<br>
5.  Iizzard chose not to do so.<br>
6.  Enantiomer got pissed at this selfish conduct.<br>
7.  Enantiomer stated in an Officer Only Forum his frustration with Iizzard's actions.<br>
8.  Enantiomer's pleas were ignored.<br>
9.  Enantiomer brought it to the attention of the rest of the guild, after it was already known in the Item Bazaar.<br>
10.  Enantiomer was booted from the guild, as well as several of his supporters.<br>
<br>
How does Enan's decision to air this grievance to the guild after being ignored by other officers, and then to the general public after it was already well-known, absolve Iizzard of his malfeasance in the first instance? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 570<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/8/02 1:07:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3329.topic&index=79>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaotic Delusions, I didn't want to do this.../sigh</span><hr size=1> Did someone forget where Burnt Woods is this week?

Shifting blame for stuff that happened? How did anyone do that? Someone other then Enantiomer post bitchs about people of accuse them of protecting Iizzard? No Thrasy <br>
<br>
Enantiomer didn’t get a timely response so he brought it to the guild after he waited a whole day?<br>
<br>
It was in guild and people posted their feelings and or efforts to resolve the situation, but in response Enantiomer you or Aziline posted @#%$ talk and accusations.<br>
<br>
Enantiomer was removed after the officers consulted Tokum and made their Decision. <br>

Now for some reason Enantiomer and you didn’t get the results you wanted in guild and you think you may here. It’s a dead issue we are trying to work things out internally now. I am sorry you guys wont be around to see what comes of it but basically that’s your own fault isn’t it?<br>
