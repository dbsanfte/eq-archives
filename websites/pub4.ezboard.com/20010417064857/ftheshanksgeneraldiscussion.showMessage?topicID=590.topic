I quite like living there, because the darkies tend to control the zone, and they tend to be more competent PvPers than the newb trash in, say, Highpass.  Good exp when I want it, and some great fights, both solo and grouped with other Shanks/Combine.<br>
<br>
However, there is one great exception, and that is the horrible guild of bind rushing newbies known as Soul Takers.  I'll just give you a brief list of my encounters with them.<br>
<br>
1)  Started when I logged on.  I had camped a short ways off from the Paw zone line.  As you might know, a lot of people camp the gnoll spawns outside, and I thought I might either take a couple or find a group, or a victim.  So I walk around the spawns, most empty, then I finally find a group of dark elves (Soul Takers) engaged with a gnoll.  Quickly con their group, black necro, yellow mage, red mage.  The necro (can't remember the name) had apparently more or less been assigned healing duties.  <br>
<br>
So when the gnoll drops, out of hiding comes Xefin.  The necro was at 2/3 life trying to heal people.  Backstab, root poison, poke poke poke.  The only spell she got off was shadow step, and a few shuriken ended her feeble attempt to get away.  Of course, now I have two mage pets on me, and the fire nukes are raining down, so I book for Paw zone.  I make it with about a bubble and a half to spare.<br>
<br>
So I start bandaging up inside Paw, and get up to 3 bubbles quickly.  And just as I'm ready to go back out and see if maybe I can pull off a kill on one of the mages, what do I see?  A naked wizard, with the &lt;Soul Takers&gt; tag up logs in right in front of me.  Tempting as it was, I don't attack naked people.  Of course, I assume he had been sent to slay me, because he immediately casts see invis and proceeds to try to root me.  Of course, poke poke poke, and he runs through the zone.  On the other side, I find one of the mages from before camping the line (Uadvenau), and an oor high mage damage shielding both her and the naked wizard.<br>
<br>
So, the fight's on again.  I take it back into Paw, to avoid having the mage pet on me.  Eventually after both of us zoning several times, I kill Uadvenau on the SK side of the line.  I zone back into Paw to hopefully finish off the wizzie.  And what do I find?  Uadvenau, apparently she's bound just inside Paw.  <br>
<br>
So I ask her to scoot, and leave her alone while I chase the zone dancing wizard.  Leave her alone, that is, till she starts nuking me (which didn't take long).  No effort to loot her corpse whatsoever.  So the zone dancing begins again, as both she and the wizard try to pop in and nuke me and run away to get their damage shield on the other side.  After zoning back and forth probably 20 times, my computer decides it's had enough of zoning, and EQ boots me.<br>
<br>
I get back on, figuring I'm surely dead.  Apparently though, I either got lost in the zone line, or my linkdead arse did a suitable job of fighting.  Came back in about a sliver away from death, but apparently the Soul Takers had called off the chase.  <br>
<br>
So I head into the depths of Paw to bandage, and ask Uadvenau if she doesn't understand loot and scoot, and that what she did would surely be considered bind rushing.  At that point she informed me that she didn't have to loot and scoot, that she had no respect for trash guilds like the Shanks, and that bind rushing was completely acceptable.  Then, she claimed that killing the necro somehow caused her group exp loss.  She claimed she had someone pulling gnolls.  <br>
<br>
I don't believe this at all, firstly because her party was already fighting a gnoll, are they sending out the puller to get more?  Not bright, and not likely.  Secondly, I had walked past the spawns to get to her party.  No gnolls, and nobody pulling them.  The only thing I could see, is the mage pets aggroing something on the way back from chasing me into Paw that they couldn't handle.  But I take her obviously bullshit story at face value, and apologize for anyone losing exp, but explain that she still died a PvP death to me and should still scoot.  She won't, of course.  So I talk to her guild leader, Sopen.  He informs me that bind rushing is ok by him, and that he would do the same thing.  So I give up on killing Soul Takers for the day, since I apparently have to kill them all repeatedly.<br>
<br>
2)  Another day, another Soul Taker story.  Log in near aviaks.  Do a quick /w, and the zone is full of Soul Takers...but what's this, the mighty Fortis is here?  So I tell Fortis, man, you gotta help me eradicate this trash guild, and of course, noble Shank that he is, he helps out.  I find Sopen and a few friends camping Vhalen Nostrolo and the centaurs, so I sit there, poisoning my blades, biding my time till Fortis can meet me.  Sopen and his group takes off over the hill, but I wait, assuming they'll be back.  <br>
<br>
But I notice another scene on the horizon nearby, Uadvenau running in to loot a corpse of hers.  Of course, knowing what a sweetheart she is, I give her about 5 seconds to start running after she's done looting.  She didn't, and I start tearing into her.  I've got her to about 1/3 life, and Fortis makes his triumphant appearance and cuts her in half.  She whines that she had just been pked and I was corpse camping.  I told her, if she wants to hang around too long in my zone after looting her corpse, I'm gonna kill her all I like.  /ignore a_newb_00.<br>
<br>
So we hang out near Vhalen, and of course Sopen stumbles back in, full of rage, looking for me.  He finds me of course, and a level 34 mage of course thinks he can take my 27 rogue.  When Fortis pops out from behind a tree and smacks Sopen for about 150, I find it very amusing.  As Sopen feebly tries to avoid death at the hands of Fortis, I dance with Sopen's earth pet, and a Soul Taker rogue named Kollo.  Now, unlike the rest of the bunch, Kollo could fight.  He and the earth pet are winning easily (tough to beat another rogue when you can't move).  Fortis finishes Sopen, the pet vanishes, and I take the opportunity to disappear, nearly beaten.  <br>
<br>
I bandage up and inform Kollo that I'll be coming to take his soul.  I figure three bubbles is good enough to take an even rogue, and Kollo's a little bruised from our previous round.  I apply a little damage poison and charge back into battle.  I find Kollo waiting for me.  Luckily, I resist his root poison, and he doesn't resist my venom.  So we joust, and circle.  He fights well, but is certainly losing when my SBD procs, and the fight is more or less decided; now that he's mostly immobilized, it's a matter of time before I whittle his last bubble of life away.<br>
<br>
But wait, what's this?  Why, it's a naked Uadvenau, nuking me again!  Also on the scene is another Soul Taker, an enchanter dressed in human guise.  The dumbest enchanter I've ever seen too, since he never even tried a tash spell.  He just immediately tried to root me 20 times, and then tried to nuke me.  I think he did a total of zero damage.  But eventually, the tide is turned by the bind rushing newb (as my fire resist is terrible).  I'm losing, so I head for the hills and pull hp rings.  If I'm gonna lose to bind rushers, you can damn well bet they're not taking my 70 plat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
After that, I think Fortis beats the hell out of the enchanter and Uadvenau again.  I scoot, because Shanks, and all decent guilds, &lt;cough&gt;, always do.  Even in this case when the tactics that killed me were beyond dirty.  Of course, I immediately start getting tells from Sopen talking @#%$ about how Uadvenau took me down.  The great thing about Soul Takers, is you can count on them to talk trash when they LOSE!  It's so endearing, I want you all to experience it for yourselves.  I did talk to Kollo afterwards to congratulate him on his decent skill.  He said he might try to find a new guild.  Please, kid, if you're reading this, do it.<br>
<br>
3)  Another day.  I'm chasing a blue iksar monk out of aviaks.  I'm at about half life, and so is he.  He seems a little confused by the dark-elf mask I'm wearing.  He's scared to death, but running quickly.  He makes Lake Rathe line, and his computer zones much faster than mine.  He starts dancing.  After a few applications, he must have taken off into the rathe zone.  So I put root poison on, figuring if I see him, at least he won't take off again.  Do a /w to see if he's here.  He's here, but so is a Soul Taker.  <br>
<br>
Now the iksar is forgotten.  I guess the Soul Taker is camping aviaks at the arena, and I'm right.  I get there and there are 4 dark elves.  One's level 50ish, plvling help I guess.  I see my Soul Taker, a blue con necro named Vuiji(sp?), and two other darkies, conning blue and green.  So I charge right up to the Soul Taker.  Backstab for 100, and root him.  Fight is basically over at this point.  I did tell him to run, but he didn't listen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Beat the snot out of him, and the other blue con, a cleric, starts nuking me.  I zone into Arena to take stock of my situation.  <br>
<br>
The cleric follows, and begins with the nuke again.  I figure, nobody's looking, I can take her from 2 bubbles easily.  I lay into her, and after 1 round, I'm at under 1 bubble of life.  Yay, level 50 mage damage shield.  I say, screw that.  Zone into Rathe, then back to Arena, and hit the bandaids.  I go outside then, figuring it's time to get out of town.  Who's there?  Yep, you guys should be able to guess by now, it's the Soul Taker necro I just killed, who immediately sends a pet on me and tries to cling.  I take off, knowing there's no way I take that damage shield.  I get away easily, and then, of course, the necro and the cleric both start talking trash.<br>
<br>
So I get to the zone line to SK, and it seems there's a greeting party for me.  It's a red soul taker necro, Madlee, and some random ogre shammy.  I immediately set into Madlee since she's medding and not paying attention.  She's sowed, and because of it she evades a few swings, gets off a few lifetaps.  But I stick with her fairly well, and soon both she and I are at about 2 bubbles.  Of course, now is when the shaman gets into the act, sending cold nukes my way.  They don't hurt much, but I know I can't finish Madlee before he finishes me.  <br>
<br>
So I zone into SK.  I check behind me, and apparently they're letting me go, for the moment.  I hide behind a hill and bandage up, 3 bubbles again.  I do a /w, and find Madlee is in the zone.  I put on root poison; by this point I've decided I'm not going home without a dead red necro.  I come out from behind my hill, and there's Madlee, apparently looking for me.  She's in skeletal form, with a pet, looks frightening.  However, she's still hurting from the whooping I gave her in the Lake.  <br>
<br>
So I charge in.  Root poison sticks, and soon she's got nothing left to do but shadow step.  However, her pet gets a few key stuns, allowing her to step off and life tap, keeping her alive.  Eventually though, the pet whiffs a few times, my dirk procs again, and she's toast.  I ask her, hoping against hope, maybe, please, would you loot and scoot?  At this point, she says something to the effect of &quot;haha lamer, cannibalize killed me not you, so I don't have to scoot.&quot;  I guess the 600 damage I did to her didn't count.  I give up.<br>

Xefin, if you have a log, I'd be interested in reviewing it.  <br>
<br>
Everybody, if you are not autologging, its a good idea to do so.  There is a <br>
utility at www.eqcaster.com that can set it, and your text colors for you.  Also, a good screenshot says a thousand words.<br>
<br>
If theres one thing I came away from the faire with, its that a good reputation goes a long way.  Our advantage lies in that 1. We only have to tell the truth, <br>
2. We outclass our detractors in communication skills.  Might as well leverage them.<br>
