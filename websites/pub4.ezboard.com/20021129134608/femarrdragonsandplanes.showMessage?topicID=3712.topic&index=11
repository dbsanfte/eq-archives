They sent a certified leter to me, but it was returned somehow and i NeVER SIGNED FOR IT. The nazi's survived world war 2 by infultrating the DMV... I swear.<br>

the worst part is I am required to pay for insurence in CA. I am sure I would have it anyway, but I resent the state forcing me to give a private company my business and then give them the right to set the proce to whatever they want. Yeah yeah its supposed to be watched closly, but thats total BS. The state kicked my old company out of business in CA (it was thru a credit union) and now I have to pay nearly 2 times as much for the same coverage.<br>

did I mention I went to the DMV on monday and and they were lcosed when they were supposed to be open. The guy at the door said closed, but the sign hanging right in front of his damn face said they were open still. I went back the next day and after 2 hours was told I had to go get a smog check then wait on line again. Got my smog done and went back on wed., after 3 hours I got my damn registration tags.<br>
<br>
Why don't I just mail in my payment you ask? We'll last year i did just that and my tags never came in the mail. I called them and they didn't know what had happened. I went down there and they said I had to pay again. I called my bank and they had already cashed the check. I got a copy of it with the DMV seal on it saying CASHED. I went back tot he DMV and the supervisior said there was nothing eh could do, and they have to send my claim to the DMV in sacramento. In the mean time I get a regestration ticket because the parking guy failed to see my temp registration taped to the window. Some time later I get a note back from the DMV telling me I have to pay my registration and theres nothing they can do. I SHOWED THEM A CHECK THEY CASHED AND I HAD TO PAY AGAIN!.<br>

I was in an accident 6 weeks ago.  The other party wasn't insured [I'm in California too].  Although she had insurance when she registered her car, she cancelled it 5 weeks later [because of their lobbyists, the insurers aren't required to tell the DMV the insurance had been cancelled, even though they already tell any lienholders].<br>
<br>
Thankfully, I'm insured and pay extra to have uninsured motorist coverage to protect me from assholes like her.  It's part of the privilege of driving in CA.  Rather than forcing others to be responsible for you, we require you to do so.  No, we aren't idiots and are simply going to trust that you'll do the right thing.  Just like the cow that hit me, people will frequently cancel their insurance.  22% of drivers on the road aren't insured, even after the law requiring you to be insured.<br>
<br>
Lixivia:  Good to see ya ol' guildie [remember me from Sentries of Faith?].  Here's how insurance works:  50 people all agree to pay Allstate a certain amount of money.  Allstate then holds the groups' money aside in case one of them gets into an accident.  The amount that each of the 50 pay will be less than what it cost the one that got into the accident to get back to their original condition (car repairs, hospital bills, trips to Cancun, whatever).  <br>
<br>
Now the amount each of the 50 people pay will vary depending upon relevant statistics that determine the risks to Allstate that one of them will get into an accident.  Driving record, age, sex, residence, type of car, etc.  With the millions of drivers in the US and elsewhere, the insurance companies have pretty good ideas about what factors increase the risk of an incident.<br>

Careful Gurglespit. Laws exacted upon insurers are pretty much state specific in the US and widely vary between countries.<br>
<br>

It is buyer beware for the most part. Even if you the customer believes that everything is being explained to you it probably isn't. We don't usually find out until we have a claim that our rear ends are now raw.<br>

Hmm.. I am pretty sure that almost anytime you sign a contract here in the US (and an insurance agreement/application is a legally binding contract) the person presenting the contract is required to explain everything you don't understand and ask them to explain to you about that contract.. I may be mistaken.. it's happened once or twice.  <br>
<br>
In any case, you can also go down to the department of insurance (or whatever state department handles insurance regulation in your state.. they ALL have to regulate it) and ask for documentation or ask for places to get information on insurance.  Libraries are also a good place to look.  I make it a point to know as much as I can about anything that I give that amount of money to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Gurg V1.0</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeenmalikyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen MaliKyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/11/02 9:05:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3712.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: insurance</span><hr size=1> Gurg, you are correct about going to the Department of Insurance to get information.

<br>
You may be right about: <i>"...the person presenting the contract is required to explain everything you don't understand and ask them to explain to you about that contract..."</i>. <br>
<br>
It has been 10 years since I was an insurance agent and things probably have changed. When I was an agent we only where legally held to explaining what was <i>material</i> to a customer's question. In other words, the burden of proof that a customer didn't understand parts of the contract was upon the customer.<br>
<br>
Infact, that is where insurance companies can be really evil. Insurance companies have a signed contract where the customer acknowledges they understand the terms of the contract, but the insured really has no recourse if they have to prove that the Insurer's agent either misrepresented or omitted information in order to get a sale.<br>
<br>
I personally knew agents who would have customers sign life insurance contracts at the same time they were buying auto insurance and the customer didn't know they were getting life insurance! One of these people had called my office wanting an auto quote and they practically had a heart attack when the price was so much different. When I reviewed their portfolio with them they were aghast that they were sold a life insurance policy with no knowledge of what they had.<br>

I know that some agents can be pretty da<i></i>mn sneaky to say the least, not the majority of them... just a few really smelly bad apples.<br>

It's a good business practice to do so and usually avoids litigation down the line, but it's not required.  If you sign a contract, you are under an obligation to have read and understood it before you did so.  Even though some provisions may be difficult to understand, even by someone who reads lots of insurance policies like me, the insured is still deemed to have read and understood the policy when purchased.  You snooze, you lose.<br>

Now, that does not give the agent the right to mislead the consumer regarding the scope of coverage and other bullspit that is being ordered.  And many good insurers will have their own rules requiring full disclosure and explanation. <p>-- The <select><option>SOB</option><option>Grump</option><option>Bastard</option><option>pwner of Chiteng</option></select> formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugurglespitfruggybasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurglespit Fruggybasher</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://dyce.i8.com/gurblip.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1527<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/11/02 11:35:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3712.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: insurance</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I believe Lurikeen is right that there is no obligation to explain all of the provisions of an insurance policy to the prospective insured, at least in California.

I'm not saying that agents are required to tell every person about every aspect of thier policy.. I am saying that if the person asks a question about something they don't understand about thier policy or prospective policy, the agent is obligated to explain whatever you asked about.  If you don't ask about something, then don't expect to have it explained to you. Therefore, if you don't understand anything about your policy, then ask, and they should tell you. <p>Gurg V1.0</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1509<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/11/02 11:45:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3712.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: insurance</span><hr size=1> I agree. <p>-- The <select><option>SOB</option><option>Grump</option><option>Bastard</option><option>pwner of Chiteng</option></select> formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3712.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3712.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3712.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3712.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3712.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3712.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3712.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
