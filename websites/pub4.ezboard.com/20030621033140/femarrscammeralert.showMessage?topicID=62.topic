Geez!</span><hr size=1> I was sitting around in Faydark when I was approached by a level 1 druid, named Ozbillious.<br>
<br>
He starts sending me tells, asking me where I am, and when he finds me he inspects me about twenty times.  Then the usual lovely dialogue ensues.  He says he really needs my equipment for his new character.  He offers me 5k for my runed falchion (?!?), claiming that he'll pay me back with his level 55 necromancer, &quot;Zakk.&quot;<br>
<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:00:58 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'it is on Zakk my 55 necro'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:01:05 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'very respected '<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:01:11 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'you know him??'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:01:27 2001] You told Ozbillious, 'No, I don't.'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:01:40 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'what lvl are u?'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:01:42 2001] You told Ozbillious, 'If you bring the Necro here, I'll gladly trade with you.'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:02:41 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'I would really apriciate it if you could put it on this guy here'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:03:01 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'My 55 necro Zakk is very honorable'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:03:04 2001] You told Ozbillious, 'Sorry, I do a fair trade... money for item at the same time.'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:03:31 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'that wouldnt work because i need the sword on this guy'<br>
[Sat Jan 20 04:03:42 2001] Ozbillious tells you, 'I am trustworthy'<br>
<br>
/em rolls on the floor laughing at the lame scammer.<br>
<br>
I refrained from telling the guy where to go, figuring that public humiliation would be so much more fun.  He walked away empty-handed, and immediately camped out.  I do an /ooc and let the zone know what just went on, and get several tells from people who had been approached by him under different names.<br>
<br>
I ported over to WC, and not ten minutes later I run into a level 1 monk named Soltonya (er something) who was trying to talk an Ogre warrior out of his Lamentations.  This was in the North FP bank.  I sent the Ogre a tell and told him what the newbie had been up to all night, and we had a good laugh embarassing the little bastage.<br>
<br>
Do people actually get scammed this way?  Does this actually WORK?  Anyway, if you are approached by some little level 1 who wants your gear, laugh in his face and tell him Verdana sends her regards...<br>

I finally got my petition answered at about five thirty, but by then everything was over and done with.  Hopefully they will be able to catch him.<br>
<br>
I can see how a new player, or someone unfamiliar with these kinds of scams, might be easily caught up in this trap.  I would hate to hear that this had happened to my younger sibs, who wouldn't know better...<br>

Geez!</span><hr size=1> Heres the thing. Check out all these boards and have a look how many times the EXACT scam is pulled over and over again.<br>
<br>
Look at the fungal tunic that ends up in everyones trade window in EC. All I have to do is go into EC and auction something of value for someone to offer me something. Do people fall for the the 5ks on my other character? Yes.<br>
<br>
So yes its bound to work. Why? Let me explain. I trade items. I buy cheaply because I pay atttention to prices and I sell that item for more than I paid. Now some guy will tell me &quot;but its only worth 500pp&quot; I know what he means is that its only worth 500pp to him. If I hild on long enough someone will come into the zone looking to buy something and Ill be there. I'll sell my item for a nice profit. If your prepared to hang on you can make a fortune. People do this every day in real life. <br>
<br>
So you put that fungi tunic in a window 100 times and at least 1 person is going to fall for it. You may have to try the &quot;but its on my other character&quot; trick 200 times and someone is going to fall for it once. Maybe its a younger player, maybe its someone who is too trusting. Maybe its someone who thinks that theyve heard the well respected name before.<br>
<br>
So as for being creative. Why? Baiting and switching is far more creative than asking if someone will trust you and give you the item and you'll pay them later but it has entirely more risk. If you bait and switch you havent got long before someone petitions you. If you offer money from a higher level character you can always get away on the basis that you may intend to pay for it. All you have to do is make sure that you can pay for it if anything goes wrong and the GMs get involved.<br>
<br>
Heres a better one. Start a character called Verdaana or Keryn. People know the names, theyve seen us on the boards, they know we can pay for an item like this. So if someone goes up to someone and calls themselves by a similar sounding name then they can pretend to be our twinks.<br>
<br>
Eventually it will work. It only has to work once and that newbie has enough cash to outfit themselves completely. Only 1 dragonborne sash has to be given for that cloth shirt and some mid level guy (cos thats usually who they are) has a decent item.<br>
<br>
So now some people are thinking Kerryns a scammer cos he knows all the tricks. Know the nature of the beast before you attempt to kill it.<br>
<br>
The biggest protection you can offer yourselves like this is to only trade for an item in trade. Even with people yove known forever. So Zakk can give Verdaana the money and then have a friend swap it for him.<br>
<br>
Whats the next step. Let everyone know who your twinks are. If anyone comes up to you and says Im Kerryn can you lend me this and Ill pay you back later know this. I have two twinks. Rylan (level 5 druid)and Nottin (level 1 necro). If Keryn asks you for an item. ITS NOT ME!!!!<br>
<br>
You can petition it all you like but were past the days when this worked on a single account. People buy accounts for this purpose. You get one account banned and they'll buy another. You can have their IP address banned but people will use alternative dial ups. They can ban peoples home addresses but they'll ask a relative to use their address. You can ban a credit card but who couldnt ask a friend if they could borrow theirs.<br>
<br>
Their is no protection in the long run. So Verant can trace that item but what happens if Ozbillious trades that Runed Falchion for 800pp and gives the 800pp to the twink. You cant trace the falchioon any where else but to someone who bought it legitamately.<br>
<br>
The only thing you can do is cover yourself any way you can.<br>
<br>
And remember a runed falchion for 5kpp? If it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck somebody somewhere is going to have to accept the remote possibility that it is in fact, a duck.<br>

Geez!</span><hr size=1> Kerryn's exactly right, all it takes is one trusting person, and the scammer scores.  And that person't faith in humanity is forever affected, and that's the true loss, sigh.<br>
<br>
And believe me, there are a lot of very trusting people out there.  I can't begin to tell you how many times people have asked me to transfer stuff for them when I'm at the bank.  Yes, I'm level 53 and probably don't need the stuff they are trading (which is still some decent equipment).  Yes, I'm a member of a well known guild.  But still!!  If I have the time, I help them move the stuff around, but will usually have a little fun with them first, like (after I have the stuff and they've logged their other char on) &quot;Do I know you?&quot; and &quot;What stuff?&quot;  LOL.  I'm actually trying to kinda gently show them what *could* happen.  We always have a big laugh and lotsa fun, and I end up with a new friend.  But geez....it's just not something I would ever do, and it fascinates me to see how trusting some people can be.<br>
<br>
And yes, I do know that it's another form of scamming to give someone an item, then claim (shouts, OOC's, etc.) that they never gave it back or gave you something different.  I guess I'll take that risk *shrugs* <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showPrevMessage?topicID=62.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showNextMessage?topicID=62.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.emailToFriend?topicID=62.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.threadControl?topicID=62.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=62.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to receive email notification of replies</a><br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=62.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a><br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert>Scammer Alert</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
