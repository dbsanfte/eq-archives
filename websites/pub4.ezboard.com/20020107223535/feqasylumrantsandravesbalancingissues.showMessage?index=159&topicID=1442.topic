BATTLE OF THE GUILDS (View or Add Comments)<br>
Hello Fellow Adventurers! I am proud to announce that the 2 biggest guilds on Lanys T'Val, Soul Assassins and Riders Of The Apocalypse, are going to have a joint event on the 31st of October. <br>
<br>
To celebrate this most Evil holiday, both our guilds will get 10 of their strongest members to duke it out in The Arena, to claim guild supremecy of the Server. Spectators can bet on the outcome of the battles, and various prizes from our many Plane raids and zone raids will be handed out to a few lucky spectators. <br>
<br>
Be there, and bring the beer!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It must get very dizzying seeing as how everything revolves around you and your plans.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Gtath. I, and my guild, respect other people. We stop and think about how something we are about to do might affect them. We consider how they might feel if they were doing the same thing to us.<br>
<br>
You claim that everything revolves around us and our plans, or my plans, however you decide to look at that statement, yet it was you and Visions that chose to take out all 4 warders at once, effectively eliminating 4 dragons from the game. The 4th warder is a tough kill. But the 4th warder can be killed without killing the other 3 warders. So this was clearly a decision by Visions as a whole, since it took 50+ of you to accomplish it, to screw Fallen Legacy more than anyone else, since we had just managed to start getting 2 groups into sleepers a week ago. I have seen repeated statements about how this has been planned for months and months, but its sure funny how with all those plans, as soon as you guys see FL in there, you suddenly manage to get the manpower to do this. Then you guys have the balls to patronize us with crap like &quot;Its easier to farm primal now. You should be happy!&quot;. FL has worked its ass off in the couple of months we have been together to reach the goals we have reached. We have not asked anyone to make anything easy for us. Half the fun of this game is learning how to kill shit.<br>
<br>
Also unlike you and Visions, we have managed to get CT by either waiting until the guild that scheduled Fear that day was was done and leaving, or by coming in hours and hours after they started with the raid leaders permission, and helping clear what was left. Yes, this has meant that there have been times when some of our members have still been awake it was time for them to go to work due to us getting to CT very, very late, and on at least one occasion, we postponing killing CT for a day because it was so late and too many mobs remained up when the other guild left. But we have refused to walk over other people to get to CT, and I am proud of my guild for that.<br>
<br>
How you guys treat other people was the main reason I refused to join Visions when I was asked to join. You guys were going into Fear shortly after patches and clearing the zone, screwing a raid a week or more just to get to CT at your convience. Now you have decided to permanently eliminate mobs from the game within a week or two of the time another guild would have been able to maybe kill one of them.<br>
<br>
Another reason I refused to join was that I wanted to experience learning how to kill the mobs. Joining Visions would have been like getting on a train and watching it steam roll over everything in its path. It would have been like playing a game and using cheat codes to activate god mode, which to me is fun for a few days, and then you realize that all the fun is gone because you know there is no challenge to anything anymore, and you quit playing. You guys already had virtually everything in Velious figured out, so what fun was there for someone new to enjoy learning how to kill shit. No thanks.<br>
<br>
I can say that had our roles been reversed, you and your guild would have been farming warders for the next few months. You would have had the opportunity to not only farm them, but to have had the enjoyment that comes with successfully learning how to kill another series of dragons. At some point, we probably would drop all 4 warders, but we would not have done to you what you have done to us.<br>
<br>
So its not me and my world that things evolve around. Its you and Visions that make things evolve around you. You guys have no respect for anyone else, yet you demand respect from us. You will get none from me since your actions clearly speak louder than your hollow words.<br>

HPs are sent as a %, same with mana and stamina.<br>
<br>
Before SoV HPs were stored in 16bit signed integer which can hold values ranging approx -32,000 to +32,000.  That is why pre-SoV mobs have 32,000HP or less.  With SoV the type of the variables was changed to something higher ... the next highest being 32bit signed integers.  Those hold values from approx -2,140,000,000 to 2,140,000,000.  It's fairly safe to assume they did not use 64 bit or more since it would be useless.  It's also a safe bet to assume they gave the sleeper as many HPs as they could.  So HPs probably ~= 2.1 billion.<br>
<br>
Killing the mobs in ST / SS it looses a sliver of health so it's regen is not 2.1 bil.  VP dragons have an approx 5000 Hp / tick regen so it's not 8 bit (with a  max of 128 unsigned or 256 signed).  16 bit again is the most reasonable guess with a regen rate of probably ~32000Hp / tick  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Kirlen, I make no assumptions. I base everything I talk about on my experiences in-game. Its kind of like that guy in Iraq. He keeps screaming that everyone should trust him. Yet we know he is attempting to make biological weapons and nuclear weapons. But he insists that he isnt. Problem is, we have proven that he used biological weapons against his own people. <br>

<br>
Lets look at some facts, shall we?<br>
<br>
Several times in this post I have seen Visions members say that they never had enough people on that would stick it out to see the 4th Warder die in their previous attempts. I also have seen it said that their time in Sleepers on this fated day was around 3 hours. <br>
<br>
EVERY patch day Visions spends around 12 hours or more clearing North ToV. They do this with around 50 people.<br>
<br>
So......they could never get those 50 people to stick around for 3 hours to kill all of the Warders, yet they all seem to have no trouble sticking around for the 12 or more hours it takes to clear NToV. Interesting.<br>
<br>
Last week Fallen Legacy began making our first trips to Sleepers Tomb. Our first serious attempt at going there we had 12 people. We killed the Master of the Guard on our first attempt. Matter of fact, we absolutely owned him. Since then we have aquired several more keys and have made more progress into the tomb. We were getting close to having enough people there to attempt the first Warder.<br>
<br>
Visions KNEW we were getting close to having enough keys to try a Warder. They also KNEW that there was no way we were going to defeat all of the Warders, thus robbing them of their one time experience of awakening the sleeper. They KNEW they could wait, let us have the experience of killing a Warder or two, and still have their goal of being the guild to release the sleeper realized. Knowing this, they killed all four Warders. <br>
<br>
There are reasons Visions does the things they do. They start patch day in North ToV because they know if they don't, then they risk having Iki or Eashen killed by someone else. Someone else killing one of &quot;Visions mobs&quot; is a completely unacceptable thought. <br>
<br>
Visions killed all 4 Warders to avoid us killing any of them. They could have put forth the effort to kill Ventani at any time in the past 4 or 5 months that they have been having their run of the server, but they had other priorities. When the threat of someone else killing the Warders came to be, they immediately made it a priority to make sure that did not happen. They continued killing just THREE Warders, taking the loot off of the three and going their merry way, able to come back next week and kill all three again. Cooincidence??<br>
<br>
Visions had every right to release The Sleeper. They had the manpower and they had the tactics, even if it did take them 5 attempts. The thing that perplexes me though is why didn't they do it earlier? They say they never had the people or certain classes or what not to do it, yet every patch day we see them in North ToV with their obscene number of clerics and rogues and wizards having a grand time. <br>
<br>
Visions could have done this at any time. They CHOSE to do it now. For some members I have faith that that decision was made with the best of intentions. Others, however, I am sure knew exactly what they were doing and why they were doing it. I am sure the leadership of Visions did a great job of convincing the members that their intentions had nothing to do with Fallen Legacy beginning to kill mobs in the zone. I highly doubt, however, that every member of Visions went in to Sleepers without a thought in their mind about what the true reasons were. <br>
<br>
Anyway, what is done is done. Visions seems to think that they did FL a favor by killing the Warders and they also seem to think that now Primal will drop like candy. Don't lie to yourselves, you did noone a favor by doing this but yourselves. <br>
<br>
Also one last note. I notice one of you (Who shall remain nameless) preaching early on in this thread about how your reasons were true, etc. But......you chose not to participate in the Sleepers Tomb raid for your own reasons. Very interesting indeed. <p><b>Xantheus Diabolus</b></a><BR>

Doing a / all visions would bring up waay more IF people then CQ.  It was like that for quite awhile.  A few more people came back and joined I guess...  But the majority was still IF I think.  Now with the new people etc etc, it's really hard to differentiate.  Maybe at one time in the beginning Visions was CQ or IF, but they are most definitly their own guild now, and they have proven themselves.

As far as the warders go, it's definitly something I've wanted to see and do, and I am definitly sad that I won't get to now.<br>
<br>
However the way I see it is that it can't not be done (waking of the sleeper).  Someone has to do it, I just wasn't among those people.  They can't very well take the entire server on a tour of Sleepers to see the warders while the kill them. <p><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

Gal, you're like a god damned broken record. Been spewing shit about the local uber guild ever since I can remember, even back since Conquest. If you don't like the way things are, get your thumb out of your ass and do something about it. Just stop whining.<br>

*casts repel paranoia* Would a couple of the more vocal FL members care for a can or two of this? I've got large for $2.99 or extra large for $4.99. Twice the can for 2 bucks more! <p><P><p align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7258" target="_blank"><img src="http://elidrin.50megs.com/images/elidrinsig1.jpg" border="0"><P>

Sigh its sad seeing people assume they are the reason we released sleeper. Sorry but this was planned before your guild existed, do i need to repeat myself a third time?<br>

It will still be as unbelievable as all of your retirement posts.  <br>
<br>
<br>
With all the people who have shifted around between guilds why do you guys even bother with these pathetic posts saying you don't care what other guilds do.  I have friends in both guilds and know that each guild has people who do not like the other one at all.<br>
<br>
Every High level raiding guild makes plans and reacts to the other high level guilds on a server.  This not only goes for what Visions &quot;Races&quot; to but also what FL &quot;Races&quot; to.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is no doubt in my mind that the motive behind some of the Vision members for awakening the Sleeper was to make sure no one else did.  Not that I blame them because I'm also positive some of the FL members would do the same thing if the positions were reversed. <p><b>Qwade Starlifter</b><BR>
