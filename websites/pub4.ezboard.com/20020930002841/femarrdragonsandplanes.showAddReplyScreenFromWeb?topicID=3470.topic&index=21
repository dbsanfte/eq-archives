Political Reality: Inside Lags <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you are not the Economic Dictator of the U.S. (and, contrary to what many people think, neither is Alan Greenspan). So we have to make due with our current political system to enact our counter-cyclical policies. <br>
<br>
In order to combat a recession we need to go through several political and decision-making hoops. <br>
<br>
First we need to gather information on the economy and analyze it to the best of our ability. Both the Monetary policymakers (the Fed) and the fiscal policymakers (Congress and the President) each have a large number of economists who follow the economy and make recommendations. This is not an easy job and it can take a good amount of time (as in months) to fully measure and understand both how the ecnomy is currently doing as well as where it is likely to go in the future. I think the Fed has a slight advantage in this category given that it employs a large number of economists to do this and only this. (In the interest of full disclosure - I have worked at the fed and my loyalties may be affecting my judgement on this issue!) <br>
<br>
Second, once we learn that we are headed into a recession or a slowdown (or at least can make a forecast that convinces us of a looming slowdown), we then have to then make a decision as to what to do about it. Here too, the Fed has an advantage in terms of the speed in which it can move from analysis to implementation. The FOMC (the decision making body at the Fed) meets every 6 weeks or so, and can even act in between meetings as the fed did recently. <br>
<br>
On the other hand Fiscal policy requires an act of Congress and the President’s signature. This means debates, compromises, partisan fights, etc. By the time an appropriate fiscal response is enacted, the recession may very well be over. Anyone remember Clinton’s “stimulus package” proposal from 1992? The recession was over before the bill made it to the floor. Bush’s tax cut proposal is not even scheduled to be brought up until May - a full 4 months after the Fed’s first action on the economy. <br>
<br>
Finally, we have to wait for the implemented policies to have their ultimate effect on the private economy - the “outside lag” as mentioned above. On this point there is still a bit of debate as to how long it takes for policy to have its ultimate impact the economy. Most would put the main effect of a interest rate shift anywhere from 6 to 18 months after enactment. Fiscal policy probably takes longer. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Fiscal policy refers to the way in which the government exerts influence on the economy through its overall budgetary decisions. Budgetary actions that raise the growth of government expenditures, reduce the growth of revenues and either increase the deficit or reduce the surplus are the sort of fiscal policies that tend to stimulate short-term growth in the economy. Actions that trim expenditures, increase government revenues and shrink the deficit or increase the surplus tend to dampen short-term economic growth. The challenge of fiscal policy is to adopt actions that are right for the circumstances. This is not easy, because there are long and variable lags between government fiscal policy decisions and the resulting impact on the economy. Moreover, stimulative or restrictive policies can be self-defeating in the long run if they are applied persistently and indiscriminately. The government normally seeks to implement fiscal and monetary policies that together will foster steady economic growth while avoiding upward pressure on inflation.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What that says (in case you don't want to decypher the whole thing) is that intrest rate shifts take anywhere from 6 to 18 months to demonstrate their effect and that other fiscal political policies take longer.<br>
<br>
While it could be argued that the above is not a &quot;political&quot; statement, I would have to say it's pretty obvious that any governmental decision in a democratic state is *purely* motivated by political pressures.<br>

Enron was considered a model of how a corporation should be run, and all of the above three groups were willing to forgive an awful awful lot for those insane profit growth rates that many companies were reporting.  You want to toss in the Dot-com fad, and it all adds up to something that was a long long time in building.  Like, most of the 90s.  You could put a trained chimpanzee in the presidency and the economy would not tank as fast as it did in the last year or two.  It was a combination of factors.  You can argue, probably with a fair degree of legitimacy, that Bush Jr. has not done as much to fix the problem as could be hoped, but saying he or his administration caused it is frankly kinda dumb.  If you need &quot;a serious economist&quot; to tell point out the obvious fact that consequences are delayed from causes, and that in the case of the economy this delay can be quite a while... you need to pull your head out of your bum.  As far as this being for Merentha, email her if you don't want to get commented on, and don't play coy about the responses you got.  You were after them, and if you haven't caught on that seeing your name starting a thread guaranties at least a 2 page count of posters trying to smack down your latest bizarreness, then you are far less bright than you appear from your haiku's.<br>

No trying to fight a 'war' by looting a social fund is blatant partisanship.<br>
If you want to fight a war, you need to raise the taxes. There is no other way.<br>
<br>
The idea that whatever happens in the current economy can be blamed on the last admin is BS. No economist would go on record saying that. Political commentators<br>
and profit oriented business yes I suspect they will.<br>
<br>
The Prez could cause a world wide ressession just by saying on live TV<br>
'Nationalize all foreign assets' It would NOT take 2-3 years to manifest.<br>
THe effect would be profound and immediate. <br>

<br>
I too believe that an impact could be immediate as well depending on the type of statement or actions made. If Bush were to come on the TV and say &quot;ok Mexico. Remember all that money you have owed us since the beginning of time?&quot;&quot; well we are coming across the border and we are going to take it out of your asses.&quot; thanks Bye. That has not happened. Nor would it ever because he cannot act on his own or just speak out of his ass. Economic Policy is a group effort. Not just his. <br>
<br>
My questions to Chit is this. Who's responsibility was the 80's and the success we shared with the world then? if I remember correctly one of the hated Republicans was in office for the better part of that decade. Was it Carter? Was it any policy that he put in place? Doubtful. It was the group effort by a president that understood bi-partisan ship and worked hard at it to make it work.<br>
<br>
People like you Chit amaze me. Facts can be looked at from sides of the fence and will always be. You can tell me that W is the antichrist for all I care. The reason that the economy is failing has very little to do with W. When was the last time that the President walked down to Congress and said &quot;Screw you guys and your policy and rules.&quot; &quot;I am going to make this a law or act on my own.&quot; &quot; I do not need you&quot;. <br>
<br>
Lesson in American Politics 101. We have checks and balances and they keep people from acting on their own. The only truly single power the President has is he can call the Marines into action for 60 days without the consent of Congress. (I may be wrong on this. it has been a few years since I was in American Govt.) He cannot enact any laws or policies without a note from his parents...err Congress. <br>
<br>
So keep playa hating Choadmaster. Last time I checked the Democrats have been in power of both houses for quite some time. Talk to them. Their just as much to blame. They make the rules. George can Veto but they can over-rule that as well. <br>

Reagan was hardly bi-partisan. Congress vetoed his little anti-nicaragua thing<br>

The republicans held the office for 12 years before Clinton...I hate to tell you but SOME of the bad times had to be theirs.<br>

Again I didnt say, nor have I ever said its Shrubs fault. I am saying that it is happening while the Republicans hold the Whitehouse.
