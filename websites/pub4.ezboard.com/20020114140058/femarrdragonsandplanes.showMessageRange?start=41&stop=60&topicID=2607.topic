<br>
White Scale I think should go to them, Just like red should be warrior/bard<br>
<br>
Pre epics the white scale and the red scale could be made into 2 very nice peices of equipment, there are still a few of which floating round the server<br>
<br>
Post epic release quite a few things were made to be used in those quests, and no matter a persons chance at completing their epics they should be given that chance.<br>
<br>
Yeah sure you could make a nice cloak or Breastplate outa what drops, but if a peice of your epic would be used like that you would defend it for epic reasons.<br>
<br>
If that scale sits in the bank for 6 months before the person can use it so beit, thats the nature of epics and people trying to complete them in no or small guilds, let them try.<br>
<br>
And raid loot rules are decided by who leads them, if they are fair and people like them they will go again and again, if there crap and whorish, they wont, Torm/Vet/Sage had the best loot system I ever seen on a pickup, was very fair, with a slight disliking in the rules after I could only roll on a BP yet it was not counted in the other loot drops.<br>
<br>
But on the Wis/Int caster thing, if your gonna allow something like that to one of those, you should allow it to the other, thats fair, but personally I dont think either should get. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/31/01 5:12:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/eqdragonsoffate/images/calvin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG is dumb !!</span><hr size=1> <font color=yellow>Jex, your prima donna act is pathetic. You don't care what anyone thinks, and you're going to do whatever you want, but you still manage to find the time to write novel length posts defending yourself. People will kiss your butt for now, but as soon as the next dragon raid leader comes along, you'll be old news.</font><br>
<br>
Yes God... oh forgive me mighty king.  Thou art so much better than me.  <br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Jex, now I'm really curious .. do you ever post anything that isn't a mile long in content?! Lordy, get your point across in a few brief paragraphs. I got sick of reading halfway through because you're repeating the same thing.</font><br>
<br>
No matter what point I make you're going to find some way to pick at it to make me wrong... so what does it matter how long or lengthy my posts are?  It just gives you and your friends more to bitch about, and obviously you guys have nothing better to do then come down on me for something that shouldnt matter at all to any of you.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>you're posting them on a public message board and if someone doesn't like what you say .. guess what sweetums .. they're going to call you on it. </font><br>
<br>
As if I dont know this?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow><br>
he knows this game and he has done a TON of raid leading himself, so he's not talking out of his ass. </font><br>
<br>
Once again Im sooooo impressed!<br>
<br>
And on top of it all... why not give me your proposed loot rules and why you think they're so great... c'mon you MUST have the PERFECT solution right?  You guys ARE sooo experienced and noble, really let me see what your exact rules would be.  Rather than bickering and trying to point out that Im a piece of shit try to be a part of the solution rather than just making it a drawn out bitch fest that will prove nothing.  <br>
<br>
And I still dont understand why (considering I used the same loot rules that were used from the 9 or so raids posted be for mine) Vet had to come and blow up about mine?  Seriously, what made me so special and deserving of all of your Godlike opinions and not the guy who was leading the Vox raids for weeks before me?<br>

Vet didn't blow up on you.  You blew up on him.  Vet didn't start a flame thread with your name in the title.  You started a flame thread with his name in the title.  If you can't take some criticism, you had better give up leading raids now, because you're in for a lot of misery.  Your posts drip with insecurity and immaturity.<br>
<br>
How should you handle the loot rules on a Vox raid?  There have been long threads on this board on that very topic.  There are three ways to do it, each of which has its defenders and critics.  You can give priority on the dragonscales to the bards, who need it for their epic.  You can give priority on the dragonscales to bards *and* casters, because the casters can use the scales for the cloak quest.  Or you can make it a wide open random.<br>
<br>
If I was making the decision, I'd probably give the bards priority.  I think epics should come first.  Desbarolis used to advocate that view on this board, but most raid leaders tend not to follow that option.  (I think it was Des, anyway, but it's been awhile.)  Vet made some pretty good arguments for a wide open random among all casters.  Frankly, he has a pretty good point about how wis casters can use the cloak, too.  If I played a shaman, I'd sure like to have a cloak with those stats.  You've never come up with much of an explanation for why it makes sense to let only bards and int casters roll.<br>
<br>
So you want to do it a different way?  That's fine.  You want to disagree with Vet?  That's fine, too.  As it happens, I also disagree with him, though for different reasons than you.  I'd give the scales to the bards before letting anyone else roll on them.<br>
<br>
The problem is that, instead of listening to Vet and responding to what he had to say, you went into a juvenile hissy fit.  You called him a &quot;a greedy loot monger&quot; and an &quot;assbucket.&quot;  Then you dragged the argument over here, making a direct attack on Vet.<br>
<br>
And now you make this comment, begging for sympathy as a poor martyr being picked on by message board bullies:<br>

<br>
Well, dumbfuck, that's pretty much what Vet tried to do.  He told you what the problem was and made a pretty good argument for his solution.  Who started the drawn-out bitch fest?  You did.  Your response to his post was to call him a &quot;greedy loot monger&quot; and an &quot;assbucket.&quot;  Then you dragged the whole thing over here.  Try accepting some responsibilty for a change.<br>
<br>
But of course a prima donna like you would never stoop to accepting responsibility. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/31/01 7:05:42 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/eqdragonsoffate/images/calvin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG is dumb !!</span><hr size=1> As pathetic as I am, God, I see nothing I need to take responsibility for.  If you're refering to the bickering, hell yeah, I started it HERE on this thread, but go back and read Vet's post... and perhaps you're a bit more mistaken than you want to realize.<br>
<br>
For one he wasnt at all "just posting a suggestion or an opinion" he posted his views but he did also throw in some insults to start it off...<br>
<br>
Example 1:  <font color=yellow>you must be some poor country bumpkin that likes to watch the paint dry on a saturday night </font><br>
(directed to those people who actually ENJOY raiding the dragon regardless of the drops) it didnt necessarily insult me, but it was an attack, imho.<br>
<br>
But what pissed me off is that instead of just posting his views and objectives he threw in the following...<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>So until i am able to roll on the scale, i will never sign up for these damn raids, <b>and i urge all you other casters to do the same.</b> No casters, and the raid is not gonna happen.Back in the day ,the standard was for all casters to roll on the scale..that was the way it had always has been. It has only changed in the last six months or so, so don't believe that it has always been bard only crap.</font><br>
<br>
He had NO business going there, him trying to "corrupt" the raid that was being planned was bullshit.  He's entitled to his opinion but, realize, when he added that part he went overboard.  Perhaps my calling him an "assbucket" was a bit juvenile but seriously, I see nothing wrong with taking offense to the fact that someone was trying to fuck up my plans.<br>
<br>
Now, Sagemon the almighty, you're a real winner in my eyes.  And I can see why you're so "respected" in the EQ community.  But, seriously, you're insults and attacks seriously dont make me believe that you arent just as pathetic and juvenile as you claim I am.<br>

Vet didn't call you or anyone else a &quot;poor country bumpkin.&quot;  He was responding to some comments in the argument about the loot rules in the thread on D&amp;P (an argument that was started by int casters who were lobbying you to let them roll on the dragonscale).  What he said was:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And as for peeps goin just to see a dragon die, and the raid being exciting....that is total bullshit. I have been on these raids, and they are boring as all hell. ya sit in a buff room for an hour, sit in a chat room for an hour, then kill the damn dragon in 2 minutes.How is that exciting, you must be some poor country bumpkin that likes to watch the paint dry on a saturday night if it is.The ONLY reason peeps kill this damn dragon is for the LOOT! If there was no good loot, no one would bother to kill the damn thing.....I would love to see ya argue that point.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Like Vet, I'd love to see you try to argue that point.  Of course, you're just dumb enough to try.<br>
<br>
Your second example of an &quot;insult&quot; is Vet's call for a boycott of Vox raids until the loot rules are changed.  That's not an insult, no matter how much it may have pissed you off.  The insults came in your response:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> *laugh* hey, just because you're a greedy loot monger doesnt mean everyone else is... <br>
<br>
Lead your own damn raid, set your own damn loot rules, stfu, and ead... no reason for assbuckets like you to come along and try to start shit and piss a fit just because you dont agree to the loot rules. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A couple posts later, you tossed in some more pearls of wisdom that just show what a tool you are:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> you think you're so damn cool because you can lead a plane raid well yeah you're cool... I am making you my idol... whoopty do... anyone can do a plane raid if they've seen it done right once... just like a dragon raid.<br>
<br>
and the reason I didnt jump on the other casters who posted is because I know them and respect them... they're not just some random idiots who decided to come and give me a hard time...<br>
<br>
so... go jump off a cliff... you had no business posting here if all you were going to do was harrass me over what my loot rules were.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
After another post or two, you came running to this board, looking for sympathy.  All you've managed to do is expose yourself as an insecure prima donna.<br>
<br>

Jex, you have *yet* to answer the question asked by several people, however you sure know how to ramble in order to avoid it.  Here, I'll give it to you again slowly so you can understand the question ... no one has ANY way of knowing what will drop and since you're trying to spread out the drops, why are you allowing INT casters to random on an item that is equally important to WIS casters?  If nothing drops for the WIS casters are they out of luck?  What if that scale is the ONLY damn thing to drop off that dragon .. then what?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And I still dont understand why (considering I used the same loot rules that were used from the 9 or so raids <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Baaaaahh .. sheep.  Just because they were the loot rules on 9 raids doesn't make them one, set in stone and two, correct.<br>
Wahhhh so you were the one who got the post on the opinion about it .. big fucking hairy deal, go cry in the corner if you can't take some criticism.  What happens if you get a failed raid and people start complaining because their rez timers expire .. are you going to be able to handle the stress and criticism there?  We've seen plenty of threads where some newbie dragon raider got pissed about a CR and came to these boards to bitch about the raid leader.  You need tough skin chickadeee. <p>Tormentcia

<br>
<font color=yellow>If nothing drops for the WIS casters are they out of luck? </font><br>
<br>
FOR GOD'S SAKE YES!<br>
<br>
Like I said before... my second run with Vox NOTHING dropped for casters... what should I have done?  Let the druids roll on the RBB?  NO!  NOT EVERYONE WILL WIN!  Thats why the "Loot Rules" are set up prior to the raid, everyone will know what they can or cannot roll on (if it drops) and if what they are coming for doesnt drop, then hey, it was better odds than not showing up at all.  Everyone goes home a winner if the dragon dies. <br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>What if that scale is the ONLY damn thing to drop off that dragon .. then what?</font><br>
<br>
Then all the people go home knowing that some lucky bard is one step closer to thier epic...<br>

From meeting her and hanging out, and signing up and participating for part of her first raid, I can assure you she does not have a &quot;prima donna complex&quot; or anything of the sort.  My take on Jexi is that she's a basically good person with a low tolerance for BS.  I have never met Sagemon and Co. in game, nor have I been reading this board long enough to have a preconcieved opinion on any of them, but it seems to me that the haughtiness in this thread is primarily concentrated with them.  As far as dragon farming goes, part of what I liked so much about the raid she organized was that it was led by someone who genuinely looked forward to the challenge of taking on Vox.  Not the loot, the challenge.  Its a shame that some can't view a raid in this context, but its not something that really surprises me either.<br>

hmm.. I have killed naggy and vox a total of probably 30 times easily.. and only rolled on 5 items.. 2 CoF, 2 RBB, and one GoFM (no monks on the raid) and won the GOFM.. you go in knowing you won't win.. probably won't even get to roll.. but you will have fun downing one of the meanest mobs in the game (well.. so that part isn't so true anymore.. but it used to be when I was there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <br>
<br>
so 30 raids.. 5 rolls.. should i have gotten to roll on all those eyepatches (saw 3 drop off one vox...) and bladestoppers?? naw.. there are others who can use them better than I could.. they should get them <p><img src=http://dyce.i8.com/gurglespit2.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usagemonprayeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sagemon Prayeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/2/01 7:26:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Character Reference Inc, post flames below!</span><hr size=1> Predictably, Jex just flashed a lot of attitude and didn't answer the question.

Torm, I don't think Jex has any answer for that question.  I think the truth is that the int casters are her pals, and they successfully lobbied her to get a roll on the dragonscale.  She's been avoiding that question ever since Vet's first post on D&amp;P.  After all, what's she going to say?  &quot;Because the int casters did a good job of kissing my butt&quot;? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/2/01 7:36:08 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/eqdragonsoffate/images/calvin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Character Reference Inc, post flames below!</span><hr size=1> Ok Sage, dipshit, let me explain it slowly...<br>
<br>
Bards get to roll on - scale, horn, bag<br>
Druids and Shamans get to roll on - patch, res stick, bag<br>
Clerics get to roll on - patch, cleric hammer, bag<br>
Int casters get to roll on - patch, scale, bag<br>
<br>
If I let the Druids, Shamans, Clerics (your wisdom casters incase you're too stupid to figure it out) roll on the scale, then they get to roll on 4 items rather than 3.<br>
<br>
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?<br>
<br>
and... while you're STILL trying to prove you're sooooo intelligent and superior let me try to explain something else to you...<br>
<br>
I did not ever state that what Vet said in his first post was NOT an insult, I just stated that it DIDNT INSULT ME... but I did state that it WAS AN ATTACK, IMO.  Meaning that it was in fact an insult, or an attempt at one, but it was not one that bothered me on a personal level.<br>
<br>
So yes... you're an idiot and you were called on it.<br>
