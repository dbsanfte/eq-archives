The Ramones were in fact the impetus that created Punk music as a movement because the Clash were greatly influenced by them and the Sex Pistols by the Clash. OF course there were other groups like the New York Dolls, Television and even The Modern Lovers who were founding fathers of the punk music scene.<br><br>Punk as a social movement was started with the Sex Pistols for the most part. The Sex Pistols were an invention of Malcolm McLaren. There were formed to mostly take advantage of a growing gneed for counterculture teens.  They were a commercial venture, their intent was to take advantage of this group of teens. This didn't make the teens stand for anything, it made them feel like they were part of a culture. They are no different today then they were in 1976-1977. <br>There has always been an anger and a voice in the movement, there will always be an anger and a voice in every movement. (Even the most conservative cultures have this anger and a voice). There will also be a pacifism and a general ignorance in every movement. If in fact there isn't, then there isn't a culture, only a cult. Of those clowns that dress up and act like a punker, some of them will start developing an ideology from being absorbed into that culture, some of them will not develop any ideology at all. This has nothing to do with the movement, it has everything to do with the person and their surroundings.  If they choose to begin indoctrinations into a culture or counterculture then the least one can do is to allow them to follow the path of where they are going. There are a great many important people that went into a culture with no plans and came out of it much greater then when they went in.  I will name just a couple as the list is far too extensive to type. Buddha, Thomas Jefferson,  Jack Kerouac, Claude Monet, the list goes on and on across all fields and spectrums of society. Rather then argue that someone hasn't a clue with what they are doing, why not foster their abilities to grow from this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uxargylex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xargylex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 8:34:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3677.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The Ramones were in fact the impetus that created Punk music as a movement <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>The Ramones billed themselves as a surf band. <p><font face=ariel size="2"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59589">Xargylex Dreamchaser</a><br>58th Beguiler of Tunare<br>Anlah'Shok</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4609<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 8:39:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3677.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well...</span><hr size=1> Y'all still placing labels on yourself and having a debate about punk?

When you try to fit in as a punker then you are actually a poser.  However there is a caveat, Punk was intended as a counterculture not as a culture. Countercultures can evolve to become cultures. To expect someone today to fit into the counterculture of 1977 isn't possible because that counterculture doesn't exist anymore; it has evolved into a culture. Therefore for someone to join the punk culture today is no longer hypocritical as they aren't joining the counterculture of 25 years ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 786<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 9:41:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3677.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well...</span><hr size=1> There is no Punk culture today. <br><br>Simply because as a culture they deny they are trying to be a culture.
