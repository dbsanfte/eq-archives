If I had to guess, just based on what i have read here, I'd guess that you are a young person who was in the wrong but didn't know how to express himself with an apology (I could be way off).  Look back at the few posts you have made.  You say you did what you did because you didn't want &quot;to group with you assholes again&quot;.  Fine, there's a reason.  Now, you say &quot;when I did what I did I was just messing around with some people I don't even know&quot;.  Do you not see the contradiction?<br>
<br>
I am trying to be objective here, but you just don't seem to get it.  I made a joke about you on this thread and once you came out and said lighten up, I apologized because I really wasn't trying to offend you.  I don't doubt that it is never fun to be on the wrong end of a shit list/flame/whatever.  Hopefully, we can all see that even something that may be insignificant to you (death fist belts, fire beetle eyes, cloak of flames) can have an impact on those around us.  I am not trying to flame you (although you welcomed it with open arms on your first post), I am just trying to open your eyes a little more.  When you say &quot;when I did what I did I was just messing around with some people I don't even know and didn't consider the consequences&quot; that IS infantile, simple as that.  Children do things without knowing or worrying about the consequences.<br>
<br>
Take a second and put yourself in Delphi's shoes.  You are killing Treants in SK.  Someone doesn't go along with the group policies and decides to bring in their level 60 main and take over the camp &quot;so I didnt have to group with you assholes again&quot;  Wouldn't that make you a little upset?  I'm not saying that this is what happened, but hopefully, you get my point.  <br>

I am Dogmaul of the 'Warlords of Anarchy'. I would first like to extend my apologies to all the parties envolved. Treaks is one of our newer guild members. I would like to state that Treaks is an 11 year old and my not have the normal look at the game as our more experienced players, truly his behavior was inapropriate and his situation will be addressed. <br>
<br>
If anyone has any other concerns, please allow me to be able to address the issue to restore Honor to our name.<br>

I saw a flame post calling people assholes and the like.  However, that is not my concern.  My main complaint was about Treaks.  Noxos showed up after the fact and just made the experience even more frustrating.  Obviously just trying to cause grief.  Hey, if that floats his boat whatever, I know I would never group with Noxos or his secondaries if I know it is him, and suggest that others don't.  From the sounds of it you are in for some grief if you do.<br>
<br>
As for Seven Dreams, as I said I would never judge a guild by one member and never had a problem with them.  Never met a 7D member actually, and I wasn't even present during the incident that delphi mentioned (although I sympathize) incriminating Noxos/Keenan.  7D will deal with it how they see fit.<br>
<br>
Nothing has been said about the rogue, Riktor, so either no one else has had problems with him or they don't come to this board.  I think he just tried to take advantage of the whole situation and stir up some shit too.  Again, in my experience I would avoid this one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dogmaul, thanks for your apology.  I hold nothing against your guild either.  However, I don't see his age as being an excuse.  If you were present in the zone I think you would reconsider his membership with your guild.  I am quite sure his secondary is named Weaks (same guild tag, typing style, and his actions were extrewmely similar, so I am guessing it is him).  I saw Weaks there a couple days after the original incident with Treaks and Weaks was doing pretty much the same thing, being a general pain in the ass.  If he stays with your guild i hope you can teach him how to play this game and treat others with respect.   All that being said I accept your apology, but don't expect me to group with him ever.  I just don't have the desire to put up with behavior like that, and I don't want to associate my name with problem players.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to both guilds for dealing with this whole situation.  It has been over a week since my original post about Treaks, and since no one else posted about him within that time, and the matter has been resolved maybe this message should be locked (that is if I understand the rules right).  I feel that the Noxos/Keenan issue may need a seperate thread if others feel like they wish to pursue it.   <br>
<br>
I want to rid myself of this whole situation.  I am not sorry I posted about it because I felt people should know about the troubles they may run into around those three.<br>
<br>
If anyone wants to discuss this further with me (in a civilized manner) send a tell to me in-game (Warnin or Rave) and we can talk about it if you wish.<br>
<br>
thanks all,<br>

This situation was brought to my attention in Warlords some time back. I was told that Faldy would be posting here to inform our intention to resolve this matter. This is to update all of you/ bring you up to speed/ catch you up on the old times/ bring it to the streets/ give you the 411/ huff-n-puff the right stuff on the matter involving Treaks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As it is today, we have addressed Treaks/ Reaks/ Streaks/ Weaks (and all other words that rhyme) and this matter. We do not tolerate KS'ers (no matter the age of the RL individual), and being that he had no defense for his actions, it seems that he was not remorseful for what he did at all.<br>
<br>
I apologize for both the delay in our postings here and any annoyances that the lad caused you. Many of us are serious addicts of EQ, playing till the wee hours of the morning (of our third straight day with no sleep) and need counseling. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I too fell victim to our beloved hero of verbal battery even as a guild member, and it is clear to me that he does not yet understand patience and etiquette (Or it has yet to be beaten into him by his elders). Hehe<br>

If you group with said rhyme master, please practice your greatest amount of patience possible... <br>

That was for being a total *** at orc hill, begging and kill stealing etc, he was level 11 I think. Then I was handing sows and buffs around the newbie zone, then he came and whiped out eveything saying he needs to get ready to go to crushbone. The newbie zone must of poped about 3 times before any real newbies could get some exp. I think he is very imuture, hopfuly he will grow up a bit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalen</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/19/01 1:25:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Treaks</span><hr size=1> Um, where was that appology?  Somehow I sure missed it.  I did see an &quot;I don't really care&quot; type of attitude expressed by Keenan in his first reply, the one before he talked about an appology and a peace offering that I somehow missed.  /shrug.  Guess that is why people are still commenting.  Later he said he was &quot;just fooling around.&quot;<br>

I had a run in with someone tonight and was going topost that is why I am here, I am suprised to see this post still active.<br>
<br>
However, I decided not to post because I don't want to bother dealing with something like this again.  I honestly really don't care if there is an apology because well, I know it don't mean squat.  I am kinda sorry I even posted here.<br>
<br>
I think this forum could be closed, if it were based on my original post.  Unless he is continuing to pull his shit then I guess it should stay open.  Oh well.<br>

be well,<br>
