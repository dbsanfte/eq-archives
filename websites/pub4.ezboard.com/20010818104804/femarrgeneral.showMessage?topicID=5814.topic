'sides, i don't like going to rants and flames, too much hatred going on there ;p<br>
<br>
Anyway, so i go on this pickup nagafen raid.  No offense to those running it, but it was kinda unorganized.  A lot of people sent tells to me complaining about this.  Now, personally I've tried running my own pickup raids before, and that is the reason I've sworn it off.  I hate trying to round up people, I hate trying to get them to listen, I hate trying to get them to stop their damn bitching, I hate having to explain the same simple rules (ie., when doing vox, don't push giants into the wall) over, and over, every single raid, and having people ignore them.<br>
<br>
In essence, I hate leading pickup raids, because of the general stupidity apparent in groups of people.  You know how when you get a group of people together, the larger the group, the lower the average intelligence becomes?  It doesn't matter how smart everyone is.  You could have 5,000 genius' all standing around, and I guaruntee if you tell them all to do something, they'll fuck it up.<br>
<br>
Alright, so, I get on this raid, and I speak to one of the people in charge.  I asked if they could use me (they had no bards there), and this person said yes.  I then said that if I'm not allowed on cloak of flames, since it's the only item i can really use that i'd be allowed on, that they would need to find another bard.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't think it was rude of me to make this stipulation.  First of all, a bard is on an even keel, if not in some situations better off than paladins, and perhaps one or two other melee classes, all of whom are allowed to roll on dragon haste items.<br>
<br>
For those who aren't aware, dragon haste items have been restricted to all melee except bard, at least as long as I've been raiding dragons, and probably a lot longer.<br>
<br>
However, I've always felt, as have a lot of bards, that this rule was pretty lame.  I've been allowed on cloak of flames before, and before I got my epic, I always refused because I wasn't a melee bard.  Before obtaining my epic, I strictly used instruments when fighting.  Therefore I didn't think it would be fair that I random on the cloak when someone else would make better use of it.<br>
<br>
However, not only are there bards out there who *DO* melee, there are bards such as myself who do melee, who have their epic.<br>
<br>
The bard epic procs a group-wide 55% haste that stacks with haste items, and though the haste component doesn't stack, it will stick to someone who has most other hastes on.  The reason for it, is that it has a direct +30 atk increase, +30 str (which adds to atk even more), and I believe it may have one or two other stat increases.<br>
<br>
Now, if this were a guild event, I would more than likely pass in favor of warriors and monks, and would expect other paladins, rogues, rangers, and SK's to do so as well.  Rangers and rogues get equipment haste better than the cloak on their epic, and warriors/monks would do more damage than any of the other melee classes if they were to get the cloak of flames.<br>
<br>
However, be'n that this is a pickup raid, I have the interests of myself and my guild in mind.  Yes, my damage input increases if I have cloak of flames.  However, the more I swing my weapon, the more chances it has of procing.  The buff that it procs lasts 2.5 minutes, which means either we need to have constant pulls on raids to keep the haste up, or I need a lot of dex &amp; existing haste to keep my group hasted.<br>
<br>
If i can keep my group hasted consistently, that saves the enchanters and shamans 4 people they don't need to buff with haste every 20-30 minutes, which saves mana, which will allow us to have less downtime, etc.  When we're fighting large encounters that need the best haste (ie., a dragon, maestro of rancor, etc), of course we'd want enc haste.  However, fighting average things in PoH, The Hole, etc, 55% haste that is free is going to help the raid out more than an enc spending mana to haste people.<br>
<br>
Now, you could say 'what if the enc's have their epic?  That's a 30 minute 60% haste'.  True, but currently my guild has no epic'ed enchanters, though we're working on it.  However, they won't need to worry about who does and doesn't have haste up any longer to make sure they are hasting them, if I'm able to facilitate the need.  Basically, as I've stated before to other people, bards are about efficiency.  If I can make my group more efficient (thereby making the raid more efficient) with a haste item, then why not?<br>
<br>
Now, back on topic.  I go on this raid, and tell them I won't join if I'm not allowed on the cloak.  The person leading it agrees, and I explain it to everyone when we're in the chat room after buffing.  So here I've contributed the strategy they needed (nagafen ended up warping to his spawn point, I honestly think that without the information that I imparted to them, however, they would have lost ... not to mention half the raid was buffed improperly.  Someone gave too many buffs before I could stop them, and resist magic and fire wasn't landing on a lot of people ... some of which were in my group, who received my bard MR / FR buffs that probably helped a LOT with keeping them from being feared / flamed easily)<br>
<br>
So, suddenly i have a bunch of people bitching at me, the ONLY bard on the raid, who wanted in on the cloak.  Out of 25 other melee's (26 including myself), they were complaining.  We then get done killing the dragon, and there were some casters who were very upset they aren't allowed in on the random.<br>
<br>
Now, I stated what items go to what classes in chat, and they agreed to continue.  I told them they could leave if they like, because it's not going to change, and they stayed, therefore they agreed.<br>
<br>
So now here people are calling me, tim, and other people present greedy ... why, because we weren't going to let some necromancer roll on an item he'd have sold in ebay commons.<br>
<br>
So I ask you for your opinions everyone ... I promise I won't flame your opinion (however I will respond with reasons for why I think your wrong), and I would hope no one else will either, if you disagree with my point of view ... what do you think should happen on pickup raids?<br>
<br>
Here we're trying to serve the greater good by giving the items to someone who will directly use them, and not someone who'll just go hawk it ... and some greedy necro starts whining about the hp/ac/dex on it that he couldn't give a rats ass about on any other item.<br>
<br>
What would you do, if you were leading the raid?<br>

Pretty much all the time on a pick up raid someone is bitching or not happy.  My advice there is stay away from pick ups.  <br>
<br>
As for the CoF I think that should go souly to the monks and wars,  sks, pallies a close seconded.  As for my thoughts on a bard being able to be in a roll for the CoF I think is bunk.  I am a bard and I melee all the time.  Now I know everyone plays different but IMO bards really don't need a haste item like that (even a bard with a epic).  If you really want a haste item get a Fbss, or one the them swirlspine belts, etc.  Or just save some pp and buy a CoF, dont jipe a tank, or monk out of getting one that way. <br>

<br>
CoF 36% haste compared to FBSS 21% haste makes ya swing 12% more if ya have no other haste on (spell that is, comparing FBSS to CoF). That means you have 12% more chance to proc the wep. (1.36 / 1.21) * 100% for those who think its not that way.<br>
<br>
You also made it clear BEFOREHAND that you want to roll for it or you're out. Good thing to do in a pickup raid anyway - to clear things out beforehand. They agreed your terms, therefore you are allowed to roll.<br>
<br>
Nothing here to bitch about. Good reasons making there be 26 instead of 25 melees to roll.  <p>---<BR>

<br>
On the broader point, I don't think a bard has any business rolling on a CoF.  If I recall correctly, you tried to make a similar argument a couple months ago on this board.  Now your argument is a little different, because you have your epic.  You seem to be saying that, if you have more haste, you swing your epic more often, and there is a greater chance that your epic will process.  Sorry, but that's pretty thin.  I wouldn't take away a CoF from a warrior, monk, etc. just so your epic would process a little bit more often. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1276<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/28/01 12:18:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> If the raid leader agreed to let you roll ahead of time, then you should be in.  End of story.<br>
My take on bards and uber haste:  uber haste is good for two reasons.  One, it lets you deal more damage.  Two, it helps you to taunt more effectively, thus tanking better.  Rogues, rangers and monks are damage dealing classes, and thus should be in for uber haste (arguments over epics notwithstanding).  Paladins and SKs are tanks, and thus can definitely use the extra taunting power, and they're sort of halfassed damage dealers.  Warriors deal damage and tank, so there's a no brainer.<br>
Bards deal halfassed damage, and do not tank.  It's debatable whether that's enough reason to let them into haste randoms, personally I say no.  If it were something like an FBSS or whatever I'd say sure, but not for an item that's as rare and prized as most uber haste items.  <br>

It was horrible and wretched.  It was also very apparent that of the 30 people or so, well over half had never been to a large scale raid, much less a Plane before.<br>
<br>
First of all, people would NOT SHUT UP!  The spam was horrendous and no one knew what was going on.  The raid leader was constantly telling people to be quiet but no one was listening to her.<br>
<br>
Pulls were awkward at first but started going better for awhile.  People finally got into the rhythm and it was going good.  But then it happened, a level 60 Druid who admitted to being Ebayed started claiming he could pull better.  His high level Paladin friend was backing him up and the two of them were annoying as hell.  I eventually put the Druid on ignore but couldn’t do the same with the Paladin (at the time I was still playing Islington and needed to know if a Paladin item dropped).  About the same time that pulls were going better people started to ask for mobs to get pulled.  Clerics were asking for Clerics of Inny to get pulled, Warriors wanted those mummy things, Shamans wanted their Golems etc.<br>
<br>
During this whole mess we didn’t get many armor pieces but we got lots of gems.  All higher level gems (diamonds, blue diamonds and the like) were being randomed first between the groups and then between the members of that group.  My group hadn’t won a single gem in about 12 drops and the group leader was being VERY loud about that fact.  We then get a kill and the leader loots a Diamond.  He immediately says to be quiet about it and we’re going to keep it.  At this point I send a tell to the raid leader telling her that a Diamond dropped and she blows up at the group leader.<br>
<br>
The final straw was the trains.  Idiots trained the camp 3 times in 30 minutes.  Everytime I managed to camp out but after the last one, a Druid friend of mine and I told the Raid Leader we were leaving.  She understood perfectly and we left.<br>
<br>
Anyway to the Bard rights issue:<br>
<br>
I agree with the majority of people here.  If it was agreed beforehand that a Bard could roll on a Cloak of the Flames then there should be no arguments or problems.  Make it clear before the Dragon run and there are no problems.<br>
<br>
Now I, personally, don’t think that a Bard really needs a Cloak of the Flames for the same reasons listed above.  Rangers, Monks, and Rogues can use this to increase their damage potential.  They do great damage and a COF will allow them to do even better.  Paladins and Shadow Knights are main tanks and a COF will allow them to taunt and maintain aggro better.  A Warrior is a combination of these two groups and will maximize the use of a COF.<br>
<br>
From what I understand, a Bard is a support class.  They’re not there to do damage and they’re not there to hold aggro.  They ARE there to enhance the group and make it work more efficiently.  Now a Cloak of the Flames may get your Uber Sword to proc more often but the group is not (or should not be) relying on that sword to go off.  They SHOULD be relying on the Rogue to drop the mob fast and they SHOULD be relying on the Paladin to hold aggro on him though.<br>
<br>

Is this the same raid where the paladin who originally won the burnt book got jipped because the person rerolled before he could loot it to add the person who came right before the raid started uninvited (not my words, this is secondhand information, so it might not even be true)? anyway, if it was that will make me even more glad i stay continuealy away from pickup raids now. <br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
<br>
Same raid, and this is exactly why I don't like handling randoms.  If I don't handle the randoms, I'm not the one making the mistake, and I'm not the one getting blamed.<br>
<br>
To everyone else who says bards don't have any business, etc ... there's a couple of bards on this server with dragon level haste items who are 50+, and have told me just how useful it's been for them.  They don't seem to have a problem with gaining too much aggro, it helps them deal more damage, etc.<br>
<br>
As for a warrior or monk needing it more, honestly speaking, I didn't know half the people on that raid.  I've been raiding for 5 months now, and haven't seen a majority of those melee's around.  The item could and would be useful to me, and would help on raids that I attend for things to be more efficient.  Personally I think all bards should be allowed in the random, but if for no other reason, yes, I think my epic procing is just as important.<br>
<br>
However, as I said in my original post, if this were a guild sponsored event, or if this were a multi-guild event where my guild &amp; guilds I raid with regularly were there, I would pass in favor of warriors &amp; monks.  Our guild is capable of doing what's necessary to complete the rogue and ranger epics, but if the item stayed in the guild after they comlpeted their epic, then they should be in the random as well.<br>
<br>
I don't need to 'justify' my actions to anyone, I want opinions here.  I really do think that bards should be allowed on haste items.  The very fact that everyone on these pickup raids think it's ok to let shadowknights and paladins in on the random when they melee about as well (double attack is ever so slightly better than dual wield at younger levels, they are about even at higher levels), is just absurd.  I gain so little taunt with the amt of damage I deal with dot's + melee &amp; buffing my group, that I can honestly say I don't think the extra damage I'd deal would cause me any problems.  At 53 I also gain a song that decreases my aggro similar to the rogue evade skill, so even if I was gaining too much aggro, I can alleviate that quite easily.<br>
<br>
As for my argument a few months ago, that was a different argument altogether.  In that argument I was comparing the loss you perceive from a bard rolling on cloak of flames to letting a caster take a white scale in stead of a bard for their epic.  (ironic isn't it, people think it would be a waste when if they took a minute to look beyond their prejudice, it's not any more of a loss than handing it to a paladin or shadowknight)<br>
<br>
I could go into detail on that, but that isn't the point of this discussion.<br>
<br>
Now, back on topic people.  Pickup raid.  Most of these people I don't raid with.  I would like a haste item not only to improve my damage output, but it helps me on raids.  yes or no, and why?<br>

Unfortunately for old world dragons it seems to be the only raids happening. <br>
<br>
In this case, they stated who would be able to roll before raid and that should be the final word. If someone had a problem with it BEFORE raid they should have said something then.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the whole discussion about a bards needing it or not I think it depends on the bard. For those of you who have not played a bard, go read the The Concert Halls messageboard. There are as many was to play a bard as there are people playing them. No one opinion is right or wrong but that is what makes bards fun.  Personally I use weapons most of the time, unless I am in OS where I play enchanter more than anything. My role changes with the group I am in and I know that Des does the same, we have raided together. Right now I don't have any haste items at all but I do use faster weapons as oppossed to high damage.(to me more swings means more chance to hit.) My songs are my haste. I never plan to try for a COF, I do feel my tanks in guild will benefit more from it and would not want to keep one from getting it. But as Des stated it was a pick-up raid. You agree before hand  don't whine afterwards.<br>
<br>
If you go raiding with me expect to go by NBG. I rely on the honesty of my members in regards to if they really need an item or not. On pick-up raids you don't have around you people you can rely on to be that honest. Sad as that is...<br>

<font color ='yellow'>Now, back on topic people. Pickup raid. Most of these people I don't raid with. I would like a haste item not only to improve my damage output, but it helps me on raids. yes or no, and why?</font><br>
<br>
If you want one so bad, buy one or lead a Naggy raid specifically stating that if one drops, you get it.<br>
No if's, and's, or but's about it.<br>
<br>
1. Everyone will know up front,<br>
2. You'll get your haste, and <br>
3. Everyone will be happy that we don't have to discuss this dead horse of 'Who deserves what kind of haste'.<br>
<br>
Anyone and everyone can come up with some lame reason why they deserve haste, especially dragon haste:<br>
<br>
"Oh, I'm running around with Innoruuk's Curse. It has a 250 lifetap dot proc on it. If I had dragon haste and alot of dex, I'd swing more, it would proc more, thus saving the cleric mana on trying to heal me."<br>
"Well I've got the Fiery Hilt, and it stuns. so if I have 36% more haste and dex, I'll have a chance at keeping mobs in suspended animation for the whole fight, less damage on us, more things we can do..."<br>
"Well, my orc pick doesn't have alot in the damage category, but I like the way I look when I swing it really fast..."<br>
<br>
blah blah blah...<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but this question is lame, the thread is lame, and all it's going to do is have people bitch, piss, and moan over who they think should get what.<br>
YOU want one? lead a raid, or have it stated in the rules that if one drops it's yours.<br>
<br>
I hope you get what you want, everyone should have the ability to improve their characters.<br>
<br>

Even casters can benefit a small amount from haste, but everyone knows they don't benefit enough to make it worth the item. Also the problem is not the bard hits too fast and gains too much aggro. Haste helps aggro. I am sure bards can deal with the added aggro and not take hits but that isn't the point. SKs, Pallys, and Warriors want that added aggro to help hold taunts. So where the haste-taunts is something a bard can handle having, it is something that another class would benefit from having. Also I am pretty sure the added dmg from haste is more for even Pallys and Sks than bards. Bards even get their own song that has a great haste effect at lvl 55 (maybe lower but I think I heard 55).<br>
<br>
so all depends on how you look at it, if you say it is for anyone who benefits from it, then anyone who can wear it should roll. If you say only the class it is best for should have it, then only warriors should roll. I am sure most people are in the middle of those 2 extremes, where you drawn the line usually depends on the class you are playing at raid time.<br>
<br>
So yeah should bards who have no sense of greed what so ever roll on a CoF? no<br>
Would I roll on it if I was a bard? yes<br>
<br>
If someone says they will roll on an item and all the raiders agree, you will have peoples approval, but no one is going to praise you for rolling on it.<br>

However, there is one rule, whether you ALL/ALL, NBG, MY LOOTZ!1!!1!, or whatever else half brained loot system you use, to allow you that last piece of uberdom, so you can maintain your inflated electronic ego.<br>
<br>
If a class will benefit from it directly, and will use the item, they should be allowed in.<br>
<br>
If you want to make your guild raids have CoF's Warrior first? Good. You want to play a level 60 Necro in full melee gear? Good. It's your game. It's your game. It's your FUCKING GAME.<br>
<br>
Every time I see some online avatar talk about how they're ridding some other class of their chance to own some &quot;L33t&quot; gear, I want to stick my head in a mailbox, and shoot it with a shotgun. (No offense, Arikel. Talking to the masses) <br>
<br>
I fully understand, and partially condone, the argument that items should go to who will use them, and not to who could sell them. <br>
<br>
However, it's your game, and your character, so do whatever the hell you want, as long as it adheres to the basic rules and schematics of the raid you attended. But, don't expect someone to adhere to your rules, because *insert random theme muscic* IT'S THEIR GAME TOO!! DING DING DING.<br>
