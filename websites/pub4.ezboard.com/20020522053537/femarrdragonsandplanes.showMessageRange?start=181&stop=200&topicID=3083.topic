Until now I'd see you as too easy a target but I'm starting to believe that nobody is actually as stupid as you make it out to be. What you fail to realise is that although Mitch needs some support right now, as the vote indicates, she herself is too stupid to realise. Furthermore, if you she were to recognize that fact do you honestly believe you are the person to be helping her? Your words have so little credibility on these boards that you could announce that grass is green and many of us would have to check that you actually have something right.<br>
<br>
I've seen people come and go on these boards and I'll be buggered if I can't remember someone more stupid then you. Some of those people have said some truly disgusting and unfunny things but I've never been in doubt that there is a glimmer of what is right in their being. You see they must know right from wrong to be so horrible to others. Some have been very nasty yet strangely funny but you don’t even have that going for you.<br>
<br>
Do you honestly believe that 297 people are on a bandwagon that Chukzombi, Vendrix, Dwarkarn, Carathos and I started? That simply is not true. Time and time again I log on to this board to see threads derailed from any practical use by Mitch. I watched for over a year as Mitch stalked Dwarkarn through thread after thread before I said a word but was I guided by another? I don't think so. Simply I spoke up because I was tired of it. When Mitch made her claim to fame for destroying a bracer that was not hers she alienated all those idealists that frequently post in the scammers section, she alienated every member of The Institute to whom Areo was a member, she alienated every friend Areo had ( no small number ). Not only that she did something no other scammer has done to date. Take your time to peruse the scammer’s board and look at how many people apologized. Look at how many defended themselves but show me one scammer that not only did not apologize but actively screamed how proud she was.<br>
<br>
Whilst you are doing some research there are a few other posts I'd like you bookmark for later attention. First of all there is Mitch announcing to all that she scammed Pidnus. You'll find that in Scammer's. Secondly there is a thread concerning Nirecnad and his posting of private information in RnF. Finally there is a post regarding the attempted sale of a shield by Seolblade for which he was deguilded from LoR.<br>
<br>
Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin. Let's start with the thread regarding Nirecnad. In this dozens of members felt justified that they had made a decision about Nire. They said they vetoed him for a reason and then he proved that reason to him by his actions. You later had some comments on the matter in another thread. Mitch claims she destroyed the bracer because Areo slandered her. Please take the time to explain to me how this is different. A period of time passed in which Mitch had not returned the bracer despite being asked numerous times and despite being asked to set a time and date by a number of people who post on this board. When this did not happen Areo stated quite clearly that he thought Mitch was trying to scam him. Mitch played the slander card and destroyed the bracer. Effectively she scammed Areo out of the bracer, which in turn justified everything that had been said about her.<br>
<br>
There are some things you do not do to friends. Yes that is right. Mitch claimed to be friend of Areo's until the moment of slander. In my opinion this reduces you to the spot on the bottom of life's arsehole. Less then scum. Others felt the same way. To be honest I think she'd sold the bracer and couldn't return it until she found a new one to buy but although once again others had the same opinion it still remained and will remain conjecture for a long time to come. <br>
<br>
Touching briefly onto the Pidnus post you yourself have advocated on this board several times that two wrongs do not make a right. The last occasion I can think of where you took this stance was the matter with Vendrix training Ewle. Your attitude towards the situation was something along the lines that Vendrix was wrong to train someone no matter how much grief she had caused to the rest of the playing community. I seem to remember you were quite aggressive. Now I’m sure there have been occasions more recently where you have taken this stance again. I’ll be honest I skim any section of a thread which bears your name in more then 50% of the posts.<br>
<br>
Now perhaps you can’t see because your nose is shoved so far up Mitch’s arse that you keep contradicting your own belief system. Mitch admitted to scamming Pidnus. So in this occasion that wrong becomes a right? No. Yet you still carry on supporting Mitch who by her own admission has scammed two people. The evidence is mounting up isn’t it.<br>
<br>
You see this is a hollow victory to me because first of all Mitch cannot determine wrong from right and admit that destroying the bracer was wrong. Secondly I think scamming Pidnus is something we’d all have benefited from. So admitting to this is not in my eyes an offence. However, the belief system you try to enforce on us says this is wrong. However, personal conjecture as it may be I do not believe Mitch actually scammed Pidnus but invented the story to make her own flagging approval rating soar. It failed.<br>
<br>
On another note if you read my last paragraph again you’ll note that I mention that Mitch cannot determine right from wrong. She cannot see that destroying someone else bracer is a bad thing. Not knowing wrong from right is the first definition and requirement of the word pathological. Look it up sometime.<br>
<br>
Plenty of people replied in Seolblade’s post saying that although his actions may have warranted de-guilding it did not warrant stealing an item that did not belong to them. Nobody said, &quot;Yes deguild him and keep the item too&quot;. So no matter what Areo called Mitch that did not give her the right to destroy that item. If Areo was being unfair and not giving her enough time that still does not give her the right to destroy the item. However, from my recollection there was enough time for the item to be passed back. That wasn’t the issue. Areo would have waited 6 months if Mitch had said “look, I’m really busy but I promise you I still have the item and am willing to return it” That was not the case.<br>
<br>
Mitch has talked enough shit on these boards to make her own enemies. As Elwyn said the camp in favour of banning requires no support or trickery. Time and time again she has posted allegations against several people often without the slightest shred of evidence yet when someone posts what they know to be true it is constantly refuted with the need for proof. Proof, which Mitch never requires for her tirade.<br>
<br>
Every time Mitch has slipped up so as to prove herself wrong it has been met with the reply of /yawn or “your opinion does not matter to me”. Do you think my random reply generator was funny for any other reason than that it struck a chord with people?<br>
<br>
You take on a brave task. To prove to the Erollisi Marr community that Mitch is a good person is like trying to convince the pope that people have given the devil a bad rap. You aren’t going to win under any circumstances. That is why Mitch went to Antonius Bayle. You see I have friends on Erollisi Marr and under no circumstances would you catch me leaving for another server based on time differences. I’m from the UK too as are many of us, but we can’t leave our friends behind for a shot at uberness. It’s wrong. See above.<br>
<br>
Many others feel that way. See every thread in General at the time that AB went live.<br>
<br>
But that leads me on to you doesn’t it Chiteng. In the time that all this has taken place people have begun to join the hurly burly. Proving Mitch for the liar she is, is like catching the Loch Ness monster, and everyone wants to be that person. We’re all pretty sure that there’s something in that lake, we don’t know what it’s going to be but we know it’s there. During the quest for the Loch Ness monster people have made slip-ups, made allegations that were untrue, or that could not be proved. Some have let fantastic opportunities slip like sand through their fingers and given the Mitch camp plenty of ammo.<br>
<br>
At last count there were about 6 of you and you’re all too stupid throwing rocks clumps of grass whilst plenty of ammo lies within your reach. You are really that fucking dumb. And that’s what un-nerves me. I know the way most people work, I can to an extent guess how people act, react and interact. I have never been able to lower my intellect to a level low enough to comprehend what you will say next, or the stance you will take in a given argument. You’re thoughts and ideas have been up and down more then a whore’s knickers, erratic to say the least. You seem to relish any opportunity to contradict what you said 2 minutes earlier to a point where I’m wondering if you have some attention deficit disorder and don’t actually know what your position is on the subject.<br>
<br>
The crusades need to end because as mentioned in another thread we’d care about your predicament if you mattered on a personal level. Vendrix has proved on more then one occasion that he can be an ass and he’s had the good grace to admit it on as many occasions if not more. Still he garners more respect from the community and from me then you ever will. If he wants to target someone in a game that hasn’t launched yet by way of reprimand for their actions here perhaps you could consider his two reasons. What I have mentioned above, namely the reasons for disliking Mitch, plus the fact that this game allows no repercussions anymore. It’s interesting to note that Mitch’s posts took a downward spiral at roughly the same time that character transfers became available. Knowing you have a get out of jail free card is enough to drive anyone to folly. Can you imagine her delight when AB came online and she could use the time difference as an excuse? If she’s had a sufficient quantity of friends she would be happy raiding Kael Plaza as she would Veeshans Peak.<br>
<br>
Let me state this very clearly. You don’t have many friends. You cannot afford to lose them in this game but you choose to alienate people you have never met. By siding with Mitch in an issue where to 90% of the community foul play is agreed upon you in turn take on the dislike from that 90%. You really need to stop posting and find some time to think who you are and what you really believe in. To me you are the definition of the words sheep, follower, disciple and bandwagons. I don’t think you’ve ever posted a rational thought that was all your own.<br>
<br>
You see I really believe the Mitch camp is smaller then you think. To vote on whether Mitch should be banned from this board does not reflect those who think Mitch is an arsehole yet disagree with banning people or censorship in general. Perhaps a fairer question would be to ask for a vote on “If you had to vote to ban one person from this board would it be Mitch? Yes or No” would be more accurate.<br>
<br>
The camp in favour of Mitch gets smaller by the day and you don’t help by letting your stench waft through it driving others out. They simply do no want to be associated with you in any way and it would not surprise me in any way shape or from that Mitch thinks you’re a fool too.<br>

<br>
2) Is it right to scam another person out of items and money in this game?<br>

As far as the Bracer, at most the player who 'theoreticly' owned the bracer<br>
has some claim on Mitch. It isnt a scarce or valued item.<br>

If it were as common as you would like us all to believe why cant you provide<br>

I am hampered in what I can do from here, because I am behind a firewall<br>

You read a bit, hit reply and post. After you've posted you read a bit more and you reply again.<br>
<br>
First of all you look like a complete pratt when you take information out of context and secondly it stops me having to wait 20 minutes for a coherent argument in return.<br>
<br>
Let me clarify. Is it a good or bad thing to intentionally deprive someone of something they own? Thats what I'm asking you. It's a very simple question.<br>
<br>
Let's try some more ( remember read everything before posting ). Is it wrong to actively wish another person dead? Is this the sort of person you wish to associate with?<br>
<br>
Now I'm going to play your own card against you. I want you to provide me with more then one supported fact that Vendrix has intentionally trained someone and broken the rules. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
Good dodge Chitlins.  How is Ven's training different from Mitch's theft?  Surely &quot;at most the player who 'theoreticly' [was trained]<br>
has some claim on [Vendrix].&quot;  See the contradiction there?<br>
<br>
Who said it was common for Mitch to do these things?  Why should that matter?  Under your own reasoning as stated on numerous occasions and cited by Kerryn, once a thief - always a thief.<br>
<br>
The only possible way in which you could not be aware of Mitch breaking the rules is if you really are hiding in a bunker in North Dakota, having your posts prescreened for you by the little green man in your head.  She's admitted to all of the above over and over and over again.  She's reveled in breaking the rules.  Go to where you've been directed and check up on our allegations.  It shouldn't be too hard, even for you.  She's reveled in posting anonymously on this board, rather than under the names of her actual chars on EMarr, a clear violation of the rules.<br>
<br>
And you are wrong again in your binary world view.  There are other choices besides the two you've listed regarding the alleged hacking.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 755<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/6/02 10:03:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kerryn</span><hr size=1> Well one would assume his own statement that he did it would carry some merit.<br>

We know Vendrix trained Ewle, as well as a few of his friends in Velk's (who he then rezzed).  We aren't denying this occurred.  Why are you denying Mitch's actions to which she has admitted?<br>
