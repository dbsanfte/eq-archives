Dinu, now imagine me giving you shit every time we talked and not listening to a fucking word you said. That's not how I treat <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> friends. I used to enjoy those conversations w i t h  y o u  w h e r e  w e  t r i e d  to drive each other nuts, would've been cool if you remembered that I used to be a &quot;friend&quot; when you were cursing me out for KSing Umoja.<br>
<br>
Ealan, I believe we only talked once on this subject and I apologize for not trying harder than I did to make sure you guys got into the rotation. However, this was because I believed you guys capable of doing what RoD or Institude did (within the past month) and getting there while no other guilds were there and taking VS down. Honestly, VERY honestly, he is not instantly taken down or camped by the guilds in the rotation. Affliction's turn usually comes up post-patch and we get him within 6 hours. That's considered fast compared to the Japanese guilds which usually down him after a day, DG which usually downs in after a day, SF usually when I send Yenom a tell going &quot;foo, your VS is up!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And those are normal patch days when we know he's going to be up. I think it was totally within your ability as a guild to get there IMMEDIATELY after a patch and down him without anyone else being there.<br>
<br>
I did however mention to Yenom that you spoke to me and wanted to get back in the rotation, and I did tell you that he was the person to talk to when we spoke.. not sure if you remembered that, but you posted that nobody told you.<br>

<br>
When did any guilds WANT other guilds to join the rotation ?<br>
<br>
When it was just DK i'm sure they didn't want MS in. And when it was MS and DK they sure didn't want SF in ... after getting run around for a while we got on early after a patch and killed him (and the flaming started) because thats the only way those of us online thought we could get into the rotation (we had to prove we could kill him, but there was no way we could get a shot at him for free)<br>
<br>
<br>
Basicly it was the rules that DK/now Magister and MS made that Magister could not be bothered to adhere to because killing VS was not worth much effort. VS has often been up for a long time, but obviously magister didn't want to show up when he was free ... they preferred just walking in when they wanted and pull him over the party who were buffing up for him. If it was so hard to get him, why has a ton of less known guilds been able to get shots at him ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Saying that you couldn't get a shot at him is bullshit, and no matter which kind of spin you put on what you did you fucked up hard<br>

<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      Checked the SF boards and this is the lowdown :<br>
<br>
      Current Rotation:<br>
<br>
SF MS TGL CE PC DG Aff "UNITED INDEPENDENT" Institute JP<br>
<br>
Not real positive if TGL is still around to use their spot.<br>
JP is a coalition of Japanese guilds.<br>
<br>
From time of VS spawn you have 24 HOURS to put him down otherwise the next guild is up.<br>
<br>
In order to obtain a spot you need to beat one of the aforementioned guilds to a VS spawn. When you beat them your next turn is after their turn on the next rotation. Guilds that are 'bumped' in this fashion still go next unless they purposfully gave their afirmation to another guild to take their spot. Trading spots is ok but please talk to other people in the rotation in advance.<br>
<br>
Those are pretty much the rules the guilds that were killing VS decided on when it was discussed.<br>
<br>
The next VS is Affliction's.<br>
<br>
Yenom <br>
<br>
<br>
Based on the way I went about doing VS :<br>
<br>
[1] Asked Yenom who was next in Rotation ....<br>
[2] Found out MS was next guild in rotation ... this was a few days prior to 03/06/01 [ The date CE took out VS ].... at this point , I subtlely let MS know my intentions with VS ...<br>
[3] After camping KC off and on for 3 days , I found out that VS was up and posted at 7 am MST to guild board , and we took out VS a few hours later...<br>
[4] CE eventually took out VS [ add that there were 2 other guilds in the zone inquiring when we were going to do him ] ....<br>
[5] Now that CE is in the rotation , we are trying our best to respect the rotation [ may be another 7 spawns before CE gets their shot ...lol ]<br>
<br>
       I hope everyone involved can take this post objectively ... just my 2 cps ....<br>

As far as the "VS affair" goes, Ealan aknowledged he had acted badly and apologized for it.<br>
<br>
He shouldnt have done it and he knows it. <br>
<br>
Now, does Magister need more wizzie staff?? Or are they also in for the leggings?<br>
<br>
If they just need the staff, can you see if you can find an arrangement with the guild doing VS to loot the staff only? And let them do VS and, maybe, help them doing it without "KSing"??<br>

(and I can't spell :P)  Anyway, I do feel the Magister (Koryo) should have shown a little more courtesy.  If UI was already prepping to kill VS, they should have backed down.  Hell, UI gave you guys plenty of shots to kill VS.  I know there were a few times people said in guild that VS was up and no guilds there to kill.  I mean, if UI had a monk feigned near his spawn, that's different, however with almost 2 groups already there, I wouldn't have KSed VS.  It's just a common courtesy, that I think is all too uncommon nowadays.  Yes, I did actually side with UI on this! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><HTML>

  That being said, whats so bad about it?  We could go back to the good old &quot;first in, first served&quot; thing again if you really want, and all of us playing ATM could get to experience the heady joys of sleep deprivation as we try to have enough people on when a_random_bunch_of_pixels00 spawns with some neat pixelly loot.<br>

Due to contrary opinion we do try to be nice guys and try to stick to our agreements(when we make them with people).  As far as Bubu's gracious act, i'm glad you didnt go and do something you can/will get suspended/banned for and which a GM would most likely reimburse said item. I'd hate for you to lose your character over something stupid like that.<br>
<br>
Thadew, I think you need to KS Dain if you want in on the rotation =0  Seriously though good luck next time you guys can give him a try.<br>

The answer is yes, either we'll wait our turn for the next killing now that we're back in said rotation(done the hard way) or attempt again to purchase the wizzie staffs from the guilds who don't need them.  We really don't want to kill VS anymore than the other people who didn't want us to kill him.<br>

Also anyone think I should update my little picture and can you identify the armor i'm wearing in it?<br>

Because the flames about this have never been about the rotation just the blatent lack of respect for United Independent shown by Magister and that can be worked out between those two guilds.<br>
<br>
Rotation is this next go round:<br>
<br>
SF MS TGL CE PC DG Aff UI Mag Ins Jp<br>
<br>
UI Ins and Jp need to go before the rotation restarts.<br>
<br>
The reason the rotation is set up this way is so that guilds who will be able to kill him on time their turn and waste as little time as posible are in the rotation.<br>
<br>
Just a post for the people who were wondering how this will effect the rotation.<br>
<br>

Hah Elwyn yeah the rotation thing kinda sucks but I hate Ragefire more.  Oh and BTW you were one of the people bitching in the Vendrix post on our old board when we went in and killed VS before Da`Kor showed up after a patch. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2023.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2538.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2560.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2023.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2023.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2023.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2023.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
