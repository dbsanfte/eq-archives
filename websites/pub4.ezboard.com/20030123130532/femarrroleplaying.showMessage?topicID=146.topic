                     INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
<br>
Plain sight de-cries what vivid moments that stark silence fell cold upon all the screams of a lost multitude. Drowning out all their tumult of war. <br>
<br>
Whether centuries, tho or just brief moments ago the quiet dirge of herald winds sigh lament over those forsaken bones just as they have ever done. Whisper the rumour of mortal flesh a forgotten dead had once hugged close around them. <br>
<br>
Silence, or an uneasy grief. <br>
<br>
Time's stamp paces slow. Always its unwavering Eye linger's here. Over the vast howling ruin. <br>
<br>
The walls of a lost Citadel, in enduring, may remember that fae folk which had even wrought them. Who can say? Proud, desperate people, who a'fire with dire purpose had set at naught warm hearths they knew here, forevermore. Wrenched themselves away from a sudden despair that measured their entire race; uprooted all, answering in their indignant reply with an angry wrath, and shook them, rising wholly from all their labours as one; abandoned harvest, the meadow fields, and mills of toil, and so leaving well tempered fires to colden that sharp grief with unquenching tears: Valor arose burning bright there, oh yes! Valor which shone bright in immortal eyes, and drew admiration there. A dismayed folk that live enduring their despair, still...  <br>
<br>
So remorse cries, ever lowing, '..who also fell? Who also is lost among all these abandoned dead?' <br>
<br>
What revulsion gape'd in this evil place so long ago? <br>
<br>
Stars glitter and they will yet shine silently on. <br>
<br>
Choking in trampled upheaval on all the gore of bits of fair flesh; choked under their own lifedust, their swathe of bloody conflict there, ever nameless: a sacred memory. See, here yip's stricken grass, and witness, over there, the last stunted forest Oaks. Lo' how the land is changed. These things know it.    <br>
<br>
For beneath the ground here somewhere some dark forbidden death is laid hid in the precious soil. That unalterable stench does not ever fade. <br>
<br>
Enchantment, ripples of some magical power preserving something of this ancient leafy sanctuary yet, which stood here. Glad memories to hearten the wandering passerby, perhaps? Memories that shape, and form, and bloom into life, and mushroom'd here unnumbered Ages long ago in a leaping forest of uncanny high wildernesses. <br>
<br>
Up there, above the retreating forest lofty birdsong is ringing out time. Far beyond the reach of seeking eyes. <br>
<br>
Time measures out all the long while since, here on this ground, and the great forest slowly yield's to it. Unwilling to sup that dark stain. Becomes sickly, and pale, it has yellow'd tender blade, and it has curl'd trembling leaf - where no sere of dark shadows before could ever choke the mighty forest's green light. Though Fire has scorched the forest's leaves black and dunes may creep over its withered branches tho, something here remains! <br>
<br>
Hark thee 'o Wanderer! <br>
<br>
An evil loosed quarrels into this wan verdure. Sorrow here gives us the tale. <br>
<br>
This is the forest glen of bright Elven hame's ancient hall. <br>
<br>

A lone figure came silently through the thick forest trees. Behind it a swell and murmur of audible voices grew louder in the trees, carried from some distance away. Others had followed. In the dark forest great tree trunks drowned farsight, there could be no first glimpse. <br>
<br>
He had sought purposeful way through the trees deep in concentration. Years lay on him, nobly and carefully hued: the rarity of his fading light appeared eldritch. This must be an High Elf , one who bore grey streaks with his stern mien. No few years measured the span of their kind; a strength of will to match that sustained their torrid lifetime in passage through the Ages of Norrath.         <br>
<br>
Birds sang, ah the forest sounded so pleasant! <br>
<br>
A moment's indecision halted his steps. The rhythm of the forest's murmur foremost in his attention. His keen hearing, alert for wary sounds of his stalkers, discerned instead the heartbeats of confident nearby folk approach him. There was no sign of danger. <br>
<br>
Unslinging packs, he deliberately set down Bow and Quiver beside them on a bed of fallen leaves, and allowed himself to relax.<br>
<br>
The old elf stayed a desire to keep travelling ahead. Allowing these strangers to join him and reveal the errand which brought them. He appeared armed. A knight, clad head to toe in blazing Platemail armor, his tunic part-covered a bright metal glint of something else. <br>
<br>
A magnificent thick Snow Leopard fur cloak hung from shoulder to ankles upon his back. Lined with pale blue Silk and trimmed with Sable, its lapels and hem of Ermine. A gift from the North people in admiration for unfailing vigilance in protecting the trading route between his people and theirs. Upon his helm rose the silver wings of the Storm Petrel fashioned as his ears. <br>

Its pommel was long, suggesting a double handed grip, its scabbard fretted with gems and inlaid chased Ivory.  Imladrisel, he was called, for the sword was blessed.<br>
<br>
"So old friend, .." mused the fellow.  "See, already friends come nigh. There are no foes here." He spoke the words as if conversing to somebody standing beside him, yet patted the great sword. <br>
<br>
Touch ignited a sudden fiery light springing forth within blessed Imladrisel. Intense brilliance, shining from depths inside the scabbard that reached all along the length of the blade to the sword tang and pommel. The wise veteran could only shade his shocked stare, blinded at this sight. <br>
<br>
His reeling sensibility seemed to feel Imladrisel' stir, writhe wildly from its wakened rest and unnaturally rise, unsheathed. From mere touch. <br>
<br>
Upon his ears its sound rang out. Unmistakably crying with hot rage as clear as a scream of an Eagle, and to his own staggered amazement Windshoal saw he beheld a Holy Sword of great Tak'ish Hiz truly answer him at last. There in front of him stood Imladrisel.  <br>

When Imladrisel spoke by this omen much was set afoot he could not understand. <br>
<br>
Such signs held within a terrible meaning, he understood a protest against some great evil, implicitly. A very great wrong must cause his unearthly summons. Again he trembled, in fear, for the thought occurred to him now that he was called by The Lady Tunare to oppose some nameless quarrel of heaven, unaided. Yet he also dared not to set aside his doubt for obviously this fearsome enemy must lay somewhere ahead. Reason enough to tremble. <br>
<br>
He barely finished considering anew matters Imladrisel presented to him at this miraculous sight of standing upon thin air, when a new wonder began.<br>
<br>
Imladrisel's long shriek took on deepening pitch until it grew so changed that its scream now became the roar of great conflagration. An awakened blast of filial fire rose within it which sent a resounding shockwave rushing through the great forest: a hurling wind that blew against the very hand of Time. Windshoal was dismayed, for he knew Imladrisel would flare brightly in dire battle. Never did any blazing sword in Elven memory loose forth eldritch brilliance with a similar vehemence.<br>
<br>
"Am I dead?" Windshoal implored the air around him for answer. Nothing stirred, yet he saw that around him the forest still stood. <br>
<br>
"Imladrisel! Am I slain? What is this unnatural thing which I witness? I beseech you, reveal its purpose to me. I am wholly dismayed to percieve my doom graven within your wrath."       <br>
<br>

He spun around in sudden dread, hands fumbling for the sword in his empty scabbard half expecting to face the nameless enemy. Instead, he saw that he looked upon a woodelf maiden clad all in Lambent armor. She impatiently dismissed Imladrisel's roar, as if standing within its holy light was a common sight, and gave motion to Windshoal to take a sealed note which she brought from her satchel. <br>
<br>
His fears forgotten, Windshoal couldn't decide which stunned him more, this maiden's blithe ignorance at Imladrisel's grave sign. Or the fact that she clearly believed her own singular task, a common one, remained still the more urgent of them. Her note bore the Royal Insignia on its parchment wax but surely that could not outweigh his compulsion to The Lady in heaven. <br>
<br>
&quot;Listen, hey look listen, the message is straight from...&quot; began Silvermoss, as politely as she could. <br>
<br>
His frightened glare shot hotly back at her and she noticed the empty scabbard he wore hung at his side. Silvermoss resisted an impulse to throw back her head in laughter and likewise to convince the gawping knight that he must hear their calamitous tidings. He did not even notice her taller companion. <br>
<br>
&quot;That blade is Imladrisel, a holy sword, young maiden. Do you mean to suppose that the King's bidding must foreswear divine purpose, since heaven itself calls me?&quot; he angrily interjected, indicating grandly at his blazing sword before she had even finished. Wisely, she let him recover his wits.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am honor bound to serve you. The SongWeavers guild will not hear of heroic Elf glory voiceless, and unsung; alas, sir knight, here I see you are doomed against hope of an bright outcome. Heaven certainly purposes that you shall oppose its foe with your life. Knightly swords surely cannot be a trifling thing to ponder.&quot; <br>
<br>
Saying this, she had unbuckled the SongWeavers' Singing Shortsword, as instructed, and proffered the famous artefact toward him, head bowed.<br>
<br>
He stymmied a yawn, which might have angered her and the SongWeavers Guild, before it escaped him. Then taking her sword, he stiffly buckled the ancient artefact back around her waist. Girls for travelling companions, he resisted an urge to vent a groan of frustration out loud. This sudden twist was a possibility not encountered among the plans. <br>
<br>
Windshoal was not consoled. Now he clutched a myriad of possibilities, before it had been simple. True, he might not remain among the living after the sign of promised battle had fulfilled his summons. He was grown old. But even with small aid he would fight mightily for his final hours. Perhaps the maid was divinely sent to him for this very purpose? <br>
<br>
&quot;So you it was who always pursued behind me. I grew aware of you days long behind.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Some enemy hunts me&quot;, I thought first.&quot; He opened the parchment without more delay. <br>
<br>
&quot;The palace is ransacked...&quot; it began. &quot;King and Queen are taken from us to where none may guess the place...&quot; and there he stopped reading, Windshoal knew he could not bear to finish more.<br>
<br>
&quot;So this is the meaning of Imladrisel.&quot; His voice sobbed, and broken inside came his thudding heartbeat. The crumpled parchment fell from his hand onto the earth. <br>
<br>
Imladrisel flared painfully brighter. <br>
<br>
From nowhere, a howling wind came rushing in his ears and dizzyness overtook him. His sight faded into sudden darkness and he felt his strength fail him. The moment passed, unnoticed, Silvermoss' voice rang in soft enchantment, singing her words clearly to him... <br>
<br>
&quot;I must know what you think to do, hereafter, sir knight. My own treefolk have abandoned the city, the High Elves all march swiftly in arms to make war here.&quot; Her words unmistakable. Windshoal looked sharply back into her gaze. Presence of mind restoring him to his wits once more.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm saddened, not a single soul has been spared from muster. This matter is perilously great indeed.&quot; Ended Silvermoss, smiling bravely though clearly unsettled. <br>
<br>
The tiny Woodelf plainly had more to say so he nodded his dumb consent.  <br>
<br>
Silvermoss, clasping his elbow for support, strained her Woodelf stature on utmost toetip to gain word at his ear. She officially addressed him. It was his turn to sigh now for the parchment's Royal Seal always warranted salutation. <br>
<br>
Though two Elven peoples dwelt under one united Kingdom, woodelf maidens distinguished the Royal Pageantry through their traditional mode of address to High Office. Nobility they formally announced standing on tiptoe, by ancient custom, and Silvermoss was a woodelf. <br>
<br>
This suggested an upbringing among the court nobility to Windshoal, grinning grimly he was impressed. No less than a Royal handmaiden, eh. Queen's Lady-in-Waiting for certain. Before she went further he bent his head to hear the secret tidings humbly. Allowing Silvermoss opportunity to speak.    <br>
<br>
In the legends of their Royal Court, a woodelf maid on tiptoe had no rival in sneaking past company unobtrusively. Since time immemorial, the High Elves cherished the memorable fleetness of their Queen's loyal train of woodelf handmaidens. In the eyes of Woodelves themselves, however, the way to whisper secretly in the ear of a court High Elf is to reach it first. <br>
<br>
Silvermoss's heraldic formality acknowledged his status and that further enlarged Windshoal's own sense of a gathering doom. He felt the heavy weight of sudden responsibility whelming him. <br>
<br>
She continued, whispering with quavering voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;There is no question, elves give themselves into slavery to be with their King. Slaughter of womenfolk is gruesome indeed: through all the Elddar forest are leftover bones of butchered Woodelf maids. <br>
 <br>
This last, Silvermoss said in matter-of-fact tone but emotion then came broken, and dejected from her lips. Silvermoss' voice trailed away and rallied, speaking again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I observed our kindred meekly go to unholy sacrifice, for their King's sake, and recieve the knife across their throats.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;They march thence, perhaps to Nektulos, without any will. None seeking escape, and they cannot be persuaded otherwise: they do not hear.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Sent to the shadowy enemy's foul table like so much bled cattle.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Finally Silvermoss was miserably silent. Hot tears streaming down her lovely cheeks. <br>
<br>
Numbed by the enormity of what she told him, Windshoal was caught offguard: he did not know what comfort he could offer her for this burden. She collapsed in a fallen heap, clinging fast to his legs now like some desperate child sobbing hysterically at his feet. No words could he speak. The road before their kingdom lay heavily upon him. <br>
<br>

Indicating with her hands in the native woodelven manner at distraught Silvermoss . But alas! with a tongue she uttered in an alien sounding voice. Her talk so unascertainable, to Windshoal, whether as passing for speech or the babble of any small stream. She spoke, apparently, a language but this tongue was unknown to Windshoal: he could not fathom it. <br>
<br>
Silvermoss, fighting herself for a semblance of composure, found herself back up on her feet. With the grace of a SongWeaver, once again the tiny Bard took on the heraldic stance of a court messenger's traditional privy whisper, hoping that tiptoes mattered, and tugging insistently on Windshoal's arm. That she was forced, in a real sense, to literally stand on ceremony and follow the ritual fully in their crisis agitated her. Still, her strange companion was a legitimate Elves affair and this must be made known. Quickly she must explain the stranger's tale for his benefit.   <br>
<br>
"This maiden is descended from a tribe called "Human". A new strain among the Barbarians. Though she is sprung from Elven stock in the sire she is a Marr-child Ward entrusted into Tunare's care with the Elddar Druids." Silvermoss chirped.<br>
<br>
"Even now, though she is mere half-child she may not dwell among her mother's people, and wears but a thong piece for modesty." <br>
<br>
Silvermoss exhibited the young charge with pride so that Windshoal could fully examine her. The girl was not self-consciously aware of an interest in her nakedness, which relieved him immeasurably. Still staring, he guessed she would not wear Tak'ish knight raiment. He motioned her toward his packs, uncovering their contents with a toe poke. Even Silvermoss, eyebrows raised, felt herself relax somewhat curiously in the comfort of their greying High Elf's male concern. Brought up since childhood sheltered from the court's wildest scandals, Silvermoss felt confidence in his presence.<br>
<br>
Her name was Feana. Standing almost as tall as he, Feana customarily went afoot barebreasted. Clad only in tall fur-trimmed moccasins laced up fast with long strips of cord. A leather thong-piece barely covered her crotch, as Silvermoss had said. Shining small dewy leaves had dusted themselves into a sparkling emerald Circlet which perpetually ringed Feana's head atop a shock of astonishing silver hair. <br>
<br>
Hiding his stare, and not a little admiration with it, Windshoal noticed too that her eyes shone with a brilliant green and how she wore an innocent elvish grin. He felt a powerful bright innocence glow about her and Windshoal silently admitted that he felt goodly liking for the foreign girl.<br>
<br>
"I am curious still to hear why she has not covered her breasts. I had thought this was the common fashion of people." He told Silvermoss this privately. The answer though did not surprise him.<br>
<br>
"Feana was cast out from her mother's folk still a tender babe - because of her strangely elvish birth. Her mother did not teach her to dress but to live. The Druid maiden, Feana, walks alone throughout the forest attending great trees and wild creatures."<br>
<br>
"When Druids came upon Feana wandering and alone, in the wilderness, and found her thus naked, they immediately claimed her guardianship for the Lady Tunare of Heaven.  <br>
<br>
"Moreover of her protection, even the Barbarian Goddess, Marr herself, declares Feana's virtue is singularly inviolable, and thereafter warns Tunare's children that heaven is lately divided among factions over the father's kindred - our people the Elves. Thus Feana's arrival upon Norrath has indirectly drawn ire onto the forest: the Druids correctly proclaim Feana is a sacred trust upon all of the elves, in the name of Tunare, Mother of All..." <br>
<br>
Silvermoss paused and drew a deep gasping draught of air. Windshoal hid his sudden amusement. She appeared not to notice, and went on talking. <br>
<br>
"It's a long story, elves agree Feana's birth is noted by all the Gods. Young just as she appears now, ever naked, unchanged. First living of her new race to walk Norrath: heaven is in furore because of it. Mother Tunare has granted this safekeeping to the Elves." <br>
<br>
"Behold!, maidenhood is not lightly sullied." trilled Silvermoss sternly... No longer bound by any formalities of their Court her impatience had at last stretched past breaking.  <br>
<br>
She snatched up Windshoal's arm. Thrusting his hand upon Feana's bosom. Instantly, the sear of tearing flesh burned in his hand, and he let out an involuntary yelp, though withdrew his hand much more slowly. Looking anxiously at his increasingly hasty withdrawn hand he saw it indeed had more than a few freshly scored deep scratches and the entire wrist as well. <br>
<br>
Windshoal felt his face redden, and the two fae women studied his burning complexion with a fascination in their gazes which made his face burn even more.   <br>
<br>
"Feana has said.." began Silvermoss, clearly not done with Windshoal yet. <br>
<br>
Translating for Feana, she continued speaking to him, "Imladrisel's sign is not fatal as you imagine. Therefore do not dismay, holy knight. This sign is a beacon to the Elves. All can see it." <br>
<br>
Apparently, Feana understood his own tongue! Windshoal did not ask if the half-elf child could also speak it, he reasoned that Feana must deliberately wish this secret kept.    <br>
<br>
"Here, finally is the elvish host which sought some sign to follow by", Silvermoss ended. Now Windshoal looked and saw rather that Feana chose a staff, a leather corselet and a sturdy shield. She turned his head, pointing her staff at the growing company of Elven knights newly gathered around them. The keener senses of the maidens had detected these latest Elves arriving before he was aware of them nearby.  <br>
<br>
Brightly armored Paladins kept their gazes averted from the barebreasted Druidess, and they drew even more distance from Feana, when one, an unwitting female in the company, again demonstrated Feana's invisible shield of thorns. <br>
<br>
The proud Paladin glumly nursed deep scratches in her newly bleeding hand. <br>
<br>
She had clutched Feana's wrist meaning kindly to take the maiden aside, and find her some clothing. At the shrugs of her male companions, she glared, it appeared clear that there might soon come quarrelsome blows and so they wisely rummaged around in their packs following Windshoal's lead. Fully a score more elf women rose among the war party, behind her, glaring likewise at knightly elves about the camp. <br>
<br>
No High Elf ever uttered comments at Feana's apparent nakedness or made jokes thereafter. In the Elddar forest strange things had served for their owner's rainment. <br>

Then as magically busied itself with final preparations for the battle. Amid their din and the clatter of metal armor Imladrisel's roar ran through Elves like an intonation of purpose. Windshoal knew with finality he must decide how best to lead this army against the enemy before he dare hold the sword, Imladrisel, aloft. <br>
<br>
Windshoal's brows knotted, he had been feverishly planning the assault even as he appointed officers to carry out the first task of discovering this army's strength of arms and numbering their ranks. It was obvious to him that the sword would reveal to the elves which direction their course lay if he wielded it, but the battle? <br>
<br>
He came to the place he left fiery Imladrisel flaming and found the sword surrounded by a throng of robed Elves uttering enchantment. Amidst all this, Feana spoke in her strange babbling tongue solemnly nodding her head every now and then. Some debate was apparently settled. Feana turned to face Windshoal, now she spoke, addressing him directly in the Elder Elvish.<br>
<br>
"Noble Knight, the sign of Imladrisel is clear to all the Elven lore, not least to my own power, and bound with all our enchantment. None that see this sacred light shall know rest. None shall put aside the path which you must set upon us now to save their people and find your King. It is certain, by such a grave token the Elves will never return to this ancient forest wholly unopposed by evil nor ever again see the great city standing proud." <br>
<br>
Feana did not smile. Something about their dispassionate gloom disturbed him, another burden that lay upon Feana which she did not name. Windshoal guessed that the Druid maiden shared secret knowledge when she spoke in her own tongue to these robed Elves. He could not be sure what power of magic she truly possessed but he guessed it must be very formidable, indeed. By most accounts her mere existence had disturbed the truce between all the gods.            <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/1/02 7:16:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www..\program files\everquest\eq000013b.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/15/01 9:10:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Title: just past the next chance right beside an opportu</span><hr size=1> The gathering numbers of Elves drawn by Imladrisel's light swelled their host to thousands.

Thousands of glittering swords shone against the bright fire of Imladrisel. In amongst the gleaming Elven ranks shone the short swords of Rangers - not least - though stark, half-crazed woodelfs calmly enough held great bows at ready.<br>
<br>
Beyond Imladrisel ran a small stream, a place of natural power rose by it here and the vast Elven host recieved great power from all the spells of Eldritch arcane lore which knowledge possessed: Heroism, Runes, Regrowth, Shield of Words, Aegolism, Swift like the Wind and more were the magicks wrought around the elf host. Windshoal saw that with their power at its fullest it was time he lay hold of Imladrisel, and to begin the fury of his assault. <br>
<br>
Muttering obeisance to Tunare on bended knee, Windshoal rose, and in the full sense of grim war set his hands firmly to grip upon the sword, Imladrisel. With that act ten thousand flaming swords flashed in unison. He noted with satisfaction that the Elves had likewise prayed to the Lady as even he did so himself.  <br>
<br>
Now there was wonder in them all, for their sight saw beyond the Elddar forest across a portal window stretched in front of them into a seperate Plane of the world. A window in the nether-space lay revealed to the Elves, in there a road ran before them. Enclosed on all sides by solid rock as a tunnel. The robed Elves murmured spells of power, some wove binding incantations but stayed their ground, there came nodding murmurs of recognition at this newest revelation within the light of Imladrisel's power. <br>
<br>
Seeing no sign from them to delay longer Windshoal and the army of Paladins surged forward sounding their battle roar.<br>
<br>
Behind him, Windshoal knew the Woodelf Rangers already sensed their enemy, indeed even Silvermoss. Now she beat a chanting song of battle for the whole company on her Selos drum which brought the hot blood rushing through him, their strength rising, unnatural speed hastening them. <br>
<br>
Far ahead he thought he recognised disciples of Hate, though he was at a loss to know what brought the unnatural beings to assemble armed against captive Elves. At once, however, a din of fighting appeared to have set Elves against each other. But Imladrisel screamed louder anew, and the eyes of those entranced Woodelves captive in this place were opened. <br>
<br>
They ran swiftly, in the thousands, past the knights and quickly took their freedom back behind the safe protective wall of the Rangers ranks. Arming themselves quickly. An unnatural power suddenly gripped the foremost knights, cold malice washed them, then from out of the ground a horde of rats and biting insects came. Diseased Rats quickly fevered and weakened elves though more held firm check against this sorcerous attack but their evil lord here did not reckon with the deadly aim of Woodelf archers, nor with the might of holy knights. The rats were quickly put asunder. <br>
<br>
Silvermoss saw Windshoal with the other Paladins raging in furious battle yet further ahead, elves now brought terrifying battle everywhere, ever against greater foes, and the shout of bloody fighting was a river of molten fire running in deadly earnest. <br>
<br>
Dark elf-like creatures, a huge Dracoliche which, she thought, resembled in its terrible onset the fearsome dragons. Dreamlike, she saw them hear the barking doom of immortal Tashani. Saw them glance nervously about. Even at this, knowing that their resistance to Elvish magic was gone, dark foes came at the elves; unworldly bedlam swarmed into the fray at every turn. The shock of furious Elves falling ran like an icy tide. Some withstood an insidious embrace of dark malice but not the evilly poisonous humor of their sudden wounds. <br>
<br>
Fellow knights rose again undaunted beside them and laid healing upon the dying. Their own plight plainly as dire. Over it death came all around upon the ears of Silvermoss, everywhere she saw pandemonium, and its shocking sight in the flare of Imladrisel shivered her company of Woodelves.  <br>
<br>
Now Silvermoss saw the mysterious robed elves made an assault of magicks, great fiery blasts, that shook the Dracoliche. A mighty shock of magical Swords lacerated it, wounding it, and now in every direction she looked a deadly rain of arrows fell on ruined enemy.  Starfire and Moonfire roared, Lightning thundered, the wind howled and the ground rose and broke open in great fissures: Feana must surely be here as well. The magical destruction of Tears of Druzzil seared the black shade of Hatred incarnate and shrivelled a sea of his unworldly disciples. With a terrible chill, Silvermoss realised that here where they stood the entire remainder of the elven people fought, and was dying. <br>
<br>
Just now, some hundreds of shining High Elves were flung horribly asunder from their fighting with one cruel blow from a titanic fisted paw, and lay still never stirring again. Then Windshoal, blinding bright against the vast monstrous dark shape, became revealed in the flare of his sword. <br>
<br>
The others could not reach him.<br>
<br>
That titanic fist of Hate only struck glancing blows against others, for Innorruk battered him with terrible, savage force directly. However armor did not withstand the brutal power of this unnatural being's spite. Silvermoss saw that Windshoal stood ground all broken inside, and yet he fought on, stubbornly refusing quarter.                         <br>
