<br>
Case1: Passing through South wing to get to East.  We pass through the wall and next thing we know our evac is not only missing but shortly thereafter dead.  We find out that he had been summoned to the basement and killed somehow.  No mobs had gated, it was at the beginning of the fight, not sure if he had even casted yet in that particular fight.  CR wasn't that bad but we lost all the time we had just spent getting to East because of some bug.<br>
<br>
Case2: Last night just killing stuff at the zone-in point while we waited for our cleric to arrive.  We were the only group in zone and had only pulled from just inside the doors of a few wings.  Just after our cleric gets there we have 3 mobs pop at zone.  Seemed kind of odd at the time as one of them was even a summoner but we just proceeded to kill them so we could buff up and proceed with moving into the dungeon.  As last skele is about to die it gets it's gate off.  Before we know what's going on we had been summoned 1 by 1 and killed somewhere deeper in zone.  Still not sure exactly where we were killed but think it was in the East wing....which happened to be the only wing we weren't even pulling from.  Then went on to spend the entire evening doing CR and finished up just in time to log off for the night.  Wasted the entire night for everyone in my group and I felt even worse as I had asked all these people to join us on this night.<br>
<br>
Case3:  Undraggable Corpses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &lt;--Happened again last night and 4 times total since we've started going here.  Basically what happens is that your corpse appears where you died but it's undraggable, then it also appears at the zone-in point and is lootable, but not rezzable.  Even had Frizz zone into HS last night (&lt;--first time the GMs actually answered us) and tell us it was perfectly fine before he logged off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Soooo even AFTER the GM checked it we still couldn't do anything with it and had to get it summoned before rezzing.  I just find it hard to believe that this has only happened to us and that the GM's haven't heard about this problem before, or that they would at least have a way to know whether the corpse is truly bugged or not.  Haha when I saw Frizz pop in I was sure we'd FINALLY get help.....NOT!!!<br>
<br>
Has anyone else experienced any of these bugs?  I still love this zone as there are usually only 2 to 3 groups at most here on any given night (if that) and the exp makes Sebilis look like a joke.  These things that happen that are out of your control just get so frustrating sometimes.<br>
<br>
Oh well, 'nuff complaining....I'm sure I'll be back YET AGAIN tonight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now when I go there's usually 2-3 groups there in addition to mine.  Better then Sebilis, sure, but there's also less places to set up shop in HS.<br>
<br>
I still go quite often because the experience in South or East wings is still pretty good, even in 59, but having lived in this zone most of my 50's, have had a couple odd experiences:<br>
<br>
- One time was summoned to an entirely different Wing than the one we were fighting in.  It's been awhile, but I think we were in West, then I see the 'You have been summoned' message and ended up in North.  Died instantly of course and received no help from the GM who responded to my petition.<br>
<br>
- In South wing one time, was pulling mobs through the painting on our way in to the Wing proper, saw 2 mobs on the other side and dropped hide.  Got at LEAST 12 mobs on this pull, more than the entire number of mobs in that section of the wing.  Still dunno where they came from.......<br>
<br>
Overall, though, I've found it very much worth the time invested in getting there and/or in setting up a group to go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unekrotic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nekrotic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/12/01 11:31:08 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fookin buggy Howling Stones...</span><hr size=1> Brask, a couple of comments I hope you find helpful.<br>
<br>
Case 1:  East wing tends to be buggy, in part because of its proximity to South Wing.  Other than going to kill Druscella, there is really no great reason to go to the East wing, exp in the South wing tends to be good enough, but that's just my opinion.  Anyways, lots of bad things happen in East wing, and as you have noticed a lot of it is out of the player's control.<br>
<br>
Case 2:  I don't know if they skelly was agro'd or pulled, but you likely engaged the roaming skelly which comes from the East wing.  If you are doing the zone in, this is the one mob you DO NOT want to pull, for precisely the reasons you gave.  Normally pull just the North, South, and West golems.  Not to mention the trap door on the East staircase that can cause pathing problems with the mobs.<br>
<br>
Case 3: Never had this happen to me, so I don't know what the deal is.  One suggestion though would be to try having a necro summon your corpse, and see if that makes your corpse lootable/rezzable.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.  Howling Stones is a great zone im my experience, tends not to be crowded, mobs have low hps, and exp is good for the most part.<br>

If it happens to you start looking for a necro, the gms WILL NOT help.<br>
<br>
Going back to Case2:  That's what was so strange....we were pulling from every wing EXCEPT East and the mobs that came were while our puller was still out and the rest of the group had not even left the initial zone-in point.  Plus they just &quot;popped&quot; on top of us rather than actually running from one of the wings.  Somehow one of us gained agro, not sure who or how.<br>
<br>
Heh, went back last night to HS again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I don't know exactly what it is about this place, just keeps me coming back for punishment.  I love to do South because of the great loot and solid exp you can get there, but it's still yer basic fight to the camp spot and kill stuff for three hours type of deal.  My favorite is still East though as you get to do the classic dungeon crawl, constantly fighting, constantly moving, and at the end of that long battle you get to take a shot at DS.  We've attempted her 4 times now with one group, successful twice, evac'd twice, but each time we used very different tactics.  First success involved pulling the whole room, chanter mezzes, kill em one by one - pretty basic.  But the second successful attempt was REALLY the fun one......Went in with Warrior, Bard, Wizzie, Shammy, Druid, Rogue and used root, bard CC, and were able to just barely take her out.  Was kinda scarey though at one point looking up at everyone's health and seeing every member of your group down to about 1 bub of red at the same time.  We still lost 2 members on the fight, but the funny thing is it was after DS was dead and we thought we had everything under control.  Haha ok, now I've added a Rave to my Rant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My only advice is if you see some mobs running around acting strange, have everyone in your group camp out and come back real quick to clear agro, some strange things can happen at times. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uslyfingerreborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>slyfingerreborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/12/01 1:54:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fookin buggy Howling Stones...</span><hr size=1> Using the necro spell "summon corpse" is an exploit.You are getting bodies for people without any real danger to yourself.<BR><BR><BR>It could happen.....watch out <p><a href="http://personal.sdf.bellsouth.net/sdf/t/j/tjwork/sly.jpg/"target="_blank"><img src="http://personal.sdf.bellsouth.net/sdf/t/j/tjwork/sly.jpg" border="0"></a><BR>Slyfinger Shadowstealer <BR>

That's impossible ! According to Verant, you have exploited the z-axis. hence nullifying the mob summon ability.  Nope you somehow exploited.
