the only reason i got out of RP in EQ..... i dont think the game allows in itself for pure and hardcore RP. so many morons can mess up a good rp occurance. on one hand having everything scripted and planned isnt roleplay...its acting. true RP is spur of the moment acting at all times as your player would act.<br>
<br>
but then again.....the game itself doesnt allow for true and pure RP. if you dont plan it all out and close off everyone not directly involved...its chaos.<br>
<br>
oh well.....i cant wait for Shadowbane and Horizons....alas the haven's for the great roleplayers will be born!!<br>

Try to level a Troll ShadowKnight on a limit time. One death and there goes a couple of days work...and I used to die alot.<br>
<br>
I found myself logging in and just finding someone to rp with and I wouldn't try and fight anything.<br>
<br>
At least the problem is not the quality or quanity of Roleplaying, but the simple mechanics of the game. Too many simple things that make the game so divorced from the fantasy aspects of the "Grand Verant EQ Vision" (Whatever the Hell that is)<br>
<br>
Plus there are too many damn people...<br>

sorry I didn't offer anything important to say, just ranted and rambled....<br>

While this is realistic, A paladin would attack me, a priest of innoruuk, on sight the one thing the lack of PVP in EQ provides (forces) is the need to RP more story and less actual fighting.  <br>
  <br>
If i were to GM a die based RPG i would plan out all the scenarios ahead of time.  You couldnt sit down and play unless some one was the GM and did this (a gm greating it on the fly, perhaps, but to the players, the scenes are presented none the less) <br>
<br>
If i were to take two groups, one good, one bad, and pit them together for an RP scenario, the first thing i would have to deal with would be how do i keep them from just killing each other in the first encounter?  While in EQ we dont get the option, we cant just kill each other, it does force the RPing factions to work out stories together, like an outline.  Most of the RP story posts either 1) did happen in game and was later embellished and put in story form or 2) a non-game event to push the plot in some way.   (of course there are others but those are most common) <br>
<br>
This is not to say shadow bane will not be good rp, it will probably be better as the whole guild system will force people to participate in at least surface RP of the guild defending its cities and holdings. <br>
<br>
anyway, thats just my 7,892,630 pp worth<br>

At first, I couldn't think of what that might be.  I'm a good video gamer (not great, but not terrible).  I know places to hunt that are level-appropriate.  Of course, I did have to start her over when my bf and I got tired of sharing an account (he had the higher-level character), so that ties into it.  But now I know!  The main reason Zariel is a lowbie (and will stay that way for a good long time) is that I drop everything -- and I mean everything -- for RP.  I have been known to leave groups for it, after explaining what is going on to said group.  People are surprisingly cool about it.<br>
I hate powerleveling.  I have another character who has been powerleveled, because I really needed to get her to 10th.  I was powerleved by a friend, and stopped after one bubble.  (Not one level -- one bubble.)  Why?  It was boring!  Since then, I have gotten exactly one level with her.  Why?  Because I spend all my time playing her, RPing.<br>
I have spent time powerleveling myself -- about an hour all told, and hated every one of those 60 minutes.  <br>
In the end, I don't mind having my primary character be 16th level.  She has friends, enemies, even a daughter.  (And if you think pretending to be pregnant isn't roleplay, think again!)  She has loved, and lost, and loved again.  She has been betrayed by two men.  She is the Ambassador to the Fist of the Five Winds (all-monk guild -- the only reason for an all-monk guild to _exist_ is RP!).  I always have someone to talk to or hang out with when playing EQ.  Some people have even become good friends OOC.<br>
In general, though, I think RP goes downhill when people take it OOC.  We all have feelings, and one can get to feeling so strongly about one's IC friends and enemies that one can take it OOC.  I have never met any of my EQ friends in RL, although one of them lives not far from me in my hometown.  Actually, that person is one of Zariel's most despised enemies IC!  (Hmmm....)<br>
Sometimes it is hard to stay IC, true.  We all have off days.  But lots of my online EQ time is, in fact, spent doing RP, almost always unplanned.  Maybe it's with a friend, maybe over guildchat, maybe with an enemy I run into somewhere.  Maybe it's with a group, hunting.  There is lots of RP, you just have to seek it out.  Sometimes it's tiring and I want to give up.  I can see the joy of being high-level, although I doubt I will ever play a high-level character.  And several people who have deliberately removed themselves from the RP environment of EQ have given me good reasons for their decision.  I just don't happen to agree.<br>
As for Shadowbane, I think it is more likely to attract powergamers than RPers, but we shall see.  I'm someone who has fought about 3 duels, and all with people more than 3 times my level.  All of them were roleplay-based.  (Zariel has a big mouth.)  Obviously, I don't mind dying to another player -- but getting jumped on by 5 or 6 high-levels sounds awful.  I play on a &quot;blue server&quot; specifically to avoid that sort of thing.  I have also turned down duels I could have easily won, because the person gave me no RP reason to duel them.<br>
That's all I have to say on RP for now.  In conclusion, though, I have a question for ya, Morz -- why do you say &quot;alas the havens&quot; etc.?  I thought you would be happy that these so-called havens are coming into existence.  Do you mean &quot;at last&quot;?  &quot;Alas&quot; is a cry of despair, as in &quot;Alas, my back hurts from hunching over my keyboard!&quot;<br>
