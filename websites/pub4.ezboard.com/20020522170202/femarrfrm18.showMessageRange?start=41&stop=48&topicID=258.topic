<br>
I think I did say something remarkably similar to that, actually.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Doesn't sound like you are old enough to have taken part.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neither were you, so by that measure our opinions will be equal. That's nice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep studying your history books and try not to fall prey to yet another 50 cent word - ethnocentrism.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thank you, I will.<br>
<br>
If by ethnocentrism you mean a rascist ideology, then I shall agree wholeheartedly.<br>
<br>
If by ethnocentrism you mean putting America and its true allies first in all matters, then I shall hope to fall prey to such an ideology as frequently as possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Kidin, whats the word for someone who calls other people cowards despite never having their bravery tested?&quot;<br>
<br>
Why don't you just ask, Cendan? Or do snotty comments seem easier?<br>
<br>
As I look at my bookshelf (containing the books you appear to hold in such contempt), I notice a certain bookend. It is an entirely unremarkable piece of wood, a piece of wood which had the distinction of passing through half of my lower left leg at a rather incredible speed. After this amazing journey, it promptly lodged itself into the bone.<br>
<br>
I can only assume that it achieved this speed courtesy of a Soviet surplus landmine, which are common in sub-saharan Africa, where I had the distinct displeasure of spending three years of my life.<br>
<br>
It was not an entirely uninstructive event however, since I learned not only the value of sulfa, but also developed the habit of never wearing a belt that can't double as a tourniquette. It's surprising how difficult it can be, finding a decent belt that meets the requirement.<br>
<br>
Of course, we can swap stories all day, as Nigerian corruption and Orange River tussles are endlessly amusing. There's nothing like a rousing tale of adventure, perhaps about a four hour drive, one thumb on the wheel, the other plugging the hole in someone's chest, to really prove...what exactly?<br>
<br>
I've no doubt in my mind that there are braver men than myself. I know for a fact that there are men with a more impressive bragsheet than mine, thank goodness. Hell, I'll even admit that gunfire pointed in my direction always made me want to shit myself. I've never admitted that before, to anyone.<br>
<br>
I also know the word for someone who makes assumptions about others, and is wrong: mistaken. Do me a favor and stick to frontal attacks, snide comments don't become you.<br>

<br>
Well, I admire your participation in whatever cause you seem to have been involved in.<br>
<br>
I have no contempt for your books, only your attitude about US involvement.  I could make this a long winded post but I usually end up saying the same thing 10 different ways so let me sum it up.<br>
<br>
There is a fine line between American Pride and American Arrogance.  There is also a difference between the pride of accomplishment, and the pride of patting yourself (country included) on the back.<br>
<br>
If, as you seem to state, involvement is expected then where is the room for pride when people are just doing what they should and the opposite is cowardice? <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

I will, however, say a few things. First off, as someone living in the UK, I`m very thankful to the US for wading in and helping when it was needed. Similarly there was mention of Australia, and folks from both Australia and its neighbour New Zealand fought with great distinction in both world wars.<br>
<br>
I always have a soft spot for the Russians, however, especially their tank crews. To know that your main gun will literally bounce off of a german tank and that your only weapon of quality, ramming, will at most make them slip a track for a day or so while it costs you your life...well...they had courage beyond that i could describe.<br>
<br>
I`d like to pass on my thanks to all of them, regardless of where they came from, because after all was said and done, their blood was the same colour and it was all shed for folk such as we. <p><img src="http://geocities.com/martinsteers/tappi.txt">

<br>
If the Germans would of invented the Jet engine on schedule they would of eliminated both my country and prolly most of europe then with the resulting land mass they owned laid waste to the US.<br>
<br>
The German army was formidable and it wasnt only the US army that saved us, so dont go blowing your &quot;We owe you big time trumpet&quot; you idiot.  England held out cos we are an island which is very difficult to attack.  Russia held out cos they are huge and have a harsh winter.<br>
<br>
Prehaps you should take a more objective opinion and reliase how close Germany (and Europe) were to the Atom bomb, Openheimer wasnt so far advanced as you may think. <br>

One of the quotes in the conclusions is<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
There are many other factors that explain victory and defeat beside von Ribbentrop's trio. Yet without Soviet resistance and reform, American rearmament and economic mobilisation, and western air power, the ability of the three major allies to wear down German and Japanese resistance would have been highly questionable. This still leaves open the question of German miscalculation. There were weaknesses and strengths in Hitler's strategy, but no misjudgements were more costly in the end than the German belief that the Red Army was a primitive force, incapable of prolonged resistance, or Hitler's insistence that the USA would take years to rearm and could never field an effective army, or the failure to recognise that bombing was a threat worth taking seriously before it was too late. Military arrogance and political hubris put Germany on the path to a war she could have won only if these expectations had proved true.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The overall site is very good.  It talks about different aspects of the war.  Like Pearl Harbor was a big screw up for the US since the intelligence was there, but not taken seriously.  Also, Japan was trying to knock us out of the war long enough to expand, which they did.<br>
<br>
With reguards to the German research into the atomic bomb, they were not close.  Heisenburg started out with a simple 1D calculation and came up with a result that implied you would need tons of plutonium or uranium.  (I don't recall the exact calculation.)  So he didn't think it would realiztically work.  There is unconfirmed reports that he sabatogued the effort, but it is not clear whether he did or didn't.<br>
<br>
From what I have gathered, the US was an important part of the war.  We supplied the allied countries with resources that were badly needed.  But overall it was a team effort.  It is like arguing whether the quarterback or a blocker is more important in American football.  All the Allied countries put forth a huge effort and all derserve the same recognition for their parts.<br>

We were the so called &quot;Arsenal of Freedom.&quot; Our simple ability to mass produce large quantities of equipment, ordinance, etc. and get it where it was needed and to WHO needed it was our largest contribution to winning WWII and the defeat of both Germany and Japan. This is not to diminsh the American troops efforts on land, sea and air, we did have our impact there particularly on the seaside of things. Fielding a large and succesful navy in two large oceans helped the allied cause tremendously but, lets face it despite the good personel we had on the ground our equipment was substandard to Geramany and England's mechanized capabilities, we just had hella more of it and the personal to use it all. prior to our formal entry into WWII we supplied both England and the USSR with material to fight the war, we &quot;sent&quot; volunteers to England and China to assist in the war effort and by the way to get expirence for our own personal for when we did eventually enter the war.<br>
<br>
 <br>
I mean this as no disrepect to any of the fighting men who engaged in ground, sea, or air but it is America's logistical support that had our greatest impact on the war effort.
