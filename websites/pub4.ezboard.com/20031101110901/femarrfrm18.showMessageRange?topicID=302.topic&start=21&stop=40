ROFLMAO! Brutas, you are great!<br>
<br>
You know, I have no problem with positive affirmations delivered by a minister, priest, rabbi, or monk. However, this thread began with an arrogant Christian presentation that happens in real life all too often. I can't tell you how many times I heard prayers at high school football games that involved statements such as "This country has sinned against you Father" and then "forgive us, in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit" achoo.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, most religious fanatics, when given the soap box of public prayer, use it all to often to deliver a sermon. I don't want to hear the sermon. If others do then let them go to church on Sunday. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/25/02 10:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Simple, Clear and Poweful</span><hr size=1> /nod Lurikeen,<br>

     I dislike those persons who are loud and intrusive in proclaining thier faith (any faith). It just rings hollow to me somehow, I don't think it is arrogance, I think it is that they are trying to convince themselves as much as you, if you know what I mean. As I stated before, I am catholic and probably not a very good one (don't care much for sermons and would rather be in the woods with God than in a building). I however find much comfort in the catholic teachings as they have allowed me a relationship with God. That being said, I have great respect for eastern religions, because they are so unassuming in thier presentation. Many Christain denominations are loud in thier efforts of &quot;witnessing&quot;. To me &quot;witnessing&quot; means just living your own life according to your faith and let someone witness you doing so and if they are moved by the way you live perhaps they can ask you about it. Not much more than that if you ask me.<br>
<br>

I still honestly do not see the difference between a Military Chaplin, a Police Chaplin or a Congressional Chaplin though. They all serve this nation, have responsibilty to the public at large and will eventually come across an ethical dilema of some sort. <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/27/02 7:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Simple, Clear and Poweful</span><hr size=1> Oooooooo I love the lake!!

From a Christian perspective, one would simply not want to 'hear' the truth.<br>
<br>
Many religions over the decades have gripped about the same but in reverse. Many didn't, and still dont, want porn and all the bad junk in society influencing them and their children. But has that stopped the porn / Hollywood industry? Not.<br>
<br>
My point is this and its simple... Regardless of what 'spin' or liberal twist one applies to the constitution, we all have a RIGHT to worship and we all have a RIGHT to free speech and self-expression. But what we do not have a right to.. is to not hear what we dont want or like….So… All those ‘bible-thumpers’ are thumping under their constitutional rights. All the complainers are complaining under their own personal assumptions of what they perceive as ‘personal space’. <br>
<br>
Now that we have established that we can revisit “Do you believe in God?” hehe<br>

<br>
To respond to your second request, I think Brutas came pretty close with the below quote in regards to 'what religion should be worshiped'. Or rather, what is an acceptable religion to worship in the US.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Generalities such as love, truth, discipline, empathy etc….. are acceptable in my opinion. The above ’prayer’ brings attention to some very neglected issues. The prayer has a positive intention however it does get a little too descriptive for the Non-Christian..... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think that more attention needs to be given to what constitutes a religion....an 'acceptable religion to be worshiped'. Any modern religion that requires the sacrifice of humans or animals should not be allowed or accepted as a religion IMO. <br>
<br>
As for your first request...the government should not sponsor any form of religion. However, every citizen should be free to worship an acceptable religion anywhere....on private property or state property and be able to vocalize it. Obviously one cannot burst out in class and begin to worship causing a disturbance.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes, Brutas does make a compelling point. So let's substitute "Satanism" with the Wiccan religion which is regarded as very peacefull and loving. Make a difference?<br>
<br>
Also, I find it difficult to accept the phrase "acceptable religion in the US". What counts as "acceptable"? For instance, I do not find the attrocities or laws spelled out in the Old Testament at all acceptable and wouldn't want my children to be taught they are OK because God said so.<br>
<br>
I also don't find the story of Christ's death acceptable as told in the New Testament. I surely don't want my children to have to read that violent tale.<br>
<br>
I suppose we could claim that the "majority religion" is acceptable, but the counter argument is if Satanism was the "majority" religion, then would it truly be acceptable?<br>
<br>
<i>"...and be able to vocalize it."</i><br>
<br>
Truly, that is not the issue. What is the issue is when those in public power over others vocalize their religious beliefs. That is an abuse of power and counts as a "sponsored religion". It is the holding up of one religion over all others from a position of public power that is wrong and is not constitutional. Such actions are no longer the domain of free speech but become an abuse of power. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uquath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/28/02 10:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Simple, Clear and Poweful</span><hr size=1> Here are a few prayers I dug up after a quick search.

I would agree with Lurikeen about the Old Testament.  How do you explain to a child stories like passover.  You have to explain it is ok for God to murder children because he didn't like the Pharaoh's attitude.  Of course, a preacher would try to dress up such a prayer as a reason for us to be humble and search for God's meaning.  But it is still a sick story to pass on to children.<br>

I can see where your coming from.. If my elected representative, which I have given limited authority over me, were to spout out a bunch of satanic gibberish, I would vote against him.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I have read many accounts of Wiccan worship... Im not sure if I know the full scoop on that religion....some say Its 'black magic'  others 'white magic' and then some say its the worship of the earth much like several Native American tribes...?  I dunno, but whatever the case... its seems very diverse and inconsistent.<br>
<br>
To the believer, the 'tale' of Christ is a historical account... like WWII. Obviously the non-believer would see it as a 'tale'. Either way it does not negate the fact that it is a religion...one accepted by society.<br>
<br>
We live by morality codes. Most of these codes originate from the bible. Satanism flows against many many of the morality codes we follow today. I can hardly see it or any spin-off as acceptable.<br>

Rheaton, our founding Fathers made a strong effort to write and enact laws they believed to be "common sense", as Thomas Paine put it.

<br>
I have seen several variations of Satanism.  They are quite interesting.<br>
<br>
1 - Sterotypical Satanism.  It has the sacrafices and demon worship.  I think this is mostly Hollywood media and rebellious teenagers.<br>
2 - Tough Philosophy version.  It is a dog eat dog world and the meek do not inherient the earth.  Basically survival of the fittest and take no crap from anyone.<br>
3 - Social Club.  People that really don't believe in consequences for their actions.  They could be atheist or theist.  They believe in enjoying this life and not worrying about an afterlife.<br>
4 - Luciferean - Not 100 per cent sure about this.  I think they believe that Old Testament and Greek Mythology are linked.  So Lucifer would be equivalent to Prometheus.  (Lot of the stories are similar.)  Prometheus symbolized integrity and helping humanity while Zeus (God) was just an arrogant dictator.<br>
<br>
There are probably a few other categories.  These are just a few of the ones I have seen.  Probably as many variations on Satanism as there are in Christianity (Mormon, Prodestant, Catholic, Babptist, Methodist, Penecostal, etc.).<br>
<br>
I typically find that people's morality is loosly based on their religion.  Religion seems to determine what rituals they should follow.  I think in any religion you will find kind, nice, honerable people and you will also find some of the worst scoundrels.<br>

I worked in a jail for two years and the number of religions I have seen is quite frankly stupid.  I have seen &quot;Hail Bubba&quot; religion where it is required that all meals are steak. Inmates will literally make up a new religion to try and get something over on the system and have something to sue for when thier requests are denied. Many religions real or made up are simply not doable in a jail/prison population for monetary and safety reasons. Examples, beards are a security risk, I am sure the taxpayer doesn't want to foot the bill for steak for prisoners either, etc. There are rules in jails/prisons and freedom of religon does not supercede safety.<br>
<br>
What does all this have to do with the general public? Well, we have laws in society and I think freedom of religion is and should draw the line at these laws. To me that is what determines what is and is not acceptable.<br>

I agree for the most part.  However, instead of laws, I think it should based on not infringing other people's rights.  For example, Philadelphia had a law prohibiting bathing more than once a month.  This is a pure morality law that is not based on infringement of rights.  I would say religions should be able to break such laws.  (I would really go further and say such laws should not exist.)<br>
<br>
There are grey areas where rights conflict.  Like my right to go nude may interfere with your right to not see nudity.  However, these can typically be solved in a diplomatic manner.  (e.g. Nudism at home or certain restricted areas)<br>

<i>"Sect. II. We the General Assembly of Virginia do enact that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever..."</i><br>
<br>
No person can be compelled to worship or support particular types of whorship. A Public Servant such as a school principle vocalizing prayers over the school's PA system is a form of intimidation over those who don't bow their heads in prayer with the public authority. It is an abuse of public power and is not thereby protected by the constitution.<br>
<br>
<i>"...but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities."</i><br>
<br>
Public servants my freely profess their faith and defend their faith if necessary. Doing so should not be the basis of discrimination against them.<br>
<br>
A Public Servant such as a school principle should not be fired for telling a colleague "I am a Baptist", or fired for explaining his/her faith if asked by a student.<br>

<i>"Well the govenrment already decides what is and isn't an acceptable religion in case you did not know."</i><br>
<br>
Completely true. I remember in the 1980s the "Zion Coptic Church" of Miami suing the State of Florida over drug busts, because according to them smoking weed was their religion. The so-called "church" lost. hehehe<br>
<br>

<i>"However, instead of laws, I think it should based on not infringing other people's rights."</i><br>
<br>
The problem is with what we mean by "rights". In a democracy, <i>liberty</i> means that everyone has certain rights that can't be taken away by a majority. In the US those <i>rights</i> are defined by the "Bill of Rights". Essentially, it is the Bill of Rights in the US that defines what counts as a "just claim" against others (including the government).<br>
<br>
Legislated morality laws will stay on the books just so long as there is nothing that indicates a violation of judicial interpretation of the Bill of Rights. What that means is that if my city has a law forbidding my running naked through city streets, then I have no right to do so unless I can prove in a court that the law unjustly infringes upon my civil liberties as granted through the Bill of Rights. In short, I would have to prove that public nudity is protected, for example.<br>

This is the tough spot. The ninth amendment was added to protect the citizens from the government taking away liberties that were not listed in the first 8 amendments. So far the 9th amendment has only been loosely used to support provacy in marriage. However, I think it should be broadened to support other basic rights that were not listed (e.g. right to die, right to marry whomever you wish, right to bathe). Unfortunately, this usually just boils down to the current morality of the judicial system.<br>

My thoughts on prayer in school: I don't approve of it. When I was 7 years old, I was visiting the US, and went to school there for some months. Every day, I was required to stand up and sing the national anthem of, and swear allegience to the flag of, a country which was not my own.<br>
<br>
Back in Australia, in a government school, we had some kind of &quot;religious education&quot; which all but one of the kids in my year attended. There may have been separate classes for Catholics and Protestants, I'm not sure. The one child who spent that time of the day in the library was Buddhist, and did not attend at his parent's request, but I'm sure he felt quite isolated by the process. My family was not religious, and that's probably the same for many others, but there was a pressure to attend anyway. Small children are easily influenced like that. I know I felt uncomfortable about both situations, but wasn't prepared to do anything about it. I'm sure that technically it wasn't the case, but in reality, the prayers and bible of a faith I did not believe in were being forced apon me. Children in schools should be allowed to pray in their chosen way, but not have others prayers forced apon them. I'm not sure how to do this fairly, but reading prayers over the school intercom would not be the way to do it.<br>
<br>
I attended a private high school run by the Uniting Church. I have no problems with the school chaplain, or mandated prayers, there. I actually found the chaplain to be quite open-minded and reasonable in his views on other religions. There was greek orthodox iconography and a jewish menorah in the chapel. I was kinda miffed about the detention I received for &quot;incessant chatter during worship&quot;. As I recall it I was talking whilst they were reading out the sports results in school assembly... then again, sport was almost a form of worship at that school <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Religion in government? I don't think it belongs there (in most countries). I don't have a problem with individual parlimentarians saying their prayers as they wish. I'm a little more dubious, but still can see reason in them having a chaplain - but that should probably be accounted to their expenses, rather than directly state funded. A parlimentary chapel? Umm.. unless you're very careful that can get to be discriminatory. And politicians need to be very careful making statements that praise, thank, or otherwise refer to God or religion. Even though they may be personal beliefs, you don't want to get personal beliefs mixed up with public or official opinions. It's my opinion that in taking up political positions, you assume certain responsibilities, and one of those is not to let your personal opinions cloud your public stance and image. Fred Nile is an Australian politician who runs a right-wing christian party. Much as I dislike his stance on many issues, I'll allow that it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be based on religious issues, since that's his election platform. The prime minister, John Howard, is also a right-wing christian, but I don't think it's appropriate for him to make decisions based on religion. <p>----------------------------------<br>

Although some people do wear their religion like a hat, isn’t religion something that you take and have with you 24/7? There are two very familiar signs we see today...one is No Smoking and the other is No Concealed Weapons... What’s next, an R in a circle with a slash through it?<br>
<br>
In America, we elect our representatives based upon how well we think they will represent us. If we are conservative Christian, then we vote for thus...Likewise if one is liberal atheist...That’s the beauty of a democracy. We get to vote for those whom (we hope) will have our best interest in mind and heart, but all the while maintaining our rights.<br>
<br>
An atheist may very well think that a prayer before a meeting is uncalled for, while a Christian may think that not praying before a meeting is wrong. The solution is, according to constitutional rights, is not to cease all religion based upon some personal technicality, but to be able to freely exercise your personal beliefs. Your not ramming atheism down my throat by not praying before a meeting any more then a Christian does by praying before a meeting.<br>
<br>
There has to be 'morals' in law. There are many 'moral' laws that we can all agree with already that no one would want to change. Can anyone think of a few? These are more then &quot;common sense&quot; laws..Why is murder and stealing a crime? Why is bestiality and statutory rape a crime? If we dig deep enough into these laws I think we will find morality.<br>
<br>
As far as prayer over the schools PA system, I am not for it. The reason is that I do not want my children to be 'pressured' into praying to a god that I do not approve of. Yes, right now Christianity is the majority, but what if a different religion comes along some day and replaces it? I do not want my children praying to some bogus, false god or even participating in and attending a school that promotes what I may consider a bogus or false religion. However, at the same time I do not want my children to have to leave their religion and beliefs at the door. A truly free person can take their beliefs with them anywhere they go..be it a school, Wal-Mart, the senate or at home. A liberal dissection of the constitution based upon a Supreme Court ruling that all but removes our rights to religion in an state sponsored or state funded facility should be a slap in the face to us all! Even those who do not like to hear God's word or do not like 'bible thumpers' pushing their beliefs in our faces should be proud that that person has a right to and is exercising their constitutional rights.<br>
<br>
I think all will agree that there is much garbage on TV nowadays. There is alot of crap we do not want our children to watch and see. How do we fix it? We turn off the TV. Boycott it if you will by not watching it, but to demand that TVs not be sold or that an artist may not exercise their right to self-expression cause we live in the 'sticks' and can only get one station is unconstitutional. Right? I know some will say there is a difference between having control of a TV set and being approached in public where you cant just 'turn off the Christian' and there is some truth to that. ..But the issue isn’t personal 'space' or personal censorship as much as it is about inalienable constitutional rights.<br>
