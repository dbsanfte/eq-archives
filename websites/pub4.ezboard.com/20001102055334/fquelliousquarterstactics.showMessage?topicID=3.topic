I have partaked in many, so know how it should be done. There are a few ways to do it. The easist way is the plain old gettin 50 people and just take em out head first(simple, and has seemed to work in the past).  <BR>  <BR> A safer way to do it(takes lots of planin this way and at least 30+ total people of no less then lev 48)-  <BR>  <BR> WAVE I  <BR> FIRST OFF make sure all are bound in the same place, city wise that is(find out later) then, organize before goin in(as in groups, MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF BUFFS(this means you clerics, go at it). Ideal would be to have at least 4-6+(even 10 would be great) trolls, ogres, barbarians to take most of the hits. Back them up by bout the same number of clerics to do the healing(the more the marrier, cause, obviously They will be taken the brunt of the force, so, heal em up as much as possible)K, now send them in to attack first, so Whoever your fightin gets pretty pissed at them, so theyare first on the &quot;TO KILL LIST&quot;  <BR>  <BR> MY PICKS  <BR> ALL AVAILABLE OGRES AND TROLLS, if not a total of at least 6 of em, then add BARBARIANS to get to bout 8 or 9(1 bard for every 5 here also if you can spare em, to play there music to help em heal and attack faster, but ONLY IF YOU CAN SPARE EM, they are needed in the rear) make sure they are buffed to take hits(high hp, good magic, posion, heat, cold resistance etc, etc..)  ALSO-- pets can go in first, that way they can take a lot of hits, and not be missed if killed with all the clerics behind, healin em.  <BR>  <BR> WAVE II  <BR> THEN- this is where you send in the majority of melees in just a second or two behind the first wave.  Paladins, Warriors(non trolls, ogres etc, etc of course,), Bards(not all, explain later) rogues(obviously send in behind for backstab), etc, etc... This will help inflict lots of damage, back up the tanks, that sort of stuff. You will want this to consist of at least 10 or more players(15 of more to be safer)  <BR>  <BR> MY PICKS  <BR> 5+ WARRIORS and MONKS(dwarfs, humans, etc, for hard hittin)  <BR> 2+ ROGUES(any race is great, do the backstabin)  <BR> 1-2 BARDS(for the damage, no more then this though,keep most behind, not to far though) and then all other melee classes, that arent magic users to get the count to at 15+  <BR>  <BR> WAVE III  <BR> This is the last row of people, the magic users!!!!  <BR> This is the blunt of the hits that should be inflicted to the god, dragon, etc.  <BR>  <BR> MY PICKS  <BR> 5+ Wizards(OBVIOUSLY, for the awsome direct damage spells, ice comet and the such)  <BR> 5+ Necro's and Magicians(awsome spells, and there pets can be very valuable tanks)  <BR> AS MANY CLERICS AS POSSIBLE!! for the healing, duhhh(but not all, explain later)  <BR> AS MANY BARDS AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE, bards are so under rated, at least 5-10 should be back there, but not usually that many available unfortunalty. no one nows there true value(After i got to level 50 with my paldin, i started one up right away, and at level 16, i know now that they are one of, and arguable, the best class in the game), no one realizes how powerful they are. You will want em back there at least 1 for every 5 heavy casters, playin there mana songs, healin em up. All others should be close a nuff to the melee'en to be able to effect the warriors and such with there songs(with instruments in hand to increase the effects)  <BR>  <BR> And all other magic users that have good damage spells  <BR>  <BR> NOW, the clerics are second most important only to the bards, if not just as important. for there healinand buffs. but, you will want to keep 2 or so out of the fightin zone, and in the closest city zone, where EVERYONE SHOULD BE BOUND, EVEN MAGIC USERS THAT CAN BE BOUND CLOSE TO THE FIGHTIN, DONT, BIND YOURSELF IN THE CITY ZONE, IN THE SAME SPOT WITH EVERYONE ELSE. why, so if someone so happens to get killed(which will happen, a lot) they can be resurected right back to the corpse, and fighin. and of course, if clerics arent available, other classes have reseruct. also, keep em in groups, in case somethin goes wrong, they can port everyone back to the same spot.  <BR>  <BR> NOW, this will help kill em efficiently, and easily every time, but will take lots of time and planin to get it right(plan ahead of time so that you can get the right amount of players on at the same time)  <BR>  <BR> Also, might want to keep a group or 2 back to protect the back row against other monsters that might stray close by and attack.  <BR>  <BR> There are a lot of classes that where not listed, all are valuable( just listed the most important to have ones were listed), place em where you think they belong.for example, with the hybrid classes, you got 2 paladins, one played to get good strength, and great for attackin, send em in with the 2nd wave to attack, the other pal concentrated on inteligince and magic using abilities, keep em behind to help back there. and same with other hybrid classes.  <BR>  <BR> THIS IS A GREAT PLAN OF ACTION AND HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFICIENT WHEN PERFORMED CORRECTLY. BUT, I CAN NOT REPEAT IT ENOUGH, TAKES A LOT OF PLANIN TO DO. AND RELIES SOME WHAT ON LUCK OF WHOS AVAILABLE, AND WHATS AROUND THERE.  <BR>  <BR> MAY SOUND WIERD, BUT, THE AMOUNT OF BARDS AND CLERICS CAN MAKE OR BREAK THE BATTLE THE MORE THERE ARE, THE BETTER OFF, THE LESS, THE MORE DIFFICULT TIME YOU WILL ENCOUNTER. THIS IS SO VERY TRUE, YOU CAN HAVE A GROUP OF 12 PEOPLE FIGHTIN SOMETHING, 4BARDS, 4CLERICS AND 6 OTHER MELEE'ERS WILL HAVE A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER CHANCE THE SAY 2BARDS, 2CLERICS, AND 8OTHER CLASSES.  <BR>  <BR> THE UNARGUABLY MOST POWERFUL FULL GROUP OF 6 IN THE GAME WOULD BE 6 LEV 50 BARDS(IN A 6 ON 6 DUEL AGAINST ANOTHER SINGLE CLASS GROUP OF 6 THAT IS, THE BARDS ARE COMPLETELY WITH OUT A DOUBT UN BEATABLE) AND YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY OTHER WISE, YOUR PRETTY IGNERANT, AND GO AHEAD AND FIND A FULL GROUP OF 6 LEV 50 BARDS AND CHALLANGE THEM, SEE HOW FAST THEY TAKE YOU DOWN. GO AHEAD AND START ONE OUT, ONCE YOU GET HIGH, YOU WILL SEE HOW VALUABLE THEY ARE IN GROUPS AND DRAGON/GOD SLAYIN  <BR>  <BR> well, use wisely(Kinda like the good old days of buildin magic decks, its bout nowin wich cards are the best to play, and which are the best to keep back to help out the ones in play)  <BR>  <BR> Xand Del'ril  <BR> Lev 50th Paladin  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Noruas <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/4/00 10:10:31 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> several good points... but several bad points. <BR>  <BR> pets should never go first..  <BR> you've got to treat pets like rogues. they will do immense damage over long periods of time if you keep them alive... pets will stay alive longer if they don't go in first, and since its very difficult to keep an eye on each pet's health during battle, they should be saved for WAVE III.  <BR>  <BR> there seems to be a pretty sonsistant method throughout the servers on how to fight single large mobs... dragons.. solo gods.. etc.  <BR>  <BR> wave I  <BR> get about 2 uber tank groups. that is, in each wave I group.. include 3 uber tanks, 1 bard, 2 clerics.  these two groups will be taking damage throughout the battle... its imperative that they stay alive as long as possible..  <BR>  <BR> wave II  <BR> there aught to be 1 or 2 wave II groups, consisting of the rangers\rogues. secondary melee classes with low hp\ac. but high damage. these groups should be similar to wave I. with apropriate healers\bards.  <BR>  <BR> wave III <BR> should be the pet owners, and nukers.run into melee range, and nuke till it hurts. *important note for you casters... do not die with mana... heh :)  <BR>  <BR> this setup will generally kill just about any large mob in the game. solo that is. <BR>  <BR> but i believe the question is, how in hate do you clear effectively to get meastro, and innoruuk solo?  <BR>  <BR> i've been with a group of folks that has done it a few times... but it has taken us around 10 - 14 hours from start to finish... i'd like to see this done in 6 hours.. becuase that is far too much time. :)  <BR>  <BR> -noruas  <BR> fennin ro  <BR>  <BR> Gospadin   <BR> Global user <BR> (1/5/00 3:46:36 am) <BR> Reply <BR> nothing in this game requires waves <BR>  <BR> there is nothing in the game that requires waves upon waves of people.  <BR>  <BR> A skilled group of 24 can kill any monster in the game. Try playing with 24 instead of 40. The decrease in lag means that clerics will actually be able to heal in time, etc.  <BR>  <BR> Throwing 50 people at a god is stupid.  <BR>  <BR> In order of difficulty with 24:  <BR>  <BR> Innoruuk  <BR> Lord Nagafen  <BR> Cazic Thule  <BR> Dracolich  <BR> Lady Vox  <BR>  <BR> 24 people who work well together can do vox and nag, start to finish (at beginning of giants) in about 90 minutes.  <BR>  <BR> PoH takes about 12-14 hours.  <BR>  <BR> PoF takes about 8-9.  <BR>  <BR> I'm sure they can be done faster, this is how long we took last time we did 'em.  <BR> --Gospadin, Afterlife, Mithanial Marr  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Beltzer   <BR> Administrator <BR> (1/5/00 6:03:16 am) <BR> Reply <BR> Thanks for that info <BR>  <BR> But, the main topic was meant to be the strategy for getting yourself located into the PoH and starting to kick ass.  <BR>  <BR> My number one main concerns are:  <BR>  <BR> 1) How many people are ideal for efficient clearing of roaming mobs, and which way can it be best achieved.  <BR>  <BR> 2) I have used the technique of pulling to the SW corner, and am looking on refinements to it, so that we don't get uber trains. Anyone know how these happen?  <BR>  <BR> 3) I have seen groups pulling to the NE corner, having not done this, I was wondering how getting yourself set up in that corner was achieved.  <BR>  <BR> 4) Order of clearing. With the insanely fast respawn of roamers, you have to take care of them and then move on to a building to clear it. Which buildings must be cleared for a safer pull of the Maestro.  <BR>  <BR> 5) How do you actually pull the Maestro, do you have to clear out the main room first, or can you attempt to pull him using the standard monk chain pull technique?  <BR>  <BR> 6) Once Maestro is clear, how then do you proceed? Do you have to clear the zone before killing Innoruuk or can you just go straight on up there?  <BR>  <BR> 7) How do you go about pulling Innoruuk in the safest possible way?  <BR>  <BR> 8) Do you need a monk, or rather, what are teh minimum requirements for starting a Plane of Hate raid? <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Xand Delril <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/5/00 6:14:53 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> True with pets <BR>  <BR> very true, pets should be sent in with a later wave. but, i would still advise sendin 1 or 2 in first to do lots of damage, and that way if you need to get the heck out of the place, you can run and have your pets stay there to distract who ever it is your fightin. Pets are valuable, but they are expandible, not like players. Id rather have my necro's pet dyin raher then my necro dyin <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Xailei Shiv <BR> Global user <BR> (1/5/00 6:48:07 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> Re: efficient stratagy <BR>  <BR> A very important thing you guys are forgetting to mention is the effect of dragon roar on pets. I used my necro on the last dragon raid and never again will I. I stood way back to avoid the AoE and what I saw was very sad. All the pets would go in for the attack then get feared and run. Right about when they would get back from being feared they would get hit with the next pulse of dragon roar and all run again.  Vox was also completely immune to my life tap and bond of death making my spells utterly useless on dragons. The only spell that the necros could get to stick on Vox is ignite blood. <BR>  <BR> Smegal <BR> Global user <BR> (1/6/00 2:02:26 am) <BR> Reply <BR> Re: efficient stratagy <BR> On a recent dragon raid one of our members kept their log running the entire time. In the end here is how it broke down.  <BR>  <BR> Monks  <BR> Rouges  <BR> Necro pets  <BR> Warriors  <BR> Rangers  <BR> Sk's  <BR> Pallies  <BR> Bards  <BR>  <BR> If you combine the damage of the pet and the damage the necro manages to get through you will find that the Necros probably dish out more total damage during the fight than anyone else.  <BR>  <BR> Also you will notice lots of tanks getting feared. The difference between a winning raid and a loosing one is group make up and proper gear. Caster heavy groups are gonna have real problems. Groups with only 60 or 70 cold resist or gonna get eaten alive by vox. Groups with no ogre/troll/barb/Pally/Sk's bash/slamming are gonna have vox CH herself. And the perfect number for dragons is 24. 30 is ok but you start getting linkdeaths...  <BR>  <BR> Smegal BoneMender - Afterlife, Mith Marr server <BR>  <BR> Ainamar Psycho Cleric   <BR> Global user <BR> (1/6/00 2:58:03 am) <BR> Reply <BR> Answers <BR>  <BR> 1) How many people are ideal for efficient clearing of roaming mobs, and which way can it be best achieved.  <BR>  <BR> I would say about 30 people is good for clearing, but that is a very flexible number. It took us about 12 hours to clear enough of hate to get to Innoruuk, but that's with alot of trains and hours of reviving/rebuffing.  <BR>  <BR> 2) I have used the technique of pulling to the SW corner, and am looking on refinements to it, so that we don't get uber trains. Anyone know how these happen?  <BR>  <BR> We found the main causes of trains in the SW corner was when people got up on the wall or any mobs go up there. The key is just to have everybody on the ground, and when fighting face towards the house infront of you so that you dont push the mob up the wall. I believe directly above the SW corner is a cleric hall and if you get to high up there, expect a few clerics and other stuff to be on their way.  <BR>  <BR> 3) I have seen groups pulling to the NE corner, having not done this, I was wondering how getting yourself set up in that corner was achieved.  <BR>  <BR> Death trap  <BR>  <BR> 4) Order of clearing. With the insanely fast respawn of roamers, you have to take care of them and then move on to a building to clear it. Which buildings must be cleared for a safer pull of the Maestro.  <BR>  <BR> I'd say all the buildings remotely close to the pulling path???  <BR>  <BR> 5) How do you actually pull the Maestro, do you have to clear out the main room first, or can you attempt to pull him using the standard monk chain pull technique?  <BR>  <BR> Sorry I dont pull, I just heal :P <BR>  <BR> 6) Once Maestro is clear, how then do you proceed? Do you have to clear the zone before killing Innoruuk or can you just go straight on up there?  <BR>  <BR> I hear lots of people saying that you have to clear the whole zone, but when we killed Innoruuk we only pulled what was in the way, and after killing Innoruuk we stayed in his hallway for quite a bit of time without any problems.  <BR>  <BR> 7) How do you go about pulling Innoruuk in the safest possible way?  <BR>  <BR> YOU DONT!!! You move your whole group to him <BR>  <BR> 8) Do you need a monk, or rather, what are the minimum requirements for starting a Plane of Hate raid?  <BR>  <BR> You need a monk so you can bail out of bad pulls, we did poh with a monk, a non-agro cleric and a couple non-agro enchanters, no battle enchanters (it would have been alot easier if we had them), alot of tanks and alot of clerics.  <BR>  <BR> Also somebody mentioned the difficulty of the gods/dragons.....I and many others on my server have viewed it much differently. In the actual one on one fight from hardest to easiest i would have to say:  <BR>  <BR> Dracholiche  <BR> Maestro  <BR> Lord Nagafen  <BR> Lady Vox  <BR> Cazic Thule  <BR> Innoruuk  <BR>  <BR> The whole fight in getting to them from hardest to easiest however:  <BR>  <BR> Innoruuk  <BR> Cazic Thule  <BR> Maestro  <BR> Dracoliche  <BR> Lord Nagafen  <BR> Lady Vox  <BR>  <BR> Ainamar  <BR> Level 50 Cleric of Prexus  <BR>  <BR> Eridani   <BR> Global user <BR> (1/6/00 8:47:24 am) <BR> Reply <BR> I'm not sure.. <BR>  <BR> Plane of Hate and Maestro/Innoruuk have been quite easy for us on Brell Serilis. Clearing everything?  With any good pull team its quite easy to break Hate, it just takes time. We have 2 VERY experiences monks that can do this, with the help of any # of rangers druids and enchanters. Single pulls, double pulls, heck..even triple and quad+ are easily pulled and killed. Maybe it's just easy for us because the groups that do this work extremely well with each other. Maestro? Not hard. Sure people die, but that happens always in a major mob fight. He seems to have an instant death type song that just zaps one or two people..who knows. Innoruuk? VERY easy, seemed more like a carnival ride than killing a god.  <BR> Hack and slash, all you need to do to him. Sure it might have been the # of pets we had in against him..but it wasnt hard at all. 4 people died, all do death touches.  How its done you ask? Well..for a while we had a cleric (myself actually) that wasnt playing much due to RL reasons constantly camped out in the SW corner. I'd jump on to res everyone that zoned in and died from that damn Spite Golem, or dueled and had their corpses dragged by non-kos people in wolf form.  Once at the SW corner and buffed, let the pulling begin. Once the cleric temple is pulled, move up to the next staging point in the temple near the throne, and clear to Maestro. Then walk up and beat Maestro down, then go back to the throne. Pull everything near the spire up, and up top, then move up the spire and clear to Inno. Then buff up and wait for Inno to come near you at the top of the spire. Run in and have the time of your life with his Gravity Fluxes =) It's fun, easy, and almost good loot heh. Quite funny actually, Brell being one of the first servers to kill Innoruuk..we hadn't even killed a dragon or broken into Fear before we killed him. Although the last week has been spent in Fear keeping it clean of nasty mobs (Cazic nor Draco have made an appearance) and we took down Vox last night *puts on his nifty see invis eyepatch* and Phinagel died tonight. Brell is on its way to dominating it all, and it's a great time to be on there.  <BR>  <BR> Take care.  <BR> Eridani Pryde  <BR> lvl 50 cleric with see invis  <BR> Brell Serilis <BR>  <BR> inigo withani <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/6/00 4:18:58 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> from the land of bristlebane... <BR>  <BR> First off, nice job getting this discussion going. It is nice to read how others do things. While we (on BB) have little trouble with Hate, Fear absolutely ruins us quite often. I'll go read that discussion later...  <BR>  <BR> Anyway, with all the server crashes lately, we have had alot of practice killing Innoruuk. Just some stats (not a pissing contest) We have killed Inno 4 times in last 2 weeks. From break in to gate out, the event usually takes 5-7 hours. So, here are my replies to your questions...  <BR>  <BR> 1) How many people are ideal for efficient clearing of roaming mobs, and which way can it be best achieved.  <BR> - We bring 30-36. Any more than this and lag is rediculous. Of the 36, we always have at least 2 or 3 enchanters. They save us everytime. Enchanters with a cleric dedicated to each enchanter is a good method. This group can chew up and spit out a pull of 6 mobs on occasion.  <BR>  <BR> 2) I have used the technique of pulling to the SW corner, and am looking on refinements to it, so that we don't get uber trains. Anyone know how these happen? <BR>  <BR> -Im a wizard and have no sense direction, SW corner means nothing to me ;) We fight where we zone in. We average one to two &quot;death trains&quot; per raid. Only way to avoid this is to break into Verant and fix the pathing code yourself :) <BR>  <BR> 3) I have seen groups pulling to the NE corner, having not done this, I was wondering how getting yourself set up in that corner was achieved.  <BR>  <BR> - Again with directions! If you want to go fight elsewhere (besides the zone in area) just have everyone die and get dragged by non-KOS people. <BR>  <BR> 4) Order of clearing. With the insanely fast respawn of roamers, you have to take care of them and then move on to a building to clear it. Which buildings must be cleared for a safer pull of the Maestro. <BR>  <BR> - From reading this board, it appears we do things differently on bb. This answers questions 4 thru 6:  Maestro is the last mob of the night. he is imo the hardest mob in hate, and one of the top 3 in the game. His big weakness is that he can be pulled solo like a gnoll pup anywhere we want him ) We clear the patrols, the close buildings, cleric house, then start clearing to Inno. When we get a window of opportunity, we all charge upstairs. (we dont make pets the whole night until we get upstairs btw). Inno is imo the easiest uber-mob in the game. He is quickly dispatched, then we move to back corner of his lair. At this point, details are sketchy. Our pull team (basically troppo a DE necro puller extrodinare) goes into the fully-spawned maestro room and pulls the maestro up to us solo. Everytime. *struggles to not gripe about the power of necros*  <BR>  <BR> 5) How do you actually pull the Maestro, do you have to clear out the main room first, or can you attempt to pull him using the standard monk chain pull technique?  <BR>  <BR> 6) Once Maestro is clear, how then do you proceed? Do you have to clear the zone before killing Innoruuk or can you just go straight on up there?  <BR>  <BR> 7) How do you go about pulling Innoruuk in the safest possible way?  <BR>  <BR> - Learned this the hard way. Just go upstairs. Hardest part of fighting Innoruuk is not falling off the ramp leading up to him.  <BR>  <BR> 8) Do you need a monk, or rather, what are teh minimum requirements for starting a Plane of Hate raid?  <BR>  <BR> Starting the PoH raid, this is how we do it: We meet at nek portal and bind there. We have twinks withstones on them camped there.  <BR>  <BR> First group to zone in is all non-KOS DE's and a druid to wolf them. When any group portals in, have everyone invised. The first group has the DE necros feign at archway, and outside.  <BR>  <BR> Groups then gate in (one at a time) when the people FD in hate tell them the patrols are out of the way. We gate in, run back 20 feet to corner (not against the wall, just near it), and we all /q to bb chat.  <BR>  <BR> This method usually gets at least 90% of the army in without a death. From there, see the answer to question one... have enchanters with you to mez and it is smooth sailing ;)  <BR>  <BR> Now someone point me to the &quot;how to avoid 8 hours of CR in fear&quot; discussion board please :)  <BR>  <BR> -- inigo  <BR> level 50 Chick Magnet, bristlebane  <BR>  <BR> If you read through all this, and are have experience in hate, I would like your thoughts on this: when the train comes, what is the order of Mobs you go for? we always kill clerics first, then spites, then whatever we feel like.  <BR>  <BR> Xand Delril <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/6/00 5:45:26 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> Good inigo <BR>  <BR> Your stratagy there is very efficient to answer some questions-  to efficiently kill Innoruuk, the best way of goin about it is to make sure everything else in the zone has been slain, then go for him, and since obviously stuff will be respawning, keep bout 2 groups back to catch any of them wanderin close (hopefully you will be able to pull him to a good spot were you wont have to worry bout much)  <BR>  <BR> A good number of people to have, i definitly agree with the first posting and what you said, 30+ people, one said bout 24, that will do if all are extremely coordinated(And maxed out lev 50's) but what will be necesary is 3-5 trolls, ogres, barbs, for tanks and good hitin,  3-5 bards, he couldnt be more right about how ecential the bards can be, there mana song and healing song can be life savers.  <BR> 2-3 monks, these are one of the hardest hittin classes, good to have 2 or 3 8+ nukers, wizards, druids, necros, mag's, these you will find will be inflicted a good portion of the damage  5+ clerics, for the buffs and HEALING these are really recomonded, and any other class you can find to help <BR>  <BR> Krelian <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/6/00 6:21:07 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> Train killing <BR>  <BR> Thanks Inigo and the others..  <BR>  <BR> As for Train killing order well I think that 2 approach can be taken.  <BR>  <BR> Basically this is the approach we have if the groups are tank heavy, kill the things that do the most dmg, and let the enchanters/shaman work on the others:  <BR>  <BR> Cleric (complete heal, /shout CLERIC!)  <BR> Ghast (Multiple Harm Touch)  <BR> Ashenbone Drakes (ouch)  <BR> Banshee (high resistance)  <BR> Kirakaiu (high resistance)  <BR> Revenant (Anoying AOE spells and good dmg dealing, need to cancel magic before hitting them, that`s why we keep them in the middle)  <BR> Abhorent (weak resists makes good pet or mez, worst case Torgor)  <BR> Loating Lich (very weak resists makes good pet or mez, worst case Torgor)  <BR> Revultant Rats (VERY weak resists makes good pet or mez, worst case Torgor)  <BR> Spite Golems (So long to kill them keep them last)  <BR>  <BR> Caster heavy groups put the pets on the high resistance mobs and blast the hell out of the weak resist ones, while you have the debuffers (tashan, Malosi) work on the high resist ones.  <BR>  <BR> I prefer the first approach myself, enchanter charming the prime targets while we destroy the hard resist in melee.  <BR>  <BR> We'll figure out how this zone work =)  <BR>  <BR> Krelian Lionheart - 50 Shaman on E'ci  <BR> Survivor of a 7 mobs train in Hate  <BR> Victim of a 16 mob train in Hate  <BR>  <BR>                      . <BR> seaen <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/8/00 4:06:11 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> whats up with rangers? <BR>  <BR> well after doing Hate last night, i reaized hate is not al that worth it for us. 1st we only have 2 items in hate, one being the reve whip< its a ok weapon some like it better then the ykehsa, we have been doing hate every day for a week straid only one whip so far, second item is a sword droped by inn well its a kick ass sword but he only drops one, and hes like a 10 day spawn, so hope you win the roll.  Rangers are just good dmg, my group(ranger(me)druid, enchanter, bard, cleric, and rogue took like 90% of the kills, i walked out of hate with no gain at all, you are gona die it happens Hate is a bugged zone. Meastro attacked me first when we pulled him, he hit me for solit 200's till i was dead, cleric couldnt heal fast enough after that he was jumping all over killing casters... not a good thing had to CR. we will try again to night hopefully with more sucess.  <BR>  <BR> Seaen  <BR> 47 ranger of Tunare <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Bean <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/9/00 8:11:36 am) <BR> Reply <BR> Re: whats up with rangers? <BR>  <BR> What a crazy mixed up bunch you are.  <BR>  <BR> Dracholiche  <BR> Maestro  <BR> Lord Nagafen  <BR> Lady Vox  <BR> Cazic Thule  <BR> Innoruuk  <BR>  <BR> That is without a doubt the silliest list of hardest to easiest I have ever seen. There are NO opinions on this matter, the list is:  <BR>  <BR> Lord Nagafen  <BR> Lady Vox  <BR> Dracoliche  <BR> Innoruuk  <BR> Maestro  <BR> Cazic Thule  <BR>  <BR> I don't see how you can not see that...but then again I'm reading a thread with waving tactics written all over it. People, you can do Vox with 18 people and suffer minimal casualties. You can fight Cazic with 12 and win. No waving is necessary on anything! Yes thats right, WAVING IS A WASTE OF TIME! But I dunno, if waving is how you get something to die, then god damnit you go wave that thing to death. More Power to you.  <BR>  <BR> Noruas <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/10/00 10:31:49 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> uhhhh.... <BR>  <BR> meastro is by far the hardest solo mob in the game. him, and maybe dracolitch.  <BR>  <BR> where draco has AE fear, meastro has AE lifedrain. which gives him a LOT more hp.  <BR>  <BR> vox and nag are simple, 10 people have done them both in 1 night on our server.  <BR> 2-3 groups is plenty. <BR>  <BR> meastro alone killed 45 people the othernight.  <BR>  <BR> it was suggusted that we not summon pets, becuase of casters going LD and the pets turning, but in the end it killed us all pets are a lot of damage, and can take abuse.  <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Gholam Stickyfingers <BR> Global user <BR> (1/11/00 4:15:56 am) <BR> Reply <BR> Re: efficient stratagy <BR>  <BR> Dracolich is actually not all that hard alone... dragon fear is nothing (buff resist to 65 or so with items, <BR> then resist magic to 100+, never get feared again), and his AE DOT is easily dealt with by having 15 <BR> buffs on you (any buffs except illusions - those get cancelled by fear). When you have 15 buffs, nothing else sticks on you - and as straight melee, any mob is a joke against a large group. <BR>  <BR> Gholam Stickyfingers  <BR> 50 Rogue, E'ci <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Oaklandbash <BR> Unregistered User <BR> (1/15/00 12:00:07 pm) <BR> Reply <BR>  <BR> On Cazic we kill Maestro with 20 to 24 and the only person that dies from time to time is the monk if he does not get a sucessful feign. We have the monk pull him to in front of the big house, then have a non agro shaman in wolf/skellie form (from amulet of necropotence) pull Maestro single from pull point and we mow through him. Granted, he has a TON of HP, but 4 groups can do him with EASE if you have your tanks with good weapons. The trick to Maestro is too remember, he HATES fire, conflag and druid fire spell hit for full. <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Smegal <BR> Global user <BR> (1/18/00 8:16:27 pm) <BR> Reply <BR> Re: Are you insane?? <BR>  <BR> Lol. I'd say its this way. Innoruuk has some mean tricks up his sleave and plenty of DTs.  <BR>  <BR> Innoruuk  <BR> Lord Nagafen  <BR> Dracoliche  <BR> Lady Vox  <BR> Maestro  <BR> Cazic Thule  <BR>  <BR> But in the end 24 properly perpared, buffed, and equiped people can easily own all of the above. We usually lose only 1-5 people against them, most from Death Touchs. Vox is a total push over, with a couple of pallies bashing, and 5 fatties slamming its a push over. Had 0 deaths on both are last Nagafen and Vox raids.  <BR>  <BR> Smegal BoneMender - Afterlife guild, Mithaniel Marr server <BR> ************************************************************** <BR> Once again, comments are gladly appreciated!  </font><P><font color="#FF0000">.....~Oriz Stormweaver~.....</font><br>
