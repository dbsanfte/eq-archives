I listened and watched for a while, and was actually a bit sad to see that his being booted from his *Second* guild didn't help swing him around to trying to be a more positive player. All of the same characteristics were there....KSing, and when called on it, rude and vulgar language - littered with haughty things like &quot;I am so much better than all of you combined&quot; in public, nasty and vile innuendo and commentary in /tell, bad attitude and any lack of civilized behavior at all.<br><br>This incident in oasis that I observed was not the first such occurance, and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if others out there had similar bad experiences with the pally named Fahn, so after observing what I had last night, ultimately decided I'd post a warning to folks (and quite possibly his new guild). You've got a bad seed on your hands if you invite Fahn into a group or situation, so be forewarned, that if things don't go the way Fahn dictates, or Fahn expects, or people don't bow down to this child's need to be the most superior in his immediate circle, he quickly turns immature, rude, verbally abusive, and quite simply....throws temper tantrums you'd expect from a 5 year old.<br><br>Watch for him. Like his prior two guilds, I imagine he's still out there burning bridges....as last night attested to quite well. His temper tantrums usually result in deaths, trains, or endless /tells of a truly disgusting variety, as he attempts to make himself feel superior and above it all. He apparently feels he needs no friends, and as much as he alienates everyone I've ever seen him interact with, he's well on his way to having just that.<br><br>Some people never learn, it would appear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwicc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wicc</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/wicccelestae/theonion.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/14/00 10:25:10 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/wicccelestae/redhat01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fahn</span><hr size=1> OMG this is the same guy that was KSing my enchanter twink.<br>this was like 1-2 weeks ago in oasis.  <br><br>Dunno why Im sure my caimens were green to him, but whatever floats your boat =p <p><TABLE><TR BGCOLOR="BLACK"><FONT COLOR="Purple" SIZE="6" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Bold"><B><I>                 WICC</B></I></FONT></TR><TR BGCOLOR="BLACK"><FONT COLOR=PURPLE><B>                               Retired member of</CENTER></TR><TR><IMG SRC="http://sa.digitallucidity.net/pix/logo.jpg"></TR></TABLE></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwicc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wicc</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/wicccelestae/theonion.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 11/14/00 10:27:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujekakiril.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeka Kiril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/15/00 4:34:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fahn</span><hr size=1> Is he a dorf pally?

He comes running up swearing at us, that the caimen was his. We told him he was nowhere near it and we hit it initially anywho. He then says &quot;Let me put it this way! FUCK YOU!&quot;, and after that, he shouts to the entire zone...&quot;Watch out for Jeka! He's a KSER!&quot; &quot;damn newbie bitches&quot;...he also said he'd kick my ass in a duel, but I couldn't find him after he told me he was waiting at docks, then he called me a &quot;fucking twink&quot;, and I reported him.

Although I'm loving your attempt to justify it away and couldn't resist the digs above. It was your verbally abusive behavior when you aren't getting your way, both outloud in /say, and the vile things you say in /tell. There are *children* that play this game. I can't even imagine what they would take away from an encounter with you.

But I'll leave with one thing. Fahn? Regardless of what you think of me, or my motivations for putting you here....will you do me one favor? Remember that not just adults or teenagers are playing this game. That you have no real way of knowing who's under that model that you've just let loose on. Imagine that it's your 8 year old sister, and think twice before you start unleashing, ok?

You take this game like it really is real life.  I saw your picture and I guess you deserve to look as ugly as you do in real life.  If you notice I don't play this game at all and when I did I did for only about 1 day a week.  You can talk about me all you want and lie about me in game.  I could care less because I know that you don't have people skills because if you did you would be out going to parties, having fun, going to movies with friends but you don't.  Normal people don't like you.  In real life people think I am attractive and I am nice to most people to go with it.  I tried being nice to you guys but you losers like to be mean to people who are better off socially than you.<br><br>Well get this.  People that have alot of friends in high school or college and don't spend there whole times playing video games and end up getting professional jobs.  People like you end up working at Burger King, pumping gas,working at laundromats and or other such places.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhsianlichen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hsian Li Chen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/21/00 10:41:31 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hsian-li.tripod.com/webme.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rugen</span><hr size=1> i've said it before and i'll say it again, nothing quite as satisfying as someone justifying their own shitlist post ;D<br><br>xianmonkie<br><br>o o<br>\_/<br> <p><table width="550" border="0" align="center">  <tr>     <td width="550">       <div align="center">         <p><img src="http://hsian-li.tripod.com/xiananimesig.jpg"><br>          "Yes, I solo a lot.
