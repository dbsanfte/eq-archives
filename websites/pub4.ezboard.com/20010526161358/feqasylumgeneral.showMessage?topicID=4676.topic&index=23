<br>
Yes, we were on our way to TD to kill Faydedar for the druid epic. We were not in a huge hurry because we did not know we were going to have to race for something when our two enchanters had already been there for the entire raid and were still in Fear. <br>
<br>
Lumey, don't flatter yourself. People petitioned because someone trained, noone ever said it was you. How the hell does a mage effectively train anyway? All you would do is die. <br>
<br>
As far as screenshots, they don't mean shit. The GM's were called in and they watched the events unfold. No 7D members were given a warning because we were not responsible for the train that was pulled along with the Shissar. <br>
<br>
The sad thing is I actually used to get along with Mizy. Times change. So do people. <br>

People and times do change.  Something happens when people get passed level 50 in this game.  Before then, friendships and people tend to matter more than loot.  After then, well, SOMEtimes friendship counts for something.<br>
<br>
Look at this example.  Six months ago, who wanted FFA on mobs?  Now, who wants it on most of them?  /shrug.  Interesting set of lists huh?  Have you noticed how many have changed thier beliefs?  People forget what it was like when they get to the level of raid experience or numbers when they don't need as long to plan things.  &quot;The other person&quot; begins to count less and less.  <br>
<br>
Here, two strong groups want the same mob and are basically after it at the same time.  Who has &quot;the right&quot; to be there?  Well, by Verant's rules, both groups.  By the calendar rules, frankly both groups as no sceduled raid is going on and two people in the zone waiting around don't make a raid.  How many times has someone lost a camp in Seb because your group members are a little slow to assemble?  It's not really different in this instance.  Each side will believe they were &quot;in the right.&quot;  There you have a prime example of how FFA on mobs can work (and probably will more and more Sigh).  Oh joy.  Now think about the fact that there were only 2 groups contesting the mob at this time.  Imagine if more were in the mix.  Welcome to Chaos!  <br>
<br>
Thank you Verant for providing the vehicle for the worst aspects of human nature to hold sway.  Since both groups beleived they were &quot;in the right&quot; there they weren't interested in compromise.  There was no way that they were going to work together for one of the enchanters or for the chance of a roll for both enchanters.  It's so sad because both enchanters have probably worked very hard on thier epics and BOTH were deserving of that piece.  I have no idea of what spawns the Shissar or what his spawn cycle is, but he doesn't seem to be around a lot.<br>
<br>
Disappointments like this can be hard to get passed.  Yes, EQ is a game.  But, when your emotions get involved to the extent they likely did here, it's not really just a game anymore is it?  I wish people would always remember that the avatars they deal with represent people and try to see both sides in a dispute like this.  Unfortnately, that doesn't happen in real life and it won't happen often in EQ.<br>
<br>
What, exactly, went wrong here?  Hard to say.  First, misinformation if it was believed that Fear was empty.  Two people do not constitute a raid, but they don't make the plane empty and completely available.  When Mizy and Co entered the zone, how were things handled?  Was there a reasonable dialog or was there a confrontational manner used?  I know that I, personally, will not give ground if confronted as readily as I will when reasoned with or asked for something.  /shrug.  Maybe that's just me?  Would it have mattered anyway?  I dunno the answers to these questions, but they are something to think about.<br>
<br>
One comment though . . . the few times I've been in Fear since the upgrade, the mobs sure seemed to roam a whole lot more and are often where they really shouldn't have been.  Were there really trains or is that just the way the upgraded Fear works now?  I've not been in Fear enough to really venture an opinion here.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#D5D4D5><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usarissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarissa</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>4/26/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>11:54:10 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re:</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Fear does work that way sometimes, and there are still bugs with mob aggro/pathing/clipping.

<br>
&quot;Roamers&quot; are also random on a list (thought bleeders being on that list to give you an idea of how rare some occur). I cannot say whether one trained the other or whatever because I wasn't there. I can say that in Fear you can get some pretty weird aggros. Lots of mobs criss-crossing and sometimes they line up in a bad way and can bring stuff from pretty far away 'cuz of the way yell works.<br>

Tri Airs is composed of mostly Asian players who play, for the most part, late at night (for those of us in the US).
