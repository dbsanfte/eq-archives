Sorry.<br>
<br>
First of all: I live in New York, I have seen the billowing smoke, the countless sheets of plain paper, posted at bus stops with happy photos and tragic phone numbers... "Missing Person." I was in the crowds evacuated, and seen the skies, devoid of those artificial stars... the F-16s and Blackhawks flying overhead ever since, and the camcorder footage from every imaginable angle. I have just lived the worst week of my life, known some who have lost friends or relations and I have been affected no less than anyone else in this tragedy. Perhaps more.<br>
<br>
Now... I have a request to make. I seem to remember a little saying some of us sometimes say: "innocent until proven guilty." That's right. I am devastated by what has recently happened, but my morals and values remain intact. We have very little evidence pointing towards the perpetrators (their superiors, rather) of this heinous crime. The car... the hotel room... the Florida flight school... lots of other dead ends. We don't know who is behind this yet. Please stop speculating and accusing the various ethnic groups, countries or individuals that are becoming all too prominent targets for a lot of us.<br>
<br>
Innocent until proven guilty... please remember these four words next time you express your anger against someone else. Though this phrase is used in a different context under normal circumstances, the underlying reason for it is universal. It is not used to protect the guilty, it is used to protect the innocent from being unjustly persecuted. Whether regarding a court room dispute or a national emergency, if we are to have everyone believe that we live under and support the constitution and all that it stands for, we need to show it. I'm not one to oppose retaliation however. When we find out who is responsible, we must respond accordingly. But until then, sit tight and don't childishly point fingers along with some the media, filling its airtime with speculation and guesses for lack of better news :o<br>
<br>
That is all. thx~ u all!!!11!11!!!@!! ^_^;;<br>

I presume you are talking about Osama Bin Laden, specifically.<br>
<br>
He is not "innocent" by any stretch of the imagination.<br>
<br>
He has admitted to other terrorist acts committed against the US.<br>
<br>
Whether he committed this particular act is largely irrelevent.  He and his kind are what we are at war with.<br>
<br>
You live in a haze of the old world, where enemies had borders and could be identified easily.  The world has changed, largely as we went about our merry lives.  Terrorism and terrorists are what we are at war with now.  Honestly, we've been at war with them for awhile, we've just ignored our side of the conflict as they've shot insults, bullets, and bombs in our direction.<br>
<br>
In a case like this you can never have 100% certainty, it doesn't exist.  To ask it is arrogant and misguided.  We must go on our best judgement using the evidence we have.<br>
<br>
It's a broad stroke, but unfortunately it is the only thing we have.<br>
<br>
No (sane) person wants genocide, racial profiling, or demonization of ethic/religious group, but what we must come to terms with is that a section of the world has a long and illustrious history of harboring terrorism and it's perpetrators, it is long past time to make those countries, organizations, sects and communities realize what they harbor is not in our best interest - or theirs.<br>

The President has stated; &quot;We will not take action until we prove who is behind this&quot; or something like that.  It does not sound like Bush is going to act on &quot;broad strokes&quot; as you state.  Let the President do his job as he sees fit.  If he changes his mind later, that is his choice.  He has a pime suspect, but as he has stated he will not take action based on suspicion alone.<br>
<br>
If the President said we have a prime suspect and we will now go after him, then fine, but that is NOT what the President says at the moment.<br>
<br>
Also, even if the prime suspect turns out to be PROVEN to be behind this, I think more importantly he was saying not to judge a nation or an ethnic group based on that.  The President will decide who should be punished, lets let him decide instead of pointing fingers.  If you want to say anyone who contributed to this is guilty, we can probably find a way to prove most people in this country were a contributing part of it just for paying their taxes.  I do not wish to get into that, just realize that many things we do affect the world.  Let the President decide who should be punished for this.  <br>
The same way you allow the judicial system to decide who should be punished.  Remember sometimes it can help an investigation to provide immunity to someone who has key information for a more important guilty party.  Not to say this will happen, but it might.<br>
<br>
I may not agree with everything Bush says or does, but I have put my trust in him to handle this appropriately.  If he does not, I have my vote next Election Day.<br>
<br>
God Bless America.  God Bless GWB.  God Bless this planet.<br>

I find it tragic and ironic that after all the resources the US has put into building up and sustaining a large offensive military force, they are faced with a different threat. Our available weapons, and to some extent our outlook is still based on having a known enemy state with concrete borders, against which war can be declared. This is partly what I have been talking about... people look at what has transpired Tuesday, and they see it as though we can isolate a single country as our enemy. We even call it an "act of war" instead of terrorism.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the world has changed. The Cold War is over, and so has the method by which war is waged. We cannot probe the radar network of a faceless enemy with no official connections to any nation before sending in F-117s as we did during Desert Storm. We need a different type of knife to slice this bread. However, some people don't seem to understand that, madly screaming for retaliation and bombing... watcha gonna bomb, hotshot? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utriff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Triff</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triffdot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 9:36:24 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/trifflogo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Little Request...</span><hr size=1> Well, Agalkin, you see shit like that far too often when you have a large group of angry people.

I will fully support Bush, in whatever decision he makes.  Up until 9/11 I didn't care for Bush one iota.  But, now I must admit he's just about the most fitting person for this situation.<br>
<br>
The charge that our military is ill-fitted to handle this is an exaggeration.<br>
<br>
If we do it right our military will be fine, coupled with a good campaign of economic propaganda.  Propaganda is an overly dramatic word, but that's basically what it will take.<br>
<br>
What won't work:<br>
Guerrilla tactics<br>
Diplomacy<br>
Sanctions<br>
Bombing from afar<br>
Surgical strikes<br>
<br>
We may use a variety of these to soften them up, but to break the back of a well funded organization you have to hit it at it's root... money.  That will take an invasion.  Bin Laden (if he's the target) is worth 200 million dollars - that's the prime reason he is such a threat, take away the money and he becomes a fanatic that can't cross the Atlantic.<br>
<br>
After we do this, we'll likely use our economic prowess to woo the populace.<br>
<br>
Listen to Colin Powell, Hugh Shelton, Bush, and Rumsfeld.. the hints are there.  They're planning something fairly massive.  "1 million reservists alerted" "40 billion dollars" "long term campaign" "Nato enacts article 5"<br>
<br>
Granted this goes presumes a lot.  I look forward to seeing what they've actually planned, I have no doubt it'll be comprehensive.<br>

<br>
I hope what you suggest is part of the plan, those ideas do sound a lot less violent than the &quot;Nuke em all&quot; that I see so often.  I realize that violence will undoubtedly occur and that bombing will most likely occur.  But I would rather see Bush use his brains more than our brawns.  We are a powerful nation, we can do this without becoming just as barbaric as the terrorists were.  And the main reason I feel Bush will do the right thing is because I have interpreted his speeches to mean that we will handle this with intelligence and as little violence as possible.  For now, that is all I ask for.<br>

The US will spend WAY more than that each day if we go to war.<br>
<br>
He may be worth 200 million, but he will either be funded by outsiders or he will run out of cash real fast.  Either way it doesn't matter because it is obvious he has lots of people that are willing to die for free.<br>
<br>
Vietnam is a prime example (don't get into whether or not we should have been there, or whether or not we commited enough effort)... enemies knew the land, they dug tunnels and hid.  We need to dump in the "gas," light it and smoke them out is all (yes, I know, over simplification more analogy than realism).<br>
<br>
Either way.. if you talk about the rights of innocent Americans and you support in ANY way the persecution, verbal or otherwise, of american citizens of arab origin (sorry if this is not pc term) then you are a HYPOCRITE and need to be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  You are NOT a patriot, and I venture to say that the dead in NY and DC would be ASHAMED of you.  <br>
<br>
Not only are you not helping, but you are as bad as the terrorists.  You are trying to make a point by hurting innocents.  You claim to be protecting Americans, or the American ideal and yet you forget one of our major protections... and you declare guilt before guilt is proven.  In America, it doesn't matter if you laugh over the dead, if you spit on the flag, you are scum - worthless flesh - but you are still innocent of a crime until the court declares you guilty, and the COURT will decide your sentence.  If you dole out your own version of your own justice you are nothing but a rogue, something about as unamerican as you can get.<br>
<br>
Even IF the FBI came out and said that they knew for FACT that there were 200 terrorists hiding in the US waiting to strike.  EVERY single person deserves the benefit of the doubt.  If you think someone is involved, call the police or FBI, now more than ever they will take you 100% serious.  If they don't then call your local news station.  If you see someone persecute someone for their heritage and don't do anything to help then you are not only guilty of the same, but you are also a coward. <p>Cendan Tankenpriest<br>
