Ok, the groceries are unpacked, give standard reply when not sure who someone is, but think I might know them.<br>

[Fri Dec 14 16:13:25 2001] ---------------------------<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:13:25 2001] [23 Cleric] Saleem (Dwarf) &lt;Guild Tag removed, he’s already been deguilded following conversation with guild officer&gt;<br>
<br>
Nope, don’t think I know him, but the name sounds like the Alt of a good friend of mine I have not seen in a while, Saom, the wizard.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:13:25 2001] There is 1 player in East Commonlands.<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:13:38 2001] You told Saleem, 'not as saleem the cleric, were you a wizzie?'<br>
 [Fri Dec 14 16:14:03 2001] Saleem tells you, 'yes remember his name?'<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:14:27 2001] You told Saleem, 'I think so. Saom?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:14:40 2001] Saleem tells you, 'yes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
 [Fri Dec 14 16:14:51 2001] Saleem tells you, ''<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:14:57 2001] You told Saleem, 'my memory for names for once did not let me down'<br>
 [Fri Dec 14 16:15:03 2001] Saleem tells you, 'I see you have been selling that ring for ages npw'<br>
 [Fri Dec 14 16:15:09 2001] Saleem tells you, '<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:15:11 2001] You told Saleem, 'which ring?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:15:14 2001] Saleem tells you, '+wiz'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:15:26 2001] You told Saleem, 'ah, have sold it a hundred times lol'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:15:39 2001] Saleem tells you, 'can ya let me borrow it pweasee till ya sell it and ill get a port to WC steaight away?'<br>
<br>
OK, already this doesn’t sound like Saom.  Saom was always extremely polite, and came across as an older man, with the politeness and manners age brings.  This sounds like a kid already.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:15:57 2001] You told Saleem, 'which ring again? the 7wis?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:15:57 2001] Saleem tells you, 'I am an honest guy you know I wont steal'<br>
<br>
This definitely isn’t Saom<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:03 2001] Saleem tells you, 'Yes plz'<br>
<br>
OK, now I know it isn’t Saom, he would never, ever, ever, ever use the word PLZ.  Nor would he ever beg or borrow stuff, he was a man of great pride, who would never let me give him anything he had not earnt himself.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:07 2001] Saleem tells you, 'if its no bother'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:22 2001] You told Saleem, 'I don’t make the rings till I have a sale, so the ring odes not exist'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:24 2001] Saleem tells you, 'I need more +wiz for this low lvl raid at luclin'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:40 2001] Saleem tells you, 'you are selling +7 wiz ring right?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:54 2001] Saleem tells you, 'and I was wondering if I could borrow plz?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:54 2001] You told Saleem, 'I am, but I sell all jewellery, but I don’t make it till I have an order'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:16:58 2001] Saleem tells you, 'till ya sell it?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:17:02 2001] You told Saleem, 'yes'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:17:07 2001] Saleem tells you, 'plz'<br>
<br>
OK, way too many PLZ’s here, time to prove its not him.  The Saom I know once had a friend of mine, Sejal, make him an imbued platinum fire opal ring.  It took him ages to save up for it.  However, once it was made, he and Sejal were never on at the same time, and each were forever asking if I had seen the other, so they could arrange the handover.  It became a running joke with Saom and me.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:17:20 2001] You told Saleem, 'Saom, Sejal made you a ring, what was it'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:17:22 2001] Saleem tells you, 'when ya want it send a tell to me store me on friend list ill do you too?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:17:36 2001] Saleem tells you, 'I didn't get one made '<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:00 2001] Saleem tells you, 'my friends char was a wiz calleds that that I made at his house across road from me in RL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
<br>
Erm, excuse me, didn’t you tell me you were Saom a few minutes ago?<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:18 2001] Saleem tells you, 'he sold ring and deleted char <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
<br>
He doesn’t know what he is talking about here, and is floundering…<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:24 2001] You told Saleem, 'you are not Saom, or you would know the answer to that question,  Nor do you act as Saom, I do not wish to speak to you again'<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:25 2001] Saleem tells you, 'I made it before I got EQ'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:40 2001] Saleem tells you, 'Huh I am not Saom'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:45 2001] Saleem tells you, 'my friend was'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:47 2001] Saleem tells you, 'in RL'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:18:51 2001] Saleem tells you, 'it was his account'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:19:06 2001] You told Saleem, 'u pretended to be Saom, you are not him,  I am not impressed'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:19:11 2001] Saleem tells you, 'ok if you don’t believe me and wish not to speak I am sorry madam ill be going'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:19:26 2001] Saleem tells you, 'my friend made a char wiz called that in RL'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:19:33 2001] Saleem tells you, 'and he got the ring'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:19:40 2001] Saleem tells you, 'ok nm byeeeee'<br>
<br>
Saom was an older man (if not, his manner and vocabulary indicated he was.  No way was he a friend of this punk kid.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:24:06 2001] Dews tells you, 'morning ysall how are you today ?'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:24:31 2001] You told Dews, 'hi dear, someone just tried to scam me, so need to write down log, can you give me a few'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:24:42 2001] Dews tells you, 'sure, who was it so I can watch out'<br>
[Fri Dec 14 16:47:45 2001] You petition, 'Scammer named Saleem pretended to be an alt of wizzie called Saom, and tried to get me to loan him a 7wis ring, it did not sound like him, and when I tested him, he made up story bout being friend of Saom.  He lied when I checked story'<br>
<br>
The above is from my log, but it has been amended to remove the spam, and I ran it through a spell checker to correct the more unreadable misspellings, apart from that, its totally as recorded at the time.<br>
<br>
OK, so there you have it.  I spoke to his guild leader, and they confronted him immediately.  He did not deny anything, and they deguilded him within 5 minutes of me talking to them.  I haven’t named the guild, although perhaps I should, as they have behaved in exemplary and prompt fashion.<br>
<br>
As for Saleem?  I think we have in fact met before, I think I sold you some jewlery.  What on earth possessed your to try this.  Jeez, all this for a lousy 450pp ring, was it worth it?<br>
<br>
On a more general note, the ‘Do you know me trick is a common one’.  You give a name who you think it is, and they play along, so you think you are dealing with someone you can trust.  Don’t fall for it<br>

I have not yet once seen him steal anything, As for the impersonation that i cant comment on as it is not clear. For one thing he is DEFINATLY Not a scammer as he is only 13 years old i doubt he knows what that word means so putting him up on this board is a bit harsh. Yet, as you see him as a threat i am aware that you are concerned for others and yourself. I am at the minute speaking with the guild leader and things are being dealt with. Any questions dont place them here, /tell me in game and ill answer.<br>

[Fri Dec 14 16:18:51 2001] Saleem tells you, 'it was his account' (refering to my account which my brother also uses)<br>
<br>
Here he refers to MY BROTHER who DID make a wizard not called saom but a name VERY VERY similar within the last few weeks, I made him delete it because i wanted the space for a beastlord, Not to fall out with eadonman but saleem is his main character, He has one other character a warrior and the other char on his account is his dads. I am not naming his dads character. And fisarik not all 13 year olds are clever you know, I didnt know what scam meant until not so long ago and im 15, Sorry if we arent all wizz kids, u may be and good for you, but not everyone are. I think this 'scam' has been blown out of proportion and is a lot of pressure on VoE who are trying there hardest to get the full story and as im the only person that has his side of the story im doing more harm than good to myself. Which i didnt want to do. All i wanted to show was that it was a mistake. I will be having serious words with him and ill tell him not to ask anyone if he can even see their sales, I feel sorry for him, It took him 4 months to get to lvl 23 which is a long time but to him its an achievment in his eyes, now he's been ripped to pieces by being named as a scammer, Like being named a murderer. Just hope you can forgive him in his mistakes.<br>

<br>
If it was an honest mistake, which I tend to doubt given that he was trying to borrow an expensive item based on Saom's friendship with Ysall then the 13 yr old involved should at least apologize to Ysall. <br>

Either way if his father is an EQ player perhaps he needs to supervise his son a bit more closely and give him some guidance as to what is and isn't acceptable conduct. Because believe it or not the behavior of your children is a a reflection on you as a parent. <p><img src = http://dotsplace.50megs.com/images/leld2l.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udunwutspeeritnite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunwut Speeritnite</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.holystorm.org/boardstemp/stormshield.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/15/01 1:15:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Saleem 27 Cleric - Impersonator and Scammer</span><hr size=1> [Fri Dec 14 16:13:38 2001] You told Saleem, 'not as saleem the cleric, were you a wizzie?'<br>

Right here he tries to pass off himself as Saom. He may have tried to come clear later but he shouldn't have lied in the first place.<br>

Do your friend a favor Kermus. Even if he isn't a scammer, beggars are the second most despised player in the game. Tell him to leave off the begging and he won't find himself in this kind of situation.<br>

I agree with you here, He has made a mistake which has gone totally out of control, I juts hope he isn't seen as a scammer as most others who actually do intend to scam are. Im aware he is begging which we tell him off for, and his father cant keep an eye on him as he is at work A LOT especially during the day/evening. Well i hope it is settled now. Cya'll around<br>

<br>
I just see a lot of people who like to beg, and all they care about is getting the &quot;Phat lewts&quot;.  You all know them, and see them when you run through GFay.  The random &quot;Hey man u got anyhting 4 a newbie ranger&quot; tells... The ones that start off innocently enough (&quot;A_Person_I've_never_heard_of tell's me &quot;Hey male whats up!&quot;)... the people who spend HOURS just /shouting &quot;newbie looking 4 good dr00d gear! send tells!&quot; instead of hunting, or meeting people, or making friends.<br>
<br>
Bleh, anyways.  My take on most of these people is that they are mostly (god I hope mostly) younger players, in the 12-14 range, who see that awesome twink run by in full Ry'Gorr at level 5 and want a piece of that, right-now-by-god!.  I kinda lump all those folks together, and I'll always offer buffs and advice, but I've been burned too many times helping some apparent newbie out to give out gear to people lightly, even old/vendor trash gear.<br>

Don't try defending this, fairly convincing, eh?<br>
<br>
Icetooth has begged from me before. . .<br>
<br>
More on the lines of:<br>
Him:"Hey, you know Kermus?"<br>
Me: "Yes, he was in the old guild I lead"<br>
Him: "Oh! I know him in RL!"<br>
Me: "Oh. . ."<br>
Him: "Got any extra warrior gear?"<br>
<br>
Why would he ask me for free stuff? I mean, friends ask me to let them borrow something or help them out, but I just meet this guy because he knows someone that was in the same guild as me. This is begging!<br>
<br>
I'm not really pointing anything out. . . just adding to the fire.<br>

Scam or not the things he did were wrong.   On the other hand, I think Kermus is just tryin to help someone that he knows and shouldn't be hammered for it.  Loyalty to a friend is an admirable quality even if at the moment the friend has done something wrong and shown, at best, poor judgement.  <br>
<br>
As for the rest of it, hell I have been scammed before and I know it sucks.  Ysall prob has too and that is the reason for the caution that was shown.  It is over, Saleem is up here for it now.  If he gets higher level and changes his behavior no one will remember this post and he will have cleared himself. If he doesn't then, it will be well deserved.  I believe that Ysall handled it correctly.  I thank Ysall for bringing it to our guilds attention.  <br>

Having talked to him, I am inclined to beleive their was a degree of confusion on his part about the name Saom, and that this was not a deliberate act of impersonation.<br>
<br>
As for Kermus, ill advised or otherwise, he has stuck by his friend and defended him through thick and thin, and sometimes the value of a true friendship is not just in backing up your friends when they are right, but in doing so when they are wrong.  I would therefore wish no damage to Kermus for doing the best he could to stand by a RL friend.<br>
<br>
Saleem is mighty young to be playing this game, and, as with many young players, he has a begging problem.  Kermus, I hope, will give him the same message we hould give to all players who beg, kill stuff, level, earn your own gear, and you will find the game experience far more rewarding.<br>
<br>
From my perpective, this matter is now closed, and I am content to give Saleem another chance.  I ask that the Emarr community do the same.<br>

However, i realize this is easier said then done but obviuosly a beggar's list will identify those who beg.  I think if someone you don't know asks you for something, it won't be that hard to identify that he or she is a beggar.<br>
