<br>
The days and hours before you scrounge up every scrap of resist gear possible, knowing 1 point could mean the difference between life and icecube.  Ya then start the trek to Permafrost, giving you time to think - I am going to die, I wont get any loot..why am I going?  The you get together with all the other raiders, ask last minute advice, discuss tactics with other people of your class etc.  People fool around, make jokes - prolly to release tension.<br>
<br>
The raid leader comes along (Kerna), and forms the groups, its all a bit chaotic, then the order to enter the zone comes.  Ya wander in, all groups enter, then we all follow the golden blue Dorf to the King room.  People mill around, casters beg for crack, buffs fly left right and centre.  Noone really knows where to sit, what to do, then the puller calls out Inc Frost Giants. <br>
<br>
This is when everything comes together, everyone knows how to kill stuff and funtion in a team, spells fly, tanks attack, chanters call whats mezzed, the puller calls to reassist, and then the big blue smurfs all die.  I can say that it was a pleasure to be on a raid with 33 very cool, calm, and professional players, the depth of raiding experience blew me away (Orinworf, Crombattleaxe, Siilverain come to mind)<br>
<br>
We all get to the buff hall, and as far as I know it all went smoothly, I dont know why Levitate wasnt part of it, considering all the pit traps and the Lady's dragonfear.  I expect it stems from A Necro trying to be useful!<br>
<br>
We logged and Kerna told us our tactics, mine were easy, send in my, pet, wait until 50, then run up and Nuke.<br>
We ran in, I used my hot keys to pump mana in Hinmera and Shimi (Clerics both), then when the command came I charged.<br>
<br>
I don't know how many times I resisted fear, and it seemed every step I took I lost a bubble of life.  Also the lag made the short run seem to last for minutes rather than a few seconds.  When I saw my health dropping so quickly it was hard to resist 49 levels of trained running instinct and to keep going forward!<br>
<br>
I got to Vox, I think I managed to cast 2 life taps, her health bar hadn't caught up, according to what I saw she was still at 90% life.  I thought something had gone wrong, and we had to go and die to save the tanks.<br>
<br>
Then she dropped! I remebered to take screen shots, people got ressed and healed, the loot devided.  Without any disrespect intended to Kerna, no one really know the after fight procedure.  People bailed very quickly, unfortunaltely the clerics were among them.  In hindsigt I also shoulve bought some coffins with me to recover those that had fallen down the pits.  Luckily my fellow Necro Sakkath ported to OT and came back with one from his bank.<br>
<br>
Once I got a port out (thanks Jex) it was an odd feeling hanging around in WC.  I kindof expected people to know that we had all just killed a Dragon! but it was the same old /ooc and /auction stuff.  The mobs in WC seemed tiny, the'd be specks on Giants and Vox's feet.  Then the adrenaline and the rush wore off, and life returned to normal.<br>
<br>
See you all next time! and a huge thankyou to each and every one of you who made that raid my most enjoyable and memorable EQ moment to date.  (Even Crom who called me a bearded Gnome)<br>

You were indeed in excellent company for your slaying!  Kerna, Orinwarf, Crombattleaxe, and Siilverain are some of the greatest folks out there, and it is small wonder that it went well!<br>
<br>
Your story, and your lovely attitude through it exemplify for me the best in dragon battles.  However small they may seem to those who have long left them behind, yours is the story of wonder and exultation at battle well waged and well won.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your story,<br>

Everyone left because of the loot. 2 bard scales, a bard horn, and Ice Comet (wiz spell) is way from normal vox loot. You always get everyone rezzed before you give out loot and we had a corpse in the pits. Still don't know why the cleric's left us when we had 3 corpses, 2 of which were Jex's. You can bet I'll find out.<br>

Felt really useless on that raid, contributed nothing. So I ooc'd for a res(more than once).....never got one. Paid the nec in my group 1/2 the price of a coffin to get my corpse out of pits, then had my corpse dragged to zone. seems all the clerics when seeing no corpses around Vox all left..Sorry to rant here its, not my intention. I just think that the clerics leaving without finishing their job was bull...I felt let down by them. Clerics are supposed to be trusted,trusted to keep you alive in battle and trusted to bring you back after death....this didn't happen on this raid..I thank those that helped me get my corpse to the zone. As for the clerics....what comes around goes around.....have fun and be safe....<br>

Kerna is for me a great leader and, as it is said up, it was an easy fight.<br>
<br>
As a bard, I was surprised how I could so easily charm Ice Giants, with rare resists.<br>
<br>
I was very lucky Vox dropped most for bards. I am sorry for the others who didn't get anything.<br>
<br>
I was disapointed to see how many players leaved very early after Vox was dead and looted.<br>

I'd like to make more dragon raids with Kerna.

It was a shame that people left so quickly because of the loot - tho for me (and I'm sure many others), I was exilerated from the adventure - and tho I may have liked an eyepatch to drop, it was of little consequence that one did not. It would have been fun to party in Vox's lair after the event, toasting her demise with some of Norrath's finest brew...perhaps next time :)<br>
<br>
My condolences to Skartaralin and Jex - it was bad that people didn't stick around for long enough to finish off the job once they saw nothing dropping for them. And you were very unlucky to not get more of a chance to hurt Vox Skartaralin, but please don't feel that you contributed nothing. Your presence made my raid more fun, and you were an asset to the team. I'd like to be by your side as you exact revenge on Vox next time!!<br>
<br>
I would like to add my congratulations to everyone on the raid - especially Kerna and deputies for organising it. It was a pleasure to fight alongside all of you, and I'd be proud to stand at your side when I hope we meet again.<br>

Was my first and only. I had been kiting in SF, when someone who I had never even spoken to before sent me a tell asking about a vox raid. I continued kiting and figured since there was a vox raid going on and I had nothing planned for the day, I'd give it a shot.<br>
<br>
   I found out who was leading the raid and sent him a tell asking if I can go, he agreed so I was on my way to Permafrost. While in North Karana, I met a warrior, Azeroth, who had also been running to Permafrost for the vox raid so we ran there together.<br>
<br>
   I had never been to Permafrost before, seeing as how it was way off in the distance. I had never had a need or urge to go there, so this would be my first trip there. <br>
<br>
   After being lost in Everfrost for about 15 minutes with Azeroth we finally stumped across the Permafrost zone by accident and met up with everyone else.<br>
<br>
   We headed in, buffed up, grouped everyone, and had the occasion fun stuff. Some people would mess around and tell jokes while others would intentionally train us with goblins to liven things up.<br>
   <br>
   Finally we began moving in. Seemed like forever until we finally got to the buffing hall. A few people had messed up the pulls, others had pets which aggroed vox, etc. Typical stuff for us back then, we didn't know any better.<br>
<br>
   After about an hour of buffing up and moving to the chat room it was finally time to move into Vox's lair. We all logged in and got ready to charge. I had borrowed tons of resist gear from a friend, so wasn't really concerned with being feared or AE'd. I was a 52 druid with about 100 unbuffed MR and CR, which I then had Circle of SUmmer and bard song.<br>
<br>
   Charging Vox had to be the most incredible thing I've seen in this game. It was the first major mob I had ever attempted. I ran in and immediately noticed about 4 corpses and kind of realized we wouldn't take her. As i stood back healing for the first few seconds I saw more and more people being feared right by me and more and more people dying all over the lair. Then i heard my command. Nuke! I ran in landed 2 Starfire's off on Vox before she sent me back to the orb in TT. Lucky for us there had been no necro's on the raid, which made the CR incredibly slow.<br>
<br>
   I ran back to Perma naked, and tried to meet up with everyone at the gates leading to the forst giants. Little had I realized there was no one in the zone except me, and I ran just run into my inevitable death. I died again to the hands of the goblins seeing as how i didn't have gate up and didn't know my way around the zone well enough to escape. I lost that corpse and didn't receive a rez. I became frustrated and decided to log.<br>
<br>
   The next day I received help from a friendly necro which i was guilded with, and got a rez from a cleric that had camped in Permafrost.<br>
<br>
   Although, it wasn't a triumphant experience, it was a great one. Now i read these posts and everyone takes down Vox and Naggy. /shrug For real fun you gotta lose sometimes, don't make it look too easy! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
