Training spectres in Oasis. Guilty or Not Guilt</span><hr size=1> What I dont understand is the people that agrue for the guy.<br>
<br>
He admitted he was training (his charactor was).  Regardless of who was playing it, he is still responsible for the actions of his charactor.  If you let someone have access to your account you run the risk of having someone ruin your rep.  Thats the risk HE took.  His shitlisting is deserved, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
The people saying this is not shitlistable based on the level of the people being trained are boggling my mind as to how they are trying to rationalize that...  How would you like it if your 50 level charactors were trained repeatedly?  well it sucks for people that are playing at any level.  I agree that the xp loss at these levels doesnt compare, it of course takes alot longer to regain xp at higher levels.  I dont believe that in any way can be used to justify taking 30 odd level mobs over teen level players intentionally.<br>
<br>
If I was on an alt in oasis then and this happened you can bet this would have ended up here.  You all were newbies too once, yah the zones are lame, yah some of the people suck.  Training to get people killed is still shitlistable plain and simple.<br>
<br>
In my opinion If your not high enough to kill the 4 specs on the corners of the island yourself at once, or are with a group I dont think you should be trying to kill them in oasis.  There are just to many people your gonna get killed.<br>
<br>
P.S.  I have seen 22 level players shouting for a 49 xp rez paying 200pp in loio just last night.  Why I dont know, but whoever says people dont shout for them at these levels is incorrect.  If you were saying they shouldnt be shouting for them then I would agree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=icecap>Icecap</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/01 1:11:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrak.

That was the most waste of a virtual piece of paper that I have ever seen.   You flame (off topic might I add) about how we are all a bunch of whiners about EXP loss, then you admit to trying to get a REZ at lvl 22?  Then you throw in something about how a bard trained you, and you DIDNT shitlist him? Excuse me pal, but that is in NO way related to this at all. Only thing you proved by this post is that you should do your self a favor and everyone else by saving that 10 bucks a month, go buy a bunch of clues, and a weight reducing hat that will make that ego of yours less heavy.<br>

Training spectres in Oasis. Guilty or Not Guilt</span><hr size=1> What I don't understand is why people can't remember that not every low lvl these days is a twink. I don't know about some of you other higher lvl people, but I remember my pre 20 days very clearly...in fact I think I still have nightmares about them. <br>
<br>
When I first started playing, (on Bristlebane server) EQ was still a baby, pre Kunark, and lvl 50 was god. Oasis was the place to be thru lvl 25. I didn't know any high lvl characters and I worked for everything I had. The experience loss then for me was a HUGE blow. I remember it took over 6 months for me to even get to lvl 20. I had limited time to play and so when someone was training to docks or orc highway or whatever you bet your ass I was pissed. I just can't believe that there are so many people here being all high and mighty about everything and saying stuff like &quot;you can make that exp back in 20 minutes&quot; For an untwinked character that has to run their asses back from Freeport or wherever they're bound, it most certainly is longer than 20 minutes. It's hard being a true newbie...so show a little compassion will ya?<br>
<br>
Assholes are assholes no matter what their lvl, best catch them while they're young and hope to whip them into shape, and if it really was &quot;a friend&quot; playing his character then he learned his lesson the hard way about sharing his account. People play this game to have fun, the whole idea of the shitlist is to warn us about the dickheads that like to ruin other people's fun, whatever their methods for doing it may be, training, scamming, ninjalooting...whatever. Consider yourself warned against this one and LEAVE THE POOR N00BS ALONE! Being a n00b sucks bad enough without having higher lvls telling you that your problems don't matter. <p>Faele Narsilion<Br>Uber Druish Princess of the 52nd Wandering<Br>First Officer and Consort <Br>Dogmatic Crucible<Br><Br><Br><b><i>Funny...she doesn't LOOK Druish......<b><i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigottomuchgameforyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>igottomuchgameforyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/01 5:52:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrak.

IM SOOO sorry for flaming flamers, really you come to there defense rather valiantly. Why don't you quote me some more its rather entertaining. Or better yet come up with some material of your own and quit showing off your html prowess.  <br>
<br>
You have given me a source of entertainment and a actual want to check this thread to see what other worthless babble you can sprout. Anyhow why don't you address real issues and quite flaming the people who flame the flamers so to say. <br>
<br>
What a peice of work you must be.<br>
<br>
For the people who know me know the level of integrity that I bring to this game.  But enough bashing I'm sorry If I have offended you or any others with my posts. <br>
<br>
Trading posts with you over this topic or any other seems rather not worth it for some reason. Reminds me of talking to a 5 year old who thinks he knows everything or someone who has taken a severe blow to the head.<br>
<br>

<br>
lol I like calling people slick now, it has a certain amount of disrespect and attitude in it learned that from you I guess.<br>

Im sorry Im guilty of flaming I guess, I flamed peoples opinions that this this is not a valid SL post. Well guess im guilty as charged.<br>

My necro DID NOT get a rez but do you see me up here crying to the lanys community that your low ass stupid shit alt got trained...NO.

Tyral same to you, lord knows I dont like you never have never will.

Prolly both cause by the sounds of things you need it.  I actually didnt know you were icebot till just the other day. Your IM logs are rather funny seems you have masterd the art of being a total f00king ass monkey here as well as IM conversations.  Funny though reeeally funny. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzulander.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zulander </A> at: 12/28/01 10:54:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=icecap>Icecap</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/29/01 12:07:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrak.

But Zulander if you really want to 'try' and flame me bring it to Zeraths Site it doesnt belong here, you are familiar with my work so you know what to expect come prepard bud. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubraktalk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Braktalk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/29/01 2:57:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrak.

<br>
If someone appologizes, why can't we accept it? Is it really that hard? Be forgiving. People make mistakes, we are only human.<br>

Aren't you supposed to be able to post your opinion and not have to worry if someone is going to flame you for it?<br>
<br>
Yes this guy trained specs four times, yes he said his friend was playing his character, yes he is still responsible for his characters actions regardless who was playing (he said he takes responsibility), yes he apologized.  <br>
<br>
I think this post did was it was intended to do, it told a story and us, as the readers, get to decide for ourselves if we think this is a bad guy or not.  I for one do not think this guy is bad.  No one else has posted on this thread saying that he has done other horrible stuff.<br>
<br>
To the people who are bashing on ice and igotta, i say just leave them alone.  They were just posting their opinion to begin with.  They shouldn't get attacked for how they think.<br>
