<br>
Pretty much all the clerics I know are honorable, but, just to keep us covered, let us discuss some ideas for rules on people who need it.<br>
<br>
My suggestion is, first come/first serve. If you are the first cleric at the camp, awaiting the spawn, then, you get first shot at it when it POPS. If the person leaves the camp, then, the next person in line gets the lead spot. Now, most of us have enough people in their debts that we could form an attack force pretty fast. What would be a reasonable time to give some one to call troops in before letting the next person call their people in? 15? 30 min?<br>
<br>
Also, and, this is just my opinion, I am looking for feedback, I think that it should be the cleric him/herself that waits. (is this practical? I have not done it yet, so do not know.) Should the person be allowed to have a guildmate hold the spot for him/her? i.e. A monk with FD?<br>
<br>
I am posting this, looking for suggestions. Ragefire is our bottleneck, and, if we discuss things civil now, it may prevent problems in the future.<br>
<br>

It is inherently unfair to the more casual player. I think it need to be whoever get there first, with makings of a raid, gets to take a crack at him. To me the making of a raid is a group or two there in zone. Ragefire is not that difficult a mob. I think there should be a reasonable time limit to &quot;get started&quot;. Maybe an hour or 2. After that it should pass to the next person who was in zone with the same &quot;raid making&quot;. <br>

The reason I do not totally agree with that is because that promotes Might Makes Right. I am pretty lucky, I have alot of friends, and, I could probably pull togeather alot of people fairly fast. But, what of that cleric who was there 4 hours before me? They put in the dedication to camp and wait. If they had Logged, it would default to my turn, but, they stayed. If I got a group of people there before they could, without giving them at least a fair shot at rallying their forces, then, that, in my humble opinion, would not be much better than Kill stealing. That is why I am getting input, to see what every one would agree on as fair. Killing Rage Faster will not make it Respawn any faster, so, time can be taken to get togeather forces, as long as it is reasonable. Giving some one 20-30 minutes to get their raiding party set would not be too bad, and, you can call your own forces too if you think they will not have the Man(Woman) Power to do it. How would you feel if you were a cleric in a smaller guild, that did not have some of the resources that the more Ubar Guilds did? You showed your dedication, camped the spawn and held your spot for I do not know how many hours, and, some one else, who had more firepower available came in 10 minutes after he spawned, and just took him, cuz you did not have the same network? I am just looking for a way to make it fair for all. The Casual player, as you say, would not be showing the dedication to camp the spawn, and, if he did, then, he should have a chance to get it.<br>
<br>
When Celina went for Ragefire, she accidently gave her Pearl to some ones Pet. Elmedico was in the background, ready to do his epic too. BUT, he did not rush it. When it was realized that a mistake was made, him, and his group waited patiently, to give Celina time to resolve the mistake. They waited probably at least a half hour or so, till we came to the conclusion that, at that point in time, there was nothing we could do. At that point, Elmedico took his turn, and, I assume got what he needed. The point is, he acted with Honor.(/cheer Elmedico)  Sure, he could have just pushed in when she accidently gave the shimmering pearl to the pet. He did not tho, and still got what he wanted. If he had gone about it diffrerent, the loss of a good reputation would have soured the whole epic experience.<br>
<br>

Yes it will.  When Ragefire dies, the respawn timer is reset.  You can have several Ragefire killings between Nagafens, so it benefits everyone to kill him as quickly as possible.<br>

Your goal is noble, but all you're going to do here is get some agreement from some people, and others will completely ignore your agreement, causing bad feelings on both sides, and probably more spam of the shitlist.<br>
<br>
You pointed out that there was sufficient restraint and nobility displayed in the case of Celina and Elmedico, and that's probably what you're going to have to hope for when it's your turn.<br>
<br>
The answer to your question unfortunately is that might does indeed make right under the rules that Verant has given us.  The way that might is exercised is completely up to the individual who holds the shimmering pearl. <p><img src="http://nomaru.homestead.com/files/SigPigs/Gtathsig.jpg">

I am at the same stage now. But to be honest, I'm only at this stage after two months needing the Chardok note because my good and very selfless friend Ellyria gave me a note she had looted via multiquesting to get the pearl. Motivation to complete this quest has really been lacking for me. No loot item is worth making one feel awful, and I feel, that is how things might end up.<br>
<br>
You see, I like Erikia's idea, mostly because it shows common decency to others. Worthy's plan too seems reasonable. But look at Gtath's statement, made without malice, I know, that Verant makes Might Right. Well, no, it doesn't make it *right*, it just makes it *legal*. Players make decisions on how they act, not Verant, Verant just takes no responsibility. In some ways, I cannot blame them, it keeps them out of lots of messy issues that they don't want to get into.<br>
<br>
The idea that I might spend 10 hours camping a spawn, only to have it pop and me need 30 mins or more to gather friends and others to help me kill it, because I am in a guild of 4 or 5 high level players, and worse because this is a roleplayed character who may not ask 25% of characters due to her own alignment grouping restrictions (and their friends who won't come if the former can't), only to have some (in my view) rude and greedy person bring their guild in because they arrived 10 mins before he popped and saw it, and having far faster mobilization than I can ever match, just sickens me. I know most players are not ever that rude, but some are, and thats a fact. So ultimately, though I do not agree with Gtath's statement that Verant makes Might Right, I do know the thrust of his point is &gt; some will ignore any decent agreement made by others, JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN.<br>
<br>
Time will tell. Good luck Worthy and Erikia, if I do start this camp sometime soon, if I arrive to find you camping it first, sitting in the Lair of the Dragon, I'll either leave wishing you good luck, or join to aid your quest. I'd certainly come to help either of you kill him for your epics, if you asked it.<br>
<br>
Some day Verant might I mean just might make an insta-spawn varient of this dragon, perhaps harder to kill, and that will give those of us every bit as dedicated and skilled as the big guild powergamers but who play a different style a decent shot at this, without having to face the less honourable and more greedy elements of the community whom we tend to otherwise avoid in our gaming.<br>
<br>

The idea of “might makes right” is generally unpopular, but I also don’t care for a system of “massive free time makes right.”  At any given time, there are likely to be multiple clerics wanting to kill Ragefire, and it is also likely that some of them will have the ability to camp the spawn for long periods of time (they’re students off for the summer, they’re kids, they don’t work outside the home, etc.)  Others of us may only be able to camp a few hours here and there.  I’m not inclined to participate in a system that does not give the casual player a reasonable shot at a Ragefire spawn.<br>
<br>
Here’s a thought: what if there were a cap on the amount of time you were entitled to camp before letting someone else have a shot?  You could show up and you’d have, say, two hours to wait for the spawn.  If no one else is around after two hours, you can wait as long as you like.  But if another cleric shows up after your two hours (or whatever the period is), then he gets a “shift,” and so on.  That way the “spawn chances” would be spread out among the various people wanting to kill Ragefire, rather than given entirely to the person who can log on the earliest and stay on the latest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Should the person be allowed to have a guildmate hold the spot for him/her? i.e. A monk with FD?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I definitely don’t think this should be permitted.  If someone wants to walk an FD’er into the lair and let the computer run for hours, that’s fine, but I don’t see how that should create any special priority for killing Zordak.<br>

The truth is that the reward will go to the individual who is the most efficient at executing the required tasks.  If you don't think you can &quot;beat out the other guy&quot;, then either you will be waiting in line for a long time, or you need to learn how to marshal your forces more efficiently. <br>
<br>
If you are faster or more efficient than someone who is &quot;in front of you&quot;, you have every right within the rules of the game to blaze ahead and do your thing.  It is up to you at that moment to decide if you will stand down and give someone else their chance before you.<br>
<br>
My friends, trying to make rules in this thread is an exercise in futility, because there will always be some other cleric who doesn't agree to be bound to these &quot;rules&quot; that you all agree to here, and prefers to follow the rules to which we are all bound as a function of playing the game. <p><img src="http://nomaru.homestead.com/files/SigPigs/Gtathsig.jpg">

Gtath, no-one is entitled to their epic weapon (or any item), of course not, and no-one said they were, nor implied it.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately you are 100% right, not all have any sense of honour and self-respect. Some are motivated by pure greed and/or enjoy the feeling of power/bullying others. So ok, in EQ it is LEGAL to do as you describe with no regard, but it does not make it reasonable or convey any respect with others. Indeed, the only people who respect it are the others who advocate it because they are both greedy and feel they can benefit by it.<br>
<br>
Your summary is sadly probably true. It is *probably* an excercise in futility. But good on Worthy et al for trying anyway. And those who just use force to override another will likely be publically lambasted for the greedy self-important individual that they are (not that that type will care, mind).<br>

&quot;why make rules for decent clerics to follow when others will simply steamroll them?&quot; - Yayger<br>
<br>
Why not try to make those rules anyway? Luclin did and it is working (at least, at the moment). Why give in and let the greed mob force everyone to act the same way? Being honourable is sometimes its own reward, I would say. And the reputation of those who don't give a *^&amp;%$ for others is not going to get any better, now, is it? Personally, if I have to steal the camp by force from anyone else in a rude and aggressive manner to be able to complete this (or any) quest, I would not want to complete it at all, my dignity is worth more to me than that. And I am pretty sure this is the case for most players.<br>
<br>
&quot;And be prepared for non-clerics to fight for Ragefire as well.&quot; - Leolan<br>
<br>
Are you suggesting a non-cleric would do the whole cleric epic quest in order to kill Ragefire? Or that they would just kill the NPC when he pops out of malice? I'm missing something here, I think.<br>

So I'm going to kick it back into action. <br>
<br>
First off: I am not a Cleric - I hope this means that my views will be un-biased. I will propose the guidelines so that everyone else may then begin to argue over it. <br>
<br>
1) That Ragefire be treated like a camp with the camper having the right to kill. But only Clerics should have the right to camp him - ie: no monks or rogues can claim the camp... heck no other class save the cleric. <br>
<br>
2) Once the mob pops - said Cleric will be given 30 minutes to assemble forces, (that's 30 minutes from pop) if the attack is not started in 30 minutes, whoever has the next ready and waiting attack force should then ask for the right to attack. The original camper should then give permission for the second in line to attack. Note: In the event that there are SEVERAL secondary forces in waiting - the right goes to the MOST POWERFUL force assembled... basically - once Rage pops - it's a race to see who can assemble the largest strikeforce... to calculate the requirements for largest strikeforce - Take all assembled players in the force - deduct 35(an arbritary number I plucked from thin air) from their levels then add the totals - highest value wins. <br>
<br>
3) If the original camper is mere minutes away from beggining his assault the original camper may ask for 5 minutes grace. At the end of those 5 minutes - he either lands a blow and plays the price or seceeds the assault to the secondary camper. The Secondary camper (the largest force present) must immediately begin the attack. Only a few minutes - say 5 will be allowed for buff stage - after which the attack must begin. Or it goes to the next largest force. Which may be the forces of the original camper.<br>
<br>
Conduct before pop:<br>
<br>
4) In the event a Cleric comes to camp the mob and finds another Cleric sitting there (thus claiming the camp) the newly arrived cleric may ask the currently camping cleric to state the list of camping clerics and ask to have his name added.<br>
<br>
5) The currently camping cleric must list everyone on the list in proper order... and THEN check to make sure that everyone on the list is still online... anyone who cannot be contacted should be stricken from the list, to allow for LDs or zoners plyers should be given 5 minutes before the name is stricken from the list.<br>
<br>
6) Both the camping cleric and the newly arrived cleric will make note of the list - every cleric must contact every other cleric on the list so everyone knows who is next.<br>
<br>
7) When the camping cleric has had enough - he then calls the next on list to take his spot - he must also inform EVERY other cleric on the list about who is taking over. If the next on list is unable to take over -then go down the list.<br>
<br>
Edit: number 8 was taken out becuase it was a stupid rule to have in place. To read it - check Rugen's post.<br>
<br>
Hypothetical situations and the rules in action:<br>
<br>
eg: FirstAid comes to the camp and finds no one there... FirstAid then begins the camp, a short while later SecondHeaven shows up... SecondHeaven asks FirstAid for list, FirstAid tells SecondHeaven he is next on list. SecondHeaven may now do as he wishes, though he probaly should keep FirstAid company. But lets say Second Heaven wanders off. ThirdLife shows up for camp, finds FirstAid there and asks for list.<br>
<br>
The list looks like this:<br>
FirstAid<br>
SecondHeaven<br>
<br>
FirstAid tells ThirdLife, he is second on list after SecondHeaven. Both FirstAid and ThirdLife contact SecondHeaven to make sure he is on-line.<br>
<br>
SecondHeaven must reply ASAP. Both FirstAid and ThirdLife should keep trying to contact SecondHeaven. After 5 minutes... with no response from SecondHeaven, then SecondHeaven is stricken from the List.<br>
<br>
The list now looks like this:<br>
FirstAid<br>
ThirdLife<br>
<br>
Lets say SecondHeaven returns to camp one hour later and finds FirstAid still there. SecondHeaven asks to take the camp. FirstAid will tell him that he is now SECOND on list after ThirdLife (but first they must make sure ThirdLife is still online). Let's say Third Life is still on line.<br>
<br>
The list now looks like this:<br>
FirstAid<br>
ThirdLife<br>
SecondHeaven<br>
<br>
20 hours later First Aid gives up and hands the camp to ThirdLife. FirstAid must now inform everyone on list that he is leaving camp so that everyone may alter the list accordingly. Update the list for those who have gone missing or no show accordingly... those giving up the camp should inform everyone else 10 minutes before they have to go so that the 5 minutes seek time can be fully used. ThirdLife then takes the camp. I would suggest that everyone on the list head to the camp though... well all those close to being next in line. <br>
<br>
The reason is this:<br>
<br>
So that they can inform everyone else of the list - preferably the camping cleric should wait till the next in line is there...<br>
<br>
Let's say that ThirdLife is now owner of the camp - but is taking his time getting there. During this time... SecondHeaven is at the camp and Ragefire pops. SecondHeaven must now inform everyone on list that Ragefire has popped and so the 30 minute timer has started. ThirdLife now has 30 minutes from the time SecondHeaven informs everyone of the pop to attack Ragefire. If ThirdLife arrives within 30 minutes and is almost ready - he may have the 5 minutes grace to land the blow.... failing that the LARGEST strike force available now has 5 minutes to land the blow.<br>
<br>
Let's say that after 30 minutes - ThirdLife is not yet in zone - he's in EC and desperately runnig to the camp. At this point I'd like to ask whoever has their strikeforce in place to be lenient BUT - to prevent people from taking a lackadasical attitude - they now have the RIGHT to attack Ragefire ... this is 30 minutes after pop - and the camping cleric not being present. Note that is is the CAMPING CLERIC ON THE LIST that MUST be present. If his strikeforce is present but not HIM/HER then the right to attack goes to the next force. Moral: do not delay in getting to the camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hopefully those hypothetical situations helped clear things up.<br>
<br>
<br>
FINALLY: the 0th rule<br>
<br>
As has been pointed out - guilds/groups who are powerful enough need not pay any attention to the *proposed* rules of conduct. But if a sizable portion of you clerics out there rattify this proposal then the party that decides to dis-regard these rules of conduct will do so at the risk of upsetting the rest of the Cleric community. <br>
<br>
It ain't prettey - but it's better than FFA.<br>

But it was kinda fun going through the thought process... I blame the error trapping and documentation practices I put into my software for that! hehe... now if only Verant would spend more time thinking through these trivial matters... like stacking effects with AoE and Rez...<br>

Would avoid a lot of problems.<br>

<br>
&quot; If any force fails... to kill Ragefire - they should step down and let the next force have a go. Failure is defined by no one attacking Ragefire for 30 seconds or more. (So there' no time to re-rez you attack force - if your force all dies - the next one steps up to the task)&quot;<br>
<br>
You are probably not aware that ragefire is spawned by turning in an item to him. An item, that if they did your above scenario? the cleric who failed would have to start his epic *completely* over to get again. So no, that above statement WON'T be happening anytime soon. Once a cleric turns in his pearl, Zordak is his til he's dead as far as I am concerned. <p><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/rugensig.jpg"><br>

<br>
If you fail to kill Ragefire and start to rez peeps in,he can and has(on me =/ ) despawn.<br>
<br>
Leading to me and anyone else who fails having to completely redo the quest from the beginning.<br>
<br>
As far as camping the spawn....if you have that much free time on your hands.....<br>
