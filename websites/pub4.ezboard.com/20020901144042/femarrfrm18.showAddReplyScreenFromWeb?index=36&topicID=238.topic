Prosecute!</span><hr size=1> Couple points to add to your fire, since I am reading this and wouldn't mind your opposing views : These are directed to any and all btw<br>
<br>
1)  Do you feel Clinton was justified in lying about the BJ?<br>
<br>
2)  Do you feel that Clinton should have been punished for the actual perjury?  If so, what punishment would have been appropriate and why?<br>
<br>
3)  Do you feel the trial should have waited till he was out of office due to the nature of it?  (Personal)<br>
<br>
4)  Do you feel we (as the people and including our congressmen whom we elect to represent us) should never investigate the personal life of the President while he is in office?<br>
<br>
5)  Do you feel that it is appropriate for a sitting President to lie, even if he may not get caught in it?<br>
<br>
6)  Do you feel it is appropriate for a sitting President to lie only about personal issues?<br>
<br>
7)  As the president is our Chief Executive officer and is our Ambassador to the World, do you feel that a known liar, such as Clinton, was a good choice (in retrospect)?  Please answer based on his own merits, not in comparisons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Does anyone here feel that the way in which we conduct ourselves in our personal life is usually if not often the way we conduct ourselves in our professional life as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I'll answer first <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1) No.<br>
2) Yes, but not until he was out of office.  Whatever the law requires and then let his lawyers work.  (I believe in most states this includes jail time, which I am sure in his case would have been community service).  I believe he should have been punished once out of office because if it had been the average person on the stand, they would have been called upon this and punished by the court of law.<br>
3) Yes.<br>
4) No.  I feel if the circumstances show a need for investigation it should be done, however witchhunts are not necessary.<br>
5) No.<br>
6) No.  A president should not lie while in office.  Period.  <br>
7) As a person, no.  I do not feel he was a person of good moral character, I do not feel he was a good Ambassador to the world.  However, I do agree with many things he did while in office, and I feel he did a good job in the actual running of the country.  I am sure someone could point out many failings and explain why its really someone else's fault or someone else deserves the credit, but /shrug.  From the knowledge I have of the situation, he was a pretty good Chief Exec.  It is embarrassing though to know that when he went to other countries, they knew all about his sex life.  I mean, don't you wonder how often he had to discuss that first in his dealings with other exec's?  &quot;yes, Mr. Chinese Leader, my wife and I are having some marital difficulties, I thank you for your marraige help book, entitled how to keep it in your pants when you've got lots of pressure on you.&quot;  I often wonder how much difficulty that caused.  I am sure though that the other leaders always asked themselves &quot;I wonder if he's lying to me?&quot;  Course they probably had to ask to that before too, since all politicians lie.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I do feel that the way in which a person conducts themselves in their personal life, is indeed, reflected in their professional life.  That is why, in my opinion, many people were so upset with Clinton and all the many scandals he had during his presidency.  We are not talking about Kennedy or anyone else, I am sure all Presidents have had scandals or potential scandals.  Most of us have in our lives as well.  We all know inside, I think, that if someone lies about little things at home to their Mom, Dad, Wife, or Dog, that they most likely will lie about at least the little things at work and school, etc.  And maybe the big things too.  After all, if lying is ok, or justifiable, then we can rationalize it away.  The line for where it truly becomes wrong is always below where we are standing.  <br>
<br>
So, now that the truth was out - OMG Clinton LIED! -  and we could no longer pretend to ourselves that our President wasn't actually this great super human being who was perfect.  Damnit!  We were so disappointed to discover he's actually a human, just like you and me!  Wow.  /sarcam off<br>
<br>
Really, I think he should not have lied.  Of course, I think he should not have cheated on his wife.  <br>
<br>
I think we SHOULD have a moral person in office, one of good moral character.  I don't think wanting that, or demanding he be punished for breaking the law is a bad thing, as seems to be the trend.  I think he should have been given the same damn sentence I would have gotten ahd I lied on the stand.<br>
<br>
Yes, I feel people were out to get Clinton, but that doesn't excuse his behavior nor does it justify his lying.  Whether you steal a loaf of bread because you feel like it, or because you are hungry, you are still a thief.  One might be justified, but you'd probably still get some type of punishment because the law had been broken.  In Clinton's case, the lying was not justified.  His behavior, even though in his personal life, was inexcusable.  Face it folks, he screwed up.  He did.  Admit it.  He broke the law.  Why he was hunted down, why his trial happened, why he was almost forced out of office, it all becomes moot when you consider that he was guilty.  Do I feel the punishment exceeded the crime (or the almsot punishment of impeachment)?  Yes.  Lying is wrong, but in his case, was not impeachable in my opinion. <br>
<br>
Only one quote I want to include here:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  As long as Bible-thumping moralist shitheads such as yourself continue to approve Congressional witchhunts targetted at our chief of state, the chief of state will continue to do what is necessary to secure the office they are given.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I know lots of people who believe Clinton was morally wrong, and they are not Church goers or bible thumpers as stated here.  Whether they approved the so called witch hunt or not, I dont know, but lets not generalize too much here.  <br>
<br>
Also, having a Chief of State who does whatever is necessary in order to keep his office is NOT a good trend IF you are stating the following.  If you mean - the president should use any means necessary in order to avoid scrunity and accountability in his life while he is in power - I do not agree with you at all.  <br>
<br>
Lets use an analogy.  Would you want someone teaching your child who was an admitted child molester?  How about a child abuser?  How about a teacher who has contributed to the deliquency of a minor?  How about a teacher who has lied for example, on the stand, about a personal issue in their sex life, perhaps whether they had sex with an 18 year old student right after graduation?  I hope your answer would be no, you really wouldn't want this kind of person teaching your child if you had a choice.  Why?  They have had an admitted moral charachter flaw and you wouldn't want them teaching your kid in case your child learned something you didn't want them too - you don't want that variable in their life.<br>
<br>
How about this?  Would you want a CEO in your company who was a known embezzler?  One who was accused of embezzling?  one who lied ont eh stand during an embezzling case?  Might you not be a bit concerned about that and how it might affect the company,  and hence your job at the very least?<br>
<br>
How much more then, does the President represent.  How much more does his character, personally, and that of the office in general, affect his leadership of our country?<br>
<br>
It does affect it.  how much I am not sure.<br>
<br>
Now, please answer the above questions.  Not sure who's quote that was, I copied it and hit a general reply.  Notice that I am not defending anyone here, not flaming anyone, and not really supporting anyone.  Just gave my own opinion on the matter.  Now, I'd love to read yours clearly stated and please include reasons why you chose what you did.  <br>

<br>
2) No. Should we punish you if you claim your dog didn't lick out your pussy when you let it and were too embarassed to admit you put the peanut butter down there for it to lick?<br>
<br>
3) Yes. Peanut butter licking episodes or the like are private affairs and I could care fucking less what Bill did privately.<br>
<br>
4) Yes. The President should be allowed to slap his salami at will in the Oval office on the Queen of England if he and her likes and we the public should never care to know about it.<br>
<br>
5) All Presidents lie Lukaria. Where have you been? Have you ever lied Lukaria? Why do you expect more from your president?<br>
<br>
6) Yes. Don't you lie about your weight Lukaria? You are a female aren't you?<br>
<br>
7) Yes, in retrospect Clinton was a good choice. Under his terms we saw more economic gains than what was delivered under any other President since Truman in US history.<br>
<br>
8) Oops there is no eight! hehehe<br>
<br>
Lukaria let me ask you some questions.<br>
<br>
1) How much do you weigh?<br>
<br>
2) What is your height?<br>
<br>
3) What race are you?<br>
<br>
4) When was the last time you had sex?<br>
<br>
5) Do you ever rub your pussy too hard?<br>
<br>
6) Are you a lesbian or have you ever been with a lesbian or have you ever licked out a vagina?<br>
<br>
7) Do you find the above questions to abusive and personal?<br>
<br>
8) Why would you allow your congressmen to ask such questions of your President and or other members of the government?<br>
<br>
Is my point well taken? I hope so.<br>
