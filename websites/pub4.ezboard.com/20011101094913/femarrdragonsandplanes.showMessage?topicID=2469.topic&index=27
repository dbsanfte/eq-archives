Stumpf I was reading back through your list of demands... I just have to laugh... we should have demanded all that cause for us just to hand over a plane to you and us to benafit I think those demands would be just <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   However I was not part of the nagotiation but I do know that Hippocrates nor Toran would ask of such a thing except taking Toran to get his epic piece and maybe the VS spawn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

and one more thing you keep talking about a Monk you can ask any of the people in our guild that was there, we didn't have a Monk with us...

I know many SF I am not flaming you but the 2 people that were giving demands were Hippocrates and Toran... does that sound like something they would demand?&quot;<br>
<br>
Umm YES actually it does sound like Toran!<br>
<br>
Not long ago Vivix and CBA were at the druid ring in LS gathering a naggy raid and LOF walked right past us after porting into the midst of us setting up groups. <br>
<br>
They had maybe 1 group of people 46 to 52 rest were over 52. They asked to let them help us and then in return they take over loot and let everyone even the level 60 warrior and druid that did not even help buff roll on loot. Now normally just because I am in zone I don’t get to roll on loot so why is it ok for others to do so?<br>
<br>
Toran won his Burnt book on that raid at level 55 and did jack shit for it. Then had the nerve to ask me to run a Vox raid for his frost book.<br>
<br>
His rep is so shot to hell at this point people threaten to leave raids if he is allowed to go. Sound bad doesn’t it however he tried to do this same damn thing to a hole raid not too long ago. We had people in zone for several hours waiting for us to finish VS. He knew why they were there they told him why they were there and he still tried to get his people down faster. <br>
<br>
Side note about that raid: Level 60 warrior along for the raid and Toran level 55 pally was MA ? WTF<br>
<br>
We were down and done in 45 mins they hadn’t made it to golem house yet.<br>
<br>
Rant all you want about how your so picked upon however a lot of the people LOF has been shitting on for months couldn’t give a rats ass when someone else gets sick of your shit and ignores your bizarre demands.<br>

how do you explain the 15 people that were there when the first group of Affliction went up? Did you watch them all port up? did you do a who all Legion of Fate... How do you KNOW for a fact that NO ONE was there<br>
NO ONE meaning not one person... lol<br>
<br>
Another thing the whole LoF guild was not up there and I can't tell you if someone was going to Hate or not...<br>
I am giving all these NAMES how about a name of the person that said that and I will ask them if they said it...<br>
<br>
You can highlight all your own words all you want but how about names to go with YOUR facts? Lets ask these people and get them involved to tell their story as well... <p><img src="http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0NAAlAMcSVOnZKy3eL50tUVzyNwzAERJqUqEvujnob*gBU9a!OTJVGLf1!g5woYO9!uv73qI3e17354XAlnjI7g/Nickoli.jpg" border="0"><br>

I ask this because Anlah'Shok Was up there from 8pm cst to about 4am cst.  This morning I jumped from PoA at 10am Cst alone in PoA.  I was ALL ALONE.  I know this cause I checkedto make sure that ALL my guild had left.  <br>
<br>
I also know that afflication wanted to come up last night but due to the fact that we where there they did not.  They respected us as we respected them -- cause we sent them a tell when we left the plane.  <br>
<br>
Those are facts that I know where there before anyone else.  As to what happened after that I have no clue.<br>

This isnt including the keys that you can buy from the key master for 250pp (with a charisma of 70).

When we see a group of LoF people port off after telling us they are going to Hate, we assume they are going to Hate.

Given many people's reactions at that point, we could have justifiably told you to EAD and not even offered anything we did.  We had enough people to start clearing the islands and so we did so.  By the time myself and Lando got up there we tried to work out some sort of workable options for both guilds.  You started making unreasonable demands like we owed you something.  We wouldn't accept your demands.  We made our own suggestions, you wouldn't accept ours so we decided to move on and continue with our plans.<br>

<br>
Your attitude in a previous post already indicates that you think your guild should have received every concession under the moon and stars just because someone went in and moved past you (read the two guild thing again), an attitude that will not serve you well as you start butting heads with larger guilds who generally are already not happy about being inconvenienced by doing old plane runs for epics etc and are not in a mood to deal with people making demands.<br>
<br>
I think this post covers it well.<br>

The only LoF post that was eloquent and level-headed enough for me to read through was Faiith's.  <br>
<br>
LoF, Affliction isn't going to roll over and die.  You're gonna have to work out sharing zones in the future.  Shit happens, though it seems to me as a third person party they didn't do it on purpose.  Seems to me like everything happened because of miscommunication.  Realize that and realize it happens to the best of people.  Take a deep breath and let go.<br>

I did suggest randoming etc (see above) but only after I realized you weren't going to respect the time honor tradition of first come first served. BTW when did you actually arrive? After my guild leader, Hippocrates, and fellow officer, Toran, arrived. At which point they began discussions with Lando. And all I heard after that in guildchat was your guilds proposals to us. We did have one goal, get Toran his epic. That was our only &quot;demand&quot; as far as I knew. But, we should not have had to make any demands, but for the sad fact you bullied your way in.<br>
<br>
Perhaps since our discussions as a guild were with Lando, maybe this is the source of your mis-information (or in this case dis-information). It cetainly seemed to me he was dead set on taking the plane from us. I wouldn't be surprised if he fabricated some lies to get you folks riled up. <br>
<br>
Stumpf, ask yourself, &quot;Was I manipulated? Am I just a tool.. of landoh's greed?&quot;<br>
<br>
PS Aishen we DID try to work it out. Tried very hard to be civilized and adult. Landoh and a few others began the name calling, demand making and lying.<br>

Last time I checked, Hate stones and PoA stones are entirely different...and BTW WHO is THEY?!<br>
<br>
2) There was nobody in PoA.<br>
Not from what I heard in /gu, and what I know of thier planning.  But if I salves your pathetic concience to believe so, I don't particularlly care.  You're still wrong, and throwing enough BS, and he said she said, to cover up your own arrogance in Jumping a plane.<br>
<br>
3) LoF made demands such as &quot;Give us all the Experiance and Loot&quot;.  Sure they did!  They were just miserly greedy for beating you up there in the first place weren't they you....:::stops there::.  They did attempt to make some comprimise. <br>
<br>
As a guild (since we've learned the HARD way) we try and STFU when our raid leaders are discussing problems with Anyone.  They tried to arrange it so all are happy, and nobody's (and PP) were wasted.  Up to and including something like, &quot;You want the plane, take Toran (and 5 others) to get his epic piece.&quot;  &quot;Possibly since we're sending approx 24 people down with nothing to do, you could give us your next VS spawn&quot;.  Wasn't there (I overslept <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), but that's what I heard kicked around in /gu.  Basically the idea being batted around was, &quot;Let's not FU Toran's chance of his Epic, if Affliction wants the zone badly enough to pull this *&amp;*(^ .&quot;<br>
<br>
4) Monk Epic? WTF did you pull that out of?  The same foul smelling place you pulled the rest of this crap from.<br>
<br>
5) 24 keys drop...they had 10 to 15 keys, pulling up 2 to 3 more groups up for keys...and Affliction pulls up 28.  Do the math.<br>
<br>
Just a Load of BS and you know it, and AS for Toran's Rep...he'll do just fine, trust me.  I know there's others that have problems with me, but generally I try and be fair.  Hipp and Tor do more so than I, from what I've seen.  If there's problems with a naggy raid, or a vox raid arrangement...here's an idea, don't go.  But don't whine when you don't win phaat loot, when you do go.  There are a dozen more from those raids that think they were the bomb.  We had an excellent buff line, back up healers etc....  <br>
<br>
There are a lot of people that posted here (for and against) that I like, either on the board or in game.  Nobody's perfect, least of all me.  I get ticked off too...make references I understand, even though someone else may not.  But if I screw up, I'll state it....blush, apoligize, pay back if I have too.  SUCKS to, but I will/have.  This ticks me off.  Especially, when all it would have taken was a, &quot;Sorry man, tells got crossed.&quot;  Instead, the &quot;Agreed&quot; upon arrangement couldn't even be fullfilled, because someone else got so flippin JUMPY he despawned a mob.  Apparently there's someone else in the guild that can't listen for a *(&amp;(*&amp; to rules.<br>
<br>
Flame away....what did I mis-spell...what did I hit on that rang true, throw some more manure on it quick.  Can't have anyone knowing you may have *gasp* screwed up. <p><Center><IMG SRC="http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/sigs/belgar.jpg"><BR><IT>

<br>
No, Im sorry, I dont know who it was that said they were going to Hate.  Nothing against members of LoF but, I just don't know many of them or even know their names for the most part.  Before I was grouped with Hipocrates and Toran, I didn't even know your officers.  /shrug just never had run into them in game before that I remember.  So, long story short, I dun remember who the hell it was that said LOF was going to Hate.  I do know what I heard though.  And no offense Sage, but if you weren't there, and don't know what was said, or what we heard, do us all a favor and keep your nose out of other people's business.  It doesn't concern you.  <br>
<br>
I don't know who it was.  In a sea of chat spam going on at the time I, as well as quite a few other members of Affliction saw a member of LoF say they were going to Hate.  And, I understand you guys may have camped in Sky the night before (although Im still confused a bit on the time in which you had to do this) but when we got together and started checking things out, there was NO ONE IN THE PLANE OF SKY.  <br>
<br>
Kele: (just saw your response post) <br>
<br>
First off.. I was in Sro,  you know, listening to those guys down there like I already said?  We saw your groups port off....somewhere.  We ported a few folks up.  Instant replies in /guildchat  &quot;WTF, those LoF peeps that said they were going to Hate just popped in on the hottub&quot;<br>
<br>
Secondly... <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I suggest basic logic classes.

We're trying to have a logical (albeit heated) debate on what happened today and you were the first to drop to the personal attacks on me.  No more replies from me to you on this.  If you want to debate logic and reason some time with me little boy, I'll be more than glad to take it up with you in some other form.  In the meantime, I'm turning my concerns to the matters at hand.<br>
<br>
Oh, and nothing towards other members of LoF, but just so you now Know Kelewala FUCK YOU.  Does that make you happy?  mmmk.  Now we know where we stand with each other.  <br>

Other members of LoF, please continue anything you wish to debate about.  Be glad to try and hash this out with you all.<br>

<br>
But to be to the point, I have had occassion to have several grievances with how your guild operates with respect (or lack thereof) to others.<br>
<br>
My guild is among the least lootcentric of people you could hope to meet.  I think your insinuation of whiners for phat lewt on a dragon raid is uncalled for and poorly researched.<br>
<br>
Vivix Protectorate and our allies Clan Battle Axe had posted the raid.  Yes, we are aware that it is not a &quot;reservation&quot;.  Your guild presented to us the idea of &quot;unite and assist&quot;.  By itself, that was no reason for us to believe that we were going to be dealt with unfairly.  If we had any such cause to believe so, we would have left, no harm no foul.  Getting beat to the punch happens, and such is an inconvenient reality which we are aware of and have learned to face.<br>
<br>
However, we were offered &quot;assistance&quot;, that was the wording.  When the dragon fell, all of your guild in zone was then invited to roll.  This was NOT stated up front.<br>
<br>
A level 60 druid won the Hierophant's Crook in that roll.<br>
<br>
I don't think I need to explain that a 60 druid cannot take part in a Nagafen battle.<br>
<br>
So let's backtrack here.  Your guild offered to &quot;ally and assist&quot;.  It then proceeded to invent uncommon loot rules without doing us the courtesy of stating it up front.  Those loot rules were then imposed.<br>
<br>
However you choose to slice it, VP and CBA left feeling very very very ill-used.  A lesson for the future, bought with several hours of disappointment and frustration.<br>
<br>
Had your guild stated it's intention to run the raid, rather than &quot;ally and assist&quot;, it would have left us room for choice.<br>
<br>
Had your guild stated the loot rules, rather than gleefully divide the spoil of the mob on the spot, it would have left us room for choice.<br>
<br>
Your behaviour denied us both.  Your idea of fair loot rules may not coincide with ours, and that's your right which I won't even attempt to deny.  Yet you denied us our freedom to choose.<br>
<br>
By subverting.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I have both heard and seen with reliable proofs your guild's intention to fly in the face of the plans of others, in rampant disrespect for the Venril Sathir rotation.  You may refer to the threads in Dragons and Planes.<br>
<br>
Please allow me this moment to state my personal opinions on the matter.  The facts are already stated.<br>
<br>
It's your game as much as mine.  And you play it however you see fit.  I do not choose the play the game you play.<br>
<br>
You choose your friends, your guild, and your behaviour.  We are playing a game here.  You weren't born or bred to be Legion of Fate or play the game in the ways stated above.<br>
<br>
That said, like it or not, there will be a tendency to look upon a player or a person based on the reputation of their guild.  Guild affiliation reflects your choices and your character as a player and as a person.<br>
<br>
I do not know you.  And I empathize with your feeling flamed and slandered and otherwise defamed.<br>
<br>
But sir, there are clear proofs and facts for why someone (or several someones) would speak to you so.<br>
<br>
For all I know, you may be the nicest person on EMarr.  And that's a bloody shame to me.  You have chosen to keep company with people who play in ways which I (and evidently others) find distasteful, and for all I know there are some really nice people guilty of nothing more than lack of assertiveness that I'm missing out on.<br>
<br>
