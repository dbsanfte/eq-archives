<br>
  I think you unfairly assume that somehow everyone in the US playing EQ is a student or has alot of time. Caelie stated above that she works all day. Fendellar who camped this last works all day. I bet at least 40% of the clerics who camp RF work all day. People just work it out. You people on the other side of the world need to work and sleep, well so do we. Your assumption that the people of your guild have no time and everyone else does is outrageous. I don't disagree with the 30 minutes to engage thing, what I disagree with is your seeming unwillingness to actually think about this, and to support your guild in working out solutions that respect the whole community. Hell, AK is huge and EH is relatively small and low-level, but THEY made it go right to support their cleric for 5 or 6 days and get her an epic. Is AK not close-knit enough to do the same? <br>
<br>
  I don't want to flame anybody here or piss anyone off (hmm, too late?), but I wish you would put a little more thought into this. I understand your guild needs epiced clerics but, so do other guilds. If they somehow re-arrage their lives and support each other just based on friendship and comraderie then you might consider respecting that, and working towards being able to do that as a guild. You guy probably have enough people to take him out online almost all the time, and if  you don't then you could do what EH must have done. I bet that EH had to put some serious planning and get alot of cooperation from every 50+ member in order to keep a large enough force on all the time for week. I'm not trying to bring the wrath of AK down on me, but think about what you are saying please. If EH can do it it I think you can too.<br>

Who the fuck do you think you are? You're saying that you've arranged all the Ragefire camps for the next three weeks by agreement among yourselves. This bullshit cannot continue. At this point, I have zero respect for the camp and for the cozy arrangements that people are using to tie up the spawn.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your willing to take it FFA, but unless the majority of the guilds on this server agree, it will remain a camp most likely.  Caelie nor did EH make any agreements on further spawns.  Read any of my other posts, or talk with both PC, and Affliction's Mirakle.  Camp rules set by the server in general is that your there camping it and calling it first.  Mirakle from Affliction has been there for over 2 days before RF spawned for us, so she would be in line for the next camp.  EH did the same thing.  <br>
<br>
If you can't muster enough help to camp this thing from as large a guild as yours, nm I wont say what I think.  It about killed us to do what we did, but guess what we worked through it, and actually made it a little fun event for the guildies that showed up.  I dont think anyone expects the same person to play that cleric for 6 days straight.  You work, great so do I, and 90% of my guild.  That didnt stop us from making arangments. <br>
<br>
You think there are problems now?  Just wait till he goes FFA if he does.  The larger guilds on this server can gather and have him down before you probably even had time to call your friends and tell them to log on.  Right now at least you have the opportunity to do him, just gather 4 friends and split the time 6 hours each.  FFA gives you Jack and Shit at a chance at getting him.  Not to mention all the fights and rants that will come to the board because X guild got that faster then Y guild with their force, but y guild had 5 ppl in the zone first.  <br>

<br>
There are a lot of people waiting for one guild to disrespect this camp, then they're going to make some very trite comments to the guild in question, silently sigh to themself and then they're going to start to attempt to kill this mob day in day out.<br>
<br>
I think this is true of VS and Trak too.<br>
<br>
This is not an unwillingness to work the situation through but the inability to sit back and take it whilst other guilds who have more players not commited elsewhere plan the next 50 spawnings of RF.<br>
<br>
And as for the statement of assuming that all americans playing EQ do not have jobs that is incorrect. Nobody is saying that however it is a recognized fact that due to the cost of internet connection and hardware over here that very few students and people without jobs can afford to play. This is not true in America. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

  Caelie did not decide who gets the next camp, that was decided when the cleric sat down with her and spent the time there to ensure that it would be theirs.  So far, this has been the only way to ensure that you get the next camp.<br>

Wrong, it remains a respected camp only if everyone on the server continues to respect it.  You have it exactly backwards.<br>
<br>

Sure we could, but we have better things to be doing.  If your guild doesn't have better things to be doing with its time, nm I won't say what I think.<br>

<br>
Actually, that was the rule, wasn't it?  The cleric was supposed to be personally camping the spawn.<br>

<br>
And how is that different from about a hundred other spawns in the game?  If I have to choose between a six-day spawn with all sorts of cozy agreements among small guild clerics and the chaos of FFA, I'll take my chances with FFA.<br>
<br>
If someone out there wants to preserve the Ragefire camp, you'd better come up with a system that is fair and acceptable to everyone.  As of now, if anyone out there is sitting on your butt in Skyfire, you're on notice that your &quot;camp&quot; may not be worth jack shit. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

<br>
YES, it was indeed agreed that the actual cleric be there at the camp ONLINE for how ever long it took to camp the spawn.<br>
<br>
If that means having your husband call camp checks for you while you grab 2 hours sleep.. then thats what it was - but the actual cleric was **supposed** to be there.  <br>
<br>
However, as long as a group of guildies is there, it IS ok in cases of short /afk or LD.  I checked with a gm (not a guide) during my camp when I had gone LD for 20 min (took that long to get reconnected after re-booting)..  I was informed that if LD or /afk for a short time, it is permissable for a guildie/group member to call your camp checks.  <br>
<br>
If you never come back - thats a different story.  <br>
<br>
Gone for 8 hours at a time with the actual cleric not online?  Technically, not camped according to old rules, but if guildies/group there, then I personally would call it camped....<br>
<br>
<br>
I will say what we should do, imo, is to discuss this seriously with our guilds, and perhaps have an officer post here.  This obviously needs to be decided.  No one wants to be the bad guy, and no one wants to get their spawn ganked, and no one wants to wait 8 months for an epic.<br>
<br>
If rotation, kinda like Trak?<br>

Need some advice.</span><hr size=1> I think there is a part of me that knew that the rotation conversation would get fleshed out sooner or later.  As a system, it has enough precedence to deserve being considered as a viable alternative.<br>
<br>
VS and the wizzy staff are a similar sort of epic quest bottleneck, according to my understanding.  With two differences that I know of:  the wizzy staff does not always drop, and wizzy epics in not as much demand as rez sticks.<br>
<br>
I haven't weighed the whole thing out with what I would consider to be enough thought, so I'm interested to read people talk about it.<br>
<br>
I do see a couple of interesting advantages to a Ragefire rotations (even though I can not say I think the pros outweigh the cons, please see above paragraph <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
1.)  It addresses somewhat the issue of Draelyn, Aurorelle, and Sagemon insofar as it negates the need to brainlessly camp<br>
2.)  As a trade-off, it does put the squeeze on guilds such as ours who are not rotation capable, BUT becoming rotation-capable is a need and a goal that we have already needed to set long ago, so it really doesn't rock the boat so to speak.  It's just another reason to do what we already knew we had to do.<br>
3.)  It preserves the practice of powerful guilds agreeing among themselves<br>
4.)  It clearly defines what smaller/rising guilds need to do to get where they want to get<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts,<br>

<br>
An RF pick-up slot for smaller guilds.  It preserves the spirit of the VS pick-up slot, and leaves smaller guilds an avenue to be able to band together and outfit their people.  I've not fully considered the implications of perhaps allowing rotation guilds to assist in the battle.  Would love to hear thoughts on this one too.<br>

Need some advice.</span><hr size=1> Rotation will not happen of that I am 95% sure of as I know 2 strong guilds/alliances who will most likely NEVER again accept any form of rotation on any mob especially one as weak as Ragefire. Rotations do not in any way benifit the guilds in them who are any where near strong guilds. Right now the VS rotation itself has stretched to 19 guilds when it was never the reasoning behind its creation to help the smaller guilds but to lessen the infighting among the strongest. Now the guilds who started the rotation get one shot at VS every 60 or so days and thus never get to be &quot;Done&quot; with VS due to this sad rotation. I seriously doubt that those guilds will allow this to happen with Ragefire and get 25+ guilds on a rotation (Ragefire is weak enough that more guilds can kill him then VS) where they only get a Ragefire once every 5 months. Hell I am suprized that the VS rotation has lasted as long as it has but I see its end coming very soon. Most are waiting on just what Sagemon said. A single guild brave enough to face the flamestorm for other guilds to &quot;Blame&quot; (But privately thank) for &quot;destroying this good rotation&quot; (Read PoS rotation but they can't say that outloud as that would invite flames to them) and that the guild (Read Savior) would be persecuted for its horrible transgresion (Read aiding them immensly) as that will be what the EMarr populace (Read only the small guilds who would not benifit) would call for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unaele.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Naele</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 675<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/4/02 11:42:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3108.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is RF a camp or FFA!  Need some advice.</span><hr size=1> Thought you guys would find this interesting, someone posted it at EQclerics as what GM's use as a guide to deciding Ragefire disputes. also note that GM's have asked (and verant did say they were watching) that the quest be changed as it seems to be causing more trouble and not less as they had hoped. Hopefully they will get it through thier thick heads to make him a triggered spawn like the druid one....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1) This camp can be &quot;claimed.&quot; That is to say, one force given rights to first kill attempt and thereby, rights to the loot if successful. But it order for it to be claimed, the cleric must have a killing force present during the camp. If the force dwindles, the cleric will be given a brief period to replenish the force by whatever means within their sphere of influence. If the force cannot be replenished or the cleric leaves the zone for a reasonable amount of time, the claim is lost.<br>
<br>
2) A single cleric at the camp has no legitimate claim rights as described in #1.<br>
<br>
3) If multiple single clerics are contending for the camp and Ragefire spawns, whichever one who engages Ragefire with killing force first has rights to the kill. (This is effectively a race to get your people in the zone, to the spawn.)<br>
<br>
4) Kiting does not count as killing force engagement and thus gives no right to the kill.<br>
<br>
5) If one force fails* their attempt, they lose their claim and any killing force standing by is entitled to attempt the kill. If multiple killing forces are standing by, it would be FCFS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Those are the rules the GM's consider when making an arbitration about contention in this spawn. <br>
<br>
The Server GM said he and other server GM's are trying to get this quest changed yet again because of the contention problems. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Q) In GM # 5, if the first attempt fails, but no one else engages the mob while the first triggering group recovers, can the first group re-engage when ready or do they have to wait on anyone else who wants to take a turn before taking another shot?<br>
<br>
A.) If the first force is recooperated, ready, and able to kill and the second one is not completely or very nearly ready (like 5-10 mins from away from readiness) then yes, they may go again. If the second force is completely ready and able to kill (in which case they probably would have immediately engaged it upon the disengagement of the first force), then no, the first force must wait their turn (and they probably won't get one, but you never know).<br>
<br>
Q.) What is &quot;fail&quot;? Is it merely the reduction of your killing force to the point that the kill is not possibile (only feigners or offline rezzers left alive, no one dealing damage)? Does &quot;failure&quot; only come when the attackers cry &quot;Uncle&quot; and leave?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
A.) It would be the first case. Failure means the mob is disengaged. For example, if all that's left is feigners, camped out clerics, and a bard or druid kiting around Ragefire (remember kiting does not count as engagement) til the force can recoop, they have failed and their turn is over.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Need some advice.</span><hr size=1> For what it's worth here's my opinion on the whole thing, even though probably no one here knows me and doesn't really care I'm gonna go for it anyways so bare with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ....<br>
<br>
IMHO there are 2 ways we can solve this issue<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> .. come to an amicable agreement where everyone is happy<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> .. bug the hell out of Verant till the change the spawn time again and make Ragefire a triggered spawn similiar to the bard / rogue / monk / etc final fight<br>
<br>
Personally I'd go for option 1, though option 2 would make probably make more sense in the long run.  And here's my thoughts on how to deal with this in reverse order hehe, sorry just the way my mind is thinking today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Option 2 (the unlikely)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Say VI made a static &quot;Catalyst&quot; NPC spawn once every 3 days for 1 hour, if cleric_01 hands over an epic item the CatalystNPC_01 despawns and then sometime within the next say 10 hours RAGEFIRE will spawn.  If no one hands in the item CatalystNPC_01 then it despawns and appears again 3 days later, if cleric_01 hands over the item RAGEFIRE spawns whenever and is killed / despawns and the cycle begins again... much like the bard epic where something like 8 hours after Trak is killed CatalystNPC_01 spawns in Traks lair, an item is handed in and the NPC enrages then upon its death Trak spawns with the final bard epic item (or same with the monk epic in LOIO or whatever, I only know how a couple of epics work sorry hehe).<br>
<br>
If VI changed the spawn to something like that I would hope that it would improve things a whole bunch, but the chances of VI doing something to actually &quot;improve&quot; things for the player community is lets face it minimal on a good day hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Option 1 (the players choice)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - People are talking KS and FFA and rotation, lets face it gang this is an EPIC mob for one of the most highly prized epics in the game.. if we as a community don't come up with a viable solution things are gonna get very pissy indeed and no one will be happy.<br>
<br>
Ragefire seems (to me at least) to spawn every 5 - 6 days, so lets make it a rotation .. but here's the novel idea, lets not make it a rotation such as Trak or VS where it goes Guild_A, Guild_B, Guild_C, Guild_D, Guild_E and so on, lets make a rotation based on a single person CLERIC_01.  Ok now this might sound a little crazy but please bare with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  What say we take a list of all the clerics who are up to the RAGEFIRE part of their epic (I'm aware that may be a hell of a lot), then we arrange that list into an order for each cleric to have a shot at the spawn.  How to order that list I'm not sure, maybe could be done by guild and it's standing or the reputation of Cleric_01 within the EMarr community ... hell maybe even get a respected member(s) of EMarr (or perhaps a GM / guide if willing) to take the list and log in and do /random 1 101 (with appropriate number of witnesses) and organise the list like that.<br>
<br>
And here's the punch, why not have US as a community band together and help whichever cleric has their turn to take down RAGEFIRE and finish their epic.. i.e. we get a list of guilds and post with the rotation so when Rage spawns the call to arms can be sent out across the land to members of the available guilds and forces can mass to destroy the vile beast.  Cleric gets their epic, doesn't waste 6 days of their and their guilds life &quot;camping&quot; a spawn only to have Uberguild_01(tm) come in and KS or call FFA and attack it or whatever and other clerics are happy as it means there's not pissy fighting to get to the spawn in time and so forth.<br>
<br>
We're a community so lets start acting like one and help our fellow brothers and sisters dammit!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Providing the guild the cleric belongs to is willing to put out and have a group or 2 camped in the zone waiting for rage to pop on the 5 -6 days after previous kill then how long will it take get over there, buff up, organise groups and blow the big red Mofo the hell away huh??  I'd say from time of spawn to time of take down if everyone was willing to make the effort it'd take like 1 hour tops probably a lot less.<br>
<br>
Why help out a complete stranger??  Because we can.. hell do it for the warm fuzzy feeling inside when you realise you've just made someone the happiest they've ever been while playing EQ or because that person will remember the deeds of you / your guild and click you if they see your corpse I dunno /shrug, but I know I'd be willing to give up an hour or so of my time to go help if I'm online when it spawns.<br>
<br>
/shrug, flame away if you will.. those are just my personal views on the subject.<br>
<br>

Need some advice.</span><hr size=1> Glori, Affliction may be able to intimidate people into respecting the camp, but that doesn't solve the problem.  All you're doing is inviting people to dredge up past examples of how Affliction &quot;plays nice&quot; with other people.  Let's not go there.<br>
<br>
The idea of a rotation isn't going to go very far.  Aside from the fact that a lot of people are fed up with rotations, there are other problems.  Who would be in the rotation?  Are we giving rotation spots to big guilds, and then dumping all of the smaller guilds into a &quot;pickup slot&quot;?  Who decides?<br>
<br>
No one seems to be coming up with any concrete proposals, so I'll toss one out.  Feel free to rip up this proposal as much as you want.  It won't hurt my feelings.  I'd just like to see some movement toward a resolution.<br>
<br>
1. In order to be eligible for Ragefire, a cleric must be level 54 and must have completed the Ixiblat Fer/Overking portion of the epic quest.<br>
<br>
2. After each Ragefire spawn, the eligible clerics who wish to take the next Ragefire spawn identify themselves, and a numbered list is prepared.  Each cleric gets a number in the lottery.<br>
<br>
3. At a prearranged time and place (maybe in WC), a designated person randoms the numbers on the list.  The winning cleric is awarded the next Ragefire spawn.<br>
<br>
4. Camping Ragefire in Skyfire is unnecessary and gives no right to the spawn.  However, the cleric must kill Ragefire within 24 hours of the spawn, or it goes FFA.  This should allow clerics in all time zones to gather the forces necessary to make the kill.<br>
<br>
5. Each time a cleric loses in the lottery, the cleric gets an additional number in the next lottery.  For example, suppose that 25 clerics are in the first lottery.  Someone rolls /ran 1 25, and a winner is chosen.  If the 24 losers all enter the next lottery, they each get two numbers, so they are numbers 1 to 48.  New clerics would get a single number.  After two losses, a cleric would get three numbers, and so forth.  In other words, the longer you are in the lottery system, the greater your chance to win relative to new entries.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I'd probably get my epic sooner under an FFA system than under that system.  I'd be willing to live with this sort of system to eliminate all of the headaches and flames that would accompany an FFA system.  This would be a definite improvement over the idiotic current system. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

I think of this as very generous, actually.  That a person/guild who tries and fails gets an increased chance at going for it again.  I find it rather ingenious, both as an inspired system and the generosity that inspires such an idea (there is an inherent kindness in increasing the chance of letting someone turn their &quot;loss&quot; into a &quot;win&quot;).  Moreover, it encourages Feldynn's above-posted idea of everyone helping everyone else out.  Such an idea serves to remove the boundaries of guild, and allows the entire community to support a questing cleric in their pursuit.  I have not read anything about a large guild not being eligible to help a smaller guild in any of the proposal.  I really really like this.<br>
<br>
For that same reason, I'd be very surprised if this note was not pushed back by those who are larger and more powerful.  Pleasantly surprised, yes, but surprised nonetheless.<br>
<br>
In closing, Sagemon's proposal is the best idea I've seen.  Of course, that is from where I see things, your mileage may very.  Just my 2cp, take it or leave it.<br>

Need some advice.</span><hr size=1> I just saw this thread. Perhaps I should read this forum more often, but that would make me ill. One aspect of this thread troubles me, so please allow me to interrupt and state something:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Divine Grace respects all recognized camps, and will not knowingly Kill Steal anybody.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
That's it, thank you. I am not going out on a limb or speaking for people whom I should not be when I state this, I am simply reciting guild policy. As long as the server in general recognizes the SF Rage as a camp, DG respects it.<br>
<br>
Draelyn and Adarian are basically good people, believe it or not, if maybe a little excitable in debate. They can pontificate here if it entertains them, good for them. Heck, maybe even help form a new server policy on the mob, if they can tone it down some. But as they state plainly, they are not speaking for DG or relaying guild policy, but merely trying to add their thoughts to this debate. Just wanted to make that clear.<br>
<br>
Sorry to interrupt, you may now return to the flaming. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3108.topic&start=161&stop=163>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3108.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3108.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3108.topic&index=100><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3108.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3108.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
