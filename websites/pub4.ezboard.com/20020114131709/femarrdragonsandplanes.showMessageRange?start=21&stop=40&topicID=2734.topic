If you think about it and some of the posts here, yeah, you might say it sounds kind of like that situation without the mass murder.  Some of this guy's friends heard about him planning it and they didn't do anything about it, now this is what's become of things.<br>

Duec is responsible for his account, not some unknown or imaginary friend. If you give out your account info and they screw you then you shouldn't even bother taking the time to say not me. Giving account info to a known ninja looter/scammer was just asking for trouble or maybe hoping to profit some. <br>

In my honest opinion Im guessing Duec is a young kid (no offense) and he probably didnt realize what he was getting himself into.  <br>
<br>
Chances of him trying to do it again?  Who knows...<br>
<br>
Whether or not he'd have the guts to try it over I doubt he'll have much opportunity to.  Being able to raid with many people is going to be impossible for a while.  <br>
<br>
I have had people question where he got his amulet of necropotance (sp?) saying that he scammed that too.  So with both issues in mind I cant say that I would be able to trust him with anything in game.<br>
<br>
Duec will get nothing but shit when he is able to play again.  Or so it seems... and in a way I feel bad for the guy but in a way Im hoping he'll be taught a valuable lesson.<br>
<br>
I think his best move after the fact would have been a simple "Im sorry I fucked up" not a "my friend must have..." email.  A straight up apology without any reason would have had a much more positive effect on me.... and others I believe.<br>

What I find strange about this situation is simply that this seems like a complete turn-around from the person who everyone knew as Duec, previous to this incident. With the exception of a couple of people posting that he was a jerk  from the other threads on this matter, (and no one has said anything about him that pointed to him to be this shady, that I'm aware of) he seemed decent and a geniunely nice person. Most people have stood up for his character previous to this incident. To me this is very sad because someone who had a good reputation now has a terrible one and it does lead me to think that it may not have been him playing the character at the time. It does not mean I think him guiltless - don't get me wrong. He still has the responsibility to his in game friends and to himself to keep this person off his account. The explanation he gives the GM about handing the stuff back to everyone on the raid and being sorry leads me to think that it was really the 'good Duec' after all maybe being 'egged on' by someone else. Bottom line is there are too many questions and possibilities and you will never know the real story about this incident and while I can understand that you are torn and want to believe him based on past actions/dealings, you simply can't trust him. Would I ostrisize him? I don't think I'd have the heart for it (which is what I see you struggling with, I think.) I hope whatever you decide to do works out for you, sounds like a tough spot and one I am glad I don't have to deal with. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzelgreyweather.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zel Greyweather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/5/01 7:14:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The explanation...</span><hr size=1> /em hands Duec some color pencils to go along with his black and white pencil outline.<br>

I totally adored the guy prior to this... made an effort to have him at all of my raids, loved seeing him on other raids, he was a good guy imho.  I'd have backed him up on just about anything if this hadnt happened.  Seriously, it sucks to see someone like that be involved in a situation like this.  It truly saddens me.  If only I could have seen the look on my face when the GM said his name.  I was in total shock, denial mostly but damn... its screwed up.<br>
<br>
But sorry Duec... kinda looks like you need to change your password and work on getting that reputation back.  Stop sharing your account with your friends and you wont get fucked over.  Atleast you wont have to worry about blaming anyone else if it happens that way. <p>~Schmoopy~

<br>
The explanation I think we all agree is filled with inconsistencies and even if it wasn't, there are still some very serious issues of ethics involved.  No one is really thinking of coming to Duec's defense on the rightness of his actions (whatever they may have turned out to be).<br>
<br>
The question then, really, how do we progress from here?  I've already talked about the concerns for raid leaders and party members in the future on another thread...but EQ isn't just a game about killing stuff and getting fat loot.  You can do that in other games.  The reason to play EQ is to do it with other people.  EQ, in the end, is about frienships and associations.<br>
<br>
So how do we approach Duec in the future?<br>
<br>
The thing to remember, I think, is that no one can be everything to anyone.  I have a friend who I love dearly, that is a great guy and I would trust him with most things...until a person asks if she should go out with him.  I say emphatically no because he is a great guy--unless he's dating you in which case he is an asshole.  Does this mean he is a bad friend? No.  Would I go out with him?  HELL NO!<br>
<br>
We all have friends that have weaknesses...some we know cannot keep a secret, another cannot excercise tack to save their life, and a third is such a knee jerk arch-liberal that if you put her in a social situation with somone only middle of the road (heaven forbid conservative!) you are just going to have a big scene on your hands.<br>
<br>
Duec has done something either highly attrocious or at least very stupid.  Does this mean he deserves to be totally ostracized?  No--unless his actions violate your own personal sense of ethics to such a degree you no longer can interact with him.  Duec is the same person today as he was 3 weeks ago...you just know more about him now is all.  Assuming what you know now doesn't overwrite everything you feel about him, there is no reason why he can't continue as a friend.<br>
<br>
I'm not advocating forgive and forget...I think that would be very irresponsible.  I am merely asking that each of us remember that none of us is perfect and if Duec's imperfections aren't fatal to your friendship, then consider keeping him there.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I do not know Duec so this is not a decision I need make.  However, personally speaking, I would not tolerate a friend to lie to me to the degree Duec is (and my personal feeling is that he is lying and that he is the one who ninja looted--but that is my feeling and it has NOT been proven).  That action, NOT the ninja looting, is what would have doomed our friendship had it existed.<br>

I've been playing this game since it has been out and have played on fennin ro, druzzil ro, and erollisi.  All characters were 47+ so i'm very experianced in the game.  Does anyone remember back in the day when loot was looted and you didnt have a clue what was looted?  For instance, sittin in magi room in Lguk when there were only about 3 SMR's on the whole server and a magi spawns and then is looted.  The person who looted it said, bah, legs again, but then the very next day people saw him in an SMR.  How do we go about Ninja Looters??  In this situation, people were very pissed b/c it was so rare and took a good group at the time.  Sound like the same situation?  What did i do?  How did it affect me?    In my opinion, eq was made for fun and i think people look beyond this (look at all the rants and flames)   The ninja looter had a horrible name for awhile but it died off b/c he admitted he was wrong and showed he could carry himself at a higher level.  Of course i grouped with him again, i even let him loot bodies.  The real question is, who are the loot happy fools?  I could give a crap what i get and what i don't get, just give it time and you will have your loot.  I play this game for the fun of it, not the stress and all the shots given in these posts.  I've been on numerous vox/naggey/blah blah and the list goes on, i've never once went into the raid and said this is my raid and i'm going to get some phat loot.  Loot is always nice but isnt the defeat even more precious then the loot?  To me, killing somethingwith friends is more precious than the loot given.  what do you remember of good raids? loot or the assemblance/strategy/patience and overall working together? I'd have to ignore loot in this case.  Of course getting back to the topic, Duec was wrong (if it was the real Duec).  This cannot be confirmed that it was him and probably never will.   EQ may be a game but i think many people take it as their life.  so people in this case, consider this, i'm sure you've had a friend backstab you or lie to you or maybe even stole from you.  What do you do?  A friend is a friend in my mind, of course he made a stupid decision but years of friendship takes priority as does it in this case.  the people who new duec give him another shot.  I'm sure he learned his lesson, just look at all these posts about his character!!!  i'm not saying what he did or didnt do is right but i think we get off the issue, this is a game, things happen and then life goes on.   I feel sorry for duec in the fact he may have made a stupid error or the fact he has been spammed about over 50+ posts.  Maybe duec took this game as his life and now is depressed to the point he doesnt want to hear anymore babble about this and maybe thats why he's not posting, i can't blame him.  What the heck is he suppose to say? people ask him to apologize and what does he do? he apologizes, then he gets tell of being a liar a card and so on.  i'm not on his side but jesus, leave it alone.  i'm posting this b/c i've seen this happen before, not saying where and when but it has happened before and i was along on the raid.  What happened? culprit was never caught but damn, i got some killer screenshots and had a blast and no i wasnt the culprit.  I just think people go to the extremes for loot when they should just be having fun.  And to many people EQ&gt;real life.  For these people, sit down, have a beer or two and really think aboutwhat you post and who you criticize before you post.  I won't come back to this forum for the simple fact, i'm sure people have nothing esle to do then post bs about this post and i don't really care.  Hope this helps and is the last post about Duec.<br>
