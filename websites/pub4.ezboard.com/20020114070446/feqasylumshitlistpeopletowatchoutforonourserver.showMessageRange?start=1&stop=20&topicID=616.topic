<br>
This time I took it to heart..He done this to my Real Life husband..I have never had to shit list anyone EVER!! For the ones of you who know me I am a very patient and kind person but you mess with my family and I become very pissed!!<br>
<br>
The events occur like this..my husband over EQ sends me a tell and proceeds to ask me about the barracuda in LOIO which one will spawn the corrupted..so I tell him there is only one that will spawn it and give him the location. I have done this myself for I have a 53 druid with just Faydwer left to go.<br>
<br>
Well a couple of hours go by and I hear yelling from the other computer..<br>
<br>
Seems that Ghon had been stalking around Shurakair(my husband) Shurakiar had gotten the tainted to spawn and KILLED it..we have SS of it..so the corrupted spawns and Shurakiar proceeds to take it down..well when Ghon jumps in a starts to go nuke happy Shurakair asks for him to back off that it is his mob.<br>
<br>
Well Ghon gets the kill of the corrupted and proceeds to loot. Well Ghon I'm glad that you feel proud of yourself!! You did it again and got your name on this shit list..WAY TO GO You selfish ass druid...you give us a VERY bad name..<br>
<br>
And let me be the first to say this you spineless person..HOW DO YOU THINK YOU GOT THE CORRUPTED?? You can only kill the tainted to make the corrupted spawn..and I'm 100% damn sure that you did not do that!! I seen on my husband screen that the exp went to him and hell yes he did engage first even on the corrupted!! <br>
<br>
So if you have even half a heart contact a GM and have the item that you looted WRONGFULLY returned to it rightful owner which is Shurakair..<br>
<br>
Also..the comment about you helping him get another corrupted to spawn because you felt bad that he didn't get the kill..let me tell you something..I'll be damned if that will happen!! I will put in all my hours of playing EQ and camp that thing for DAYS apon DAYS before scum as yourself help my husband get a epic piece!!<br>
<br>
I'm sure that Shurakair will also post on here and many will tell you that he is not a liar nor will ever be..<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to have to do this and hopefully it will be my last post on this board..but something has to be done about this guy..<br>
<br>
Sorry edited because I was so pissed I forgot to put my name..hehe<br>

<br>
I decided to camp the Corrupted Barracuda in LOIO for the druid epic.  Most druids know that the tainted will only spawn in one spot.  I was camping that spot LONG before Ghon entered the zone.  After I had been camping the Tainted for about an hour, Ghon comes in and proceeds to kill every Barracuda he can find.  I continue camping my one spawn.<br>
<br>
Eventually the Tainted spawns for me (at the spot I had been camping).  I pulled it onto the shore and proceeded to Root/DoT it so I could med up for the Corrupted.<br>
<br>
I knew Ghon was in the area, I have dealt with him before and I knew he was not to be trusted.  Rather than wait for him to see it on tracking, I told him I had it, and to please leave it alone.  He responded with &quot;I've been trying to get that to spawn - go away&quot;.<br>
<br>
He eventually finds me, and sits near the Tainted, waiting for it to die.  I took my time killing the Tainted, TRYING to contact someone from his guild or a GM.  Meanwhile I'm sending him tells to back away.  He never responds.  He just sits nearby, waiting for the mob to drop.<br>
<br>
As soon as the Tainted died, the Corrupted spawned and I ran up and attacked it, thinking that would give me rights to the mob.  Well Ghon didn't think so.  He proceeded to nuke like there was no tomorrow.  In the end, he did more damage than I and got the kill.<br>
<br>
So, the facts are:<br>
1.  I made the Tainted spawn.<br>
2.  I killed the Tainted, hence spawning the Corrupted<br>
3.  I engaged the Corrupted first.<br>
4.  Ghon got the kill for the Corrupted.<br>
<br>
This is one guy that belongs here, and should be shunned at all costs.  I am currently working with the leaders of his guild to resolve the problem.  However, given the nature of this, I still felt HE needed to be recognized here again regardless of what his guild decides.  From what I can gather he has told his guild leaders, he is straight faced lying to them, banking on the &quot;his word against mine&quot; bit.<br>
<br>
I didn't have logging turned on until well after the incident, but here is a snip of what I did manage to log from a conversastion with him.<br>
<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:34:53 2001] You told Ghon, 'What's even sadder is that you have these nice people defending a KSing liar.  8('<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:35:09 2001] Ghon tells you, 'no, i felt kinda bad that you after it too - but that does not mean ill let you take it from me'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:35:38 2001] Ghon tells you, 'i killed over 50 baracudas and did not see you one time /shrug'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:35:57 2001] Ghon tells you, 'and you telling..'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:36:09 2001] Ghon tells you, 'me to 'stay off your mob sure as heck does not make it your mob'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:36:14 2001] You told Ghon, 'Yea, and you were killing the wrong ones.  Why did you enage the corrupted after I engaged it??'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:36:27 2001] You told Ghon, 'But I hit it first...  that does make it my mob.'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:36:35 2001] You told Ghon, 'And killing the tainted also make it my mob.'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:36:51 2001] Ghon tells you, 'if you are being honest and were indeed killing there for 2 hours then perhaps (maybe) i was wrong'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:37:04 2001] Ghon tells you, 'but i was also there for over an hour'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:37:30 2001] You told Ghon, 'Yes, I had been there.  And you were killing the wrong ones.  But the fact that I made him spawn, I killed the tainted, and then YOU killed the corrupted means you BLATENTLY KS'd me.'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:37:40 2001] Ghon tells you, 'lol, just hitting the mob that i pop'd does not make it your mob, fella'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:37:52 2001] Ghon tells you, 'blah'<br>
[Sun Jul 29 16:37:56 2001] Ghon tells you, 'puttin you on ignor'<br>
<br>
(I took out a conversation I was having with his guild leaders and the /ooc junk at the time)<br>
<br>
If nothing else, this shows that he has no idea what the rules are, or he doesn't feel that they apply to him.  Anyway, thats pretty much it.  Thanks for listening (eeer reading)<br>

<br>
however that said once again I know nothing about this spawn but from what i was told last night <br>
<br>
1.) only one of these Barracuda will spawn the corrupted????<br>
2.) there is more then one Barracuda???<br>
<br>
<br>
from the small chat log that was posted here.<br>
<br>
1.) Shurakair had the correct spawn<br>
2.) ghon was killing other barracuda's <br>
<br>
now from this chat log it does look like a case of someone that doesn't know enough about their epic (ghon) if he was busy killing the wrong barracuda's in hopes the corrupted spawned, could it be possible that he really did think that BAM he spawned it from all his killing??<br>
<br>
<br>
now the above is just my thoughts based ONLY on the chat log i have seen here...in no way am i saying that's what happened or that ghon didn't KS (that will be reviewed when i get the chatlogs/SS in my email).<br>

<br>
Only one deepwater baracuda will spawn tainted fishies.  It is a statis spawn on a 6 min timer.  I had thought every druid working on this knows it, but I guess not everyone does.  I have killed 11 tainted so far but no corrupted fishy for me.  They must just hate me or something. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
It suppose to be random if you get the tainted (blue tinted according to guides on the net) that will spawn a corrupted fishy.  I had heard 1 out of 3 will be the right one, but after 11 tainted I can say those odds are not right. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
The only way to get the tainted is to kill this one static ph deepwater baracuda.  Nothing else will trigger a tainted.  And the only way to get a corrupted is to kill the correct tainted.  If it is the correct tainted like all the other corrputed mobs other than Fay, the corrupted mob spawns as soon as you kill the tainted at the tainted's corpse.<br>
<br>
So this is a camp of a static spawn ph or tainted.  Let me repeat it is a static spawn that pops the tainted fishy and killing no other mob will spawn it.<br>
<br>
I will go there every so often and check the spawn location.  If someone is there, will ask them to let me know when they are done.  If noone there and ph is up I shout for a camp check and if noone responds to the druid epic fish then I call it. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

Just to clarify a couple things that is common knowledge to most druids who are working on their epic.<br>
<br>
1.  The lake contains about 10 Barracuda spawns<br>
2.  Only one particular spawn location will spawn a Tainted Barracuda.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I do believe Ghon believed that he spawned the Tainted.  He had been killing Barracudas for a little while.  (More like 15-30 mins).  The fact remains that I was camping the correct spawn and I did get the tainted to spawn.<br>
<br>
Ghons crime is not being ignorant as to how to spawn the Corrupted.  His crime is a blatant, unremorseful kill stealing.  Lets pretend for a moment that there was any doubt in Ghons mind as to who SPAWNED the Tainted.  Two people were camping the same mob.  I engaged the Tainted first, the Tainted was half dead BEFORE Ghon even found it.  That alone means the the spawn was mine.<br>
<br>
Lets also pretend that killing the Tainted doesn't count as ownership of the Corrupted.  The fact that I did engage the Corrupted first does give me rights to that mob.  Ghon disregarded this and stole the kill anyway.<br>
<br>
Simc, just to let you know, the screenshots are in a zip file that is almost 2MB in size.  If you just want the chat screens I can cut them out and just send those to make the file smaller.  Let me know when you have cleaned out enough of your inbox to send you those.  I'm at work all day today, and will send them tonight if you let me know it's okay.  Thanks<br>

also if those logs do in fact show that when ghon engaged the mob it was already engaged by yourself then once again that is KS'ing and will be dealt with as such. <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">

Bascally what he said is I don't know Ghon personally, and I don't know if all the facts are true, but if I meet him I will have no respect for him.<br>
<br>
Well Shur sent me some chat logs of what happened, and I think I can pretty much peice together exactly what happened by the &quot;testimonials&quot; and the chat logs.<br>
<br>
It seems Shur and Ghon were BOTH camping the spot where this epic mob spawns, together, at the same time for quite a while.  Ghon thought he had to run around and kill every barracuda he could see to make it pop, while Shur had the more detailed information of the barracuda's exact spawn point.<br>
<br>
The Tainted Barracuda spawns, and Ghon comes over to finish it off, and Shur is allready at the right loc.<br>
<br>
Both Ghon and Shur basically say, back off, I was camping here, this is mine.  Ghon thinks he is right because he had been killing the barracudas trying to make the tainted to spawn, and Shur thinks he was right because he was sitting at the /loc and killing the PH.  There really isn't much time to discuss the matter and before you know it Ghon out-nukes and gets the exp kill for the Corrupted barracuda.<br>
<br>
Both druids think they had the camp, both druids think that one tried to KS the other.  <br>
<br>
I'm dissappointed at Ghon for not seeing who was at the camp and trying to talk about the camp BEFORE anything spawned.  I'm disappointed at Ghon for shooting first and asking questions later.  And I'm disappointed at Ghon for not being more diplomatic about the situation.<br>
<br>
I don't think that he knowingly &quot;kill stealed&quot; the corrupted barracuda though.  In his mind, he was killing the PHs, he was doing all the work, and he made the tainted pop.  Of course he was wrong :P and he owes you a big fat apology.<br>

I'll be the first to admit, the text in the logs does not show everything that happened.  However, your analysis of the situation is wrong in a couple places.  You do not get a picture of exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
Ghon was NOT camping the spot where the corrupted spawns.  He was camping any fish that moved.  He was no where near me or the Tainted when is spawned.  He had no idea the Tainted was even up until I told him.  By that time it was past 50% dead.<br>
<br>
I told him that I had it in HOPES that he would be honorable enough to stay away and let me kill MY mob in peace.  I eventually pulled the tainted to the shore.  By this time he has me or the fish on track and shows up.  He did NOT once cast a nuke or DoT on the tainted because he KNEW I already had it past 50%.<br>
<br>
There was a good 3 or 4 mins between when I told him I had the Tainted until the tainted died.  How could there be ANY confusion what so ever as to who's mob it belonged to?<br>
<br>
While the Tainted was dying, Ghon sat there and patiently waits for me to finish the Tainted off, PLANNING on nuking as fast as possible when the Corrupted spawns.  And thats EXACTLY what he did.  As soon as the Tainted died, the Corrupted mob spawned in his place and I attack it immedately.  I even provided a screenshot of the moment where I got the EXP for the Tainted and attacked IMMEDATELY after the Corrupted spawns.<br>
<br>
At this point Ghon opened fire.  I would call that premeditated Kill Stealing.<br>
<br>
I honestly believed this was the type of response I would get, given how boldy Ghon has lied about it.  I'm sorry his guild leaders cannot see what a liar he is.  Thank you for taking the time to look at what information I could provide, however your &quot;conclusion&quot; is TOTALLY wrong and I am not satisfied at all.  /shrug  So be it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, he KNOWINGLY, and BLATENTLY Kill Stole an Epic mob.<br>
<br>
Lets think about my motives for a moment....<br>
What EXACTLY do I have to gain from this?  Absolutely NOTHING.  I'm trying to save his GUILD from the embarrasment of having a bold faced kill stealer.  I'm also trying to inform the rest of Lanys that this piece of shit cannot be trusted under ANY circumstances.  I know there is nothing anyone can do to return what was stolen (since the Corrupted drop is NO DROP).<br>
<br>
The fact that you admitted he was wrong is a BIG step in the right direction.  Given that it now sounds like a &quot;my word against his&quot; situation, I beg you to talk to ANYONE in the game that even remotely knows me.  If there is one thing I'm not, it's a liar.  All you need to do is look here for a little history on Ghon.  I WAS there when he was training people in CS.  I talked with him in OOC during that episode.  Perhaps he felt he needed retribution for my words against him and this is how he chose to take it.  I don't know.<br>
<br>
To anyone NOT in Ghon's guild, STAY AWAY FROM GHON!  He WILL Kill Steal ANY mob he feels he has a right to, reguardless of any rules.<br>
<br>
BTW Miramicha, EVERY word of what I have said is 100% the truth.  So no, you did NOT jump to any conclusions about this.  Ghon is THE worst person I have ever personally encountered on Lanys.  (Never met Binidin or Lumiwhatever).  Ghon belongs with those 2.<br>
<br>
To Errtai and Simc, I'm saddened that you allow such a worthless individual to remain in your guild.  If that's the caliber of player you want, you can have them all.  At least I'll know who to stay away from in the future.<br>

<br>
the following is what i told you and will repeat once again:<br>
<br>
1.) send me the screenshots and chat logs and i would look into them<br>
<br>
2.) the screenshots you sent where peices of converstations you had with ghon and showing you killing the one mob.no where does it show ghon being rude telling you to fuck off i don't give a shit if you where camping this i'm going to take it anyways  in fact your screenshots show ghon saying he thought the spawn was his..not that he was just going to push his way in but HE THOUGHT IT WAS HIS<br>
<br>
3.) i explained unless i had something SOLID where i could see one way or the other a CLEAR CASE OF KS'ing .  what did you want me to do??<br>
<br>
your screenshots do show you getting one kill and ghon getting another..however your screenshots ALSO clearly show ghon saying that he thought he was the one killing the spawn that made that stuff pop...do you EVEN for a sec think maybe he thougth you were KS'ing him?<br>
<br>
<br>
what i don't understand is when people bring something like this to me and say oh well sorry i didn't turn on my chatlog or i didn't get screenshots but i want you to believe me cause i'm not a liar ..that could very well be true infact i'm sure it is i have no reason to believe you are a liar... however once again from your SS it shows ghon clearly saying he thought HE WAS CAMPING THAT SPAWN NOT YOU.<br>
<br>
now ghon and his shitlist ..i will not defend him on that..except to say i did post there saying any OTHER conflicts with ghon to please contact a member of ROA regarding it and would be delt with (we did not deal with the other stuff as he had just joined our guild and didn't have enough experiance with him to make judgement either way)and NO other complaint until now...<br>
<br>
Yes i do believe in fact there is NO question in my mind that the spawn was YOURS...however without PROOF that ghon KS&quot;D on purpose i can't take your word over his...it would be no different than saying i'm taking his word over yours because that IS NOT THE CASE ..as errtai has stated we BOTH believe you are in the right and he is in the wrong and will be spoken to about it...but to ask me to boot him without something more then what you have given is asking to much.<br>
<br>
<br>
i would also like to once again state (as i did before to you) ghon has NEVER displayed this side to ROA infact he has never been anything but helpful...a little mouthy at times (but i'm sure every guild has mouthy people in them).<br>
<br>
anyways i'm sure everyone and their dog will jump all over me for this cause we all would rather believe he's a piece of shit (because of his other run-ins) and maybe he does deserve this title but in this CASE i do beleive ghon really did think he was the one camping stuff and you ks'd him (that is the story we got from him)<br>
