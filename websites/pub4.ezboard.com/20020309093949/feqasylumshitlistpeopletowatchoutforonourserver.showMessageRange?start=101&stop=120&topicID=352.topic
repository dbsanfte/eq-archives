Then he did &quot;threaten&quot; but he didnt do. Why do you think he would Threaten? Um beacuse peope were probly giving him Shizz. Im not sayin they did or didnt. Just saying if they were,he probly got mad. bout it. And besides i was in the zone. the GM was there. Observing. If he did train or whatever GM woulda handled it. But no bad went down.

I did not post cicely on the shitlist because I didn't feel she should of posted anything about this up here since it was between me and HER not morons like you adjani.<br>
Trak I know you, you know me But what you said didn't relate to the issue at all. My brother did not comit a crime in fact the only thing he did was assert his stubborness with ill manners. The only way to get out of being associated with it is if i would of said IM NOT HIS BROTHER, which would not be true because I am, and I'm Not about to dissasociate myself with my family over a fucking game. Would you? All those that make Sensible posts i will listen but those that made Ignorant posts or not thought out posts For example Adjani, Well Let them live the way they do. Now, Am &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; responsible for my brother apoligizing simply because I am his brother, hell no.<br>
Do I deserve to lose respect simply because he is my brother, I expect my friends to stick by me and my family to stick by me, except in dire circumstances of reason.<br>
The only thing That I have posted on this board that is possibly wrong is that everyone 50+ has begged, I know me and a dozen of my Rl friends all used to and I also Realize that if I was shitlisted way back then That I most likely Woundn't be referred to as Ulti, but as something else. I don't beg anymore, I Ignore other beggers. I DO have the right to post my opinion up here. Adjani Obviously thinks that's a priveledge and not a right and they I don't deserve it. I Am One of the only ones I know On everquest that treats this GAME as it is. I don't care whether or not people think my character or my ways of doing things is wrong, I'm willing to help others out most the time. I Speak my opinion, I speak up for my friends, and I speak up against things that are wrong im not afraid of other's judgement. This game is not life people like adjani need to remember that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujitsafoju.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jitsa FoJu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/19/01 12:50:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BINIDIN  (10th Level Half Elf Warrior/BEGGER) :(</span><hr size=1> Befor this gets all out of hand i would like to say something.

<br>
ultimikik sends out a long worded response to my post regarding the nagafen raid.  in it ultimikik states the following-<br>
<br>
<br>
I wasn't happy on that raid at all because 1) I get stuck in small group..which was fixed by the end. 2) You never thanked me for helping you, which I was trying to do since the beginning 3) I won no loots, (no biggie)<br>
<br>
if you don't mind, i wish to clarify this... you were not happy at all on the nagafen raid because<br>
<br>
1. you got stuck in a small group?  when you do not have enough people to form full six man groups, one or some groups are going to be shorted.  it is really a simple mathematical possibility.  you are a wizard.  wizards and necros and magicians on nagafen raids *heck, most raids for that matter* generally tend to be on one of the last groups announced, with a shaman or druid as their healer.  the reason being is that once you reach a high lvl as yourself, you know how to play your class appropriately.  part of that knowledge is when to cast a spell so as to not draw aggro to yourself.  if you were casting spells early, drawing aggro early, and making your druid/shaman healer have to constantly stress out by healing you, then you need to rethink how you play the wizard class.  or is it that you are not pleased that you were placed in the &quot;small&quot; group cause you wanted xp, and you knew that the group that you were in would not get xp regardless of the amount of spells that you casted?  if that is the case, then it is apparent to me that you do not understand the true meaning of a raid- it is NOT to get xp, but it is to accomplish a goal as part of a team.  again the above two statements (casting early, not getting xp) is merely an assumption, not fact.<br>
<br>
2. i never thanked you for helping me.  you helped port a couple of the raid members to nektulos to get them close to sol b.  you also informed me of quite a few people from the original raid party who wished to go.  i believe if i recall that you also informed me of possibly two, three more raid members of needed classes who wished to go.  if you had not done that, i would imagine myself or someone else could have done the same.  however, the fact remains that you did help out.  and if i did not thank you, then i am sorry.  a lot was going on that night, and leading a very impromptu nagafen raid is a tough task for anyone to do, especially an OPEN impromptu nagafen raid.  you should try it sometime and see how hard it really is.  i state this cause during the setup up and gathering process, i am trying to balance a dozen conversations in addition to continuing to find raid members.  sometimes you tend to forget to say thanks, but you hope that people understand the predicament you are in.<br>
<br>
3. you did not win loot.  this is the funniest of them all.  i cannot speak for anyone else on this server, but personally i have been on many many many raids where i have won nothing.  does this mean i had a bad time?  NO!!!  because i saw others win something, and others improved themselves with loot, and i was part of a team that accomplished a goal.  you not being happy cause you did not win loot comes across to myself as an extremely selfish individual who only cares about himself, not others.  and if this person goes on a raid or does an xp group and does not win phat l00t, and is unhappy about it?  then this is a person i choose to not want to associate with, simple as that cause they seem to me only caring about one thing- personal gain and profit from items.<br>
<br>
the original reason why i made my post was two fold.  first, ultimikik in an earlier post defends binidin. he states the following- <br>
<br>
DELETE THIS IDIOTIC POST PLEASE!<br>
..simply statede 90% of people that are now 50+ begged as a newbie. it's something character's just get rid of as they grow older in levels and experience. NOT SHITLIST MATERIAL.<br>
I begged as a newbie. i used to stake out banks and ask for 20pp to every person. i made ALOT of money. <br>
<br>
this above paragraph shows me that ultimikik feels that the majority of the server begged as a newbie.  he also goes on to mention that he in fact did beg as a n00b, he staked out banks, he asked 20pp from every person.  in doing so, he made quite a bit of money.<br>
<br>
in that case, ultimikik acknowledges that he is a beggar.  i hate beggars.  i hate them with a passion.  i have no respect for anyone who feels that begging for items and help gets you somewhere.  as a player who has close to 100 days played on her main character, i have worked damn hard to get my lvl, equipment, personality, relationships, guild officer status, friendships, respect for and from others, etc etc etc.  if ultimikik wants to choose the easy way out, that is his perrogative.  however, those who choose the easy way out and beg i have no tolerance for, and i do indeed find their character lacking.<br>
<br>
second, ultimikik allowed his young brother participation on the nagafen raid.  as the raid leader, amalaya was never informed of such a request.  ultimikik went over the raid leader's authority to do as he saw fit.  i know of quite a few raid leaders who not only would have booted jista out of the raid immediately once they knew what was going on, they would have booted you as well for having the gall to do such a thing.  you chose to have him accompany the raid.  doing so means that you are now responsible for his actions and his comments.  i am responsible for the people that i invite to my raid.  it is my duty as their raid leader to provide for them a memorable gaming experience, and to accomplish something together as a team.  you bring an outsider, you deal with him.  you failed to handle your &quot;late addition&quot; in a respectful and dignified manner.  his conduct was not becoming of someone who i give a lot of respect for.  it got to the point where i translocated him out because he not only harassed me in /tell about wanting to roll on nagafen loot as a lvl 25 monk, but also threatened to ruin the raid party as a whole.  granted a lvl 25 monk cannot do much before he/she dies, but that is regardless of the point.  you send me a tell stating that you are going to ruin my raid, you are gone.  and then he petitioned and got back into the zone with us.  i am going to assume that you knew he got translocated.  i am also going to assume that you knew that he came back via a /petition.  and yet you did nothing about it.  the raid leader made a decision affecting your friend, and you neither agreed nor disagreed.  since you brought him onto the raid as an extra, and he is your responsibility, i find that appalling.  i also find that lacking in character.<br>
<br>
so go ahead ultimikik.  go ahead jista.  shit list cicely and amalaya.  shit list her for not allowing a lvl 25 monk to roll on nagafen loot.  shit list her for translocating a lvl 25 monk back to his bind spot after threats of training the raid party, and ruining the raid.  shit list her for having to /petition a gm to the raid to ensure that her raid went as smoothly as it possibly could, given the circumstances provided.  i have never been on the honor list, i have never been on the shit list.  it would be nice to make one of them... honor list i would be honored by, a shit list post by you i would merely chuckle.<br>
<br>
and yes, i find both ultimikik and jista to be of extremely lacking in character... sorry.<br>

You Just failed to answer any of my questions at all, and made up a bunch of stuff.<br>
to 1) it's easy to adress, I was complaining about a small group simply because Ifelt that you thought I wasn't part of the raid at all By not thanking me once that night when Ihelped you MUCH more then you said up there I Thought this was going to be cool helping someone who knew how to raid and being in a group with a role or something to help you out. Had Nothing to do with a cleric or not getting the appropriate heals, Had NOTHING to do with not getting experience, Your assumptions are DEAD WRONG.<br>
For #2 Another quite easy one Like I said above I felt as if you left me out of the raid entirely, I had thought i was going to get a chance at Helping co-host the raid, It was obviosly a misunderstanding so Instead I tried helping you out with as much of other things as possible. Picking up people , Finding people, /telling you who was in who's group every now and then and telling you which group lacked what. Having my little brother do a CR, Which now IDefinatly regret I should of pulled my corpse out and Left.<br>
3) Notice the (no biggie) Not getting loot is always a disapointer, But As i said it was NO BIGGIE. The fact that i posted bout 90% of people begging is from my experience and my opinion. I know just about all my friends have.<br>
The part that mde me laugh the most although was when you said that I allowed my brother to follow on the nagafen raid. Like i said Before, I am NOT his parent I am his brother You need to learn the difference between the two of them. I let my brother do as he pleases advising and guiding him, I don't harass him or knock his ass clear to the ground when he does something I feel is wrong. I can't see one reason why you Got so mad at me above in my post. Anything Sensible for that matter. You seemed to assume that i told my brother to follow us when in reality i Advised him on the opposite. You are wrong in discriminating me in this way. This is why your character lacks. I apoligize to those who had to read all this but When I attempted to talk to cicely in game she Ignored me and eventually told me To use the boards ( not exact words) but mainly she woulnd't respond and said she said everything that she needed to and that i can respond on the boards.<br>
I'm tired, And going to sleep. Good Night. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uultimikik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ultimikik</A> at: 3/19/01 8:18:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucicelygoldenfair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cicely goldenfair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lanys Cheerleader</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/19/01 7:44:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BINIDIN  (10th Level Half Elf Warrior/BEGGER) :(</span><hr size=1> not even going to bother to respond.<br>

What can I say? I didn't know better. My friends did it, the EQ community didn't seem to mind so I didn't learn right away. I grew out of it and eventually found other ways to make money.<br>
<br>
Cicely, how can you judge Ultimikik by the actions of his brother? I wasn't there so I'll just use the info I was given...<br>
<br>
Jitsa helped with the CR and then asked to be able to roll on Naggy loot. After he asks, you start /ooc'ing and humiliating him. All you had to do was say no... I don't know anything about it so I won't share my thoughts.<br>
<br>
Maybe you two (Cicely and Ultimikik) should take your arguments to Email...<br>

<br>
secondly, this thread has bigtime degenerated, and has very little to do with the original intent.<br>
<br>
based on such a tenuous position, i'm inclined to lock n' delete.. any one have a major objection?<br>
