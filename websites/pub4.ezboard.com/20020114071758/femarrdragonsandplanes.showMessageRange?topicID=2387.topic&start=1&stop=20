Quote:<br>
<br>
"Hello all, this is qundi. This night in a group, i answered a question about where i lived. Which FYI is in the US but i am Persian. The group then gave over 2 dozen remarks about how horrible i was and how i would burn in hell, etc etc. I petitioned them, naturally, for threatening me and insulting me. When the GM came he said "i see nothing wrong in their words as they all accurately describe you" so that was fine, i wasnt going to fight it. Then this GM started questioning me on everything. He claimed that i was lieing on my heritage to "receive gain" but no gain would have been received. So then he said "i doubt that you even bought this game since there arent computer stores in Afganistan" (which is a huge lie, even though i did buy it in the US) and he asked for my account key found on my original everquest cd. Since i bought that 2 years ago i could not find it. He then told me i could tell him i was not from afganistan and receive a 30 day suspension, or continue with my "lie" and have my account banned. <br>
I refused to put a game over my morals, even if it is just a little lie to someone i dont know. I told him as i had before "i refuse to lower myself down and deny my heritage, even if being from Afganistan does ban me from playing this game" and so i was logged out by him and my account was deleted"<br>
<br>
The GM was Kaikachi.<br>

If your friend can prove it to VI itself , I recommend she takes contact with them and explain the whole story.<br>
They will have the log for sure for 3 weeks.<br>
<br>
In my opinion there should be no banning over heritage , religion , or whatever a country did in this case.<br>
Because of some people's actions ,not everyone should pay for that...<br>

i think anyone who read about pearl harbor knew this was gonna happen, back then the US gathered up all japanese-americans and put them into prison camps, hopefully we won't go this far now, but if that is what is nessecary to prevent more acts like this from happening then so be it.<br>

I will merely add that although my legal assistant has strongly urged me to take legal action (verant has violated law on 3 counts, privacy, violation of contract, and racism) I do not wish any gain from informing you, verant, and the million other message boards my friends guild etc told me to write at. I merely am responding to a national and perhaps worldwide counter terrorism.

We are not all sadistic or chaotic. I am living in the states and have been most of my life. I used to believe America as home of the free, where all were accepted for who they were. Now i see mosks being vandalized (although im Christian this still disturbs me) i hear of fellow arabs being beaten at their schools, and it wholely sickens me. I fear to even leave my own house in these troubled days, so know i have more anger towards these terrorists then you can imagine.<br>

As Chuck mentioned, even though Farsi is spoken in Afghanistan--and Farsi being the language spoken by Persians--I have never heard a person from Afghanistan refer to themselves as Persian. Afghanistani would be the word. I believe &quot;Pakistani&quot; was the word the poster above looked for---although that word of course describes someone from Pakistan and not Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the sequence of events does not reflect GM behaviour. &quot;Deleting an account&quot; is not something a GM can do on his/her own, unless they'd happen to be a Lead GM...and even then people get banned. Not deleted.<br>
<br>
Not a very believable account overall.<br>

I do believe you should at least pursue the problem with the GM, as no one should do what this GM did.  It was racist.  Though I wish it were different, of course there are going to be reprisals of some kind against innocent people of Middle Eastern &quot;looking&quot; heritage.  We are kidding ourselves if we think that the truly stupid, ignorant, racist people wil overlook such an opportunity to put down their fellow man.  There will most likely also be bereaved loved ones who become angry and decide to take it out on any &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; they see.  Though many of us do not agree and hope that there will be no open violence toward those of Middle Eastern heritage, please realize that the actions of a few or even a hundred are not the view of the whole.  <br>
<br>
Think of it this way, black and white cannot even live in harmony in this country and we have been living here together for a couple hundred years as supposed equals. (I say supposed as we all know the pain we have endured in attempting to establish equality).<br>
<br>
Tell me this, do you have a log of this conversation? Although to prove anything you must have screenshots.. I was told this back when someone was harrassing me online and using different names all the time.<br>

We don't have all the facts at hand. Perhaps what the people<br>
in the group said wasn't as bad as they thought and the GM <br>
didn't agree. Maybe this person got upset about the GM not<br>
seeing thier side of it and said something stupid. Perhaps <br>
there were already other warnings on this persons account<br>
and mouthing off to the gm when the gm didn't agree with <br>
them was enough to be a final warning....<br>

If you don't know the infrastructure of Sony's CS, I'm not going to lay it out for you.<br>
<br>
But no Server GM deletes accounts.<br>
<br>
And exactly what Chuck said---Persians are Iranian.<br>
<br>
Aren't there upsetting things already happening?? Do we need to invent and fabricate more? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 472<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/14/01 8:25:03 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am extremely pissed off.</span><hr size=1> Susp.....whatever happened to giving a person the benefit of the doubt?

There's no excuse for racism - but to anyone getting there knickers in a twist without more info than this - remember 'Daglett'?<br>

I would like to see a log posted along with some screenshots to really believe this.  However it still is wrong, and part of me thinks that it could be true.  This is only because I haven't heard many good things about the GM <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
Some questions that Chuk asked that I really think need to be answered:<br>
<br>
Whom were the members in your group?<br>
What was being said to you exactly that prompted you to petition?<br>
What were the names of the people threatening and insulting you?<br>
What were Haikachi's exact words to you?<br>
What did you say to Haikachi EXACTLY to get the responses he made?<br>
<br>
And the most important question I would like to see answered:<br>
<br>
Why are you telling groupmates your ethnic heritage?<br>
<br>
No need to really explain why this is the most important.<br>

<br>
I was in the Hole Raid That night on Wednesday 9-12 with Sagemon I get a <br>
tell from Liedman &quot;Hi this is Qundi&quot;<br>
I reply &quot;Hey Bro what's up&quot;<br>
Liedman tells me &quot;I am being Banned from EQ&quot;<br>
Kaikachi sends me a tell &quot; Do you know Liedman&quot;<br>
I tell Kaikachi &quot;yes How can I help you&quot;<br>
Kaikachi tells me &quot;Can you tell me anything about him?&quot;<br>
I tell Kaikachi &quot; Leidman is Qundi alt and has been our Guild member in good standing for awhile&quot;<br>
Kaikachi tells me &quot;ok thank you&quot;<br>
I tell Kaikachi &quot;what happened?&quot;<br>
no reply<br>
waited a few and asked again<br>
no reply<br>
I sent a tell to Liedman &quot;what Happened?&quot;<br>
Liedman is not online<br>
I sent a tell to Qundi<br>
Qundi is not online<br>
I sent a tell to Kaikachi<br>
Kaikachi is not online<br>
<br>
Did I get screenshots of this   NO<br>
<br>
I was in a middle of a raid and the raid was fighting 3 rock Golem and the scam was horrible that I had to back away some just to get a chance to even scroll up what was being said to me<br>
<br>
I have no Idea who this new GM is all I know is He just been giving us problems <br>
<br>
Two weeks ago Gieve and I zoned into stonebrunt Mountains and when we zoned in a few minutes later I get a tell from Lecudian &quot;what happened?&quot;<br>
I asked Lecudian &quot;what?&quot;<br>
Lecudian says &quot;we are not in guild anymore&quot;<br>
which I look at Gieve and Gieve and I no longer had our Guild tag on<br>
We all agree that there was some kind of a bug and we all petitioned<br>
no GM or Guide was on<br>
The very next day when Nasye came on our Guild leader she petitioned.<br>
A guide answered her back and ask &quot;what was the problem?&quot;<br>
Nasye tells the Guide what has happened and the KoV got disbanded for no reason&quot;<br>
Guide told Nasye that &quot;there was a system bug that randomly disbanded a few Guilds I will make the report and get it to the GM to resolve this matter&quot;<br>
Nasye logged off and emailed a head GM in Verant about the problem and to try to get this fixed as soon as possible. <br>
Nasye gets emailed back and says that there was a bug that they hoped is fixed now and your server GM Kaikachi will be on between the hours 3pm-11pm PST and to send him a tell at that Time and he will fix the problem for you&quot;<br>
Nasye gets back on line at the time he is suppose to be on and petitioned A Guide  answered &quot;what is the problem?&quot;<br>
Nasye tells the guide to the events up to that time and needs to talk to Kaikachi.<br>
Guide tells Nasye he is here now but not online at the moment he will contact you as soon he gets on<br>
a period of time passes by then Kaikachi sends Nasye a tell <br>
&quot;what can I help you with?&quot;<br>
Nasye told Kaikachi what has happened and was told to talk to you to get the guild back<br>
Kaikachi asked &quot;who was the original leader of KoV?&quot;<br>
Nasye &quot;I think it was Gorak that was the original leader but we went thru some leadership change and I am and have been Leader og KoV for over a year now&quot;<br>
Kaikachi says &quot;you have to have the original leader to get the name back&quot;<br>
Nasye asked &quot;what?&quot;<br>
After over an hour of argueing it just came to tough shit for us!<br>
11 of the xKoV now membes logged off and went to chat to see what can we do and decided to start a new Guild so we went thru the proceedure  and put in an application for a new guild after we was done Nasye logged off and emailed the Head GM in Verant on what Kaikachi said. <br>
The next day Nasye gets a reply from the Head GM in Verant and he personely went thru the records and found Nasye as the leader of KoV and instructed Kaikachi to reinstate us ASAP!<br>
Nasye gets back on at the time he is suppose to be on and petitioned again asking to speaking to Kaikachi<br>
Kaikachi sent her a tell and ask &quot;what was your Guild Name?&quot;<br>
Nasye says &quot;Knights of Virtue&quot;<br>
then Nasye had the Guild Tag back and Kaikachi says you have to reinvite the rest back in<br>
So we was all going around tracking all the KoV members and got them reinstated.<br>
We are still missing a few and most of us has them on our friend list waiting for them to get back on.<br>
<br>
I believe in what Qundi says and we encouraged him to email Verant of what has happened and to give them all info on what was said, time of the day, who you talk to and they have records of what transpired between you and Kaikachi<br>
<br>
I hope that Verant will look into this matter and serve Kaikachi head to us<br>
