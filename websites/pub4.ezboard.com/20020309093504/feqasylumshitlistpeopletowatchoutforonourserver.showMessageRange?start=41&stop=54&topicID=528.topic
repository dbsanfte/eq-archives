I apologize for the misunderstanding and I am sorry to hear that you got left in CT, i myself have probably died 20-plus times trying to port to CT to pick some one up or porting there to go fight, it is a very dangerous place even at the higher levels for us fragial castors heh.<br>
<br>
 Jeka, you ask me to disprove you, well fine&quot; I DID NOT DO WHAT YOU ARE CLAIMING I DID! &quot; There, happy.<br>
I would defenatly remember doing it(i may not be the greatest speller but believe it or not my memory is quite good<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am glad you are &quot;done&quot; with me and would appreaciate that you not use things that are untruthful to try and ruin my reputation. Apparently you do not like me, this is fine i can live with the fact that a person and his brother who I have maybe talked to a handful of times(well i got along with nibl well enough when he was in ES and when he came on one of me and Hess's fear raids) I never have known you as Jeka and apparently did not deal with you much when you were chuba or what ever his name is because i do not recall that name either. Maybe we had a run in or something in SK but i hardly doubt it as I did treants almost the entire time i was in SK and warriors were not allowed in treants back at that time<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, if you want to dislike me go right ahead, Ive learned that you cant please every one, and have turned my attentions to the people i am friends with. Also i did a little checking up on you to try and figure out why you might have a trouble with me and after talking to a few peps i have a good hunch why this suddenly came out out of no where. I am not going to go into details since my hunch could be wrong, and even if it isnt i dont want to drag those people into this and start a damn flaming war. <br>
<br>
 So here is my plea to you, you do not care for me, no problem. If i come back i will make sure not to interact with you or group/raid with you since you apperantly do not want my company. You speak of maturiy, fine then prove some yourself. This is ended, do not respond on here, do not go flaming away on some other board, just end it. I will not respond to you directly anymore on this board or any other place. I have stated the truth and my friends know that i would not do such a thing even though what you claim i did still does not make sense to me, and seems very petty anyway and considering that it happened SOOO long ago and that i have not ever talked to you i think it is safe to say that holding a huge grudge would appear somewhat child like. On that note, I say good bye to you and wish you the best on lanys.<br>
<br>
 It seems evident that the new raist needs to be taught some things and i wish the code the best with teaching her, and give you guys kudios for helping her.<br>
THink that about sums it all up, lorian im still trying to get on to give ya a tell and see whats up so dont think i forgot about ya<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Been having HUGE isp problems and ever time i get on i got like 60000ping on the left side and i cant do much but get killed then rezzed then killed all over again in guk heh.

One day Raist comes on line.  It is VERY obvious to me, right off that this is NOT the Rasit that I know.<br>
<br>
I send tells to Raist asking who they are.  Raist tells me that he is the same Raist as always.  The NEW Raist had no idea that I was guild leader or would know.  I checked with Raist RL brother and varified that the NEW Raist is indeed a NEW Raist.<br>
<br>
I talked to the New Raist to find out what EQ history she has.  If she knows to play the class.  I dod give her guidance on grouping and raids.  Some of her jokes were not appropiate, I tried to explain this.<br>
<br>
The ES Officers and HC discussed the matter, informally and decided that because the new Raist had not applied and was guilded only because the old Raist left the char guilded, she should be removed and asked to apply as any recruit.<br>
<br>
The New Raist may not know all the ins and outs of grouping and raiding, but she did seem to want to learn.  She did take advis.  She is welcome to apply to ES.  I do hope that things work out with her in The Code.  I wish her the best.<br>

This is simple disagreement, if you can't handle that, then I suggest you stay away from me, because I can and will disagree with you whenever I wish. The problem is, I have witnesses and other victims I know in-game.<br>
<br>
I asked you to send a tell to two of them while on Nibl. When asked, they said they never received any tell. It's a bit more complicated than me &quot;lying&quot;. <br>
<br>
I can back myself up just fine, you can't. No one is lying here but you, and I don't think it's any suprise that I dislike you. I have the right to dislike people, and if you think that's holding a grudge, you're way off.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am responding to you even though I said I was done with you, and that's because I dislike cowards too, people who strike at someone's back. I was done with you, but apparently you were not with me, so I am once again addressing you.<br>
<br>
To the new Raist, these posts don't take me more than 5-10 minutes of my real life, I assure you I have a job, I have a car, I have many friends, and plenty of time to play EQ as a hobby. Quit being foolish though, this isn't about other people, it's about you. You can throw any type of attacks you wish, but make sure you're not the one that looks like an idiot.<br>
<br>
No, there were other wizards there Raist, and all of them excluding you were rather mature, sent tells to the leader, and awaited the random lotto, while you were jumping and shouting, wouldn't let Limdul loot his staff for about a minute, spamming the zone, and you didn't seem very happy for Limdul with &quot;grats...I guess&quot;.<br>

Sits down, shuts up.  D00d doesn't seem to know ANYTHING about the game.  <br>

Ive witnessed the short fuse, and Im currently trying to figure out how to deal with it.  We all have to admit this is not a typical online game, this does not excuse the actions but could possibly lead to its source.  We are trying to help the new raist learn how this game is, and direct the proper attitude to the community.  Im sure at one time or another we all have felt the frustration of not finding a group, and Im also sure we have all handled it differently.  Im hoping that we can calm the nerves about the game, so that raist doesnt explode at people.  As with any member, if this attitude towards people continues I will be forced to remove them from our group. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uasterothchrismatica.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asteroth Chrismatica</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/27/01 9:56:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=528.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Raist</span><hr size=1> Hiya guys,<br>

I am not asking for his past to be absolved, forgotten, or erased.  This character has inflamed many another, and regardless who is in the helm its something this character must live with.  I think its healthy for raist to hear what has transpired before to create such animosity, it will help the new controller to understand.  Sometimes its difficult to see the ramifications of your actions, but perhaps with the knowledge of what has transpired before raist can be a better gamer for this community. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=528.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=528.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showPrevMessage?topicID=528.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showNextMessage?topicID=528.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=528.topic&index=54><img src=http://www.unbeliever.net/images/lanys/postreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.emailToFriend?topicID=528.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.threadControl?topicID=528.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=528.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=528.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
