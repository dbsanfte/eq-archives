I'm sure several people out there have 4x of each of those specs on their comp, and can't run Luclin. Me? I can run it. 5-10 minute zones, and i crash on about every 6th zone (every hour or so), but it works. VI has some MAJOR kinks to work out in the code, as with the previous expansions. However, EQ still serves half of it's purpose as a SOCIAL game, although playability is a joke currently. Try soloing when you can't cast a 4 sec spell in the time it takes a snared mob to reach you, beat you to a pulp, and return home. I was dead in GD on an elite before i knew root broke. I've heard DSL isn't much improved, so it's not your system that causes it, it's just a few &quot;well-placed&quot; bugs.<br>

<br>
For instance, I currently run a Athlon 1.4 with 256 DDR and a V5500 on win98. When I loaded SoL, I ignored the warning and selected all character models etc. Now, zone time was increased to about a minute and a half. But I had no other major issues or even graphic lag until I hit ToV for our LtK killing. Then it was some pretty bad video lag but still manageable.<br>
<br>
The point is, I know how to strip my machine down to lean performance levels and how to tweak other settings. Many users do not know this and therefore the machines they have can be way overspec and still have issues. I don't think VI took this into account or maybe Sony just said &quot;get the damn game out of the doors on time&quot;.<br>
<br>
Who knows? Just do your best to have fun. Maybe that means taking a short break from EQ while they fix it for you. <p><small><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Celdor Dreamweaver - Bard (EQ)<br><a href="http://members.home.net/mahkt/"><b>Midnight Fury</b></a><br><br><i>"Let me tell you something pendejo, you pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash your piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'till it goes click...Nobody fucks with the Jesus."</i>

Anyway, we all knew months, lemme say that again,*months* ago that this expansion was coming out. We also had a general idea as to what was going to be required to run the expansion. Although the week or so before they release, we get a shocker that we needed more RAM than anticipated. I knew that my old system would not run Luclin. I needed a new vid card, more RAM and memory. With all that, it was going to cost me a pretty penny. So I saved up and prepared a month before hand to upgrade my comp. I see the new specs and see that I needed a whole lot more. So I bought a whole new system. My old one was outdated, and I was going to buy my kids a computer anyway. <br>
<br>
Here is the point, we knew this was going to happen. We knew that there would be multipul problems with the whole new engine they planned on handing out to us with this expansion. I am surprised that the graphics are as good as they are considering the upgrade they just did. We bitched and moaned seeing how cool DAoC looked or AO for that matter, we wanted that, we wanted more. Well we got it, and frankly the game, in my opinion is fantastic. It works fine for me with the exception that I zone slow. Oh well, shit happens. <br>
<br>
The whole of it is...this wasnt sprung on us the day before, that we needed more specs on some of our computers. Going through alot of these posts and alot of your all running still on Win98 , it was never ment to take on 512RAM, that in itself is a problem, not VI's problem, your problem, microsoft made it that way, not VI. <br>
<br>
Okay so there are still ways to work around that problem and still use Win98, however any future games that come out, wont be compatable with Win98. Thats a fact that you are going to have to face. DAoC needs high specs to play, my old comp wouldnt play that either. Any new games that are coming out, older comps and programs are not going to play.Thats just how it is, my new comp will be outdated in a month, thats how the economy of it and how fast technology advances these days. <br>
<br>
We wanted more we got it, but at a price. One I was willing to pay, along with many others. Alot of us have been playing and dealing with the bugs of this game for a year and even more than that. You cant jump up and down and act naive about it all now. We knew the bugs and glitches and non play problems were coming with this.  The long and the short of it is, we knew the facts before they dropped it on us. Alot of us are hard core players, we know how it all works, that whatever new online game that gets released is not going to be perfect, how something works in Beta, is NOT going to work that way on the release program, no matter how we wish it that way.  VI is not stupid about this either, many will be attracted to the new aspects of this game, alot of defecters to DAoC are coming back, they have the systems obviously to play EQ Luc, VI anticipated this, they also knew they might lose customers to. You win some, you lose some, thats just how it is. <br>
<br>
Now of course you can flame away, if it was me having problems I would be screaming bloody murder<br>
 ........and then go out and get my comp fixed so it could play EQ. I wanted to play the expansion, so I paid. I love EQ no matter how bad some aspects of customer service and programing problems there are....eventually all the bugs will be kinked out along with the programing glitches.   <p><center><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/dfitzpatrick/Anasig5.jpg"></a></center>

Is it a picture from E&amp;BO? If you odnt know what Im talking about then it does't matter.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Tuan first. Yes. People who have above the minimum specifications, new drivers and DX8.1 and no luclin are having troubles playing EQ. Some crash, some lag, some experience massive problems and resets.<br>
<br>
Ananiel, I'll put money says a lot of people looked at the minimum specs 3 months ago and said &quot;ok, im borderline&quot; but then had to buy new computers because they couldnt meet the new ones posted 10 days before the game went live.<br>
<br>
Personally I looked at Intel Pentium III processor or equivalent and thought...whew, my AMD is better then that and surprise surprise EQ does not fully support the chipset yet. I looked at my ram and thought I was just above the recommended amount. Then it went up and I found that I was going to suffer. I'd also wager a fair amount that if it hadn't been for the known problem of 98 not supporting more then 512MB ram then that recommended would have been higher.<br>
<br>
I blame bad programming. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
I started having trouble with this machine in Windows ME. I got fed up with tweaking the damn thing and upgraded it to 2000. Nearly all troubles went away. This might fix problems for some people, 2000 manages memory very differently than the 95/98/ME model. This is still much slower than my new machine and has a problem with occaisional few seconds of 'freeze' even in 2000,  also the soundcard sometimes gets 'stuck' replaying the same few notes but gameplay is ok, it works..kinda. I think it should work better , but it is still a pretty nice machine.<br>
<br>
New Machine<br>

256mgs Ram<br>
Nvidia GeForceIII DTI 64 meg<br>
Soundblaster Live!<br>

<br>
I thought this machine would end all my problems. I followed the formula available to me at the time(bought it just before they upped the requirements). I guess I could add another 512mg ram just to be sure right? It runs great(very high framerate ) with 14 models and social animations on. But guess what? I still have a problem with occaisional freeze and<br>
the soundcard wierdness. Just like on the old machine!<br>
<br>
I posted the above to point out that I am one of those crazies who went and bought a machine just for EQ and there are STILL problems. Not to mention with just one or two upgrades my old system meets or exceeds the recommended configuration, so I should be ok. For all of you apologists out there ;P. <br>
<br>
I agree with Walterscott. It is just plain stupid to endanger your customer base the way verant has. This implementation reminds me a lot of stuff that Origin used to pull. It's one thing to insist that you have currently acceptable hardware.<br>
It's completely another to demand that you have to be near the top of the performance bar just to run 'program X'. There have been several franchises that lost thier popularity due to these kinds of reasons. Verant is in danger of losing out to DOAC and possibly Shadowbane. They are upping the ante to try and insure that dosen't happen. The Ultima Series and Falcon 4.0 are just two examples of franchises that tried to keep thier lead through being the absolute 'Top of the Line' performance wise. Both of those franchises are dead. If Verant dosen't fix thier problems. I believe they will join thier friends Lord British and F-16. <p>If I was an Autobot, I'd be:<br>

That was a given.<br>
When System Shock was first released you needed God's Own Computer(tm) to play it in hi-res, same with Magic Carpet and Mechwarrior 2. The fact is, all 3 of these games (fucking classics, all 3 of them) were playable in low-res, on a 486 DX2-66 with 2Mb onboard video card.<br>
Luclin is barely playable at all, even for people who exceed the recommended specs. It is also bug-ridden. Funcom must be laughing their Norwegian asses off right now.<br>

2 Verry different systems with the same ammount of network traffic.  <br>
my primary machine runs great.  The only problem I have at all is with zone time, and the dam center plaza in Shar Vahl. I run with all spell effects on, all modles on, clip plane off, Animations on, Mip Maping on, and have not disabled Hardware T&amp;L. I run at 1280x1024 resolution usualy.  although I can run in 1600x1200 just as well, but even on a 19&quot; monitor I cannot read the dam text. I have yet to attend a raid with these options on, so cannot say what 36 casting moving PC's and 8 moving mobs on screen will do, but I think it will be X-Lax smooth.<br>
<br>
My 2nd PC also has luclin installed.  I have turned off all the new textures, mip mapping, and Hardware T&amp;L (on a voodoo umm yea riight). Thier is no clip plane, and I run in 1024x768 res.  No lag . . . . outside of luclin zones.  I can run a few of the modles as well, but after looking at them on my pri PC it is a joke. (this is like sacrafice Vs Deus ex bad).  zoning in the old world is a bit slower than it used to be, but not bad at all. luclin zoning is about as slow as my pri PC.  I have not tested it, but I would probly estimate 1 min or so.<br>
<br>
I consider myself to be a computer geek and have tweaked both systems for max performance, OS, DX, Drivers, and BIOS have all been tweaked, JUST to run games.  I buy hardware that I can tweak to make up for bad system peformance.  (yes I am an avid overclocker but neither system is running over standard now).  my biggest problem so far has been that they are always patching while I should be playing.<br>
<br>
I like luclin, it was a great upgrade for people who's system could handle it. I like the graphics engine and think it works perty well for somthing that was laid down on an existing frame work.  As much as I personaly enjoy it though, I do not like the fact that many people do not have the computer systems to be able to run luclin, but what options were thier?<br>
release it as a differnt title?  EQ 2.0  where the moon hit's your eye like a big pizza pie, tha . . . . .<br>
Say Fuck it We at verant have decided that an undertaking of this magnitude is simply not going to work.  thank you good night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=windzer>Windzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/11/01 5:38:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> lol,i couldn't run EQ in another res if i wanted too, i have a geforce 2 too, kinda sad... =P<br>
