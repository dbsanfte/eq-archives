<br>
Not having much else to do, I ran to the city of Oggok, home of the ogres, where I had heard I could find a rare blossom required by a master later in the quest.  I spoke to the ogre in question, who was distressed about her garden.  Having seen and picked up a pair of muddy sandals when I had first entered the city and was speaking to a merchanter there, I handed them to her.  She matched the footprints, and was furious upon realizing who had ruined her garden.  <br>
The ogre sent me back to the merchant with a note.  He seemed very apologetic, and gave me a gift to take back to her.  The ogress opened the chest, and was delighted to find a big bunch of very beautiful white flowers.  I realized these must be the Snow Blossoms I had heard about.  I realized it would be awkward to ask for one, seeing as they were a gift, but was about to do so when she graciously offered me one out of thanks for running their messages.  I had acquired an item needed for the quest!<br>
<br>
Feeling an adrenaline rush, I decided to continue my epic questing with some of the other items I figured I could do on my own.  I hopped on a boat for the Overthere, fearing what the residents would think of me, after having hunted in Kaesora on another quest.  Luckily, they were only apprehensive about it, and with a faction spell, amiable.  I turned in a couple spells, and to my great surprise, received the only two 50+ spells I had yet to scribe - Wake of Tranquility, and Boon of the Clear Mind (Got it, but thatnks anyway Llorian =D  hehe).  Surprised at my luck, I headed off to find an item known as "The One Key" which was supposedly on a mesa in the Overthere.<br>
Finding such a small item was no simple task.  Following my senses as well as the aid of locations on a map, I reached the canyon where the key was rumored to be.  In air elemental form, I could float down to the item and retrieve it.  But which mesa was it on?  There were so many, and I was too high up to see something so small very well.  I walked around the entire canyon, staring down onto the mesas below, and wishing I had a telescope or "Preserved Split Paw Eye" with which to see better.  Finally, well on the other side of the mountain, I saw a glint of light from the dust on a small mesa far below.  I couldn't be sure if it was the key, or perhaps some small stone, but I decided to find out for myself.  I floated off the canyon and down, down to the mesa, glad to see that the glint was indeed from the key.  I picked it up, happy with myself, and placed it in my pack with the flower.<br>
<br>
"Now what, Daeon?"  I thought to myself.<br>
"Perhaps I should commission a wizard to whisk me off to the Plane of Sky to retrieve the fabled Book of Charm and Sacrifice."<br>
Then, I remembered hearing of the Lost Scroll being in the clutches of some Sarnaks in a hidden dungeon in Warslik's Woods.  Knowing that the zone was nearby, I decided to check it out.  Could I brave an entire dungeon full of beasts on my own?  I was about to find out.<br>
<br>
After much searching along the shoreline, I found a tunnel entrance that was sure to lead to the Crypt of Dalnir, as the place was called.  Under the cover of Improved Invisility (May the Gods bless the author of this spell for all eternity), I passed through illusionary water of sorts into the dungeon.  I was horrified to find that the place was guarded mainly by spellbound members of other races - not by sarnaks.  The upper floors were patrolled by Coerced Tier'Dal, Gnomes, Erudites, and more.  Bypassing these poor souls as well as the wandering goos, I stealthily made my way deeper into the dungeon, pausing to refresh my invisibility when it was safe to do so.  I saw more and more Sarnaks along the way, until they were the only creatures around me.  Despite their weak appearance compared to my level of experience, I knew one false move and I would have throngs of them attacking me, something which would truly test my skills as an enchanter, however, something which I would rather avoid.  <br>
The creatures seemed to be experimenting on the frogloks of the region, having various froglok body parts in jars, surrounded by wizards and other magic users.  Fearing one of them may be able to see the invisible, I hasted my movements, and frantically searched the nearby rooms, hoping to find the scroll unguarded, so I could grab it undetected.  I entered one room with a bookcase, and figured it had to be in there - this was where they kept their research.  Not seeing anything on the shelves, I stumbled across faded parchment lying on the floor partially under a bed (no doubt for weary scientists after all-night experimentation sessions).  I quickly glanced at it and knew it to the Lost Scroll.  Placing it in my pack, and still invisible, I turned the corner and stepped into the portal used to exit the dungeon.  I had achieved my goal, and was now three pieces closer to the Staff.<br>
<br>
My next goal was to snag the Book of Charm and Sacrifice from Sky.  However, the Gods spoke to me, and asked me to wait a couple hours before making my attempt.  So, I came here to record my adventures thus far.<br>
<br>
(Woulda gotten the book, but they dropped the damn servers for a two hour emergency patch.. Bah.  Ah well, I'll grab it when they come back up.  hehe  All in all, I had a lot of fun, even though I was by myself all night.. hehe.. enjoyed relaying what happened to my guild, and they liked hearing it.  ;)  I felt productive, for the first time in a while..  hehe)</font><P><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig2.jpg><br>
