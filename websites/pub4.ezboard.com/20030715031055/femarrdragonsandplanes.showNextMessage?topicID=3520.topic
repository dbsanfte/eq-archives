HOUSTON (AP) - Suspecting her husband of having an affair, Clara Harris did what wealthy wives can afford to do: She hired an investigator. But what the private eye saw could become Exhibit A against Harris herself.<br>
<br>
As the investigator's video camera rolled, an enraged Harris allegedly killed her husband in a parking lot by running him over three times with her silver Mercedes-Benz and leaving the car parked on top of him. The victim's 16-year-old daughter was in the passenger seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was an accident,&quot; Harris, a 44-year-old dentist, told reporters after her arrest on murder charges<br>
<br>
&quot;She jumped the median and ran over him three times,&quot; Nassau Bay police Lt. Joe M. Cashiola told the Houston Chronicle. &quot;I saw the daughter lying on the ground, crying uncontrollably and sobbing. She had to watch her dad 5 feet from her, underneath the car, while they're putting her mom in handcuffs.&quot;<br>
<br>
A witness, Angela Reyes, told the Chronicle that David Harris' teenage daughter from a previous marriage jumped out of the car and punched Clara Harris in the face. Clara Harris yelled toward her husband: &quot;I'm so sorry! I love you! Keep breathing!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Harrises lived with their 3-year-old twin sons in a $560,000 white stone and brick mansion with a long, winding driveway on nearly four acres in the suburb of Friendswood. A woman who answered the door last week said Clara Harris had no comment<br>
<br>
Harris' attorney, George Parnham, said last week that she will plead innocent at her Aug. 23 arraignment. She remains free on $30,000 bail.<br>
<br>
WHAT THE FUUCK ??? The bitch is on BAIL for 30k.. OMFG!<br>
<br>
I bet every Godmn Feminist in the freeking World is jumping to this KILLERS Side !!<br>
<br>
AND,, She is out on bail..<br>
<br>
Imagine a MAN doing this..!! Go ahead.. Imagine... And on tape...<br>
<br>
Now Imagine that Man being out on BAIL.. HAHAHAhahahahahaaha .. *Choke cough,, die.....NEVER !<br>
<br>
All you Bastards and Your fathers fell assleep and let <br>
the Feminists take over the Laws.. And YOU !!!!!<br>
<br>
WAKE THE HELLL UP !!!!!! NOW !!!!!!!!! WAKE UP !!!!!!!<br>
<br>
HELLLLOOOOOOOOOOO YOU !!! HEY YOU !!!<br>
<br>
Would he be out on bail ??<br>
<br>
This world has become a Feminest society guys !!!<br>
Get off your asses and Stop leading your life with your<br>
dick in your hand !!<br>
<br>
Feminazi's are cuunts pure and simple. Bitches with <br>
mouths for power.. And no Brains.. <br>
<br>

<br>
Oh wait. But she was under duress.. She didnt put out.<br>
But thats no reason for him to get it elsewhere.. Ohhh.<br>
Poor little bitch.. So she runs him over..<br>
<br>
WHY ?? Ask Why ??? Hmm Couldnt be that *$560,000 white stone and brick mansion with a long, winding driveway on nearly four acres in the suburb of Friendswood* Could it ???<br>
<br>
No man would ever get out on bail for this !! EVER&gt;&gt;&gt;!~!<br>
<br>
QUOTE,,,,,,<br>
Parnham, who unsuccessfully defended Andrea Yates, the Houston mother who claimed insanity after drowning her five children in the bathtub, suggested that this case, too, would hinge on the defendant's state of mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Obviously, something triggered what happened,&quot; Parnham said. &quot;This was not an act that was anyway akin to the mentality of Clara Harris. We have a professional person who is very intelligent. When you see the man that you love in the arms of someone else - that has to have such a deep emotional impact on you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Um HELLO ??? When the Fuuck did this become HER as a VICTUM ??????<br>

Being RICH and a highly visible member of the community, and thus unlikely to jump bail, had EVERYTHING to do with it.<br>
<br>
As for what her attorney is saying . . . that's what he's SUPPOSED to be saying.  He's her ATTORNEY.  It's his JOB to defend her.  By the way . . . this is the same guy who lost the Andrea Yates case.  He's not doing too well with the emotionally unbalanced woman defense anyway.<br>
<br>
If you really think woman have the power you're ascribing to them, you must have had a real bad time with your mommy while growing up . . . or a succession of girlfriends dump you because they got sick of your misogyny . . . or are still a frustrated, pimply, overweight virgin.  Personally, I'm leaning toward number one and three.<br>

Wake up guys, do you realize you're a hair's breath from spouting the mindset of certain serial killers? Never thought of that, did ya? Yeah yeah they're old jokes, ha ha he he ho ho and all. The person who hasn't been hurt by the opposite sex is a rare, rare one, I know I'm not one of them. I've been hurt plenty, but you don't see me yapping about how all men are the scum of the earth. Because, umm, all men aren't. Certain men may be, sure, and certain women may be, too.<br>
<br>
You know a lot of women today are terrified to mention the word 'feminism' because of the crazy lengths so-called 'feminists' go to? So uhh, guess I'm not one, I don't want to be branded with that crowd. There's certain issues I think still need to be worked on in society, yeah, regarding rights and standings and such....<br>
<br>
But that woman above isn't someone I'd be likely to defend. How can you possibly defend what she did?! Right now I don't see how. Now I know her lawyer has to, they have to defend right or wrong, which is yet another reason why we think lawyers are scum.<br>
<br>
But come on, sheesh. Male or female, a crime commited is a crime commited and wrong. Call this a wake up call? In what form or fashion? Rich people get to walk free on bail all the time. What's different about this case? I don't think it's RIGHT, most people probably don't, male OR female.<br>
<br>
Just please, tell me what's so amazingly eye-opening about this one case, that's NEVER happened before?<br>

<br>
Back on track here,<br>
<br>
Since my certainly unmindless (if thats a word) Post.<br>
And driving over 150 miles today., I had time to<br>
contimplate the facts of this one.<br>
<br>
First off. I thought about the Investigators. (I'll get back to them later !)<br>
And also the fact that she was there AT the hotel with<br>
her child and His child from a previous marriage.<br>
Why ? well there are a number of possibilitys. But the<br>
first one is that the investigators alerted her to the location. BIG MISTAKE in PI work..<br>
<br>
Secondly since she was alerted, She knew there would<br>
be a scene with him and his lover. Then why bring<br>
the 2 Girls ?? I would bet they had no idea what they<br>
were about to witness. I BET she wanted the 2 girls<br>
so see it to gain the support of them for the divorce.<br>
<br>
But,, and this is only my theory, The girls or at least <br>
the Fathers daughter from the previous marriage did not<br>
see it that way.. And got into a very heated argument<br>
in the Silver Mercades.. And in the process making <br>
Serial MOM even more crazy knowing her (Two fingers)<br>
Plan was not working.. GASP !<br>
<br>
And at that very moment of ANGER !! not Distress or<br>
all that Fany crap you Fems throw in,, Real ANGER.<br>
<br>
She Saw an opportunity and Took it.. <br>
Not once, Not Twice, But three times.. And thats when<br>
the daughter of His previous maggiage got out and <br>
Punched the bitch..<br>
<br>
See, Anger is like Being drunk, It can be controlled..<br>
Fact is she knew she was going to witness something.<br>
And I cannot imagine the PI's giving her the info if they<br>
thought she was Unstable.. Thats a FACT.. And thats <br>
one of the Worst sins in PI work.. HUGE mistake..<br>
<br>
Now about the PI Punks that gave in to her being there.<br>
And yes I am sure they did. PI work is exausting and time<br>
consuming, and Rarely pays unless your contracted for<br>
a very large corperation.<br>
<br>
They screwed up.. And BAD.. They broke the rules..<br>
First she did not have to be there. Especially since they<br>
were taping everything and documenting it all for <br>
what I would suspect, Divorce court to get the Mansion.<br>
And I promise you. She couldn't afford that as a dentist!!<br>
<br>
<br>
OK. well. I have to eat dinner. And think about this a bit <br>
more.. <br>
<br>
Post your thoughts on this event.. It's just plain crazy.\<br>

<br>
<br>
And one more thought,<br>
Since this lady being a sucessful Buisness woman, And<br>
working in a fast tough place such as any medical<br>
facility. She would have the Anger management to<br>
control herself.. <br>
<br>
This was Planned from the start IMO. And she should<br>
be charged with 1st Degree Murder..<br>
<br>
Also another theory I want to make is that I bet <br>
SHE Was the Lover from his previous Marriage And KNEW<br>
he could afford to gain custody.. Thats why she wanted<br>
to kill him.. and I'll bet you pennies to dollars that<br>
when All the crap has been slung we will see<br>
the Truth about her Evil.. And her friends pushing her<br>
along to take action, Or she would lose it all..<br>
<br>
Ok thats it. im eating.. ! Im making Chinese food tonite.<br>
General Tso's Chicken, Won Ton Soup with Scallops,<br>
and BEEF KUSHISASHI.. YUM !!!<br>

All the same, keep your secrets away from me, if you wanna be mine.<BR><CENTER>SugarCult</CENTER></H6></FONT><BR><BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=3534.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3534.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3534.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3534.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3534.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3534.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3534.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3534.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
