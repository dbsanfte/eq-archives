Before any of you roll your eyes and say, &quot;oh, God, another 9/11 thing,&quot; hear me out.<br>
<br>
This is the one forum where every bigoted, mean spirited, and spiteful statement we emit is &quot;justified.&quot;  So, today, I'm going to go up against the general spirit of this particular forum and ask those of you reading this to remember those you love, and conjure the courage, even for just a day, to forgive those who have wronged you.<br>
<br>
I believe no one has the right to press ill intent against another human being under the guise of freedom of speech and expression.  That is perversion of an ideal.  We are a lucky, lucky group of people to live in America.  We are lavished in luxuries, but always, we continue to ask for more.  There is no more to give, you see, and it's taken tragedy of monumental proportions to remind many of us just how fortunate we are.<br>
<br>
For decades we lived in a bubble of bliss we confused for an impenetrable shield.  We never denied the possibility of an attack on American soil, but it was an idea we never entertained and refused to fathom.  Then one morning, thousands died.  Two buildings that embodied our pride in our economic strength were both struck down.  The headquarter of our military was struck, as well.  Thankfully, the White House didn't suffer a similar fate, but instead, 45 people died in Pennsylvania.  Commercial jets carrying living, breathing people were turned into missiles a year ago.  Even now, the thought astounds me and I've still yet to understand why.<br>
<br>
My mother called me a year ago at 8am.  It's minutes past 8am right now here.  My husband almost didn't come home that day, as he serves on a nuclear submarine in the U.S. Navy.  My first concern was of him, if he'd come home.  I was worried because I had just moved up to WA to be with him the day before and was unfamiliar with the area.  But, as I continued to watch the news on T.V., my concern shifted from myself and fixated on the tragedy.  It horrified me.  It was an act so inconceivable that it shook me to my core.  A piece of each of us died that day- namely, our sense of safety and security.  I believe many of us still mourn, if not for the loss of a loved one, then for the loss of our innocence.<br>
<br>
It shouldn't take a tragedy of this scale to bring people together.  It should never take the death of a person to appreciate what you have.  It shouldn't take pain, suffering and sorrow to propel us to look at the bigger picture.<br>
<br>
There are still widows calling homeless shelters in the NYC area to see if their husbands are there.  Mothers are at ground zero right now, remarking that their child is still down there.  A parent-less child is being carried around ground zero right at this moment.  Flowers are scattered across the dust where thousands who thought they were going to L.A. or just going to a day at work didn't make it to L.A. and didn't make it home.<br>
<br>
We fight out our differences in this forum, and I think many times we do it out of boredom.  Sometimes, the arguments get so heated that we go at each others throats and condemn each other for merely expressing their opinions.  Often times, we hide behind &quot;free speech&quot; when we speak hateful words.  We've called each other stupid, lazy, greedy,  dumb, crazy, idiotic, insane, misled, misguided, uneducated, vermin, trash, etc., for not agreeing to our religious beliefs, for not speaking a language we understand, for not living in accordance to our own personal moral codes... for basically not being more like &quot;me.&quot;  We bleed the same color.  We all cry salt tears.  We all feel hurt when we're injured, and we all feel devastation when we lose someone we love.  We all know what love feels like, and we all know the pain of sorrow.<br>
<br>
My problems are so small in comparison.  I complain when my coffee isn't served hot enough and I complain even more when its too hot.  I complain that there's not enough to do, that I'm bored.  I whine about the price of gas.  I hate cooking because some days it's too bothersome to turn on the stove.  I don't back down from arguments with my husband the night before because I figure I have tomorrow to do it; he'll probably forget after he wakes up in the morning, anyway.  I complain that though there is always tomorrow, it doesn't come fast enough or it's coming too fast.  Either I worry or complain about the speed of the impending future or I'm agonizing about the past.  My attention is never in the here and the now.  So, let me set some things right.<br>
<br>
All the people I call friends are dear to me.  You know who you are.  You've provided me comfort, counsel, and lovely company.  My biggest fear is being alone and I thank you for your patience in seeing through the hard exterior to find underneath is somebody who is very much frail, very fragile, and often very scared- you've all never abandoned me in my times of need and have always been willing to reassure me I'm not alone.  There are many of you, but I'd like to especially thank Grammaw, Desecration and Arcturos.  Arcturos, I'm sorry we haven't spoken much at all, but you inspired a degree of goodness in me and I was truly touched by your kindness- nobody's ever sent me flowers before just to cheer me up and it meant the world to me (I also still have kung fu monkey).<br>
<br>
Just as importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to everybody and anybody I've rubbed the wrong way.  To anybody I've abused my wit and communicative ability against, I am sorry.  Don't let one woman's insecurity offend you.  Forgive my trespasses.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter what sexual orientation we are, what language we speak, or whether we believe in gun control or how we stand on abortion- death, sorrow, and suffering strikes indiscriminately.  <br>
<br>
Let's not forget what we clearly understand now:<br>
<br>
We are, each and every one of us, precious.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucoajikdeloloth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coajik Deloloth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/02 8:36:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3617.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply</span><hr size=1> /salute Aishen<br>

I’ve decided that it’s best if I don’t speak to anyone, it may not be nice but it’s definitely not projecting my current mood in their general direction. There is, of course, one thing that could rectify this surly state of mine… Perhaps if I was to get together with, oh, lets say, an Asian girl, a Swedish girl, a couple albino midgets, a Mule, 2 Mimes, the Iron Chef and a 50 gallon drum of Wesson Cooking Oil - things would be just peachy.<br>

Well said Aishen.<br>
<br>
A few things to add.<br>
Your husband on the nuclear submarine when out to sea is actually in one of THE SAFEST places to be in the event of just about any kind of disaster.  So rest easy on that point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You said:<br>
&quot;It shouldn't take a tragedy of this scale to bring people together.&quot;<br>
<br>
Absolutely right!  The same way people only donate food on or around Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas.  What the heck do the needy eat the OTHER 363 days of the year?  Harry Chapin (deceased singer/songwriter for you younger folks, wrote &amp; sang &quot;Cats in the Cradle&quot; if that rings a bell) said it better than I in the Gold Medal collection.<br>
<br>
Regardless, the tragedy HAS brought people together today, which is one way to bring something good out of something so horrible.  <br>
<br>
I joined about a hundred other volunteers today for several hours as we fixed up a senior citizen housing complex that has seen better days due to city budget cutbacks.  We used today as &quot;A Day of Caring&quot;.  We also took a moment of silence this morning at my base, played the National Anthem again at 8:46, and flew the Stars &amp; Stripes at half-mast today.  It won't bring anyone who lost their life back to us, but it will help us to never forget, and volunteering to help others will bring something good out of all the misery from a year ago.

<br>
     I understand how you feel.  A year ago my wife felt the same way.  Fear and uncertainty will always follow an event like this for a long time.  Today when I got up to go to work (out of the Navy now but work at a Shipyard) I was happy to see that we were all here.  No one took a day off, or stayed home.  I think thats a pretty good statement.  We came to work the same as always, life has continued and we have shown that we aren't afraid.  In that, they (the terrorists) have failed.  For all our differences, we are strong and united.  I hope that stays and isn't a passing fancy.  I hope that we never forget.  I hope that we as a nation, and the world as a whole take this event to heart and actually make good of it.<br>

I HAVE posted it in the America Under Attack section but it hardly got viewed so, here it is:<br>
<br>
Today is going to bring about to our great nation a day of special remembrance, tears, and sorrow in our hearts for all our fallen heroes taken from us on the day of cowardly acts of terrorism. Every single person that lost their lives on 9-11 is a hero to me. They brought together a nation of people that show the world that we will not tolerate this barbaric action against Americans.<br>
 <br>
My grandfather passed on to me a sense of patriotism as a little girl as he told me stories of being taken prisoner of war for 2 1/2 years during WWII. He suffered and endured memories of these times for the duration of his lifetime. He had already passed away before 9-11, but I know if he had still been here to witness this tragedy, he would have wept tears that I would have never been able to comprehend. He was not a well educated man, dropping out of school during the Depression as a boy, to be able to work and help feed his family. But he was one of the smartest men I have ever known. He had been throughout the world and his everlasting words to me were, &quot;No matter what the trouble our nation has had, its ups and down, scandals, and crimes, we still live in the greatest country in the world. Be proud to be an American and thank the Lord by his graces that you had the good fortune to be born and raised as an American.&quot; These are words that I live by and have shared with the people I know. <br>
<br>
My heart swells with pride every time I see a man or woman in a uniform. I want to thank from the bottom of my heart every single service man or woman, police officer, and fireman or woman. Whether it be Army, Navy, Airforce, Marines, Coast Guard or Reserves, THANK YOU for the freedom I can share each and every day. <br>
<br>
To the Bin Ladens of the world, you will never succeed in bringing America to its knees. To the countries of the world that support terrorism, you will only face the wrath of this great and mighty nation. And in doing so, WE will succeed in bringing YOU to your knees. <br>
<br>
To the President of the United States, I thank you most for having the courage and integrity to show the rest of the world what Americans are made of. May God bless you in guiding our country. <br>
<br>
Lastly, to every person that lost a loved one on 9-11 my prayers are with you now and always. You have suffered the most and have showed us the greatest courage by picking and going on with your lives. Take comfort in knowing that all of you will be in millions of peoples prayers, and that justice will find those that have rattled our cage.<br>
