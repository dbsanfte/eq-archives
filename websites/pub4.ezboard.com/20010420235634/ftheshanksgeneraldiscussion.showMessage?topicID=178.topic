Her muscles, more used to exertion, were protesting their prolonged inactive state at her desk. The casual stretch, which had started with her arms, now turned into a full body stretch as she rose from her chair and went about concentrating on each of her finely honed limbs. It helped to engage her body while her mind was doing some serious thinking.<br>
<br>
Fricka was not a born leader. Indeed if she was a born anything, she was a born rogue. Her family's, and her people's hardship had toughened both her body and her mind. The maruading abominations from the South had done their best to destroy her homeland and the Northern people. They had succeeded in destroying their crops, had sullied their bloodlines, and had decimated the organized government. But what these invaders did not know was that the Barbarians could also survive as nomads and that a new organization would arise out...of all things...the rogue underground.<br>
<br>
Fricka stood now as the current leader of this group. She had won the last Contest of Blood -- not from brute strength but from sheer cunning. And this outcome was fitting...for though the Contest was indeed a bloody battle...it was also a shrewd way to determine the next leader for the determined Horde. She stood now as the current leader of the only group who had the strength to stay true to the cry of the Ancestors. The only guild to place themselves between the abominations and the fragile rebuilding of a once great Northern land and to take the fight to the very gates of their enemies.<br>
<br>
She had thought they were alone in this public course of action. Oh, she knew their cause was often championed by individuals such as other Northerners, and by their fellow Blue Blooded human and Erudite cousins -- but she had not thought there would be another organized force that would stand against the impure races. From what the messengers had delivered today... she saw she was mistaken.<br>
<br>
Fricka took her seat behind the dark, Halas-wood desk, and continued writing.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufricka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fricka</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.thegamevine.com/~Elegant_Rogue/shanks/teenyknot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 11/4/00 6:37:16 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#a8a8a8><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufwank.showPublicProfile>fwank</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Global user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/31/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>6:00:28 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Roleplay -- Allies?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">The sage hit the fire with a puff of smoke, then flame... his hand reached to his side and grabbed the durfinite crystal, the one that was given to him before he could remember, by a shaman of great power.  That shaman had used this same crystal in a fire similar to this one long ago. . .that vision had predicted the war of the tribes that caused the current infection of the lands.  The Elder had been Fwanks spiritual guide, and he had died at the hands of the furry little ones.<br>
2 Haflings and a dwarf had stalked the Elder.  They followed him to his sacred fire in the tundra, watched has he prepared the ritual, and then waited.  23 hours later as the Elder emerged from his trance they struck, helpless, the elder shaman fell without a fight, being careless, stupid things they looted some coin, and a and some armor, and left him for dead.  At the same time far off in Norath gathering items for a mystical war hammer, fwank felt the blows dealt to the Elder, promptly he used his shamanic ways to defy the laws of time and space and appeared in Halas.  Two young shanks were carrying in the dying Elder as Fwank appeared. He ran to him. Holding his teacher, he brought fresh fallen snow to his lips.  The Elder smiled, &quot;This snow must not be poisoned it is too pure.&quot; He spoke quickly to Fwank of his visions, he had seen the 3 mutants waiting for him, he saw the emergence of the first Female leader of the Shanks, he saw a band of rouges with flaming knives, and he saw his own death.<br>
A tear formed in Fwanks eye as he thought of that sad day.  It grew heavy and rolled down his scare covered face and fell onto the crystal.  Fwank released the crystal into the fire.  He closed his eyes and began a faint chant, softly.  Rhythm and timber increased in Fwanks voice as a cord of smoke formed over the fire, twisted blue and green it waifed under Fwanks nose. . .<br>
His brain exploded, sweat drenched him, his eye rolled back in his head as he clawed at his eye patch (a present from a tangle with a gnoll as a young shaman) as he uncovered the scared socket, it glow bright red and Fwank collapses in to a trance; the future now being his to see and interpret. . .<br>
he saw himself on a journey<br>
he saw Shanks in a barbarian frenzy<br>
bloodshed of pointy eared half breeds, and blue skinned devils, he saw war, and humans fighting next to Shanks, helping them rather than ignoring them,  he saw the snows of Halas, deep and pure again, he saw the crowning of a human warrior covered in blood of his enemies, he saw the birth of an ogre with hatred in his eyes, he saw Shanks drinking ale, singing songs, and clarity in their eyes he had never known.<br>
he saw the future. . .</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#CCCCCC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Parin</FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Unregistered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/31/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>12:59:55 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">The cold.....</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I watched none to comfortably from my frozen shadowed perch.  She sat at a large wooden desk (large by his standards) and wrote at length.  He had not dared to approach close enough to see the words she spilled onto the parchment, that would be.....unwise.<br>
<br>
I had followed her through this bleak and desolate land, my interest peaked by rumors of skilled folk in this land of oafs...a rumor I doubted I would find any truth in, and yet I had to know.<br>
<br>
The trip was long, and I took it with great caution.  This &quot;lady&quot; had moves on her, that is a fact.  I had seen her fight, and for her size I must admit to myself; she is good.<br>
<br>
A few of her countrymen fell to my blade, they having accidentally stumbled upon my places of hiding...thier last mistake to be sure. A strong people out of need; for the weak could not survive this clime for long, the fights still had not even been close.<br>
<br>
She had met with what I believe to be members of her Clan, the fact that she could even write went against all I had heard of the Barbarians....investigation for pleasure had turned into a mission of great import to me.  Know thy enemy my father had always said, alas; he proved to be one of them...I shall almost miss him.<br>
<br>
I do not know what those words were that she scribed, but she did so for hours; perhaps battle plans, perhaps personal letters, perhaps a list for shopping.  The thought of passing the guards, entering the building, stealing the note, and returning through all of that raced in my mind...I let them race to thier hearts content...they would not be acted upon.<br>
<br>
Many men and women had entered where she sat now, not directly to her but definitely the same building.  All were armed, and a good portion chose the weapons I my self had or desired....this did not look like a good thing.<br>
<br>
I sat there for hours before it dawned on me that this Barbarian had captured my eye....&quot;Bah&quot; I almost actually uttered...she was weak!!  Simple to think, not so easy to believe.  I have always had a fondness for strength, especially in women; and THIS woman was both strong and oddly, facinatingly....beautiful?<br>
<br>
Bah!! I actually muttered it under my breath (a mistake to be sure, but the sounds of drunken Barbarians likely drowned out my faux pas).  I relaxed and continued to watch.<br>
<br>
Her hand moved over the paper in an odd fashion.  I puzzled this in my mind until I realized she had sent signal to her Clan.  I had been discovered...this both thrilled and disappointed me.  The signal was smooth but I had at least noticed it, it was a tip off that there were hunters coming for me. The game was afoot and I knew from the hushed tones in the building that they came in number, a good clue to have.  The slight movement out of the corner of my eye was my next clue that I had been discovered....not to mention the pain from the knife lodged in my leg.  <br>
<br>
Sure I had not been spotted directly, but that he/she who had thrown the weapon had done so at the shape he saw and not the &quot;person&quot;; I calculated my choices.  Made my decision, quaffed a potion and arrived promptly in Neriak.<br>
<br>
The bartender made as if to comment but my fist silenced him, he brought me an ale and a cloth.<br>
<br>
As I tended my minor wound, I pondered this Barbarian lady, her Clan, her homeland.  It wasn't so much a fear that I felt, nor like a dread.  With a sigh and a swig of ale I came abruptly to a conclusion.  I almost smiled as the thought struck me...another worthy adversary in Norrath........how grand life is!  A shame they won't be allowed to prosper..........<br>

Most days she would have given the signal immediately but she felt a strange undercurrent from the gaze presently upon her.  What was it?  She felt the intensity of a predator in the gaze, she was used to that, but something else ... perhaps puzzlement?  She continued writing but covertly secured the hairpin dagger in her left hand as she brushed her hair from her face.<br>
<br>
Still no movement from the watcher.  She gave the signal and waited.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
It was one of the younger Shanks who came in to report.  He did not salute and stood easy, there was usually little formality in the Horde. “The squad thinks it was a male dark elf most likely from the looks of the prints in the snow ... but I’m afraid I threw too early, he vanished without a trace -- might be a magick user”  The Shank lowered his eyes at admitting the last but raised them up again, “I drew blood though.”<br>
<br>
Fricka had raised an eyebrow at the mention of a dark elf, disturbing news indeed if one had traveled this far.  Now she smiled at the Shank’s words.  “Ye’ve done well, there will be time enough for more bloodletting.  When Thorac returns,  catch him between cups and see if he  can give ye a few stalking pointers.”  The Shank grinned at her words and departed.<br>
<br>
On the desk, the ink was drying on the letter Fricka had written.  With a dark elf within the very walls of Halas, she knew she had made the right decision.  At the upcoming Contest of Blood she would make what could be the last, and defining move of her time as Shanks leader.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#CCCCCC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Morvran</FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Unregistered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>6/5/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>8:48:03 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Allies</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">My hand still twitched with excitement as I left her room.  She had been proud, I think.  Being new to the clan I was eager to impress the leaders, but it may have been my eagerness which cost us some answers.  At the very least it cost us a body, and a dark elven one at that.<br>
<br>
I breathed in the cold, crisp northern air as I left the hut.  So clean and fresh...so different from Qeynos, my home for the past ten years.  My village had been slaughtered by marauding mountain orcs when I was but a child.  I was rescued by a Qeynos druid and left in the Abbey of Marr to be raised by the priests; but their ways were not for me.  I was a wanderer, with hatred in my heart that Erolissi herself could not cure.  I raised myself on the streets, owing to no man but myself.<br>
<br>
At fifteen I had set out to find my home country and was taken in by the Shank Clan as a scout, a position I took with honor and pride.  I could smell the glory of our forefathers in this place.  It rises with every morning and resonates through the nights.<br>

<br>
As the pain began to subside, he opened his eyes - and the pain flared fresh and harsh!<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy my son, you've had a trying time.&quot; said a calm, fatherly voice.<br>
<br>
He answered &quot;Where..how..what..?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You were brought in here more dead than alive, naked and wet.  Someone mentioned fishing you out of the River of Death in the rottin realm under Guk.  Foolish lad, whatever were you doing there?  Even if not for the ancient undead that infest the place, the whole area swarms with Trolls, Ogres and worse!  You're lucky it were another Northman that found you, otherwise the savages that dwell there might well be feasting on your eyes!  Too bad about your gear, you were brought in as I see you now - but at least you'll live.&quot;<br>
<br>
He remembered:  Following leads, reading maps, deciphering ramblings and writings.  He was searching for the artifact that would make him supreme as a scout and spy - a mask, a magical mask that would allow him to see in the dark and even assume the form of a foul Tier'Dal to better infiltrate enemy strongholds.  <br>
<br>
He'd failed.  All his gear was safe.  The 'Merchants' guild of Freeport had actually placed in the city's own vaults for safekeeping.  He'd made the journey South across the desert and through the swamps carrying just food and water enough for the trip.  He's looted a corpse in Innothule and picked up an old warhammer that he carried as though a travelling shaman.<br>
<br>
Once he's snaked his way to the bottom of old Guk, he recognized the passage from its description in an old text.  From here, he knew the way!  He'd carefully memorized the map.  He even overheard on of the Tier'Dal in the corridor describing the creature said to possess the mask!  If his ears were to be believed, this was a huge stroke of luck!  The guardian slain and the mask safe in its hiding place!<br>
<br>
He set off at the best speed he could manage and still remain safe from prying eyes.  Past Ogres, Trolls, Tier'Dal and a couple of undead frog-like creatures that resembled the residents above - but much more sinister and deadly.  He reached the end of the first hallway, took a deep breath and slipped into the foul, icy water to make the next leg of the journey - this was a shortcut detailed in one rambling account..<br>
<br>
He made it easily through the dark tunnel and crawled out of the water in what looked like an ancient bedroom.  There were several more of the undead frog creatures but he'd snuck past many already and these should present no more problems than the others.  He came to a fork and took the right and darker of the 2.  As he reach the point where they merged back together, he saw 3 huge rotting bats flying in the cavern.  They could sense him if he got too close - the left passage would take him farther from them, so he backtracked to the junction.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a howl went up and an ancient Lord of the foul place smashed stone from the walls inches from his head!  He'd been found out!  Without hesitation he leaped over the foul creature and dove headlong across the room for the relative safety of the stream - counting on the centuries having slowed his attacker enough to allow him escape.<br>
<br>
Whatever foul magicks kept the creature from turning to dust had also kept its speed and reflexes alive as well - this time the gleaming mace caught him in mid-air the way a child club catches the stone to send it far into the air!  He didn't even remember hitting the icy water - already unconscious.<br>
<br>
HE had failed.  But he knew what must be done.  Obviously, he wasn't smart enough to walk away given the chance to do so.  He would skulk about in the shadows and wait for a hardy group to clear that first area of undeath - perhaps even the vile bats as well and slip deeper into the temple to the hiding place of his treasure.<br>
<br>
Was this what they called obsession?<br>

<br>
The Contest. Fricka heard loud laughter from the room outside. Her Brothers and Sisters of the North grew progressively unruly as a Contest of Blood approached. She heard the distinctive sound of a chair toppling over and a table being shoved aside. She paused en route to the door and, sure enough, she heard Fortis’ voice calming whoever had done the toppling. This was good as, she preferred to be one of the crowd and not its disciplinarian but as current leader she would be looked on as the latter if she had burst into the hall.<br>
<br>
Fricka moved into the mead hall, instinctively seeking the shadow formed from one of the rafters. One of the Shanks, saw her anyway. “Hail!” He said and clapsed his hand round her waist. “Think ye can sneak out of the hall without a drink?” Fricka did a half turn to slide out of the grasp and took an engarde position in sixth. Her index fnger was held in a point in line where a rapier’s blade would be, but all she wielded now was a bright smile. She lunged and caught the Shank on the left side of his well muscled chest. “Getting sloppy Wotan” she teased. “Best ye watch yourself or others might catch ye.” Wotan grinned.<br>
<br>
“Aye, and it might be me at the Contest,” Fortis said. Wotan turned back to the rough hewn table from which he had come from and was caught up again in the talk.<br>
<br>
The Contest. Fricka’s stomach gave a little turn as she proceeded outside to the Halas snow. With so many Shanks away in Freeport and a scout team exploring the fabled new continent of Kunark, she had thought the Contest would perhaps be delayed. But the Shamen had decreed it time, and full attendance or not there would be another Contest of Blood. It was time for a toughening of the Horde, a distribution of honors and the emergence of a leader.</font><P><img src="http://www.thegamevine.com/~Elegant_Rogue/shanks/fricka.gif"><br><font color=990033><b>Fricka</b><br>

<br>
Fricka stood quivering.  She saw the Arena, the ground<br>
red with blood, the rough stone walls, and a blue<br>
pennant hanging from a pole.  She saw that where<br>
before there had been many Shanks, now there were only<br>
three.<br>
<br>
Sound rushed back to her with an accompanying cold<br>
wind.  It was always thus when the gods would replace<br>
her unto the world.<br>
<br>
Metal blade rang on metal shield and Ziandra whirled<br>
by, her blades flashing.  Pale blue light crackled in<br>
Nerasow’s hands.  Fricka caught a movement from the<br>
corner of her eye.  She sprung to her left, landing in<br>
a crouch, her blade poised for a counterattck to<br>
answer Fwank’s thrust.<br>
<br>
Her blood cried to strike.  This was the Contest. <br>
This was the moment when all Shanks were all but<br>
besides themselves with blood lust and the heat of<br>
competition.  She did not strike, but quickly<br>
retreated, stamped her trailing  foot and raised her<br>
left hand to give the signal that she was out of the<br>
Contest.  It stung to do so but Fricka knew this was<br>
the right thing to do.  Shanks law decreed that if one<br>
were to leave the Arena, they would be forfeit in the<br>
Contest.   And though she did not understand why the<br>
Ancestors had called her away in the middle of<br>
competition, she knew that she had left as surely as<br>
if she had stepped on to the spectator flag stones.<br>
<br>
After Fricka’s evasion Fwank had turned his attention<br>
to the others and the sound of steel on steel rung<br>
through the arena.<br>
<br>
Fricka sunk now to a spectator stone, a Shaman began<br>
to administer her wounds as she watched the Contest. <br>
Fwank, Ziandra and Nerasow remained, one would arise<br>
to replace her as leader.  This did not sadden Fricka<br>
but a small frown flitted across her face.  She<br>
thought of the letter she had written, she had felt<br>
certain that Fwank would be the one to deliver it.  <br>
Fricka looked upon the Arena floor.<br>
<br>
Ziandra landed awkwardly after narrowly missing a<br>
thrust from Fwank’s spear.  A small gasp escaped from<br>
the crowd as those assembled recognized it as a sign<br>
that  the length of the battle was wearying her. <br>
Fwank and Nerasow recognized the sign as well and<br>
pressed her.  She gave ground before them, parrying<br>
deftly but failing to land her ripostes.  Soon she<br>
gave the signal that she too was out of the Contest.<br>
<br>
All eyes turned now to the remaining Shanks, who had<br>
not paused at the cheer that arose to congratulate<br>
Ziandra on a fight well fought, but had continued<br>
their attacks, intent on each other.<br>
<br>
Fricka felt a sharp pain in her shoulder.  The<br>
attending Shaman had pressed too deep with his<br>
poultice.<br>
<br>
She looked up again and saw Nerasow kneeling before<br>
Fwank as the latter struck him blow, after blow.  How<br>
could this be?  Nerasow had been in fine health!  He<br>
was speaking to the crowd but Fricka did not hear the<br>
words as Shanks and spectators erupted in shouts and<br>
pounded shields to recognize the new leader.<br>
<br>
“All Hail Fwank!”<br>
<br>
Fricka joined in with the shouts.  What did the gods have in mind now?  She thought once of the letter sitting in the back room of the mead hall.  She thought Fwank was the one to deliver it but how could he leave Halas now that he was leader?</font><P><img src="http://www.thegamevine.com/~Elegant_Rogue/shanks/fricka.gif"><br><font color=990033><b>Fricka</b><br>

Her plans would not go to waste.  The venerable Nerasow, though previously of waning health was to be Horde leader and Fwank would indeed go on to Highpass as his vision decreed.  Allies were what the Shanks needed now.<br>
<br>
A smile twitched at the corner of Fricka's mouth, temporarily creasing her flawless skin.  She was not in war paint now and the effect was one which had oft bewitched an on looker.<br>
<br>
A chance glance from the board and out the window caused her to seek the mead hall shadows.  Strangers were coming.  She would be prudent and hide.  And then time for some ale afterwards perhaps.<br>

He must send a message to Bertoxxulous on completing his long journey to the north, in hopes of achieving an allegiance with the barbaric tribe known as the Shanks.  <br>
<br>
He walks up to the table, unsheathes his dagger, and begins to etch words mixed with symbols (that only Bertoxxulous followers have any hopes of understanding) into his parchment.<br>
<br>
In long eccentric strokes, he mentions how the barbarians where even stronger then he had hoped for.  They are indeed a worthy group in which he hopes to fight along side with.  He also describes how cold, and chilling the air was to breathe in the snow covered mountains.  Like tiny needles poking holes into your lunges, an almost unbearable pleasure at most.  <br>
<br>
Every now and then, Zaxan would wet the tip of his dagger with his tongue, then continue to etch his letter.  Catching any ink that would run off the sides of his message with some cloth hanging beside the table.  <br>
<br>
After a good while of careful etching and penmanship, he ends his letter with this closing.  <br>
<br>
“The day of the Plague is drawing closer, soon we will make a second journey to the snowy mountains.  In hopes of returning with new brothers.”<br>
<br>
Zaxan stands, cleans the red ink off the tip of his dagger, and places it back in its hilt.  Taking the cloth, which he has been using to catch the runs, he dips it into some water in a bucket nearby, and gently rubs the elf’s forehead, cleaning the sweat off his brow.  <br>
<br>
“You indeed are a lucky one my little messenger.  For when you finally get in touch with Bertoxxulous, make mention of the message I have carved on your chest.”<br>
<br>
Turning away, he leaves the elf.  Chained on the table, silenced with fear, eyes dilated from shock, and trembling in pleasure.      <br>

<br>
A moisture laden breeze moved across the North Karana plains. The wind whipped Fricka’s hair into twisting banners of gold and she breathed deeply to take in the welcome coolness. She wore the green travel leathers a guild seamstress had made for her. Patterned in green and the natural brown of the leather, they helped her blend in with the local foliage but did not appear out of the ordinary in a crowd. She really should tie her hair but it felt good to feel the wind playing with its strands. Fricka avoided the highway and carefully chose her steps through the high grasses of the North Karana plains.<br>
<br>
Travel. Fricka loved to travel. As long as she had Halas to come home to she was more than content to roam all of Norrath. And travel she had, she had scouted over much of Norrath even unto lands claimed by the abominations. While she loved the land and the travel it was the people who saddened her. Abominations roamed in increasingly large areas and she even saw weak human and erudite cousins parlaying with the enemy. It was her Brothers and Sisters of the North who saddened her the most however. Their Ancestors must be writhing in agony to know that their voices were not being heard.<br>
<br>
“Leave it there to rot. It is too small.”<br>
<br>
Fricka heard the voice faintly from her right. In two quiet strides Fricka concealed herself behind a low topped plains tree. Whoever it was spoke the tongue of the taller pale skinned pointy eared. The sentiment expressed supported this theory, none of her kind would be so foolish as to hunt so wastefully. With one hand, Fricka caught her hair and tied it back with a thin piece of leather, her other hand held aside a tree branch and she peered upon the plains.<br>
<br>
There were two of them off in the distance. Fricka could tell right away that the pointy ears were on what they called a “hunting safari”.  She had heard that the pointy eared ones later put the heads of the animals on the wall instead of using them for head coverings.  Fricka replaced the displaced leaves and checked her supply of shurikens.  Her mission was to scout but she doubted anyone would miss these two.  Loosening her blood claw, she began to stalk her prey.  The pointy ears were foolishly still standing around their kill, a frail lion whose blood Fricka could smell on the wind as she moved towards the pointy eared. The smell would start attracting other predators.<br>
<br>
Fricka moved deliberately towards the elves, her eyes never leaving her targets.  The wind moved the tall grasses between her and her prey, she shifted with the movement, letting the blades slide across her bare legs and back into place.  She was almost close enough.<br>
<br>
There was no warning.  A swoop of wings and one of the elves cried out in pain.  The griffon carried its dinner westward.  The remaining elf took off running, towards the road to Highpass Hold.  Fricka had frozen in place, the griffon would not be back.  She began her retreat to the tree where she had left her knapsack.<br>
<br>
The elf had taken off to Highpass.  That had already been her destination.  Now it would be more interesting.  Fricka checked her belongings for the other items the guild tailors had made for her.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufricka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fricka</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.thegamevine.com/~Elegant_Rogue/shanks/teenyknot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 7/19/00 7:24:19 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#a8a8a8><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/btheshanks.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thorac>Thorac</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Local user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>6/13/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>7:51:47 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Roleplay -- Allies?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Fixer was shopping.  Chatting with the vendors and merchants near the Collegium Magi was always interesting and sometimes even informative.<br>
<br>
As he was contemplating a spell to summon a lightsource since he'd been doing a lot of travelling at night when a voice in the language of mages whispered in his mind 'come to the docks...'.  Having just traded spell-for-spell with a travelling druid, Fixer was still as fast as a wolf and he sprinted through the narrow streets to the wharf.<br>
<br>
Once there, he met a smiling, older Erudite like himself.  The older man was pleased that someone had heard and answered his summons and gave Fixer a rolled-up scroll.  Fixer unrolled and scanned the text and his eyes widened slightly as he realized he'd just been given the formula to a spell he wouldn't be able to fully understand for quite some time..<br>
<br>
The Elder Erudite then began to quiz Fixer on his recent travels, hunts and (mis)adventures.  Satisfied with the answers, apparently, the elder asked if Fixer paid allegiance to any guild or union.  Fixer, of course, had always been strictly freelance - even though his sympathies lied with the Shanks.  The elder began describing his own affiliation with a group known as The Council of Thievery.  Primarily robed casters of various disciplines recruiting new members.<br>
<br>
Fixer then began to quiz the elder on the guild's stance on lesser races and defense of the Western Lands.  He even dropped referance to his affiliation with the Shanks and their 'extremist' views.  The elder felt that this was no problem since the guild regularly cleared out any Drow, Troll, Ogre or short race they came across - unless they were known to be 'good'.  The elder, further, didn't think Fixer's association with the Shanks would upset the elves in the guild over much.<br>
<br>
Fixer had heard enough.  Glancing over the elder's shoulder, he asked &quot;Isn't that your ship?&quot;  As the elder, predictably, looked back towards the water, Fixer triggered his emergency transport spell.  Once safely in the Bank - the most secure place Fixer knew of (particularly with the 'rent' he paid the owners for his infrequent drop-ins) he had Sorn put the scroll into a safe place for later perusal.<br>
<br>
Why hadn't the senile old bugger asked Fixer whether associating with elves in a guild would bother HIM?<br>
<br>
Fixer of Vallon<br>
You need something?  You come see the Fixer - he'll fix you right up!<br>

On an elegant wooden desk a number of parchment scrolls lay scattered. Suddenly, one of the shadows in the corner of the room was pierced from within by a swordtip. The blade ripped downwards, and a leather-clad Erudite lady stepped through the rift.<br>
&quot;Finally, home&quot;, she sighed. &quot;Now we shall begin again&quot;.<br>
<br>
She moved to the desk, pulled back a chair trimmed in what appeared to be leather at first glance, and picked up a quill. She dipped the nib into a bottle of red liquid, and began to write on some parchment.<br>
<br>
After a while, the scratching of the nib stopped, and she stood up. She rolled the scroll up, humming to herself. Softly chanting something under her breath, she stepped into the shadows &amp; disappeared.<br>
<br>
A while later, down by the entrance to Paineel by the great lift, something fluttered on the wall like a dying bird. It was a scroll, written in brownish-red ink. It read:<br>
<br>
&quot;We who were once know as the Paineel Crusaders have returned. Through the treachery of infidels, the Crusaders were rendered unto dust. However, we shall not bow down before the inequities of fate, but stand proud, reborn as the Templars of Paineel.<br>

She sat in the back of the Lions Mane Inn, rumaging through her bags, trying to look busy. Her invisable companion sat beside her, the sound of steel on stone rasping from him. She chuckled, he was always preparing for the time he knew would come, that time was soon.<br>
<br>
"Well thank you," the elf said in a happy tone," I will be sure to look into this Blackburrow." <br>
<br>
     Guard Lantin, the young fool, nodded his head towards her. "Your help will be appreciated by all in Qeynos.And remember Captain Tilins request as well." He was obviously swooned by this one, he always was by these pointy ears. He scowled at Cassianna as he left, she returned his gaze with a warm smile.<br>
<br>
     When the door finished closing she turned her eyes to the creature at the table. She was small and fair faced, her skin a tan and her garb was that of the woodland elves. Her leathers she wore very tight, almost to tight, she was a whore who was looking for work. Obviously she though someone here would not hurt her, and she was totally safe. She was so confident she had left her weapon and shield at the door, what a fool.<br>
<br>
     Cassianna looked to her companion and slowly nodded, she felt him mentally answer her in the affirmative. She watched the shield walk towards the young elf, and heard the rasp of steel as Xantik pulled his blade. The young elf looked up, confused, at the sight before her, just as Xantik kicked the chair out from under her. Cassianna's mind raced through ancient words of power memorized over the days. She chanted in the arcane tongue and the red wisps of magic gathered around her hands. <br>
<br>
    The young elf screamed as the spell coompleted, and red strings of magic wrapped around her neck, squeezing. Xantik slammed his shield againsst her fair elven face, and she stumbled to the floor as it landed with a audible clang. Quickly cassianna moved to the elfs side, and raised her staff above her head. It came down with a sharp crack, more the elfs neck then the wood of her fine weapon. <br>
<br>
     Xantik stepped back, and with a quite chuckle, he sat down again in his chair. Cassianna giggled, the adrenaline slowly leaving her, as she reached for the elfs money pouch. This one had been doing quite a bit of hard work, to bad she wouldnt be spending it now. The bartender smiled to her, and nodded, she understood. Cassianna nodded in return, as she walked back over to her chair. A fresh mug of Blackburrow stout was brought for her help and her trouble. She nodded to the maid, and raised the glass, cleaning house was such thirsty work.</font><P><center><IMG SRC = http://www.geocities.com/snugglelove_69_21/ankhspinning.gif></center>

Removing her boots, Fricka slipped on a pair of special shoes and laced them tightly.<br>
<br>
She surveyed the Highpass cliff and the distance she had to go to reach the top.  The elven hunters would be coming up the path.  But Fricka planned on a direct route.<br>
<br>
Her eye found a crack in the granite face.  It led half way up the cliff where a small tree grew out of it.  She thought she could see the barest of ledges there traveling to the right to another crack system.  She could not tell if this one reached the top, but the rock looked not as smooth there.  It was the best route from the looks of it.<br>
<br>
Fricka made a fist with her hand and placed it in the rock crevice.  She set her foot into the crack and began her ascent.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#a8a8a8><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umajestykvz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MajestykVZ</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Council of Elders</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>1/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>10:06:38 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Roleplay -- Allies?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Majestyk takes a seat at the base of the cliff and leans back against a rock.

<br>
&quot;Bah, doesn't look so bad from here&quot; grumbled the tall barbarian, gazing across the serene face of the lake that, according to local legend, was said to house treasure beyond a man's wildest dreams, if you would believe the locals that is.<br>
<br>
As that cool wind, which could have very well been born in the frozen northlands that the barbarian called home, reached him, he closed his eyes and relished the cool caress of the wind, rare as it was in this tropical cesspool that he had so recently traveled too.  <br>
<br>
The tales of easy wealth ready to be taken from those to weak to hold it for themselves had reached the farthest corners of his homeland in the frozen peaks at the northern-most point on the continent of Antontica.  And so he had come, eager for quick riches, exotic women, and some good beer.  But unfortunatly fate had something else in store for the young northman, he had seen nothing but trees, mud, and swamp so far in his journey south, the local females were anything if exotic, a race of intelligent lizards that passed for the sentient race on this godsforsaken rock, and the beer ran out months ago while traveling through the swamps and jungles that seemed to dominate this land.<br>
<br>
The barbarian sighed as he looked into the flask that contained the last of his reserve stock of Ol' Tujims Fierce Brew, generously supplied by the guild brewer at their most recent gathering.  He shuddered at the prospect of living off of nothing but food and water that seemed to loom ever larger in his future.  &quot;Bah,&quot; he thought &quot;This is definatly not a place I'd like to face stone sober.&quot;<br>
<br>
Letting go of another hefty sigh the young barbarian shouldered his gear and began making his way down the coastline of the lake.  &quot;the sacrifices I make to get ahold of a few honest plat's....&quot;  he said to no one in particular as he stumped along the edge of the lake...<br>
