I figure there's a jury which will be hearing a lot of evidence (&quot;evidence&quot; -- that stuff we use to make decisions in this country) on that question.<br>
<br>
From the very beginning I've had questions about this case.  After the birth of her fourth child Yates had post-partum depression so severe she tried to kill herself twice, and was warned by a doctor against having more kids.  So, one might wonder, what the hell was up with having the fifth child?  I have a feeling that's where the husband's support of her might come from -- guilt?<br>
<br>
After her fifth child, she not only had post-partum depression, she had post-partum psychosis (extremely rare, and far more serious than &quot;mere depression&quot;) and she sought mental health treatment for it -- but it appears she didn't receive appropriate treatment (there have been some news articles about what treatment she did receive, and I think there's an investigation of the psychiatrist who treated her).<br>
<br>
I'm not saying I have any sympathy whatsoever for her act of killing her children -- this was a horrible crime, and the jury will decide whether she's legally responsible for it -- but I really have to wonder about a situation where a woman whose problem was triggered by having children continued to have children, and who literally begged for help for her condition and didn't receive it.  This was a sad situation for years before it turned tragic.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanalornesongheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Analorne Songheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 9:47:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Public Hangings?</span><hr size=1> Arikel said:<br>

<br>
Arikel, the point of my post was not that I knew how to sentence her.  It was simply that I was totally and completely sickened by the fact that <br>
       A.) She is only being charged with 2 counts of capital murder<br>
    and <br>
       B.) Her plea is &quot;Not guilty by reason of insanity&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I think she's insane.  You'd have to be to do something so horrible.  BUT, I do not believe for one moment that she should be set free because of it.  <br>
<br>
As for not knowing jack shit...I have 3 kids.  I am also a nursing student.  I damn well know what this lady did was wrong.  There is no grey area.  Yes, this is only my opinion and I won't be in that courtroom to ultimately decide her fate.  <br>
<br>
I can damn sure rant about it, though.  I'm a mother.  The very idea of watching one of my children squirm face down in a bathtub while drowning at the hands of someone they love and trust makes me physically ill.  It makes me angry.  It makes me want to wake my children up at midnight just to tell them I love them.  <br>
<br>
I didn't come here to say I knew any better than the professionals and jury that will ultimately control what happens.  I simply came here to give my opinion.  <br>
<br>
There were a lot of steps she could have taken to avoid this.  If she was that on the edge, why didn't her husband call someone?  Perhaps it wasn't convenient.  Whatever the case, there is a lot of evidence that this was pre-meditated, according to the newspapers.  Media can twist things, so we will only know when it's over.  <br>
<br>
Again, the whole point of this post was to get it off my chest that just hearing this hurt me to the depth of my heart and soul.  It made me want to throw up.  It made me cry.  <br>
<br>
The only plea I could see is if she were medically determined to be mentally retarded.  (I do not mean that as an insult)  However, the fact that she made it through nursing school (Some seriously tough shit, there) shows that she was an intelligent woman.  She did wrong.  She knew it was wrong.  She's sick, twisted and deserves to be tortured, not pittied, for her acts.<br>

And he was 7 I believe.  The 7 year old walked in on her killing the second oldest child and proceeded to try to run away from his mother.  And she methodically stalked him through the house, with him begging and screaming for her to please not hurt him.  Then when she caught him she dragged him, still pleading for his own mother not to hurt him, to the bathtub and drowned him.<br>
<br>
Crazy or not, the bitch had no mercy.  And I don't feel that death is good enough for her.  I agree with the above post that we should torture her for the next 30 years.  And then let her slowly be eaten alive by a million red ants or something at the end of it.<br>

I think ALL of us know about &quot;this sort of thing&quot; and know that it is WRONG and something that should be punished for.  Are you going to try and tell us all that we don't know anything about how it's wrong to murder your children, whether you're insane or not??  Hello!  It's not something you really need to be educated on.  <br>
<br>
I don't have kids of my own...but I do have quite a few younger siblings that I've helped raise, and I couldn't even imagine anything they could possibly do (and they can be pretty awful) that would even justify something as severe as leaving a bruise on them.  And I can god-damn guarantee that if anyone did raise a hand against them I would unleash hell upon them.  I couldn't imagine if someone had killed them.  Even just mentioning it now makes bile rise up in my throat.  So, before I get sick, I'm gonna end this now. <p><center><img src="http://www.geocities.com/kevinschic/Dhar3_frosty.txt"><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/trueallegiance"><font face=verdana><b>True Allegiance</b></font></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uasythanax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asythanax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 11:14:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Public Hangings?</span><hr size=1> OK here is a nice alternative punishment to death....<br>

Lock her in one of those SuperMax prisons, in a single occupancy cell. On the wall across from her bunk put pictures of her kids on the wall behind some Plexiglas and let her look at that all day long for the rest of her unnatural life.  Insane or not, that would be an appropriate punishment. <br>

My opinion:<br>
If you have not experienced first hand what chronic mental illness does to a human being, you are talking out both sides of your mouth.<br>
It's the most frightening thing of all things we may experience, to walk in the shadows of the human mind. <br>
A darker place, we hold within, darker than the darkest stuff any writer of fiction can conjure.<br>

This is my philosophy in action.  If you don't want to hear about someone against the death penalty, then please skip to next post. It's all opinion anyway.<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
For those still here, I do not believe this mother should be executed.  The proponents for capital punishment are, to me at least, nicely summed up by:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
If my spouse killed my children we wouldn't have to worry about insanity pleas, capitol punishment, or anything else. I'd fucking kill that person so fast they wouldn't know what hit them. I certainly wouldn't be giving excuses for this person.<br>
<br>
I don't care how depressed you are. Killing someone else isn't an option.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See the inherent contradiction here?  This author (and I chose this one only because of how it was laid out, the same basic argument is being used by every proponent of capital punishment) in one post says they would kill the wife and in the very next paragraph say killing someone isn’t an option.<br>
<br>
This is my basis for condoning the death penalty.  The reason we are so outraged at this action is because it involves a person choosing to kill another.  We find that unacceptable.  But we are to find it acceptable as a form of punishment.  Why??<br>
<br>
Because we out number them?  Might makes right?  Does that mean the deaths of blacks in the south by the white majority were acceptable.  I mean, white outnumbered black through many periods of colonial and American history.<br>
<br>
Because it is legally supported?  Barely.  Turkey is the only country in Europe to have a death sentence.  It’s not even allowed across the United States, but chosen on a state by state basis.  I don’t believe Canada has a death penalty.  Besides, even if it is legal, law does not mean it is right.  Again, slavery was legal in the U.S. for many years.  Or lets look at the legal exterimation of people in Nazi Germany.  Laws tell what is, not what should be.<br>
<br>
Don’t get me wrong.  I am horrified and offended by this woman’s actions as much as any of you.  It is BECAUSE I am horrified and offended by her actions that I refuse to stand with those who say we should do her crime back to her.  Likewise, I think not guilty by reason of insanity is a cop out.  Regardless if she meant to do it or not, she committed a crime against humanity.  We, as a society, have the responsibility to protect ourselves.  In this case, I think protecting ourselves would be served by forced sterilization of the woman to ensure she had no further children, banning her from any kind of care giver role, and probably life term imprisonment anyway.<br>
<br>
However, to lower ourselves to her level, is insanity too.  How can we preach murder is wrong and condone it at the same time when we are the ones doing it?<br>
<br>
As far as the practical issues of capital punishment, such as the money issue:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> *Housing, Feeding, Cleaning, Medical Check-ups, Prescriptions when their sick, etc etc for 20-30 years <br>

Don’t forget to add:<br>
*Separate special circumstances trial for capital punishment sentence.<br>
*Guaranteed appeal.<br>
<br>
Court time is expensive!  Last time I researched this issue (which, granted, was 1984, and this may no longer be relevant) because of the trial requirements, capital punishment cost as much as a 32.5 year stay in a medium security prison.  <br>
<br>
Also I would love to see some statistics that support the deterrent effect of capital punishment.  In the same 1984 period I could find NO evidence to support that contention.  Murder is usually done in hot blood/instability when getting caught doesn’t occur, or cold blooded in a very precise manner which takes into consideration how to avoid getting caught.  In both cases, the impact of possible punishment is negligent and therefore does nothing to avert the crime.<br>
<br>
Does this mean I am 100% against killing people?  No, actually, I am not.  I believe in justified murder (and lets not kid ourselves, that is what it is) in cases of self-defense.  Period.  Full stop.  If you or your family is at gun point and your only way to protect them is to kill the perpetrator, go for it with my best wishes.  If there is a serial killer who will kill again, who can escape confinement, and is even killing people in prison…then it is self-defense to murder him as well.<br>
<br>
But it is not self-defense to kill this woman.  It will not deter others from committing the same crime.  Other steps can be done to prevent her from harming others.  To kill her is revenge.  Revenge is a very powerful feeling, I understand that.  But I don’t think it is one we should espouse in the concept of protection or justice.  It is neither.  It is a crime.<br>
<br>
Now, if you want to say revenge is fine, that we can kill whom we chose for whatever criteria we decide, cool.  That’s an opinion.  And I’m glad to the Goddess that you only know me by a fantasy pseudonym. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm quite aware that killing people is wrong.  I'm a fucking student of ethics, I'm pursuing a degree in it.  What I meant was that you guys know jack and shit about mental illness.  I'm much more comfortable leaving judgement on this woman's ability to distinguish right from wrong to people who know something about her condition, rather than people who think they can pass this sort of judgement based upon a newspaper article or hearsay on the Internet.

Crazy people do exist, whether you lack the mental capabilities to even ponder a different mindset from your own does not change this simple fact. <br>
<br>
When Ronald Reagan was Governor of our State, he too didn't believe in 'insanity'. These people 'chose' their condition as far as he was concerned. He promptly cut off the state budget for 'nut houses', gave em all checks for a few months rent, and loosed them upon our streets where many still wander to this day. You see em, talking to trees etc. Really kinda sad. Now he is a muttering insane vegetable not fit to go out in public. Gotta love the irony there.<br>
<br>
Anyways, she was clearly diagnosed before it happened. Too bad noone took the diagnosis seriously. Guess her family didn't believe in 'insanity' either. Poor kids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanalornesongheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Analorne Songheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 1:53:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well made points..</span><hr size=1> There have been a few people that have made some good points.  Arikel and Raelven brought up how severe mental illness can be.  <br>
<br>
You're right, it can be beyond the scope of understanding of someone who does not suffer it.  I've witnessed it, firsthand, though.  I had a very good friend with a mother so insane that at her peak &quot;manic&quot; times she went into her church and started destroying everything in sight and managed to fight off 5 police officers before they got her subdued and at the lowest low, she would lay in bed and soil herself for weeks on end.  We had to clean it up, we had to force feed her.  <br>
<br>
I can only imagine what was going on inside her head.<br>
<br>
So this leads to another question...If she was diagnosed with these illnesses....and the one where she was advised not to have any more children...why didn't they tie her tubes?  Why weren't her children placed somewhere safe if she had proven to be a &quot;danger to herself or others&quot;...<br>
<br>
Ultimately, she is the one responsible for her actions.  However, could this not have been prevented?<br>
<br>
My initial post of public hangings was simply a reflection of how I was feeling.  It was more of a metaphor than anything.  Yes, it's against the constitution for cruel and unusual punishment...But I still think that a few years in a nice mental institution is no punishment.  She's allowed to get treatment...what about her kid's rights?  Were they given the option to go somewhere safe?<br>
<br>
Simply giving her the death penalty is giving her the easy way out.  <br>
<br>
I'm angry.  I'm hurt for those kids.  I'm hurt that another parent could possibly do this.  It's not just this case.  Everytime I hear about these cases where a parent &quot;forgot&quot; their child in a car and got away with it, it makes me ill.  (See various posts on the subject on Tweety's Nest of Freaks).<br>
<br>
As a parent and someone who aspires to work in the NICU, I just can't imagine harming a family member in such a vile way.  My mother makes me want to do some crazy things, my brother is out of his mind....Much as I'd sometimes like to see them just poof out of existance, I know that murder is wrong.  I believe Andrea Yates did, too.  <br>

To think of what her babies thought as they gasped the last time for air and got water. Arms up, kicking and confused.<br>
I had post-pardum with my last child but not to this extreme. I told my doctor right away and she helped me with medication and therapy. She told someone and they attempted to help her.<br>
It was discussed on CNN after an interview with her husband that she also called him and told him to come right home. He knew the history of his own wife's mental illness. She knew what she was about to do. Why did they not seek a more intensive form of help for her ?<br>
<br>
CNN : "Attorneys for Andrea Yates, 37, are arguing an insanity defense, while prosecutors say she knew what she was doing last June 20 when she drowned her five children in the family bathtub and called for an ambulance. She also called her husband at work, told him something was wrong with the children and asked him to come home. "<br>
<br>
I understand she was dealing with something so overwhelming in her life but she should have killed herself ... not her beautiful babies. Hopefully the court system will do that for us, for her 5 children.<br>
 Every time I see the pictures of them all standing there smiling my heart cries for them. <p><allign=center>

Your comments about how your kids or your relatives make you angry sometimes is irrelevant, it just has nothing to do with the situation.  Psychosis drives people to do things that they'd be horrified by when they're in their right minds.  I have no idea why she wasn't dealt with differently when she was first diagnosed.  There could be any number of reasons, not the least of which might be that people don't take mental illness seriously enough these days.  Psychosis not about being really fucking sad or angry, those are things that normal and healthy people feel.  What happened with Yates was not normal or healthy, and if you can't relate to it that shouldn't surprise you. <p>Erevan MacQuaide, cleric of Nimue <BR>

No, I personally can't &quot;put myself in her shoes&quot;...but I can damn sure stand up and say that because of her...whatever the reason, 5 kids are now dead.  <br>

<br>
She previously admitted there was something wrong with her.  The proper actions were not taken.  So, that leads me to believe if she had been responsible enough to get MORE help when she needed it, she would not have done this.  <br>
<br>
What, then, is the difference between me eating a sheet of acid and her knowing she had a problem and not taking the proper steps before she commited murder?  <br>
<br>
If I take LSD, I am causing myself to go insane.  She refused to get help.  I fail to see the difference.<br>

I still think it's completely irrelevent as to what her punishment should be however.  And I personally can not fathom how someone could willingly do that, whether in the grip of insanity or not.  It's just not something my mind can grasp and understand.  I think that adds to a person's anger and outrage at this, that subconscious frustration.  <br>

Why am I against the death penalty?  We make mistakes.  It's tons more expensive to kill someone than put them in jail for 100 years (due to the partially effective means we have to try and prevent mistakes).  Jail is a lot harsher than death if you don't believe in an afterlife.  And I have other reasons for those of us that do.<br>
<br>
She ain't gonna get off Scot-free.  Even if she was found not guilty by reason of insanity, that doesn't send her home.  She goes to an asylum.  Remember, this is Texas folks.  Do you really think Bush's former home is gonna be that forgiving of a crazy person?<br>
<br>
Diluted:  Seek counselling for this anger you have against the Catholic Church.  It's not healthy.  Heck, you could substitute CC for Da'Kor in a Chiteng post and it'd sound like yours.  I agree that there is much to chastize the church for (and NO, I haven't been catholic for over 20 years) and they are overly committed to their concept of confession (the conviction that God has forgiven someone does not translate into the State forgiving the offender), but the church is not the source of all badness.<br>
