<br>
<br>
We were holding the camp but having a little trouble...no chanter, clarity, etc(using the necro for crowd control)<br>
<br>
A group of 3 then started pulling mobs from our camp, and pulled a couple adds onto us in the middle of a fight. The group was Popplo, Baxtin, Xannag. They were all /anon.<br>
<br>
I was rather perturbed about this so we finished off our mob and the adds they dragged onto us. We were getting behind on spawns and adds were going to start piling up soon so I went ahead and pulled the Captain PH. I assumed since none of these guys were KOS that I would be able to pull the PH through them with no problems...and to tell you the truth I wasn't terribly concerned for the safety of a group that just barreled thru our camp and pulled adds on us a moment before. <br>
<br>
As I was pulling the mob to our camp...one of the mobs they were fighting nuked me for 600 and killed me. The mobs I was pulling then aggroed back on them and killed their shammy.<br>
<br>
To be honest I didn't give a crap that one of them died because they were rude enough to just waltz through our camp and start pulling our mobs and aggroing others onto us. So yea...at the time Popplo came and started talking Dirty Harry to me I was heated(please bear that in mind because yea I said some rude things but they earned it IMO).<br>
<br>
Geneiveve got some screenshots of the ensuing confrontation:<br>

<br>
His first attempt at training us failed(he pulled it to the zone out and we had moved to the right of the guardstation):<br>
<br>
http://www.netwalk.com/~loki/popplo4.jpg<br>
<br>
Again, a little later:<br>
<br>
http://www.netwalk.com/~loki/popplo5.jpg<br>
<br>
This one he managed to pull some high level Sarnaks onto us. We were ready for it so Gene and Logic gated. Umbrae tried to FD but it was broken by AoE and she died. I FD'd and lived. <br>
<br>
Needless to say, we petitioned and /reported and a GM came too late.<br>
<br>
Umbrae sent tells to Dabiggun of Midnight Fury(Popplo's guild)...Dabiggun's response was:<br>
<br>
"Train him back"<br>
<br>
A witness had this to say:<br>
<br>
[Fri Apr 26 06:20:00 2002] Speedi tells you, 'just act like he is not bothering you, like I did and he will go away, just like any trouble maker'<br>
<br>
I am not saying that I was entirely justified in telling him "@#%$ happens"...but he shouldn't have been moving through our camp to begin with.  When people piss me off I will tell them to f uck off...it's the way I am, sue me.  <br>
<br>
However...Popplo's intentionally training us was WAY over the line.  If I am guilty of anything it is badly judging the aggro on a mob.  /shrug<br>
<br>
One inaccuracy I found in Umbrae's post was that she felt we were still moving down to the camp and they moved past us...when in fact, we had already broken the camp and were set up in it.  All mobs in the camp were down except the one we were fighting and the PH itself.<br>
<br>
I really didn't want to bring this here but apparently it wound up here anyway.  Believe what you want about my intentions....the proof of Popplo's is right there in the screenshot.<br>

I mean, you have to admit it was kinda funny, all that work running arround hitting things (since he is non KoS he had to hit alot of em) and then going the wrong way <br>
thier was not much I found enjoyable about that night, but that moment certanly was one.  that and the conversation over weather or not we should tell him he missed. but deciding he would figure it out when he zoned back in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
