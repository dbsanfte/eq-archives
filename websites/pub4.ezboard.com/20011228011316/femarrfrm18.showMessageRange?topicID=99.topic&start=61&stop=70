Any nation that harbors terrorism - be it through funding, sanctuary, policital backing, and even feigned ignorance - should consider themselves warned.<br>
<br>
It is purely within the power of those countries to oust these terrorists.<br>
<br>
For too long we, as a nation, have ignored these terrorists.<br>
<br>
2 embassies<br>
countless hijacked planes<br>
a Marine barracks<br>
now the WTC & Pentagon<br>
... and many others<br>
<br>
The "innocents" of those countries have had plenty of time to turn over their black sheep... instead they go on and protect these villains by a range of apathy, fanatic support, and fearful resignation.<br>
<br>
I am not an innocent when it comes to capitalism and the actions of the American "empire".  I know capitalism is the source of resentment & hatred aimed at the US.  I fully realize this... and though I may have qualms with it's particulars I believe it is a good way of life.<br>
<br>
"Innocent" is a term too often used in today's global society.  I am an active and participating member of my society, a society that spreads capitalism & consumerism much like a military arm.  I am as much to blame for this as the companies and entities that carry it out - for I, collectively, have the power to change things.  If not that, then I have the power to leave.<br>
<br>
You are tainted by the company you keep.<br>
<br>
Stamping out terrorism will be difficult if not impossible... but breaking the back of the support structures (governments, religious sects, private financeers, etc) should be a priority for our government.<br>

I listened to the 'context' of your words, not just the words themself.  It was crystal clear to me and everyone else in the zone (whose comments to you i did not post but would show how people felt) that you were saying you did not give a crap about the people who had died or how it affected the USA.<br>
<br>
You can wriggle and swear and post all you want but i posted exactly what you said and i conveyed the context in which you said it.<br>
<br>
I spent most of yesterday crying for my friends in NY and the USA and I dont and wont deal with a POS like you making fun of them.<br>
<br>
I wish bad things for you Affro.<br>

I won't argue with this I will just do a who all in EC the next busy day I am on which will be this Saturday.  Since you use the word ALWAYS, it should be 100+ on EVERY busy day, correct???<br>
<br>

mmmkay, something tells me that 150 of them would be LD from the lag.<br>

You're correct.  I asked for your side of the story. You're answer:  Forget.  Sorry bubba, forgetting is NOT going to happen.  As I pressed, you indicated: "screw this guild"  Dude, gotta tell yea, that's an admission of guilt.  For the record, you were removed.  if you removed yourself, then it was as the same time as my /guildremove.  Mine was successful.<br>
<br>
Your attitude, however you intended will NOT be associated with Inferno's Hand in any shape or form.  If you didnt want to hear about how other were affected, you should have left.<br>
<br>
You made a very large mistake.  The sad part is, you're trying to justify it.  People take things in context.  Remember, we're dealing in a world that people are unable to see your expression, your body language.  We're limited to the text on the screen.  Once you start to realize that, you'll figure out that no matter how you "intend" to come across, you may be presenting yourself as a complete calous individual.  Point in case is this subject.<br>
<br>
Affro, I dont have anything personal against you.  Even the "asshole" title I'll let slide (you're right there).  I just hope that at some point you begin to understand the gravity of how people interpreted your comments.  Intention irregardless.<br>
<br>
This tradgedy holds different meaning to different people.  Any negative context will be taken badly.  Always bear that in mind.<br>
<br>
Now for the official statement:<br>
This kind of attitude will not be put up with at any time.  If any of our members feel the same about this situation and are unable to keep thier thoughts along those lines to themselves, then they are free to leave at any point.  If they do not leave, they will be removed. <p><B>Malamber</B>
