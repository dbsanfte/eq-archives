I have bad days... im having one today in fact.  This rant is about nothing in paticular, it has no basis in fact, only my meandering experience.  I will dispense this rant ... now!<br>
<br>
I started playing this game last July or so.... I came into the world as a Shadow Knight... wow... neriak is a great place to grow up... I killed and killed and killed... having no idea what the fuck I was doing... never even hearing the word.. TRAIN...<br>
<br>
I messed around with many classes, but never past level 10.  Until I settleed on my enchantress.  Damn life was fun... being able to get groups whenever, terrified of most of the world cuz I could die so fast.  Learning more every day how to charm, mez, buff and be a good party member.  I love being an enchantress.  I took and continue to take TREMENDOUS pride in being the best enchantress I can be.<br>
<br>
Everything was fine too.... until recently.  I dont know what started it, it could have been the pety break up of one of the better guilds on this server (EoN)  It could have been me becoming aware of the bickering and bullshit involved in getting my epic weapon.  It could have been the loss of many of my friends in Norrath to RL.  <br>
<br>
It could be the realization that the game penalizes you unreasonably for dying.  This one strikes a chord with me right now... so im gonna rant here for a bit.  OK... could SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME why when you die... you lose SIGNIFICANLY more xp then you stood to gain on that current encounter?  Could someone explain to me why melee classes are FUCKED if they dont bind in the right location every time they adventure somewhere.  <br>
<br>
I think the crux of everything comes do the fact that when you go 50+ every FUCKING thing becomes a GOD DAMN TIME SINK.  If you die.. you lose multiple hours, or potentially DAYS worth of XP.  If the server crashes... and you die cuz you were in a bad place... you could spend MANY MANY hours getting your body back.  I think it comes down to the fact that the game changes from a fun leisurely event, to a MAJOR investment of your life.  <br>
<br>
I am having serious problems logging in my enchantress, because when I do, I have to dedicate at LEAST 4-6 hours (or more) to do anything productive.  I need someone to help me.  I need to understand how people with LIVES play this game 50+.  Especially Enchanters and clerics.  When we leave groups... they END.  Alot of time the game is over for 5 other people because you have to tuck your kid into bed and read her a story.  <br>
<br>
Please excuse my weak use of language.  I dont use it often, but this is causing me to potentially say good-bye to a character I love dearly.  I am serious in my request.<br>
<br>
Several things could help me.<br>
<br>
1. Maybe im not hunting in the right places<br>
2. Is the guild im in significant in this persuit? <br>
3. How do I handle my time limits without people not wanting to group with me?<br>
<br>

As such, experience loss is easily negated by a cleric.  So is bind location.<br>

Not everything requires 4-6 hours.  But I can't share any insight to good spots to fight for a 50+ chanter, never done it.  My blind suggestion would be to try to group with 1-2 people in an easy to access area. <p>&nbsp;- Leo</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uharne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Harne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/8/01 9:03:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Help me... please</span><hr size=1> Dear Anna,<br>
<br>
I know how some people are driven by getting experience and hitting the higher levels. Its frustrating to see the xp bar move so slowly after 51. It CRAWLS. With that, my outlook in the game is a bit different now. <br>
<br>
I know that I will get the experience to level in time. Its just a matter of putting in the time to kill things with a group. You need to devote yourself to do that on occasion. But it shouldn't be your constant goal. The xp bar does not bother me that much anymore. I don't concentrate on leveling anymore. I concentrate on having FUN in the game again. <br>
<br>
Sure there are times I would get a group just for xp purposes. But most of the time, I spend it doing stuff with friends. Whether or not I get xp is sometimes irrelevant. If I do, great. If I don't, I'll get it eventually. I really try to enjoy my time on EQ. I figure why stress myself out more than I have to. I play EQ to escape the stress in RL not to compound it even further. <br>
<br>
I guess my outlook on what is 'productive' may be different from yours. For me, being 'productive' is having a blast with friends in this game. This isn't a job or career. Its a game I play to have FUN. <br>
<br>
I would HATE to lose a friend like you to this. The game is frustrating at times. I won't argue with you about that. We all have a love-hate relationship with this game. <br>
<br>
Take a step back. Just how important is it to get to the next level when you just have to start all over again to get more xp? Take a deep breath. Look around Norrath. Enjoy your time there. Be with friends and have some wild adventures. <br>
<br>
Your friend always, <p><a href=mailto:grayeman@aol.com>Harne MourningBlade</a><BR>

<br>
I know its tough and am sorry you are having so much difficulty.  I think Harne hit the nail on the head girl.  I dont have much to add to that except to re-iterate how after 50 EQ is all about friends.<br>
<br>
It is difficult to impossible to get a pickup group anymore.  You and I are kinda in the same boat.  Both refugees of the EoN breakup, all of are friends have scattered to the winds.  I miss my friends and I miss /gu greatly.  It was nice to be part of a guild and have many of your friends in one place.<br>
<br>
Change was forced upon us.  Personally for me it is extremely hard to stay in touch will all the people I called friends using the friends list.  I now have had to reachout and attempt to make new friends and its hard but a couple of things I have settled into post 50.<br>
<br>
Most important is to use your friends list and try to get into groups as soon as you get on line.  Have people save you a spot.  After doing this every night for a while you will find people that have the same play times as you and soon enough people will come looking for you.  The benifit for you being an enchanter is that /LFG on actually can help your class, also you are much needed and can get into XP groups better than most.<br>
<br>
I have a list of many people I try to contact as soon as I get online, I want XP, but mostly I want to have fun. Some nights I totally strike out and either log or play a twink but that happens sometimes.  Another thing I do is troll boards looking for raids that occur at the times I play and I send LOTs of /tells.  I know I prolly annoy people sometimes but I have to be agressive to get groups since Wizards are mostly usless.<br>
<br>

I was unclear on one point.  I dont care about my xp going up... hehe I could stay 52 for a LOOOOONG time and be happy.  It isnt that.  I guess I feel like there is significantly fewer things to DO in EQ as you level up, when it feels like the opposite should be true.  When I was level 20-30 there seemed to be 100 things to do in EQ that I could do with one or two other people.  I am begining to wonder if part of my problem lies in a lack of knowledge of where I can go with say.. just me and a certain cute bard, or monk or just a few of my friends.  The reality of things are, when you need more then 4 people to get together to do something, you stand a fair chance of it taking a while to get together and start adventuring.<br>
<br>
So I guess I need to look at my first point.  Where do I hunt?  So far I ahve been looking in Karnors, The Hole, Seb, Chardok and of course Raids.  Anyone else notice that except for chardok, that all of these are difficult to get to and can easily take 30 min to an hour to even get to, before you even know if your group can hunt there?<br>
<br>
My issue with XP isnt with gaining it... it is with losing it, and potentially your level.  It is a frustrating part of the game, but honestly one that I dont stand a chance of changing so I accept this as a necessary evil.<br>
<br>
Thank you guys for this start of ideas... I need all the help I can get :) <p><center>

I remember all the times I waited for groups to form, or raids to get started and ALOT of times just looking for a group. The game is a time sink and for many that devote 40 plus hours to work or school ,etc.. <br>
<br>
One of the things that I have learned from Kelderre was planning. I usually have a good Idea what I am going to be doing before I log on at night. I check my guild board for events and look in our grouping section to see what's going on and then weigh my options. I have a group of friends that I play with fairly often and I check with them the night before to see if they want to set up a group for exp, camping an item somebody needs or just exploring.<br>
<br>
When you leave a guild or the guild breaks up it can be a very trying time. I was guildless for about 6 weeks before I joined MW. I left a great guild and it was very difficult to keep in contact with many of them on a regular bases. But I made it work, and raid and exp with members of Gk when ever I can. I have a few friends that I almost never get to group with anymore but having a friends list is a beautiful thing. I check it fairly often and it keeps me in touch with ALOT of people I cant group with on a regular biases.<br>
<br>
On the dying part I can only repeat what I was told by another Monk when I was about 45th lvl or so. &quot;If dying bothers you, don't play a Monk or an enchanter &quot; When ever I don't pay attention to my exp bar it flies by. When ever I try to exp it seems to creep. <br>
<br>
Anytime you want to talk or group just send me a tell in game. We can plan exp group, explore someplace you have not been to yet or just camp something.<br>

<br>
Clerics and enchanters are very key classes in a normal group these days,  don't get me wrong though,  with the right combo,  you can have a very nice group without either of the two if you can take advantage a lot of the other classes skills,  but these 2 specific classes make things a whole lot easier generally.  Its can often seem rather sad when you have 5 people ready to go,  yet cannot get just 1 chanter or cleric,  and end up calling it a night without accomplishing a thing.  The need for these 2 classes are greater when mobs start to summon and root parking won't be effective,  along with the amount of damage some of them dish out that only the cleric can avoid becoming oom from healing at times.<br>
<br>
Remember before the high levels when the group composition didn't have to be a certain formula so much?  They were more effective,  but it didn't mean certain death as now days if you try to attempt some things without a key class...<br>
<br>
Population is another key factor...  many of my guildmembers and I were transfered from test server after certain equipment wipe that would not be reimbursed (really though it was a complete character wipe,  and then when enough people complained they restored or characters naked).  At peak times,  the highest I ever saw the server get to was about 600!  You could pick and choose where you wanted to go and not worry about the entire zone being camped.  With 1800+,  I often sit around discussing which zones/areas aren't camped that we can do.  Its not much fun when theres 10 other warriors LFG in a zone just hoping to get a group because theres plenty of supply yet no demand.  Verants solution to this is to create more expansions and zones.  As far as possibly not hunting in the right areas,<br>
<br>
Lately I've been finding myself loggin in,  saying hi,  little chit chat here and there (which I do enjoy very much btw <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ,  yet often nothing besides that.  Its nice when I do get a invite for a group right away,  but most often that opportunity does not happen and someone has to take the initiative to get a game plan going.  Day after day that takes a lot of effort for myself in the long run,  and I've been finding myself not wanting to deal with it.  <br>
<br>
When I do feel like doing it though,  I sometimes post in my guild events forum planning a group ahead of time for a date and place and that often gets the ball rolling.  <br>
<br>
I hope you find some sort of answer,  and if you ever need a warrior,  feel free to call upon me. <p><img src=http://www.manorhouse.addr.com/images/banners/chubu1.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uannastazia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Annastazia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/8/01 11:47:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Help me... please</span><hr size=1> /snicker Cucu... my alt is a monk...<br>

It takes a bit of work to setup a group no matter what zone you're in, and it takes some deaths before you learn who is good at playing what classes.  But you eventually form little circles of friends all over the place and usually will have little to no difficulty getting groups together.<br>
<br>
The best thing to do is to try and find a few people with similar playing times/styles.  It took me a long time, but 90% of the time I group with the same 3 or 4 people.  We plan on doing it as much as we can, and we communicate when we can/cannot make it at our specified time.  It cuts down on the time lost due to group assembly significantly (note we only play for 2.5 or 3 hours at the most a night, and still end up crashing through a lot of stuff).<br>
<br>
It IS difficult to adjust to the 51+ levels, but with the right friends, time and xp flies <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Your a great Chanter.  Hunting for exp is a frustrating for a lot of people.<br>
The long setup time can be very aggravating.<br>
<br>
I don't think your guild is the issue, but that's something you need to figure out for yourself.<br>
<br>
My routine is fairly simple.<br>
Log in.  guildcheck who needs help on what?<br>
If no-one needs help, and there isn't a raid, I proceed to seek exp groups.<br>
I typically sit in Seb, consider HS, or log and play my rogue twink.<br>
I typically will sit for 30 minutes trying to get an exp group.  It takes more than <br>
just putting up LFG and waiting for people to come to you.<br>
I may even log, and go watch a movie or play RL a little.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is if you get a bit frustrated with your main character, try something else.<br>
Try hunting in a different spot, try helping other people with hunts or raids.<br>
Try even a twink character to &quot;drive a different car&quot; for a change.<br>
Or go catch the latest movie.<br>
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  Avoid burnout.<br>
<br>
After I finally get a new level, I typically take a week off from exp hunting.<br>
It can be so TEDIOUS killing the same things over and over for hours on end.<br>
I'll quest, help friends, or play the twinky.<br>

<br>
I myself haven't logged on all week simply because I haven't had the time this week to play - I've been very busy.<br>
<br>
But yes, I understand what you mean.  To make any sort of significant progress, you need a good 4-5hours of exping.  ESPECIALLY in 51, 54, and, I would imagine, 59 (heh).<br>
<br>
Yes, Seb is a bloody pain in the ass to get to.  So is Chardok.<br>
However, as an enchanter, it's one of two things to get a group in Seb.  It's either 1)  Very easy or 2)  Impossible - so, here's the deal.  Next time you have some time, go group in Seb.  When you bind outside, stay bound there, and at the end of the night get a port someplace you can use productively.  I myself get a port to WC/Sro/LS/Nek so I can continue checking on Cazel and Verina Tomb, both of whom apparently got together and decided they will never spawn again as long as I need their drops for my epic. <br>
<br>
First - ways to get a group as fast as possible - Note, not surefire, I spend my fair share of time sitting on my ass doing nothing with a star next to my name.<br>
<br>
When you log on, check with your friends and see if they need you for a group.  If they do, and you're in, say, WC, you're in an area very easy for them to pick you up in.<br>
If they don't, and I'm not on, send someone in ES a tell, such as Dreslav, Yorak, or Lorian, because apparently whenever I'm not on, all those freaks suddenly need an enchanter (of course, when I *am* on everyone is too busy for me..  *sniff*  J/k  guys.. hehe).  If none of THEM can help you, pop a tell to a friend or guildie in Seb and ask them to see if anyone needs an enchanter.  If you don't have any friends/guildies in Seb, then just sit back for a bit with lfg on and hang out for a while.  If someone from Seb DOES send you a tell, you're bound there, so there's no annoying travel involved.  Most of the time I keep myself bound there for that <br>
very reason.<br>
<br>
If you're pressed for time, ALWAYS GROUP WITH A CLERIC.<br>
I know it sounds biased.  I myself have done my share of groups that used two druids as a healer or something else to replace a cleric, and they worked fine.  However, if you die in those groups, and, as an enchanter, you're at a high risk for that - you will WASTE A TRUCKLOAD of time, especially if it was a wipe, because now CR is a bitch if people are bound far.<br>
Also, the fact that you just lost a chunk of experience is the biggest downfall.  So, unless you're absolutely positive that the no-cleric group is going to be very efficient and that you will not die, stick to a group with a cleric in it.  Unless of course, you've got a lot of time that day and wouldn't mind playing around in a "non-standard" group in which case, a lot of them can be a load of fun.  =)<br>
<br>
Yes - there are significantly fewer and fewer things to do as you level.  You can't solo stuff as easily anymore, and you start to need almost full groups just to kill half the stuff that's gonna give you exp.<br>
There are some innovative, yet dangerous, ways to exp without a full group, but, since you're hung up on experience loss, I wouldn't try charm soloing or anything like that unless you're partnered with a cleric (in which case, it's no longer soloing..  heh).<br>

<br>
there are many things in this game that you can do.  i challenge you on the one point you make when you say the higher the lvl you go, the less there is to do.  i am discovering trade skills now, and the importance of them, and what trade skills can do for me.  i am discovering the extreme importance of faction, especially in velious.  i am discovering hundreds of quests i have never learned of.  i am meeting new people every day just through socialization and friends.  i am helping out others when i can with their epics, thus getting personal satisfaction out of that.<br>
<br>
i have learned that the game is what you make of it.  you can get into a strong xp grind frame of mind, which i have been for the past month or so.  and it can affect you in a negative fashion, as at times it did for me.  you can look at the game from a quest standpoint, and get accomplishment in that.  you can look at the game from a skill standpoint, where you are benefitting yourself by increasing your skill in, say, tailoring.<br>
<br>
the game can be fun if you have that frame of mind.  it can be very frustrating if you have that frame of mind.  it is what is going through your mind that helps you decide how much fun you are having.  i hope that in your case, you approach all you do with a positive and enjoyable frame of mind =D<br>

I think what you may need is just a flat out  break before you implement any ideas people may give you.  This camel had 2 straws left on his back (especially wihtthe whole dying/exp issue) before deciding to go MIA for a little bit.  When you come back you look upon norrath wiht refreshed eyes.  Of course, all the same problems remain, but you are more relaxed and it doesn't short your fuse so quickly.  After playin this game for so long it can really statrt getting to you.  Every little thing that annoys you seems to be unusually unbareable day after day.  Not thinking about it for a little clears your hate list (hehe).  But hey, at least you have a partner at almost all times.  Tell Tinman I said hi.<br>
       But enough of this sad stuff.  How ya been?!!!!  Soory I can't recommend any other places to hunt other than the ones you've named.  Man I misss being in EoN.  I need to get back on and find a guild, that could take a little while.  And now I have a gnome necro thats lvl 19.  Probly play him for a little while.  Abber is still lvl 51.  But oh so close to 52.  I'll be back in Norrath full time sin about a week.  I'll look for ya, I luv just adventuring these days with abber, its a nice change from exp groups.<br>

Sure some classes can stretch it to 60, but as a warrior at 57, I sort of need healers when I encounter blue mobs.  <br>
<br>
Try and find a spot to make xp at 57 that is outdoors, other than skyfire where time spent for xp gained is nearly useless (half the mobs seem green anyhoo).  PoG would work if it wasn't so dang tough and the faction hit so bad.  So I'm sorta stuck to 1 spot in karnors, sebilis, chardok, HS and a few obscure locations that are frequently entirely camped (raptors, walking armor in WL, etc..).  <br>
<br>
So it's reasonable to assume that time well spent is in a high lvl dungeon in a sufficient group, which usually requires a lvl 60 puller or enchanter/bard for mez.  Getting 3 people can take lots of time and 6 people especially if one is an important class can take an hour.  <br>
<br>
Sum it up, it takes way to long to get anywhere to start anything and we can't all live in seb cause there's not enough room, not to mention chardok and HS aren't good pickup locations.  I suspect Verant will fix some of this problem with SoL and more raiding areas help those of us who kind of get tired sitting in the same spot (raptors blech), but it could just be my own desires for some reasonable game play.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I've picked up my UO habit again.  With candyland (no pk's) I can go nuts killing stuff for 30 min, recall to town bank my loot, sit aorund talking to noobs.  Wow a conversation with someone. <p><img src=http://www.manorhouse.addr.com/images/banners/myahak1.jpg

I have a couple of SKs I hang out with who used to both be around 20, but now are 23 and 30. I just have a lot of fun helping them get around, and do things like Temple of Sol Ro quests. Its also gives me a reason to use my awesome powers. Now there is a purpose to pulling out a pet and carving through some greens in CT, instead of feeling like every Mobs rag doll in Karnors or whereever. Plus the delight a true new player gets when you acquire something for them that is out of their reach is priceless. Of course it helps that my alt is a SK so I am doing all the research for quests and equipment for him as well. <br>
<br>
For me its really just a great pleasure watching younger characters develop. I also get the added bonus of seeing where they hunt, which can be very different from where I went at the corresponding levels. <br>
<br>
I also try and spend time helping young enchanters, I know that I had help from other enchanters at exactly the right time when I was coming up. A HE lvl 40 Ench (I cant remember her name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     ) helped me out in Guk to get my Incandscent mask and Insidious Rod when I was 30, she also made a star ruby ring for me for no charge, the other night another enchanter dropped exactly the spells I was looking for on me for 51 - 54. I have tried to pay this back by giving advice, handing out research spells, and making jewelry (for free) to younger enchanters. I think at times this can be more rewarding than worrying about exp for my next level. I think we have a great enchanter community on Lanys, even if we don't get to group together very much.<br>

<br>
- Go to a newbie or lowbie zone and practice your trade skills while shouting &quot;Free clarity at &lt;where you are&gt;&quot;. You can also organize little quests by offering some pp for stuff you need while training (ex : snake eggs, pelts, silk, meat, etc...)<br>
<br>
<br>
- Visit some friendly NPCs, talk to them and try to do some quests by yourself. The reward of the quest is not that important, but you'll see that it's more interesting than looking at a spoiler telling &quot;get this, give it to X, you'll get that, go to &lt;someplace&gt;, give &quot;that&quot; to Y, and you'll earn &lt;phat lewt&gt;&quot;. Quests are based on stories, and you'll feel like Sherlock Holmes, trying to solve unknown mysteries...<br>
<br>
The rewards may even reserve you some nice surprises. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- You're an enchanter, and a jeweler. You may want to raise your faction with gem merchants. Just find what mobs you have to kill (or easy quests) to raise your faction with them. You can also try to raise your faction in places where yours is bad, or even in places where you're kos. (why not visiting Cabilis as an elf?) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
