Valric Vs Tormentcia?<br>
Sheesh!  I dont even know the guy but if I will let someone be damned for something they didnt do and I know it you may as well damn me too!<br>
<br>
Lets see how to solve this???<br>
I know! Comedy Central, dont take your dispute to court take it to BOWLING!!<br>
I say we all bet on who wins Valric or Tormentcia!!<br>
I am betting Valric bowls just under 100 and Tormentcia bowls just under 110. *snicker*<br>
<br>
Anyone willing to take 3 to 1 odds on mah bet? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uckorikkatorath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ckorik Katorath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/13/01 8:33:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Odd, or No?</span><hr size=1> No support from me - I was on the gorndax raid where valric threw a fit and demanded that his mobs be pulled.<br>

There is a rant here on the boards from it all 'vlaric you pathetic piece of shit'...<br>
<br>
I was there - in person - and all I can say is what a tool.<br>
<br>
I will never raid with him.  I will leave any raid he is on - I will try to stay out of the same zone he is in.<br>
<br>
I know many people who feel the same way, but make your own judgements... I will however stand by what *I* have personally witnessed.  <br>

Visnet and Harpexx, I'm not going by hearsay. &nbsp;I personally witnessed this scum in action. &nbsp;I reported his profanity, including several unwanted sexual comments... so many in fact, that I had to zone over 10 times just to /report a lot of them. &nbsp;Vishanti was right here watching as well, and ended up speaking to an officer in his guild that night. &nbsp;Valric then brushed off our complaints and asked Vishanti to go to Hate with him. &nbsp;That's what I meant when I said he only acts like he respects you when he needs something. &nbsp;Ask around a bit more. &nbsp;You'll find a lot of people who regard him as a waste of biomass based on their personal experiences with him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unirecnadthetrademaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirecnad the Trademaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1256<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/13/01 9:01:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Odd, or No?</span><hr size=1> Dude!<br>

Let's start with Valric's latest outburst of stupidity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Raid continues while Valric and Gorn discuss, brought to OOC and hell ensues. Raid continues, all leave.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For all of the detail that he provides elsewhere, Valric sure does skip over that part of the story pretty quickly.  I posted the full story on this board a few months ago in response to Gorndax's flame of Valric.  While I have criticisms of the way that Gorndax conducted himself, I have nothing but disgust for the way that Valric disrupted the raid and went on a bizarre tirade against Gorndax.  Valric acknowledged that Gorndax was calling the shots, then bitched about it all night.  When Gorndax was slow in pulling the Abhorrents (which drop the rogue armor that Valric wanted so badly), Valric exploded and instigated a pathetic pissing match that brought the raid to a screeching halt.  Valric actually said that he was just going to go pull the mobs himself if Gorndax didn't pull them.<br>
<br>
During the course of the night, Valric was also trying to persuade the members of our group to just keep some of the items that we looted and not tell Gorndax that they had dropped.  I said hell no, and so did the other members of the group, who I believe were CoH members.<br>
<br>
This guy is a total scumbag.  Ever since that raid, I have refused to have anything to do with this guy.  I don't group with people like that.  I recently found out that a druid I grouped with twice in OS -- Syano -- is also Valric.  It made me want to puke to know that I'd actually come into contact with the guy again.  That's one more name on my /ignore list.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now for the Sagemon/Tormentcia issue all I can figure out is because of Darmu's PoG raid which I went on. Come to find out Sagemon had one planned for the next day and no one knew, Sagemon told Darmu but he wouldn't step down.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, right.  The Friday PoG raid was organized by Quis, not Darmu.  I told Quis that I was totally cool with it because we would still have all of the mobs east of the river for our Saturday raid, and that we could do repops if we had time left over.  It was a total non-issue. <br>
<br>
Our raid went just great.  Valric kept begging me to join the raid, and I brushed him off.  There was no way in hell that guy was joining our raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Darmu tells me we need clerics. I ask Sagemon and he doesn't seem pleased. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No shit.  I don't like getting tells from turds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now I still don't know why that would cause SAgemon and his girlfriend to harrass me, but oh well. All I have to say is Sagemon, if you think I was intentionally making fun of you, mocking you what ever, sorry bro. I seriously didn't know. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Valric keeps referring to Tormentcia (who lives 1000 miles away from me with her fiance) as my girlfriend because he thinks it pisses me off.  Torm and I have been getting some good laughs out of the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Notice how Valric is looking for some explanation for my flames other than the fact that they might be deserved.  It's really sort of pathetic.<br>
<br>
Now let's turn to Harpexx.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Personaly, I have read and heard a lot of shit about Valric. It's hardly ever backed with any real proof, just someones assumption of a situtation, or hearing it from a friends dogs cousins uncles mothers neighbor who knows a man who knows a man , blah blah.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Pull your head out of your ass, Harpexx.  I observed what Valric did with my own eyes, as did a lot of other people on this board.  This is fact, not rumor. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It seems almost like your tryin to turn Valric into Ghalewind_02, and get everyone riding him. Fortunately Valric knows how to type a paragraph without saying 'fuck' every other word, so he can defend himself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really?  Here's an example of Valric's elevated prose, from a thread on the Dragons and Planes board:<br>
<br>
&quot;Sagemon, your a fucking moron. M-O-R-O-N.<br>
<br>
&quot;How many times you going to mix up the events? Maybe your not moxing them up, perhaps just purposely distorting them because your a dick.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am the one who was at the hate raid who got in an arguement with Gorndax. I wasn't the one who did that to Vishanti. I am the one who got the epic. So, you can basically kiss my ass and go ahead spouting your bullshit stories bro.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for Ghalewind, I don't know him (or her), so I can't comment.  If he's as big a dirtbag as Valric, that would be an impressive feat.<br>
<br>
Next came this gem from Visnet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sheesh! I dont even know the guy but if I will let someone be damned for something they didnt do and I know it you may as well damn me too!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really?  You know that Valric didn't do all of those things?  I'd like to hear more about that.  I don't remember your name coming up in any of the prior threads about the stuff that Valric has done.  Did those two blue bubbles of experience during the PoG raid give you some deeper insight?  Or did Valric just promise you a BD?<br>
<br>
It's fascinating that Valric, of all people, would seek to portray himself as a victim.  Not very many people are going to buy that one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utormentcia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormentcia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/14/01 1:44:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Odd, or No?</span><hr size=1> Sage, that's nut hugging girlfriend I believe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Tormentcia

You've worn out your welcome here. I have had too many bad experiences with you to care what you think is odd. In my mind your a foul mouthed loot whore.  <br>
<br>
I'll tell ya odd. You know i can't stand you, but still you ask me to pull a mob for you in Velks tonight? After all the nasty things you've said and done? You have some nerve. <br>
<br>
Ps  I'm still waiting for you to post the log you have of the time I chewed your ass out for trying to ks a named mob in velks.  (he threatens me that he will post the log??? why would anyone threaten another by saying &quot;i'll post what an ass i was&quot;??) <br>
<br>
Pss I honestly think you need counseling. Please spend time with a psychiatrist instead of playing EQ. It will do you (and us) more good.<br>
<br>
<br>
ahhh.. I feel better now  <br>
