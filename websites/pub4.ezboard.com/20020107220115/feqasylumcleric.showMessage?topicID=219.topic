I just spent about 3 hours in HoT, pull group cleric.<br>
<br>
The monk puller would come in, and FD down 3 (or more) bubbles.  Usually pulling an AE mob (will continue to take damage).  MA, also in my group begins to attack.  I'm not sure what the situation was, but he was taking a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
If I cast a heal on the MA, it had to be Complete Heal, or it wouldn't save me any time.  By the time the Cheal hit, puller was dead.<br>
<br>
If I cast a heal on the puller, MA was usually hurt bad enough that I couldn't get a Cheal off in time, and Divine would barely keep up with the damage (or not).<br>
<br>
We pulled a large number of mobs, and it seemed like every 3-5 mobs, either the puller or the MA died.  I can't speak for them, but it was wearing on me alot.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any suggestions?  Most obvious would be to take the MA out of the pull group, I'd guess, but what else could be done?<br>
<br>
P.S. to make things more interesting, I had a third tank in my group I had to try to keep alive also.  I had a druid in another group keep an eye on his hps.<br>

<br>
Main assist wasn't peeling off the monk fast enough, monk taking too much damage either from melee when FD failed or from AE on an AE mob (they tend to AE and hit the monk as the main assist aggros and brings them in)<br>
<br>
Lack of resists all around.  Mob should in theory be sticking to only ONE tank, so all other damage needing to be healed (excluding puller) should be AE or ripostes.  If mob is bouncing around, it's hard to focus heals on one person since by the time it lands, another person could have aggro and be mostly dead by then.  If the problem is excessive AE damage, people probably need to get better resist gear, more bards on the raid or higher levels to increase resist %.<br>
<br>
Lack of backup healing.  Sounds like you might have been trying to do just too much for one healer to handle, especially if the above is true.  Maybe get a druid in the pull/MA group to help heal when things get tight, they make *superb* backup healers if they aren't 1-59.9 solo players, then suddenly decide they need groups to get phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
Just my opinions, when you're the only healer healing several tanks and the puller, things are gonna be rough.  Best immediate short-term solution is probably a reliable backup healer in your group.  Then reevaluate resists and levels, as they affect AEs to a very significant degree. <p><b><i>Huffadopolis Polychronopolis</b></i>

As a non-DAing puller in HoT it seems they will die a lot.  Even when I had just the pally puller in my group it was hard to keep him alive and he died a lot.  Deaths every couple pulls wore on me as a cleric, as if somehow I should have been able to heal him even though he was usually too far away to heal.  It feel like you are failing as a cleric at times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I have to agree about the resist. In HoT only the MA should be gaining agro, otherwise the other tanks are doing something wrong, or thier resists need some serious work.  Another thing is to think about the raid, if the puller dies in a pull worst that happends is you need to res them and maybe a bit more down time between pulls.  If the MA dies, you need to have the SA take over assuming they are tanking an add, and with multi pulls with and MA down fast that can mean wipe out, or least resing a significantly larger number of people.  Again, if you look at the worst in each situation letting the puller die is going to hold up the raid and be more productive to the raid as well.  Also try asking the raid leader if they can switch it up, if you say that this is not working and you are being over taxed, most the times the raid leader will switch things up. <p><center><img src="http://students.washington.edu/zip/eq/misch.jpg"></center>

<br>
I've been on a pull group, there is always a back up healer there and we agreed in our terms what to do when one is either dead or OOM. Heals start immediately when their hit. In certain cases, unfortunately, you cannot help it and this is where Perplex was saying, you have to decide on who is going to survive and who will not. The one who can do the most damage and can take the hits is morelikely to survive to help the remedy the situation. <br>

The best thing I can think off is to have a 2nd cleric cast level 59 celestial healing spell on the MA while the mob isn't slowed. Even if a cleric in another group is need to do this it isn't much of a problem. Just have let them know to always cast their DoT heal when the mob is inc so you can have more time to work with. The 2nd cleric won't have to worry about their group since ideally the MA should be the only one getting hit with melee and  is the only that should require fast heals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukayshasoulsinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaysha Soulsinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/8/01 12:30:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Healing Dilemna</span><hr size=1> A DoT Heal is - ironically in this case <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  - commonly called a HoT <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for the matter at hand, yes, you should choose to keep the MA alive. If you can save the Puller at the same time, fine, but should you have to choose, the MA is more important. The Puller is FD on the ground anyway, not doing anything at that moment, while the MA is keeping the MoB busy. Should the MA die, you are in trouble for sure. It really isn't the question &quot;should I let the puller die?&quot; but more &quot;should I keep the MA alive?&quot;. That answer should be yes, imho.<br>
<br>
I once had a similar situation during a raid on City of Mists, being main healer to the MA and the puller (if memory serves correctly). At one point the puller brought in several Black Reavers which started a good beating not only on the MA but also on a few others of the party. I decided to cast CHeal on the MA even though she said herself I should heal others and simply let her die. I think if she would have, we would have had a much harder situation on our hands (in the end, only two people died during that multi-pull). <p><br><A Href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=30878"><IMG

<br>
I have now been the cleric in the pull group in HoT raids many times, and the problem you describe is all to familiar to me.<br>
<br>
I recall the first time I was given this job was only my second ever visit to HoT. The previous time I'd been G2 cleric with SA, and it was a breeze, even if MA went down, just meat and drink work for the experienced cleric. But to this second visit, I was given a pull group with a skilled monk puller, a level 60 warrior as MA, a second melee, a bard and a druid. Having done pull group in almost every raid there is, this didn't phase me at all, no problem for me, I thought. I was wrong.<br>
<br>
In the first couple of hours, the MA and puller both died repeatedly. Yes, sometimes it was due to an enrage message being missed, and sometimes the puller died when in deep; these are things no cleric can do anything about. But on most occasions it was simply that the damage rate of the mobs, when the slow took time to hit, was too darn great for me to keep up with, and often I had to choose who lived and who died, and on the few occasions I fought to keep both puller and MA alive, on some of them, both died. I *HATE* people dieing on my watch, so to speak, and it happens rarely enough when it is my fault (or I think it is) that it this made me very unhappy, questioning my own skill and blaming myself for slowing the raid down. I became really rather ill-tempered *grin*.<br>
<br>
I stuck with it, and a second cleric, in a group with far less loading, and seeing my worsening mood (gulp) started to help in healing the puller. This made the difference. It made *all* the difference. The number of puller/MA deaths dropped dramatically.<br>
<br>
Looking back, analytically and obviously not in the fluster of the situation, some facts became clear. The raid had a lower level slower, and this meant slow was almost always late. The pull group back up healer was not as, shall we say, fast at healing, as was needed. My spell timing on pulls was not as practiced for HoT as it needed to be. This puller did not shout 'Incoming' before each pull arrived, the first I knew was it beating the hell out of the MA (bfore he called assist). These were all problems. The biggest problem of all, however, is a cleric's trained view to 'look after their own'; I *should* have asked for more help earlier, instead of blaming myself, because, retrospectively, I was not actually doing anything seriously wrong, tho perhaps as I said, spell timing is slightly different now in HoT pull group role.<br>
<br>
I have done this role many times since then, with no repeat of the problems I had the first time. Higher level slow-casters, some of the best back-up druid healers in the game, and pullers who actually tell the raid BEFORE the mob hits the MA all helped a LOT. My own attitude, to *tell* the raid leader when I thought the healing power of the pull group was light before it caused deaths also helped a LOT as well (I did have a pull group in HoT with no back up healer once, for 30 mins, and that was not clever, but there was a cleric in another group watching MA as well for me).<br>
<br>
In summary, my advice from my limited but non-trivial expriences as pull group cleric in HoT are:<br>
<br>
1) Make sure you have a back up healer. Preferably one in group. If there isn't one, nag the raid leader until he/she gives you one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Most raid leaders will have the sense to listen to such a sensible request. All of mine have. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
2) Make sure the back up healer knows the job WELL, I mean, very well. No standard soloing druid will do here. Catching those who will die in less than 5 seconds when the cleric is 5 seconds into a CH *every time* is a skill to be valued. Most druids I group with now are experts in this field. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
3) Some pullers do not have 'INC' hotkeys. If they don't, pester them. And don't stop pestering them until they give in just to get some peace. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Seriously, this is important. I have found it to be vital.<br>
<br>
4) Be a nagger if you are not happy with aggro control or the healing skill of your back up *grin*. Clerics are bossy because they need to be, generally. There is nothing worse than those other than the MA/SA drawing aggro 'for fun'. Or the pull group druid who wants to nuke or dot and not be 100% healer, when the cleric is overloaded. I've had this a few times, be ruthless, tell the raid leader, or let them die, or both. They WILL learn. They HAVE to.<br>
<br>
5) As for spells, well, I can't give advice to you that you don't already know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    There are different ways of doing this, though. On my last 2-3 HoT raids, I was not pull group cleric, Amori was, and she has her own way of doing it. Myself, I use Remedy for long range healing on the monk (to keep them alive), drop CE on the MA before he engages at all, and then concentrate wholly on the MA until slow and/or defensive are in. Everyone else is secondary; it is the back up healers job once the puller is back in range to keep him/her alive. If I need help, I want other clerics dropping Divine Light on anyone who needs until I can get CE / CH on them, as appropriate. This seems to work well for me.<br>
<br>
Sure, some deaths still happen, HoT is a challenge. Those vehement wyverns especially are really nasty before slow hits, and can eat a few over-eager aggro-drawing tanks quite happily (lol I know so many will know what I mean). But this is what makes it fun! I hated the role when I did it the first time. I love it now. My favorite job. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Infact, I find HoT less fun if I don't have this role now.<br>
<br>
/bow<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
For younger clerics who might not know these terms:<br>
<br>
HoT = Halls of Testing, in the eastern Wing of the Temple of Veeshan (ToV), a level 56+ zone.<br>
MA = Main Assist<br>
SA = Second Assist<br>
CE = Celestial Elixir, level 59 spell like Cel Heal.<br>
CH = Complete Healing, the defining spell for clerics!<br>
<br>
In the higher level circles, and for anyone who played pre-Velious, CH is ALWAYS Complete Healing. Anyone think CH means Celestial Healing better learn fast or they will cause much confusion and get things wrong. Get in the habit now of using the abbreviation CH to mean only Complete Healing.<br>

1) Buffs &quot;need to be&quot; Aego (or glades/Marzin/Bulwark), Kragg/Focus, Health. Two Circlets. Regrowth/Regen. DS.<br>
2) Puller MUST have Fungi. Show in secondary is very helpful. I use cone of mystic in primary. 5AC baby! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
How it works. Pull AE mob. MA comes down to bottom of steps. Puller runs into the middle of the room into the nook between the pot and the bottom part of the stairs.  Avoids all AE damage.<br>
<br>
So, if you can survive the pull to the room, you can forget about healing your monk. I would pull into the room with full AC gear on, FD in the right spot, then Regen up.<br>
<br>
The problem for me came when I decided to rp and did the pull messages in Elder Dragon, not realizing that only the CoH mage, Arithos, could understand what I was saying.  Amori would give me some remedies, but it wasn't necessary.<br>
<br>
I was running around 3850 hp buffed.  At 58, I believe, monks get a jump on STA to HP conversion, so I'd be closer to 4K at that point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uleolan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leolan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Administrator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/8/01 12:17:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Healing Dilemna</span><hr size=1> Oops Feli.

Don't get me wrong, but a backup healer is not as necessary as one would think, imo.  If it's pulled right, it shouldn't matter, imo.  And trust, if there's a way to find a way to not pull something right, I'll be at the forefront of that pack. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

why people feel they need have the puller/peeler/MA in a the same group is something i don't understand...<br>
<br>
if the peeler can make a /shout INC message they can make the hotkey also send a private tell to the peeler at the same time if communticatoin is what they are worried about.<br>
<br>
<br>
there should never be a reason a cleric should have more then one main roleplayer in their group...should it be peeler/MA/puller/Slower/Main CC all should be in different groups on big raids....if you are short clerics...the Slower can survive in a 2 Druid groups (i'm a hugh fan of 2group druid healer groups for casters/classes that can self heal) <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">

<br>
my first post is how i do groups when i'm running a raid...the only cleric i give a heavy load to is myself i usually have Errtai (main CC) and either puller/MA in group.<br>
<br>
<br>
having a back up healer in a cleric group i find is a waste of cleric space...i would much rather have the groups set out with only one main roleplayer in each group and 4 secondary tanks..and the 2 druid casters groups.<br>
<br>
only time a druid sees my group on a raid is breaking fear (we all have evac) more cleric space then tanks...or at the end of the raid for ports =P<br>

Regarding roleplaying, I'll have you know that it is NOT good to switch your pull messages to say Elder dragon if no one else understand elder dragon.  Hehe, it was a lot of fun.  Fortunately, the coh mage did know what I was saying, so it was ok. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulaellanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laellanna</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/9/01 12:59:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/teriyakidonut/laellanna.gif http://members.home.net/teriyakidonut/laellanna.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Healing Dilemna</span><hr size=1> Keeping the main tank alive is crucial...

Most of them have allready been listed but I have a few new ones.<br>
<br>
The groups should be set up like Simc said, this is always how we do it.  Puller, main assist, secondary assist, and slower all get their own clerics.  Usually on ROA raids we get 3 clerics so we stick the slower with either the cleric who has the puller (NOT the second assist) or with a druid and another shaman or something.<br>
<br>
If there are a couple tanks with low levels and/or bad resists, you need to find out who they are and stick them with the bards, and tell them to hide if it gets to be too bad healing them.  As guild leader I can really get on someone's case if I am their cleric and they're taking more AOE damage than they should.  I tell em they can't come back if they don't raise their fire/cold by at least a certain amount <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Usually Simc and I have the the puller and MA in our seperate groups.  Let's say I have the puller, Simc can just yell to me if she needs me to help out by putting remedy or divine light on the MA.  Nowadays on our HoT raids typicaly the only people that die are the puller, people who steal aggro from the MA, people who don't turn off for enrage (bleh this still happens) and people who don't hide from the AE when we tell them.  Oh and then there's the times we get so bored doing HoT for the 100th time and we are watching TV or goofing around or something and someone dies.  <br>
<br>
Another good thing to plan for is extra mobs.  If you have a mala/malo person there you should be able to handle multiple mobs.  You should plan for this by designating the secondary assist (you did put him with his own cleric didn't you?) and having a mental note who a possible 3rd assist will be.  The important thing on a multi pull is to make sure everyone stands up when you yell add, and make sure you /target the slower no matter what group you're in and make sure they stay alive until everything gets slowed.<br>
<br>
One time we were fighting a white wurm and it gated, and brough back THREE other mobs, a mix of raptors and wyverns I think (none aoe).  We had to finish off the white wurm and contain the adds.  Second assist tanked one and I had to yell at our shadow knight to HT the mob off the shaman who had just malo'd and slowed one.  Shaman ended up malo'ing and slowing the mob the SA was on and then finally got the last mob slowed and ended up tanking it himself by using torpor! (Yes Beomahn is the most amazing shaman I have ever met)<br>
<br>
Anyways HoT can be miserable if you do some things wrong but it can be a nice enjoyable farm once you get levels, resists, and a few strategies down.  On good HoT farm days in ROA we can get 18-20 people there, and when an AOE wurm we are fighting goes to enrage our monk is allready pulling ANOTHER AOE mob.<br>
