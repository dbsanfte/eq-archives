They really might have something important to say."</i><br>
<br>
Really? ;) Well, that misses the point. If they are preaching at me then I didn't want to hear it. Preach to those who <b>ask</b> to hear the word.<br>
<br>
<i>"It just seems that you've had some very bad run in's with people who...."</i><br>
<br>
Yes, yes, I have heard this all before: "If you had just run into a <i>real</i> Christian" or "If you had run into a caring Christian". All such statements presume their is something wrong with the delivery of the message and not the message itself. Thing is, Lukaria, if I am not interested in Christianity at all (which I really am not), I will not want to hear the Christian message. Point is, those who believe I <b><i>need</i></b> to hear it and will deliever the message without asking me, or without trying to become a friend, are overbearing individuals who have exaggerated the worth of their importance. I have many Christian friends who understand that I am very familiar with their message and they feel no need to try to convert me. Indeed, I became friends with these people <b><i>not</i></b> because they preached at me.<br>
<br>
<i>"Who really has the close mind here, Lurikeen? I listen to other faiths, I simply do not believe. From your comments, I am led to believe you will not even extend that courtesy."</i><br>
<br>
First Lukaria, you are taking this far to personal. I am not attacking you, personally. If you want to lump yourself in with some of the Christians I refer to, then that is your business. Don't try to hold that against me. Second, I haven't stated that you have a closed mind. Why are you now interested in flaming me personally?<br>
<br>
<i>"However it seems from your responses that you have already made your mind up, we are wrong and arrogant because we think we know the truth, anyone who dares to speak of the Truth with a capital "T" is immediately an arrogant ass who is most likely a hypocrite, and surely - all christians should be lumped together."</i><br>
<br>
Lukaria, you are taking me out of context. Did I write that I think all those who believe they know truth with a capital "T" are arrogant? No! Did I write <b>ALL</b> Christians should be lumped together? NO! What I wrote is those who believe they know they have "the Truth" <b>AND</b> preach it to others without the consent of the hearer are arrogant asses. AND, I was perfectly clear that only <b>SOME</> Christians fall into that category. There is a big difference in what I am actually stating and what you think I am stating. Please go back and read the answers I provided to your two questions.<br>
<br>
<i>"And I am sorry, but I do find it hard to believe that you preach love and truth. From your past postings to me, which many were vulgar, rude, and antagonistic - "</i><br>
<br>
Yes, yes, and you are not a very forgiving person, Lukaria. To drag that up and throw into my face after apologizing to you on this board and in game shows what kind of person you really are. I will certainly not be responding to any more your posts. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 789<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/6/02 12:45:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=89>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> <i>"And as always, I do not respond to flaming or completely sarcastic responses designed to belittle what I said."</i><br>

Now, THAT answers my question.  Nothing you said before did.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Point is, those who believe I need to hear it and will deliever the message without asking me, or without trying to become a friend, are overbearing individuals who have exaggerated the worth of their importance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is a generality, and you are lumping together people here.  You are saying anyone who preaches any type of faith message without first getting your express permission and/or becoming a friend - are all overbearing individuals?  Is this correct?  Does this extend to the corner preacher?  The ones who knock on the door?  The ones on TV?  Or only those you personally meet somewhere?  Or?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First Lukaria, you are taking this far to personal. I am not attacking you, personally.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, I didn't take it personally at all.  I apologize if you consider the close-minded comment to be a flame, especially when it was not meant to be.  Obviously, I didn't write that part well.  You probably skipped over my disclaimer about that.  So let me elaborate and try to clarify that.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a better way to state is this: From your comments both now and in the past, I personally have deduced that you immediately close your mind to others messages of faith, especially if they are Christians.  I.E. You refuse adamantly to listen at all.  Also, from your comments both now and in the past, I have personally deduced that you will not extend the courtesy of listening to a public prayer of anyfaith, especially Christian, because of the above beforementioned decision of refusal.  This situation is exacerbated if the person speaking speaks of their faith as knowing the &quot;truth&quot; with a capital &quot;T&quot;, and immediately you then classify them as an arrogant ass (due to you definition of not asking you first or knowing you as a friend).<br>
<br>
Now, if the above statements I have deduced are incorrect, I would welcome the opportunity for you to clarify that for me.<br>
<br>
As for taking it personally, I certainly do not take your comments personally on any level, however, I am a person who shares my faith, sometimes without expressly asking if I can share my faith first.  Sometimes, the subject just comes up and I respond to the openess of the conversation.  I believe my faith is the truth with a capital &quot;T&quot; and I certainly state it that way.  In this case, according to your definition, I would now be an arrogant ass.  Now, is this correct or not?<br>
<br>
This is from your post:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
<br>
Jesus expects people to be able to observe the lives of believers to the point that they can make a sound decision to accept or reject the good news. What that means is no bible thumping.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
<br>
True.  He also expects us to teach believers and non-believers his message of truth and sacrifical love.  That would mean sharing the gospel, that would mean reading the bible, that would mean bible thumping in a positive sense so to speak.  So.  I disagree.<br>
<br>
This is where I get the arrogant part from though.  Perhaps what you need to do is clarify.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Those who think that preaching Christ crucified outside of making friends with people is anything less than arrogance have <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, I must be arrogant, Lurikeen.  I think that by sharing the gospel in a situation where it looks as if it is appropriate, is a great thing to do, whther I consider the people friends or jsut met them.  As stated before, if done with the right attitude, its a great way to get to know someone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
It is rather presumptuous of some Christians to think that public prayers and preaching, to those who haven't asked to hear the word, will make the non-believer drink of the spirit of Christ.

<br>
**sratches head**  Well, I didn't see the &quot;some&quot; part top be honest.  Or the fact that its these same Chrsitians who are arrogant.  My mistake and I apologize for that part.  Please forgive me my mistake.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes, yes, and you are not a very forgiving person, Lukaria.

<br>
Actually, I am a forgiving person.  I forgave you long ago.  You forgive for yourself and because God forgave us, not because you &quot;feel&quot; like forgiving someone.  When I forgave you, I didn't want to, but I did.  It was the right step in the right direction and enables me to objectively view your points without becoming personally involved.<br>
<br>
However, I didn't mention your previous posts to me inorder to &quot;throw it in your face&quot; Lurikeen.  If you read carefully, I wrote it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> those very posts</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that make it hard for me to believe that you preach truth and love, as you stated in this thread.  Not impossible to believe, of course.  Just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> personally<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  difficult.<br>
<br>
I will say, Lurikeen, you did not apologize in game to me, nor do I recall it in the board.  <br>
<br>
If you did on the board, I did NOT read that post, and therefore I now accept your apology and thank you for your maturity.  In game, there was a promise of no further flames, but no apology.<br>
<br>
That aside, thats not whats important here to me.<br>
<br>
What is important is that I obviously upset you.<br>
<br>
If my bringing up your past upset you, then I do apologize.  As stated, I did it to clarify why I had a struggle with your statement, not to belittle you.  <br>
<br>
You should know me better than that, Lurikeen.  I may mess things up when I write, but I am very rarely intentionally rude or mean.  <br>
<br>
You know how important it is to me that I represent Christ appropriately, and knowing that, in all the posts between the two of us, can you honestly say I'd pick this one to attack you?  Perhaps a lesser person might do that.  Not I.  It was not intentional.  So, again, accept my apology please.<br>
<br>
I certainly hope you will respond to my posts in the future, and not allow this miscommunication to leave you witha  bad tast in your mouth.  I admit when I am wrong, but again, in this case, I did nothing intentional.  (Ok I think I said that enough times now).<br>
<br>
If you are upset though, well, that means you MUST have changed in some way!  Growth and change are good.<br>
<br>
Ok signing off now.  I am late to a meeting.  I certainly will look back and hope to see an acceptance to my apology.  If not, at least you know it wasn't intentional, and I wish you the best of luck.<br>

<br>
Apology accepted.<br>
<br>

<br>
I haven't changed. My other personality is on drugs now and can't speak.<br>

He/she who has ears to hear let them listen. :)<br>
<br>
<i>"This is a generality, and you are lumping together people here. You are saying anyone who preaches any type of faith message without first getting your express permission and/or becoming a friend - are all overbearing individuals? Is this correct?"</i><br>
<br>
No. That is wrong. Go back and read my entire posting. I am referring to <b>SOME Christians</b>.<br>
<br>
<i>"Perhaps a better way to state is this: From your comments both now and in the past, I personally have deduced that you immediately close your mind to others messages of faith, especially if they are Christians."</i><br>
<br>
Wrong again. I don't close my mind to other messages of faith. In fact, while you have been away I have had excellent discussions with Brutas, Quath, and Rheaton to name three. In my personal life (which is really none of your concern) I have many friends of many faiths.<br>
<br>
<i>"I believe my faith is the truth with a capital "T" and I certainly state it that way. In this case, according to your definition, I would now be an arrogant ass. Now, is this correct or not?"</i><br>
<br>
Wrong again. Go back and read my definition. On second thought let me provide it again... 'What I find arrogant is offering views as "the Truth" (with a capital T) when not asked.' Obviously, in a forum such as this we are offering our opinions in response to questions and comments posted by others. I am referring to "vocalization" of beliefs to people who have not <i>consented</i> to hear the words. You see, the difference is that I can skip your postings here altogether. I can simply not read this forum at all if I choose, but I can't <i>simply</i> change the channel if I meet you in the Senate chambers as a peer. I can't simply avoid you if you are my school's principle (if I were in school) and you are praying over the PA system. If you are on the street corner blaring your message through a bull horn while I am trying to do my shopping in a public market, I can't just walk away.<br>
<br>
<i>"Also, from your comments both now and in the past, I have personally deduced that you will not extend the courtesy of listening to a public prayer of anyfaith, especially Christian, because of the above beforementioned decision of refusal."</i><br>

Lukaria, I am chuckling because you really haven't a clue as to what <b>I</b> believe or would do. *sigh* I spoke at a Western Baptist church in Des Moines, Washington a couple years ago. They wanted to hear the views of an atheist and recieved my number from an organization I belong to, called me and asked for me to speak; which I did. I truly respected that church's pastor. I did a full hour of Q & A about "weak atheism". Not only did I know there would be prayers there, I was prayed for and expected it. Not that it matters, but I also attend a Unitarian Church and practice Chan Buddhism. What I adomantly speak against is the sort of doctrine that lacks tolerance. I make no apologies that you dislike reading my very strong opinions against religious discrimination and against Evangelical Christianity.<br>
<br>
<i>"When I forgave you, I didn't want to, but I did. It was the right step in the right direction and enables me to objectively view your points without becoming personally involved."</i><br>
<br>
When I forgive it is because I want too and it is the right thing to do when some one apologises, period. I am sorry you forgot my apologies to you, but just because you can't recall the apologies doesn't mean they didn't happen. Recall this apology on 12/01/01 under "Do You Believe in God"... <br>
<br>
<i>"Yes, you are correct to some extent. I apologize Lukaria. You are not deserving my flames."</i><br>
<br>
And, I did contact you in game and apologise. That is the sort of person I am. When I know I am wrong I can admit it and do my best to make what wrongs I have done right. Apologies are not cheap for me, and when I make them I don't forget.<br>
<br>
<i>" If you read carefully, I wrote it is those very posts that make it hard for me to believe that you preach truth and love, as you stated in this thread. Not impossible to believe, of course. Just personally difficult."</i><br>
<br>
Truth is Lukaria, what you personally find difficult about who I am as a real person means jack sqaut to me. When we are exchanging ideas in a written medium such as this we need to pay close attention and give each person the benefit of the doubt. I can recollect that when I was flaming you, it was more often due to the fact that you would not stick to a context and would not give people the benefit of the doubt.<br>
<br>
Frustration arises when people can't accept written words at face value, or at least be intellectually honest and ask questions. While you have been away Rheaton, Brutas, Maeri, Triff, myself and others have had far reaching intellectual (and personal) discussions because of the "give and take". Part of the give and take is dropping the accusatory tone you jumped into this with. There really is no need to make this any more personal than the exchange of opinions.<br>
<br>
Good day.<br>

Unfortunatly for those who don't share either of these beliefs, it comes across as little different from spam in my email box, or people who on meeting me immediately try to get me to join some pyramid marketting scheme. I can keep saying &quot;Sorry, I'm not interested in your mortage rates/religion/heath products/pornography&quot;, and I'll keep getting people telling me about it.<br>
<br>
Not believing in a God, I don't feel I owe any such entity the responsibility of converting people to my belief in His non-existance. And whilst I think that not believing in God is actually better for most people, I chose to respect others by not attacking their system of belief. I tend to separate morality from religious (non-)belief, and am much more inclined to try to talk people round to my views on morality, though still unlikely to do so unprovoked or unasked.<br>

Schools may not refuse to teach evolutionary theory in order to avoid giving offense to religion nor may they circumvent these rules by labeling as science an article of religious faith. Public schools must not teach as scientific fact or theory any religious doctrine, including &quot;creationism,&quot; although any genuinely scientific evidence for or against any explanation of life may be taught.

<br>
My comments did include questions that required an answer personally from you, therefore I believe I was being intellectually honest.  You seem to think that I am accusing, but I am not.  /shrug  Instead, I am presenting what I &quot;know&quot; of you from this thread and others, and then asking if that assessment is correct or not.  Several times in this particular post, you answered questions clarifying your beliefs, and informing me where I had deduced incorrectly.  That is what I asked.  I have done the same in return, though often you argue that I am &quot;one way&quot; because of something I said in a post.  For an example, a past discussion regarding moral values.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your personal perception of my posts, I really do not attempt to be accusatory, as you put it.  I do get quite passionate about my beliefs, perhaps that is what you see in my posts.  <br>

Really, Lurikeen.  Like I said, maybe you did do it on the boards.  I stopped reading these boards because it was taking too much of my time and becoming nothing but a frustration for me. /shrug.  As stated, if I missed it, I accept it now.<br>
<br>
As for in game.  I do differ opinion.  What you said was not even close to an apology in my book.  However, we can move on.  I have accepted your apology publicly now, and really, it matters not whether I get an apology in game from you or not, as you've given one here.<br>
<br>
On the subject of forgiveness, you forgive as an act, not a feeling, thats my point.  Many times I am angry and do not wish to forgive someone, yet I still do it consciously.  Have you ever been angry at someone and forgiven them - even when they never apologized for what they did to you?  That is what I am talking about here.  The act of forgiveness which is then followed by experiencing the forgiveness.  Not the other way around.  <br>
<br>
As for it being the right thing to do, yes I agree it is the right thing to do.  I would like to know why you think it is &quot;right&quot; to forgive though.  Just your opinion on that.  <br>

Its really this entire second half of your post that puts us at odds so often, Lurikeen.  <br>
<br>
I clarified that so that you would understand why I wrote what I did, because I had obviously upset you.  What I want to know is what purpose it serves for you to send pointy little jabs about how worthless my opinion is to you.  If its meaningless, then why did you care in the first place what I thought about your character, preaching love and truth?  <br>
<br>
Reading carefully, and giving you the benefit of the doubt, these comments still come across in this manner.  <br>
<br>
Well, **sigh**<br>
<br>
This is really why I stopped responding in the first place.  <br>
<br>
An exchange of ideas is wonderful, and I enjoyed them immensely.  Thanks for all the interesting posts, those that made them.  Or for the differing of opinion.  It is always wonderful to read what someone else is thinking, especially when it is well thought out and clearly written.<br>
<br>
Good information there on your graphs, Maeri, thanks for their inclusion.  I found them interesting.<br>
<br>
As always, never spell checked, not grammatically checked, no double reading, and never an intention to flame.  if it sounds that way, I didn't write it very well.  After all, I'm only human.<br>

Keep the faith.<br>

I would like to share my point of view on this hypocritical evangelist stuffage.  Lukaria, its nice that you are making an attempt to share your thoughts and feelings on such a passionate subject.  I have bad news however, we are ALL hypocrits!!  Though Lurikeen has never stated such, I am certain he agrees.  Seeing as though he does, You(a hypocrit) will not be telling him what to think or feel.  He wishes to find out for himself.  Lurikeen seeks truth and love.  That is admirable and I believe he seeks it a hell ( no pun intended you hell bound athiest you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) of a lot more than 99% of people.  <br>
<br>
By 'insisting' your view instead of 'Sharing', you are not exemplifying love (instead, you expemplify selfishness which is a form of lust).  You might think you are professing truth, but in this case, your passion does not come across in a 'caring way'.  You are offensive towards him and lash out when he does not agree with you.  <br>
<br>
Your motive is for 'turning' Lurikeen towards Christianity is selfish.  You are not sharing at all.  Your goal seems to be towards  1.) convincing someone of the truth so you can be 'recognized' by God   2.)  convincing someone of the truth so you can convince yourself.  <br>
<br>
Lukaria, if you are seeking truth and love, be careful not to be distracted by the need for recognition.  We all need it, that is true.  The truth f'cking hurts, thats no lie.  I believe that you are sharing, but have to understand that you can't talk to somone about something so passionate and expect that person to understand your every underlying meaning as if he can read your mind or has lived next door to you for his whole life.  <br>
<br>
Sorry I am criticizing you.  Again, I do admire your passion and respect your knowledge of the Bible.  Please don't take my comments to the extreme.  I believe you when you say that you have a strong relationship with God.  The main thing I wanted to point out was that we are ALL hypocrits, even the most adhering Christian.  If you know that God loves everyone equally, then you know that it doesn't matter if you do a good deed or a bad one (As far as conditions for God's love).  God loves the rapists and murderers in prisons as much as He loves you.  (God is not a club, institution or nation) <br>
<br>
It also doesn't matter 'how much you know about God'.  God loves the mentally handicapped as much as he loves the genius' of the world.  <br>
<br>
I also have a selfish motive Lukaria, I like Lurikeen, when my corpse rots and every other physical embodiment is gone, I want to chill with people like Lurikeen.  But it is arrogant of me to even imagine that I could guess at his post-physical fate.  It is also in my nature and liking to analyze and solve psycho-social issues.  Social sciences is my 'bag'.  It is also however, arrogant of me to believe that I can 'help' Lurikeen with his 'disease'.  It is arrogant for me to assume that he has the HIV of spirituality.  There is one thing that has value for my 'reason' for desiring that Lurikeen realize that he has a friend in God.  That reason, is the reality that there is no 'reason' for love and needs not be a reason for love.  Through 99% of the selfish bullshit that I &quot;share&quot; with Lurikeen, there is that one thing that outweighs it all, love.<br>
<br>
I don't give a f'cking sh!t what anybody thinks, love is beyond reason and thank God for that.  Oh thats right, you don't 'need' to, its free.  <br>
<br>
Mabye, just mabye, being 'saved' doesn't mean you know all the answers.  Unfortunately, the truth hurts like a bitch and life offers no cheats codes or spawned loot.  <br>
<br>
Stop trying to change Lurikeen, there is nothing wrong with him and if there was, it would be equal to the wrongs of you.  <br>
<br>
-As a side, I'm curious Lukaria, are you a female?  It is common knowledge that women (because of their will and nature to socialize individuals; a 'bringing together' of sorts) try to 'change' men.  It is meant in love for the most part, but can be Extremely offensive when men deal with passionate issues (which spirituality can be).  Think of a man as a Huge Grizzly Bear in a cave when dealing with certain issues.  You don't just walk in without being invited.  And BTW, that invitation takes A LOT longer than it does with women.

<br>
Jesus never &quot;bible-thumped&quot; that I can recall. He had work to do and He got it done. Rushing around in frenzy, angrily defending His position was not what He did.<br>
<br>
What He did do was spread the word that there is indeed one Truth, and this is what I feel is Lukaria's position. At least that is what I take of it.<br>
<br>
We do seem very much as the &quot;luke warm church&quot; the bible speaks about (hypocrisy). But at the same time, most Christians feel as though the fuse has been lit. There is a since of urgency to reach as many people as possible.<br>
<br>
Point blank: There is nothing anyone can say on this board...anything... that is going to change Lurikeen's mind in regards to God. &quot;It is not by logic that men find God&quot;. However, when someone gets the impression that another is attacking the Word, Christians obviously want to defend their own beliefs, position and reasons much as any religion or belief system would.<br>
<br>
If Christians do not like the way things are, dont blame the world. The reason I feel things are as they are is cause there obviously hasnt been enough pure demonstrations of unconditional love.<br>
<br>
Christians have a job to do themselves and that is to pray.. or fast and pray. <br>
<br>
....life is on God's time...not ours.<br>
<br>
Please answer the gender question Lukaria before you acquire the nickname &quot;Pat&quot;.<br>

Yea, I think so.  Unfortunately however, just because you are a professor doesnt mean you are good teacher.  Have you ever had a professor in college who was an absolute genius in a certain academic area, but was the worst teacher?  I imagine some people might attain a high level of status in a religious institution based on their academic skills, but probably insult people or turn them off because communicating to people on such touchy topics is an art and not a dry instructional manual; unless of course you have developed a special relationship with that person.  Im not trying to frustrate anyone from expressing his or her thoughts and feelings; rather Im suggesting humility when doing so.  It is not actually the fault of Christian religions that they seem so arrogant, its a numbers thing.<br>
<br>
 You would NEVER see a Buddhist or Hindu institution spreading their faith in such a fashion.  Why not you say, Because they would be lynched!!  They remain humble in the interest of preservation.  Circumstantially, they are good diplomats for their Religious institution.  Christian institutions however, do not have a preservation problem and are dominant, so of course, since they are on the number 1 team, they tend to do the hip-hip hooray dance.  Its a human nature thing.  This is why I dont prefer human made institutions, especially religious ones.  I dont think its bad to go to church, but it reminds me of how hypocritical we all can be.  Sometimes I would rather just focus on love rather than truth.  <br>
<br>
I think people take the bible way out of context at times.  If they dont spread the word, that Druid tree worshipper might go to hell.  I have a hard time believing God would use guilt as a motivator for increasing his manmade institution.  What a turn off!  If you dont turn him, he will go to hell and it will be your fault.  You will be a loser and that is not acceptable for my team.  How could you just let someone go to hell? You must be evil!  You have disappointed God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost and now you will drown in your own purgatory!  <br>
<br>
What a bunch of freeks!!    (Im not at all directing that towards you Lukaria)  Its a stereotype, but a very real one.  <br>

I sometimes feel that those who preach hell, fire and brimstone are those who have personal conflicts within themselves that then turn the &quot;war&quot; outwardly (to the public).<br>
<br>
This &quot;war&quot; is greatly contradicted by those who are &quot;on fire&quot; for God and want to share the good news. Its war and peace all wrapped into one message and its a hard one to swallow if your not prepared to hear it spiritually.<br>
<br>
If a message goes along the lines of &quot;Receive Jesus today and you will understand this AWESOME feeling I have inside of me!!  But if you dont your gonna go to HELL!&quot; Its a bitter-sweet message and it takes guidance and understanding to spread it. If a Christian strikes out on his own, without the consent of the Father (praying, understanding, patience), to preach the Word...he may very well cause more harm then good.<br>
<br>
The Christian message, IMO, is a powerful one... and as with all things of great power, if not handled correctly can have damaging effects.<br>

<br>
Rheaton, it is interesting to note "...a hard one to swallow if your not prepared to hear it spiritually."<br>
<br>
I can appreciate the spirituality of others even if I believe they are mistaken doctrinally. What does that mean? I am glad you asked. :)<br>
<br>
It means that "spirituality" is had by anyone that is mindfull of sacred matters. I know some Christians who would deny that persons like Gandhi were not <i><b>truly</i></b>spiritual because they were not Christians. Imagine that, if you can, Mahatma Gandhi was not spiritual because he practiced the Hindu religion! /boggle<br>
<br>
What is even more mind boggling to me is those Christians who sincerely believe people like Mahatma Gandhi will burn in hell along side with Adolph Hitler!<br>
<br>
There is a difference between believing one has the truth and being secure in one's belief. Those who are secure in their beliefs really don't try to peddle them on the street corner.<br>
<br>
Some Christians may like to think that others are not "prepared to hear... spiritually" when their message is rejected. But isn't that just attempting to place blame on the individuals who don't want to hear the message rather than on the message itself? God forbid that anyone would actually find the Christian message lacking! :) Those damn degenerate atheists, Muslims, Jews, and Hindus (to name a few) are all sad spiritual wrecks! LOL<br>
<br>
There may be an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if there were an infinite number of chances at that life, but only one path, you would still be right in wagering on a single path. However, it would be stupid to assume one's wager is better than another's. If there is here an infinity of paths to an infinitely happy life, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what <i>you stake is finite</i>. Understanding that your stake is finite against an infinity of paths should drive one to 1) not wager at all realizing that happiness in this life is the most important; 2) or wager knowing that anyone's bet, being finite, is just as good as any other. <br>
<br>
Rheaton, you have your wager at the table just as I do. I believe it is important to respect all bets on the table knowing that the other gamblers at the table are doing their best just as you are. When it come to an after life we are all really just wagering. However, we don't have to bet on happiness now. We can just have it. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 808<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/10/02 8:14:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=109>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> I meant to write the following: "I know some Christians who would deny that persons like Gandhi were <i><b>truly</b></i> spiritual because they were not Christians."<br>
