This is sort of a &quot;Meantime, back at the monastery&quot; kind of post.<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
 Panting with exertion, Zariel lashed out again and again. She landed two punches  on her opponent, then a round kick, following it with her newly-learned (but impressive) Tiger Claw. &quot;Die!&quot; she panted. &quot;Die already!&quot; Her opponent leered back at her, laughing mockingly, not even sweating. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't mean that,&quot; he told her, his voice as smooth and teasing as his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;DIE! I hate you, I hate you! You betrayed me!&quot; she screamed back. Her blows were all over the place, and every one missed him. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't mean that, either, little one. Come to me now,&quot; he said. &quot;Come to my arms....&quot; He dodged her next few blows. Exhaustion was making her careless, but if  she stopped, he would have her. &quot;Come to me, stop fighting it. I love you more than anyone ever has...more than anyone ever will. And you love me, you always have.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; she screamed. &quot;I don't love you!&quot; It was all she could do to avoid his attacks, as he went on the offensive. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you do, little one, Zarry, Sister of the Fist.&quot; His smiling face was a twisted  parody of love and caring. She knew something horrible lay behind his eyes. She looked away, could not meet his eyes, the eyes so similar to the ones she loved most  in the world. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't call me that! Any of that -- you aren't allowed!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't tell me what I can't do!&quot; his voice rose, and now he was angry. So angry.  &quot;Bad girl!&quot; No, she thought, no, that's wrong!  I'm good, I'm the good one! Her opponent continued to berate her.  &quot;You never stopped being weak! You never stopped misbehaving! You never learned control!  And now you will be punished! You dare to call yourself a monk? I laugh at you, I spit on you....&quot; His face twisted horribly as he spat what seemed like venom at her. It burned her skin where it touched her. She stumbled backwards, tripped over a root and fell. To her horror, she began to cry. She pulled herself to her feet and tried to run,<br>
but  her ankle hurt and she moved so slowly, as though running in water. And she could hear him behind her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look at you, you're like a scared little animal!&quot; he said, voice full of scorn. Then again, soft and enticing, &quot;Come to me, let me heal your wounds, little Zarry.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; she whimpered, but she was in his arms. &quot;No, I don't want you to! Leave me alone, leave me alone!&quot; He was crushing her, crushing her; her ribs began to ache.  &quot;Stop, you're hurting me...stop, please....&quot; Every breath was agony as she begged for her life. &quot;Please, stop, I beg you.&quot; She could feel her ribs begin to splinter. &quot;Stop!  Please! Please, stop!&quot; And with the last of her breath -- &quot;ARI! NOOOOOOO!&quot; <br>
<br>
And she awoke, shivering, crying, on her pallet on the floor of her cell, her room at the monastary. There was a knocking at the door, a frantic pounding. &quot;Zariel!  Zariel, let us in, or I'm coming in!&quot; <br>
<br>
She didn't have enough breath to say &quot;Come in,&quot; so she was glad for the threat.  She was still sobbing and screaming from the nightmare, although she knew it was but another dream. <br>
<br>
The door flew open. &quot;Zariel! What's wrong?&quot; It seemed half the monastary was there, wide awake. Brother Cyril was gazing at her in astonishment. Brother Kosta hurried into the room and dropped to his knees, putting a comforting an arm about her shoulders and helping her to sit up. &quot;It's all right, sister, it's all right. It was just a dream, just a bad dream,&quot; he assured her. <br>
<br>
As her sobs began to die away, Brother Aganerral said, his tone one of concern, &quot;Another one, Zarry?&quot;  Zariel nodded mutely. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand.&quot; Brother Cyril's new student, Devotee Chide, entered the room. &quot;What's wrong, sister?&quot; Chide too dropped to the floor, taking one of Zariel's hands. &quot;You're cold as ice,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;and you look like you've been fighting demons! This is all from a dream?&quot; She began to rub Zariel's hands betweenher own, as Zariel slumped, exhausted from her dream battle. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's your brother again, isn't it?&quot; asked Kosta, a worried look in his eye. &quot;I heard you scream his name.&quot; Zariel looked down at her lap in misery. <br>
<br>
&quot;I, too, heard you call out for Arikel,&quot; Cyril confirmed. He looked around, taking charge of the situation. &quot;Zariel's room isn't big enough for all of us. Why don't we adjourn to the kitchen? You could use some tea, sister, and so could I.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Me, too,&quot; chimed in Kosta and Chide simultaneously. Chide kept hold of Zariel's right hand as Kosta helped her to her feet. &quot;I love tea,&quot; he said. Zariel attempted to smile at them and failed miserably, bursting into tears again. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so weak, so weak,&quot; she repeated as they hurried her downstairs to the monastery's kitchen. &quot;I can't fight him anymore.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Poor Sister,&quot; said Aganerral kindly. &quot;You seem to wind up crying on the floor more than anyone I know!&quot; Zariel did manage a weak, teary smile at this good-natured remark. <br>
<br>
&quot;So I've observed myself,&quot; she said, voice wobbling. Four of the five monks sat down at the plain wooden kitchen table, while Kosta began to prepare the tea. Then, before she lost her nerve, Zariel told them about the dream, so like the others she'd had, every night since her brother had joined the evil Cimmerii. Her worried gaze took in Brother Cyril's equally troubled glance, Brother Aganerral's concerned expression, Brother Kosta's suspicious face, and Chide's open confusion. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ari...that's Arikel? Our Brother? The former guildleader?&quot; Chide asked the room in general. Everyone nodded. <br>
<br>
&quot;But he's Zariel's brother by birth, as well, and was her mentor here at the monastery, and since before the Fist of the Five Winds was formed,&quot; Cyril informed the Devotee.  He then looked thoughtfully at Zariel where she sat, knees to her chin, arms wrapped around herself. She looked very young, and he remembered she was just 17, only a year older than Chide. &quot;Zarry,&quot; he hazarded, &quot;have you thought about turning to Quellios about this?&quot; <br>
<br>
Zariel shook her head vehemently. &quot;No! The gods just confuse me. If they exist, they are cruel -- they took my parents and now my brother. I don't believe in them, anyway, and if I did I wouldn't ask them for help!&quot; Cyril sighed softly. He knew Quellios would help Zariel to attain a sense of calm, but he also respected her <br>
feelings. &quot;Brother Masakato understands,&quot; said Zariel stubbornly. Cyril only nodded, for he understood too. <br>
<br>
&quot;But listen, everyone,&quot; Zariel continued, a strange excitement in her voice. &quot;I know what I need to do. What these dreams are telling me.&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;I need to face Ari.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Sister, no!&quot; exclaimed Cyril. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; cried Kosta. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're not ready,&quot; stated Aganerral. <br>
<br>
And, &quot;Good idea,&quot; said Chide cheerfully. <br>
<br>
All faces turned to Chide. &quot;Good idea?&quot; they echoed. <br>
<br>
Chide nodded emphatically. &quot;You're really angry, Sister,&quot; she said, &quot;aren't you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Zariel. &quot;He betrayed me. I loved and trusted him my whole life, and he has hurt and abandoned me in return. He said he would never do that, he swore that to me again and again, ever since our parents died. But he lied. He left me and joined...the Cimmerii. He didn't have to! Setis didn't! Laocoon didn't!&quot; Zariel grew closer to hysterics with each sentence. Cyril opened his mouth to explain again, how it wasn't Arikel's fault, how the Cimerii had corrupted and stolen him. But he caught Kosta shooting him a &quot;Not now, Brother, not now,&quot; look, and remained quiet. <br>
<br>
Aganerral, meanwhile, was nodding his head. &quot;I think I see what you're saying, Chide,&quot; he said to the young woman. He got up to help Kosta bring over the mugs of hot tea. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I know about anger, and I bet she can use it,&quot; Chide explained. &quot;You aren't ready to fight him, but you do need to face him and force him to explain himself, right?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Right,&quot; Zariel affirmed. <br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't help to tell you how it wasn't his fault; you're still going to feel like it was, right?&quot; asked Chide. Zariel nodded as she took a sip of tea. &quot;What I say is, the best defense is a good offence! It might be one of us next...how can we stop them? But you can't defeat Arikel, Zarry, and no matter what he's done to you, you still love him.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, I --&quot; Zariel began to disagree. <br>
<br>
&quot;Zarry,&quot; said the other four together, obviously not believing her. <br>
<br>
&quot;All right, I do still love him,&quot; Zariel admitted grudgingly. &quot;A lot. But I'm also angry enough to die!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, don't die,&quot; advised Kosta gently. &quot;It's not good for the constitution.&quot; Everyone smiled at that; Aganerral even laughed. &quot;But I think I see where Chide's going. You need to face him -- and find out if there's a way to save him. If there's any of 'Ari' left in there, or if he's all 'Evil Arikel' now.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I think so,&quot; Zariel agreed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Cyril, &quot;I think it's a bad idea. Please, Chide, Brother Aganerral, Brother Kosta, don't encourage her!&quot; He turned to face Zariel, concern on his face. &quot;Zarry, I loved your brother too. He was my dearest companion for a long time. But he has changed so much...I don't think you should face him under any circumstances.  What  he has become is not his fault, but he will not spare you -- or your feelings.&quot;  Cyril winced in remembered pain. <br>
<br>
&quot;I, too, am against it, Brother Cyril,&quot; Kosta said. &quot;But you seem determined, Sister.  If you must face him, you must face him.... You're going to need help, though.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; Zariel said. &quot;He's still got a lot of power over me. I'd rather die than become evil, but I don't know if he'd give me the choice. But what kind of help is there?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Aganerral, &quot;there's us. We are your family too, you know.&quot; He smiled down at the grateful look on Zariel's face; she was nearly crying again. &quot;And we'll just have to make sure he doesn't get the chance! Now come on,&quot; said the order-driven Justicar. &quot;Let's get to work on a plan!&quot; <br>
<br>
There was a slight frown on Cyril's face as he absent-mindedly put a brotherly arm around Zariel's shoulders. Chide looked up and winked at the older girl; Zariel blushed.   As he was listening intently to Aganerral, Cyril failed to notice the two girls' exchange. <br>
<br>
The monks bent their heads towards Aganerral as he began to outline a plan, and even Cyril had to smile. Zariel realized she probably wouldn't have to fight Arikel, and her shoulders sagged with relief. Chide nodded intently, occaisonally making noises of agreement. Kosta was silent until Aganerral was finished, only then adding a few ideas of his own. Finally, all of those present were satisfied. <br>
<br>
&quot;Brother Aganerral, you're brilliant,&quot; said Zariel. &quot;What a plan!&quot; The five monks smiled at each other. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think,&quot; said Cyril, &quot;that I will have to call a guild meeting. And soon.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
