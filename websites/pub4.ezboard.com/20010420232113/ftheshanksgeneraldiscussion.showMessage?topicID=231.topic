His objective, a fine spear wrought in the ancient past and said to have been forged in magic, was said to be had from a band of gypsies that made the hellish regions of the Lavastorm mountains, just on the other side of the wood.  But before the spear would be his, he would have to make the most perilous journey of his life.<br>
<br>
A pointy-eared sub-human was holding forth in the gorge with a gargantuan beast.  &quot;Two hundred and forty platinum, right,&quot; the elf asked.  Plumber chuckled inwardly to himself. The elves would never learn.  How long, he wondered, would it be before the ogre had decided that he had had enough of the elf's prattle, and permanently put an end to it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Such is the way of sub-humans,&quot; he thought, &quot;fools every one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Giving those who shared the gorge with him no further thought, Plumber crept forward, through the serpentine passageway that lead to the forest.  Suddenly, he felt eyes upon him.  The ogre, his eyes obviously gifted by foul familiar spirits, had turned to follow him with his gaze.  Without hesitation, Plumber lunged forward, leaving the surprised shouts of the elf and his behemoth companion behind.  Quickly Plumber gained the forest, diving into the underbrush for cover.<br>
<br>
But the ogre had followed him.  &quot;Barbarian in duh woods,&quot; it shouted in it's gutteral corruption of the common tounge, &quot;look like he shaman.&quot;<br>
<br>
Plumber snorted inwardly at the beast's ignorance, knowing that the advantage was still his.  His assailant had seen him, but he had been lost, and Plumber was still an unkown quantity to the evil denizens of the wood.<br>
<br>
From brush to bole, Plumber crept onward, steadily the cries of the ogre and those answering him grew faint.  Presently, movement in a clearing ahead caught his eye, freezing him in his place.  A blue-skin mage stood regarding a camp of halflings.  Plumber considered his options.  The mage did not seem powerful enough to Plumber to be able to magically discern his presence, but it could still have had such magics wrought on him by others, and although he seemed weak, he had a servant creature made of dirt and rock at his command.  Plumber had seen such creatures sink a man's feet in the ground, and if that happened, it would dispel the spirit that Nerasow had asked to guide him.  Holding his breath, Plumber crept past the mage and his pet, leaving them still regarding the halfings, just as they were when he first saw them.<br>
<br>
&quot;To arms, To arms!&quot;  A shout went up in the woods.  &quot;Enemies at the pyramid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Plumber thanked whatever spirits of his ancestors were watching over him this night.  A more perfect distraction could not have been planned.  With an invading party of Elves occupying the attentions of the inhabitants of the forest, Plumber reached the foothills of the Lavastorm Mountains without further incident.<br>
<br>
Cautious still, but this time wary of the elementals and imps that roamed the place without hinderance, Plumber made his way to the gypsie camp.  To his dismay, however, it had all been for naught.  The merchant did indeed have the spear that Plumber sought, but the price was more platinum than Plumber had ever had in his young life.  Briefly Plumber considered stealing the spear, but just as quickly he discarded the idea.  He was far from certain that he would be able to remove the prize from under so watchful a gaze.  With a sigh of disappointment tempered with pride in having made such a difficult trek, Plumber prepared for his return journey.<br>
<br>
Plumbers return was much less eventful.  The marauding elves were causing quite a stir, and he saw no dark elves on his way back....<br>
<br>
Until he was nearly free of the Black Wood.<br>
<br>
There, standing in the path between Plumber and the gorge leading out of the forest was an dark elven maiden.  Strange she seemed to his eyes, and beautiful as well.  Plumber shook his head, ridding them of such thoughts.  Likely, he reminded himself, she would as soon rip his heart from his chest as smile at him.  From her dress, Plumber guessed her to be a sorcerer of some sort, and she surely seemed to be of power enough to make an end of his short life.  Although she had turned away from him, Plumber could not be sure that she would not see him when he left the cover of the trees for the relative openness of the gorge.  Plumber grinned to himself when he realized that Bolness was the only course of action available to him.<br>
<br>
With a mighty YAUP Plumber sprang from the trees, running swift and sure toward the sorceress.  *BONK*  Plumber brought the butt of his spear down on the head of the surprised elf.  Without missing a step, Plumber ran headlong into the gorge, leaving the sounds of the humiliated sorceress' casting behind him.<br>
<br>
&quot;WAAAAAAAAAAHHHHOOOOOOOIIIEEEEEE!!!!!&quot; shouted the young rake.<br>
<br>
Onward Plumber charged through the gorge, jumping and counting coup on two more of the surprised devils before gaining the open ground of the commonlands.  These did not even attempt to stay him, so surprised they were but this screaming barbarin.<br>
<br>
Plumber did not stop running until he had reached the gates of Freeport, where he found Nerasow and Majestyk, his kinsmen.  Excitedly he related his story to them, then in disappointment told them of the failure of his quest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Nerasow proudly, &quot; at least you have a tale to tell 'round the fire.&quot;<br>

Venturing to the Gypsy camp in the Lavastorm mountains is no small feat.<br>
<br>
The fact that you did not come back with the spear you quested for, does not diminish the act.<br>
<br>
If you had gone with the nearly 70pp that is demanded by the gypsies for that fine weapon, you'd be as crazy as I thought you were when you asked me to join you.<br>
<br>
I too once sought the spear and trekked thru the Nektulos forest to reach Lavastorm.  I did not succeed.  Little rat faced drows detected me and drew the guards attention to me.<br>
<br>
A bit of advice to ye.  There be a weapon out there called a Dragoon Dirk.  It does an equal amount of damge and is a little faster than the spear.  Add to that dexterity and magical resistance bonuses.  It can be had for near the price of that spear and without the trek thru Nektulos.<br>
<br>
It is worth the trouble of constantly auctioning for it until you find someone willing to part with one.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we can find a master of the magical arts to transport a group of us to the Lavastorm mountains.  Is this possible?  I have seen a druids circle there.  Then we could try to make our way to the gypsy camp from there.</font><P><html>

<br>
I spent an afternoon once, on a solo raid vs. the parties in Lavastorm.  Seems the darks let down their guard in that zone and are quite surprised when attacked.  I even zoned into Najena and caused a little mayhem among the subhumans healing at the zone.  Wasn't able to finish any off, but then I never fell myself.  Could be fun to bring in a full party of Shanks and see what unfolds.  The level range is about right.  <br>
<br>
I agree that I would save for a DD Plumb, but if you decide to go for the combine, I am willing to accompany you.  You may even wish me to carry the plat, since I have a good shot at gating out if overmatched.  <br>

We made the run without incident, and I obtained my prize.<br>
  It may be wise, however to use the bind/gate idea in obtaining a spear for Drasnian, however.  Once we gathered the funds necessary to get a spear for him, the devils had awakened from their slumber, and on 2 occaision Thykrys was forced to gate back to Freeport, lest the savings of all three of us be taken as booty by a horde of blue-skinned devils.<br>
