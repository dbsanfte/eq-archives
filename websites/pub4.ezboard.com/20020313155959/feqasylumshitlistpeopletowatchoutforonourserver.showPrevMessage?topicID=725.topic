They then take the camp away from the other group and will not share any of the spawns.<br><br>   So, after 2 hours of this Jademist has gotten 3 levels.

I wasn't interested in continuing to play after encountering them last night (a whole 10 mins is all it took to sour my play experience).  So I camped and watched TV instead.  Gee it been ages since I watched TV. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Tried to talk to the pair and ask if they mind sharing some of the spawns with us, but it was met with silence.  So I figured they're not interested.  No problem you where there first.  I figured we can go camp something else, but eventually Jademist said he was camping raiders.  So I thought cool, we can have warrior/lo camp right?  Wrong!!! They wanted to claim both camps.  And true noone owns a camp, but I am NOT going to argue or pnp someone over a camp.  If they don't want to share, then they really don't have too.<br><br>I don't mind if you want to PL your alt or friend.  It no biggy to me and could care less, but trying to PL some place as heavily camped as HH keep and taking 2 camps (raiders and warrior/lo) is beyond my understanding.  Why not PL somewhere with one of those new exp bonuses and alot less crowded?  Besides Jademist was not in any danger with Dirtt there to heal and buff him, he should have been able to tackle yellow and red mobs for some real exp, not that blue stuff in the warrior/lo camp.  It deffinately was not for loot, since Jademist was a properly twinked out warrior.  So it had to be exp, and at 27 there are alot of places to PL at that are not crowded.<br><br>Do I think you deserve to be on the poop list for it?  No.<br><br>I was just surprised that you where up here.  It seems that the two of you were beening naughty boys to others as well yesterday.

My partner and I were camping Halv in SF.  Dirtt pops in like he just logged on.  I inform him that Halv was camped, but that he was welcome to the camp when we were done.  Dirtt tells us that he wasn't after the camp, and that he didn't need Halv.  He was red to me, so I took his word.   About 3 mins later Halv pops, in the time it took me to stand up, Dirtt had already begun to blast him.  My partner and I tried to out blast him (at the time she was 30 I was 34) but we could not keep up.  After looting Halv,  Dirtt comes over to gloat.  I asked him why he lied to and KS'd me.  He only laughed at us and told me to relax.  I tried to reason with him, he only made fun of us.  I then threatened talk to his guild about the matter.  Upon hearing that he quickly logged.<br><br> About 2 mins later Dirtt comes back.  I informed him that I was speaking with an officer of TSO about his actions.  He then claimed to have no knowledge of what he just did.   He claimed that it was his &quot;friend&quot; with whom he shares an account.   While Dirtt was blabbering about how the incident was not his fault he mentioned the names of his alts.  One of which my partner and I grouped with on a few occasions when we both played other classes (many moons ago).  Now let me make one point very clear, Dirtt DID NOT know who we are.  He was never a friend, he was just some one with whom we grouped a few times.  After speaking with the TSO officer and having a few mins. to cool off, I told the TSO officer to drop the matter and that I wouldn't pursue it as long as it was an isolated incident.<br><br>It appears that this was not an isolated incident, or that Dirtt is letting his friend on his account again.  Regardless of who is at the controls, Dirtt is the character committing these offences.<br><br>TSO was completely honorable about the whole affair.  They responded quickly to my request to speak with them, and they seemed genuinely concerned with the problem I had with one of their members.

Guilded players<br>a. Turn on logging. As much as these can be forged, etc., the guildleaders/officers can compare your log with that of others in the situation and get a better idea of what is going on.<br>b. See if the person is in a guild (he/she may be anon, so you might not know by just looking at the tag). If in a guild, do a /w all &lt;guildname&gt; or even a /guildstatus player x if anon just to be sure.<br>c. Contact a random member of the guild listed and ask for the name of the leader or an officer who is online (unless you know the guildleader or an officer). Discuss the situation. Keep logging on during the discussion so you have something to look at later if you still feel you need to post. (looking back to see if the situation was resolved as best it could be for the time being might hold of your post for a while, plus, people have selective memories. read the log again and MAKE SURE)<br>d. If the guild leaders/officers were not responsive to your request for discussion, post to their web page BEFORE POSTING HERE. If they do not have a web page, give it another day and try and contact them through tells, etc. (trying different guild members to ask for leaders/officer names for the sake of accuracy)<br>e. If for some strange reason, none of the above steps produce any results within a weeks time, continue on to step 3.<br><br>2. Unguilded players<br>a. Turn on logging (to help you write your post, if you make one. BE SURE that you were not inflaming the situation and making it worse. BE SURE that you have given the other person the benefit of a doubt)<br>b. Try and discuss the situation with the person in question. (the GMs will ask you to if you didn't)<br>b. Petition the situation with a /report of some of what the player is saying that you find offensive or unjust, or that adds strength to your reason for petitioning.<br>(instructions and general guidelines for petitioning, reporting can go here). Try and resolve the situation with the GM and person (assuming a GM shows up).<br>c. If none of this is helping, proceed to step 3.<br><br>3. Write out your post in an offline text editor and read it a few times. Sleep on it, then read it a few more times. If you still feel this person merits shitlisting, then copy and paste your post, but be sure that you are right. Reputations are a hard thing to fix, and wrongly accusing someone can hurt yours as well.<br><br><br>Ok, that's about it. A very rough draft as I'm throwing it together while at work. Run with it, or I will help you finish it, but I strongly feel we need something up there for people to look at before posting if we are going to complain about improper posting.<br><br> <p><IMG SRC=http://www.pobox.com/~hudaman/hudskel2.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=384.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=384.topic&start=41&stop=53>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showPrevMessage?topicID=384.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showNextMessage?topicID=384.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=384.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.emailToFriend?topicID=384.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.threadControl?topicID=384.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=384.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=384.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
