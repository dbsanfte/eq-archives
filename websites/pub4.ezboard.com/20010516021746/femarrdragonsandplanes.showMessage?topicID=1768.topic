<br>
The world is abuzz - thanks to a huge spew of press releases - about a &quot;philanthropic&quot; effort to &quot;cure cancer&quot;. Just<br>
          download the screen saver, which will cheerfully suck up your spare cycles and get to work eliminating the evil scourge -<br>
          actually, doing a brute-force chemical interaction model which is one teeny-tiny part of the overall effort to fight cancer.<br>
          What they forgot to mention was that running the client primarily benefits a for-profit company in Austin, TX which wants<br>
          to sell your CPU cycles to the highest bidder in exchange for some nice beads. <br>
<br>
          United Devices is running the effort. All you have to do is download their closed-source, restrictive-licensed client program and install it on<br>
          your PC (you also have to agree to their website license to even download the program, of course). You take all risks of installing the<br>
          program - if the program deletes every file on your computer, too bad. If it downloads some kiddie porn and emails fbi@fbi.gov<br>
          confessing to the crime, too bad. And I hope you don't pay for bandwidth by the byte, because their main commercial effort seems to be<br>
          stress-testing websites for Exodus. You do read those license agreements, don't you?<br>
<br>
          Here's UD's business model in a nutshell:<br>
<br>
          &quot;Get people to give us computing power and bandwidth for free and sell it to other people.&quot;<br>
<br>
          A nice gig, if you can get it. UD's primary business is selling computing cycles to corporations. As it turns out, they were having a hard<br>
          time with the first part of the business model, so they came up with a scheme to get people to install their client: we'll do philanthropic<br>
          work! And what could be more philanthropic than curing cancer?<br>
<br>
          Who else can we get on board? How about Intel? They're always willing to sponsor anything that promises to burn a lot of CPU cycles.<br>
          In fact, they're willing to put up a disgusting website that totally misuses the term &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; to achieve an alliterative buzzphrase.<br>
<br>
          So, the stage is set. Now, read through the site that UD set up for this effort. Try to find in it any mention of anything other than<br>
          philanthropy and cancer curing. You won't be able to. Why, you might even start to believe all this client does is work on curing cancer.<br>
          Now go back to UD's main web site and read through it, noting how your computer will be sold to any corporation willing to pay for it.<br>
          The task your computer runs is determined by UD, not by you.<br>
<br>
          Even the cancer research isn't philanthropic in the usual sense. Say that your machine discovers the drug that cures cancer. Who benefits?<br>
          Well, Oxford University will patent it and sell the rights to produce it at some extortionate price, the name-brand drug will be hideously<br>
          expensive, and 20 years later when the patent expires, the world will be able to afford cancer cures - shame about all those people that<br>
          died in the meantime.<br>
<br>
          That's &quot;philanthropy&quot; in the digital age - agreeing to a restrictive license and running a program which can do anything it wants with your<br>
          computer system or network including destroying it or committing crimes with it or running up your phone bill, all the while doing free<br>
          work for a for-profit corporation so that a drug company can get a patent on a life-saving drug and charge outrageous prices to pay back<br>
          the &quot;research costs&quot;.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#666666><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanotos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anotos</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Visitor</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>13</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>4/4/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#E9D756>4:30:03 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Well, if we are cutting and pasting...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Might as well get everything:<br>

Ok, as none of the slashdot editors seem to be able to do any editing here are a couple of excerpts from various faqs and information services describing how this stuff work.<br>
<br>
From <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.ud.com/vypc/cancer/faq_proj.htm">members.ud.com/vypc/cancer/faq_proj.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
Are you going to sell the results to large pharmaceutical companies?<br>
<br>
—No. The results of this study are the intellectual property of the University of Oxford and the National Foundation for Cancer Research, who will make the scientific findings of this project available to the greater scientific community.<br>
<br>
Are the results going to be made public?<br>
<br>
Yes. Prof. Graham Richards' research group, the project coordinators, will publish the results. This group originally designed the project and is currently orchestrating the study. Scientific interpretation of the results from this study will take some time. Results and scientific findings will be published in the usual manner through a peer-reviewed process. <br>
<br>
So the results are going to the National Foundation for Cancer Research and Oxford. The National Foundation for Cancer Research are not the type of body to charge for commercial development of this work<br>
<br>
From <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.ud.com/vypc/cancer/index.htm">members.ud.com/vypc/cancer/index.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
The project software cannot detect or transfer anything on your machine but project-specific information. It just allows your computer to screen molecules that may be developed into drugs to fight cancer. Each individual computer analyzes a few molecules and then sends the results back over the Internet for further research. <br>
<br>
So your computer is only allowed to scan molecules<br>
<br>
From Intels criteria for Philantropic projects<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.intel.com/cure/criteria.htm">www.intel.com/cure/criteria.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
A. 100% Philanthropic:<br>
The programs and, more specifically, workloads should be 100% philanthropic. Being a 100% philanthropic program means that that the program(s) run non-profit projects all of the time. Programs that run commercial projects &quot;from time to time&quot; are NOT considered 100% philanthropic.<br>
<br>
B. No Cost to the Public:<br>
The program should be completely &quot;free&quot; to the public. This means that there should be no cost to the public to download any of the software applications needed to run the workloads. <br>
<br>
C. Complete Disclosure to User:<br>
The programs should allow complete disclosure of information to the user about the workloads running on the user's machine (including, but not limited to, the type of data being processed), without giving away proprietary information. <br>
<br>
D. Complete Disclosure to the Public:<br>
The programs should allow all results obtained from processed workloads to be completely disclosed to the public within approximately 12 months of receiving the results. <br>
<br>
So thank you michael for allowing your cynicism and laziness in research to potentially take a lot of computing resources away from an important project. Yes it is getting attention for all the parties involved but it is not a cheap trick to steal our computer cycles for commercial interests, if you join for the cancer project then that is all you will work on<br>
<br>
So when you go home to bed tonight make sure and think about how much extra suffering your lack of editorial integrity may have caused cancer sufferers due to lost computing resources for this project. When will the slashdot editors learn that they can't just post any old crap, slashdot is not a small site where a mistake has no affect, it has a huge readership and needs to start taking some responsibility for the integrity of the stories it posts.<br>

How come if this *research* is so all fired important I'm learning about it on a *game* board???<br>
<br>
I'm a cynic, and I don't buy it.  If the professor himself wants to call me and explain how it works and while it will help, I'd be glad to help.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, why don't we keep this board to the lighthearted flames that I'm happily adjusted to.<br>
<br>
My time has been inordinately wasted by the fact that the original poster spammed this to EVERY single board available, despite knowing that each board has a specific use.  This belonged in general and no where else.<br>
<br>
Am I sympathetic to the cancer cause, of course.  I'm a skin cancer survivor.  I subscribe to a number of medical emails, texts, magazines and journals and this is the first I've heard of this.  I believe I will give the good ol NFCR a call and let them know that while this may be legitimate, the cynics among us are skeptical.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I'm reminded of a number of hoaxes, and I'm not about to invite just anyone into my computer.  Sure they can't see anything but what they want.  Unfortunately, I've heard that story before.  Wasn't true then, no way to tell if it's true now.<br>

<br>
I'm a techie, and have a very hard time putting things in simple terms but here goes:<br>
<br>
Basically this is distributed computing.  In a nutshell what they are doing is taking data and having people use their own boxes to crunch numbers, research data I take it.  This reduces overhead costs and can speed things up .. if you have X amount of people crunching data on their own boxes.. if you have say 1 million people doing that on their time, etc .. that is a lot of extra computing power that you have access to, instead of having to invest in equipment at your central location.<br>
<br>
Most of these programs work on CPU idle time (meaning they start working when you are not doing anything on your computer and most of the processor is free).  It would then take the results from your machine and send it via the Internet to wherever they are located.<br>
<br>
Pretty simple, I don't see a reason to be paranoid about it.. it's been done before - Seti at home and cracking the RSA key, etc..<br>
