Well the reason these people have to take these jobs is becuase they are the only ones avaialable to non-English speakers, becuase your average white english speaking 3rd generation male would not touch these jobs with a barge pole. If they didnt do them, noone would.<br>

I want to know... is my husband above or below average? Who knows HOW many generations have passed since his assorted great-howevermanytimes-grandparents arrived. He is white. He speaks english. Trust me, he's DEFINITELY male... and he delivers pizzas at the moment.<br>
<br>
Newsflash folks... taking a job, ANY job, just to pay for food is NOT restricted to non-english speakers. It's NOT restricted to blacks, hispanics, asian, alien, boogymonsters, or women either.<br>
<br>
Just once I'd like to see the topic of one language one country come up and someone NOT play the &quot;oh they have to work minimum wage jobs to afford food they can't afford to take time off to learn a language&quot; card. Or the &quot;if you evil white oppressors weren't keeping them down they'd learn the language&quot; or any other variant on the &quot;you're the bad guy and these poor linguistic cripples deserve pity you bad bad person&quot; theme.<br>

Of course you don't see a parallel gap between races, you live in Seattle. Last I checked, Seattle had one of the highest white majorities of any state in the country. I could be mistaken, so feel free to correct me...<br>
<br>
But regardless, the only country Seattle is close to is Canada, and since Canadians speak English as one of their official languages, I dont' think you guys are going to have a lot of trouble interpreting.<br>
<br>
Here in Texas, however, it's an entirely different ball game. Due to the ease of slipping through the border, and the vast amounts of hispanics in Texas, everything is written (nearly) as bi-lingual. Our entire culture is divided between the rampant clash between the two countries.<br>
<br>
They are teaching children Spanish in school, but for what purpose? In the United States, English is the official language, and most natives don't even speak it as well as I feel they should, so why are we wasting education time on teaching them a language that isn't even native to their country.<br>
<br>
Everyday at work, I am around several groups of people who speak little or no English. We are a UNITED nation, why should we promote this gap between cultures. I don't want to disclose an entire race based upon their culture, that's fine and dandy. I do, however, want them to be able to speak the language of the country I choose to live in.<br>
<br>
If I ever moved to another country, you can bet I would do my best to learn their language, out of courtesy both for the people of the nation, as well as for the nation itself. If the nation is so wonderful that I would want to live their above anywhere else, the least I can do is learn the official language set precedent.<br>
<br>
It is a drain on the tax dollars we put forth everyday, to interpret and provide this continuing rift between languages. It is absolutely true that we were a country founded upon immigration, and people from all nationalities and creeds. But that was ~250 years ago. I guarantee you the descendants of those fabled settling pioneers all speak English now. <br>
<br>
Times change, we are no longer a country built upon immigration, and to provide any means that prevents the bonding of us &quot;one nation, undivided&quot; is deragatory to everything we can accomplish.<br>
<br>
In my teen years, I was turned down a job at a fast food place because I wasn't bi-lingual. That's right, never mind my ability to dictate my feelings and my prowess in the english language, much less my work ethic and abilities, I didn't speak a language FOREIGN to my country, so I wasn't qualified.<br>
<br>
Languages are a beautiful thing, and help in preserving and expressing the beauty and differences each culture has to offer. I've picked up lots of spanish, french, and german both from a fascination standpoint, and an ability standpoint. But as an American citizen, whether legally or not, it is our duty to speak and write the language set forward by our government, and everytime you ignore or promote any argument to allow a language barrier to exist, you promote all of the negatives with a culture gap. Racism, nationalism, distrust, and miscommunication.<br>
<br>
Think about it.<br>

<br>
Like I said, I *am* the gap, being an American raised immigrant who'll never be fully accepted by Americans nor the Chinese.  Guess that's why I got thrown in therapy when I was a teen /boggle.<br>
<br>
Until each and every one of you has gone to try to make a living for yourself in a foreign country, you will never know where I'm coming from.  I'm not Aryan enough for the Americans just on the basis of what I eat and how I look, yet I'm always going to be too Americanized for those back in my homeland.  For most immigrants, we have no homeland.  I have absolutely no inkling of patriotism in me.  I get treated like I'm a second rate human being by Americans (Political Correctness ring a bell?) and by those who share my ethnic heritage (proud, pompous, selfish American brats is what we get called).  Most of you who know me know that I'm not politically minded.  I could give two sh!ts about the feminist revolution or equal opportunity.  Why?  Because it's those very fights and causes that have made my life uneasy.  Glory to the cause.  Well, you know what?  Fvck the cause because if you look at all your comments, the cause has lost.<br>
<br>
Trust me people, it's still a white man's world.  Your precious Anglicized bubble hasn't been burst.  My house was subject to arson in 1989 in a suburb in Los Angeles because we were the wrong skin color.  My family has suffered rape by white employers, and I lost my childhood when my mother spent 10 years of her life fighting appeal after appeal because the American courts accepted the bribes from the mighty white corporation to cover up the incidents.  So, stfu and rest happy because it's still your world out there.  It never stopped being your world.  I would know, because I'm still knocking on the door asking to be let in.<br>
<br>
Learn some @#%$ appreciation, for Christ's sake.  You all live in the best frikkin country in the world and you still have something to complain about?  Get off your azzes and travel and get a good look at how things are elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I see a whole lot of you whining about a whole lot of nothing.  Have a problem with legal documents written in Spanish?  Well, fvck, a lot of you Americans born and raised on U.S. soil can't even read a legal document without the help of a paralegal or attorney.  It's called legal 'jargon' for a reason.  So until each and every American can read legal documents a-okay all by themselves and completely comprehend them without outside help, I don't see why a copy written in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, etc., is such a problem.  There's a word called hypocrisy I think a lot of you should look up.  My family speaks English perfectly fine but when we're going to pen our signature down on something legally binding, I'd sure as hell like for them to read it in a language they fully comprehend.  Just because someone wants a copy of a document in another language is no fvcking indication they can't speak conversational English.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the negativity, Nekiah, trust me it wasn't directed at you.<br>
<br>
So, basically, stfu because it's still your own @#%$ country.  Martin Luther King, Jr. and the other great activists may have made a dent, but look over your posts carefully and you'll see just as I have that many of his teachings have been lost.  <br>
<br>
Nobody is owed anything.  Immigrants don't owe anything to you and you don't owe anything to them.  Want the cultural gap to lessen?  How about you start changing your attitude about foreigners, first?  Instead of wondering how you should treat them, just go ahead and treat them like a normal human being.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of you lose sight that we are humans.  We're not aliens.  If you all can't pick up a language easily then it's tough for us, as well.  You can't stand criticism well?  Newsflash, not many people can, and your cold, unfeeling criticism based on superficial flaws is demeaning and spiteful.  I can't explain to you how much it hurts me as a person when I see people like you go off about rants like this.  It hurts me because it reassures me mainstream America still thinks I don't belong here, even though I've lived all but one year of my life in America.  All these comments do is assure me that the same a$$holes who tried to wreck my family's life (/wave Prudential Insurance, Co.) are still alive in mainstream America.  Their spirit lives on in every angry, bigotted, racist rant.<br>
<br>
Welcome to the land of the free, now, if you'll step off the boat, there's a hot cowbrand waiting for you to mark you as a second rate citizen and someone who doesn't belong here.  I have mine on my arm, want to see it?  Everytime you guys go off about an inane topic like this, I get another one, and so does every other immigrant who's worked hard to make a living here, only to find citizenship is a far cry from acceptance.<br>
<br>
Think this isn't what you're doing now?  Look again.  *We* make you miserable because we don't speak your language to the degree of fluency *you* prefer.  *We* have been like mice infiltrating your white suburbs, and that makes *you* uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry I wasn't born the right skin color or in the right country and I'm sorry my people don't speak enough English to make you all feel comfortable living your happy little carefree no-worries-no-poverty-there-is-always-welfare lives.  Hell, I'm sorry I was even born, because the truth is, many people just like you have made me wish I wasn't born at all throughout my life, because the pain felt from being hated or demeaned purely based on skin color and ethnicity hurts a person to their core.  The entire soul cries when you demean a person on superficial values.  Language, in the end, is just a means of communication.  I speak English.  What does that really tell you about a person?  Nothing.<br>
<br>
When you all feel like finally treating people like human beings no different than yourselves, only then will the cultural gap lessen.  It's only through patience, compassion, and understanding that this goal will be accomplished.  But until *you* are willing to let go of the hate, the prejudice (thinking immigrants don't speak a lick of English just because they'd like a copy of a legal document in another language is pretty damn shallow), and the overall selfish behavior (that you're owed something by others, such as comfort from hearing only English), this isn't going anywhere.<br>
<br>
So, yes, it's true.  America does cause a lot of its own problems.  When we all look in the mirror, we see the problem staring back at us.  The problem is, we don't acknowledge the problem, and well, the Devil's won. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulaoke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laoke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1334<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/3/02 4:31:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3596.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silly Aishen</span><hr size=1> /applaud Aishen<br>

<br>
I have to agree with Laoke, in that your post was very eloquent and very right on in your assessment regarding anti-racism.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, that has nothing at all to do with what I was talking about, nor the original poster. If you'll refer to my post, you'll notice my main (and mostly only) gripe was in regards to people who <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> cannot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> speak English.<br>
<br>
I think racism is an idiotic venture. People have more than enough stupidity on their own to lump them based upon stereotypes. But regardless of the evils of racism, that doesn't change the fact that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  You're in America! Speak English! </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
About the paralegal argument, that's a very good point, and I think that for legal documents, any and every step should be taken to provide as much clarity to anything. Legal documents are confusing, and are a separate situation.<br>
<br>
I have more of an inkling to the situation where bi-lingual signs are posted everywhere, directions for use are tri-lingual, and all of the other little un-neccesary steps taken that allow people to not speak English.<br>
<br>

<br>
How about just because it's easier for young children to learn languages (especially the phonetics) before the age of 12? Why NOT learn Spanish? or French? or German?  From my own experience majoring in French, few things give students a better understanding of English grammar than studying the grammar rules of another language.<br>
<br>
The United States is singuarly small minded when faced with international communication.  &quot;Isn't even native to their country,&quot; I'm glad that the people I work with in Singapore, New Delhi and Hong Kong don't share that enlightened view of the world.  <br>

I have no problem with childern learing another language in school.. i DO have a problem with it forced upon them...<br>
<br>
Ysall..<br>
<br>
As far as what is stated on the food of the statue of liberty, i say this. <br>
<br>
We as a country or as americans.. never once forced people to move here.. this is a choice they make.  When you make a choice to go move to a new country.. you should make an effort to learn the langage.  As I would if i went to France or Italy..  to make it easier on me.<br>
<br>
Some one also mentioned that in europe they tend to speak more than one language.  Well.. all of europe fits into like Texas?!!   It is close.. it is small... its already moved to one form of currency.  Point being.. its easier for them to get around that way when you can drive from one country to another in a matter of hours... its a choice.. and they made it.  Most of the schools DO teach English..  because knowing english makes it easier.<br>

I may be wrong here, but the French have legislation against the pejoration of their language, meaning it cannot be altered by dialect or addition of foreign loan words. Iceland insists upon you taking a patronymic name and learning Icelandic. I think they have similar laws about altering Icelandic.<br>

No, Fori, no-one made anyone live in America, unless you were a slave, but the USA did openly encourage immigration for the longest time. It still has a green card lottery which is possibly a relic of this.<br>

<br>
I agree, Gloriana, that phonetics are at their most prime learning stage during the 4-10 year period. You're right on the money. But the lackadaisical methods of public school systems <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> prevent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bi-lingual teaching institutions to be effective, and ultimately fail; whereas promoting English in that same time frame <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> would</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be effective, and here's why.<br>
<br>
Due to the language barriers and vast differences between the romance languages and English, children (and adults) need a constant stream of use in order to retain knowledge. I constantly hear of people talking about how they've lost a large majority of the alternate language they took in high school and/or college.<br>
<br>
The reason is because they don't practice. And we can't expect children in a gradeschool situation to become fluent and practice that fluency on a regular basis, when the majority of their culture doesn't speak that same language. Sure there's the spanish channel on T.V., but by the complex equation of &quot;effort/laziness&quot; we see that there's a difference between idealism, and practicality.<br>
<br>
And this of course is assuming the child achieves fluency, based off of 5 hours a week in class being mass taught spanish. What's going to happen is kids learn how to count, tell the time, and basic noun usage.<br>
<br>
How useful is that? Honestly? Since school hours are so precious anyway, and children are burdened with homework everyday since the school day isn't long enough, why would anyone support a program that promotes inefficiency?<br>
<br>
If you took this 5 hours a week and instead of branching your time into multiple languages spent a concentrated effort on the English language, you'd achieve much more beneficial results.<br>
<br>
The English language <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be constantly streamed throughout the childs life. By spending time not on noun usage, and instead focusing on grammar usage, improved spelling and vocabulary, you would notice results that actually effect childrens lives. <br>
<br>
And don't get me started on children that are poor at English, that are required to take Spanish. Children who are behind their class in reading skills are wasting time falling behind in another language, instead of being able to spend the time developing these underused skills.<br>
<br>
One of the number one skills employers look for is communication skills, both written and oral. Everyone likes speaking to someone who is well spoken, and by allowing more time on our native tongue, we would achieve and improve upon that. <br>
<br>
There is no need in generalizing our efforts, when we would achieve much more spectacular results by focusing our energies into one effect, rather than several. All we are achieving now is a waste of already precious school budget and time, which doesn't benefit anyone.<br>

Wow... I have a newfound respect for you. I like to consider myself a thick-skinned person with most subjects, but when people start knocking on topics that specifically affect my race/background/family, I get extremely hot-headed. You, on the other hand, have met it head on with logic and real-life experiences. I would personally like to congratulate you. You've said all of the things I wanted to say but couldn't get out because I was so fuming pissed off.<br>
<br>
And to those that oppose: I'm sorry you feel that way. At this point, that's really the only response I can offer. I'd have to agree with the sentiment that you should speak your mind to your congressman, 'cause if you don't (and live near the Mexican border), in twenty years you'll be speaking to someone with a Spanish last name. If that's the case, I suggest you exercise something I haven't seen in any of these threads - an open mind and tactfulness.<br>

<br>
i live in canada and there are two official languages here... well obviously, we have a problem with some quebecois whom wants to seperate quebec from canada... well, this is directly related to the concept and the idea of nationalism.<br>
<br>
what makes a nation-state?<br>
remember, before the end of 18th century, and the the unity of italy and germany, there is no such thing as nationalism.  the so called &quot;borders&quot; are not well defined, they were more like zones of control - cities are surrounded by huge walls, and the people don't really care about where that ideally invisible-thin-line-that-has-no-thickness (aka border) lies either.  without nationalism, the united states wouldn't bother to get united in the first place - without the concept of a nation-state, the uniting states would be nothing, state(s) in and of itself doesn't make a nation.<br>
<br>
a formation of a nation is not a simple phenomenon, i'll say.<br>
<br>
here's some quote from john breuilly (who wrote nationalism and the state):<br>
<br>
&quot;The term 'nationalism' is used to refer to political movements seeking or exercising state power and justifying such actions with nationalist arguments. <br>
<br>
&quot;A nationalist argument is a political doctrine built upon three basic assertions:<br>
<br>
a) There exists a nation with an explicit and peculiar character. <br>
b) The interests and values of this nation take priority over all other interests and values. <br>
c) The nation must be as independent as possible. This usually requires at least the attainment of political sovereignity.&quot;<br>
<br>
language can be, and is often, considered as an explicit and peculiar character of a nation.  francophones are different from anglophones, simple as that, and as simple as canada tried to included both french and english into the catagory of the official languages (from very early on, mind you), there are still many separaists remain in quebec.  what does this say about language and nation?  well, i'm not saying quebec should stay or not, and neither am i saying the united states should have english as the official language, but your land of the free is a nation with a definite border, a definite form of citizenship, a system of government, and its national interest...<br>
<br>
a common language and the loyality to the nation was the basic requirement in the early french republic (obviously after the revolution), and i'm quite sure the american republic (it is not a democracy!  if you still need to doubt, wait until you read all about the ills of the real democracy in ancient athens and you'll be glad that you are not in a real democracy) has more or less the same ideal, which was different from the germanic empire ideal of a single race.<br>
<br>
some ppl here seems to see the nagative side of nationalism... but let me point out one obvious fact about nationalism:<br>
nationalism is not made to lessn the culture gap, it is designed _explicitly_ to divide people.  if you disagree with this aspect of nationalism... well, you don't believe in the legitamacy of the nation-state... hm... my thoughts are jumping everywhere... but anyways, yea, what all of you are talking about is not merely a language issue, it's about the basic concept of nationalism. <p><center><A HREF="http://www.clanautumnwood.com" TARGET="_top">
