Used to be a time that I didn't need to ask the loot rules in a pick-up group.  All the ones I've ever been in have let whoever can use the item have it (or roll on it if more than one can use), not whoever can use the item for their twink or to fund their bank account.  All you can do now to avoid these little whining sessions is for all people to ask what type of loot rules the prospective group has. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvendrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vendrix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1252<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 10:50:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3065.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, seeing as how we've already hijacked the thread...</span><hr size=1> ... and if those BlackSnow gheys win that lame-ass lawsuit against Mythic, a whole lot more people are going to be playing for <u>just</u> loot. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
In my first post on this thread, I mention that NBG/FFA is not answered, and will probably not be in a foreseeable future. Although I do agree with NBG and always do it with my friends, I've seen it abused so many times that when playing with starngers I asume FFA on droppable loot.<br>
<br>
Now, last loot I got in a pickup group was given to me using NBG as it was an upgrade to me. But that wsa a group of 4, 2 of which were guildies, and the first thing I did was ask the only person in the group I didn't know if he wanted to roll. If he had decided that he wanted to, I would have rolled and never considered flaming the guy. The point is we did not have a prior agreement.<br>
<br>
And as Cenelron says, there is nothing to be gained for a caster in OS. Since Luclin came out, the level required to find a group in OS is over the normal level at which a caster gets his froggy robe, so on about the only item a caster could want he can't even roll because it is lore and he already has one. Most of the time, NBG = tanks take all and if a caster does not have a strong guild to back him up he does not even get enough to buy half of his spells.<br>
<br>
Well... I'm ranting against NBG again even though that is what I use over 90% of the time...<br>
<br>
But the real point is, anyone assuming anything is just WRONG. You never KNOW people agree with you until you ASK them. So next time ask, and if you can't find an agreement just don't group. I never have that problem because I know friends &gt;&gt; any loot. I might have spent more time in this game helping assholes than it would have taken me to get the same equipment without friends, but I feel I'm still better of because on top of that equipment I have friends, lots of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukavissilversteel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kavis Silversteel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 11:03:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3065.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, seeing as how we've already hijacked the thread...</span><hr size=1> Maybe my response to this thread was a little harsh at the beginning and for that I do apologize.

But why did you have to even bring this to a public board is what I don't understand?<br>
<br>
As for the random,  I never assume anything when I am not in a guild group.  Guild groups the ppl are out for the guild and not for themselves.  Pickup groups seems to be everyone is out for themselves, with the exception of one group I was in last week, thanks again to &quot;A twist of fate&quot; for having ideals a lot like PC.  Had  a great time with you.<br>
<br>
Anyway, next time you have an issue with a member of PC, come talk to any elder of PC and we will try our best to get it remedies.  While the first post was vague about what actually happened, I know you lost the random and were mad.

What were loot rules..were they decided in advance?<br>
<br>
How many of the group actually wanted riat to have said item?<br>
<br>
How many when it dropped said &quot;i want in on roll&quot;?<br>
<br>
Any one of the above three makes the nbg/ffa argument useless.If loot order is not decided at the beginning of the  group,then it is up to the group as a whole to decide,and if one person don't like it,he can be replaced.<br>

<br>
It sounds like the looting rules were not set out before hand, which does hurt Riat's case, BUT when all of the other casters in the group had the decency to sit out on the roll because of the clear need of the Monk, it makes the lone caster demanding a roll look like very much of a loot whore.<br>
<br>
I've been playing since summer of 99 and to this day 99% of all pick up groups i do have always been understood as NBG groups.  Why do mostly tanks support NBG..because tanks have nothing but armor to rely on.  As soon as casters start condoning the randoming of spells they NEED to all group memebers casters will never win the arguement.<br>

<br>
But I do agree with you on the spells thing.  If you want to go NBG (and just to make it clear, I am anti-NBG), then randoming of spells to all is only fair.  Some of those spells go for a nice chunk of change.  And don't give me that &quot;well a caster can sit down and scribe the spell, it's the same thing as no-drop&quot;.  Bullshit.  A caster can abuse NBG just as well as a tank.  He can always pretend to be scribing a spell he already has.  I think it would just work out better that if you aren't going to use an item/spell, DON'T ROLL ON IT! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvelondrasedai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VelondraSedai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 8:08:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3065.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, seeing as how we've already hijacked the thread...</span><hr size=1>  The moral is that it is always good to check with a group before you start fighting about loot policy. I have seen coutless casters give up melee loot to melees because the group was nbg, in camps that drop NO caster gear and NO spells. I always feel kind of bad, because casters work too, and that 7k might buy them a new robe. Where as it might have only been an 3 damage less than the melee's current wep. I group either way, and either way makes sense.<br>
   As for this post my opinion is that if you didn't state the loot ahead, at least you will never make that mistake again. Though I might harbor hard feelings if a mage walked away with an item I could have used, if it is roll to all it is roll to all. I was in a group where a jade mace dropped but we were not nbg so it was rolled to all. Myself the monk and the warrior were kinda sad to see it go to a chanter, but that is the way it is. A random has no bias, so be it. <br>

<br>
Two things are so clear to me, yet I see these kinds of threads over and over again.<br>
<br>
1.  If you have a dispute with a person who is guilded and can't get satisfaction through direct discussion with that person, seek out a guild officer.<br>
  <br>
(PC is large enough that I think there is almost always at least one officer available.  I've never had a problem that one of their officers wouldn't listen to or help to resolve, even if it wasn't a &quot;PC&quot; group/raid.)<br>
<br>
2.  ALWAYS state what the loot rules are whenever a new member joins the group.  NBG/FFA/Random ALL may be YOUR standard, but they may not be someone else's.<br>
<br>
Two simple concepts that would save a lot of IG frustration.<br>

Wanna make Melee's feel useless and angry ? Wanna get buttloads of EXP while the Melee sits LFG ?<br>
<br>
Well if you have answered &quot;Yes&quot; to any of the above then i have just the thing for you. Yes my friend it is possible YOU can have that SBC and Lamentation to admire while you are medding. &quot;How?&quot; you ask, why its simple my friend gather a nice cleric a couple wizzies a couple enchies and &quot;WHOOSH&quot; AoE baby yea thats right AoE. Kill hundreds of frogs in no time flat while gaining insane amounts of EXP. not only that you never hafta have a melee call NBG in ur grp again.<br>
<br>
&quot;btw is u aint smart enough to realize im bein a smart alek bah &quot;<br>

Go to one that has lewt that you want for your class and stop bitching about people actually getting useful upgrades that they otherwise would have to spend a lifetime savings on to buy from a caster.<br>
<br>
Going to OS as a caster and complaining when a RBG drops and a monk wearing a spider fur belt is in group who could actually use it gets it makes about as much sense as masturbation without orgasm.  Grow up..move to a zone with your drops and stay there.  Tanks will find guildies more than willing to go exp and do OS for items and spells from juggs/reets.  Besides Pickups inherently suck ass anyway as we all know.<br>

And if you have a decent guild and have made friends you should be able to find people willing to help you farm caster equipment too.  If not..then you may want to work on your social skills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucenelrontanknpuller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cenelron TankNPuller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/21/02 1:11:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3065.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, seeing as how we've already hijacked the thread...</span><hr size=1> Poppen, list the zones (high end) that have more caster drop than melee or even have anywhere near 50% of their drops caster drops.<br>

I'll help:  Siren's Grotto.....the end.<br>
<br>
Wanna expand that a little more?  Fear is probably 50/50 depending whether you count hybrid stuff.<br>
<br>
Hmmmm.....wonder why few groups ever hunt Siren's Grotto?<br>

Maybe casters are bitching for a reason?   Maybe you're a moron who doesn't know what he's talking about?  Who knows....<br>

Go to one that has lewt that you want for your class *<br>
<br>
Ok you march into OS without any Clerics, Enchanters, Shaman, Mages, Necros, and Druids and see how much of your phat lewt you get.<br>
<br>
Risk = Reward???????<br>
<br>
I personally dont mind NBG but when I look on the spell Bazzar and see some 60 Warrior selling a shaman spell leaving it go for 5 days just letting the dogs fight over the scraps makes me sick.<br>
<br>
When the casters want to hold your loot for ransom you cry bloody murder.<br>
<br>
Example Shaman Spell Group Regrowth (lvl 56) Ghie had an auction and I lost BUT he was a gentlemen and stopped the auction at 4K.  <br>
<br>
There is another auction going for this spell that has been going on before Ghie's was even posted.<br>
<br>
This spell will prob sell double that of what Ghie sold his for.  Why?<br>
<br>
Because everyone knows how desperate casters are.  Some are gentlemen and others hold the spell up in the air as the Bear Formed Shamans try to jump and get their treat.  They hold on just before the last bear gives up and there isnt a damn thing casters can do about it.  Eventually we need to shell out and get our spells.<br>
<br>
When is everyone going to realise that a caster with a full spellbook will help YOU OUT. Next time you ask for uber buff 1 and cannot have it because caster 2 didnt have the 100k to get it stop and think for a minute.<br>
<br>
You want NBG then stop being so greedy with spell x that drops when certain class y happened not to be there.<br>

Other then that our group is always NbG first and then randoming the stuff that no one really could use as an upgrade.  We don't state that from the beginning I thought all groups played NbG as standerd.  I guess I was wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukragarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kragarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/21/02 3:42:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3065.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, seeing as how we've already hijacked the thread...</span><hr size=1> Ghia you really need to get some help with this PC fixation you have, otherwise in the future people will be referring to you are Chiteng:The Sequel.<br>

As far as assuming, please raise your hand if you don't know what assuming makes u and me.<br>

FFS(thanks for this one Kam <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) even on this board you can't get a definitive answer one way of the other about which should be the standard, NBG or roll for everything.  Why would people keep posting that &quot;all my groups are NBG/Random all, doesn't everyone play that way?&quot;.<br>
<br>
I will try and go slow and use small words:<br>
<br>
Ask. . . . what. . . . the. . . . . loot . . . . rules . . . are. . . when. . . you . . . . join . . . a . . group.<br>
<br>
Failure to do so means you forfeit your right to bitch/piss&amp;moan/whine if you lose something to a random or NBG.<br>
