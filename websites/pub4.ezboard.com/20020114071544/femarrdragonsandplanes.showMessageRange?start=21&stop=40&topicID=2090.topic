Can you all actually tell me you have never encountered a person that makes an offer to you simply to get your interest, finds out what you are willing to trade for whatever the item is then offers platinum for those items after hours of dickering?  Many times you find out that this guy never had the item you were originally interested in.  This type of stuff is Horseshit.  It wastes the time of folks that would rather be gouging out their eyes than sitting in EC.  The same applies to the people Bodie seemed to be pointing a finger at.  People that KNOW the price of an item and are willing to sell it to a newb for 10 times what it is worth.  The same guy wasting everyone’s time and being a greedy fuck when a piece of loot drops.  These are the same folks that would take a roll on a piece of gear THEY WERE WEARING just to sell it WHILE someone in their group actually needed the gear.<br>
<br>
How do you make the distinction between the 30% of folks doing stuff like this and the actual clueless salesmen out there?  Pretty tough call when the guys most likely to do this sort of thing are the ones that only stand to make a worthwhile profit if you do not know who or what they are.  Here is a clue.  If after trying to get to a compromise for 2 hours of haggling you find your deal suddenly dissolve when you thought it was finally ending, if you can’t get a response asking price to an initial offer (“I was looking for a bit more than that”, rather than an actual price), if the guy with the item refuses to show you that item in a trade window, or if you notice 4 different low level characters selling the same item but they are never all on at once, chances are you have found one of the folks Bodie was talking about.<br>

<br>
As for Brodie, it might surprise you to realise, but I have understood exactly what you were saying right from the start. I have mainly been posting because I get a kick out of irritating you :)<br>
<br>
But I have also been posting because even though you might be making a valid point, it doesnt mean you choose a good way to phrase things. In fact I would say you go out of your way to choose the nastiest way to phrase anything you post here.<br>
<br>
You start off by saying everyone who says &quot;Make offers&quot; is a greedy whore. Thats what... just about everyone, right?<br>
<br>
Then, once afew people called you the polite equivalent of an idiot, you get alittle more specific. Now we are targetting only those people who have a vauge idea of what they are after, but want to see what sort of interest is out there... those BASTARDS!<br>
<br>
Then, we get to your last post, which clarifies on the clarification, and now we are just against people who know what they want and still ask for offers. I wish I could read minds like you can, it would be useful to divine the intentions of others from afew lines of noncommital text.<br>
<br>
I know what your point is... but I think you are missing mine. My point simply is, you cannot possibly KNOW what the motivations of others are in an area where there are so many possible reasons. All you are doing is making a guess, and why am I not surprised you assume the worst?<br>
<br>
But mainly I just enjoy winding you up ;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upinganonwindrider.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pinganon Windrider</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Will Port for Cyber</span><br>  Posts: 406<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/29/01 6:58:47 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.afflictionguild.com/media/users/Pinganon/Duckicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re : Virral the Lewt Whore</span><hr size=1> Two scenarios, as it appears some are still failing to grasp the point of the original post.<br>
<br>
[Me] Buying Singing Steel bracer.<br>
[Seller_01] I have one.<br>
[Me] What are you looking for?<br>
[Seller_01] Make an offer.<br>
<br>
***Note:  Right here, this can go two different ways.<br>
<br>
First:<br>
<br>
[Me] 3k<br>
[Seller_01] No thanks, sorry.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:  This person is a greedy asshole.  When he said &quot;Make offer&quot;, he was waiting for me to offer him some ridiculous amout more than what they actually wanted for the item.  Fuck this person.<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
<br>
[Me] 3k.<br>
[Seller_01] Im not really sure of the price, that seems a little low.  How about 5k?<br>
<br>
Conclusion:  The is the kind of person who is very easy to deal with.  May be greedy, but not out to fuck you in the ass w/ a dildo wrapped in sandpaper.<br>
<br>
This is something that gets on my nerves.  Especially when it involves stupid shit like cat pelts where morons are trying to suck every plat out of you they can.<br>

Conclusion : He doesnt want to sell it for 3k. His motivations are, in my opinion, unclear. Is it so hard to believe he might think its worth more? or that he might just never accept the first offer? or that he is using the bracer and would only sell it for an above average price?

I'm very fine with this, I don't expect them to.  He asked me to make an offer, and I did.<br>
<br>
--&quot;His motivations are, in my opinion, unclear. Is it so hard to believe he might think its worth more?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, thats fine.  If he thinks it's worth more than that, why not fucking tell me?   I'll tell you why, it's because he wants me to make an offer thats MORE than what he thinks it's worth.  i.e., greedy fuckbag.<br>
<br>
--&quot;or that he might just never accept the first offer?&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, communication.  Tell me that.  When I make him an offer, and he replies back, &quot;LOLOLOLO ROFFTLE, no thanks!&quot; I immediately want to hang him by his short hair.  He's trying to rook me.<br>
<br>

<br>
Same here.<br>
<br>
--&quot;Or all sorts of things COULD be true, including your scenario. Not ONLY your scenario, INCLUDING your scenario.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't disagree with your here.  It's just the methods that some people employ when selling items makes it really simple to tell when they're trying to completely fuck you over.  99% of the time it's the people that reply with &quot;Make offer.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
In case there's anyone else who has trouble reading:  I say &quot;Make an offer.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I knew within two sentences that Jengo wasn't talking about me.  Ussually, when someone does make an offer...I consider that offer.  If it's low, I say &quot;Actually I wasthing more like XXXp, but can you at least go as high as XXp?&quot;<br>
<br>
If it's high, I say 'too high' and say &quot;I was only thinking XXp&quot;  Just because most of the server thinks ripping people off for something they spent allot of time trying to get is worth a few little numbers in a little cartoon world, doesn't mean we all do.  I appreciate the assumption though.<br>
<br>
Jengo, for the slow, was talking about the losers who wont accept reasonable offers (or even going rate offers) yet refuse to even so much as make a counter offer, leaving no clue at all what the magic number really is, as if we're all here to play a fun little fantasy version of 'The Price is Right.'.  He made it quite clear, but I guess you had to read more than the first sentece to get that point, and I understand, this can be a trying task at times. <br>
<br>
Thanks you, for making it this far into my post.  I didn't mean to cause you any mental harm.<br>

<br>
Thanks Bodie, I would be delighted if you word things as clearly as possible. Cos muhh reding an writing thingyz r un good.<br>
<br>
Aolynd, maybe having your lips firmly implanted to Bodie's Unholy Opening gives you some special powers, but I find it hard to spot that specific type from Bodies posts. Now if he had worded it the way you did, no problems :)<br>
<br>
Just for the ones who skipped my last post, I understood implicitly what Bodie was on about. I just don't like him, and at the sight of his rather vauge posts, saw a great opportunity to really annoy him. I tried the best I could with my substandard reading comprehension, but I think I can safely say :<br>
<br>
Mission Accomplished. Thanks for your time :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upaniholygrove.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pani Holygrove</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/29/01 8:25:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> EC is obviously becoming as infamous as OS and KC....stay away from EC!

<br>
Auction = BIDS not a SET price..<br>
<br>
MEANING That offers are allowed..You don't wanna make an offer when I'm not sure of the price of an item and the websites are all wrong and stupid newbies in EC make shit up? Fuck you I dont feel like selling for half the price I COULD get. Have a nice day.<br>

Someone strayed from the path on that one<br>

Hmm hell must be frozen over now. <br>

I even had a druid tell me to offer him pp for a sow in Kunark not to long ago. I said 5pp, &quot;no&quot;. 10pp, &quot;nope&quot;. <br>
So I was like well how much? This guy wanted 20pp for a sow. No sow is ever worth that. Sow is always free when I cast it.<br>

Hold on a minute there. The guy may have asked you to make an offer because he wasn't aware of the price. He may then very well think your offer is fair and accept your 3k.<br>
<br>
Which is where you're going to turn round and say &quot;Hey, I was just joking with you..it's worth more then that&quot;  No..I didn't think so.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I understood what Bodie was trying to say. I got the original post but I don't think the way he expressed it was clear enough that half the EM board should be jumping on it. People who try to rip others off....nasty nasty people. People who try to get more then an items worth....well I'd just love to see you shout &quot;BASTARD...I can get a better car cheaper&quot; to the salesmen next time your looking for a new set of wheels.<br>

People don't dare run round screaming when one supermarket sells coffee for more then another. They go somewhere else to buy their coffee. The anonymity of online gaming makes it easier for people to get away with stuff they wouldn't even attempt in real life.<br>
