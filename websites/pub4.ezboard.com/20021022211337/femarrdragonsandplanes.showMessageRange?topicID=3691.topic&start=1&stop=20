S. of A.</span><hr size=1> I'm a fairly easy going person.  I'm not very intimidating IRL.  I'm sweet, sincere, and just gosh darn oh so lovable.  Today, though, is when I turn around and my alter ego rears its head.  It's not everyday I call upon her for help.  She's mean.  She's nasty.  But sometimes, she's a necessity for certain situations, such as when I touch the buttons on the telephone to dial up the corporate bastards known as SouthEast Toyota Finance and AOL.<br><br>SouthEast Toyota Finance is a story I may reserve for another day, for we'll see if they cash my damn check today or do as I say and wait till tomorrow.  My nasty alter ego is waiting for them to fu<i></i>ck me over and make me wire the money, which they haven't technically done yet, so we'll see if they'll do that since corporate bastards like seeing little people like me suffer.<br><br>Onto the evil institution known as AOL.  Why, do you ask, does someone as intelligent as myself choose to commit myself to AOL?  I blame my relatives and their ignorance.  In purchasing my laptop 3 years ago, my mother decided to take advantage of the $300 rebate by signing up with CompuServe for 3 years.  Too late did we discover CompuServe is owned by the evil corporate entity, AOL.  I don't blame her.  She's hitting her golden ages and the last decade wasn't kind with its techinological advances.<br><br>One day I was surfing the net on my laptop.  I like my laptop because I can sprawl out on my bed, half naked or fully naked (depending on how warm it is), and surf the internet to my heart's delight.  Everybody needs the occasional braindead surf every now and then, and the CS login popups are full of links to useless information.  It's the best place to find reads that offer little stimulation and information you don't need to know.  It's like.. reading an issue of Cosmo.  98% of it is interestingly dumb information.  What type of lipcolor are the women in Houston wearing?!  How about Chicago?!  Are orange lip colors passe?!  What's the new best way to starve oneself to attract a sick man who appreciates and emanciated woman?!  Are small boobs in again?!   .....yadda yadda and so on and so forth.  The CS popups usually entail information like this- <i>Read This!  What CABBAGE can do for your health!  This just in!  Neon mice bred in Swedish lab!  Oooh! JLo at nude beach!</i> I'm rarely in the mood to read these articles, but the mood hits every so often and now and then.<br><br>On Friday, I crawled out of bed disheveled and was thoroughly grumpy.  Life was all awry.  It was fine the day before, but today, the stars had aligned themselves against my benefit and I had fallen in a funk.  I drug myself to the kitchen and ignored my cats' plea for food and made myself some coffee.  I sat at the computer, right next to the always-open window, and sipped my highly sugared caffeinated beverage.  I lit a cigarette.  I read my e-mail and read some articles from msnbc.com.  This daily ritual usually brings me much delight, but not today.  Remember, I blamed the stars.<br><br>I got a call that Toyota went against my instructions and tried to cash my check before the 1st.  Didn't matter.  Was unfazed.  I've dealt with SouthEast Toyota before and they're a bunch of stupid southerners.  Stupid is as stupid be, and there were stupid people everywhere so I must learn to be compassionate and not discriminate between the regional backgrounds of stupid individuals.  So, I take back my last remark.  I've dealt with SouthEast Toyota before and they're a bunch of WHORES.  Better.<br><br>Anyway, I digress.  (Minor rant: It's "anyway" sans the "s" and not "anywayS."  "Anyways" is hick.)  So there I was, absolutely undone in sort of a sexy way, and realized my husband was still underway at sea.  Damn Navy.  The Navy's full of WHORES, too.  I want my husband home so I have somebody to whine to.  Somebody to swindle to do my bidding, like drive across town to fetch me a cup of Baskin Robbin's Cappuccino Blast twenty minutes before they close, only to take three sips of it and leave the rest on the kitchen counter.  I needed a good whine.  <i>Baby... babykins.. babyboo.. poooookie.. pookiekins... honeybeeee... please, you promised you'd take care of me.. you're the man in this relationship... please, please, please baby, babykins, pookiekins, please get me a Cappuccino Blast? </i>  Of course thoughts of missing whining because of lack of a husbandry presence led to thoughts of lack of sex, also due to lack of presence of said husband.  Life was not good, and it was only 10:30AM.  Not good.  Definitely not good.<br><br>I checked my fridge and it was definitely time to go to the market and get more food.  But, I was in a funk and wouldn't even drag my a<i></i>ss to the shower, going to the market would have been deemed even moreso unacceptable as a course of action.  I had apples.  I could live off apples.  Then I looked in the mirror and jumped on the scale and realized that since Adam had left I weighed about 15 lbs lighter which is the sole work of my laziness.  I decided lazy funks may not be such a bad thing after all.  My current level of hunger is suppressable and not enough to warrant me getting up to turn on the stove.  If Adam were here he'd just make me eat, and since I'm pretty sure all the weight I'd lost was water weight, I'd gain it all effin back.  Not good.  Thoughts of quick weight gain looped into my head and I got mad.  First Toyota, then remembering the lack of sex, and now the inevitable weight gain when I decide I'm hungry enough to turn on the damn stove.<br><br>So.  By 11AM I was disheveled, unwashed, but not stinky since I'm Asian and we as a race possess remarkably low levels of B.O.  Anyway, there I sat on my computer chair, one leg draped over the arm, dressed in only my underoos and a tank top, and though chilling winds were blowing right onto me from the open window right next to me, I was too lazy to go A. put on pants, B. get a jacket, or C. close said window.  I had been informed I may need to go wire money later in the week because the STUPID WHORES known as SouthEast Toyota Finance couldn't adhere to simple instructions, I cursed life for not making me keep the check just one more day so circumstances could present themselves to lead me to post date the check to the STUPID SOUTHEAST WHORES.  I was also hungry but not hungry enough to make or get food.  I also was sex starved and needed a good fu<i></i>ck.  Excuse my French, I'm highly irritable atm.<br><br>I could log onto EQ but EQ's full of GAMING WHORES.  I started to notice a trend.  I could go see some Navy wives but they're all NAVAL WHORES.  Maybe.. I was... just.. fu<i></i>cked up at the moment?  Maybe?  Naaaw I'm a well adjusted 21 year old female who has shown high levels of Borderline Personality Disorder.  Hey, I always tell myself, blame Dad for that sh<i></i>it- I emerged from the womb perfect.  Then my mind sparked a debate and I remembered my father, the WHORE who blamed me for causing the divorce because I was the one who found out he was fu<i></i>cking another woman.  I felt better after I envisioned my father standing right next to me, and screamed WHORE at the wall.  In this case, the word "whore" was the right one to use.<br><br>Enough with the trivial details of life, I thought to myself, I'll go snuggle up on my bed and surf on my laptop.  I had caffeine and nicotine running through my dehydrated system- I was good to go!  I turned on the laptop and surfed the web for 30 min and decided it was enough and tried to log off.  I clicked disconnect and a huge a<i></i>ss popup window jumps and tries to load.  Usually, they're for the occasional digital camera or a subscription to Maxim, and the "disconnect now" button generally is the one highlighted.  I always wonder why the fu<i></i>ck those AOL WHORES need to popup these ads when I'm trying to fu<i></i>cking disconnect.  So, I hit 'enter' thinking "no sh<i></i>it, Sherlock, of course I want to disconnect now."  Then another popup window shows up and I think to myself "sh<i></i>it!"  It was too late.  The occasional AOL ad highlights the 'join now' button instead of disconnect.  I was suddenly face to face with a window congratulating me for signing up for AOL.  Now, mind you, this isn't to transfer my CS account to AOL, it's to sign up for BOTH.  Oh ha ha ha I have a dial up account, but I want two!  Oh that's just moronic.  WHORES!  All of them WHORES!<br><br>So, I log back on and fish out an online form to send queries to the CS billing department.  Fill out all the information and *gasp* message cannot be sent!  Try at a later time!  I grit my teeth and narrow my eyes.  Instead, I send an e-mail to General Support and explain my predicament.  I don't want AOL and I can't contact CS Billing.<br><br>Fast forward to the next day.....<br><br>I wake up, even more disheveled, but sexier than ever since I am oozing with sexual energy as of late, severely in need of a good, hard --censored--.  In a better mood, I descend upon the kitchen and whup up my coffee, go sit down in front of the computer, and light my cigarette (of which I am going to try to quit again sometime in the future).  I read my e-mail and I have myself a reply from CS2gen@cs.com.  I open it up and it tells me... <i>A pleasant day to you!  I'm sorry that were stupid enough to sign up for CS, you or someone you know was unfortunate enough to fall for the rebate, huh?  Sucker.  Oh well, I'm not authorized to escalate your concerns to the billing department because the more we delay you contacting billing, the more money the corporate a$$hole looming over us will get, so use the fill out form in the help section, which you probably already did since you told me you did in your email, to contact billing!  May you have a good day and may CS Billing elude you further!</i><br><br>I try the form again.  Still broken.<br><br>I copy/paste the messages and send them back to General support, telling them the fu<i></i>cking form doesn't work.  That if it did work, I wouldn't be effin contacting General support.<br><br>I pamper myself a little bit by eating the tiny kid sized bag of Cheese Nips in the pantry, out of sheer starvation.  I could cook, but it's quite all right.  My nerves are already vexed and I deter myself from suffering any further exertion, cooking and feeding myself included.<br><br>Instead, I go and bug Nire.  I make Nire call me and we discuss how bored we are and how nice it is to be bored together.  Of course, he interrupts me every five minutes to announce how much he needs to get laid.  I end up saying, "YES, you do" every 5 min as a result.  The day waxes on and I get by without feeling hungry (relief to know I don't need to turn on the stove) and I actually get sleepy and I scurry off to bed, still disheveled and unwashed.<br><br>Next day...<br><br>I get up and I finally find the energy to go take a shower.  I scrub myself down from head to toe and emerge spanky clean from the bathroom, smelling like floral aromatics.  <br><br>I get an e-mail back from another customer service representative.  This one is a woman, so I have a little more faith in this one, hoping this one actually read the entire 4 line message I sent.  Women are patient creatures, supposedly, so perhaps this one would tell me what I need to know.<br><br><i>Dear Alice, a pleasant day to you!  We work for dipsh!ts, so please excuse the evil corporate devil's ways.  But, we're experiencing technical difficulties at present, so the e-mail for billing is cs2bill@cs.com, have a nice day!</i><br><br>Cool.  May have taken two tries to get the WHORES to give me an email.  So.. lalalala, I type up an e-mail detailing my AOL predicament and I go to lengths to explain that it mustn't EVER happen because if it did, I'd sell my soul and St. Peter would deny me entrance at the pearly gates and I'd go to hell forever and it'd be a mockery of my First Amendment right of religion if they allow a charge to occur on my credit card and tarnish my perfect record of making only pr0n and amazon.com charges on my pristine card.  I was quite delighted with the finished product.  I click 'send' and...<br><br>....Error!  Unknown member!<br><br>My teeth grind.  My eyes narrow.  My jaws tighten.  My left nostril begins to twitch.  My hands clench into fists.  I throw myself onto the bed and remind myself- "CS bad, computer good" to make sure I don't throw my laptop out the window.<br><br>Enough.  It ends today.  The lack of sexual gratification, the hicks working for SouthEast Toyota, the hunger, the hide and seek with CS billing, and on top of that, it's Monday and it's the 30th.  I hate Mondays and I hate 30th's.  WHORES!  Monday is a WHORE!<br><br>So, today, I salute the corporate bastards of the USA.  <br><br>..|..

Payday is every second Friday, occasionally the due date for insurance would 1 or 2 days before payday. The first time this happened I called them up, and told them I wouldn't have money till Friday, and the woman said &quot;that's fine, it will try again and withdraw on friday&quot; then 2 months later it happened again, but I didn't call to ask if it was alright. they got their money the next day when it retried, but this wasn't good enough. I got a letter in the mail the next week saying &quot;you were late with 2 payments, so we're cutting you off&quot; I called them and let them know someone there TOLD me it was alright, but they said &quot;oh well, head office is cutting you off, not us&quot;<br><br>It's all good though, I called around and found another place $15 cheaper (wow eh, 15 freaking dollars, so I only pay $175/mo now) who lets me have some options for payments and they specifically told me that if I can't make the payment on the due date cause I get paid a couple days later, they don't care.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138154"><img src="http://www.tbaytel.net/scaryf/images/everquest/razeratof.gif"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigota.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Igota</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1403<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/30/02 6:52:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3691.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Corporate Bastards of the Good ol' U.
