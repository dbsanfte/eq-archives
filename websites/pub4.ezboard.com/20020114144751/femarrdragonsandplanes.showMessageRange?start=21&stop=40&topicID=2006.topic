He was a waste of space on this planet. Bad it took so long. He was a) obviously and clearly guilty, b) total without any form of remorse at all. Why did it take what 6 years ? <br>
<br>
You can be in society. Or you can be outside. Personally, if you don't want to be in society ie. abide by the rules of wherever you live then a) you deserve the consequences and b) don't deserve any form of sympathy. If McVeigh was a mad &quot;lion&quot; that had gotten lose from the zoo and ate 160+ people he would have been put down without remorse. If he was a sniper with an automatic rifle and gunned down 160+ people in a shopping mall before being taken down by a SWAT member nobody would have batted an eyelid and the police man would have gotten a medal. <br>
<br>
Yet for some reason the fact that we paused as a society to judge him and offer him every avenue legally to escape punishment and then killed him is seen as a bad thing. The correct answer is of course that he should have been killed years ago. Quickly, cleanly and without all the media circus that accompanied it , just like any other extermination of vermin. The US media actually gave him the fame he so desired, a better punishment would have been to kill him with no media attention at all. <br>

They have made some excellent points.<br>
I think it's pretty clear that most Americans don't care about "cruel and unusual punishment," unfortunately.  Either that, or they are just unaware of exactly how cruel and unusual the methods we use to execute people are.  Do you know why they cover the heads of people on the electric chair?  Do you know why the first drug given people dying by lethal injection is a muscle relaxant?  I do, and it's horrifying knowledge.<br>
I'm against killing people who are insane, as they aren't responsible for their actions, or retarded people, for the same reason.  Think about getting drunk, for example.  I'm sure everyone who's been drunk has done something they wouldn't do under normal circumstances.  I'm not talking criminal stuff, here, just stupid stuff, like dancing the funky chicken.  Should you be punished for dancing badly because you were drunk?  The same applies, on a greater scale, to insane and retarded criminals who really didn't know what they were doing.<br>
Here's a question.  Would you rather spend life in jail or die?  Personally, I'd pick death.  I think that criminals like McVeigh should be kept in jail without any of the cushy benefits lesser criminals have.  They should not have the possibility of parole.  I am not a nice, sweet person when it comes to punishing criminals like McVeigh.  It's just that I simply cannot resign myself to the idea that it is good and right for people to kill people to say that killing people is wrong and bad.<br>

<br>
The reason that killing someone normally costs the U.S. taxpayers more money than locking them up for the rest of their lives has nothing to do with the cost of the actual execution itself. It is because of the lengthy appeals process in our judicial system. Mr. McVeigh declined a number of his granted appeals to speed up the execution process. The reason he stayed in jail as long as he did is because the judicial system has a mandatory appeal clause for anyone that is convicted and sentenced to death. In other words, if the court decides to kill you, you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> have</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to appeal the ruling to a higher court at least once. After that, it is your decision whether or not you want to fight it anymore.<br>
<br>
Mr. McVeigh decided not to fight the ruling after his first appeal, and he was killed relatively quickly, considering the average time someone spends on death row is about 18 years (i think...correct me if im wrong).<br>
<br>
As far as the death penalty as a whole goes, I think its a mixed bag. I love hearing about some scumbag getting the death penalty, when there is no doubt he is guilty of the crime he has commited. It makes me nervous though, to think about the really iffy cases, where a potentially innocent man may be sentenced to die.<br>
<br>
But in this case, with Mr. McVeigh admitting his guilt, I am glad they killed the bastard. Personally, I dont wouldn't give a shit whether or not he showed remorse. He killed 168 people including federal law enforcement officers and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> children</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->! I would have put up with him pleading for mercy, saying he found Jesus, etc etc, then I would have &quot;flipped the switch&quot; myself.<br>
<br>
Timothy:<br>
&quot;I killed a bunch of kids, but i'm really sorry! No, really! I hate what I've done, and I'm begging for mercy! Please believe me, I regret it! I'm sorry!!!&quot;<br>

I disagree with the death penalty in the United States. <br>
<br>
I hold a degree in criminal justice and during my studies I did a LOT of work and study on the US criminal justice system and let me tell ya something, Its a God forsaken joke. The entire system is screwed up from top to bottom and the possibility of putting an innocent man/woman to death simply scares me because I value ALL human life equally. If the system could be cleaned up (which in reality it most likely cant) then the death penalty would be a sound punishment. <br>
<br>
Another thing that bugs me is this:<br>
<br>
&quot;He was executed for killing 8 Federal Law Enforcement Officers (in addition to the others).&quot;<br>
<br>
Im sorry. As I stated earlier I value all human life equally because I believe that all humans ARE equal. I think its a shame that you can get a different punishment for doing the same crime to different persons or groups of persons. <br>
<br>
And as a side note, yes he was given the death penalty for the death of the 8 federal agents. However, if it were necessary he could have also been tried for the other murders and been given the same sentance <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utullaianstarchaser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tullaian Starchaser</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/11/01 6:18:21 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.users.bigpond.com/anthony_read/tulllogo2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: way to go USA..</span><hr size=1> Actually, I disagree with the defence of "criminal insanity". By that definition you are so insane as to have no understanding of your actions, no understanding of right or wrong and no ability to control whatever urges you have. <br>
<br>
Who would want to live next to such a person ?<br>
<br>
Why should the fact that your brain is so broken as to make you unable to function safely in society be an excuse to gun down anyone you feel like ? If medical science agrees that there is no chance your violent urges can be controlled in any degree of saftey then why exactly should we keep that person around ?<br>
<br>
Most people's issue with the death penalty is not the penalty itself as most folks can agree quite happily to end the life of someone we know 100% to be guilty of certain crimes. The issues usually stem from the uncertainty factor and the method of execution itself. <br>
<br>
From the certainty point of view the issue is more to do with what powers we actually allow our law enforcement officials to use and with how those officials are motivated to perform. Why do we have thousands of laws protecting the rights of the guilty to exclude evidence, deny searches, hide assets and hardly any rules protecting societies' right not to be gunned down in our sleep by a homicidal maniac on a crack overdose ?<br>
<br>
Similarly, if "justice" is of such great importance to society why is it that a basketball player makes more money and is more highly regarded than a policeman ? In ages gone by "lawmen" were the heroes of society. Now, people who enforce and keep our laws are underpaid, underrewarded, undermotivated then we complain that they don't always do a good job. <br>
<br>
If you took all the money made by the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB and turned that into investment in law enforcement, the results would be astounding. <br>
<br>
As for the methods of execution both electrocution and lethal injection are painful, slow and in the case of the chair in some circumstances actually take multiple goes to kill the person. We kill pets more humanely than that. And we certainly don't televise it. Personally, I think that the Judges who pass the scentance should do it. If he isn't guilty enough that you personally are willing to kill him/her then he probably isn't guilty enough to have someone else kill him. <br>

<br>
Just an fyi, your 18 year figure on death row is geographical.<br>
<br>
In Texas, for example, your attorneys for appeal are appointed extremely soon after conviction and your appeals process is started and over very quickly.  Less than 10 years, in most cases.<br>
<br>
In California, on the other hand, can sometimes take up to nine years just to appoint the attorneys for the first appeal.<br>
<br>
An example:<br>
<br>
Aaron Lee Fuller &amp; John Lee Holt were both 23, when they were both sentenced to death for robbing, raping and killing women.  Both had trouble with drugs and troubled childhoods. Both had prior records.<br>
<br>
Fuller committed his crime in Texas.<br>
<br>
March 1989 - crime committed<br>
Feb 1990 - Convicted, appeals lawyer appointed<br>
Mar 1992 - Appeal denied by TX Ct of Appeals<br>
June 1993 - Mandatory appeal denied by US Supreme Ct<br>
Oct 1994 - Writ of habeus corpus denied by original trial judge<br>
March 1995 - Appeal denied by Court of Criminal Appeals<br>
1997 - Appeal denied by 5th Circuit Ct of Appeals<br>
Sept 22 - Request sent to US Supreme Court<br>
1 hour prior to execution - Request denied by US Supreme Ct<br>
11/6/97 - Execution carried out<br>
<br>
Holt committed his crime in California<br>
<br>
July 1989 - Crime committed<br>
May 1990 - Convicted<br>
1993 - Appeals lawyer appointed<br>
1997 - Appeal rejected by California Supreme Court<br>
<br>
<br>
18 years is normal in CA, but not in Texas.  This is what concerns me with the death penalty, not the punishment, but the vast disparity across the country in it's (pardon the pun) execution.<br>

You can suggest prison and rehabilitation program for murderers that would do that (protect) but why ? do we pose the same question when it's an animal ?<br>
<br>
If you think human are better than animal and should be treated better, yes I agree, but these murderers are not human, human does not go around killing another human (war is inhumane note the term !)<br>

So murderers are not human..they are animal..read my 1st sentence !<br>

I'm against the death penalty for the simple reason I could not sit on a jury and convict a man - be a part in sentencing him to death.  That does not sit well with me.  I don't believe it's my job to lay down that kinda judgement.  <br>
<br>
And yes, actually, my uncle, my cousin, two friends of my family and my father were mowed down by a drug addict in a tractor trailor.  My father was the only one to survive and he slowly died of his injuries four years later - and I got to watch.  Do I think the man that did it should be sentenced to death?  What's the fucking point?  Ain't gonna bring back my uncle, or my cousin, or the friends of my family.  It's not going to make up for four years of watching my father die in pain, slowly.  Not a bit.  So when you say 'I bet your mind would change if it was YOUR family.&quot;  Well, it was; it was a whole lotta my family.  My mind didn't change.  That's just me.<br>
<br>
He'll get his in the end and it's not up to me to dish it out. If someone else wants to make that call, that is up to them.  I want no part of it.    <br>

And yes, Trech, the legal system is a bigger sham than the educational system.  BOTH are buracracies...<br>

This is blunt.. and will probably get a lot of flack but...<br>
<br>
Death penalty in it's purest form comes down to this.  You killed someone.  I don't trust you not to kill me.  To protect my life, I will kill you so you cannot endager mine.  <br>
<br>
Would I trust Timothy Mcveigh to respect my life in his future choices, absolutely not.  <br>
<br>
Would life imprisonment have the same purpose, I'm not qualified to answer that.  Personally I would much rather see the person killed so that other's lives were not in danger, even if they are prison inmates.<br>
<br>
Is this barbaric, or uncivilied.  Maybe.  However, I want to survive.  I want my family to survive.  The person who kills another human being denied that person that.  Are there circustanaces were the death penalty isn't warrented, yes of course.  We have the ability to reason, and for better or ill we use it.  If you intentionally kill someone however, there is nothing that forgives that.  There is no recompense you can do that will forgive it.  I don't care if you live a perfect sainted life, and cure cancer.  <br>

<br>
How it was done was not something I'd agree with. Why waste money on drugs when you can shoot a syringefull of air into his veins and get the same result?<br>
<br>
They broadcast the execution on closed circut TV for the friends and family of victims. One such viewer had some disturbing comments (that I saw on the news tonight). I can't quote him exactly.. but basically he said this. &quot;McVeigh showed no remorse for what he'd done. Infact he looked straight at the camera as if he was looking into my soul. His eyes looked black as coals.&quot; There was more after that but I'm not too sure on what it was and I don't want to misquote the guy.<br>
<br>
McVeigh was fucked in the head. Anyone hear what his last meal was? Two pints of Mint Chocolate Chip icecream. I'm not saying that in itself says he's fucked in the head, but I know *I* wouldn't pick that as *MY* last meal.<br>
<br>
I say we follow what George Carlin has to say on the subject. Public Executions on TV with Sponsors...<br>
<br>
Boiling in oil = sponsor Crisco<br>
Burning at the stake = sponsor Briquette Charcoal<br>

<br>
McVeigh should die and well did..I support that 100% and I think that he should have died the way that he made those others die. Personally I would have tied him to four horses and let the horses go.<br>
<br>
I have been the victim of violent crimes twice. The first time I really thought I was gonna die. Can I ever forgive them people..? No..They could have taken away a mother from a child. If they had killed me, would I have wanted them executed for it...you damn right. Then their family could have suffered just like mine would. Sounds vindictive doesnt it?...well it is.<br>
<br>
Do in all cases I support the death penalty?. No. because there are cases were the innocent are killed for things they did not do.  Do I think that DNA testing should be done on all the old cases? Yes, it might cost some money but several cases have already been reversed due to it..<br>
