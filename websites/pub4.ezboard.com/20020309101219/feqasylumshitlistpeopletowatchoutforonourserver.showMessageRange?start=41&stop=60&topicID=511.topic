Instead, I will show these 2 children of a lesser god the error of their ways.<br>
<br>
I belonged to a hardcore RP guild on Rodcet for many months.  We were all of the light races and deities.  Several other guilds were also straight-RP and were either of light or dark factions.  Each guild had an RP Council that would meet with the other RP Councils to determine storylines and such.<br>
<br>
We all got so deep into it that the GM's and Guides would get involved.  Once, during a multi-guild allianced war that had come into being from a great 2-month long story full of cross, double-cross, espionage and counter-espionage, abduction and counter-abduction/torture... we actually had over 10 of the &quot;special account&quot; Verant types present to witness it all unfold and an account of that day can be read by all Guides in the Guide Library.<br>
<br>
Our arch-nemesis was a guild of all DE's, with most of them being Necros or SK's.  Can you imagine the friction of something as simple as one member of each guild in the same place at the same time, such as at the auctions in the EC tunnel?  Whew - my heart still pounds fast thinking of those times.<br>
<br>
Our guild had multi-generation families complete with blood vengeances and all.  The DE's had clans and pacts of their own.  Imagine the crossover-ability of storylines...<br>
<br>
For months we had full RP-dom.  People laughed, cried, lived and died.  There was honor and treachery, courage and cowardice, triumph and defeat.  There were marriages and widows/widowers.  In short, it was EQ life at it's brightest or darkest depending on the day and scenario.<br>
<br>
Sounds like a hell of a time, doesn't it?  Especially for a game that, as has been pointed out, is not RP and weakly supports RP (if at all).<br>
<br>
Now, go back and read this post again.  Where in the description of 8 months of hardcore 24/7 RP across 7 guilds and massive zone-lagging guildwars did you see the words rape - meanness - degredation - KS'ing - training - cursing - petitions - - ad nauseam.<br>
<br>
The manner that these two attempt to pass off as RP is not RP at all.  It is the depraved activity of two young men with small minds, small personal parts and small ambitions.  As so many people do these days, these 2 wish to hide their depravity, immorality and ani-social behavior behind smokescreens and excuses.<br>
<br>
Do not be fooled, and more importantly DO NOT TOLERATE IT.<br>
<br>
Get logs - email them to Verant.  Get screenshots - email them to Verant.  They may go into the round file, but it builds their names in the right minds.  Send /reports and petition to let the Guides know to look for it.  Petition when you are ks'ed by them - even if they don't/won't come to investigate or actually do anything it gets their names in circulation among our server management team.  When you seem them in the same zone as you warn the zone in OOC about them.  Let's all do the one thing that we as fellow EQ players really can do in a situation like this - spread the word.  Spread it far, spread it loud, and keep spreading it until those with authority feel the pressure to listen.  Then and only then will we be rid of these two, because apparently they are like beaten dogs - they enjoy even negative attention and will not leave on their own.<br>
<br>
Be confident that I will do my part. <p><IMG SRC=http://www.vitainfinita.com/images/sigs/glassesig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyralstormfang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyral Stormfang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/16/01 6:52:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Roleplaying</span><hr size=1> I debated whether I would post the original message of this thread, as it had been perhaps a week or so since I had problems with these two.<br>

I'm glad I did. Now everyone can see just how incredibly pathetic these two are. OOC? This board is ONLY OOC. We don't post here for complaints IC. That would be incredibly stupid. You two broke the rules that Verant has laid down for the game. That's all I cared about.<br>
<br>
The fact that you two are Grade A assholes is just peachy as well. Maybe when you've grown up a bit, you'll realize just how stupid you were being, though I find this doubtful.<br>

Stop trying to roleplay on this board. That's not what is' here for. Defend yourself, OOC, or shut up.<br>

Are you too ignorant to understand the difference between a character and the RL person behind it?<br>
<br>
I myself play a DE cleric of Innoruuk, and my husband is a Troll shaman who worships Innoruuk. We are both EXTREMELY evil, and we are both fond of RP (Azz being almost rabid in his pusruit of it)  But you will never find us ruining the game play of another person.<br>
<br>
You've definately earned your spots here.  Goodluck to you in the future when you find yourself without Ports, rez's, heals, Sow's etc. <br>
<br>
If you like, Moerne can seek you out and show you the same &quot;FUN&quot; treatment you've been giving others.  After all, I HATE everybody.  It would fit in fine with my RP to take you down a notch. (Though this is something I would normally NEVER do - I don't get off on being a bully the ways these two do.)<br>

Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of &quot;Role-play&quot; will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors mentioned above. As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise) allowed to &quot;Train&quot; a guard onto an enemy in protection of your homeland. In another example, a rogue is not allowed to steal someone's corpse under the guise of role-playing a thief.<br>
<br>
By all means we want to encourage you to play your role, we just cannot allow that role-play to be done at another's out-of-game expense.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
there is a fine line in roleplaying.  if you are truly 'evil' to players in the game, you will be dealt with.<br>
<br>
as to your comments, i find them disgusting and reprehensible.  not as a player character, but as a human being.  issues such as rape are not to be dealt with so lightly in a game that is based upon social interaction.  Golg+Stoo, though this shitlist post might not survive (not really substantiated enough, and being a complete moron isn't a reason to be on the shitlist), our memories are pretty good.<br>
<br>
clean up your act. and keep your roleplaying within the guidlines of the rules.<br>

Ok how bout this one - Account suspension and banning.  Keep going the way you are and it will happen.  But hey, if you don't mind being out the money you payed to play this game, that's fine.  You'll be gone, and no skin off our noses. <p><center>

There are obviously a few things you bigoted faeries do not understand about me and my killing partner.<br>
<br>
A. We have never trained anyone. We stopped trains in CB. We did laugh at faeries yelling for help, but never pulled trains on people. We slaugter all opponents in our way, therefore KSing.  Exp is not an issue to us. We have not broken 20 with either character and dont really care when we do. We do not do things that are purely eq type asshole things in nature such as ninja loot, take loot from anothers kill. When grouped we stop looting all together.  We have given money away to aid our evil groupmates in their quest against the faeries.  We do this because we don't need the loot.  We are twinked. Our goal is not loot or exp.  It is fun. Its really a shame you faeries cant relax enough away from your exp gaining to notice that. You just might laugh. Forget rules and think out of the boundries for once.<br>
<br>
B. Anyone of an evil race that we have come across we have accepted into our group and welcomed their evil help in holding the throneroom and such.<br>
<br>
C. &quot;Evil&quot; roleplayers in this game, in my opinion, are not evil, they group with goodly folk, talk to them, and have a good time with them.  This makes them goodly, evil race/class or not. I've done a great deal of roleplaying OUT OF EQ and done so in many circles.  This was done either on a board, mostly with dice.  The kind of roleplaying you must create purely from stratch.  I have played good players, as in palidins and a ranger, and evil players such as orcs troll and oligi.  As I said above, its about time real evil roleplayers emerged.  I rarely break character in game or ON THE MESSAGE BOARD. I dont really care for your faerie opinion on that one.<br>
<br>
D. (and I know you faeries are going to jump all over this one) We are not the anti-social, hurt shut-ins you make us out to be.  We have a great time in game and I have broken character to talk with various players(on the goodly side) that find our antics entertaining. Though I would never group with them or talk to them in that manner in anything other than a tell.<br>
<br>
E. I know Im wasting my time here because most people that spend most of their time playing this game have made this truely part of their life, therefore the offensiveness of us comes into play.  This disrupts their virtual world balance of faeries and raids. Its called dependency. Addiction.  <br>
<br>
F. This game hinges on camping items and camping exp. God forbid you break that cycle.  Verant messed up this one by copping out to the easier, but you guys go along with it and have molded to it.<br>
<br>
G. BTW, it was fun playing with you on sister island Bone Caster.  Thanks for the heals.<br>

OOC: As for the banning goes.  I have had few conversations with the GMs and I don't think that's likely.  Some of our really vulgar stuff had to go but we are by and large ok to go on slaughtering things indescriminatly as long as it doesn't get &quot;too out of hand&quot;. &lt;snicker&gt; We don't do anything 'terrable' like training, scaming, nija looting and the like.  KSing ya I'll admit we have done our fair share of that.  However when camps are concered the PNP states you can't &quot;reserve a spawn&quot; so we are in the clear on that one.<br>

This is one such example when we owned the Throne Room in CB even though there was a full group and a lvl 32 warrior attempting to KS from us.  A real bummer that he wasn't able to because then we could have petitioned him LOL.  A duel did come out of this however I lost =(.  A high lvl druid had regened and throned my aponent.  Went down fighting though!<br>

Ya know its amazing what one can do at the tunnel and some patience.  Quite amazing. Foolish faerie, so narrow sited. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugolgothian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Golgothian</A> at: 5/16/01 11:55:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udastoowie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaStoowie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/16/01 11:48:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www21.brinkster.com/stoowie/stoowie.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yoos is so funny to laugh at!</span><hr size=1> We got all this equipment just by working the auctions if you can believe that!  Not only did we make enough to rightly twink our chars we also made quite a nice bit of profit.  We didn't scam anyone we just looked for the good deals had one computer checking prices and had patience’s more then anything.  Wait until you get your price.<br>
<br>
Yes I do have a main and no I won't tell you who it is.  I can name one person on this board, defiantly, who I've played with.  The trouble is a common thing among all societies and counter cultures such as EQ culture;  stereotypes, which lead to prejudice and discrimination.  In my defense for not posting my main's name I offer the following example of the trusted neighbor, coach of the little league team by day, and hardcore underground portstar by night.<br>
<br>
This person is well respected among his community, he is kind, honorable, gracious and charming.  He is an great coach and reliable when your in a jam.  A person we all would respect and admire.  However if we knew about his nighttime activities that image would change.  While it may simply be work he enjoys, our society, culture, counterculture, EQ culture, doesn't deem that as acceptable or 'right'.  In that aspect of his life he has not 'conformed' to the norms of society.  Therefore those that are closed in by these barriers of cultural behavior discriminate against this man despite his respectable and admirable behavior in all other aspects of his life.  We like people who are like us, however this also tends to limit our views.<br>
<br>
So while you may find my actions when roll playing one of the few true Ogre Warriors of Ralos Zek you may, without even knowing it, enjoy the company, reliability and charming nature of my main who goes out of his way to help others.  But if you could connect the two you would no doubt see the dark side over the good.  You'd take it to seriously and not be able to laugh at the craziness that follows in that other half’s wake.  Instead you would think only of he who has broken those &quot;sacred&quot; rules of our 'culture'.<br>
<br>
That's all I going to say about that.<br>
