I stopped because I didn't really feel that how I expressed myself was coming across the way I wanted it to and felt I was bothering people who misperceived what I wrote.  So I stopped.  Now, mind you, I have met some really nice people through this board who, ingame, have sent me tells saying how much they liked what I posted, etc., and that's cool but there were obviously people who did not care for what I said, either for reasons of opinion or feeling (wrongly) that I was attacking someone they cared about.  And until this weekend, I never thought for a second that what I had said here ages ago would in any way come up ingame.  <br>
<br>
My husband and I were ingame yesterday, just chatting comfortably with some old friends when I received a tell from a very close friend of mine.  He was in lguk and grouped with some nice people.  They had invited him to join them in Fear as soon as the portal was cleared.  He asked if we would like to go as well.  As we weren't otherwise engaged, we said sure, what the heck.  Pretty soon, he responds only to me saying one of the people he was going with stated to him that I did not like them.  He mentioned their name and I was thoroughly confused.  I told him that the only way I knew of this person was from this board and did not have any interactions with that person, let alone understand how that person came to the conclusion that I did not care for them.<br>
<br>
Now, personally, as a ranger, by the time the portal is cleared, I know that all the TT's (ranger armor drops) are done with as are most of the paladin drops (my husband), so realistically the only reason we were going was to help other people out, as we are prone to doing.<br>
<br>
Some time passed and we were never contacted about going up and that didn't bother us.  I know what things are like up there and how chaotic it can be and we merely assumed that there were plenty of people up there helping already.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
But later on, talking with my friend who was up there, it suddenly struck me that perhaps what someone perceived of me (from QQ board alone) had, in some way, affected the situation.  I did not mention it to my friend and thoroughly enjoyed hearing him talk about what was going on (setting up to do CT), as he had never been there for such a thing and I had.  <br>
<br>
Curiosity killed the cat so, being a tiger, I am curious.  Have others here been perceived unfairly ingame for something they might have said here?<br>

Truly, this text medium is horrible for conveying our intents and emotions.  When something is meant one way it is often perceived differently.

<br>
I think most everyone has a &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude.  Why would someone actually take the time to compose a reply or statement that they have no intention of standing behind?  Well, I guess there are always a handful, but for the most part, if I'm actually gonna &quot;waste&quot; my time, hopefully it'll have some sort of constructive aspect within.<br>
<br>
That being said... heh! I've read some of those questionable posts that people might take offense at.  No matter to me.  I thought some of them were funny.<br>
<br>
But what I do see on this board... not really a criticism... is that you see the same people posting day in and day out.  You've created your own little community here within the Quellious server.  It's not to say that there aren't a myriad of lurkers about, but nonetheless, even the general board is something of a channel where all you friends hang out and talk during the day.  I believe there was a post not too long ago where several of you stated that you constantly refreshed your screen to see if anything new might have been posted by an ingame friend.  Again... not a criticism... nothing wrong with that.  <br>
<br>
In creating this little community, you're comfortable with eachother and do not take offense at what one might say.  Among friends there are so many inside jokes and tales that the outsider cannot comprehend.  This is where you get hit with some bad noteriety; when someone reads something and it is taken completely out of context without the understanding that friends have with one another.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't worry about it much.  All those people that may misunderstand something have plenty of opportunities to get to know you.  Norrath is big... but not that big.  Everyone eventually comes to the same places, whether to trade, talk, or adventure.  You will meet them in one manner or another... and then they will have the opportunity to reevaluate their personal feelings toward you.  And if the camraderie you apparently have on this board is any indication of your true personality and disposition ingame... well, it's the poor misunderstanding fellow that harbors ill feelings that loses out.<br>
<br>
There is a saying that I cannot completely remember... something like...<br>
<br>
Hate is a terrible thing.  It can totally encompass a soul with dark thoughts and misfortune.  But who is really the more worse for wear?  The person who hates... or the person that is hated?  Often times, the hated ones have no idea that they are hated, hence has no regrets or thoughts on the matter... it is as if it never existed.  While, he who hates sits in turmoil, allowing their hate to eat away at their soul.<br>
<br>
It's an old saying... actually... I opened a fortune cookie and that's what it said... it was a big fortune cookie!  Ok... would you believe... a book?<br>

I have probably met a new person almost once a day that has recognized me from my posts here and just wanted to say hi.  *peers over to Tigeress*  I know people are a lot different in game from what they post, a lot of times that's because of roleplaying.  Well maybe except Tristadorn who really is a punkass *hugs*.  And well Krondath the gumpy old dwarf.  Hmmm well maybe I am wrong.<br>
<br>
Anyway, all I would like to say is that everyone has an opinion and people post those opinions on this message board.  Now sometimes those opinions run contrary to other peoples, hell I know I disagree on a lot of stuff from my best friends online.<br>
<br>
I would also like to say that the written word is very dangerous and left open to a lot of interpretation.  I look at how many misunderstanding we have had on the board where someone has had to reclaify a point.  I'm sure this happens in game a lot as well.  My point being, I would ask that everyone not judge someone from their posts or their stories on this board, but instead seek them out and find out what they are like for yourself in game.<br>
<br>
I know I am rambling so I will stop.  If anyone out there would like to meet the silly paladin who gets lost in the dark all the time, well feel free to send me a tell in the game or seek me out in SK.  I will be the one running around in the dark asking for a druid or ranger to track me and lead me out of there.<br>

I know this board has caused some hurt feelings, stepped-on toes, and animosity. I even know some of it is directed towards me. I can only say that I stand behind what I say. I may be wrong, and will admit it when shown to be so. Some of my best friends in-game were people I butted heads with initially. So much for gut instinct first impressions, huh?<br>
<br>
When I first met um, a certain person obsessed with spiffy robes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP-->  in-game I was nervous because we've expressed differing viewpoints here, and seemed to be on opposite &quot;sides.&quot; Overall I'd say the initial interactions were somewhat wary and cool, but no heads were bitten off. And in the process, I realized this person is rather like me, just running in a different circle of people, with a consequently different viewpoint. I can only regret that it took so long to cross paths, but I do look forward to the next time, and I hope that's mutual!<br>
<br>
Gads, I ramble, sorry. Anyhow, as they say, the pen (or keyboard) is mightier than the sword, and words can be strong weapons. It's easy to disagree, and disagree strongly in text posts. That doesn't mean the other person you disagree with is an evil ogre, and I can only hope most people realize this. Interacting with them directly, you might even find someone you like! <br>
<br>
In closing, I just urge people to give others the benefit of the doubt. Just because people disagree doesn't make them enemies. And that, basically, is why we at QQ don't like people being singled out negatively for flaming and name-calling. People <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> disagree and debate about even emotionally-charged issues without blatant hostility. It's to everyone's advantage to find common ground in aired grievances, and that's one thing we strive to accomplish here.</FONT><P>Tamas Sturmpanzer <BR>

Yes you are strong willed *cough*very*  And you speak your mind yeah, mouthy's a bad word to define it though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> . I personally wouldn't have it any other way. If you change you wouldn't be Tig, so keep on keepin on. People take things how they want too, most of the time at face value, so if they can't ponder it a little and realize whut you are really tryin to say, it's their loss. You've got so much to share, and so little time.<br>

Keep talkin you mouthy wench! I like it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>
