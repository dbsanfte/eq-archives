I wasn't clear though sorry, it was late (as it is now).  The quote I was referring to was actually not Dun's, but yours.  <br>
<br>
I was wondering if you believed everything the writer of that article wrote, the article you quoted (from infidels or something from the net).  Your post had quotation marks around it, so even though assuming is dangerous, I assumed the view posted was a quote from the actual article.  Correct me if I am wrong on that.<br>
<br>
Assuming the post was a quote from the actual article, I was curious if you believed all the views the writer expressed.  <br>
<br>
Its late, I'm tired, if you need a quote from your previous post cause I was not clear enough, it'll need to wait till tomorrow.  Nite.<br>

<br>
Ah, I see. Yes, I believe the facts the writer presents (which I did provide a link to the full article giving the writer credit). However, I do not entirely agree with his conclusion. While there is nothing *contemporary* to Jesus that would prove he existed I believe that there was a &quot;Jesus&quot; in virtue of the birth of the Christian Church and the subsequent writings about Jesus (some of which were canonized in the 4th century CE to become the &quot;New Testament&quot;). Was Jesus a man who existed? The evidence suggests that is not likely. Remember, historical personages do not need to have actually existed in order to influence cultures (take the Arthurian Legends as one example). It is more likely that the writer of the Pauline epistles invented the persona of &quot;Jesus&quot; during some very troubling times in that region of Palestine which eventually leads to the destruction of Jerusalem around 70 CE by the Romans. It is no surprise that the Pauline epistles are dated around the destruction of Jerusalem with the Gospels following. Such points to the invention of yet another &quot;Messiah&quot; to save the Hebrews from their terrible plight. <br>
<br>
So, the short answer is &quot;Yes, but...&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
If you count Biblical resources, it goes further than just the bible.  The Dead Sea Scrolls are dated to around 90 AD.  The Dead Sea Scrolls contain the bible in its entirety and its almost identical  to the one we use today.  These scrolls were found in a  cave near the dead sea (hence the name) and had been preserved for all this time - they were simply rolled up and put in clay jars.  I mean this is amazing!!!  <br>
<br>
Not trying to be offensive BUT - you really honestly think that an entire religion that grew in a grassroots movement, caused many to convert, caused the people to actually die for their beliefs, all occurring within 40 years of Jesus's death and rez - you think all of that was made up by one man?  Or the twelve disciples?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to be offensive to you, really I'm not, but it just boggles my mind that you may possibly discount all this other information.  Whether or not you actually believe in God, I just have a hard time accepting that.  (Notice I said MAY - I did see your &quot;but&quot;).  Its kind of like George Washington's mother.  How many records do we have of her, and what kind, etc, etc.  She obviously existed, but could you prove it to me?  And if I had problems with the authenticity of the records, does that in any way discount the fact that she gave birth to a son and he grew into our first President?<br>
<br>
I guess I'm done here.  I think that whether you believe in Jesus or not, it doesn't change the fact that in my opinion God does exist and he still died for you.  And I'm grateful cause it means he died for me too.  <br>
<br>
Good luck in life.  I really hope you find fullfillment in what you do believe in, even though we disagree on it.<br>

Lukaria, I am not sure what you mean by &quot;truly discount all other sources of that era&quot;? I think I provided a link that clearly explains why those &quot;other sources&quot; are either fraudulent or not trustworthy. It would be interesting to see you answer the paper I provided point by point.

<br>
Sorry, but the above is blatantly false. The Dead Sea scrolls do not contain the existing Christian canon. Indeed, that would be impossible given that the Christian Scriptures where not canonized until the 4th Century CE. Further, there are no explicit references to Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls. If you think Jesus is explicitly mentioned then please cite the reference.<br>

Yes. Care to explain the phenomenal growth of Islam? Did Mohammed really get caught up to heaven from the Dome of the Rock? Did he really recieve his vision from the angel Gabriel?

Well, we do have plenty of quality documents supporting the fact that there was a &quot;George Washington&quot;. That is evidence enough that he had a mother, I would say! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If we had the same quantity and quality of documentation for the life of Jesus as we did for George Washington I would accept the idea that Jesus was a real person. Fact, is we do not have such indisputable evidence concerning Jesus. There is not a single contemporary reference to Jesus, Mary, or Joseph for that matter. Not a single tax document, or any other legal document for that matter. There is not even a contemporary Roman reference to Jesus. Bah, I am done here!

1) Chrisitians use the same god as the relegions from India<br>

And after repeating myself 500 thousand times (at least it feels that way at times) I know other don't want to as well.  <br>
  I have thought about the same thing Hoppkins.  I personally think that, religion is an excercise for a balanced mental state.  Religion IMO being different from spirituality.  Now there are a few different ways I look at this:  one, there are elements in hinduism, buddhism, taoism, shintoism etc...(most every religion I know of) that are good.  Good meaning, the search for truth and love.  Two:  Christianity is a 'word'.  Its also known as an idea to the people who have been educated in its meaning.  BUT that does not mean hinduism, buddhism, taoism, shintoism etc... are not christian ideals.  They have the same desire for truth and love that God and Jesus represnt in Christianity.  So in a literary sense there is very little difference between all 'good' religions.  <br>
  I believe what you are ultimately refering to is the attitude some, so-called 'Christians' have when they exclaim, &quot;YOUR GOING TO HELL if you dont believe in Jesus&quot;.  Not sure about you but i want to rip their nuts off and nail them to a cross.  They make me sick to my stomach.  ULTIMATELY, everyone will know truth and love(IMO) through God and Jesus.I try my best 99% of the time to understand.  SO, it really doen't matter if you take the christian highway, the hindu express, the buddhist boat or the shinto chevrolet.  The path of love and truth eventually leads to the same destination.  I personally love the story of Jesus and want my life to reflect his and my death to reflect his.  The craziest thing about the world is how much love you have(or will have) for your children.  I would gladly die for my kids any day of the week.  But heres the crazy part of it.  EVERYONE is a child of someone.  We should all understand that every person on this board, every person at your workplace, every person in your neighborhood, every person in the world is a loved child of someone. You can't touch that kind of love with all the money/material in the world.  Nothing is more powerful.  And nothing can stop seekers of love and truth from getting to their destination.  No matter what 'word' they use to describe their beliefs.  The only thing that can be changed about the journey for love and truth is the path that is taken.  Take the short road for obvious reasons, take the long road if you insist on asserting your freewill.  Neither matter really.  Both are interesting/exciting and are full of all types of emotions.  At this point in my life, I am outside the castle of love and truth playing golf; ocassionaly 'slicing'(term used in golf indicating a 'foul ball', if you will) and breaking a window in God's castle.  Yea, I get the feeling he is bitching me out but I tend to laugh at him (similar to how I acted towards my parents when I was a teenager).  After a while, God redirects my golfball using the winds-of-truth and proceeds to pelt me in the ass with the past 50 balls I have sliced(most of the balls, mind you, were 'sliced' on purpose in order to test the boundaries of love and truth).  &quot;Damn that shit hurts&quot;  Then I ask for the band-aid of love and I get it.  Then immediately slice another ball on purpose and laugh my ass off.  <br>
  Anyway I'm sure you understand the analogy and can make your own story using many creative comparisons to describe your relationship.      <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhoppkins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hoppkins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/21/01 1:59:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you believe in god?</span><hr size=1> o.k intresting post...objective<br>

o.k another question:- <br>
<br>
If the devil is evil.....why does he punish evil people?<br>
<br>
Would it be gods place to punish evil ppl?  Why doesnt the devil welcome murderers etc with open arms like one of his own? <br>
<br>
The usually explanation is &quot;Because the devil hates everyone blah blah&quot;.  Nah thats just a preacher not wanting to think about a perfectly good question.  If the devil was indeed a angel cast out of heaven surley he would be wanting to get back at god in any way he could.  <br>
<br>
How is torturing evil ppl a way to piss god off?  Sounds to me that god and the devil are infact both good people....<br>

<br>
1) <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think I provided a link that clearly explains why those &quot;other sources&quot; are either fraudulent or not trustworthy. It would be interesting to see you answer the paper I provided point by point. Not that it will convince you otherwise<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You may have provided a link, but that doesn't make it true, Lurikeen.  I could provide lots of links and i am sure you would say they were not true.  You are basically stating that there is one writer who believes that these documents are false, and by stating they are false, it makes them so.  There are many other historians and scholars who do not consider these sources to be false.  I'm not the scholar.  You're not the scholar.  We didn't carbon date anything, but we read about it.  In the end, it doesn't really matter, it still comes down to the fact that you choose to believe that person's assessment and I do not.  You have based your opinions on sources, as have I.  As for answering the papers points point by point, I probably could find someone who does exactly that kind of thing and have them do it.  My point, is why?  If you think you might change your mind, then I'll do it.  If you are only making that statement to be difficult or to mock, then its not worth my time.<br>
<br>
2) You are correct in my mentioning that the scrolls do not contain the Christian canon in its entirety.  It contains the Hebrew Bible.  Which is part of the Christian Bible.  <br>
<br>
3) <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Indeed, that would be impossible given that the Christian Scriptures where not canonized until the 4th Century CE.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First,I am not sure what this has to do with the actual birth, death and rez of Jesus?  I mentioned the Dead Sea Scrolls as proof of the validity of the Bible (or parts thereof), carbon dated actually from 250 bc to 90 ad (some say 6<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  The earliest manuscript of Mark is actually dated to withing 20 years of Christ's death.  If you mention the canonization fo the Bible as evidence that Christ did not exist, well here is an answer for you which includes Old and New testament.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Canon<br>
This word is derived from a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a reed or cane. Hence it means something straight, or something to keep straight; and hence also a rule, or something ruled or measured. It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote that they contained the authoritative rule of faith and practice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to be of canonical authority when it has a right to take a place with the other books which contain a revelation of the Divine will. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiastical authority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship of the book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Old and New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, of faith and practice. They contain the whole supernatural revelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formed gradually under divine guidance. The different books as they were written came into the possession of the Christian associations which began to be formed soon after the day of Pentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all the books were gathered together into one collection containing the whole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books. Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the second century this New Testament collection was substantially such as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved to have, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus the whole is of divine authority.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
(Do me a favor and don't argue the point above that these books were not divinely inspired. we already know you dont believe it.)<br>
<br>
4) <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Further, there are no explicit references to Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls. If you think Jesus is explicitly mentioned then please cite the reference.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The Messiah is explicity mentioned many times.  jesus us not mentioned by name, only the Messiah.  I can, however, give some arguments for you of examples.  Here are two arguments 1) the scrolls contain Isaiah in its entirety, all books.  There are predicitons of the messiah in these books regarding who he would be, what he would do, when he would arrive, how he would die, and when for all of these things, specifically Is. 53 to name one.  There are over 700 specific predicitons regarding the coming of the Messiah in the Old Testament, and its amazing that Jesus fullfilled them all (of course in my view, you might argue that point, I understand this).  2)  The other mention is actually a non-biblical manuscript called 4Q521.  There is an added phrase that mentions wonders the Messiah would do when he came, namely &quot;the dead will walk.&quot;  It is later in Christ's life and recorded in Matt. 11:4-5 , that Christ answers when questioned regarding who he was &quot;Go back and report to John what you hear and see:........the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.&quot;  (Omission of some lines mine cause I didnt want to type them, see Matt. 11:4-5 for full text).  Clearly, Jesus was asserting himself as that he was the Messiah, fullfilling the Messianic prophecy mentioned in the scrolls. I find it amazing that Jesus said this and that we later find it recorded in a book of Is. that predates jesus.  it isnt as if jesus read this and said to himself, &quot;let me make sure to say that so that I am fulfilling a prophecy so I can scam the people of the world into thinking I am the Messiah.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats as good as the mentions of Jesus are in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Lurikeen.  However, let me point out again, that when I was mentioning the Dea Sea Scrolls, it was in reply to your claims (well sorry not yours that writers which you believe) that not only did Jesus never live, but that the entire Christian religion was made up by a few men.<br>
<br>
I have one quote for that which I find awesome.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The popular historian Will Durant, himself not a Christian, wrote concerning Christ's historical validity, &quot;The denial of that existence seems never to have occurred even to the bitterest gentile or Jewish opponents of nascent Christianity&quot; (Durant, The Story of Civilization, vol. 3, p. 555). And again, &quot;That a few simple men should in one generation have invented so powerful and appealing a personality, so lofty an ethic and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far more incredible than any recorded in the Gospels&quot; (Ibid., p. 557). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
5) You bring up other religions and their validity.  Of course I don't believe that these other religions are 100% true. I certainly do not believe that Mohammed performed any miracles.  And no, I don't believe that the book of Mormon is correct.  If someone could give me as much hard evidence as I have for Jesus, I would look at these other religions again.  I helped a friend investigate these other religions, nothing else made sense to me Lurikeen.  However, that is not so for everyone. Just because I believe in one God who became flesh does not mean that I don't think that people have a right to believe what they want or that I am intolerant.  I simply do not choose to believe what they do.  I am sure that people of other religions would find me misguided and would not have any problem telling me so.  I would not believe they were being malcious or mean or arrogant, I simply would think they were misguided. What I think the problem really is here is that you do not want me to open my mouth.  Its fine if I believe what I want as long as I keep my mouth shut and don't share it. Well, sorry Lurikeen, but thats silly.  You share your views and I find them valid and well thought out.  I am simply doing the same.  I think you boggle my mind because I feel you are refusing to investigate, and I bet I boggle your mind because you just cannot believe what I do.<br>
<br>
I will finish here with a quote to you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The kind of evidence used in historical research is the same kind as that used in a court of law. In a courtroom case certain kinds of evidences are appealed to in order to determine what exactly happened, eyewitnesses are questioned, motives are examined, and physical evidence is scrutinized such as fingerprints or journal writings. <br>
<br>
It is the same kind of evidence that we appeal to in order to establish Christ's life, death, and resurrection. Granted, the evidence is not as great as that for Lincoln, nor as recent. But it is better evidence than we have that Plato ever lived, or Homer, or many historical figures that we take for granted.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For me, the evidence was enough to convince me when I had doubts, and yes of course, I have had them.  I am not intolerant of other religions, but this thread was specifically devoted to the belief in the existence of God.  I am not the one who started the debate, but sure I love discussing these things with people, not because it gives me a chance to go preach (I am not good at that) but because I get to have a stimulating conversation with other people.<br>
<br>
I must in the end, thank you.  you have made me look up answers to questions and investigate my faith in order to attempt to debate with you, and it has truly deepened my belief and my faith and my conviction.  I know you don't believe as I do, thats ok Lurikeen.  I still wish you well, I still think you are a worthy human being.  I still hope you find fulfillment in this life.<br>
<br>
I've said I'm done a hundred times, but this time I really am.  i truly only came back because I discovered I had ommitted a major point when speaking on this issue and I needed to correct that.  Like I said, I'm not a scholar, I enver pretended to be.  i think that there are plenty of books out there who could debate these issues better than I with you Lurikeen, if you really truly want to know more or debate more, then let me know through email, and i will pass your information along to someone who is more gifted in thsi area than I.<br>
<br>
Best Wishes to you in life,<br>

At first blush I would say your response was very tense and I can understand why. So let me just say that I will not be turning this into a flame. I know you are &quot;swearing off the thread&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but I hope you do read the following. Before I get started I thank you for the offer to email you. I extend the same offer to you &lt;pierce@speakeasy.net&gt;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You may have provided a link, but that doesn't make it true, Lurikeen. (...)

<br>
I provided a link only to give credit to the scholar who wrote the paper. I even went so far to state that I disagree with his conclusion. Are you sure you read my post carefully? Also, I am not saying because &quot;one writer who believes&quot; documents are false makes the documents false. Again, carefully consider what it was that I actually wrote. I will repeat, there are no documents contemporary to Jesus when he allegedly lived that speak of him or his family. Zero documents. The later documents that purport to speak of Jesus are either fraudulent (as is the case with the Josephus insertions) or not trustworthy. I provided you with just one internet source. I can provide you with a long standing list of scholars who agree with my assesment? Many of which are &quot;liberal Christians&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You are correct in my mentioning that the scrolls do not contain the Christian canon in its entirety. It contains the Hebrew Bible. Which is part of the Christian Bible.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope. That is not true Lukaria. The dead sea scrolls contain fragments of specific books found in the Christian Old Testament. The Hebrew canon was not agreed upon until the Second Century CE so could not possibly contain the &quot;Hebrew Bible&quot; as you say. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;First,I am not sure what this has to do with the actual birth, death and rez of Jesus?

<br>
It has a lot to do with it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  First, the early Christian church could not agree with what texts should be considered &quot;authoratative&quot;. Many different texts and oral traditions were floating about. Some of which claimed Jesus never died on the cross, that he was not crucified, that he had married and has children, etc. To this day, Lukaria, scholars are still skeptical as to whether or not the book of Revelation should be kept in the canon! The point is that the literature you turn to and use as &quot;evidence&quot; is really shaky at best. It is not contemporary to Jesus, the authors are unknown, the originals of the texts are lost forever, and what fragments and manuscripts are available have been grossly tampered with by scribes through out the ages. I read the quote you provided, too. Who are you quoting? Looks like a piece by Josh McDowell. At any rate, I can quote other Christian scholars who would flagrantly disagree with the source you provided.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The Messiah is explicity mentioned many times. jesus us not mentioned by name, only the Messiah. I can, however, give some arguments for you of examples.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I am not even going to get into the so-called proof you offer based on the fullfillment of prophecies. Christians can't even agree on the nature of the prophetic content found in the Christian bible. I want to point out that there are several &quot;Messiahs&quot; mentioned by both the Hebrews and Romans around the time Jesus purportedly lived. A precursory understanding of biblical history would show you that the Hebrew traditions found in their apocalyptic writings always contain references to Messiahs generically as individuals who save them from their enemies. Interpretation of biblical references is a daunting task which has lead to the formation of hundreds of schisms in the Christian church throughout history. I would not pretend that there is a monolithic Christian view or interpretation of the Bible. At any rate, Jesus is not explicitly mentioned in the Dead Sea scrolls and Messianic references contained there in will not be helpful either, since the question will always be &quot;Which Messiah is being referred to?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You bring up other religions and their validity. Of course I don't believe that these other religions are 100% true.

<br>
The point I raised Lukaria was a good answer to your question as to whether or not I believed that the Christian religion could be &quot;made up&quot; by a few people. Even you agree that Islam and even Morminism have been &quot;made up&quot; by individuals. Hence, it is not impossible that Christianity was also invented by a group of people. We certainly see that the major religions are created by the inspiration of individuals carried through time by their followers. Right? Why should Christianity be exempt? You see, I have never understood why some Christians are so caught up with needing historical proof to validate their faith. Why would a Christian really care if the bible is just a collection of fairy tales? Isn't the message contained in the pages what's important? /shrugs<br>
