It isn't to start a flaming war against any guilds. Frankly some of the stories about poaching that I have heard are despicable.  People are promised things from guilds and sometimes the guild does deliver and sometimes it doesn't deliver. Having been the leader of a guild and since relinquishing it, I saw many forms of poaching. In fact I was approached by one of the guilds mentioned in this thread to join them while I was a guild leader.<br>
The reason I asked for people to name guilds was so they were specific in showing that poaching is going on. Some of the funny things that happened in this thread is people posting about how bad other guilds were, while at the same time I have seen their own guild poach as well. Hypocrisy is everywhere.<br>
I have taken some time lately and have done a bit of research on guilds of players over level 50. For the most part there are only a couple substantial guilds that are truly 50 plus and maybe between 7 to 10 that are truly higher level (55 plus).  These guilds have a multitude of players and continue to grow.  I have seen players approached to join these guilds from every angle- friends, inviting them on raids, needs, epics, loots, promises, tells directly from the leadership and a few other methods. In fact, guilds are using any method now to get players to join who are already guilded. <br>
<br>
Let me take a minute to explain what is happening on this server. The smaller guilds are all starting to fade away because of the power/poaching of the larger guilds.  There are also a larger quantity of level 60s floating around unguilded saying that they arent interested in joining any guilds  because of the crap and the politics that have gone on in guilds. Quite frankly, there are some problems on our server as too many guilds are becoming too big now. I have spoken with people who were friends with each other before but arent now because their guilds had to fight over a camp. I have a lot of respect for the people that I'm speaking of,  but it is absolutely ridiculous that friends shouldn't speak with each other because of the power struggles of their guilds over a piece of land.  I have seen posts in here concerning guilds trying to get their 11th cleric epic but yet denying a smaller guild the chance to get their first cleric epic. This is what occurs when guilds become large. The guild leaders honestly try to control the problems but the but the strength of their numbers makes power all the more sought after by these guilds. And at what cost? Well there are a lot of people who made friends in the game and they have subsequently lost those friends from  guilds' attempts to become stronger and more powerful. <br>
<br>
I don't place all this upon the guilds either, players are content with following the promises of what sizeable guilds offer them.  In fact I wonder exactly how many players are actually familiar with the charters of their own guild. I hear time and time again players saying- when I turn 55 I'm going to join XX guild. This is what I have to say to these players- &quot;Stop wasting the time and energy of all of those other people who are putting in the effort to try to make the game enjoyable for you.&quot;  95% of officers and players care about their guild and really wish to keep it viable. If you don't wish to commit to a guild- don't join them in the first place. Once you commit to a guild, make sure it is a guild that you wish to commit to, if in that time the guild changes that isn't your fault. But everytime you make a commitment to a guild, there are many other people who rely upon your commitment.  In spite of this I see people going off and joining guilds to get loots and loots and loots despite the fact that they have friends they are leaving behind.<br>
<br>
To all of those poaching guilds- have some respect for other guilds and the friendships that have formed in them.  Let your philosophy be publicly known, but stop asking guilded players to leave their current guilds.  If your philosophy is strong enough the players will come to you.<br>
<br>
To all of those players who break commitments to join a more powerful guild- stop thinking about yourself first- start thinking about others when you do this.  Think about the many others in your guild who have left for the same reasons you are leaving and then realize if you had all stayed in the guild you would probably be able to accomplish some of those things you wanted to accomplish anyways. Have some sense of accomplishing something and actually being a part of something.  Joining a guild that can already zerg the hell out of mobs hasn't made you a better player- it simply is a way to get free, easy equipment. I contend that it is much more meaningful to actually be a part of earning something, to be a part of growth.  The name of this game is EverQUEST, not EverHANDOUT. Take a little time and make it mean something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujexielia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jexielia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1026<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/23/02 4:54:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3655.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:Poachers</span><hr size=1> I can personally say that AA tried to convince me to leave the guild I was in when they formed, and it wasnt a "Hey are you interested..." it was more of a "Your guild sucks!
