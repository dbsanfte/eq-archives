<br>
<br>
The only reason for posting this is to get the limelight for a while. Not that you don't have plenty of it in other threads. Sadly,  this throws you smack dab in the middle of the "troll" category.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for not saying it is the presidents fault,  but the party itself.  Yes, your initial post indicates disdain for the party, albeit in a roundabout way.<br>
<br>
However, the rest of your responses indicate presidents as being reasons or basis of comparisons, and thus it is quite natural for normal people to extract that you are blaming the president.  Quite frankly,  you are.  However, reading enough of your posts it is painfully obvious you will not understand that simple tidbit so Iam not expecting any miracles here.<br>
<br>
I am however amazed that you need so much attention that the other threads are not good enough,  you needed to start up your own to feed your need for chaos and discord.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact that economic effects are rippled throughout administrations is an old, old concept.  Taught in many economy classes as a contributing factor.  That is contributing, not sole.  That means that it does have an effect but is not the sole reason for an economic growth or decline.<br>
<br>
Outside of that,  9-11 had an impact (Hardly the republicans fault),  as does corporate america getting caught with their pants down.  Investors are backing away out of mistrust in major companies.  Smaller companies are unable to find funding due to the mistrust investors are having.  People are unable to find jobs because the companies are losing investors and thus are unable to staff as they wish.  It really is quite simple to see.   Guess what,  this is not the republicans fault either.   This is the corporations screwing it up for the rest of us.   Also,  Bush got screwed by this also.  Granted,  he isn't the brightest guy we have had in office. . but even he would not do thing such to screw himself.<br>
<br>
Anyway,  I don't know why I am even trying to explain this to you. You have your beliefs, and are incapable and unwilling to try any other thoughts than your own because you are all knowing and all powerful. <br>
<br>
Let me save you the trouble by the way.   I have not offered any valid proof,  I do not know my history,  I do not know how businesses are run,  you are not trying to get attention that is the misguided perception of a weak minded person like myself.  You want solid evidence where you said that bush was the problem, otherwise I should STFU....I need to stop listening to Rush (Didnt even know he was still doing his thing, that is how much I listen btw)....  I need to stop beign delusional or whatever your word of the day calendar has up at the time...  <br>
<br>
I am sure I missed some but these are the basic ideas behind most of your responses to anyone who disagrees with you so I figured I would help ya out and let you work on some new ones.<br>
<br>
Enjoy, and have a great day.<br>

Just taking some issues from your own post:<br>
Who controls the House? Who refuses to enact the campaign finance reform?<br>
Which party falls lockstep into position the instant that ANYONE mentions<br>
corporate controls? If a serious bill was entered to constrain business in any way<br>
I have absolutely no doubt it would be fillibustered to death.<br>
The current justice department lets Microsoft off the hook when they are CLEARLY GUILTY. Years of litigation wasted. MS has not altered what it does one iota except how it handles internal memos.<br>

but no one is raising taxes to pay for it.<br>
<br>
I live two blocks from the unemployement office. It is sad to see the line in the morning when I drive to work. I have personal freinds that have been out of work in their field for over a year. I use to have 14 freinds working at Nortel, I now have <br>
ONE. He is bailing on his own with the comment 'why wait around to be wacked'<br>
<br>
These are good people my freind, even if you insist on not liking me, surely you admire talent. They work at McDonalds to pay the rent. Some had to sell with just 15% equity. Yet oddly enough the right goes blythly on ignoring what is happening.<br>
<br>
And all I hear out of the White House is posturing for re-election. I dont want to hear that. I want to hear how he intends to solve the unemployment. Bin Laden can wait.<br>

A very simple solution to most of the woes is to cut programs that don't work, get rid of government waste and have a flat tax. We could save billions and get the people back their money.<br>

As for campaign finance reform, it is illegal and goes against the very foundation of the Bill of Rights.

That is the most idiotic statement I've ever read in my entire life!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE learn some history before you start stuff like this!  Not only does it NOT MATTER which party was in power during this time (they were both radically different than they are today), but the Democratic reforms that FDR used were opposed by most of the members of BOTH parties.  That's right, your prescious Democrats didn't like the idea of the government getting all involved in everyone's life.<br>

<br>
As far as the current economic situation, I place a good share of the blame on slicky Willy for 2 reasons:<br>
<br>
1)  Failure to deal with Bin Laden<br>
<br>
I think it was '96 when Bin Laden was offered up to the U.S. government.  He had been captured and was being held by the Sudanese government.  Clinton said to let him go.<br>
<br>
2)  Urging the Fed to raise interest rates during the end of his administration<br>
<br>
The economy was doing great during the years that the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress.   Given the fact that Clinton was a huge embaressment for the Democrats, as well as the country, the Democrats realized that the Republicans were going to get the White House.<br>
<br>
With this knowledge, and their plans to start regaining control of Congress in 2002 and Congress/Presidency in 2004, Clinton started urging Greenspan to raise the Fed dramatically.   Clinton's economists realized that the slowing down of the economy wouldn't take place until a year or so down the road.  Then the Democrats could claim that the slowing of the economy was the Republicans fault.<br>
<br>
Just as predicted, the economy seriously started slowing down right about the time that Bush was taking office.  Even without 9/11 tradegy and more recent corporate scandals, the economy would have slowed down.  One of the first things Bush did when taking office was to start putting pressure on Greenspan to lower the Fed.  You are already starting to see major signs that the economy is looking better.  Because of 9/11 and recent scandals the recovery will take a bit longer, but you will see the economy really booming again by late/spring early summer of next year.<br>

<br>
Yeah right, and of course Greenspan will just let that happen right?<br>
You realize that Bush could fire him any time and put someone he likes in?<br>
<br>
Yeah I am sure that if Bush invades Iraq and the timming is right and he fabricates enough evidence to show that he saved the world, your right he will get re-elected. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

<br>
The average stock portfolio is now worth 75% of what it was about 2 years ago...<br>
<br>
I dont believe that any politician democrat, republican or other would put politics ahead of his own wallet in any case.<br>
<br>
Alan Greenspan is a Republican, Clinton could have appointed a democrat to replace him but was smart enough to realize that Dr. Greenspan is the best person for the job.<br>

Instead you put it here.  You KNEW what was goign to come of it,  come on now.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for me insisting on not liking you.  To use your own stance,  nowhere did I say I do or do not like you.  In fact, I have no feelings either way really.  If I didn't like you or more so hated you, then I would do what Raed does and attack you at every opportunity.  In fact it is quite the opposite.  Some of your posts DO have some good points, thoughts, reasoning, rational. <br>
<br>
On to the heart of the matter.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to hear about your friends who are unemployed,  and that is genuine.  I myself and some friends have gone into business for ourselves after being laid off back in october and jobs in our field just not existing.<br>
<br>
So, also having quite a few friends out of work, I to would love nothing more than to lay a concrete blame, point a determined finger at a single cause for the problems.   It just can't happen though.  As much as we would like it to, it just can't.  Not this time around.<br>
<br>
A lot of the blame can be laid at the feet of investor confidence.  They have none.<br>
<br>
Now you brought up Microsoft.  Microsoft has nothing to do with this.  They are in a league of their own.  Personally, as crazy as it sounds, Ithink they are trying to do as much as possible that is "questionable" to keep the courts as busy as possible and not be able to ever truly pin them down on anything.  They however will do it to themselves, I know of 4 major companies in this area who are either investigating, or moving into the phase where they can move away from an MS based company. That is a different rant however ;)<br>
<br>
Yes, the president has effects on the economy (the president meaning the administration currently in office).   I won't say republicans over democrats or vice versa because quite honestly the whole party division thing is a waste of time and does nothing more than support lines of opposition.  I think they should do away with the whole party system all together.  They don't mean what they used to, at least not as clearly as they used to.<br>
<br>
Foreign economies also have an effect on our economy.<br>
Consumer spending.<br>
Investor Confidence.<br>
Corporate growth.<br>
War.<br>
<br>
All have effects on our economy.<br>
<br>
Foreign economies,  I dont think have a great deal at this time to do with anything.<br>
<br>
War.  Yes,  the whole afgahn thing is definatly having an effect.  Can bush (Shrub.. hehe cute),  back out now?  Until his advisors tell him too, no.  (Remember a Pres and an administration is only as good as it's advisors).  The bulk of the people still want us there.  Likewise,  everyone condemned daddy Bush, AND Clinton for getting involved in things like this and not finishing the job.  Bush started it with binnie boy,  how can he back out without it being done?  Just devils advocate there for a min.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at the last three.  Just to see what that does to us.<br>
<br>
The situation:<br>
    Corporate america has taken a major beating over the last few quarters.   9-11 has effected corporations in MANY ways, but then along comes the sudden realization that big business is not on the straight and narrow.  Yes so far only a handful have been questioned (Worldcomm, Enron, Arthur Anderson, Merck, etc etc..  yes Merck was absolved but they were added for a day or two.).  These companies are tanking, investors are gettign MAJORLY screwed.  Investor confidence is shakey.<br>
<br>
Investors are not investing like they used to.  Companies have to have income to grow.  One of these sources of income are investors. Contrary to popular belief it is a biggie too.<br>
<br>
Now,  after 9-11 unemployment took a major hit.  It would be up to the administration and corporate america to bring it back.  Administration too busy dealing with how to heal the wounds so now it is up to corporate america.  Corp america is losing backing, being forced to cut jobs.   People out of work can't spend.  Corporate america loses consumer spending,  corporate growth stalls.  We are stuck in a nasty circle.<br>
<br>
Can the administration change this?  Yes.  When? When the majority of the people stop crying for revenge and start crying for our countries growth.  Right now, (and justifiably so) they want blood.   <br>
<br>
SO what is all of this to say?  Simply that there are MANYMANY factors in an economy.  While the administration does have effects,  right now. . our current situation... there are so many negative forces on the major factors of our economy, that we are in deep @#%$ until some MAJOR changes occur.<br>
<br>
In adminstration, in business, in general.  I don't think the administration can do enough on it's own to fix this.  Some blame, and some responsibility has to be laid on the corporations as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
I could just as easily post a list such as this:<br>
<br>
The Right: Violates civil liberties<br>
The Left: Preserves civil liberties<br>
<br>
The Right: Violates seperation of church and state<br>
The Left: Upholds the framers' intent.<br>
<br>
The Right: Supports racial disparity and discrimination<br>
The Left: Supports racial equality<br>
<br>
The Right: Supports profits at the expense of workers wages<br>
The Left: Supports decent worker compensation<br>
<br>
...I could go on.  However, this list would be totally bunk.  Just like, in fact, the piece of crap you just tossed up.  I know conservatives who are vile, contemptable individuals, and I know those who are genuinely appalled at some really stupid things the liberal movement has done.  I also know liberals who are vile, contemptable individuals, as well as those who are really interested in social justice in a way your average Ditto-head cannot understand or empathize with.<br>
<br>
The biggest mistake people make is trying to group folks into either category, and then having a field day with the stereotypes and charicitures.  Finding someone who in personal life emulates your notions of the stereotypical liberal or conservative is nigh on impossible, it is very hard to find someone who totally swallows whatever the ideological party line is they are most associated with.<br>
<br>
For instance, your post sure as heck does not make me think less of the right, but it goes a long way towards pointing out some well-entrenched brainwashing in whatever is passing for your psyche.  Grow up, look at the facts, and try and think a little bit more independently than what ideologue_01 told you on the radio.  That list was a freaking joke, just like the one above. <p><center><IMG SRC=" http://www.unicorntrad.org/mal_sig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udawnen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/17/02 12:39:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair enough</span><hr size=1> Ghie - I started getting scared around Nov '99.  It is true I could have waited a bit longer to pull out and made a bit more money, but now my decision to bail when I did looks pretty good.  If I could figure it out I'm sure these big wigs did too.  You don't see billionaires on the news complaining about how much money they lost.  The ones that got hurt were the average uneducated mutual fund holder crying about how they thought the ride was going to last forever.  <br>
<br>
The ones urging for interest rate hikes were well aware of what was going to happen and I'm sure they moved a large percentage of their wealth into bonds/real estate and other such investments to weather out the storm.<br>
<br>
Malevant -  I have looked at the facts and I stand by my assessments.   Granted, when I was young and idealistic I used to believe the lies and fear tactics used by the Democrats.  I used to believe in Santa Claus back then also.<br>
<br>
But then I grew up and started trying to find out the truth for myself.  It wasn't easy to find the truth.  Most americans don't read any further than the headlines of the liberal controlled media.  But some of us are willing to put forth the time and effort to dig a little deeper.  <br>
<br>
That is what I suggest to all americans do before they vote.  Do the research.  Put forth the effort.  Don't take anything at face value. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaelie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caelie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/17/02 1:06:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair enough</span><hr size=1> Malevant, that could go on forever. Bottom line is what a person is looking for from their government or how they interpret the Constitution.<br>
<br>
Just because I'm a right winger doesn't mean I'm against racial equality. Difference is, I don't think its the Governments place to step in and tell employers who they have to hire.<br>
<br>
 Its not the governments place to support people forever with Welfare. Do I feel pity for the less fortunate? Of course I do, but thats where friends and family should come in and help care for them. Most Republicans feel that as long as the Government is taking care of people, why would the have any incentive to do better? When do people stand up and try to do better? I know if I was cold and hungry and not getting help from the government, I would definately try to better myself. I don't think anybody is saying that Democrats or Republicans are any better or any worse than the other. The whole argument is about each individuals opinion on how things should be run.<br>
<br>
Real Life government should be like the game EQ. What does the government do in EQ? Provides a military. Did EQ just give us stuff or did we have to earn it? Do they force the good and the evil characters or the black and white characters to play together. No, we do that on our own. <br>
90% of the players out there are genuinally good people and I'm sure we're not all of the same party. Yeah, EQ has its share of terriorists (KS'rs; Intentional Trainers; but they're delt with in time. I buff newbies in Misty Thicket, but not because the EQ government tells me I have to. I do it because I want to.<br>
<br>
I'm not a Right winger thats way out there. I even support seat belt laws, helmet laws, car seat laws etc. but I don't believe in hand-outs and thats what seperates me from the Left wingers that are way out there.<br>
<br>
My whole point is that this guy can't go pointing fingers at Bush no more than we can go pointing fingers at the Clinton administration just because they're not the party of his choice. As one guy posted, several factors have caused the decline in the economy. As far as Democraps, I was refering to Clinton specifically and those that condone his behavior. Theres a democrat in Georgia that I would vote for in a heartbeat if he was to run for President and thats Zell Miller. <p>Caelie<BR>
