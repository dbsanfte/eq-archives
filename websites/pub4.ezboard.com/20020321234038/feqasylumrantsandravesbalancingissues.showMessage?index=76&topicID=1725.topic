<br>
As many people know, I'm sick in real life. (Besides the asthma which developed in my 20s <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I have psuedo-tumor cerebri. What this is basically is increased fluid in the brain. It's all the same symptoms of a brain tumor (which also increases pressure) with no mass.<br>
<br>
Cause? Unknown. Treatment? They can only treat the symptoms, which means I take a dieretic which lowers the amount of fluid overall in my body, and vicoden for the pain from the headaches. The fluid levels aren't constant, they flucuate. So some days it's fine, other days it hurts like shit.<br>
<br>
Now, this illness causes a variety of problems. The two main problems though are blindness, and severe head pain. I was diagnosed with it when I lost half the vision in my left eye. (Which later returned). They can also do serial spinal taps to preserve vision, and optic nerve fentration (where they nick the optic nerve to prevent blindness from the pressure, it allows the fluid to seep). They can also put in a shunt.<br>
<br>
The surgical options have too many problems, IMO. So I've refused them. <br>
<br>
Now, here's the real bitch. Last year for probably a month and a half I had headpain constantly on a nine scale. (10 being the worst). EVERY FUCKING DAY. The painkillers were not doing shit. The medication was not doing shit. Spinal tapping is pretty useless because the fluid level can be back at a high level within 24 hours.<br>
<br>
I was researching every possibility....guess what also works for PTC? Marijuana. There are several cases out there where PTC completely resolved, because marijuana lowers the CSF pressure.<br>
<br>
And as many of you also know, my husband is a police officer. <br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
I could give a shit about getting high. That ceased to have any real amusement after college. However the medicinal properties of marijuana are largely ignored. And even though California (where I live) has medicinal marijuana laws, they're not federally recognized. Which means I could face federal charges if I used it. Any doctor prescribing it could also face federal charges.<br>
<br>
And more importantly, my husband could lose a career he loves.<br>
<br>
I wasn't so much concerened with any consequences I would face. I have a HUGE amount of documentation that I have this illness. Numerous tests, numerous doctor visits. I sincerely doubt I'd have faced anything more serious than a fine.<br>
<br>
But I was faced with a shitty dilema. I couldn't go on with the headaches at that level. You have such a high degree of pain for so long, you seriously start weighing anything as an option. Not to mention how suicidal you can become when you have blinding pain on a daily basis with no end seemingly in sight.<br>
<br>
But my actions wouldn't have effected just ME. They would have effected someone else. I would have had to use marijuana behind his back, in such a way that I could <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> prove</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> he never would have known. I have some personal issues with doing that.<br>
<br>
I also would be risking other people. As sick as I was, I had several friends, and even a family member offer to help. What if they had been arrested?<br>
<br>
Fortunately before I had to make a decision, the pain stopped. It still hits those high points, but generally it's no longer than three days. I can live with that. <br>
<br>
I also have no problem with breaking a law I disagree with...and accepting the consequences for doing so. I'm a huge believer in taking personal responsibility for yourself, and in standing up for what you believe in. <br>
<br>
Yet, it wouldn't just involve <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It would have involved other people I deeply care about. It basically REALLY sucked. And I refused to allow it to impact other people in that manner. Even though they were willing, I was not.<br>
<br>
People who want to abuse drugs will find a way to do so. I don't think we should make it legal on that basis. The amount of damage done to numerous facets of people, property and society by some narcotics is obscene. Just as I don't think we should legalize car theft just so more people aren't hurt by pursuits, I don't think we should legalize crack cocaine to deal with the symptoms of that drug trade.<br>
<br>
However I do think more needs to be done, and more needs to be looked at regarding the medicinal purposes of some illegal drugs. It's absolutely stupid that someone cannot use or have made available to them something that would work if it was the best thing, or the only thing that would help them in an illness.<br>

<br>
I've seen 3 seperate neurologists, and had 3 seperate cat scans to see why I have them.  All they can say is &quot;yes, you have migraines&quot;.  Further diagnosis would require cutting my head open, so no thanks.<br>
<br>
Doctors have prescribed ibuprofen (800mg tablets), midrin (think tylenol-2), tylenol-3, hydrocodone, vicodin and miscellaneous other painkillers for them.  None work except in mass quantities (naturally high tolerance for everything <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Pot works.  Pot works WONDERS.  It makes the pain go away, and stay away for days at a time.  I confided in my doctor about this, and he said to smoke it whenever i needed it, but he could not provide it. <p><center>

<br>
If you want to change the constitution or the USC you are more then welcome to.  There is a process to change those laws.  You can A) pass another bill striking the law out of the USC or you can pass an amendment to the constitution .  But that will not change until most of the baby boomer generation is dead.  If that day comes so be it, the majority have spoken.  Until then, pot is illegal.  You may choose to break the law but i will have no pitty for you if you get cought<br>
<br>
My main agrument is where do you draw the line.  Im not disputing the possable medical benifets of pot.<br>
<br>
And talking about &quot;victemless&quot; crimes, what about child porn and child prostitution?  In many countrys in SE asia both are fully leagle.  Its not going away, it already exsists.  If we legalize prostitution why is the line drawn at 18?  Why not 17 or 16?  After all, its their body and they can do what they want to with it.<br>
<br>
The lines are drawn in the sand now.  If one changes, we need to re-evaluate all the accepted behaviors and limits of what our society will accept.  I firmly beleave that if there was a required 100% of the populas vote on wether of not pot would be made illegal, it would stay illegal.<br>

<br>
Was wondering how long this would take to come up.<br>
<br>
This should be an addendum to Godwin's Law.<br>
<br>
Child porn exploits and abuses children, who don't truly understand what is going on. They don't have the capability of responsibly deciding if they should have sex or not. It happens at different ages for different people.. but up until 16-18 (normally) you just don't have the mental capacity to understand.<br>
<br>
The reason a lot of people don't see this, is that they consider children &quot;adults with small bodies&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, they aren't. Children don't think like adults.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
&quot;When the cats away, the mice will play.&quot;<br>
<br>
What does it mean?<br>
<br>
To me: When authority isn't focused on me, I may feel I can get away with things I couldn't otherwise get away with.<br>
<br>
To a child: When there isn't a cat around, mice can come out and play.<br>
<br>
You see how that works? Children don't possess the skill to think of things abstractly, or examine the consequences of their actions other then &quot;mommy will yell at me.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is the difference.<br>
<br>
Now kindly don't compare drug users to child molestors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujaymbear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jay m bear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/20/02 5:47:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1725.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Legalizing drugs/prostitution</span><hr size=1> Um... labor laws... duh.<br>

You legalize and regulate the industry, it falls under existing labor laws.<br>
<br>
You just don't let anyone under eighteen work in a government-regulated brothel.<br>
<br>
Will there be people under 18 working illegally as prostitutes?  Yes.  Just like there are illegal immigrants working in hotels, restaurants, etc., now, and sweatshops violating labor laws now.<br>
<br>
But if you legalize pot and legalize prostitution and provide them with regulation and taxation, you will *reduce* crime, not *increase* it.  People will drug problems will be able to go to rehab, not jail.  <br>

Remember Prohibition?  It didn't work so well, as you may recall. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/dreorg.jpg"><BR>

And the netherlands isnt all peachy after "legalizing" drugs, infact most drugs arent legal.  The just kind of ignore it.  And most people there dont use, they were just trying to be accomodating.  Even though they regulate the ages and amounts and types that can be sold, its still organized crime owning and supplying most of these places.<br>
<br>
So making it legal only takes the profits out of the hands of the poor kids who scrape a bit off the top, and put it all in the hands of the syndicates.<br>
<br>
The netherlands wont admit this publicly, but unofficially gov officials have said 90% of supply to coffee houses are controlled by organized crime.  Has the netherlands achieved success with thier legalization, yes they have.  They got what they wanted.  They still have a war on drugs there also, but since they arent arresting as many people they have elivated some strain on thier budget.  They have also boosted thier tourism, you know theres an assload of GI's hitting the red light district and a bunch of dope heads floating in just to say theyve been there.<br>
<br>
I also think its funny that people think the x generation will just come in and fix the world.  The x gen just likes to bitch, they dont care about nothin but themselves.  Thier we fight for you is a self indulgant superiority complex.  The legalizing drugs when they come to power thing, pshaw.  Someone doesnt get how politics works, you could have a huge user voter pool and still not get legal.  Only way your gonna access that entire pool is to campaign on just drugs, and I would wager most people dont vote on drugs.   I doubt that all x'ers will be pro drug when they come into force, most will have realized by then how drugs slowed them down.  Wether just monetarily or advancement potential(not saying that you cant be brilliant and be on dope, just saying lots of dope heads ruin thier lives on the stuff.  Ive seen it happen).<br>

Legalizing harder drugs, no way.  Legalizing hookers?  Hell no.<br>
<br>
It seems like there's quite a few beneficial aspects to marijuana, with mood/state altering affects also associated with it, so I can see it being legalized so long as it's kept to private use, and made illegal to get beefed up and go out on the town.  Really, marijuana's closest comparison seems to be beer, causes slowed reflexes/stimuli, can dull the senses, causes an altered state, etc.  If we are really going to allow beer, there's no reason we should disallow marijuana, as light a drug as it is.  Honestly, I feel pretty confident if alcohol didn't have such a long history of being legal, we would try and illegalize it as well(or further regulate it)...but marijuana doesn't share the same history in legality, thus it receives less support for the issue of legality in this regard.<br>
<br>
As for the stuff besides marijuana, keep it illegal.  These drugs are seriously dangerous, can hurt you(and others through you) physically as well as emotionally, in numerous ways.  If people lived in a vacuum, that might be all right, since it's their life, their choice...but we don't.  If you take drugs and end up ruining your body, or needing medical work, or hurting someone else, we all end up being responsible and paying to take care of you, and your problem, because you are a member of our society.  What you do to yourself inevitably ends up affecting us all one way or another.  For example, you end up drinking away an organ, you end up needing a donor organ that someone else who had no choice in the matter needs, thus they suffer for your recreational choice.  Course, it's for these reasons that I'd like to see cigarettes illegal, and alcohol further regulated or done away with, but that's a bit beyond the topic.<br>
<br>
As for prostitution, sex simply should not be something equated with a dollar sign.  If you really think intimate interaction between two human beings should just be a matter of shelling out a few clams to some chick who leans on your car, then all I can say is that I certainly don't envy you.  But you want to put a governmental stamp of approval onto it, and you're gonna encounter stiff opposition from quite a few people, myself included.<br>

You legalize all drugs, and &quot;carefully regulate&quot; them as you say?  People will want to buy them, but think many of these regulations are BS, and would end up going to drug dealers to not have to put up with it.  Or look at the current market for legal prescription drugs, the prices are usually outrageous...drug dealers could significantly cut their profit margin, and probably come to a semi-competitive rate with some of the legally sold stuff, and still make a good profit.  And then what would you have to charge drug dealers with?  Certainly not sales of an illegal narcotic...you'd have to hit them with selling legal narcotics without a permit, they'd be doing the same thing they always did, just now they'd be short-cutting big-business of the US drug cartel, rather than trafficking of an illegal substance.  And they'd probably have drug cartels hustling to develop new products that provide a harder kick, what is the US gonna do, let cartels develop new ones, and then just immediately produce/sell whatever they put out, regardless of the effects?  Do you realize how utterly inane that prospect is?  Want to keep it illegal for kids under 18, then drug dealers have a market in them just as always.

It's nothing so grand as some &quot;we'll say we don't want drugs so we can profit off of it.&quot;  It's a not having the balls to take the tough stance on drugs, and do what we know would have to be done to get rid of it, because doing so would piss off too many people.  But they know something has to be done, even if it's not enough.  Unfortunately, most of the drugs are grown in other countries, so we have to piss off these bitchy liberal Europeans and all these other moaning nations of the world by going to these countries and getting the head honchos where they are based, if we want to stop the problem.

She tried to tell me that the government making something legal or illegal had no psychological effect/impact on citizens.  I promptly provided a link(I wish I still had it, deleted it about a month ago when I was cleaning out saved bookmarks) to a study on Poland, where abortion had moved from legal to illegal.  Within just the first year of becoming illegal, the statistics for abortions had dropped down insanely(and no, that wasn't discounting statistics for illegal abortions)...course, Poland is an entirely different society, but it still goes towards the point that legality affects psychologically.  I think I also checked the numbers for Ireland back then, where abortion was illegal, and the numbers for performed abortions were far below those of other nations.  The question of legality does, in fact, for quite a lot of people(after all, what is 100% in this world?) make an impact on perception of the issue, both in regards to crime and punishment, as well as perception of general morality of the issue.  Government legalizes something, it's like putting a societal stamp of approval on it, and you will indeed get many more people using drugs by doing so, just because people would think, wow, if the government says it's ok, it can't be all that bad after all.<br>

 I believe to really reason through this, we have to let go of some of our moral codes. We must realize that our moral code isn't absolute, and we can't expect people to live by it. Some things, such as murder, rape, theft, etc, are things that step on others. IE, to do those things would be to take away the rights of another person. Drugs and prostitution however, do not. If I go and smoke some weed in my bedroom, what is it to anyone else? <br>

Child porn exploits and abuses children, who don't truly understand what is going on. They don't have the capability of responsibly deciding if they should have sex or not.

I'm sure there's quite a few adults and children who don't subscribe to your latter statement that children don't have the capability to decide responsibly many issues for themselves. If they want to have sex, or go smoke a cigarette, you telling them that they aren't old and sensible enough, isn't that just imposing -your- moral codes upon them?

This is why age limits are imposed. They aren't absolute. There isn't some magical change at age 18 that says you now understand what is going on.

<br>
Drug prices are currently so high because addicts have no problems paying an increasing amount of money to get their high. When a drug dealer first confronts you, they will often offer some of their product for free. They will liekly cut you a deal, offering the next bit for a smaller amount of money then their normal rate. After a time, they will offer you their normal rate, then a marked increase.<br>
<br>
This is where the majority of the inflation comes from. The big drug cartels in columbia don't account for the majority of the drug use in the US. Pot (number 1 drug, by .. well, by far) is almost always grown locally, or shipped from canada.<br>
<br>
If the government stricly regulated and sold it, they could not only make a substantial profit (national debt gone in 10 years, every child could go to college, this is a rough estimate of the money to be had), they could choke out all the smaller dealers. Americans <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> gravitate towards the best deal. If the government provides the best deal, guess who is going to get the most business.<br>
<br>
You are never going to completely get rid of street dealers offering the &quot;new high&quot;, but you can certainly destroy the majority of them. That is why I want drugs legalized. People are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> going</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to use drugs regardless of what legislation is passed, and regardless of the countless billions of dollars spent on ridding our country of it so far. Legalize it, regulate it, and a lot of the nasty side effects that come with drugs will disappear. <br>
<br>
Do you understand that purity is a big deal? You will likely not die from drugs alone. You die/get fucked up, because of things in the drugs that shouldn't be there. If you can get perfect pot forever, why go to something stronger? I can make alcohol. I make beer often. I like amber honey beer. I can, through several techniques, make alcohol that completely fucks you up. I can make it stronger then ANYTHING sold on the market. Could I ever get a market going for this? No. Why get something of dubious origins when you can get something pure from the government?<br>

 It comes down to the idea that it's okay to abrogate freedom, if the freedom in question is one you don't like. Too many times, people will use slippery slope analogies to further their own points. Ie, 10 people in a thousand using pot now will turn into 999 in a 1000 people using drugs should they be legalized. Not only do these arguments look silly on paper, they play out the opposite way in real life.<br>

Heh, I believe Estopidiera made the same argument on the topic of legalized/illegalized abortion quite a while ago. She tried to tell me that the government making something legal or illegal had no psychological effect/impact on citizens. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I don't agree with Estopidiera if she indeed thinks this.<br>

Abortion isn't drug use. They don't even fall under the same psychological umbrella. They are different complusions entirely.<br>

Wow, way to jump to conclusions.<br>

Maybe most people are sensible and would rather have their child, and then give it up for adoption, then go to a back alley abortion clinic? <br>

This situation has nothing to do with drugs. Abortion and Drugs have nothing in common. Abortion is a sad thing to do. If I were a woman, I wouldn't do it.. ever. But, I am pro-choice all the way. <br>
<br>
Anyway, drugs are illegal in the US, and our drug-use rate isn't significantly lower then a lot of places in the world.<br>
<br>
This by itself is ample evidence to completely dismiss the analogy you are trying to make here.<br>

 What she meant, is that the best way to control many problems, is to stop punishing people for doing them, and simply expose the fact that they ARE doing it. It's tempting to quickly lift up the jar lid, steal a treat, and walk away. But, if that jar is wide open, the temptation decreases. If you take, everyone is going to know. <br>

Unfortunately, psychology like that works on some people, but not others...people are different. Some people this works on, other people you have to punish them to get them to stop, some people nothing works on changing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There'd be a lot who still wouldn't. For many, prostitution is just a means of self-destructive behavior, for others it's desperation, sometimes it's just all some people know. Most prostitutes would probably see all these regulations and rules as just another pimp, just with the government pimping them instead, he might not hit them, but he'd certainly abuse them by telling them what they can and can not do, while taking his piece of their action and making his sweet bucks off of their ass-slappin'.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nobody is denying that some prostitutes do so for extremely unhealthy reasons.<br>
<br>
This is not an argument about them though. This is a discussion about the act in and of itself. Are you telling me the whores on the mustang ranch are self destructive? Likely not, they are clean, disease free women who make a lot of money performing sexual acts on people.<br>
<br>
I don't see anything wrong with this.<br>
<br>
There is no possible way this can hurt society.<br>
<br>
But, you find it distasteful, therefore it should be illegal.<br>
<br>
Respond to this as you will Zistin, because I understand that you must have the last word to feel valid. But, your arguments are inane, drawn from personal morality and religious views, and are incredibly oppressive.<br>

Hard drugs should be illegal why? Look at what it does to the human body thru <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> use. People can die from 1 &quot;hit&quot; of crack.<br>

There is more to sex then just the motion of your body. This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> an opinion.<br>

My opinion would be those who have sex only for the pleasure on it really need to grow up.<br>
