Wow.<br>
<br>
 First, don't blame the Arabs because your employer found you to be expendable. The problem is yours or theirs. I don't know the situation, and frankly don't care. You’re a racist and you chose to show a horrible side of yourself in public. Yes, I have prejudices, but I keep them to myself and base my own decisions off of them. That part of this thread is well over and done though I believe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Castingfool- Like so many others during times like we find ourselves in now is definitely showing his version of history. To bad, as so many others have pointed out, it is utter bullshit revisionism. The sad part is there could have been a point there. Try this: The American culture has developed over the years, and perhaps as that development slows down we should take a look to see where we currently stand. I do believe we should have English as our official language just to make things easier, however nobody should be deported or fined or punished for not speaking it. I just think all public funded schools should teach that as primary. I know most do, but have heard of some that do not. This creates a separate America. I do not think culture is lost through a change in language. The rest of his WASP drivel was pointless and best ignored.<br>
<br>
Wagner71- I am a liberal. (Non-democrat) I don't blame the republicans so much as I blame the idiots who eat the shit they serve. I will however breathe a sigh of relief when our current immoral, coke headed, alcoholic, thieving, racketeering leader is out of office. If morality were the only issue and you voted republican you are simply a sheep. Baaah! Baah! Bill Clinton wants sex, which is way worse than Bob Dole being the last person to vote for the civil rights amendment, while serving in Congress early in his career. Baah! Baah1 Get rid of that joint smoking Clinton, give me the born-again alcoholic GW. <br>
<br>
Republican morality is a myth like people posting on message boards having a life. (doh!)<br>
<br>
<br>
Xastlin Gloveburner-Yup you’re Indian. You got screwed. So on behalf of male white America, and listen up decedents of Africans, Asians, women and every other minority cause I am only gonna say it once more, sorry.<br>
<br>
Sorry we took your shit, fucked your ancestors and lied to you. There are no forty acres and a mule for you, and we lied about improving the places we've delegated for you to live. We have, however, come to our senses on a few things. You can come and live amongst us now. There are drawbacks, however, the average one amongst us thinks Leave it to Beaver is history, and the Andy Griffith Show is how the old south was. On a side note, we are gonna start taxing the Indian Casinos because we just realized that really isn't a part of your culture and the 1/4 Indian guy running it has never seen an arrowhead in his life. Oh yeah, and no more killing endangered species. I don't care if killing whales is an Eskimo tradition, killing little brown people is a white man's tradition and we got over it. Ooops sorry, got off track. <br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, as for the economic arguments, Clinton is not the cause of the current recession, nor are the terrorists. Once upon a time it may have taken a while for policies to affect the economic world, but the world has sped up greatly. Clinton was actually able to maintain consumer confidence throughout his administration, despite the many close encounters he had with the market dropping out from under us. Bush could not. Yes, the growth rate was slowing down, but it was still a GROWTH. Growth stopped and recession began about March is the estimate, a few months before the terrorists attacks. Bush's policies once they were fully anounced sent ripples throughout the world. When he started backing out of long standing treaties with other countries, foreign investors balked. Say what you will about our independence, but that foreign cash goes a long way. We need other countries, and I don't think it is un-American to admit that.  Our total mishandling of the Chinese during the downed spy plane ordeal is another example of poor foreign policy souring overseas countries to America. <br>
    <br>
I do believe terrorism hurt the economy. That it did is a given, but it didn't drive it into the cellar, it just dimmed the lights down there. Actually following disaster and during war economic growth usually occurs. Multitudes of jobs are created during wars. The government has an excuse to feed the bloated military-industrial complex and we don't protest, because we believe we need 200,000 dollar missiles by the crate load to level clay houses and 70s model Toyota trucks which may have a strategic use against us. They are already talking of attacking Iraq. Why? Not enough money chucked into the sand in Afghanistan. Unfortunately America, unlike Switzerland and Japan, hasn't learnt that a strong military does not equal a strong economy. <br>
<br>
I do also believe another strain on the economy has been the anthrax attacks, which are believed to be domestic. I have yet to see anyone use any slurs against whichever deranged anti-social scum is behind this. I have asked before, without an answer, but as this post is more active I'll ask here.<br>
If we find this person holed up in the woods in Montana can we declare war on them, and blow up all the Montana shacks?We get about as much terrorism from Montana shack-dwellers as we do from overseas.<br>
<br>
Ah well maybe patch is done. <br>
Peace to you all and good luck on survival in an ever-growing confusion.<br>

Do you seriously believe that this is the only country in the world where one can voice one's opinions freely?
