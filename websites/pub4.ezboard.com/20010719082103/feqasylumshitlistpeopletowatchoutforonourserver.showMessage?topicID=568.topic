I met him as Nomaru and he was pretty nice at the time, polite, if not a little bizarre at times even by my standards. <br>
<br>
Over time his odd but decent attitude seemed to deteriorate. For a long time i refused to believe other people when they told me he was a few fries short of a happy meal, since he was nice enough and helpful when he could be. <br>
<br>
He was one of the first people in my guild, and i think this is one thing most of my guild members regret the most. He was not let back into the guild after his third tantrum (ie- He would get upset over something, disguild, ask for a reinvite later.) and disguilding. After he talked to me about it we agreed with him that we would take a vote on it, and as far as i'm concerned.. when it comes to members... if anyone in the guild says no.. then no is no. I don't want conflicts in the guild. The fact is one of the officers of the guild voted no, others hesitated but said they were ok with giving him one more try. Because of this one vote I told him he would not be allowed to rejoin. He flipped, began to spam my members with questions, most of them angry questions. Demanding to know who had voted no. I told him i wouldn't tell him who because it was not something i had the right to tell anyone. So he threatens to harass every guild member until he finds out who it was and gets back into the guild. Ok, nutcase. I lay a temporary rule over the guild that everyone is to have his charcters on ignore until things simmered down. If they didn't have him on ignore it was their problem to deal with. <br>
<br>
Time goes by, things go pretty decently, and then boom he's back. He has this one favorite target of his in my guild whose name i will with hold (I was asked to do so). When she joined the guild she was pretty new to the game, and a friend of his. As i understand the story that was told to me, when she hit 20 and typed in that surname he sat back and typed in the same surname and claimed that they were now married and that was how it worked in game. She shrugged at it and thought ok fine, some RP wouldn't be half bad. This is just my understanding of the story and in my views i feel that was taking advantage of her (at the time) lack of knowledge of how the game worked. He's been obssessed with this poor girl since, even though she told him she was married IRL and happy. He claimed they spoke on the phone every day and that she told him she would leave her husband for him. Maybe i meddle too much but i didn't think that sounded quite right so i ask the girl and that seemed to be the straw that broke the camels back. He was fairly rude to her friends (of the male persuasion) and husband (who also plays). She had been getting more and more annoyed with the way he clung to her in game and obssessed with her every moment she was logged in. He gave her gifts when she had first started the game and when she finally told him to leave her alone he demanded these gifts be returned. So of course the arguement begins, but he's not polite over it. He swears at her, demands that she drop whatever it is she is doing and meet him at XXX bank immediatley to return HIS items or he would report her, have her banned, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  hack her account and get them back himself</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->... she asked me what she could do, if she could really be banned for this etc etc etc... All i could say to her was 'report him, report him now. If he's threatening you, your account or anything else it needs to be reported, it's serious.' and so the /ignore rule came back into effect for the guild. This person makes a new character and he somehow finds out who her NEW character is, all the while i do believe he harassed her husband during the time he didn't know who she was. <br>
<br>
Tonight, yet again... i am getting complaints from my guild members. I was not as nice dealing with him this time as i was before, i admit. I was straight to the point, as i am tired of dealing with this character. This girl's sister started to play the game and joined the guild recently, and so he's got his new target it seems. It bothers me that he harasses people from my guild, and i thought for a good month on whether this was shit listable or not, after tonight i feel it is. I cut and paste all the screenshots of the conversation about this. Some are his tells to me, others are guildchat. I missed a lot of the earlier guild chat from zoning, so there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> some missing from the screenshots, though it was basically the girl's sister being upset and asking the guild what to do from what i was told. <br>
(the names that are blurred out are the sisters involved in the whole ordeal. I have them blurred for a reason. Talk to me in game if you have some issue with this)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/conv3.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->(switch the first two around, i pasted them wrong and was too tired to put them back around once i had flattened the image. In either case, the second chat image on there should be the first and vice versa)<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  image 2</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/conv2.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Generally, he has this girl very nervous, she is worried he's in the guild with another character (Which was one of his threats before, to sneak into the guild, but i give him credit enough to think he isn't that pathetic). Also the bottom tells are him lying. His story clashes with the one my member tells me, and i can vouch for her absense as she claims it. She has been offline or at least not on any known characters for a while now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  image 3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/conv1.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> Just random remarks made in guildchat that i thought might pass along the message that this guy is relentless <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   He doesn't talk to me, he knows i'd much sooner see him just quit (like he always says he will) than listen to him anymore. but the fact remains he does bother guild members of mine, these ones especially... others on occasion though their names will also remain unannounced as i know he likes to find ways to attack at these ones as well...<br>
<br>
That's all, i just really feel like this is a crime. People talk about KSing, people Sh-list for stealing... IMO this is the worst. Spending energy harassing people. <br>
<br>
<br>
edit: Oh i also forgot to add that he successfully chased someone from the guild and i have honestly not seen her even return in game since. Again, he was obssessing over her like he had done to these others recently and harassing her. Trying to get RL info, phone numbers etc etc...<br>

Certainly!  That's why they go around making idle threats, harassing people, and stalking, right?  /boggle<br>

I have to agree with Xianle that this should definitely be here.  Psychologically tormenting people is much more harmful than your standard KS, at least IMO.  <br>

Just continue to report. Note the time/date/character name of each report and follow up with Frizz. If Frizznik isn't on, petition daily until you DO talk to him. That way you can be sure he will personally view your report logs.<br>

I'd imagine if a few people reported this behavior, and it was clear that his attention was clearly stated as unwanted and he persisted and made other characters with the intent to harass...well he's looking at a perma-ban. <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

I watched this guy delevel himself at the Qeynos guards from 56 all the way to 20. I complained about him leaving 50-something corpses lying around. He pretty much told me to fuck off.<br>
<br>
/petition<br>
<br>
And I told him I had. Guess what? Cleaned his shit up real quick after that.<br>
<br>
He told me he wanted to be able to adventure with his in-game girlfriend, but didn't want to stop playing his character. Why should I? he said, I've got all my skills maxxed!<br>
<br>
Hee hee...I love the fact that Verant nerfed delevelers RIGHT after he did that. He was bein' a pissant prick. I couldn't stand him before, and I downright detest him after reading this.<br>

Honestly, I've talked to Nomaru before, and he seemed alright, although that was a long time ago. I remember the name Inspiration as well, though I had no idea it belonged to Nomaru. Inspiration tried to get into GoD shortly before he joined Nyaa, though I don't know if that was just this character and Nomaru was already guilded with you. My first encounter with him has to be the strangest tell I've ever recieved from any prospective guild member...even if he made it out to be roleplaying. We did not expect to let him join as his character Inspiration was extremely twinked and being powerleveled, two things we have loose rules about in GoD. <br>
<br>
My only complaint about him would have to be that for the three or so days he was looking into our guild, he sent tells to me from the moment either I or he got on until one of us got off...kind of irritating and a hassle when I was usually in a fight or dealing with three or four other people in tells. My last real tell from him was an out of the blue &quot;Well I guess I'll go join another guild&quot;, after which he wouldn't respond when I asked him if he had sent some sort of a finalizing tell that I had missed in everything else.<br>
<br>
*shrugs* He did strike me as an odd guy, though I'm afraid I can't confirm or deny anything else about the accusations. <p><center><img src="http://guardiansofdawn.homestead.com/files/sigjeanfin.jpg">

I was on my old primary then, I was lvl 16 or 17, and looking for an SSB (Skull-Shaped Barbutte) for my friend. I've seen these things auctioned before for about 120-200pp. So, I see Inspiration selling a SSB, and I ask him how much. He tells me 350pp. I say hmm, that sounds a tad expensive, don't they usuall go for like 120-200pp. He responds by saying &quot;Don't fuck with me, and don't tell me prices for items you fuckin noob. I'm more than 3 times ur lvl, and I can kick ur ass. Don't try to bullshit me or rip me off.&quot; <br>
<br>
(note; this happend like a month ago; I don't remember the EXACT words he used; but I remember his words were almost identical to what I said&quot;.<br>
<br>
My actions ain't enough to SL him, or even petition or anything. But still, if someone else posts, I'll add my experiences. <br>

<br>
Vindication is in my current guild and he hasn't harrassed anybody since he has been with us as far as I know. He has been with us for about a month. He is always very helpful and tries to assist all members whenever possible. Now if Vindication was doing this I wasn't sent any tells about it.<br>
<br>
I don't remember the shit list rules per say. But I guess I will ask him about it now after the fact.<br>
<br>
If you all need anything let me know. You all have known him longer than me.<br>
<br>
Can someone please email me the exact details, <br>

I've known Nom in game for quite a while now. He was in and out of the guild I was then a member of several times. Back when I first met him, he seemed to be a really great guy. He was very generous and fun to be around. Then some sort of RL relationship issues came up, and he hasn't been the same since. He went down hill emotionally from there, (as did our friendship) He was extremely depressed/suicidal.<br>
<br>
Although I haven't had much contact with him lately, in previous months he seemed to develop some sort of attachment to me, and to another female friend of mine. I know it made us both extremely uncomfortable. So much so that she avoided EQ almost totally for a couple weeks. While I don't think that what he said to either of us could quite qualify as stalking, or harrassment, it was nonetheless a little too &quot;familiar&quot; for me. Enough to make me avoid him like the plague.<br>
<br>
In my honest opinion, I think that Nom may be manic depressive IRL, which would explain the EXTREME mood changes he has, as well as some of the attatchment issues. I really wish that he would get some help, because somewhere down there is the nice kid that I liked so much when I first met him. And while I do think that there are some psychological issues there, I in no way intend to condone his actions or try to explain them away. If his behaviour has gotten this bad, he has no excuse, something really needs to be done about it. Perhaps he will do something extreme enough to get his account yanked. In a way I hope so, because I think he's using EQ as an escape for his real life issues that he so desperately needs to address.<br>
<br>
I'm just sorry that he doesn't care enough about himself or anyone else to do it.<br>
<br>
With much respect,<br>

I have only seen him in EC one day and he was talking about how he was married and argueing that his wife wanted to get something to eat and it was like 3am in the morning. So he was just sitting there like wtf can you go this late at night and stuff. Oh well didnt seem to harmless to me but then again i have not talked with him nor has he to me. Inspiration sounds like the pally, Vindaction was the char i saw, some iksar i think, and namarou or whatever sounds like some dude that was in IS and i want to say druid /shrug... <p>-Hakuna Matata-
