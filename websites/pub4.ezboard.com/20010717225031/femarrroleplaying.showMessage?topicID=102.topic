She sang to the trees and whistled to the birds, ever falling short of the warrior skills her father would have had her master and caring little for Tunare her mother's sovereign.<br>
<br>
<br>
She fumbled with sword and dagger finding herself little better in the ways of combat than her mother, but she had her father's warrior heart and a courage unsurpassed even by the mighty elven warrior himself. This troubled both of her parents as she grew more and more bold while advancing little in the ways of a warrior.<br>
<br>
<br>
Her mother, knowing her heart would never be that of Tunare's, and fearing for her daughter's well being, sent her to the warriors Guild. There she was taught the ways of the Warlord. She studied his creed, and admired the strength of spirit and power of body of those warriors in his grace. (Not to mention those brood chests and the rippling muscles displayed so proudly on the Males. Even the gnome warriors were undeniable handsome)<br>
<br>
<br>
She'd have stayed there forever on those practice grounds, but her strength and skills were found lacking. She was sent on her way with best of wishes, even as the Guild master knew she would likely be slain early in life if she did not find her true calling- what ever that may be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Marlos hurt. Not the pains she had felt on the practice fields, but something much deeper. Her tears would not be held any longer. She held close her most loyal companions, the trees of her home and of her child hood. And she cried, deep and mournfully until her heart of hearts carried those tears on mournful notes to all the trees of the forest. She cried and sang her woes to the trees so that even they felt her pains and quivered with sorrow... Finally sleep found her and her tears had seeped to the roots of her audience.<br>
<br>
<br>
She awoke with a start to find a Human, or perhaps not as his ears suggested a more elven line, smiling at her. Fear took hold of her heart as she had heard of such humans coming upon unsuspecting maidens. Her heart took her fear in true warrior fashion her short sword was at her defense between herself and this travel hardened male.<br>
<br>
<br>
He laughed. He smiled at her. Not too handsome a smile, but not completely hideous... She opened her mouth to banish this trespasser on her privacy and found herself with out words as he began to sing. And he sang. He sang of joy. He sang of sadness. He sang of war and he sang of peace. She was awe struck and said nothing even as he gave her a note to give to the bardic guild master. And then he was gone... And then she sang to Rallos Zek, and her voice carried her spirit to the Song Weavers' Guild.<br>

Her eyes revealing her excitement over having a bard at her disposal even as her massive form reclined passively just away from the fire's great warmth.<br>
<br>
&quot;My liege, as you wish.&quot; Marlos Battleborne had only recently been inducted to the Vanguard of the Iron Crown, and still felt uneasy near such powerful creatures as this barbarian shamaness'. She wrapped her extra cloak close around her as she moved as close to the fire as the flames would allow. Her hair frizzling in wafts of heat even as her body convulsed with a new bout of shivers.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a story... One of those creatures who some up here still doubt truly exist... A warrior even dears... It was huge, even larger than you my friends, with green skin and green blood and a stench that carries farther than believable and seems to never wash off. A Troll.&quot; Marlos smiled, as she knew this would hold even the mighty warrior's attentions. &quot;I was hunting in South Ro, past were the desert ends... There are orcs in that place too, though much less worthy foes than these... I was with out allies in those days and dodging the sight of the trolls and ogres the oft times roam those lands, but this one troll caught my eye. <br>
<br>
&quot;As I said, he is a warrior, and seemed my equal in standing though for certain far greater in power than I. He walked boldly into a camp of three of those green orcs. Now, as I saw it, they all seemed to be an easy battle even for me so long as there was only one, but this warrior walked into three. And the three orcs had at him. I feared for the warrior, and then for myself if the troll did run. I watched him closely as he battled. An orc fell to his blades, but he was far from healthy, as over half of his blood lay spilt across the green grass. <br>
<br>
&quot;The berserker fury took hold of him as he turned to his second orc. Having one orc on his back and one facing his blades the troll's blood spread across the battlefield. He was certain to drop in a blow or two when he turned to his final opponent. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh did I wish at this moment that I had the gift of healing with the blessing of my Gawd, for he was a brave warrior and did not deserve this fate... I heard his bellowed and frenzied pray to Rallos Zek, and knowing we shared a common Gawd offered my prays for this troll warrior as well. &quot;Rallos Zek is not a meek gawd though. He demands that his minions be strong and makes them the strongest through trial. Our prayers were heard and answered when a passing orc did join his fellow in the final slaying of this troll... <br>
<br>
&quot;'RUN' I cried to him, knowing that no warrior with a heart of the Warlord would. His fate was sealed as he laid his blades upon the third orc from the camp and felt the wrath of the wondering orc as well. Any blow now meant his end. Ever blow he laid was a boasting right and a true gift from Rallos Zek himself. I watched this brave warrior's health closely. &quot;And the third orc fell... The troll turned his snarling face, covered head to toe in his own blood, and so near death that he was far from sane. His eyes did not see me, but only that orc still laying glancing blows upon his flesh. His bellowed war cry was one word, 'Zek'&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos adjusted her cloak wishing she could climb into the fire as the cold still leached heat from her. She bent down to get some mulled brandy from the kettle she had propped on her spit. She needed the warmth inside her, and hopefully the brandy would ease her shakes. <br>
<br>
&quot;What happened!?!&quot; from the dark edge of the camp a grizzled veteran ranger shown eager eyes as he anxiously rubbed down his treant wood bow. <br>
<br>
Raising her eyes to the ranger, &quot;I'm sorry, what?&quot; Marlos appeared flustered and confused. She knew that she was thought of as frivolous and often laughed at as she froze, but now she had these on the edge of their seats and she was not going to let them off easily. &quot;Oh, yes. Umm, I was telling a story... Which was um..?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The troll! Orcs everywhere!&quot; Gargantua had seemed amused by Marlos' story, but was now nearly in tears as she held her laughter from her face. But the ranger did seem about to burst, as he gripped his bow stave and tried to retell the story by waving it about him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot; Marlos chirp, &quot;that one, yes of course.&quot; Marlos settled herself back down with her warm brandy and made eye contact with every member of their war party. &quot;The troll had survived the third orc of the camp, but if that wasn't unbelievable enough, he had that fourth orc having at him. He was in no condition to even stand, but he was insane with battle rage. He turned to the fourth orc and swung his blades at him. It was as though Rallos Zek had made him untouchable, but he was being touched. I watched that troll, and I could tell he was as dead as one can be and still have their breath in them. Rallos Zek had answered our prayers, but not like those weak gawds, but as in the fashion of a true Warlord among the gawds. He proved the value of his warriors and the power of his creed and the strength of the blessings he bestowed upon the warrior hearted... The troll warrior prevailed not from unlikely odds, but from impossible ones. <br>
<br>
&quot;I made my presence known to the warrior when he slew his final orc. As much as I dislike trolls and find no joy in their stench, I had a duty to do as a vassal of Rallos Zek. I offered my guardianship while he rested and tended his wounds. When he was of a fashion that could protect himself, I fled his presence to the trees. <br>
<br>
&quot;After all, duty is one thing, but a troll is still a troll.&quot; Marlos finished her story with her finger raised and every eye on her and every attention hers to direct. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bah!&quot; the old grizzled ranger stood quickly turning from the fire to seek a place a little less social mumbling in his wake about fanciful bard stories and foolishness in the elvish kind. <br>
<br>
But Marlos knew... Marlos knew the truth of her stories, and she knew the power her telling held. That ranger would never stand to challenge a troll warrior with out ample alliance to defeat it. And Marlos knew that in her telling, Rallos Zek had found praise and a bit more honor amongst the creatures of Norrath. <br>
<br>
As conversions and laughter found themselves dispersed by sleep, Marlos thought she heard a pray lifted from a warrior's lips to Zek... With a glad smile, she offered one of her own as sleep found her. <br>

Freja Honorsoul plead for aid in ridding her homeland of the horrid Redwind and his band of Icy orcs. Gargantua Stormcaller the iron clad shaman of Justice ordained her plea and the Vanguard of the Iron Crown set to place Redwind under siege. <br>
<br>
Marlos Battleborne, a slight and seemingly frail elven bard, took heed of the Vanguard's call to arms. This is her story: <br>
<br>
I was whistling to the birds in South Karana when I received the call. Being new to the Vanguard, I wasn't sure I'd be wanted on such an important campaign, but I spoke my heart and was bid welcome. <br>
<br>
The Journey to Everfrost peaks was long, but I was not disheartened by it. I beat out a marching song on my drum and journeyed with all due haste to the homeland of the barbarians... Mind you this trip was not with out incidence, as in West Karana I happened upon a misshapen half wolf half human. It struck at me, and pursued me with ill intention, but I'd not be turned from my appointed course. A Knight of the Realm had ordained my mission and it had little to do with slaying those slow beasts called Werewolves. <br>
<br>
I met with Freja Honorsoul just outside of Halas where she told me of the horrors beset her people. Being bound by honor to Halas then, I made ready with the necessary supplies (an extra set of long under garments) and followed her lead to Redwind's lair. <br>
<br>
I had been to Everfrost peaks before, and had remember that the weather was chill there, but on the open plains with the wind's fleeting mercy, my poor elven joints did ache dearly. I remember thinking how could any race bare such a climate as that. I can not remember a moment of actual warmth the whole of the time I was in the Northern land... Though I did stop shivering a bit with the aid of some blessed honey mead. <br>
<br>
When we reached Redwind's lair I was to first meet the mighty barbarian Shamaness, Knight of the Realm, she whom I had pledged to follow upon this crusade, Gargantua Stormcaller... Now don't let her name throw you, she is huge in stature and in power, but only gargantuan in heart. <br>
<br>
We set upon the siege, and did well for Gargantua had with her allies to make the siege. Even as allies came and went, our siege of Redwind's estate went unhindered and with out casualty... I entertained, as is my way, with a story of other barbarian companions I have known. In turn, we received a story from a ranger of his mighty quests. <br>
<br>
And what should happen next? Wulfhere, an ally and friend for many songs happened upon our battleground. Being a barbarian Warrior with a handsome smile, Gargantua did not yield a moment in welcoming him to our war party... Perhaps she saw more than a warrior in that physique, but that'd be her business and not mine to say... Wulfhere, as is his way, had Cryton, his trusted shaman and closest friend, not far behind him... And so our war party was a frozen wood elf Squire, two Knights of the Vanguard, and allies, which included two of my most faithful friends. <br>
<br>
But as the siege raged on, Freja suffered illness upon her home front, and finally had to take her healing to her family's aid. We sought out more allies, and found them plentiful, but too often short in duration before more pressing matters did take them away... Gargantua Commanded, and the siege did not waiver. For days we did slay icy orcs, and many brave allies and even I a small and frozen squire found advancement in our chosen paths. <br>
<br>
But fatigue grew in Gargantua's eyes. The battle had raged and the siege never waived, but still the days were long and tiresome. She wisely made her way from the siege to seek rest among her home, bidding me, &quot;Hold the orcs at bay as long as you can, and Good Luck.&quot; <br>
<br>
Such had never been dreamed of and though often feared. I was but a squire, but the Vanguard's Siege upon Redwind lay solely upon my frozen shoulders and my trust in my allies. <br>
<br>
So there we were, a ragged band of what was once solid war party. Myself only a bard of my 25th song, with my poor elven heart forcing near frozen blood through my numb limbs. Wulfhere a mighty Wolf of the North using his 26th sharpening stone to keep his blade ever razor ready. Cryton our interpreter of Justice as all shaman of the north are, holding the 25th honor from his people. And a slight and frail druid who was short of wit and not long of tongue. <br>
<br>
We held. <br>
<br>
Redwind came upon us with fury, and we held. <br>
<br>
Our hap-hazard druid did find need to move on how ever prophesying our demise... Wulfhere, of great warrior wisdom, did say, &quot;We may not see day again... &quot; But there way no fear in his eyes, only fact. We were three, and we might not hold. It was truth, and it was the life of a warrior to know these truths. <br>
<br>
An Icy orc emerged, and we did not waiver for our siege.... We held... Another, and we held... Many others, and we held... <br>
<br>
Then it was Redwind whose fury did come to us in force. After many weeks of siege from the Vanguard of the Iron Crown, left with but a squire of the Vanguard, and two allies in support, he was enraged... <br>
<br>
For those of you whom never heard barbarian legend, Redwind is a shadow knight of great power. He has slain more barbarians than any other orc in recorded time, and is a name used to frighten children of the north under their covers at night... He is fierce. Redwind came upon us... <br>
<br>
We held... <br>
<br>
His icy orcs, whom are all oracles in nature, stormed us one after another, and we held... <br>
<br>
We held for days. Every battle a bare victory with our ragged band of three, but we held and did not forsake the siege... <br>
<br>
Not once did Cryton have even half of his magic in him.. <br>
<br>
…but we held. <br>
<br>
Not once did Wulfhere know complete health… <br>
<br>
…but we held. <br>
<br>
It was not Redwind that finally broke the Vanguard's Holy siege upon him, but sheer mental fatigue of my allies... I bid them to rest and to find peace in it, as each of us made our own private oaths to return one day and finish Redwind and his Dragonic Lord and Lady <br>

Bard of Rallos Zek

She'd been long out of her woodland home and to her misfortune, she had found she preferred the comforts and bustle of a large city. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes dear, I am a part of the Vanguard. All be it, a small part. I am a Squire to the ninth circle and most recently I was in the service of Sir Yorie, Knight of the Realm.&quot; Marlos held the pride in her voice even as she sought only the sweat Honey Mead she had come for. <br>
<br>
&quot;A real knight! Truly a real knight!&quot; The youngster's eager presence was wearing on Marlos, but she had a soft spot for such enthusiasm. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes dear, a real knight. He is in fact the Knight of the Realm amongst the Vanguard's ninth circle&quot; Marlos' eyes returned the depth of importance that title held. &quot;He was part of a siege on Mistmoore Castle, and I was there with him to serve.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos had found little pleasure in this service though. It wasn't anyone's fault but her own, for it was her lot in life. But needless to say she had ironed enough robes and polished enough wands to suit her for a long while. Yorie, being a wizard, was not taken to the great swords and shiny plate that some of Marlos' other liege lords. So while the great hero's of the Vanguard stormed the castle, she set up in the courtyard which to suit the vampyre's needs was truly a graveyard. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, you are the squire to a Knight of the Realm.&quot; A light glimmered in the young elf's eyes. &quot;And you've been to Mistmoore and lived to speak of it. What's it like? Did you see a vampyre?&quot; <br>
<br>
This elf was not going away as Marlos had hoped, but if it was a story he wanted, then that's what he'd get. &quot;So you want to hear of Mistmoore...&quot; a darkness fell over Marlos' voice. &quot;Get me a Honey Mead and I'll share with you a tale of woe.&quot; The drink was ordered and the tale began. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Vanguard set upon Mistmoore in force, calling forward their allied forces of the Sisters without Mercy and the Nomadic Brotherhood. It was the greatest fighting force I had ever witnessed. We had what we thought was the power to put an end to the Mayong's evil existence. We were brave, and we were powerful, and we were wrong.&quot; The young elf's face went white as he felt the horror of such a realization. &quot;We set up war parties and set to making our presence known to Mistmoore. We slew the familiars as we came upon them, but not with out our own loses. The most powerful of our forces did not find and slay these, as they sought access to the castle proper. So it was left to the young knights and squires to deal with them. Many squires died. I myself awakened more than once to the administering of a cleric for the Sisters Without Mercy.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos took a deep draught of her Honey Mead as she gathered her strength to face the memory, which she buried deep in alcohol. &quot;My Liege Yorie lead my fellow squires and I as far in as he dared. Squire Rizzo made a valiant effort to hold our flanks using his keen druidic senses to search out the dangers, which surrounded us. Squire Annzabeth cared for our wounded, which took nearly every moment of her time. I feared she would lapse under the constant flow of wounded, but she did better any other could have. And me?.. I spent most of my time scared of my own shadow and hoping the sun would never set.&quot; What could she say? She had done nothing but fear for her life, and the laundry while other did the important tasks. <br>
<br>
&quot;My Liege did release me from duty early, as I had not the strength of spirit to continue,&quot; That admission bought tears to Marlos' eyes. She was a bard of Rallos Zek and she had failed to hold her spirit. &quot;So I made my way back to the safety of Lesser Faydark under a musical mist. &quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Along the path I found an old friend, Squire Kylik. He was separated from his Liege, and desperate to get back. I saw him, but he did not see me, as my mist hid me from sight. I called out to him, and played my song with fervor to envelop him in it's mist. 'I shall get you there safely dear friend' I told him. Not willing to tell him why I was not with my own Liege. <br>
<br>
&quot;His liege was penetrating the castle walls, but I had given my word to get him there so I took him past the Ghoulish Ancille to the foyer of the concert hall. All was not well. The bodies of great knights, some I had known and some I had only heard of lay dead on the floor. My blood flowed like ice in my heart, but Kylik's liege was not among the dead. We checked the bodies all the while with the horrible gargoyle staring down at us and the teir'dal searching for signs of life that they might extinguish. I told Kylik to those things he's liege would bid him to bring and for us to make haste to the safety of Faydark. <br>
<br>
&quot;We made our way out back past the cemetery where my Liege had his post, but it was empty. They had been fallen upon and forced to flee. Kylik made move to arm himself for the defense of Vanguard's honor, as he is a warrior and that is their way, but in his haste, he revealed our position. 'Run' I commanded as I let the mist drop and chanted out a marching song. 'To Faydark or to Death' there wasn't time to be afraid. I pulled the Teir'dal to me and gave my fellow a count to distance himself. I was off on barely close enough to my friend to make his run a march and seeking the attention of any teir'dal along the way. <br>
<br>
&quot;Along the way I made note of a body. Many bodies lay within the boundaries of the Mayong's rule, but this one caught my eye. It was Annzabeth, my dear friend and an elf to whom I owe my life many times over. She did not deserve death, but there she lay as I ran by. <br>
<br>
&quot;Safe in Faydark we found Kylik's liege, and I bid him safety. I had to go back. Annzabeth was in there. I played a mist and went back past they very teir'dal that chased my to the edge of their master's land. To Annzabeth's side.&quot; Tears streamed down Marlos' face, but she couldn't notice. Her eyes were glazed with sorrow and Honey Mead and as the young elf looked on, he cried as well for her pain. &quot;Annzabeth, dear friend, I was not there to save you. She was dead, young one.&quot; Marlos' eye flooded her face as she looked upon the face of innocence. <br>
<br>
&quot;Rizzo came to collect her body. He said there was a cleric that may still be able to bring her back, but the pain in his eyes was too evident for me to believe there was not more than friendship in them. He was scared. For the first time in Mistmoore I saw him scared. Not for his own well being, but that he might have lost more than his life. He was scared that he mat have lost Annzabeth, and so was I.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos pushed her mead away from her. She'd had enough of that tonight. She had had enough of that. &quot;I went as deep into Mistmoore as I could trying to bring out the bodies of the dead. So many dead.&quot; Marlos drew herself up from the bar and held steady as she turned to the young elf, &quot;Your innocence is refreshing, but none that went to Mistmoore can ever be that way again. We have seen evil and once the knowledge that such exists in our world is a part of us, we can never be innocent again.&quot; Her word said, and a barroom filled with pained listeners, Marlos made her way across the street to the Traveler's Stay to room 4, her room. 1 copper a month, outrageous! <br>
<br>
&quot;Many entered Mistmoore, few returned unscathed&quot;<br>

Every tree, every rock had the rotting stink of trolls on it.  It was their swamp and their home land and Marlos Battleborne was not at home here. <br>
<br>
&quot;Go now to Guk and kill the Shin Lord.  He frequents a tavern in newer portion of that place.  If you do this great act and prove your bravery as well as loyalty to the Vanguard of the Iron Crown, I shall knight you myself, squire.&quot; Yppans Elemaster, Knight of the Council, Head of the Ninth circle of the Vanguard of the Iron Crown, Marlos Battleborne sworn Liege Lord had sent her here. <br>
<br>
The swamp stank, and Marlos was there alone...  &quot;Take any three Vanguardians you wish to accomplish this task, but they must not exceed you by more than 3 levels in their chosen professions, nor you exceed them by more than three.  I'll not be having another do this for you nor will I allow you to take one who would be slain for you in your escape.  Take heed Battleborne, I know whom your Gawd is, and be that as it is this task must be more stealth and tactic then frontal assault.&quot;  Yppans had been very clear that this was a task for a more tactic minded individual than he believed Marlos to be...  Marlos wondered if he was right. <br>
<br>
She had sought aid...  Kylik hefted his mighty axe and bid her good luck but misfortune had him need else where...  Annzabeth blessed Marlos and prayed to her own gawd for her well being, but the needs of the Norrath's sick and wounded had her time spent closer to great battles...   Rizzo found his family in greater need than a wood elf strayed from the forest and sought their company in nature...  Banes raised his war hammer in salute to Marlos' bravery, but found his life's calling demanded him to be closer to the dwarven hold...  So now Marlos Battleborne went forth to Guk, unaccompanied. <br>
<br>
Through the swamp she made her way.  Every on edge from the stench of trolls, but avoiding their sight.  Then on to the front entrance of guk. The Froglok Guards scowled at her, but did not leave their assigned posts holding cautiously against the trolls. <br>
<br>
Marlos had a song.  Digging in her pack she found her minotaur horn, a gift from an admirer ages past, and she played for the frogloks.  They we music lovers it seemed for the stop scowling at her though there were still dubious looks on their faces. <br>
<br>
The slime in Guk was everywhere.  Frogloks produces the on their skin, and it covered everything.  Marlos tried not to notice, but there were even places in the halls where she slid across the floor from the slippery slime. No matter how she tried, she was covered in it less time than it took to come across the first froglok. <br>
<br>
Marlos entered Guk, and played her music for those frogloks as well.  It seemed all frogloks like music.  On appreciative froglok sentry gave her warning that the Fungus people were not music lovers how ever and she best stand clear of that lot.  She asked direction to the tavern that she might have a drink and give a song or two.  She was on her way. <br>
<br>
She found the bar room, but the froglok would not server her.  From room to room she went, looking for a patron willing to trade drink for song, but none would even answer her hails to them.  Frogloks were very rude, but then this was not a pleasure trip. <br>
<br>
In the fourth room she found not Frogloks, but a human and two elves.  They jump as she entered and pulled her in.  With swords at her she was questioned, &quot;Who are thee!  State your allegiance!&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;I am Marlos Battleborne, Bard of Rallos Zek.&quot;  Marlos thought it best she keep her answers short and vague.  This was a place for her to make more known of her than she know of them.  &quot;and whom might you be sirs?&quot;  She was not about to let them think she was shaken by three armed males.  She was a bard of Rallos Zek and her boldness was not to be mistaken.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Rallos Zek!&quot; The rancor in the human's voice was clear. &quot;Don't tell me that war monger has thrown his lot in with these foul creatures.&quot;  It was clear by his arrogance that this human was no warrior, though his dress spoke other wise.<br>
<br>
 &quot;What are you doing here Paladin?&quot; Marlos made her prettiest expression.  If she had called him a shadow knight and he were a paladin, he'd kill her.  If he were a shadow knight, he'd find the mistake amusing, and then likely kill her for sport.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I am Kalvarin, Paladin of Erollisi Marr, at your service.&quot;  There was a lilt in his voice.  A paladin of the gawddess of love, no mistake had been made in recognizing Marlos' gender.  By Marlos' measure, he was a fool, as most paladins are and all men seemed to become when they thought her more woman than warrior. <br>
<br>
&quot;You have not answered the question Sir Kalvarin...  What are you three paladins doing so deep in Guk?..  Certainly you are not here for hospitality of the frogloks.&quot;  She gave a coy smile.  These might be the arms men she needed for her task. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are here to recover a holy sword.  A froglok lord has taken possession of it and as the sword is blessed but has no will of it's own, it serves him.&quot; His faces was expressionless, though it was clear it pained him to speak of such.  &quot;Lady bard, how much do you know of these frogloks you've come to entertain?&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos did not correct him on his assessment of her purpose here.  For now that suited her until she learned more of these three.  &quot;I know little of anything.  I sing and play my music.  Little else matters, but please do share you story.  There may be a song in it.&quot;  Her lie did not weigh heavy on her as Rallos Zek had no displeasure from lies.  There was little honor in words truth or otherwise where the warlord was concerned.  You actions were what spoke your heart to him.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Ah yes.  Spoken like a true elvish bard.&quot;  A smirk covered the humans face as his fellows paid no heed to their conversation.  &quot;These frogloks have two gawds they worship.  Doing the biddings of each to further the biddings of the other.  They blasphemy both, and server both.  The foremost is Bertoxxulous, the plague bringer.  Every disease know can be found in this slime they have created by their very skin, just past this bar room you will find the fungus people being bred to serve Plague Bringer's needs.  Their second is a blasphemy in and of it's self, Rodcet Nife the Prime Healer.  So on one hand these creature spread disease in all of Norrath and on the other hand they fight disease plaguing the frogloks.  You will find among you audience froglok necromancers and even the Shin Lords whom call themselves paladins.&quot;  The human took a breath as Marlos made mental notes of his words and his demeanor.  &quot;We dear bard are not a strong enough band to root out the plague bringer's minions, so rather we are here to slay the blasphemers and reclaim the holy sword, Ghoulbane.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos was taken back.  She knew of Ghoulbane.  It was said to be the most powerful weapon of good on all of Norrath.  It's very presence banished evil undead.  &quot;I am not here to perform.&quot;  Her words were out before she had recovered her senses.  &quot;I am a squire to the Vanguard of the Iron Crown.  I am here to slay the Shin Lord as I was commanded by Yppans Elemaster, Knight of the Council.&quot; <br>
<br>
Silence...  &quot;Where is your war party Vanguardian?&quot;  Vattan, one of the high elf paladins, asked in disbelief. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have come alone.&quot;  Marlos was just starting to understand why this task must be done.  She had doubted that this was any more than just a test of her abilities, but now she knew it was not a test, but a task that needed doing.  A task she must do at all costs.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Alone!&quot; Vattan's voice rose, and found himself silenced by the hand of his fellow.  In elvish he continued, &quot;Go home girl.  this is no place for you. You are not a match for the Shin Lord, and you are a fool to do a rogue's duty young bard.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ignoring Vattan's uses of an unknown tongue, Kalvarin spoke, &quot;It is not the Vanguard's way to do such secretive one person strikes.  Why send you here alone?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I was not command to come here alone, it is simply how fate has made it... There are so many froglok's though.&quot;  Marlos wanted to cry as Vattan scolded her and Kalvarin pointed out the futility of her acts. <br>
<br>
In elvish, &quot;Go home child.  Leave this task to we whom must do it.  This is no place for a 29th song bard to find victory alone.&quot;  Vattan was not harsh in his words, for he himself was a 32nd level paladin, and found himself in harm's way as he warned her away from a young death. <br>
<br>
Kalvarin shrugged off Vattan strange ramblings, &quot;Marlos Battleborne, I have need of your service.  As a Vanguardian, I know I can trust this to you.&quot; His voice was even, but there was a light in his eyes.  He saw a victory in some secret war known only to him.  &quot;There is an envoy from Halas awaiting the arrival of the Shin Lord.  I believe they seek an alliance with the Froglok's.  If you can make it to them and make clear what the frogloks are about, perhaps you will have served Norrath more.  An alliance between barbarians and Frogloks would be unholy at best.&quot; <br>
<br>
Barbarian?  Marlos had spent a bit of time in that frozen land. and spoke thier tongue well.  What would those of the frozen north be doing here?  &quot;I shall look in on them, but I make no promises.&quot;  Marlos went to the door finding worry in the elven eyes that followed her and hope in those near blind human ones. <br>
<br>
In Froglok tongue, &quot;Barbarians may I enter to entertain you?&quot;  Marlos had mastered the Froglok's language, and coxed her voice to make even the most perfect gurgles and croaks that spoke her as a learned student of their tongue. <br>
<br>
&quot;By the Hammers of the Tribunal stop the racket!&quot;  A voice came from with in the room speaking common.  Something about it struck Marlos as familiar. She pushed by the curtain and entered the barbarian's room. <br>
<br>
In Barbarian tongue, &quot;Hail Barbarians.&quot;  Marlos looked upon the armored form seated in a much too small chair in obvious discomfort and as covered in slime as she her self had become.  &quot;Hail Wulfhere, Wolf of the North and slayer of Redwind.&quot; <br>
<br>
The barbarian shifted to look at her as he responded, &quot;I am Wulfhere, and Redwind did die by my hand, but to be honest that campaign was lead by a vanguardian Knight and our victory truly that of a simple squire... MARLOS!&quot;  As his eyes set upon the elven bard, his voice rang through the halls of Guk.  Upset croaks were raised in protest of his voice, but he paid them little heed.  &quot;Marlos Battleborne, is it truly you?  Zek curse my eyes if it isn't good to see you girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Before Marlos could respond the barbarian warrior had her under her arms and lifted to his face.  She had seen this act preformed with barbarian children all to often and felt her rising ire as she was treated as a child by this huge creature who was her friend.  She was seated on his lap as he called out, &quot;Shaman put away those magik potions and come in around here.  We've an honored guest.&quot; <br>
<br>
Cryton, Shaman of the Justice, came around from behind the warrior.  &quot;I heard, as I expect most of Guk heard brother.  Marlos.  It is good to see you again.&quot;  Cryton turned a scolding eye to his fellow.  &quot;Might be wise to let that lady down Wulfhere, mind you, she's not a child.&quot;  Wulfhere nearly dropped Marlos as he realized what he had done. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry my lady, I meant no disrespect...  It's just so good to see a friendly face.  We've been waiting here for weeks to...&quot; As Wulfhere told Marlos of Tribunal's judgment against the trolls and their sought alliance to destroy them,  Marlos shared what she had learned of the Frogloks. <br>
<br>
&quot;If such is as you say dear lady,&quot; Cryton's eyes narrowed as he sensed the wrong doings all around him, &quot;Then our tentative ally, is truly an enemy as well as those trolls whom surely trained Redwind.&quot;  Justice was in Cryton's blood.  He drank of it often.  Right and wrong, no gray was seen by him. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have come to slay the Shin Lord, Cryton.  I know now I can not do so alone and hope to survive, but it must be done.&quot;  Marlos had more here than Kalvarin had suspected.  She would not simply send the barbarians on their way.  She was Vanguard of the Iron Crown, and this was her battle field.  By Rallos Zek she would meet her enemy on it and by Zek she would be victorious.  &quot;Will you aid me in my cause dear Cryton?&quot; <br>
<br>
Wulfhere grunted.  Cryton may be the Shaman of Justice, but when had any shaman cut down an enemies arms men?  &quot;I will aid you girly.  Let the shaman think on it, but for me it is decided.&quot;  Wulfhere made his decision for himself no matter who he had set over himself.  &quot;As I followed you against Redwind, I shall follow you against the Shin Lord, and if necessary I shall cut you a path through an enemy army to get to him.&quot;  No boasting was in his words, and that made them set even harder in the air. <br>
<br>
&quot;My brother has spoken wisely, perhaps he should have been a shaman.  It shall be us three again then.&quot;  Cryton gathered his potions as Wulfhere belted on his twin blades. <br>
<br>
Marlos smiled to herself.  This time she had an army.  &quot;Not us three, dear Cryton.&quot;  Wouldn't those paladins be surprised.  &quot;Come and I shall show you&quot; <br>
<br>
Steel flashed as Marlos brought her barbarian war party into the paladin's chamber.  &quot;What is this!&quot;  Demanded Kalvarin.  His eyes wide as he looked upon the barbarian warrior.<br>
<br>
 &quot;A war party of Justice&quot; Marlos smiled as the 5 men introduced each other. <br>
<br>
&quot;Paladins come to kill a paladin?&quot; Wulfhere's words rang off sound even as he spoke them.  &quot;There seems no logic in that, but I shall like the aid if you are true, or cut through you if you are false.  I am here for the lady Marlos, and she believes in you.&quot; <br>
<br>
A smile fell over Vattan's face even as Wulfhere's words cut into Kalvarin's pride.  He knew the nature of barbarian's honor, and he knew that Marlos was all that truly mattered to the warrior in this party. <br>
<br>
Frogloks were lured into the room and slain systematically before they could call for aid.  Guk was used to the barbarians making noise and paid little heed to the sounds of sword play, as it was Wulfhere habit to practice often. <br>
<br>
After a long battle, the Shin Lord found his time to come to the bar room. Making his way to the barbarian's to discuss business he was shocked to find blades upon him, but not over whelmed.  &quot;What is this?&quot; he croaked out in Common tongue. <br>
<br>
&quot;We have come for the Ghoulbane,&quot; Kalvarin demanded as his sword was deflected by the Shin lord's lithe movements. <br>
<br>
&quot;Follow, I've not got the Ghoulbane.&quot; the Shin Lord dealt back blow for blow to his opponents.  &quot;Do you think me the only Shin Lord in Guk?  We are an entire guild, and it is one of my brothers whom has that great weapon.&quot; With a snarl the Shin Lord knocked a Kalvarin to his knees, but the fast magiks of Cryton's healings brought him back in force.  &quot;And you barbarians, coming under the guise of treaty!&quot;  The Shin Lord healed himself and had at Wulfhere with a vengeful ire.  &quot;I know now why we sent that orc to Everfrost to bring you Plague and suffering.&quot;  Glee was in the Froglok's eyes at those words.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Orc?&quot;  Wulfhere was off balance, and the Shin Lord took full advantage, putting a fatal wound in his chest.  &quot;Orc?&quot; as Wulfhere fell, Vattan caught him with a prayer and a single hand of faith.  Wulfhere lived. <br>
<br>
A scowl crossed the Shin Lord's face as Wulfhere regained his balance.  He ran out of the room ignoring Marlos' chains of music.  Hordes of Frogloks came to his aid, but Wulfhere was good to his word.  Cutting his way to the Shin Lord, &quot;What Orc!&quot; he demanded as the paladins widened the gap he cut. <br>
<br>
As the Shin Lord fell, he smiled.  He knew he had earned immortality in his life and that the Froglok Necromancers would bring him back even stronger as a Froglok Shin Ghoul Knight.  With his last breathe of life he whispered, &quot;May Redwind destroy you home and your children barbarian.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos acted quickly, grabbing the trophy of her victory, and calling for a full party retreat.  The paladins kept each other and the rest a live on their retreat, even as all the frogloks in Guk came down on them.  They made it out. <br>
<br>
Covered in slime and knowing the success of her mission, Marlos felt victorious.  As she turned, and looked into Kalvarin's face, that feeling faded.  &quot;A whole Guild of Shin Lords.&quot; his voice sounded empty.  &quot;We must go back.  The Ghoulbane must not be held by such as those.  If we must kill a thousand Shin Lords and a hundred thousand Frogloks, we must succeed.&quot; Marlos' heart sank. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's suicide.&quot;  Marlos knew her words were to be ignored, but she must speak them.  &quot;There are so many in that place that you will never make it back in, and if you do, then what?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then we do what must be done, as is the way of a paladin.&quot;  Vattan's words were in Common for the first time.  Marlos wasn't sure he had known the tongue.  His fellow paladins nodding sagely as they worked to heal them selves and each other.  &quot;It may be a life's work, recovering the Ghoulbane. We may never find the Shin Lord who holds the icon of our faith, but we must follow that faith.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marlos was moved.  &quot;You paladins are fools, everyone of you.&quot;  There was no reply to her protests...  Wulfhere looked at her, and then to Cryton.... &quot;Well, don't just sit there, let's go then!&quot;  Marlos' stern look failed to hide her worry.  She'd not leave these brave fools in need. <br>
<br>
Wulfhere smiled and brought Cryton to his feet.  &quot;Right, back to battle.&quot; The barbarian warrior knew he was not expected to follow, and knew Cryton was expected even less.  But the barbarians were a race of honor and justice, and there was a debt to be paid. <br>
<br>
Raising a clouding song, Marlos brought her war party back their battle field with out incidence.  There they made their stand and slew frogloks and the occasional Shin Lord until fatigue of battle drove them home...   The Ghoulbane was not recovered, and the Paladins battle there still.<br>

  <br>
&quot;Knowledge!..  Ha!..&quot;  For a thousand thousand years he had seen the process of life, and the follies of those who'd not survived as he.  &quot;What I can share is tales, but the knowledge must be gleamed from them yourselves.&quot; <br>
  <br>
&quot;Then share you tales and I shall listen with a keen ear.&quot; proclaimed the sand giant.  &quot;If there is Knowledge there, I shall not miss it, of that I am certain.&quot;  The boldness in the young giant's statements irked the ancient cyclops.  What story to tell he wondered...  Then this one came to him.... <br>
  <br>
In the mountains of Rathe there was a pair.   One a Hill giant of great power and the other a cyclops of growing age and wisdom.  They often conversed and found game together, but this day was not to be their own. <br>
  <br>
&quot;There are intruders in our domain&quot; the hill giant shared with the cyclops eagerly.  He enjoy crushing the little people and watching them squirm as most giants do. <br>
&quot;Where, good friend?&quot;  as a cyclops the passing of intruders is seldom missed, but these he had not seen. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Follow and I shall show you.&quot;  The hill giant lead his partner around their favored hunting grounds to the outer side of the valley where the four little ones sat unaware of the eyes upon them...  &quot;See there, a wee barbarian, two tiny elves and a stinking human.&quot; <br>
  <br>
<br>
A smile drew across the cyclop's face, &quot;Let's smoosh them.&quot; and with a smirk and a touch of laughter they charged in on the wee ones. <br>
  <br>
&quot;Little Man, Little man, Filled with red!...  I will crush your bones when you are dead!&quot; laughed the cyclops as his hand swatted at the wee ones. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Shit!...  This is going to hurt.&quot;  the human warrior of his 29th season cried to his 3 friends. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone on the hill giant!&quot;  Cried the desperate elven bard as her eye drifted to her dear friends.  She would not fail them this day she vowed as she worried over her newest 31st song. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Your foul deeds have not gone unnoticed Silverron!&quot; growled the hill giant and he felt a slight poke of the fool hearty elf's halberd. <br>
  <br>
<br>
A song rose to the cyclop's ears.  It beckoned him, &quot;Love me as I love you....  My love is yours and you love is mine....  Protect me my love...  Love me...  Save me.&quot;  and the cyclops felt it in his heart.  The elf woman, so small and so lovely.  He did love her, he knew he did.  &quot;My pet attack him&quot; a blue hand gestured to the hill giant brutalizing the wee ones.  <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't taunt!&quot; cried the bard to her fellows. <br>
  <br>
<br>
The hill giant turned at his fellow, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; He asked as he returned blows to the crazed cyclops.  And the cyclops found his wits, turning on the wee elf who's music had dimmed his wits. <br>
  <br>
<br>
She sang again as her fellows tried to take the hill giants attention off of her, but the cyclops was not so easily fooled again.  The cyclops and the hill giant made short work slamming the little nothing bard toward her doom. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Marlos run!&quot; Screamed the barbarian shaman as he worked hard to strengthen her with the gifts the tribunal had bestowed upon him. <br>
  <br>
<br>
The cyclops heart was moved and he stepped between the hill giants death giving blow and the bard's weak form.  &quot;No!&quot; he cried at the hill giant appalled that his brother would raise hands against such beauty that he had found love in.  &quot;Rallos Zek have thee!&quot;  calling a pray to the creator of the giants the cyclops beat upon the hill giants chest. <br>
  <br>
<br>
The barbarian raised his beloved elf to near perfect health.  She had been his companion for many battles and he'd not let her die this day. <br>
  <br>
<br>
As fast as the love had entered the cyclops heart for the bard, so did it leave with only rage in it's place.  He turned on her with hatred in his heart.  &quot;Wood Elves like you hold only contempt in my heart&quot;. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Cryton I need a heal fast.&quot;  the human warrior feared for his life as the hill giant found a taste for his blood.  The barbarian quickly met the warrior's needs placing him well on the better side of health. <br>
  <br>
<br>
The bard fumbled with her songs as an enraged cyclops pounded her.  Raising a pray to her gawd, Rallos Zek, as she neared her demise.  Again the song of sirens had her attacker's heart.   She fled the battle so near death that life was nearly a fanciful dream.  Her barbarian ally gave her all he could and she found herself on the border of safe levels of health. <br>
  <br>
<br>
She sang her song and the cyclops landed blow after blow upon his fellow, the hill giant. <br>
&quot;Completely out of mana!&quot; the barbarian screamed to his warring allies.  The Elven paladin chain cast heals upon himself and the human warrior at his side.  It was the hill giant was winning this battle with the two wee fighters. <br>
  <br>
<br>
The cyclops found his senses, but only long enough to charge at the bard before his heart ached to save her from the hill giant he had called friend.  The hill giant paid no heed to the cyclops intending to smoosh the wee ones and then have a long talk later with his confused fellow. <br>
  <br>
<br>
Again the light of reason the the rage born of the treachery of the wood elf bard was the cyclop's own.  He charged to the bard and pound her with all he could.  She would die this time by his hands , of that he was certain. <br>
  <br>
<br>
Her song rang in his ears as he ignored it and beat the tiny thing.  She was certain to be his. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Cryton I am out of mana...  heal her!&quot;  the high elf's heart dropped as he furiously hacked at the now weakening hill giant.  This battle was going bad, and him with out his strength gathered to lay on hands. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;I can yet Silverron, No mana!&quot;  the barbarian panicked as he watch his dear friends death nearing.  &quot;Run Marlos! Run! Run!&quot; <br>
  <br>
Looking upon this battle, the Gawd of War, Rallos Zek, Warlord of the Universe smiled.  <br>
  <br>
The bard felt her life failing.  She was weakened in body, but her heart was pure and she did not fear or hate death.  If she died, then she did not deserve to survive.  That was the way of her gawd and her religion.  With praise raised to the Warlord in her heart, she sang to the cyclops and his heart moved. <br>
  <br>
<br>
Turning on the Hill Giant the cyclops laid blows that stagger the minds of most warriors. <br>
 And when the hill giant fell dead, the cyclops returned to the bard's side to protect her against all that would do her harm.  She was his and he was hers.<br>
<br>
  <br>
<br>
The Barbarian got his mana out to heal her as the cyclops realized what he had done.  His friend, his fellow for longer than most being's lives was dead by his own hands.  &quot;I really hate bards like you!&quot; he bellowed as he slammed his fists at her, but she didn't die.  The barbarian's magic gave her life even as he struck her down. <br>
  <br>
<br>
The paladin's halberd ripped the side of the cyclops as the warrior poke him with his sword making his presence and intent known. <br>
  <br>
<br>
Playing a healing hymn as the fighters beat the cyclops, the bard saw victory in this battle. <br>
And victory was theirs, as the cyclops fell. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;You are brave dear lady&quot; the barbarian shared as they drew near to tend each other's wounds and share a healing hymn. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Dear Cryton, we have been in worse shape then that many times&quot; smiled the wood elf woman as she bound the wounds on her elven paladin...  There was something about him, even if he wasn't a particularly handsome elf.   <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;You were very close to death girl&quot; offered the barbarian to the distraction of the wood elf. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;I was worried&quot; the high elf seemed intact and his concern touched the bard.  She hugged him...  Even if he's not a particularly handsome elf. <br>
  <br>
&quot;What knowledge to you find giant?&quot;  the ancient cyclops offer the question in challenge to the arrogance of the sand giant. <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Clearly old one...  This simple shows that cyclops are fools.&quot;  the giant was appalled that the ancient had shared such worthless lore.  &quot;what four wee ones of so little skill could possible do what you say these did were it not so!?&quot; <br>
  <br>
<br>
&quot;Fools?&quot; amused by the short sightedness of his unwanted student, the ancient cyclops found no other words to share.   <br>
  <br>
<br>
The sand giant growled as he walked across the sands back to the Oasis he called home, leaving the ancient cyclops in peace. <br>
  <br>
<br>
With a smile, &quot;Rallos Zek, bless that young fool...  He thought the story was about giants.&quot;  Amused laughter echoed as far as the troll's swamp.   <br>

<br>
<br>
 Ahead of her in circle of trees she spied a familiar sight, though on she had not held since she fled her failure at the Guild of Faydark's Champions, the warriors guild where she learned of Rallos Zek and her own short comings in the skills of a warrior.  The in that circle was her father, which meant that her mother would be one of those trees. <br>
<br>
<br>
 She approached the old warrior working his sword.  Old is perhaps not the right word for his appearance.  He's an elf, and once an elf reaches 20 years, their appearance seldom changes.  This warrior Marlos sees as old, in fact retains all the youthful beauty and grace born in to every elf since the first had life breathed into her by the mother of all.  In Marlos' eyes, this warrior was as grizzled and battle worn as any human warrior would have been with a bare thousandth of his life's work. <br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;I hear you approaching, elf.  Show yourself friend or foe.&quot;  With out breaking his attentions on his sword practice, the old warrior was alert to all of the world around him with startling detail.<br>
 &quot;Marlos!  You've returned to us...  Put your toys away you silly man and a make a welcome for you daughter.&quot;  To the unknowing eye, an ancient tree turned on it's roots and transformed into a female elf with such elegant beauty that none but another elf could behold her and not stare.  Her words came at a rush unheeding of the graceful tones that hung to them, but though the words were welcoming, the face of Marlos' mother was mixed worried concern and fearful expectation. <br>
<br>
<br>
 With out breaking his routine, the old warrior did not even spare a glance for his daughter returned from her long absence.  &quot;Come to steal my sword no doubt.&quot;  Shifting stances with a fluid movement which left no opening of an enemies blade, &quot;You call yourself a rogue now, no doubt.&quot;  Sword cutting the air first near his feet and not a breathe later at neck height for an ogre.  There was no doubt that this elf could put his wicked blade any where he needed it to go with out so much as a thought to what was needed.  &quot;I heard of your expulsion from the guild.  Couldn't even hold your tears to retain the last bit of your honor.  Well, under the circumstances, Scouts Guild was about the best you'd be getting.&quot;  With not even a glance to the women the warrior sheathed his sword with the grace and stature of a general before his armies.  &quot;That a child of mine should be a thief though, That I never considered.  You bring shame upon our entire clan.&quot;  With his words said, he started out of the circle with his back to Marlos and her mother. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Tears streamed down Marlos' cheeks.  She had spent her life wanting this one elf to be proud of her, and now he shunned her for reasons that held no truth.   She had never considered that she might become a dreadful rogue instead of a Bard.  What would she have done had she not had the musical aptitude that got her an invitation to the Song Weavers' Guild.<br>
 With desperation driving her, she sang with out a moments thought for words.  She had to hold her father from leaving.  She had to tell him she would never shame him.  She had to.. do something. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Stands of music wrapped around the warrior halting his departure, slowing his ever move.  With angry astonishment in his eyes he turned with extreme lack effort making his every move a labor of patience.  For the first time since her arrival, he looked at Marlos.  He just looked at her and made not another move. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Tears streaked her mother's face, &quot;Blessed Tunare!  She's a Bard!&quot;  Rushing to embrace her daughter, &quot;You are a Bard!  My heart's dearest, you are a bard.&quot;  Mother and daughter held each other as their tears fell on each other's shoulders.  Only another elf could have said there was a days difference in their ages, and that only with the manner they carried on.  To the eyes of the old warrior, there was no sight in the Faydark to draw his eyes from these two.  His Druid Bride with all the grace and beauty the she had when they married thousands of years before the birth of the most beloved elf in his life.  There they were.  His Bride and the Bard, not rogue, he had held while she took her first breath. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Even after the strands of music had faded, the warrior simply stood where he had been stopped.  When the women approached him, one timidly and the other with a reproachful look in her eyes which promised an eternity of paying for his rudeness, he stood his ground.<br>
 &quot;Father, I am sorry.  Please forgive me.  I wasn't thinking and I acted hastily.&quot;  Tears rang in Marlos' voice.  She knew that she should not have bound him, but she was ready for whatever her punishment would be. <br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;Daughter, my Dearest Marlos, I know better than to taunt and then turn my back.  I'm just lucky you didn't put a knife in me.&quot;  For the first time in too long, Marlos felt the smile of her father beaming at her.  She knew why she had come home.  &quot;Tell us of your adventures and how you managed to get into the most exclusive Guild in the Faydark.&quot;<br>
 Marlos told her story, and smiles to to looks of Astonishment. <br>
<br>
  <br>
<br>
 &quot;Vanguard of the Iron Crown!&quot;  Her father's voice still crackled with emotion when he repeated words.  &quot;Knight Lieutenant and Knight Diplomat!&quot; <br>
<br>
 &quot;Oh hush dear.&quot;  With a druids calm, her mother had absorbed every word of her child's adventures.  &quot;So tell me about this High Elf Paladin you find so worthy of you attention.&quot;<br>
 With a blush, Marlos continued on with her most recent battles.  &quot;There is an out post of trolls in the Mountains of Rathe.  I have caught a taste for killing trolls, but with the rediscovery of the Kunark continent.  I think I must head there.  I fear the Vanguard may need me at this already.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;Trolls!  You kill trolls!?&quot;  Marlos had never seen her father so agitated, and she did not know how to take his reactions to her stories.  She wasn't lying to them, and she was perfectly honest about how scared she was most of the time.  Her father just didn't seem to grasp her stories. <br>
<br>
 <br>
 &quot;If your Comrades in Arms are waiting for you, then I guess you must go soon.&quot;  Her mother seemed all to willing to accept anything and everything she told her and fish out only which of the men she had thought were brave and valiant.  &quot;After all, with out you keeping an eye on him, it sounds like that Mapleleaf boy will go off and get himself killed.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
 Marlos made ready to go as her mother and father spoke quietly amongst the trees.  As she got her bearings and prepared to head to the dwarf docks, her father came to her side.  <br>
<br>
 &quot;Marlos,&quot;  She turned to him ready to defend her stories and argue her case against what ever her father had decided she was lying about.  &quot;my Dear one, I am honored to have you as a daughter.  Come back to us alive once more when your duty is served.  We love you and we are proud of you.&quot;  With that, Marlos saw what no warrior had ever seen, and she had never dreamed was possible.  She saw a tear in her father's eye.  She kissed his cheek and began her long run back to the Vanguard of the Iron Crown.<br>

<br>
&quot;Marlos, dear Tunare it is you!&quot; Wunderr Mapleleaf greeted her with open arms. &quot;I feared you might never come back to us. You have been gone a long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I said I would return, and I have...&quot; Marlos' eyes darted across the faces of the Vanguard, marking the new ones for memory and searching out her old faithful companions. &quot;Wunderr, Dear you have a battle hardened look to you. When I left your side you I had never considered you so formidable. What have you seen of this continent to make you such?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wunderr's eyes darkened with memories of war and death. &quot;It is a dangerous place m'lady. But the Vanguard has met the danger and flourished.&quot; A smile move across Wunderr's lips never touching the darkness in his eyes. &quot;Let me introduce you to those you do not yet know, and present you to the Vanguard as returned to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Vanguard sweep of the Frontier Mountains went well, but Marlos felt the loss of family she did not see among the Vanguard. War and shaken morale had taken it's toll on her family, but the Vanguard's numbers were bolstered by the introduction of valiant heroes to carry them forward into the breach. It is these new heroes Marlos focuses on as she sang her songs to her family and raise spirits where she could.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for coming&quot; A Ranger told her. &quot;It is nice to finally meet the Lady Marlos in person.&quot; His face bore battle scars, and more lines of deep thought. Not so handsome as an elf, but far more that a human. His eyes held a light that seemed to shine through Marlos.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't have missed it m'Lord.&quot; Marlos' felt uncomfortable before this Ranger's eyes, which bothered her to her core. She had stared down Trolls and made them flee in terror, or stood toes to toe with a giant never fearing for her and her fellow's victory. This ranger had no right to look at her such. How dare he!<br>
<br>
&quot;IF you ever need me, m'Lady- call and I will be to your side.&quot; There was no lilt in the Ranger's voice to imply more than the comradery of his words. With no ceremony, he was gone.<br>
<br>
Marlos fumed. &quot;At least he could have...&quot; Startled, Marlos put an end to that thought before she had to admit to herself what she'd have wanted him to do. <br>
&quot;What has he done to me?&quot; Marlos pondered the thought as she went out to explore the land of Kunark.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
<br>
Called out to the Guild, &quot;Who is coming to Trakanon's Teeth to help get keys to Old Sebilis?&quot; The Ranger's words echoed in Marlos' mind. She was going to to hunt Bloodgill Goblins to recover a coin for Wellin Fargan. She did not have time to waste looking for keys to a forgotten city's ruins.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was going to hunt Bloodgills, but you can count me in.&quot; Marlos' words went out to the Vanguard even before she had decided what she was about. She did not want to hunt frogloks forager and hunters, why did she commit. They didn't need her, and she is far from needing a key. &quot;I wouldn't miss it for the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
She met the Ranger again in the Swamp of No Hope. She had see him about Norath at Vanguard gatherings, but she had avoided his eyes. This time there was no avoiding his gaze as the stood face to face. He had taken the form of a wolf, but his eyes were the same.<br>
<br>
Marlos wondered if she was taking an ailment. Her heart raced, and she sweated as she felt a chill. &quot;I really wanted to go hunt Blood Gill Goblins today, but since you are gathering Vanguard here, I will never be able to get enough together to do what I wanted to do.&quot; She turned an accusing glare on the wolf.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will help you afterward if you like m'Lady.&quot; The Ranger's voice seemed to douse Marlos' anger with it's first sounding, and by the time he had made his promise all Marlos could do was grumble half heartedly.<br>
<br>
Vanguard formed up and defeated those that came against them. Marlos held herself away from the Ranger, and he seemed oblivious to her as he thought only of seeking out frogloks and luring them back to their deaths in the trap set by the Vanguard. <br>
<br>
&quot;You sing beautifully m'Lady.&quot; Marlos jumped at the ranger's voice off to her side. What was HE doing sneaking up on her like that?! The nerve of some men!<br>
<br>
&quot;It's my job, dear.&quot; Marlos replied curtly to forestall any conversation the Ranger might have hoped to make by his sneaking tactics.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have gotten Keys for everyone, now where does everyone want to go?&quot; The question posed to the party was Marlos' que. She needed to be away from this Ranger's continual presence, and the palpable loss of it when he ran off scouting.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to get the coins for the banker. I said I would, and I need to.&quot; Marlos put that thought in her mind, and fled from all other thoughts that crept in on her.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is one held in Kaesora, so we go there. Who is with us?&quot; The Ranger's voice seemed to mock Marlos' hopeless desire to ignore it as it rang true in her mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll go.&quot; Korez, Tanilla and Chevalier spoke up immediately. Soon followed by the agreement of others. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As the journey side tracked some party members, they found themselves numbering 4 at the Field of Bone. To Marlos' joy and turmoil, the Ranger was there still. Infact, there were 3 rangers, a rogue and her. Not a great healer amongst them, but only the one ranger seemed to have her in a distraction.<br>
<br>
They moved into the crumbling ruins, and jumped blindly into the depths of the forgotten hells. Spiders were on them as they made their way, ever jumping from skeletons and ghosts. Nothing posed a great threat to their combined skills and the rangers made haste at practicing their meek healing abilities.<br>
<br>
The Ranger would go out looking for monstrous beasts to bring to the small group to destroy, and each time Marlos' heart wept for his absence. Why did he have to go?! What's he trying to prove? Crazy foolish Ranger!<br>
<br>
Time wore down and soon the Rogue had to take leave of thier presence. There was no fear in her, as Chevalier left for more pressing matters.<br>
<br>
As Tanilla slept, Korez, and Marlos waited for the Ranger to return. The three of them battled on, but the lack was felt and they were soon not having the ranger venture far beyond the immediate area. <br>
<br>
Tanilla returned to us, and our strength of arms with her, but Marlos feared for the ranger's safety as he ventured out. <br>
<br>
As they battled on, a second monster fell upon them, and then a third and a fourth came into being as they wagered their lives on victory.<br>
<br>
Korez fell, to the 5th beast that came upon his blind side with a crippling assult. His loss was not long followed by Tanilla as the murdering mob turned it's attentions to her. Marlos called to two of them, and knew they would not last if Tanilla fell.<br>
<br>
Marlos and the Ranger stood side by side, as in some warrior's dream, facing down the monsters with no hope of retreat or salvation. Marlos watched the ranger out of the corner of her eye. His face a study of warrior calm. The same warrior calm that held Marlos' knees from shaking. Why doesn't he call a retreat, at least to the spider covered rooms so that we might have hope that some one might find us before we decay and become a part of the undead citizens.<br>
<br>
There was no retreat. No warrior would have called one, except to save his fellows. Here death was coming, and this Ranger held with a warrior's heart. Marlos' fell, and her last sight was of the Ranger guarding her body with his sword and life against impossible odds.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
<br>
When Marlos opened her eyes, she could not even remember her name, but the vision of a Ranger standing over her as a guardian angel was hard in her mind. &quot;You are resurrected lady elf. Sit and take the time you need to clear the clouds from your mind and return life and strength to your limbs.&quot; A cleric was there. Marlos thought he must be a cleric anyhow, but what she was, she did not know.<br>
<br>
&quot;There was a Ranger.&quot; The voice sounded famuliar, and it came from her throat. There was a Ranger, of that she was sure.<br>
<br>
&quot;They are well. They are resurrected and their minds and bodies are well. They wait outside.&quot; The cleric's voice was comforting.<br>
<br>
&quot;They?&quot; Marlos' mind swarmed with things she knew she knew. &quot;There was a Ranger. He was here, and he was...&quot; Her words trailed off as he mind swooned with confused thoughts. She stumbled outside and was accosted by the roar of living voices.<br>
<br>
&quot;Marlos!!!&quot;, that's what her name was! Fattik ran up and hugged her. She knew him, and she knew the cleric with him, Annzabeth. &quot;We came as soon as you came up missing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;With an army?&quot; Marlos' eyes fell on Joaquin, and Aliena, and Vanguardians, and Nomadic Brothers, but where was the ranger? &quot;I must find someone Fattik, please excuse me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marlos found Korez and Tanilla. She had her wits back, and she remembered their plight. &quot;Where...&quot; The Ranger returned from scouting up the hall cutting Marlos' words short as she release a breath she did not know she had held.<br>
<br>
&quot;Marlos! Good, I was getting concerned.&quot; The Ranger seemed to pass over her with his eyes and then ignored her. Marlos wanted to cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Joaquin, dear can you take us out of here.&quot; Marlos called her dear brother close. &quot;I need to go to Ferroott.&quot;<br>
<br>
Joaquin knew his sister well. He did not ask any questions, since she had not abandoned to the world when he proclaimed his love for a dark elven ShadowKnight to their parents. &quot;To Ferroott we go.&quot;<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
In Ferroott the group said their farewells, and Joaquin whispered to Marlos the words of a brother. &quot;He's cute for a halfhuman, but if you keep staring like that you might actually see him aging.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to go see Zulort, Joaquin. I am not well, and I need prayer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are well, Marlos.&quot; Joaquin grinned evilly, &quot;but you do need prayer.&quot; Marlos ran off to try to seek the answers for her troubled heart, as Joaquin mused to himself over his baby sister's elven adolescence. <br>

Most days she would be comforted by the surrounding trees of the Ferroott, but she hardly noticed them today. Troubled by recent events and the ever present strain on her heart that pulled her to Kunark. The Ranger was there, somewhere- but Marlos refused to admit that it was a pull to him -It was Kunark she found alluring, not the presence of a Half-human.<br>
<br>
As she made her smiles in passing to the Oggok Guards, cursing Cazic Thule under her breathe for his taint on the Ogres of Oggok, her thoughts wandered to to what she would say to Zulort.<br>
Marlos respected the Ogres. Like the Giants and orcs, Ogres were the creation of the Warlord, made solely for the purpose of battle.<br>
Zulort, High Shaman of the Shaman of War, was waiting in the guild house in his normal spot as Marlos approach.<br>
&quot;Ullo lil'alfie. Hu yu ta dey?&quot; Marlos smiled dispite her mood. She knew that slanted words disguised a wisdom that ran deep in this Ogre.<br>
&quot;Honestly, Great Zulort, my heart is heavy.&quot; With a light voice she shared with Zulort all that weighed on her soul, and though she tried not to be forth-right about the Ranger, she could not hold the truth from The sly ears of the High Shaman.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hur Hur,&quot; Zulort's booming laughter echoed off the walls. &quot;Wut yu tink yu hab wrung wit yu, Merlus?&quot;<br>
<br>
Marlos had hoped and even convinced herself that Zulort would simply have a magic enchantment that would lift her heart. Why was he asking her what this ailment was. After all he was the shaman! &quot;I don't know! I think it must be a curse, or a charm spell. Maybe Agalkin is playing a joke on me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dis no mojo dat be werked. Dis be da werks ub eh mich mer powrfil ting...&quot; Taking a momment to look at Marlos as he arranged his thoughts, Zulort began to smile. &quot;Hu ole er yu, Merlus? Ib yu wer un Ogre, whut be yu?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How old am I?&quot; Marlos had seen human cringew from the truth of that question, but Zulort was not really asking her years so much as her youth. &quot;I am 340 years old. For an elf, that's about the same as a 90 year-old Ogre, or even a 16 year old human.&quot; Marlos had never really thought about what her age might mean to others. She had been accustom to her immortality before her mother would even let her leave the high trees of her home.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yu be bery ole Merlus, bit yu be bery yung tu. No be ole nuf ta merri ib yu be an Ogre, bit yu no a Ogre.&quot; Scratching his head Zulort studied the Lady elf he had grown to respect. Trying to see her as a young Ogre, while looking at her tiny elf form. The years she had seen would make her a middle aged Ogre if she had been born of his own race, and that made the reality even harder to understand. &quot;Merlus, um... Yu kno were babs cum ferm?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?! What kind of question is that? Of course I know where babies come from.&quot; Shock rang the respectful tone from Marlos' voice. &quot;I am not doing that either. I am not even old enough to think about that! What kind of sick thing are you suggesting?! I am not...&quot;<br>
<br>
Waving his large hands to fend off the onslaught of Marlos' words, Zulort recoiled from the little elf's flying hands. &quot;Me jus askin! Me no use ta takin ta alf girs bot dis duf!&quot; As Marlos seemed taking her second breathe to continue her verbal assult, Zulort found himself the only redirection he could to a girl of this age. &quot;Meyhap yu sud tak ta yer mudder bout dis. Me no gud wit girs firs lub pans.&quot;<br>
<br>
Caught off guard Marlos could only repeat the words that Zulort had thrown out in haste. &quot;First Love Pains...&quot; she whispered. &quot;but I am too young for...&quot; Her words trailed off as her heart strangled the denial from her thoughts.<br>
Tears refused thier captures any longer as they ran down Marlos' cheeks. Zulort's heart broke as he watched Marlos stand there crying. &quot;Eben da grat Warlord, Rallos Zek, ken't tel da Merr ladi ta no tuch er herts. Yu a gir, Merlus. Ladi Merr wil tuch yu. Dat wut she du.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But he's a half Human!&quot; failing to put her normal contempt in the racail title. &quot;Humans live so briefly, and the mixed blood only lengthens thier pain.&quot; Marlos' tears flowed with no thought as she strained through the horror of her hearts desires. &quot;I can't love a human, Zulort. Even a half human.&quot; Zulort took her in his hands gentlely holding her like a small Ogre child. &quot;Even a being half elf, he could live much more than 500 years, and then I have to watch him die... I can't do it!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dat yer chos. yu ken lub em fer 500 yers, and den lus em, er yu ken lus him now en no hab yer 500 yers wit em.&quot; Gentlely petting the little elf's back, Zulort spoke a softly and tenderly as an Ogre's voice allows. &quot;eder wey, yu lus em, me lil alfie. Yu jus hab to chos wen yu du.&quot; <br>
<br>
As Marlos lay in Zulort's hands, holding tight to his massive fingers as she cried, Zulort hummed an Ogre Lulaby often heard in the nurseries of Oggok.<br>
<br>
------- Later on the Continent of Kunark<br>
<br>
Lady Marlos Battleborne walked through the enterance to the Castle of Karnors. With a determined step she ducked arround the inhabitants who searched for the invaders of thier lair.<br>
<br>
She had tracked the Ranger to this castle. The Vanguard knew that he was leading a raiding party against the hordes the plagued the Dreadlands. Marlos would join that raiding party, even if she had to make her way deep into this dangerous lair to do so.<br>
<br>
She found the Ranger's band of brave souls inside the walls, camped by the Moat. &quot;Hail&quot; Marlos called to thier sentries to alert them to her presence in a way that would not decorate her with fletching.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Marlos&quot; Called a voice in return. &quot;What bring you alone to such a place Lady Bard?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I seek to join your party. If you have a place for a lonely bard.&quot; Marlos would not take no for an answer no matter the sittuation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome Marlos&quot; the Ranger's voice made her jump in her skin. He was there. She had found him, and now she just had to make him find her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hail&quot; Marlos offered to theparty and settled into the corner barely glancing at the Ranger as she walked past him. <br>
<br>
The Ranger looked at her as she found a place by the fire and started to chat with one of the casters. His eyes lingering on her for only a momment before the alarm was given that a Drovlarg was come close and needed to be done away with.<br>
<br>
------ Later as the battles lulled<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Lady Marlos&quot; the Ranger settled next to the fire where Marlos was tuning her Mandolin. &quot;Did the banker like the coin collection?&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking at the Ranger, Marlos strained to make out his words as her mind swirled. &quot;Yes.&quot; She should say more, but what? She needed to say more, the silence was lingering. What can she say? Panic was edging in...<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh...&quot; The Ranger broke the silence. &quot;That's Good.&quot; He eyes turned away from Marlos' studied work on her instrument. &quot;Well I need to... Well, you know, we all have our work.&quot; With that the Ranger was gone to speak with another as Marlos plucked at the strings on her mandolin testing thier tones.<br>
<br>
Putting down her mandolin Marlos stared off into the fire. What was she doing here. She couldn't even string two words together with this Ranger looking at her. She had over tightened on of the strings on her Mandolin and almost ruined it as the silence had dragged on between them. 'Oh that would have been great' Marlos admonished herself, 'snap a string in front of him and make a fool of yourself- that'll impress him!'<br>
<br>
------ Time passed slowly<br>
<br>
Marlos refused to follow the Ranger arround, but she always found herself going where ever she could find him. Very Few words passed between them, and she was losing hope.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aliena, I just can't get him to notice me.&quot; Marlos sat at the druid circle in the Dreadlands talking with he fellow Vanguard, and dear friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, maybe he's just the silent type, or maybe he thinks you are just kidding when you flirt with him.&quot; Lady Aliena Heartbreaker had joined Marlos for a bit of Rabbit Stew, and tea. She had not known that her young friend had started noticing the males of Norrath, but found it very entertaining to try to advise Marlos on one of her favorite pass times. &quot;I know when I flirt with him, he just laughes me off becuase he knows I am just kidding.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marlos' skin heated with a fury that had no place in her heart. What was Aliena doing flirting with her Ranger! &quot;But I don't know how to flirt. I mean I am really no good at it, and don't even know where to start.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We all flirt Marlos!&quot; Aliena Laughed at her dear friend. &quot;You just don't realize you do it, and maybe that's your problem.&quot; Aliena considered Marlos with a raised eye brow. &quot;I don't know what to tell you, except that if he really means something to you, don't give up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marlos sighed, clearly disappointed. She had hoped Aliena would know some secret for making a male notice her. Apparently, there wasno secrets, or if there were, Aliena wasn't sharing. <br>
Marlos squinted at Aliena trying to make out if she was hiding something... 'This is dumb.' Marlos admitted to herself. &quot;Do you think I should be more forward, I mean what if he takes it the wrong way. I want him to notice me, but I don't want him to think I am offering something I am not.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just be yourself Marlos.&quot; Darue spoke up from the side. Marlos had all but forgotten him as she and Aliena spoke of her failed attempts to capture the attentions of her Ranger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Men&quot;, Marlos grunted to herself. If they how dare they do what they do and then expect her to pertend that everything was normal. &quot;It's not that easy, Darue.&quot; Marlos said dismissing the interruption.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually Marlos, some times that works. Be forward, but be yourself. Maybe you might want to try being honest with him.&quot; Aliena voiced in support of Darue's offered advice, then added in a whisper, &quot;I would never try the honesty thing with men, but hey! it could work.&quot; Laughing Aliena turned her attentions back to Darue leaving Marlos to drown in her own confused dispair.  <p>Lady Marlos Battleborne

Marlos didn't look up, making her way quickly to her chambers.  She couldn't bare to look upon her friend's faces, not now- never again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vanguardians!, gather to me!&quot; the summons rang through the hall, and Marlos knew she had to go, or all would be insulted by her absence.<br>
How could she go?  After the unholy bargain she made to save her own life.  She had to leave- She had to flee her own failures.  She couldn't stay any longer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Marlos?&quot;  Malceor's voice called into her chambers.  Blessed Malceor with his boyish innocence, tear streamed down Marlos' face.  &quot;Come on you silly elf, the council has been called, we must go.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's over, my dear ranger.  It's all over.&quot;  Marlos' voice trembled as she spoke, her bardic range failing her in shrilling sobs.<br>
&quot;What's happened?  Marlos! What's over?&quot; panic seeped into Malceor's voice as he watched Marlos break down.  &quot;Tell me dear bard, please tell me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marlos Told:<br>
<br>
The city of Neriak holds awe and horrible wonders for any bard, but for a wood elf, to see the results of Innoruuk's Hatred was an alluring horror indeed. <br>
Marlos wandered the alleys of the dark city once more drawing resolve from the horrors her eyes touched.  Elves should never be what these have been made.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are known as Marlos!&quot;  a voice came out of the darkness behind her, and as she turned toaddress it, &quot;You will come with us!&quot;  The Dragoons were upon her, but with no weapons bared, she would not try to flee.  But then, she could not have fled if she had tried, with the bad Resonance in the underground city.<br>
<br>
Passing through the Neriak Commons, the Dragoons lead Marlos deep into Neriaks 3rd Gate past the Temple of Innoruuk to the Library.<br>
<br>
As they entered the room, a scribe of Innoruuk looked up from his ledger.  Hardly an intimadating elf, this scribe held all the authority over the city's commerce and the payroll for the guards.<br>
&quot;Ah, Marlos.  I am so glad you could join me today.&quot; a wicked smile held frozen on the scribe's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had not any choice, and you had no right to have be brought.&quot;  Marlos return sadistic smile for sadistic smile with this elf.  She was a dark elf, she had to play the dark elf.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have all the right I need.  You are known as Marlos, and I know that name.  Marlos Battleborne of the Vanguard of the Iron Crown.&quot;  His smile never wavered as Marlos' heart froze in her chest.  &quot;I see you know that name as well, dear Lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
Screams rang through Neriak, but that was not uncommon.  What day in the centuries did Neriak ever know a time with no screams.<br>
Torturing the wood elf, the scribe showed no more care than he had over his ledgers, and no less skill.  Days crawled by, centuries by Marlos' measure of pain, but truly only days.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am satisfied with your songs bardess.&quot;  there was no sacrasm in the scribes eyes, but then the Teir'dal would call screams music.  &quot;and you do not prove worth killing.&quot;<br>
<br>
A shattered form of an elf cowered in the corner of the chambers.  She had a name once, if she could just think of it.  She was not insane yet, she would not be insane yet, she would not be insane yet.  She could feel the spiders crawling over her, and the scorpions stinging her.  &quot;They aren't real&quot;  she mumbled to herself.  The couldn't be real, or she would be able to get tem off.  They couldn't be real...<br>
<br>
&quot;It seems that Neriak has never had a bard who was welcomed openly, and since I don't believe you are a threat to this great city, I will grant you leave.&quot;  the scribe dipped his feather quill into the ink jar and penned a writ upon which he deftly scribed the word &quot;Marlos&quot;<br>
<br>
That's it, the heap of flesh quivered as she began to laugh.  &quot;Marlos!!&quot;  She called her name through the shatters ruins of her face.  &quot;I am Marlos Battleborne, Bard to the Warlord&quot; He had given her name back, this kind elf with the dark skin.  She had her name back.<br>
<br>
Smiling that unwavering smile at the ruined elf, the scribe answered in softly caressing tones, &quot;Yes you are.  You are Neriak's First Bard.  However, some will not welcome you so be sure not to go where you are not welcome.&quot;<br>
<br>
The spiders were gone, and the stings faded.  &quot;I am Marlos Battleborne, Neriak's First Bard.&quot;  The ragged wretch trembled as she repeated the scribe's words unhindered by doubt.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are welcome her as you are, dear Marlos.  No need for guises any longer.  You are the sole wood elf in Norrath welcomed here by the Guards.&quot;  Turning from the heap in the corner that had once been a Vanguard of the Iron Crown, &quot;Take her to Forest and leave her.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tears streamed down Marlos' face as she told the story, the details still buring her mind.  &quot;It's over.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;  Malceor comforted his beloved bard.  &quot;You are back with us now.&quot;  Marlos moved away from him as though he were an danger to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO, it's over.  It's all over.&quot;  Marlos packed her possessions in her pack and fled.  &quot;I am not what I have been, and I will not be what they want.  I am Marlos Battleborne, Bard to the Warlord!&quot; She growled to herself to cover the words that she ached to say, that burned her mind.  &quot;First Bard of Neriak&quot;<br>
