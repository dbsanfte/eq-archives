However, I'll just post it here.<br>
<br>
UI was attempting(I don't even know if we killed it. I had to go to bed. We were trying with a skeleton crew) to get back on the VS rotation tonight because we have new wizards that need the staff. We took ourselves out probably 3 months ago because we didn't have any wizards that needed the staff. Our old &quot;turn&quot; has been skipped at least once and probably twice. Now, we are just following the rules that have been in place for months...beat whoevers turn it is to VS and then join the rotation. Once we get the epic piece(s) we need we will drop out. If we ever need them again we will make sure we wait at least one rotation and get back in.<br>
<br>
I don't see how these actions caused so many people to send me tells. If UI would have dropped from the rotation and then just started killing VS whenever then I could see why. However, we skipped at least one turn probably two. I thought it was pretty nice of us to drop out so that people could get a greater chance at loot they would use. It isn't fair to except us to never kill VS again when we have wizards that need the staff. I'm sure every guild on the server would do the same for their members.<br>
<br>
Hopefully the folks that messaged me understand what UI is doing. We are trying to get epic pieces without getting loot we don't need and still follow the rules that have evolved for killing VS. If you don't understand, I guess you can just get mad and flame on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Heck if thre is a guild in the VS rotation that doesn't need a staff but wants the loot, we would glady help during your turn if we could loot the staff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukhaelwizzie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>khaelwizzie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://keith.vaughan.home.mindspring.com/img/ball3.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 660<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/26/01 1:28:42 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.afflictionguild.com/media/users/Khael/Khaelepic.jpg height=150 width=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS and UI</span><hr size=1> Check dates Mackentil, wasn't 3 months, not even close. Check this <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=5998.topic&start=41&stop=60">thread</a>.. Fitzroy was keeping pretty good track and updating very often; the date he posted that you guys left the rotation was 8/2, IN THIS SAME MONTH, and considering how often he updated it must have been pretty close to that. By the way, the rotation cycle is well over a month for each cycle so it's been roughly half a rotation spawn since you guys dropped out.<br>
<br>
And you're right, you probably should've just posted this in Rants and Flames and named it: "The Death of the VS Rotation." I think we'll "drop out" and just KS when we want half a cycle later, that must be pretty damned convenient! Way to set an example :)<br>

<br>
I am NOT an officer of MC, but I payed attention pretty well as to what was going on.  Here is the jest of it and from what I understand was agreed upon.<br>
<br>
UI would take this one, and they did.  Wiz staff dropped, so, grats on that.<br>
<br>
Affliction would take next one.<br>
<br>
Mystic Coercion would take next one after Affliction.<br>
<br>
This keeps the order of the rotation and all parties, from what I understand, are happy.  So, no need to rant or flame about anything.  As I told Mackentil, I am trying to stay on the sidelines and observe, not do the yelling/discussing.<br>
<br>
I understand both MC/Affliction and UI perspectives on this, and they both make sense.  Both sides are right, so, I believe the officers did a wonderful job on coming to a decision to make everyone happy.<br>
<br>
Again, just my observations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualascariel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alascariel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/26/01 2:28:01 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS and UI</span><hr size=1> <br>
UI have been out of the rotation for less than a full cycle. This simply amounts to taking an extra VS because thy feel like it. Of course, UI KS other guilds all the time, then decide to to try and talk their way out of it.<br>

I was there on kelin and itchy, I watched koryo msg kaane on his screen.  It was dick, pure and simple.<br>
<br>
**and now the general adress**<br>
<br>
I dont know the details, but what it sounds like happened was that UI killed a VS &quot;out of rotation&quot; NOT, I repeat, it sounds like they did not rush past an already assembled group to gank the spawn.  If this is the case and the UI crew ran past an already assembled crew to kill the mob before they did, well then, shame on them, but so far no one has said anything to that effect and the only points of rant have been about UI stepping out of whatever turn they had.<br>
<br>
The reason I was so upset the pervious time, ohh, running about 2-3 months ago was when the magister crew ran past our already assembled group who was doing last minute buffs and medding to race us out to the spawn.  It was ghey and disrespectful and the responce or lack thereof I recived when I voiced my concerns over this blatant and casual disregard of respect of other guilds was one of the several factors which led to my overall disgust with the higher-end game.  <br>
<br>
I will say again, IF (take careful note of the *IF*, this is indicative of me not knowing the facts of this snafu) the UI crew saw that VS was up, and moved past an already assembled group to kill him, then shame on them, they're an embarassment to my fond memories of UI.   <br>
<br>
However, IF (again, note the *IF*)they did not bumrush an assembled group, and simply saw that VS was up, assembled thier own force and killed him, then mayhaps people should move faster to kill him if they want him.  Or maybe (note the usage of maybe, this is a close relative of IF) they did skip a turn or a rotation or whatever the hell VS's time-share killings are parceled into nowadays.  I'm sure it's not the end of the world.<br>
<br>
People jump spawns all the time, every guild does, sometimes maliciously, sometimes accidentally, and sometimes unknowingly.  Having been removed from all this crap for a short while it's actually easy to remember all the good an bad things I've done in EQ, either intentionally or accidentally, the times I blew up without knowing all the facts or sworn vengance upon this guild or that because of the actions of one person acting in what they concived at the time were in the best interests of thier guild.  I know it's kind of a moot point, but before anyone starts criticizing anyone else, get input from people there, find out facts from fiction, it makes for less headaches.<br>

I'm sure UI didn't remove themselves on 8/2 exactly, but give or take a few days it doesn't really matter, does it?<br>

Why does UI persist in it's &quot;bad boy&quot; image?<br>

UI did not gank VS unknowingly. They were told several times by members of Affliction including an officer that it was not their turn.<br>
<br>
The reason for the rotation is to specifically allow each guild 24 hours to kill VS. VS had been up less than an hour when he was killed. The rest of the server chooses to respect the rotation, and to solve problems with the guilds involved.<br>
<br>
UI choose not too. So be it, the rest of the server is under no compunction to respect UI.<br>
<br>
There is no room for debate on this one. UI have not been out of the rotation even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rotation cycle. They were made aware that it was not their VS. They killed him anyway. <p><B>Alascariel Etien</B><BR>

I see no UI in that either.. I'd find more but it's just to damn early in the morning.<br>
<br>
Hrm, how could we end our spot on rotation on 8/2/01 as Cerulean said, when United Independent wasn't even in the rotation at the time?  It was also said on some previous post way back when, that to get into Venril Sathir's rotation of guilds, you have to &quot;kill steal&quot; your way in.  So if you want to be hipocritical and go against your own rules, that doesn't shine upon yourself to well.  United Independent did nothing wrong; people just want to give United Independent and people associated with United Independent a bad name, and a bad reputation.  <br>

I am too lazy to go look that up. But I know it was close to 3 months ago.<br>
<br>
I told Fitzroy at the end of July we were out of the rotation when our turn was coming up because Magister was trying to swap with us. I told Magister (Ailyea)(sp?)that we were out and we couldn't switch with them. I think PC ended up switching with them. <br>
<br>
You need to get the facts straight before you guys post. Look up that 200+ post thread on Magister jumping in front of us. Three days later is the date we last killed VS.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I got unlazy and looked it up. Our last turn was 6/17 but we didn't get to kill it until 6/20. Not quite close to three months but close enough. The point is we waited more than one cycle maybe two. <br>
<br>
You add the month and some change for the cycle to repeat and you get near end of July which is when I told Fitzroy we were out. Others that already posted in this thread have  shown our name doesn't appear on the rotation around the end of July. This shows as I have already stated that UI skipped at least one cycle and maybe two. <br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
I wish people would know what they were talking about before they posted.<br>
<br>
Oh here is the link showing when our last kill was. <br>

UI has done absolutely nothing wrong. We didn't pull over anyone. We didn't get any &quot;extra&quot; VS kills. We are just following the same rules that others follow. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umackentildapuller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mackentil Dapuller</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://members.theglobe.com/Zackulle/10PIXEL.JPG BORDER=0> at: 8/26/01 7:36:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umorphiusthejeweller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorphiusTheJeweller</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/26/01 7:31:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS and UI</span><hr size=1> UI did skip a complete round in the rotation.<br>
<br>
They have not been out of rotation for 3 months, it has just been 3 months since their last VS kill.  They got their kill after the magister &quot;fiasco&quot;.  UI took some heat on boards for selling the VS staff that dropped.  It was getting close to their next turn at VS when Fitzroy was contacted by member of UI and told they were dropping out of VS rotation (that was some time in July, but I don't know exact date).   The next guild in the rotation moved up, and life was good (made it quicker for my guilds next shot).<br>
<br>
So, UI didn't take a VS in that round of the rotation.  The rotation spun all the way around, and started anew.  According to the way the rotation works, if you are not in rotation (and UI had been out for a full turn), you get in by getting to VS before the guild who is up.  It appears that UI did this and is back in rotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2028<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/26/01 7:36:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Parum<br>

And Also...um...How was it not our &quot;turn&quot; when we dont have a &quot;turn&quot; to begin with, and trust me, Morphious is correct, it has not been a full rotation since we dropped out, but only since we killed him, which is all that counts isnt it? <br>
<br>
And Chuk, you still miss the point, but I'll let you figure that one out for yourself.

Our side was we got there first, started setting up. a few UI had shown up tried to set up before we did they couldnt do so. We pulled VS , UI tried to steal the pull , ended up dead becuase of their low numbers and unpreparedness and we get VS.<br>
<br>
See how different a side of the story that is? <br>
<br>
Whether you kill VS or not, if you are on that rotation turn, you are on that rotation.<br>
Its your option if you decide to kill him, but until you are officially out you are considered in.<br>
You were officially in until 8/2.<br>
<br>
From what i can tell Affliction has that turn and you moved ahead and took VS anyway even with their protests. <br>
If you wanna call yourselves saints and pat yourselves on the back on how fair you are , fine just dont say you had any right to kill that VS becuase you didnt and you skipped a cycle.<br>
<br>
Somebody posted earlier that this thread should be called "the death of the VS rotation" instead.<br>
<br>
I concur. how many other guilds are going to leave the rotation just so they can jump back in a few weeks later in an attempt to "retake the spot"<br>
Hehe nice loophole.<br>

<br>
So now tell me. Who is the official keeper of VS? Where do you send you official notice to withdraw from the rotation? Our guild decided right after we killed VS we were done. It was too much of a headache to fool with something we didn't need. I wasn't aware that you had to make an official withdrawl notice. Were you?<br>
<br>
It is funny how you will grasp at straws to continue the argument. I also like how you are trying to revive the old Magister vs UI argument. Who gives a crap. That happened months ago.<br>
<br>
We waited the appropriate amout of time. We haven't taken any extra VS spawns. We did just like any guild out of the rotation. You just want to argue for arguments sake.<br>
<br>
I find it ironic that the folks saying that this is the end of the VS rotation are the ones that will benefit the most to its end. Half the guilds in the rotation only want the epic pieces. If the VS rotation is declared FFA, then the top guilds will dominate the VS spawn until they have all their epic pieces and the smaller guilds will suffer. Don't use this incident to try to say UI is killing the rotation. We aren't. If we were, we would go kill the next VS spawn instead of waiting the 6 weeks to kill him again. Jeez. Give me a break. People take this game so seriously they can't logically think.<br>

<br>
anyways, If you have wizzies who need the staff why don't you try talking to other guildes and see if they are willing to help your wizard's out, instead of jumping infront and saying F-U we're here in his room and your at the zone.<br>
