I know they've donated money and what not since the attack, but their actions don't exactly make me swim with confidence in Starbucks.<br>
<br>
Call me silly, but I think I'm going back to Gevalia, even if I do have to make it myself.  Hell, I'll drink mcdonalds mud before I'll fork over for another over-priced cup of coffee (even if it's good.)<br>

This is utterly disappointing, but unfortunately I was waiting for a story like this to come to light.  I'm just glad the OPEC countries havn't decided that September 11th has given them more leverage and oil prices havn't shot up, a possibility I still think is real. Then what do we do? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
BUT.<br>
<br>
The worker was probably a minimum wage type, not empowered to make decisions like giving away $100+ in merchandise.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just a hard core capitalist type, but blaming a company for not *giving* away 'stuff' seems a bit out of whack to me.  They aren't a charity organization after all.  If, however, they jacked up the price of the water, based on the blatantly fubar situation, while it was still their right, but I'll also think twice before spending more money at their establishment (as is my right as an informed consumer).<br>

PS.  Gladtree, we'd probably 1) cut down on 'optional' gas purchases, 2) seek alternative means of transportation/energy, 3) suck it up and pay the cash, 4) continue 1-3 until such time as a member of OPEC decided *they* needed more cash, and started undercutting their buddies, or some other event restored the medium back to what we consider more 'normal'. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1657<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/3/01 1:32:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Personally, I'd have risked my job under the circumstances and given them the water.

<br>
The issue is the failure of starbucks to rectify the situation until it became widely known.  I'll reiterate something the article points out, a company's reputation should not be based on things that go wrong, but on their actions once the wrong is identified.<br>
<br>
They dropped the ball.  <br>
<br>
The question that remains to me, is what if they hadn't had the $130.00 dollars to pay for the water on them?  What a tremendous shame that would have been. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.taloncomics.com/Cao.JPG"><BR>

<br>
I guess we'll just have a difference of opinion on this one, because I still fail to see Starbucks, the corporation, as doing wrong in this situation.  For me, this situation, like many others, goes back to one statement:<br>
<br>
Under no circumstances (even as horrific as the WTC bombing), can one man's need justify a claim on another man's (or entity's) ability (including money, resources, etc.).<br>
<br>
While I, like most people in this country, would have given the worker the water, that is a decision I make for myself.  For me to say that a person or business must 'give' away their resources, regardless of cause, would make me a communist.<br>
<br>
Did they make a bad business decision by not rectifying the situation immediately?  Probably.  But it was well within their moral rights to charge for the water IMHO.  If consumers want to penalize them for not giving away water, that is their right, but I really do think folks should think about the statement above first...<br>
<br>
Not to anyone in particular,<br>
If anyone has a problem understanding the implications of what happens when one man's need IS allowed to present a claim on another man, think slavery, it's really that simple.<br>
<br>
Gar<br>
<br>
PS.  Back to Cao, hehe, if they hadn't had the money, they probably would have gone to another establishment that wouldn't have charged them.  When people need something badly enough, they find a way to get it, in my experience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 313<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 9:42:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> The Starbucks' lackey made a bad decision.

<br>
When Starbucks Customer Service was contacted, they clearly thought the story sounded so incredibly dumb, that they didn't believe it.  Again, front line customer service folks don't have a lot of authority, and aren't used to making such decisions.  <br>
<br>
My wife used to manage a customer service department for a mega-bank, and the folks that answer the phone usually can't find their ass with both hands.  That's why I always ask for a supervisor.  Usually you won't really get one, but at least you are more likely to get one of the sharper folks on the floor or get your request moved up in the cue.<br>
<br>
Starbucks made a big mistake.  Well, two of their dimmer employees did.

<br>
If it didn't work that way, companies would never bother to fix their mistakes, why bother, there's no repercussions.<br>
<br>
Case in point:<br>
<br>
I have not purchased Exxon/Mobil (now mobil too since the merge), based on their refusal to pay the clean up costs for their screw up with the Valdez.  That, in my opinion, showed an incredible lack of what I consider community concern.  You can rate your companies on whatever criteria you choose to, but I include &quot;community issues&quot; in how I rate a company.  <br>
<br>
I recently changed my Exxon opinion, when they were the ONLY gas station in town to not raise prices in the confusion following the attack.  Based on that, I gave them some credit they never had previously.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, I can and will withhold my business from Starbucks.  <br>
<br>
I've written them a letter, they know how I feel.  It may make a difference on how their employees are trained in the future.  I may not buy Starbucks for a month or a year, however long I feel, but take it from me, the starbucks guys locally WILL know I'm not there.  I buy that much coffee.<br>

The Starbucks situation is quite different.  Lower level peons made poor decisions which they were never trained to address.  The cashier was clearly in over his head and afraid for his job if he gave away over $100 in product.  The CS rep was just stupid.

<br>
Journalists *CALLED* starbucks about the situation and were ignored.  It was not until massive amounts of media and email targetted the actions of the company that they decided to fix it.<br>
<br>
What I dislike about their actions is this:<br>
<br>
It should have been corrected because they felt the wrong action had been taken rather than a media blitz forcing them to take action and correct it for fear of &quot;not looking good&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't blame the action of the cashier, re-read my posts.  He did what he thought he had to do, it's not what I would have done, but he made a choice, based on how he perceived his company would want him to act.<br>
<br>
I work in a company that has a huge customer service base.  In fact, I provide the training and the knowledge that they take to the lines with them.  Take it from me, everyone who leaves my class after knows damn well if they told someone &quot;that would never happen&quot; and dismissing a complaint would find themselves jobless in a minute.<br>
<br>
But, even dismissing the actions of the cashier, and forgiving the stupidity of the CS rep, the fact remains that other folks went straight to the PR dept and the president and didn't get a response til news reports were actually published.  <br>
<br>
Shame, Starbucks could have resolved this much earlier than they did, they chose not to until it had the potential to make them look bad.<br>

I guess it's all a matter of perspective on this one.  The letter to the President perhaps hadn't reached him by the time the media did.  The story doesn't say.  In fact, the story has nothing from Starbucks in it.  Unlikely that the story was known by management and swept under the carpet.  Calls from reporters frequently go unanswered.  I know I counsel my clients never to speak to the press, for it usually only ends up resulting in misquotations or misstatement.  Despite your other feelings toward Starbucks, they've been pretty good at marketting and PR, so I doubt very much that they knew the facts and chose to ignore it.<br>

Since then, it's been all down hill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaoilfhionn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caoilfhionn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Erotic, exotic & a little psychotic</span><br>  Posts: 549<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/8/01 12:26:00 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.altdzin.com/tgl/cao.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well</span><hr size=1> I gave in to the evil temptation of a Tazoberry today =(<br>

If coffee needs almond or vanilla flavoring to make it tasty then it ain't coffee.<br>

I personally drink coffee black 80%  of the time.  I add a little cream occasionally and on weekend mornings I'll add a little Bailey's or the occasional evening Irish Coffee.<br>

I like their &quot;Fa-la-la-la-latte&quot; around Christmas.  Egg Nog flavored coffee is quite tasty.  Their coffee doesn't NEED the flavoring, although it's good sometimes with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=194.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showMessage?topicID=216.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.emailToFriend?topicID=209.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.threadControl?topicID=209.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=209.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=209.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
