<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>Only a reasoned and rational argument has even a chance of making an impact.<hr></blockquote>Would this be the same chance an enchanter has of winning a Cloak of Flames in a Nagafen raid? &nbsp;Yes, it happens, but it's always a really strange situation.<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>Only a reasoned and structured responce<br>
will get my attention.<hr></blockquote>Going back through your numerous posts from this week, I find it odd that you'd insist on having structured responses. &nbsp;Let's take a few random cullings from the "structure" you use in your messages:<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>I dont attack innocent people<br>
so please go away.<br>
<br>
[<i>Yet you also said, "I will post whenever I want on any topic I want." &nbsp;You do realize that you are rather maliciously attacking their friends and guildmates, right? &nbsp;You can post, then so can they. &nbsp;Don't expect them to be <u>ever</u> so grateful just because your previous comments toward them have been taken back.</i>]<hr size=1>Because she feared the ramifications<br>
of grouping with me.<br>
<br>
[<i>There is structure in fragments. &nbsp;It's just very, very poor.</i>]<hr size=1>As for Justicia, I have only one question and it is a simple one and I really<br>
dont know the answer because I dont play seconds and I know exactly 2 things about clerical gear.<br>
<br>
[<i>Hello run-on sentence. &nbsp;You've apparently spent so much of your brainpower on searching through dictionaries for words most people don't use on a daily basis. &nbsp;It seems you've left no room in there for successful complex and compound sentences. &nbsp;It's no wonder you're always talking in shorts. &nbsp;When you mistook Nuldar for Kerrol, you went as far as saying the text you read had poor punctuation. &nbsp;Do you even know why the punctuation was the way it was? &nbsp;Four words: &nbsp;Internet Relay Chat Log</i>]<hr size=1>I certainly so.<br>
<br>
[<i>Well, I guess short sentences still aren't your forte, are they?</i>]<hr size=1>You want to misrepresnt a metaphor expoused to make a point on a e-forum<br>
you denigrate your implied field of study.<br>
<br>
[<i>Put the dictionary down. &nbsp;Having words defined for you does nothing if you're still going to misspell them when they're right in front of you. &nbsp;You don't need a dictionary, or even a thesaurus. &nbsp;You need a writing class.</i>]<hr></blockquote><br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>yes your right I dont read carefully. That was obvious a long time ago.<hr></blockquote>If you admit this, then why do you expect people to  bother showing you the courtesy of whatever it is you consider a "reasonable, rational, and structured" comment?<br>
<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Chiteng</b> wrote:</i><hr>No I am NOT carefull. That would mean that I cared.<hr></blockquote>If you don't care, then go away. &nbsp;See, the thing here is, you do care. &nbsp;You've been obsessed with this Da`Kor thing for years. &nbsp;Forget the writing class I mentioned. &nbsp;You need a comprehension class to understand the words that are not only coming from other people, but from yourself, too.<br>
<br>
Picking on posting styles may be a bit low, but you know what? &nbsp;Your posting style is one of the most annoying things in your messages, next to your obsessiveness and unwillingness to understand reason.<br>
<br>
No haiku from me.<br>
I have ceased and desisted.<br>

I sat there and answered questions for three hours, not just from Mitch but from everyone there. They told me their resists, what they planned on wielding, what spells they thought they should cast and I gave them advice as if this was my raid and I wanted to see a dead dragon. I know they didn’t defeat Lady Vox that day(they even got trained by a Guide, dunno if they knew that), but I know they learned a hell of a lot… most importantly, get a map. ''<br>

I remember it like it was yesterday Ven.  Was indeed my first time pulling Vox and your advice was very helpful, the bit about getting a 'map' particualrly made me go DOH at the time :)<br>

<br>
i suppose it would be rediculous for me to tell you to pay attention after reading your reply to that one...<br>
<br>
the irony is that what i said in sarcasm, you answered in truth...and the answer validated what i never intended to be taken seriously.<br>
<br>
i'm not quite sure how to take that.<br>
<br>
on to other things:<br>
<br>
vendrix may not have been in the chat room when dakor was formed (i don't think) and onyyn may not have been either, but they are definitely more old school guildmembers than me.  i understand that you might mean &quot;honorary&quot; in that rannd was a founder and i've been there from the beginning, but no, i wasn't a member, nor did i want to be until i could gain entry on my own merit...not just as rannd's girlfriend.  that's why i never let oggie invite me, but accepted when leiran did.  but that's a long story.<br>
<br>
they were there from VERY early, definitely helped shape the guild as much as you claim tzzird and teuvas did, possibly more as they were MUCH more vocal and pushy.  in the time i spent with that guild, i never witnessed the two t's really make driving pushes for anything, i'm still trying to figure out what you mean when you keep saying that the guild allowed them to guide it and make decisions for it.  they were two of the more quiet, just here to play the game type attitudes.  not even quite sure where you got that idea from in the first place, i just always figured you had a reason...but after all the stuff i've read you reply to me here, i think maybe you don't.  you just don't like them, knew the guild they were in, so made that up on your own.<br>
<br>
yeah, they are my friends, but that doesnt' mean i think they are perfect.  i always gave you the benefit of the doubt that you knew something i didn't...now i'm forced to question that too.  i believe you when you say tzzird did what he did to you, but i think you've let your imagination run wild concerning the rest of it. i have seen no proof of your words, and have seen false information being handed out by you on so many other matters, it's getting tough...even for those here as open minded as myself.<br>
<br>
my end point still remains the same though, and i see you ignored it.  everything you are saying is the same thing over and over again, everything dakor is saying is the same thing over and over again.  that means, it's been said out and it's time to be silent.  <br>
<br>
still in shock that you actually validated what i said...that's just awful.<br>

Need my address?  Please, send the authorities my way.  I dunno that I get a kick outta swattin flies, but I have to admit sometimes I get a rush.  It's almost sexual.<br>

<br>
It's disservice, first.  Beyond that, I don't do a disservice to anything.  You are trying to compare one thing that has NOTHING to do with the other.  You can't compare potential cheating in a game to murder.  Espouse all you want, I don't believe it, and neither does anyone else.  Again, I say, NOTHING you say can convince me that the ripped up, torn up guy I saw last week compares to some guy  who cheated in a game.  There's absolutely NO comparision at all.<br>

Well, obviously you do, or you wouldn't be bitching about shit that happened two years ago.  You'd have let it go in your little black and white world.  Evil (nukin shit thru a wall) does not equal Evil (burying men in my backyard).  If I start murdering men (and trust me, they wouldn't be buried in the backyard, they'd be random peeps I picked up hitchihiking with no connection to me, but I digress), it won't compare to if I somehow do something shady in a game.  IT'S A FUCKING GAME.  <br>

<br>
I personally love to hear men scream my name.  It's a rush.  I can't necessarily say they are in pain at that point, as I've never been in that absolute position.  Why are we on corpse camping anyway now.  Has DK gone from cheating &amp; monopolizing zones to corpse camping?<br>

Try evolving with the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
I find it very ironic that in a post of yours a month or so back you comparred yourself to Martin Luther King.<br>
<br>
But there is no way to argue with someone who has your point of views (i.e. everything is black and white)  The best we can do is try to convice you that you are wrong to think that way (Yes, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> wrong</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->).<br>
<br>
What is really wrong about it is you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> know</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> how you view things.  This isn't the same as someone catagorizing people because it's all they ever knew, or how they were brought up, they don't realize what they are doing.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand know exactly what you doing and how you view people.  That is very sad.<br>
<br>
Seriously, wake up.  That is no way to treat people.  What I am saying here nothing to do with the game, I really don't care about 95% of the things you say about the game; but what I do care about is how you catagorize things and always, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> look for the evil in everything.  <br>
<br>
I guess if you had a son and he stole $10 from your wallet you would call the police and have him arrested, because you live in a black and white world.<br>
<br>
Hopefully when you think of incidents like that, you will realize that you are very misguided in your views.<br>
<br>
I can only hope you don't act the way in RL that you do on the boards.  I suggest you read all of your posts again and how people respond.  You will realize that most of everyone's replies to you have nothing to do with the game, it's about how you act.<br>
<br>
If there is one thing I could teach you it is to do this:<br>
<br>
Open your mind to the POSSIBILITY that you could be wrong.  Just consider it.  You don't need to believe it right away, infact make it your goal to disprove it.  But if you atleast CONSIDER it, you will learn a lot about yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushadowwize.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowWize</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 758<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/11/01 1:38:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: damn...</span><hr size=1> My reading comprehension level dropped from just reading this thread.
