Sentient suits are really only good for necro's or SK's. snare em fear em, and they get easy as hell to kill as long as you have some sort of mele damage doer.<br>
<br>
And on AoE groups, I love AoE, but normally whenever I seem to be looking, it's normally, enchie is grouped, other enchie is logging, other enchie is on raid, 4 other enchies afterwards are on raid, by then the rest of the groupies decide to log or go somewhere else P<br>
<br>
But I've been fortunate enough  to have been in a few AoE groups, and I loved them, but I wasn't able to get the numbers of people to do it again for awhile.<br>

<br>
Familiars won't have anything to do with wizards getting mana back faster, cause that's what Clarity does, and flowing thought, and we also have harvest, VI would never be so &quot;dumb&quot; enough to give wizards the upper edge over other classes. It may allow us to get crippling blows on spells, cause VI said they liked that idea, but it won't have anything to do with mana recovery hands down.<br>
<br>
Enchie's got mad enough when flowing thought was introduced, and FT is worse than breeze. A step up from manaskin so I heard. <br>
<br>
Lemme say this again, VI will not make mana recovery for wizards better than any other int class, cause we had to bitch our brains out just for harvest. They have vehemontly replied in class balancing boards that they WILL NOT ever make wizards mana regen better, and I think they'd spread that to wizard &quot;pets&quot; as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceruleanruneguard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CeruleanRuneguard</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/01 2:12:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard's new spell Summon Familiar</span><hr size=1> <br>
<br>
The level 60 familiar (as it stands now, which is WAY too early to predict anything) has a pretty hefty casting cost which, hopefully, would imply some nice benefits... but sadly our flaming sword has a high casting cost and it basically takes space up in our spellbook.<br>

<br>
From a rough guess, based on the various hints that have been dropped down I will will bet that the pets have very low hitpoints, don't do jack for mana, but provide an additional mana pool, and will reduce costs/increase damage of wizard spells based on the level of the familiar.  Will this be a defining line for thet wizard class if this is the case,  you bet.  Btw, for those wizards who complain about damage on your average SoV mob, think of it this way.  Take your average 300k hp mob.  Take 40 people on the average to kill it.  Most mobs debuffed can be hit by a non lure wiz spell, or db or giant bane.   A group of six rogues is very hard pressed to KS a group of 6 wizards on a SoV encounter.   So yes, do levels 50-59 suck for a wizard, yes, but you are compensated in the end game by really performing well at level 60.  Rogues pretty much blow chunks up till level 55, and they get rewarded 55+.  Necros/Enchanters/Druids/etc perform very well up till the late end game, but see their roles very heavily reduced in the end game.  <br>

Elnots, I'm sorry to say, but if you're ever in a normal exp group, and you overnuke, and you die because you sat there and whined for the tank to get it off of you, well, maybe you should just stick to kiting raps. <br>
<br>
Very rarely do I die in a exp group (not counting AoE groups... poorly constructed AoE group = diefest), because if I do plan on overnuking, it is only to finish off an annoying add that isn't dying, if, say, the enchie is lom. If you overnuke there are so many things you can do to reduce aggro. I don't even have Concussion and I fare perfectly well with Immobilize... unless, of course, you have Gate memmed instead of that =O When I'm in an exp group, the only buffs I have are Heroic Bond (group), symbol, and arch sheilding (and mr, of course :)). With those buffs, you have to do something really stupid, like IC right at the beginning of a fight, to die.<br>

Khael never said "an uber guild". If an uber guild is your box of chocolates, then go for it - but Khael never said "You will not enjoy being a wizard unless you are in UI, Affli, Magister, SF, or MS. Period." And if I recall, you've been in a large number of guilds in the past few months (CoH, CE, The League, and a few others). Guild-hopping isn't the way to prove yourself to an uber guild (common sense speaking there).<br>

More than just making the game require skill, it might make people wait around for eight hours for the respawn... if only half or three-fourths of a raid has the necessary keys to continue... how do you get the whole guild to the next isle?

/agree... However, when they haven't even had the spell on test for more than a few hours, and no one, short of VI employees, knows what it does, you could very well be "Bitching it Worse™". As it stands, this familiar could be extremely helpful. VI reads the boards... "OH SHIT! The wizards don't like it... stop the presses!" Here's an example that I think relates the issue:<br>
<br>
You recieve a letter that says that some woman is going to come over to your house and have sex with you, no strings attachted. Do you:<br>
<br>
A) Bitch because the woman might be ugly and/or diseased? (Thus having them send a more attractive woman)<br>
B) Bitch because you think the woman might be too hot and walk away? (Thus having them send aformentioned ugly woman)<br>
C) Wait until you *see* the woman and her reaction until you start bitching or undressing. <br>
(If you are female, replace *woman* with *man*)<br>
<br>
I hope you can see that option C is the best, and what wizards like Elnots are not doing right now. So I agree with what you said about *protesting* (acting like whiny, spoiled brats posting on whineplay will not get anything... act like adults, and you will definitely have better luck) before the spell goes live. But this is not the way to make VI change their minds. Not bitching and screaming like a eight year old who just discovered the vulgar side of the English language: "What in the braindead cat fuckin shit eatting pus nutted flat chested rat ass cow nippled hell was going on in the minds of Verant when they made this spell?!?!!(sic)" Elnots, that was neither funny, nor was it a battle cry to rise the wizards against VI, the Spite Machine™<br>

<br>
I forget who it was but someone was saying something about wizards having the edge in KS ability on one on one encounters. <br>

So that was what I was saying there, I hardly ever die in a group, and about the uber guild thing, I need to go back and check what khael said, but I am pretty sure he said something about sympathizing for wizards that weren't in &quot;larger&quot; guilds. I might have mistaken what he said from large meaning uber. My apologies.<br>

Except my girlfriend but thats none of your business and it rarely has no strings attached.<br>
<br>
But every other spell shown all over the net has an effect. A useful effect, even O'Keils. Summon familiar has been toted as a small pet which follows the master and does not attack. Now agreed it could be totally wrong but if I compare it to your analogy the question should really be.<br>
<br>
What would you do if a woman wrote to you saying she was going to come to your house and lie down on the bed doing absoloutley nothing?<br>
<br>
Do you <br>
<br>
a) complain and hope you get a woman who will do more then lie there.<br>
b) complain and tie said woman to the bed so she can't move anyway. <br>
c) wait to see if the woman just lies there before sticking your knob back in your trousers and going to play EverQuest.<br>
<br>
In the end I guess it's all a matter of a persons nature. And if Verant are watching this little thread they are<br>
<br>
<br>
a) thinking &quot;hey, that idea about giving wizards little friends to kep them company while they solo hasn't been taken well, lets change it&quot;<br>
b) thinking &quot;Heh...wizards are pissing and whining again..lets nerf em!&quot;<br>
c) thinking &quot;where the hell are these letters from the women who are writing to have sex with us&quot;<br>
<br>
Lets face it. Some whining is going to be taken as whining. Some whining is going to be taken as positive action. Some positive action is going to be taken as whining and a tiny smidgeon of positive action is going to be taken as positive action.<br>
<br>
And the non people who whine about whiners, whine even more when they do get nerfed or they dont get buffed in line with the other classes.<br>
