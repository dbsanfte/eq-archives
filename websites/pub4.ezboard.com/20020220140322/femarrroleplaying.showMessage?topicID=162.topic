The little Bard needed new stories to tell so he went to Kaladim and entered the Pub Kal, he stopped to let his eyes adjust to the dim light. Over in the corner he saw a huge pile of something, on closer inspection he saw it was a huge Barbarian sleeping. &quot;Sire&quot;? he said, nothing, &quot;Sire!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Huh? What? What do you want Bard? why do you wake me&quot;?<br>
The young bard told him of his need for a new story to tell.<br>
&quot;A story tis what you seek bard? Then Ale is what I need, to give me tongue juice to speak, so buy ale bard, buy ale&quot;.<br>
<br>
Me name is Gilelan Votan, and as you can tell my home is Halas, and I am a warrior of 29 circles. I shall start your story from the real begining of my life....long before I was born.  My father was a very old woodelf druid named Sham, I have 2 other siblings, Resham Sonofsham, a woodelf druid of 40 circles, and Shanie, a woodelf Ranger of 35 circles, these are my half brother and sister. When Shanie was born Sham's wife died in child birth and he gave her to the guild to be raised and left his city of birth and found his way to the lands surrounding Halas.<br>
<br>
There Sham met and fell in love with me mother Gilina Votan, after a steamy courtship they were wed, and I was made. But when I was born, I was of great size and she died having me. After the shock of this happening again Sham gave me to the Warrior guild to raise, and left Halas never to be seen again.<br>
<br>
I was beaten and used and forced to practice many long hours a day, learning the warrior ways. But learn them I did, and learned them well.<br>
<br>
One day a Druid came along and told me of other siblings that I had in the land of Greater Faydark, he said that he would be happy to take me there if i wished it.  And low and behold, before me eyes could blink I was at a ring of stones in a land called butcherblock mnts.<br>
<br>
I lived and fought there for the next 12 circle of my life, letting my axe taste the flesh of many an orc, and goblin.  Every once in a while, while there, I did get to see my brother and sister, how tiny they looked to my eyes the first time I saw them, for even though we have the same father I took all the genes of my mother. They told me what they knew of our father Sham, and I told them of what I knew of his life in my homeland.<br>
<br>
Resham left the Butcherblock Mnts. and headed to my home to learn more of our father Sham.  When he returned many circles later, he sat on a hill outside of the Castle Felwithe, bringing up skills and getting things for brewing whine.  One day a very beautiful High Elf Wizard named Nalama Layfe came along and asked him of his time and help, and Resham said he would help her. For he didnt do much any more waiting for his Beloved Ibrianna to return for the land of the humans. After spending time together Nalama started talking of her life and how lonely it was hunting and staying alive on Norrath alone. Upon hearing the sadness and lonliness in her voice, Resham told her of me, and how too I was alone in this world of little good and much evil.<br>
<br>
Resham came to me in the Oasis of Marr and took me back to the Castle Felwihe where I met for the first time the woman Nalama. Her beauty was like none I have ever seen, those eyes, those beautiful eyes. A tear runs down Gilelan's cheak. <br>
<br>
More ale bard, more ale!!<br>
<br>
My heart was taken on the spot by Nalama, I could not bare to be away from her.  We hunted together all the time, we would make our camps in the woods and talk the night through, and I was so happy just to be at her side.  We fought well together, we killed many a crazed goblin in the Butcherblock Mnts.  We both advanced many circles there.<br>
<br>
My love for Nalama grew and grew with each passing day, but I could not bring myself to ask for her hand in marriage.  For I did not think that a high elf the likes of her would have me for a husband.  <br>
<br>
One night while sitting alone by my fire in my camp for the night, my mind went back to my home land. My memories went back to the stories I heard as a child about the old ways of the Barbarian's.  Of the old Shaman magic of many hundreds of years ago, it was called &quot;Binding&quot;, this binding was not like the one that is used today. This binding was a binding of ones soul to another, so that the one being bound gave up his soul to the one being bound to.  For with out a soul there is no fear of death, it was used in the old days for making body gaurds.  With no fear of death the body gaurd would easliy give up his life for his leigh.<br>
<br>
One day I came across an old shaman and ask her if she knew of this magic, and she said she had heard of it but she did not know the magic of old. She did tell me that for one to be bound, the one wanting to give up his soul had to have the permission of his father. My heart broke, I told her of my fathers absence for all these years and that he was probably dead. She then told me that the only other that could give me to this binding was the first born son. &quot;Resham! I yelled.&quot;  &quot;You dont have to yell young one&quot; she scolded me.  Sorry M'Lady, I beg your forgiveness, for Resham is the first born of my family.  &quot;Then his permission you will have to have&quot; she said, &quot;but first you will have to find one that knows the magic&quot;. Where M'Lady would I start to find one that knows of the old ways, where?  &quot;If I were you young Barbarian I would start in the Shaman Guild in your home city of Halas.&quot;<br>
<br>
I left word in the druid guild for Resham that I needed his help bad, and one day he found me hunting the Crazed Goblins with my beloved Nalama. I told of my wish to be bound to her and would he give help to me by giving his permission.  He thought long and hard on the matter..and watched how Nalama looked at me and he could see my love for her.  Resham said he would give it and that he would search for a Shaman with the knowledge of the old magic for me.<br>
<br>
Resham was gone many turns of the moon before he came back to Butcherblock to find me.  He told me that he search and search for a Shaman with the knowledge of the old magic and finally he found one.  He told me to pack a light bag and he would take me to Halas to see the old Shaman.  I told him I had every thing I needed on me, and with a wave of his hand and a flash of colors I was in Surefall Glade and we ran to my home in Halas.  <br>
<br>
I talked to the old Shaman lady and told her of my need and my wish, she told me &quot;young one, do you know of the danger of your wish?&quot;  I told her that indeed I did not.  She then told me that if for any reason the Lady Nalama was to break the bound with my soul then I would die. That once this was done...it can not be undone.  I told the old Shaman that I would accept those rules, for to live with out her would not be living, and I might as well be dead.<br>
<br>
She told us to sit for it would take a while, and she disapeared behind the curtain that hung between the rooms.  It seemed like a long time, but finally she returned with an old dusty book and a bottle with purple fluid in it.   She sat down with us and opened the old book and look back and forth through the pages till she found the one she wanted.  Again she asked me if this is realy what I wanted, and I told her it was.  <br>
<br>
Strange chants started to come from her mouth and she told me to drink the fluid from the bottle.  I put it to my mouth and my nose smelled the foul oder coming from it, I turned it up and swallowed as fast as I could, but still the taste, oh the taste, it was so bad.  I sat there and looked at the colors coming from her hands and I then felt a deep burning in my chest, and I screamed in pain and grabbed my chest.  The next thing I remember was waking up in a cot in the cornor of the old Shaman's room, with her sitting beside me.  &quot;Ah young one, your awake.....tis been 3 days you have been gone.  But you live, and now your soul is in the lady Nalama. What ever she tells you to do you will do, you will do what ever it takes to keep her alive.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I then left Halas and returned to the land of Nalama, and i found her in her city of Felwithe.  I told her what I had done and what it meant.  &quot;What did you do!&quot; she said &quot;why?&quot;  &quot;Because I love you so much, and I never what harm to come to you&quot; I said.  It was then she told me words that I thought I would never hear from her, she told me that she loved me so very much.  She reached up and held my face in her tiny hands, &quot;you big lovable lug, you would do this for me?&quot;  &quot;Ah M'Lady, I am not scared now, I am at peace.&quot;  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;And now young Bard, for the end of your story.  The Lady Nalama and I were wed in the city of Felwithe by a guide of our world.&quot;<br>
