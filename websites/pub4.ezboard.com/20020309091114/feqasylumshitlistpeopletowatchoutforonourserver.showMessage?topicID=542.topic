A ranger. calael is killing it&quot;  Q@uillmane is a mage epic mob. And knowing mages were on the way Calael a 54 + ranger , who has his epics I might add. attacks and kills an epic mob for mage class.

I just had it out with you for 45 minutes in ooc in SK and here you are bitching again.<br><br>I was *at* quillmane. I followed him around for many minutes watching him blithefully wander. As I did, I did a /who all for zeipher (is that his name?)who had been repeatedly in zone camping it, and then for any mages I knew that didn't have their epic. I do this regularly, just hang out in SK and skill up my lowbie alts and help the poor mages who have a truly SHITTY camp for their epic. (/cheer slimer. /cheer qalas.) Finally, a druid ran up (unsurprising. I came across Quill by luck, he has track :P) so I just shouted in /ooc &quot;Quill is up, any mages need&quot; and prepared to kill my munkie in dragging Quill to a mage so they wouldn't lose it to a druid looking for a lev they can already cast.<br><br>The druid informed me that someone was on their way, about 5 more mages all appeared from Merlinda to you, asking where Quill was. It was at that moment Calael appeared, killed it, looted it, thanked me on behalf of a mage I will not name here who he is going to multiquest with to do her epic.<br><br>You then spent the next fucking HOUR in ooc trying to <br><br>a) Claim that he had KSed you because you had called the mob while in lavastorm<br><br>b) you were petitioning him for ksing your mob and generally insulting him (although he'd already zoned, you went on for a good hour)<br><br>c) You were told no one wanted it so you came running and that gave you ever right to it, see A)<br><br>d) that somehow, some fucked up way, you truly believed that you were more entitled than Merlina (who, btw, had about 900 thousand times more grace than you and said a bit of &quot;VI sucks, congrats mage who gets it&quot; before logging) or any other mage who wants that damn horse.<br><br>Let me give you a clue I tried to give you in /ooc tonight. You were not at Quillmane. I WAS. No one had attacked it. Calael got there first. Even IF he looted the cloak just to have a free lev, he was totally in his rights to do so, but I seriously doubt that a ranger hanging on to his epic weapons is going to be that petty, and I am pleased as punch that the cloak is going to a mage that needs it. /cheer Calael.<br><br>YOU, on the other hand, have put yourself up as a prime example of the worst case of selfish, immature, spoiled goddamn brat syndrome I have EVER had the displeasure to have ever encountered in the game. Listening to you go on and on in OOC tonight, and then finding this post was unbelievable. Even *I* with my low opinion of you after your behavior tonight didn't think you'd be stupid enough to try the shitlist.<br><br>Guess what, honey? Your name is now where it belongs, on the shit list, at least until the moderators delete this, and rightfully so.  <p><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/rugensig.jpg"><br><embed src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/swallowsoul.wav" autostart=false loop=false height=18 width=144 controls="console"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/01 1:40:17 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwicon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calael</span><hr size=1> I feel bad for you not getting an epic piece, but like said above "he engaged it first".

Calael it seems did the exact same thing as I would have done had I seen it, and I see absolutely no wrong in it. If you needed the cloak that bad, have someone kill the thing and multiquest with you. Or better yet, demonstrate your desire to get it by being in SK looking for the horse yourself, rather than in Lavastorm complaining that someone who *was* there got to it first. Also, after calling Rugen a moron you're pretty much passed verdict upon yourself in my eyes... but I guess you don't care. After all, I am just another ranger who would have KSed a mob in SK from you while you were in Lavastorm not camping it... Finally, i've known Calael from way back (we first met in Crushbone, hoping to get one of those elusive dragoon dirks, an incredible weapon in its time), though it has been a *long* time since we last met, and I can tell you this: He's honorable.<br><br>PS.

Not super well but well enough to believe that he said he was going to multi the cloak if he said he was.<br><br>Also, i have met this mage before.. Aaini.<br><br>The last time i met her she was a whiny brat, and i see nothing has changed.<br><br>You have no rights to anything.  There is no KS, this is not even close.  The quillmane cloak is USUALLY multiquested in this quest.  Whether the person was there or not is irrelevant.  They obviously have friends who are close enough to them to want to help them in this manner.<br><br>If you wernt such a whiny person, mabye you would have friends who were able to do this stuff to help YOU too.<br><br>Yes, I understand epic frustration... that in NO way shape or form excuses you from your behaviour in that log.  If you had some class you would understand that.<br><br>At least merlina, who i am sure is just as frustrated as you were, showed true class. I hope she gets her cloak soon. <p><a href="http://www.mithrilweb.com//"target="web"><img src="http://www.mithrilweb.com/images/sigs/llosig.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=542.topic&start=21&stop=32>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showPrevMessage?topicID=542.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showNextMessage?topicID=542.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.emailToFriend?topicID=542.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.threadControl?topicID=542.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=542.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=542.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
