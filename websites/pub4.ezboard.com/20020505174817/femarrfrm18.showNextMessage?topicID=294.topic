If the US government said that it would no allow Cherokee Indians to move back to Appalachia because it undermines the White culture of the area, would that be considered racist?   <br><br>  Seems pretty hypocritical to me.  They are the ones fighting racism but are racists themselves?  These are people who used to live in Israel, not people who want to settle there.  IMO, the Western world needs to acknowledge that butchering the geography of Palestine in oder to create a purely Jewish nation was illegal.  They need to reconcile and learn to live together.  Their country is like the segregated society of the South in post-slavery times.  How is this not acknowledgable by the news media in America?  <br><br>  These Palestinian activists are not going anywhere.  Unlike their Jewish counterparts who, for the majority, left their 'homeland' for a more prosperous life in Europe, only to return a thousand years later.  And this makes sense?!?!<br><br>  My point is that America needs to learn how to be fair and not so biased.  We need to look out for America first.  People don't just hate America because they put a blindfold on, spun the globe in a circle and their finger of hatred landed on good ole' USA.  They hate us because we are Ignoring their cry's.  But whatever, people don't usually think for themselves, they listen to their teachers and TV as if it is Truth.  Its so much easier for others to think for us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/29/02 6:12:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> I believe that alot is overlooked when it comes to Israel's &quot;recapture&quot; of the land they now claim as theirs. I think the most vivid recollection is that of 1967 when Israel was declared a &quot;state&quot; by the U.N. However, there is much much more information in regards to this that can be historically backed up with more then &quot;God said it was ours so we took it back&quot;.... Its not like that.<br><br>In the jewish mind, this all goes back to 638 AD when Caliph Omar Ben Hatav takes Jerusalem placing it under Arab Muslim rule. The rest as they say is &quot;history&quot;. In 1099, after 200+ years of the spead of Islam throughout the Middle-East and much of Europe, the Christain Crusaders recapture Jerusalem. Now even though these Crusaders worshiped the same God as the Jews, it still didnt sit well with the Jewish people...they wanted their land back and not controled by the West.<br><br>In 1187 Saladin consolidates Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and most of Palestine, recaptures Jerusalem for the Muslims and drives out the Crusaders. Again, this is a failure for the Jews in the re-taking and re-staking of their land. It wasnt until some 43 years later that the Roman Emperor Fredrick II retakes Jerusalem.<br><br>In 1244, Muslims seize Jerusalem from the crusaders, all following crusades to recover Jerusalem fail until the Turkish empire retakes Jerusalem back in 1840. Now, in 1917 the Balfour Declaration liberates Palestine from Turkish rule placing it under control of Great Britain. Some 30 years later in 1947, the United Nations votes to end British control of Palestine dividing the country into a Jewish and Arab state. Since then there has been many attempts by Arab nations to retake the area now controled by the Jewish people but all had failed. Now here is where it gets tricky... In 1967, the six day war begins with Arab attack on Israel. Israel captures land three times the area of itself and gains full control over Jerusalem for the first time in 2,000 years. This is where many say &quot;you took too much&quot;<br><br>I think there is a big misconception in what people think the Musilm want. This isnt the North vs. South as in America as with &quot;inter-ideals&quot;, but a desire to radicate the world of all Jewish people. IMO, it is the Jewish nation of Israel that want to live in peace with its neighbors. Do to the fact that many Arab nations want to re-gain the land that Israel now occupies, Israel cannot let allow Muslims to settle Israelli land by force or by a &quot;friendly gesture&quot;. Although many have pitty on the refugees of Palestine, they just cannot allow them in....Considerably different but not as extreme as America turning BACK boat loads of Cuban refugees [recent].<br><br><br><br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>54</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhalohunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halo Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/29/02 8:25:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> The main problem is that the Palestinians can not and will not live together with the Israelis.  For some mind bending reason they just refuse to, and so much that they even kill them in the streets.  Israel has tried to let the Palestinians live with them, but when they start something like the Six Day War on the most holy day of a Jewish person year and then loose land in it, and then DEMAND the return of it afterwards... I mean, what the hell can be going through their minds?  I suppose I might be biased on this being that I'm Jewish and have a lot of friends from Israel, but I really don't think they're being racist.  I think it's more that there are just so many Palestinians in that area that don't want the Israelis there and are willing to do anything to get rid of them.  For as long as there has been an Israel, the Palestinians have wanted to push them into the sea.<br><br>(Sorry I'm bad with starting new paragraphs when I ramble on about heated topics)  Anyway, whens the last time an Israeli solider ran into a crowded hotel, or cafe, or BAR MITZVA party?  Last I checked that never happened.  Only until recent has Israel taken action against civilians, and I can only think of one time.  On the other hand, Palestinians?  Passover, a Jewish holiday, first night of the festivities?  Something like 50 dead and 100+ wounded?  Or what about blowing up Sbaros (sp? the pizza place) they killed like 15 people including studens and a teacher.  I'm watching CNN right now because they always talk about this stuff on there.  I just heard that the recent super market bombing was the 61st since Sept 2000 or something like that.  Seems like more to me, but I'm not sure.<br><br>Anyway, I didn't think it was right when I read through the first post, didn't really make sense to me.

The war that the arab nations started on Yom Kippur was not the six day war, that was the Yom Kippur war, in 1973.  The six day war was in 1967, and the war itself was started by preemptive strikes that Israel took to remove most of the air capability of the arab nations.  The arab nations were taken quite by surprise, and lost that war very quickly.  The preemptive strikes were taken because Israel felt that a war was imminent.  The Yom Kippur war was quite a different story, and was the closest Israel came to losing a war.  Israel was taken completely by surprise in this case.  It was my 12th birthday when the Yom Kippur war started, and I watched the Syrian planes fly overhead from the rooftop of an apartment building located in a Kibbutz on the Lebanese border.<br><br>In Israel, when you want to say that someone does shoddy work, you say they do &quot;Arab work&quot;, just to give you an example of how ingrained some of the feelings are.  The Palestinians, and most other arabs, are generally speaking, taught to hate the state of Israel, and Jews in general from an early age, on the other hand, Israelis are also ingrained from an early age to hate Arabs.  It may not be part of school curiculim for Israelis as it is for many arabs, but it is still there as part of the general culture.  There are many people on both sides who manage to rise above this, and realize that ultimately, a peaceful solution that is reasonably acceptable to both sides must be worked out if there is ever to be true peace in the region.  There are also far too many people on both sides who don't want a peaceful solution, or don't believe it is possible to have one.<br><br>Part of a peaceful solution is going to have to involve Israel allowing a state of Palestine to exist in areas that are currently controlled by Israel.  It certainly will also have to include stopping terrorist attacks.  It will have to involve both sides deciding that the other has a right to exist as a nation.<br><br>The main problem, as I see it, is that there is a significant minority of people on both sides who cannot and will not see that they have to find some way to share the very small area of land that is Israel, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank.  I believe that if, a reasonable solution looked feasible, it would find significant support from the Palestinian people, and the Israeli people, but there will still exist a very vocal, and violent, minority that will want to sabotage any effort to impliment a solution.<br><br>If I knew the answer to how to solve this problem, I would be up for the Nobel Peace prize, unfortunately, the situation has degenerated to such a point that I don't see a solution.<br><br> <p>The following signature is provided to you by my blatant ripoff of the beautiful and talented Honeybear's signature idea.<SELECT><OPTION SELECTED>Graeme Faelban - 51 Barbarian Mystic -The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Tainniel - 24 Halfling Warrior - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Giluven - 15 Wood Elf Druid -Decadence</OPTION><OPTION>Ganwein - 14 Wood Elf Ranger - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Vardan - 14 Dwarf Paladin - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Tuker - 6 Dark Elf Shadow Knight - Unguilded</OPTION><OPTION>Graekan - 4 Vah Shir Bard - The Appointed</OPTION>Sumnyael - 8 Dark Elf Cleric -The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION></SELECT><span><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74558"target="new">Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 442<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/29/02 9:28:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> Nice piece of writing Rheaton except for one major flaw: there was no state of Israel until 1967 when the UN recognised the Palestinian lands occupied by Zionists through terror as early as the 1930s.<br><br>Up until 1967 the area had always been known as Palestine. The Zionists, motivated by their interpretation of the Jewish scriptures, in 1948 and on were the equivalent of the Hamas today. Except, that the Zionists had financial support through New York and political clout in Washington D.C.; a combination that swiftly gave them a US trained army and modern miltary equipment. The US has always been motivated to have a lacky nation in the Persian Gulf to keep on eye on their oil interests and the cause of Judaism (mind you the Zionist version) fit nicely with US interests.<br><br>Israel is a racist nation and looks like Nazi Germany during the 30s more and more. What supporters of Israel never seem to be able to answer is what makes us think that the generations of Palestinians who owned land in the state of Israel should have been forced to give it away to Zionists to begin with? Please keep in mind that Israeli governments have systematically taken Palestinian land, rounded Palestinians up, and moved them into "Palestinian occupied lands". This is the same model used by the US early in our history to take Native American lands. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/29/02 11:24:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> Lurikeen, you pretty much summed up the root of the problem and argument in the Middle East. There isn't any agreeable historical documentation that states &quot;who got there first&quot;. History does show that the land was occupied by both cultures at some point in time, but it is very uncertain as to who is the &quot;rightful&quot; owner and who drew first blood....so the fight goes on.<br><br>Was there ever a &quot;State of Native America&quot;? No. They lived here though, right? First even? What the U.S government did was wrong in displacing the American Indian, but the fact remains that this was their land first.<br><br>I am not arguing that the U.N, Palestinians, or Israelis ever played by the rules, but I do contend that they are a race of people who are deserving of a land…..Just as the Palestinians are. Hostile take-overs are never a peaceful or diplomatic way to agree, yet I am glad it happened in this country. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I agree that there wasn’t a State of Israel until deemed so by the &quot;powers that be&quot;, but there was indeed a race of people with a heritage and culture that exist(ed).

The state of Israel was then recognized by both the US, and the USSR.  1967 was the year that the UN Security Council resolution 242, calling for the withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied during the 1967 six day war, came about.  I certainly will not deny that Israel has engaged in inexcusable tactics at times, and that the Palestinians have very legitimate grievences against Israel.  The fact remains, that at this time, there are very sizable populations of both jews and arabs living in the area, and it would be good for them to try to find a way to coexist peacefully.  The demographics of quite a large number of places on this earth have changed over time due to a wide variety of factors, including wars, occupation, and other factors.  I am certainly not saying that this is how things should occur, but it is the reality of the situation in the Middle East, and the world as a whole.  There are any number of places in the world where, depending on how far back in time you choose to look, various different people have a &quot;legitimate&quot; claim on the land.  The reality of the current situation in the Middle East is that the state of Israel exists, and is not likely to cease doing so.  There is a sizable Palestinian population both in Israel, and in occupied territories, and in neighboring arab countries, many of whom still live in refugee camps.  They want a better life for themselves, and a piece of land they can call their own.  The only way this can happen is if some type of compromise can be worked out that will be mutually acceptable to both Israel and the Palestinians.  Part of this compromise must include a cessation of terrorism by all parties, not just the Palestinians.  For a while I was beginning to think this was actually possible, and was going to come about, but through the actions of extremists on both sides, the process has been completely derailed.<br><br>Enough rambling for now, I'll continue this when I have some more time.<br><br> <p>The following signature is provided to you by my blatant ripoff of the beautiful and talented Honeybear's signature idea.<SELECT><OPTION SELECTED>Graeme Faelban - 51 Barbarian Mystic -The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Tainniel - 24 Halfling Warrior - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Giluven - 15 Wood Elf Druid -Decadence</OPTION><OPTION>Ganwein - 14 Wood Elf Ranger - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Vardan - 14 Dwarf Paladin - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Tuker - 6 Dark Elf Shadow Knight - Unguilded</OPTION><OPTION>Graekan - 4 Vah Shir Bard - The Appointed</OPTION>Sumnyael - 8 Dark Elf Cleric -The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION></SELECT><span><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74558"target="new">Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 443<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/29/02 3:42:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> Rheaton, any arguments of "who got their first" are futile at best? For example, who were the first people in North America? The Native Americans we are familiar with are not the likely candiates.<br><br>The issue is that the Nationalist-Socialist Zionist movement under David Ben-Gurion pushed for strong Jewish Immagration into Palestine shortly after the fall of the Ottman Empire. Furthermore, Zionists had gained strong support in Great Britain with the leaders of the Tory Party and the Balfour Declaration was devised. You may recall that Balfour and Lloyd George were very devout Christians who were also "Dispensationlists". They thought they could bring in the Millineum that much quicker if there was a "Israel" again.<br><br>The Zionists capitalized on the religious fervor of devout Christians (such as Lloyd George and Balfour) to help them with Jewish immigration into Palestine.<br><br>By the 1930s there were significant numbers of Jewish settlers (Mostly from Russia and Europe) that the Zionists were able to recruit heavily and began using terrorist and guerilla tactics rebelling against Great Britain. By 1948 (with the covert help of elements in the US) David Ben-Gurion and his party declared the independence of the Israeli state. Of course, Harry Truman at once pushed for US recognition of the State of Israel.<br><br>So the question of "who got their first" is rather ridiculous. David Ben-Gurion and his Nationalist-Socialist Zionist party (I forget the name of the party) used the same terror tactics as Hamas and others use today in order to displace Palestinians and take their lands. What the Zionists did is inecusable and the only reason why they got away with it was because of the strong support given to them by the Torries and the US government. If Great Britain and the US didn't have an interest in the region, then there would be no Israel today, but a state of Palestine. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/30/02 7:39:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> It was 1920 or shortly there after when the League of Nations designated this area of British controlled Palestine as the &quot;National Home for Jews.&quot; This was all nice and pretty until the British started limiting the Jewish immigration to this &quot;national home&quot;. With that, the anti-Semitism and the fact that during WWII that the British were detaining, deporting yet restricting the &quot;flow&quot; of Jewish people to their &quot;National Home&quot;...it kinda pissed them off. It was the British that restricted passage to this land. Many agreed that there was to be a State of Israel, but argued over what kind of government would be established. The British have a way of wanting to call the shots in regards to how a British control area is to govern themselves (see American Revolution History).<br><br>The Peel Commission, although abandoned two years later, fueled much of this. It set a statement that there was to be a Jewish State, yet, it was trashed do in large part because the British didn’t want to piss the Arabs off.<br><br>The Jews were being rounded up and slaughtered.

Aside from the holocaust in Nazi Germany Jews weren't being slaughtered for being "Hebrew". The old "persecution of the Jews through the ages" is a myth perpetuated through propoganda to support the Zionist movement and the current racist state of Israel.<br><br>BTW, David Ben-Gurion didn't get a "good taste of Democracy coursing his veins". He was Labor Zionist who firmly believed in the teachings of Marx. His nationlistic fervor shined through his belief that Palestine would become a "Jewish State" via a Jewish speaking labor class. In short he was Nationalist-Socialist. So, I doubt he held to the good old "Red blooded Democracy" you seem to think he did.<br><br>I also don't think you have your facts straight regarding British support of Jewish immagration to Palestine. The support of Jewish immagration to Palestine ended when Lehi and Menachem Begin's gang of terrorists murdered Lord Moyne (personal friend of Winston Churchill) in Cairo of 1944. Up to that time Churchill had even allowed for the creation of a Jewish Brigade to fight in WWII. The point is that Jewish settlers were routinely admitted into Palestine until the 1940s when the Zionists stepped up terrorist activity against Britain.<br><br>Also, it is a matter of public record that the Zionists had full financial support through New York and polical clout in Washington, DC. After the close of WWII the Truman administration, feeling morally bound to assist holocaust Jews to relocate to Palestine, pressured the British government to change its policy over Jewish Immigration. Britain changed its policy due to its financial dependence on the US at the time and its weaking hold on its colonies such as India (which it lost in 1947).<br><br>I could on and on, but will stop here. The Zionists have used shady tactics since the 1840s to try to gain control of Palestine. One has to keep in mind that there is a vast difference between Jewish Immigrants and Zionists. The Zionists comprised a poilitical and military arm in Palestine (again much like Hamas and the PLO) that was able to gain US support. Indeed, heavy arms purchased by financiers in New York funelled their way through the then Czechoslovakia in 1948. Menachem Begin's "Irgun" used those arms to slaughter 250 Arab civilians (mostly women and children) at the village of Dayr Yasin near Jerusalem. At that point Truman began to withdrawl support to the Zionists; however, that was short lived when in 1948 the Zionists, through terror and guerilla tactics, took Jerusalem forcing out the British and decalring the independence of Israel. Truman publicly delcared recognition of the State of Israel.<br><br>There should be no state of Israel. The only reason there is, is because of the tired US support Israel gains (both financial and military). I think the US should pull all support and let the racist Zionist pigs sink to death under the weight of the Palestinians they have oppressed for so long. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/1/02 6:12:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> David Ben-Gurion spent three years in the U.S. after being expelled from Palestine.

Hopefully it will be exposed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/3/02 5:50:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> Gah!

I mean really, what sort of threat do you rationally see coming from Palestine? George Bush's terrorists behind every tree and rock? Sure, we all know that there are many "out there" (where ever "there" is!) who want to destroy the USA, but can you sincerely say that Palestinians are a threat to US national security? I wonder if the US just backed off support to Israel that we would also see the Arab world back off of the US?

There are many implications involved, but aside from those, IMO, we could never trust Palestine. I think that the whole Arab world including Israel has a mindset that we cannot really comprehend. I know its a weak argument but we just don't see it as they do...not sure if we can either. Given that, we have to 'thread the needle' with who we call our 'allies' and at the same time not cut our own throats. We do have interests over there that we must secure.<br><br>Understanding the arguments of both sides is the key to 'peace' over there. That's what I mean when I said &quot;who go there first&quot; cause that is the issue with both sides....that's what they argue about. We cannot, and must not, attempt to erase all history prior to the early to mid 1900's and say &quot;It all started when..&quot;. We must look past this century to get a clearer picture of why these two are at such great odds. To most of the Islamic fundamentalist and 'Zionist', the history means a great deal and is the root of their problems....aside from two conflicting religions which would be enough in itself. <br><br>I see it as this... The Israelis stake claim to a small piece of land which they are willing to share in-part. The Palestinians on the other hand believe that Israel doesn't have rights to claim jack and that they should all be gone. In that, many think that Israel took over the land unrightfully with force, sneaky tactics, and outright terror. I will agree that the Zionist used some fvcked up means to acquire the postage stamp size piece of land.... but the question remains... &quot;Did they ever in the past occupy the land legally and outright?&quot; and i answer that question as &quot;Yes, they were indeed once the occupants who were driven from their land..&quot;<br><br>The argument then turns to religion and their interpretation of what each ones God says..  Its really wacko to tell the truth... however, I am willing to support those who are willing to share the land...not the ones wanting to wage a war of 'genocide'.<br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>54</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugraemefaelban.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graeme Faelban</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/3/02 1:00:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> Rheaton, I believe that your are mistaken on a couple of points.  There are factions on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides that are not willing to share the land.  Some of the members of the faction on the Israeli side are currently part of the government.  The faction on the Palestinian side, actually factions, there are several on both sides, probably has generally had broader support by the general population, due to the fact that the acts which deprived them of their land happened relatively recently, is the one which sends suicide bombers and such to disrupt the peace process.  On the Israeli side, the people are finding it completely unacceptable to have these terrorist acts occur on an almost daily basis, and are rallying behind the idea that negotiating peace with the current Palestinian leaders is just not possible.  Unfortuantely the whole thing creates a viscious circle.  The Israelis retailiate, and crack down on the Palestinians.  The Palestinians feel even more opressed, and support the acts of terror as their only means to fight the Israelis.  So the Israelis crack down.....<br><br>The issue is not so much conflicting religions, it is largely an issue of land, and who should have which parts of the land.  There are definately religious issues when it comes down to some specific sites, particularly Jerusalem, and the Temple Mount, which is a location of extreme religious significance to both sides, but that is not the core issue.  If a way could be found to stop the terrorism on both sides, and to allow for the economic development of the Palestinians, I firmly believe that a solution to the other issues would be found.<br><br> <p>The following signature is provided to you by my blatant ripoff of the beautiful and talented Honeybear's signature idea.<SELECT><OPTION SELECTED>Graeme Faelban - 52 Barbarian Mystic -The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Tainniel - 24 Halfling Warrior - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Giluven - 15 Wood Elf Druid -Decadence</OPTION><OPTION>Ganwein - 14 Wood Elf Ranger - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Vardan - 14 Dwarf Paladin - The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION>Tuker - 6 Dark Elf Shadow Knight - Unguilded</OPTION><OPTION>Graekan - 4 Vah Shir Bard - The Appointed</OPTION>Sumnyael - 8 Dark Elf Cleric -The Appointed</OPTION><OPTION></SELECT><span><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74558"target="new">Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umartigan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Martigan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 999<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/3/02 5:35:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Israeli politics=Hypocratics?</span><hr size=1> >>The old "persecution of the Jews through the ages" is a myth perpetuated through propoganda to support the Zionist movement and the current racist state of Israel.<br><br>I think you listen to too much propaganda and don't study things from both points of view my friend.
