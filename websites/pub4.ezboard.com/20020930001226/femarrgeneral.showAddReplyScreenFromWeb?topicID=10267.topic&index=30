than an assignment/random system. It gives each person the power to go after items they really want, rather than letting someone &quot;assign&quot; what items they think you should have. It's parallel to having your mom choose your clothes and dress you. A lot of folks prefer to have a little more say over what they do and do not gain. <br>
<br>
They key to any system, tho, is that it continues to make the game fun for the player. If the player doesn't have fun in a guild which has officer loot assignment, then another guild might be for that player if loot is that important. <br>
<br>
While loot for myself may not be that important, I have absolutely zero fun watching other players (some whom I would call friends) getting 'screwed' out of something.<br>
<br>
But it boils down to pretty simple terms:<br>
<br>
Officer Assigned : The &quot;power&quot;, and responsibility, is in the hands of one person, or a small group of individuals.<br>
<br>
Points System : The &quot;power&quot;, and responsibility, is in the hands of each and every member of the guild.<br>
<br>
Random System : The &quot;power&quot; is in the luck of the die.<br>
<br>
None of the systems are perfect for every player, but many of the systems are indeed perfect for specific guilds. <br>

<br>
I've seen some of you talk about items going to classes who may need it less than others....but lets use this as an example<br>
<br>
A plate BP drops in ToV<br>
<br>
A warrior who attends 25% of raids wants in on it<br>
A SK who attends 75% of raids wants in on it<br>
<br>
The SK has the most points and wins the BP<br>
<br>
Now, some of you say that the warrior would get the most benefit from it..I disagree....since he only attends 25% of raids his value to the guild is considerably less than the SK who attends 75%.<br>
<br>
Therefore the SK winning the BP benefits the guild, as he will be contributing more to the success of the guild as a whole<br>
<br>
In our guild if they 2 were within 5 points of each other then the BP would be randomed between the two of them.  This works well for us and has been our system for quite sometime.  We're at a point in our guild cycle that loot is starting to &quot;trickle&quot; down to our newer members and so far we seem to be very happy with how our system works <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48001>Zelious Duskstalker</a> <br>

I for one wouldnt roll on the plate BP in ToV because for me the Vindi BP is a better SK item.  It pays to set individual goals....not try to spend points on every item that drops.  Knowing your class and what gear benefits you..and what would be better of in another classes hands.  Or what would be a &quot;minor&quot; upgrade to you and what would be a HUGE upgrade for someone else.  Holding your points for the &quot;dream&quot; item..or one you would never replace goes a long way into making points systems work <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48001>Zelious Duskstalker</a> <br>

<br>
''Bottom line is when players have to spend hard earned points for a item, they are a lot more selective on what they go for, which IMO was a good thing.''<br>
<br>
<br>
That really is a good point and one of the stengths of a points system because no way youre going to blow some points on a so so item if you are saving for your dream one.<br>
<br>
The downside to the points/bid system is that people will (and do) artificially inflate bids on things they know others want simply to lessen that persons points if that person is in competition for ''their type'' of loot (eg plate classes, int casters etc).  <br>
<br>
Example Joe has 190 points and Fred has 150, Joe bids 30 points on some nice item that is a small upgrade for him but wants to make sure he has more than Fred in case uber item X drops, now Fred knows this and so he bids 40 points knowing that Joe will raise his bid (ok he's gambling but people tend to know what other people want) and Joe then bids 50 and wins the item.  Now Joe has 140 and Fred has 150 and Fred knows he can win the bid if the item he wants drops.<br>
<br>
I know some of you may say that such a situation would not happen in your guild....well ok for you that think that i applaud your 100% total non rivalry, complete team effort.  for the rest of the guilds that are normal and do have people in them who have the normal human failings then this happens a lot, sometimes just a small upping of a few points here and there over the course of a few raids and some guy wipes 100 points off all his rivals.<br>
<br>
Its nasty, unfair and not good but a points system is open to that type of abuse.  Another problem with it is that people can conspire to artificially fix the bids on class restricted items.  <br>
<br>
Lets say 3 rogues want a rog only dagger but dotn want to get into a biddign war over it because then they have less points left for the all/all or multiclass stuff, well they simply agree that Joe gets it first for a bid of 25 and then Fred for 25 and then Sam for 25.  On an item they would have bid maybe 75 on.<br>
<br>
You might ask what harm this does?  well it actually harms everyone else who has to bid fairly in non-fixed bidding for their items, while these guys fix their prices low so they can afford more on other stuff.<br>
<br>
A points system is open to both those types of abuse and they are very hard to spot or prove<br>
<br>
<br>
As for officers makign all the calls...well if you were in a guild 3 years ago and grew up with those people (a bit like the old Da'Kor) then yes, i can see that this could work because everyone would know and have complete faith in the guild structure and everyone would know who wanted, needed and deserved what.  But otherwise a lot of people are simply not goign to have the trust required for this, and some decisions are bound to look like favouritism even when they may not be.<br>
Also some decisions MAY be favouritism whereby someone can justify their call but deep down they actually decided that way to fvck over Joe Bloggs for some imagined slight 6 months ago.<br>
<br>
I know magister use this system and it seems to work well for them, but for most guilds its going to cause problems at some time or another, especially with new people who do not have the trust and faith in the loot pickers that the old members may have.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sure there is no one perfect system and they all will have some loophole or another along the way.  As an ex guild leader I and the officers spent a lot of time examinign this issue (as i am sure lots of people do) and the system i came up with is still, to this day IMHO the fairest way to distribute loot while rewardiNG attendance but having no randoms and never puttiNG one peRson in competition with another.  <br>
<br>
I am sure some would disagree, such is EQ.<br>
