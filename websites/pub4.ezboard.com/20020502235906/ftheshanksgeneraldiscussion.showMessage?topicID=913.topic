It was ominously quiet around the gateway as birds and other natural creatures were petrified by what was flocking around the gate.  Grotesque little imps flew all around the portal occasionally vanishing into the blue light that shone from the center of it.  Three people stood at the very center of the evacuated Huldu camp and pondered this new creation before them.  They saw no one else going neither in nor around the gate, and that’s what unnerved the Warrior the most.  He has seen many things in his career, but something about this unsettled him.  This was certainly nothing normal.  As his companions started moving up the hill towards the portal he fell to the rear as is his habit.  If there was trouble afoot, he would see it coming and be able to protect his friend and his wife both.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The blue glow enveloped them both one after the other as they stepped through.  It seemed anxious to have them pass through, and it felt as if they were pulled through at the last moment.  What they stepped into was a daunting sight.  The arched and vaulted walls and ceiling of rock yawned overhead.  Kharl’s instincts set in immediately and as his eyes adjusted to the light he began to take in the scene and what dangers it may pose.  In the distance he saw another portal, similar to the one they had already come through with many a Midgaard valiant nearby.  Unusual shapes crept along the floor and in the shadows of the distance.  Large rat-shaped creatures scurried nearby at the base of what seemed to be a gigantic stairstep.  There were three “steps” each standing an easy two feet higher then Kharl’s head and the companions dropped down them carefully as if trying not to disturb the heavy weight that surrounded them.  Rachir came down the “steps” gently and Kharl gave a hand to Elsebet so that she might not loose her footing on the rocky surface.  They came down into a huge vaulted chamber that lead left and right where the other portal was and there they saw the ashened faces of their countrymen.  Not a word was spoken by anyone, the companions nor the other travelers in this dark place.  That shady blue gloom obscured vision beyond the vaulted archways leading out into more rocky hallways.  The cries of the dying rang out overhead, but this was commonplace.  They had heard it in the Frontier every time there was a raid upon enemy soil or when the defense of Midgaard was called to action.<br>“Which way?  Right or left?” Rachir asked.<br>Kharl was stunned by this breaking of the ominous silence and didn’t respond right away<br>“Right or left?” Rachir asked again.  The ever-curious Elsebet had moved off down the hallway to the left and her silhouette was beginning to vanish into the gloom, alarming Kharl all the more.<br>“I guess Left” Kharl responded, and they headed off into the gloom, unprepared for what they would find.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was little time for sight seeing, as shortly after they began their trek a pair of creatures that resembled long legged turtles standing upon two legs attacked them.  They were easily dispatched, but the sight of them was enough to set Kharl’s defenses to their extreme.  This was not right. Something more was at work here then malformed creatures and the usual frightening things they saw on a daily basis.  They moved on, Kharl’s eyes searching out every nook and cranny for danger.  Elsebet must have felt it to, because she slowed her pace, staying near Rachir and Kharl now rather then running off ahead.  The hallway they traveled through turned and began to rise, heading uphill towards a pair of brown colored dias that supported pillars that stretched up to the roof.  There was a creature, also brown, flying about the pedestal.  As they got closer, the shape of a woman could be made out upon those wings, similar to the sprites near Vindsual.  This creature, however, was no playful mischievous sprite.  Its face was contorted and malformed, dark wide eyes glared out from a messy slop of dark hair upon the demonheus’ head.  She spotted the three and turned, flying quickly back to the area beyond the pedestal, vanishing into the gloom.  As Kharl’s grip tensed upon his shield and axe, the creature came back with two of her brethren and they moved towards the companions quickly.  Rachir began firing at the right most creature, while Elsebet began to stun one of the others.  Kharl could do naught but charge into the fray, axe cutting away wildly as the nearest of the winged horrors.  His actions drew the attention of the other two and soon the three of them were about him, clawing away at his face and hands or punching into his chain armor.  They had no magic, and were weak, giving Kharl the advantage in the fight.  After a harsh battle, the three creatures lied dead about the companions and Eir’s magic flowed through him, soothing and healing his wounds, thanks to Elsebet.<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As they rested, an unholy wail came from their left and a bit further up the hallway.  Kharl’s blood ran cold as they spotted a ghostly robed figure floating ominously nearby.  It paid no direct attention to them, but the rage building in Kharl’s heart drove him up to the thing quickly, axe flashing out in the gloom as he came upon the creature.  He cut into the ghost with a rage, as a deep-seated feeling overtook him.  This had to be destroyed, it did not belong here, and it was not meant to be seen.  The creature let out a horrible wail that turned the Warrior’s blood to ice.  No where in all of his travels had he heard a cry like that.  Its wail of pain seemed to be a chorus of death cries from the many enemies he had faced in his lifetime.  Each cut of the axe, the creature let out one of those mournful cries and retaliated with long, razor sharp talons.  As Kharl battled with the thing he could pay no heed to the arrows flying over his shoulders into the beast or the sight of his wife battering the thing with her hammer to his left.  Kharl could not take his eyes away from those that glowed back at him from within the dark confines of the hood the creature wore.  He saw faces flash, faces of those he had slain in the past, faces of those allies he had seen fall all around him when in battle.  He saw and felt the death throes of each of them within his mind, this shook Kharl to the very center of his being and he fell into a sullen silence after the horror was slain.  He thought quietly to himself…<br>“Is this what we battle for?  Is this where we go when we die?  Is THAT”, he raises his head and looks over to the body of the slain, “worth the turmoil and pain?  I do not want to end up like that, I cannot bear the thought of Elsebet, Rachir or any others I know ending up like this.  I will not lie in a shallow grave or encased in dark rock to be found later beyond a glowing blue portal.  Monsters, I can face… Enemies I can face… This I cannot…”<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The others do not understand, how can they?  Rachir brings his enemies down from a distance, Elsebet holds the prey still, but I still am the one to come upon it and dash the life from them.  I am the one who sees the last glimmer of life whisper away from my enemy.  This was my purpose, my calling, and my life.  I find myself despising this life I have before me and behind me now.  There is no glory, there is no honor in that which I have done in the past.  Perhaps I should follow father’s advice… ‘An enemy is still an enemy, but respect him for being brave enough to stand against a Norseman!’  What does that mean, respect?  How can one respect a true enemy of your home?  Perhaps I should try…”<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a8a8a8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/btheshanks.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fortis>Fortis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Council of Elders</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/18/02 5:29:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=913.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Darkness Falls... and Arrogance dies..</span><hr size=1> Nice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvalcorthehealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valcor the Healer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Patron</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/19/02 3:44:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ftheshanksgeneraldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=913.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Darkness Falls... and Arrogance dies..</span><hr size=1> I won't enter the confines of Darkness the same again.....
