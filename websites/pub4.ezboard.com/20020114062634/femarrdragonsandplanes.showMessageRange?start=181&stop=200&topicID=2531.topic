Interesting definition of &quot;ample.&quot;  I just reread the thread from your lie, and not a single person has stated that they didn't think you misstated facts.  A couple people have told me to zip it, mostly folks I've clashed with on this board before, so hardly impartial votes.

Anyone else with the 'it was one member not the guild action' type attitude, that works in high school, but that is about it.  If you sell some alcohol to a minor, both you and the store you work at get a fine.  If you fugg up in the army both you and your whole troop usually get a punishment in a lot of situations.  This is a blue server, and you are responsible for the company you keep.  Birds of a feather after all. <p>Lemming Twin of Slayne™

<br>
If they're thieves, they're probably court martialed, imprisoned, and then discharged from the armed forces in disgrace.  I don't know of any respectable national defense force that tolerates criminal conduct on the part of its members.<br>
<br>
I suppose your analogy is intended to suggest that it's okay for RoD to keep Medicuus because of her &quot;skills and knowledge.&quot;  In other words, you're so desperate for clerics that you'll keep a thief in your guild.  I think most of the people reading this thread had already figured that out.<br>
<br>
As for bonding, it does not speak well of your guild that your members are apparently bonded to a thief, and that you seem perfectly content to continue sharing a bond with the thief.  Sometimes in life you have to sever bonds.  Would you say, &quot;Yes, Joe Bob is a child molester, but I'm going to keep him as my roommate because we share the bonds of friendship&quot;?

<br>
its not that there were 2 members out of 100 that acted this way.... its the similar way in which the situation was handled each time by the guild's leadership.  Its a pattern of not condoning the behaviour, but seemingly doing nothing to the members that commit the actions.  And it only takes twice before it starts to become a pattern.<br>
<br>
But Berit is gonna make restitution, even if i don't think it's in an appropriate vein considering what happened.  It's still a noble gesture tho, and I accept it.<br>

Ok, reading through all this bullshit, it kind of makes me (and I hope you) relize a few things.<br>
<br>
Ring of Destiny or it's officers are in NO WAY REQUIRED to post here. Expecting and demanding answers from them would be like asking them to the arcade to defend themselves for stealing your swatch. Also, they are not required to discipline their members to to public common belief that they should. And they aren't going to receive any reprocutions even if you send then 20 nasty tells telling them what an ass this person is.<br>
<br>
I do not condone this act, but I don't even remember a post when UI got the druid piece stolen (or something like that).<br>
<br>

And if an individual wears a guildtag they represent that guild in game.  Its just like wearing a badge in real life, just look at the news sometime in a big city. Cop_01 shoots someone and it turns out to be the wrong person.  The whole department takes the heat and folks question as to how this could have happened.  Cop_01 is suspended without pay while an investigation takes place and a verdict reached.  In this case with lame_ass_cleric_01 its blatenly obvious.<br>
<br>
Sure this isn't real life but its reflects your personality and the tag you wear.  Not everyone has to like you, but atleast they will respect you.  Hell I don't care for a lot of people in this game, but I respect them, and I am sure the same could be said about myself.  Talk is cheap, just look at this board for examples, but in game actions speak much louder.<br>
<br>
As for our new server gm, he is a dumbshit.  If you don't believe that try dealing with him sometime and sadly you will quickly learn.  <br>
<br>
Its nice to have chicken shit members in your guild huh RoD? Don't start the you don't know the whole deal thing either, just shove a dick in your mouth and save your breath.<br>
<br>
happy ninja looting!<br>

Guess you're not calling her a lootwhore, just saying she's got her nose up my ass, and something about you naming a blow-up doll after her.

Sure this member did something that is frowned upon by the community and the crime they committed was wrong...does this mean we give them the death penalty and cast them out of our lives forever or do we endeavour to right the wrong that they committed and then rehabilitate the member so that they then become a better person.  Based upon most views on this board I can see why people become outcasts in our own real life communities very quickly.<br>
<br>
I understand that whatever my view on this will be quickly scrutinized and I too will become a victim of your rules and regs and be quickly thrown out, too many of you have proven that already.  What was originally a rant at ONE member quickly became one at an entire guild.  There are people here who don't really care how other people react to this sort of thing, they see it as hey I am right (and in ways you are) so therefore I can make the only judgement on this and everyone elses opinion is rubbish.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with what Medicuus did, and I am sure as hell that they are regretting having done it.  I know that Medi has lost alot of friends across the server due to this action, and that to me would seem a fitting punishment in all of this.  How would you feel knowing you lost a reputation and alot of friends?  However everyone seems to think that someone carrying a guild tag around as well has not had their sentence handed out in full.  Why?!  <br>

Until she showed up on the boards showing her support for you guys, I had no idea who she was.<br>

To me, this is not saying anything is right or wrong once again, there is a difference between and opinion and an action.  I hate Halflings.  Plain and simple.  When I turn my opinion of them into training / KS / ninja looting from them, it becomes an entirely different matter.  Shard and Ram's opinion of your woman is nothing that really deems action, in my eyes, regardless if they are accurate or no.  However if they purposefully trained her, I would hold their actions as up to par with what their guild tolerates.  Just, once again, an observation. <p>Lemming Twin of Slayne™

<br>
Since Shardmoon has posted that MS is in talks with Berit and is cool with the current situation, I won't be adding any more to this thread.<br>

Oh, and Raed, practice Grasshopper. Come back when your kung-fu is stronger and I might let you have a go again. =)<br>
