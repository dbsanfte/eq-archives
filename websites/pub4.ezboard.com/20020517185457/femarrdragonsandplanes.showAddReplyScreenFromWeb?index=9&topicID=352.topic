<br>
This comes from ME ALONE and NOT my guild.  I dunno why SF would invade a Affliction raid in Hate and invoke the PnP play nice policy.  That is SO friggin gay.  Say what you want SF, point is Affliction was there first, you came second, you knew they were there and you went anyways.  Your guild has no respect for anyone, and therefore receives none in return.  Any guild that would go into a plane while another is there is pure trash IMO, and only your guild seems fit to do that to people.  I wonder why you think your guild deserves the right to enter other peoples raids when no other guild on the server does... oh wait, because you are all trash, by bad =) .  Don't get me wrong, I have some friends in the guild, but on the same note I lost respect for them for going into hate when a raid was in progress by another guild.  Only you and your greed seem fit to not respect raids, and then call people farmers who only go into planes once a week when you do 3+ times. <br>
<br>
Drall once said on one of his lame ass posts something about losing honor and finding it.  Perhaps you Drall, should look up honor in the dictionary.  Wait, I will do that for you.  Westers 3rd Ed defines it as 1. High respect (Hmm no one respects you outside your guild) 2. Good Name or Reputation (don't make me laugh, you kill steal up to 50 and now your got a guild to do it with you, and as for reputation....nuff said) 3. Glory or Distinction (well, if invading camps in the type of distinction you want, count me out).<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, killing Innoruuk is a accomplishment, but the methods you chose taint it as well as your guild.  These are my own feelings towards you and your guild.  No need to flame MS, flame me if you can, I welcome anything you can say about my character in the game =)  You are scum and everyone knows it.  Perhaps you should look up respect in the dictionary Drall, you seem to lack it.   <p>Jubei Kibagami <BR>

9am est sro tele sf had 3 groups gtg to poh<br>
server's crash<br>
server's come up<br>
about 15 sf and 15 affliction at sro<br>
ask khelder well i can port or you can port whoever's there first get's zone but that's sorta gay don't ya think?<br>
We just want inno and you guys want gear, which wall are you on? OK we'll go to the opposite wall and start clearing the way to inno. ABSOLUTLY NOT ONE NO FROM KHELDER!!!!!<br>
Port up, one group of affliction in poh and one group of sf in poh, we commence clearing to inno, only statics killed were first 3 houses as needed to get to inno etc. Even offered at one point to help res them as they got wiped.<br>
I see no mention of pnp rules jubei so hrmm shove it up your egotistical ass.<br>
Khelder want's to say we did that ok fine but I know and he know's I didnt' force him to do jack and shit. DG forcefully invoked pnp rules on sf last week while we had been in the zone for 5 hrs and almost to inno, they forcefully said we are coming period along with insurrection.<br>
Know what we did jubei, we lived with it, we didn't rant on a public board like a 2 yr old as you just did, and we didn't cry out trying to tarnish someone, as you just did.<br>
<br>
Get your fact's straight fool, and oh ya jubei i'm sorry your god, please forgive me I wouldn't want you mad at me because I really care what you think jubei.<br>

Ok, number one: I would like to state the fact that you, Jubei, need to learn what is fact and what is fiction. You go off and call me trash, look at yourself.. you take yourself to an all-out low by saying anything in the first place. Bite your lip when it is none of your buisness, apparently you were never taught that. My last sentence may have not made sense to you so... let me put it this way, we were informed there was an agreement made, we went along with what was said and that's how we wound up there.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
Only you and your greed seem fit to not respect raids, and then call people farmers.........<br>
<br>
Number two, well.. we might hit a plane more than once a week, we did 3 times this week and since I have been in SF this has been the tops. Let me ask you this Jubei, no offense to Maeghant, Ablazen, etc.etc. of my friends with you all of course, but how many dragons have you killed this month might I ask? How many have we killed? That's right... none. One hinderance is the fact your guild is constantly doing one,(yes that's right, if you look at it the way I am currently, you technically &quot;farm&quot; dragons), and you know that to be fact. So don't post bs about farming, when you do it on a much larger scale.<br>
<br>

These are my own feelings towards you and your guild.<br>
<br>
Jubei, it takes a mighty small person to judge a group as a whole by what one person says or does. I could have cared less whether I was up there last night or not. Yes it was fun doing what we did, and yes Affliction might have had a right to be mad. I was not there as soon as the servers were up so I would not know, but when two groups meet at the SRo teleport at about the same time and port up just about simultaneously and neither group is going to back down, what can you do may I ask? Since you do seem to be the one to solve all the problems with your last post, maybe I should come to you as my shrink when I have a personal ordeal. What do you say?<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>

<br>
Heh, I would like to see that proven.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>

<br>
Jubei, if you consider yourself to be respectful please show it on the board. Do not insult me, I do not appreciate it at all. I will retaliate, and I will not put up with it either.<br>
<br>
I don't want this post to make me out as a bad guy to all of you out there reading this. I am sure you would do the same thing in my case if you were insulted just because you happened to be in a group of certain friends.<br>
