You're here under the pretext of defending Veeta, but you've already said you're here because you don't want to agree with everyone else because it's too easy.<br>
<br>
Here's what I know. Same day after I gave the money to Veeta she tells me she bought a wurmslayer and is going to resell it. I never hear from her again.<br>
<br>
I never see her online again either. (thx friends list)<br>
<br>
When I gave her the money I told her I didn't want to be repayed. In fact, she told me before I even did, that she would be buying and re-selling for profit to buy even better gear.<br>
<br>
Then I came to the boards, I see the sob story she told, I see the conflicting post on her ex-guild boards. I tried to reason out a way she could be innocent...why? Because I didn't want to accept that I might've been scammed. Because I didn't want to lower myself to bashing on someone, especially when everyone else is.<br>
<br>
After all that thinking, and rewriting my post, rereading the thread, the only thing that came to my mind was 'Damn...so maybe I was scammed.'<br>
<br>
So it came down to a simple post. 'You suck.'<br>
<br>
So Venen...you can rattle off possibilities all you like. I'm content with what I know, and I'm content with what I believe. Everyone else seems to be too.<br>
<br>
This is what I believe in my own mind, what I concluded after much thought, what I believe to be true, and what I stand by. If you believe it was influenced by her spelling errors or feigned lack of knowledge, then you're truly more idiotic than I had originally thought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/10/02 3:26:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=156>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crocker.com/~denise/amflag.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You're here under the pretext of defending Veeta, but you've already said you're here because you don't want to agree with everyone else because it's too easy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'm not here because I don't want to agree with everyone else and I never said that, so please don't put words in my mouth.  All I said was that would be the easier thing for me to do.<br>
<br>
As I said, there are many possibilities for her doing what she did, but you didn't really give her a chance to explain herself and just plopped up &quot;you suck Veeta&quot;.<br>
<br>
I call Veeta a she because her character (Veeta) is a she.

BUT if it makes you feel good then it will be worth it. People forget that, the person doing the giving gets as much out of it as the person recieving. Being generous has its rewards. I hope you dont feel bad though when you realize this char didnt deserve such kindness.<br>
<br>
I use to bartend, this guy would come in every day and spend hours buying pitchers of beer. His job was to stand on the corner and hold a sign saying he was a vet who was homeless and he would work for food. Well people gave him cash. He did indeed get a check from social security and was never a vet. He was not homeless, he was just an alcholic and the social security was not enough to support his drinking habits. This was over 5 yrs ago, I still work downtown and see him a few times a week on the same corner. So.... even though he is lying, I am sure many who gave him money felt good that they helped a homeless veteran and that feeling can be priceless. I am sure if I went and told many of them where he spends their money, they would be disappointed and some maybe wouldnt believe me. Veeta reminds me of this guy. Personally I did still feel some compassion for him, I would never want to trade places with the guy. He gave his life to the bottle, that in itself is rather sad.<br>
<br>
So, ask yourself this question, &quot;If I find out after I help him that veeta was just a scammer, will I regret the help I gave?&quot; If the answer is you will regret it, then maybe you should reconsider helping him. If you wont regret it and are willing to take the chance that he is indeed scamming you, then help him out. That way you wont end up having regrets. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/10/02 9:50:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=163>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crocker.com/~denise/amflag.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> I'm not sure where it was said that he had actually FOUND the body and was looking for a rez?

Honestly it sounds to me like she didn't want anyone going out of her way for her, and probably didn't realize that the officer was that close to getting her corpse.  After all, we all want our corpses, even the greediest scammers out there.  <br>
<br>
I'm willing to go either way here, but the only evidence I've seen thus far is &quot;she types l33t!&quot;.  Innocent until proven guilty (note the &quot;proven&quot;).  If it even LOOKED like she was scamming, I might question myself on it, but to me it just looks like she wanted some help, and people got pissed... thought she was beggar, and ragged on her for no reason... and in order to justify themselves they tried everything possible to make her look like a scammer, sorry but that doesn't work for me.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing this for public attention, if I was I probably would have started this with a full rant instead of a simple &quot;If you need equip please contact me in-game Veeta&quot;.

That was about five minutes after that Officer started looking, mind you. He could not tell where he had died in OT as well.<br>
