<br>
Please explain why this doesnt deserve to be here ?<br>
<br>
The shit list is for people who act in a malicious matter.  People who go out of their way to be a prick.<br>
<br>
Alnaron killed a member of his own team, in a pvp teams event.  This player was 29 levels below him, and thus had no defense against him.<br>
<br>
This player is a Human, and this the same race as alnaron ( thus all the talk about &quot; he is a gnome&quot; is just bullshit, by Alnaron, and seemingly by yourself.<br>
<br>
He decided to attack someone in the arena on the same team, in a verant sponsered GM event.  I am SURE there were MANY MANY other targets he could have chosen in the arena at that time, but he chose to kill someone of the same race as him ( and thus, according to the rules of engagement , not expecting any sort of attack from him ).<br>
<br>
He did this, for what reason ?  It certainly isnt some sort of sick roleplay , since the person is a Human just like Alnaron. <br>
<br>
He did it &quot; to be a prick &quot;.  There is NO other explanation for it.  You come here and defend him by saying :<br>
<br>
&quot; he had a right to be a prick, he was in the arena for christ sake &quot;.  <br>
<br>
He comes here and says :<br>
<br>
&quot;my guild leader was in my group, and i always break the rules in verant events &quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
This makes it alright ?  This means its &quot;OK&quot; to kill someone on your own team, in a sponsered event by verant ( which has nothing to do with the person being a gnome so get off that stupid point ), when there were plenty of people there for him to kill other than this HUMAN WARRIOR ON THE SAME TEAM ?<br>
<br>
If that is not an example of someone being a prick ( and thus, the post being worthy ), please explain what is.<br>
<br>

<br>
Damn, I didn't say that...don't misquote me.  My problem is,  what was really lost here? Why was no attempt made to correct this before it was shitlisted?  It's bullshit.  Why does all the drama have to be in every single thing that happens on Lanys.<br>
<br>
The fact is, it's the arena, anyone can and will be killed regardless of if it is a GM event.  That's why Frizznik was there handing out DT's.  Did Alnaron get DT'd for screwing around?  Answer:  Yes.  Did Frizznik do his job?  Answer: Yes.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with shitlisting someone just because you think they are an ass.  Everyone plays this game for a reason, they all have individual personalities.  Like I said before, yes, Alnaron IS an ass. That's well-known on the server.  But the fact that he's an ass doesn't give credence to this post that was made like what?  5 minutes after it happened? 10 min?<br>
<br>
I thought the Shit list was supposed to be used as sort of a last resort, when going through the proper channels had failed.  Posting right after it happens with no attempt to have something done about it through the guild just makes the shit list poster look like a scrub.<br>
<br>
Malicious?  How is it malicious if we know before hand its in a PvP arena...we KNOW he's gonna be bound there or get revived or rezzed back in.  Sure, Alnaron shouldn't have done it. This I agree, but I'm not gonna shitlist him for it, it's just stupid. <br>
<br>
PvP arenas are put there for one thing...Death, you go there, expect the unexpected, and don't bitch when the unexpected eats your ass for breakfast.<br>
<br>
I don't usually post defense for anyone, but I'm really sick of stupid ass shit list posts.<br>

<br>
The fact that the Guild leader of Dark Trinity was in the group when alnaron decided to be a prick and kill someone who had no idea a person FROM THE SAME TEAM, AND 29 levels higher would kill him shows what would have probably happened when / if the officers of Dark Trinity were contacted.<br>
<br>
Yes, Alnaron is an ass.  YES , this deserves to be here.<br>
<br>
What was harmed ? Alnaron decided to ruin one persons fun, &quot;just because he could&quot;.  There is no other reason.  What was harmed ? That persons gaming session was ruined.<br>
<br>
If alnaron was on a different team, then yeah he should have been killing everyone not on that team.<br>
<br>
If this person was a gnome, and alnaron was like felishana ( a HARD CORE role player ), then it would make sense.<br>
<br>
He is neither.  He is an ass, who decided to kill someone on the same team &quot; because he could, and he breaks the rules at all verants events &quot;.  He KNEW this person would NOT be expecting an attack from someone on his own team, and he KNEW that there were PLENTY of other people in the arena to kill.<br>
<br>
He chose to kill THIS guy ON HIS OWN TEAM.. to be a prick and ruin it for someone.  <br>
<br>
No, it is NOT reasonable to expect this to happen in a GM event.  No , just because he got DT ed by the GM doesnt make it right.  If you do something wrong, and get punished, does that mean what you did is no longer wrong ?<br>
<br>
Whether the person lost EXP or not is irrelevant.  Not everthing in this game revolves around exp ( gained or lost ) or Items.  Sometimes, people play to do things that are fun.  If this person went to the arena , they DID have the expectation of dying.  They DID NOT have the expectation of someone calling them a gnome ( which they arent ) , and killing them for the sheer pleasure of killing someone 29 levels lower and watching them act surprised cause they were on the same team.<br>
<br>
The reason this should stay is it shows EXACTLY what type of person Alnaron was, and IS, and people need to know that.<br>
<br>
THATS why it belongs here.  Please dont Delete or move it, moderators.  Alnaron has exibited a pattern of behaviour in the past, and this shows that that pattern continues.<br>

in regards to what happened, alnaron is simply an individual who gets enjoyment out of doing things that he wants.  for all his knowledge of his class, for all of his dedication for being a great warrior, for all the phat l00t he has on his person to make him a more efficient warrior, it boils down to one simple thing- how does he treat others in the game.  thankfully, alnaron has proven time and time again that he is part of the immature, whiny, childish antics of the 13-18 year old crowd on this server.<br>

congratulations alnaron for continuing your behavior on the server and proving just what type of person *NOT PLAYER, big difference* you really are sitting in front of your computer.<br>

Alnaron is extremely loyal to his guild, thus his guild is extremely loyal back to him.

Also your statement concering him not deserving to be in &quot;any guild&quot; is bull shit.  Should Alnarons game play and Dark Trinity check in with you for approval on our choices of guildmates?  I don't think so.  He is a valuable member of guild and i'm PROUD to be a guildmate of his.<br>

<br>
My point is that the shit list shouldn't be moderated on a personal opinion, but a standard.<br>
<br>
Leave it, can it... I don't really care.  But there are many different ways of being an asshole, and everyone's opinion is going to differ.  People get posted here for things that I think are dumb, but lots of others think it's ok and justified.<br>
<br>
This board should be a place to come and say &quot;Hey, this guy pissed me off, I think he's an asshole, this is what happened, and do with it what you will&quot;.  Not a place where someone comes to share a bad experience and they're told that it's not bad enough in a moderators opinion, so it's being canned.  <br>
<br>
I pretty sure that we can think for ourselves and can read something and decide with our own minds if this is a person we want to be wary of.  Do we need moderators to tell us what we think is asshole, and what isn't?  <br>

Comments like yours make it very clear what Dark Trinity players see as a standard of action, and behaviour.<br>
<br>
It also makes it abundantly clear that the original poster bringing it to the attention of the guild would have done little.<br>
<br>
The original poster assumed that The guild Dark Trinity wouldnt take pride in one of their members deriving pleasure from causing another misfortune.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that, at least for YOU, it is perfectly ok to do whatever makes you happy, even if that is screwing someone else over.<br>
<br>
There is a time, and a place to defend your guildmates.  Generally, when they are being assholes is not one of them.  <br>
<br>
From the members of Dark Trinity that have posted here, Alnaron's actions are seen as &quot;ok cause he was in the arena&quot;, or &quot; ok because you didnt lose experience&quot;, or &quot; ok cause, well hey you should have expected to die by someone on your own team in a verant event you know ?&quot;<br>
<br>
I honestly would like to know if Dark Trinity officers have the same feeling about this type of play as their members seem to. <p><a href="http://www.mithrilweb.com//"target="web"><img src="http://www.mithrilweb.com/images/sigs/llosig.jpg" border="0">

Stereotyping is one of the biggest flaws in debating.  Don't stereotype me, I don't stereotype you.  Your comment assumes that all of Dark Trinity is the same.  That's wrong.  I've already said what Alnaron did is WRONG, but I don't think it's shitlistable because not all of the posting regulations were adhered to.  If he had attempted to talk it over with Karsys or an officer, then I wouldn't be here defending Alnaron. Case closed.  You can speculate what would have happened if he had, but that doesn't change the fact that NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE.<br>

I'm not even going to quote what Psycho Otik said, because that attitude belongs nowhere in this forum. Crowde, taunting Jolted (even though you may not have tried) isn't exactly helping the situation. I dont see how you all think by defending Alnaron like that then Leolan is going to take it down. Your words mean nothing when all they do is flame someone for posting an incident which they feel they were very wronged. You are not Jolted are you? No, you aren't. You shouldn't tell him what he should or SHOULD NOT be upset about. <br>
<br>
Just to clear up facts here that i've read.<br>
1) Alnaron got DT'd 5 times BECAUSE HE ATTACKED frizznik 5 times. Said by himself. <br>
<br>
2) Alnaron said he doesn't believe in following GM events. Let me ask you this elite fools, since when were you not newbies? Did you just start at 50+? Maybe you should all remember events where you were glad nothing happened, or you were sad someone decided to mess things up by attacking the main character when they said to back off. You seriously want to contribute to the downfall of Lanys by DEFENDING what he said? Give me a break, everyone deserves a good time, but Alnaron's good time shouldn't be at the expense of others.<br>
<br>
I sincerely hopes Leolan leaves this up and you all realize what you've said, because many will not forget it. You may not realize the seriousness in discarding a level 30's complaints, but others do. And Leolan said he'd wait for an answer. Did he get an answer? No, he got told by Alnaron how Alnaron will play the game no matter what. That is not the answer Leolan is looking for when thinking about deleting the topic, i'd even think that's the sort of response/attitude Leolan looks for when deciding to LEAVE UP a topic like this.<br>

I do not speak for all of Dark Trinity.  I play the game to have fun.  I expect all of you do the same.  I do not condone Alnarons actions, and I would not do what he did.  But I also dont, and neither do you, have the right to tell Alnaron how he can play his game.  The GM's have that right.  If Alnaron thinks its fun to kill level 31 characters thats fine, hes allowed to, he pays his 10 bucks a month.  If you dont like it, too bad, he pays to play a game the way he wants to.  Crowde is right the proper steps were not taken to make this a shitlistable offence.<br>
<br>
Don't you dare stereotype a guild based on one persons comments.  I DO NOT speak for Dark Trinity.  I speak for Psych.  I speak that Psych believes that every individual should be allowed to play the game the way they choose to.  When a GM bans someone that is because they crossed the lines, those lines are set by gms, not by you.<br>
<br>
I don't like making enemies, I am generally not an ass, but I will always defend a players right to play the game how they choose.  The person that started this thread did not contact any members of Dark Trinitys officer core to speak to this situation.  They just auto shitlisted.  Thats crap.  If I had a pp for every assholic thing ive witnessed in the two years ive played EQ I would be maldan.<br>

Pretty much every person on the shitlist is shitlisted for playing the game &quot;how they want to&quot;.  Are you saying that no one should be shitlisted unless they are banned??  You're saying that it's ok for people to wrong others, as long as they are having fun themselves??  <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/Aarreran.gif"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaarreran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aarreran</A> at: 5/8/01 9:07:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ullorianlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llorian Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 9:07:48 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alnaron</span><hr size=1> Crowde and Psyc<br>
<br>
Alnaron stated that &quot; my guildleader was in the group with me &quot;.<br>
<br>
Does that not imply that he knew what was going on ?<br>
<br>
Both of you are talking out of both sides of your mouth.  one the one hand you NOW say :<br>
<br>
&quot; what he did was wrong , i wouldnt do it &quot;<br>
<br>
But also say <br>
<br>
&quot;it was ok for him to do it&quot;<br>
<br>
Which is it ?<br>
<br>
Also, My &quot;sterotyping&quot; came from 2 members of Dark Trinity comming to this thread and saying what Alnaron did was ok.  Pysc even says in his last post that he pays his 10 bucks a month and should be entitled to do whatever the hell he wants to do, even if that is killing level 31 warriors in a teams event.<br>
<br>
/shrug, you are EXACTLY right pysc.  No one can dictate what an individual can, and cant do in game.  They can do whatever the hell they want to do.  We CAN dictate who we choose to associate with, however. <br>
<br>
Crowde.  I am not trying to make an enemy of anyone.  I cant say i blame you for wanting to stick up for a guildie, but, i honestly feel your good intentions are misplaced this time.<br>
<br>
Pysc.. I will have to agree to disagree with you, on the subject of whether someone has the right to do whatever the hell they want to do, even if it ruins someone elses fun.  I dont think you would have that opinion if you were camping in sebilis or something, and someone repeatedly trained you causing death.... then told you :<br>
<br>
&quot;its my idea of fun causing you death, deal with it&quot;.<br>

1) Yes, Alnaron was wrong for what he did.  That is what I'm saying.<br>
<br>
The only reason I posted (which makes me mad, cuz I'm really a proponent for rules on the Shit List).  I just wish he would have said something to an officer or something like the Shit List rules say...it would have cleared about all of this up, and I bet there wouldn't even need to be all these posts here.<br>

OMG I coudnt stop laughing at this post.<br>
<br>
Ok now onto some more seriouse Thoughts....<br>
<br>
Hmm....a bunch of peeps entered a PvP arena to participate in a Race on Race event.  An individual attacked another individual on the same race, the 1 individual was Significantly lower level than the other.  That individual dies.<br>
<br>
The Lower level individual came to the event to Have Fun.  To assist his race (as the rules allowed) and that fun was abruptly ended by a callouse act by the higher level individual.  I wont say Maliciouse cause Alnaron is not really a maliciouse person.<br>
<br>
What happened was wrong.  And Alnaron should apologise for it.<br>
<br>
BUT is this shitlistable?<br>
<br>
Not really, No....Granted Alnaron was on the shitlist long ago but since then I have seen marked improvement in his attitude and game style.  So that dosnt indicate a specific pattern.  The Alnaron of a year ago is Far FAR different from the Alnaron today.<br>
<br>
Furthermore its my beleife that the shitlist is a means of last resort.  The 31 warrior should have contacted me or another officer of the guild to see if this could be resolved.  If that failed then The shitlist applies.<br>
<br>
AND this was a PvP event....<br>
<br>
And Lorian/Arodan...dont ever make generalisations about me or my guild again.  Ive known ya quite some time and I cant ever remember you being this bitter.<br>
<br>
What you see from the posts by other members of Dark Trinity is Loyalty to another member, Loyalty to their chosen Family.  And that is something I am proud to see as the Leader of this guild.<br>

Posts must be done by players actually playing on Lanys T`Vyl, by a registered EZboard account. <br>
<br>
#2 - No posts may be made anonymously. Your characters name in game must be made known if you are to put another character's name on the shitlist. <br>
<br>
#3 - MOST posts are given a trial lifespan of 7 days. During this time, players may add other similar things happening with the shitlisted player, defend them, etc. However, the lifespan of a post is not guaranteed. Posts such as &quot;JoeDr00d didn't port me to EC&quot; will be deleted on sight, as will any posts that are deemed by the moderators to be unworthy of even a trial. <br>
<br>
#4 - During this 7 day period, if the story is still being uncovered or added to, the post will be allowed to stay until a relative period of stasis. At the end of this period, it will be determined by the moderators whether or not this person is going to be deleted or remain on list. <br>
<br>
#5 - Shitlisted Players that are deemed worthy of their placement here will be kept on the shitlist permanently, accessible from the main page of lanys.com as well as the forum itself. To be deemed worthy means that there has been enough testimony and evidence brought forth to make a substantial case. In the world of EQ, 100% proof is nearly impossible to come by, but common<br>
sense and good judgement are more than enough. <br>
<br>
#6 - Shitlist posts that are deemed insufficient based on their merits will be locked and taken down, with an explanation given by the moderator. In some cases the explanation may be left open so players can respond, but in many, the case is closed when the moderator renders it so. <br>
<br>
We'd like to stress the severity of being posted here. A post here means that the said player should be avoided at all costs, as they have proven themselves to be dishonorable. Please make every attempt to resolve the issue with the player's guild, the player's friends, the player, etc., before posting here. Please treat this as a last resort. <br>
<br>
Also please realize that situations or cases arise where the moderators have to make a judgement call. In these cases, the decisions of the moderator are final, but must be made unanimously by the moderators. <br>
<br>

K with that being re-outlined...sorry it didnt paste very well....<br>
<br>
I do feel that shit listing someone means this person has done something extremely wrong, has done so to many people, over and over.  And, if guilded, officers were contacted.<br>
<br>
This was a GM controlled event.  After killing the warrior Alnaron was dted 5 times.  Is that not punishment for his transgression?  This event was controlled by the only people that can regulate your game play.  So do you think that Alnaron can play his game the way he wants to?  Was he punished for what he did?  Was this whole event watched over by the only people that regulate our game play?  Was Alnaron banned? And if not why?  The GMs knew what he did, and didnt act, doesn't that make you wonder why they didnt?  Maybe cause caos is the flavor of a PvP event?<br>
<br>
What happened here sounds like a gm event got out of control (no big suprise here), testosterone warrior got out of control, and ganked a teamate.  Does that mean that the poster should attack a whole guild along with the individual on shit list board?  I don't know, maybe on Lanys thats how its done.<br>
<br>
I will appologize for the Gnome sex organ comment.  I was trying to be a bit shakespearean.  Little sexual humor to break up a serious post.  Sensitive ears, you have my appology.<br>
