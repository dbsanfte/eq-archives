Will the bickering and hording of the high level game ever calm down to the point of enjoyable, friendly gamesmanship (if that is even a word =) )  again, or will things continue to degenerate. Look back through the old posts on this board.... see how hateful most of them have become lately over greed??? I have always played the game for fun, and fun for me is based on the interaction between people from all around the world.... should i give up now and save myself the dissappointment i am facing if i choose to hunt outside of my guild at higher levels??? i dunno -- guess what i really wanna know, is if anyone still comes to this board for reasons other than to rehash something that could've/should've been left in game.....<br>

When Luclin comes out a lot of the loot whores and GGG's (god's gift to gaming) will move over there for the badge's of honor of taking down the moondragons, and will leave the other spots alone for a while.  Lot less foolishness then.<br>

As for this board, ignore it.  It isn't reflective of EMarr as a whole, just the lunatic fringe.  None of the folks I hang out with in the game EVER come here, because it's so full of venom and sewage.  I'm fascinated by the wacko's that congregate here (and have occasional lapses of my medication), so get a kick out of it.<br>
<br>
Basically, if the game isn't fun any more, stop playing for a while.  Maybe you'll come to miss it later, and get a better attitude about the crap.  Nothing wrong with taking a break from the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unirecnadthetrademaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nirecnad the Trademaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1251<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/13/01 3:15:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sickened....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Yes, when SoL comes out people will go there because xguild and qguild and bguild and xxguild all think they need to have the first new bp from that continent so they can be more &quot;uber&quot; than the other guilds. Once the guilds and loot crazed players all decide to play nicely, which will not be any time soon at all, the bickering will stop. Do I see it happening any time soon? Nope. Do I see it happening ever? I'm not so sure. If you want to quit over bickering go for it, but I suggest you take a break for a little while until you get one of those urges to play again (you know, the ones you got when you had just gotten to level 8, and needed your new spells).<br>

There is a lot of greed in the game, but this is not the place to look for positive things.. <br>
<br>
And there are still many positive things and people in the game.  And believe me sis if I can say this..<br>
<br>
Not all high levels are obsessed with loot or experiance or getting their toes stepped on.  Your guild has some fine people in it.  Redd, Skan, Jalec, Nekarb, Calist, Balina, and im sure some others (dun be offended if i didnt mention you please).  My guild has some great people in it too, Tristian, Suntoucher, Tormark, Xzanthos, Vestalyn, ember, Uamila, Lorentic, and the list goes on, dont be offended if i didnt list you please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I would bet there are people like that in every guild on our server.  I know great people in MS, EH, and especially in CE.  Even in UI.  And in numerous other guilds.<br>
<br>
So when you think about it there are alot of nice people on Emarr.  They just dont make as much noise.<br>

<br>
Are you really sickened or are you just a little annoyed?<br>
<br>
If you're sickened then you yourself have forgotten that this is a game. It's nothing to be sick about. You should quit immediately.<br>
<br>
If you're annoyed take some time out. I took a month at level 30 just to sit back and think did I really want to invest the time I was doing and would need to to continue to higher levels. The answer was yes.<br>
<br>
The other thing that stops EQ being an irritation for me..../q the ability to walk away from a game and go and do something else instead.<br>

I had talked about some of the people I had met while playing and I see them now with level 60 before their name and wielding their epics. I said it sometimes felt odd seeing them around like that, my friend told me that she sometimes wished she were in my position because as you get closer and closer to the &quot;end game&quot; it becomes alot more crowded and much more hotly contested. I finished with that conversation with a whole new percpective I do like the idea of being able to do the &quot;end game&quot; things but also relish how infrequently the contention effects me. I think you should keep playing if you can just go do your thing whether it be Derv camp 2 in N ro or ToV have fun and not take it too hard when someone says they hate you and wish you would die over something that happens in game.<br>

Having played on about half the servers, this one had always been the most civil and friendly that could be found, now the server seems full of pissed off high level players, or twinks played by pissed off high level players that bring the end game attitude even to the lower level zones.... It seems as if it's the friendly players that walk away from the game, and the obsessive ones that stick around groping for their next prize. The server population may be slowly declining, but it seems so is the quality. This is not to say that there aren't a good number of really outstanding players.... but if half the server pop is made up of assholes --- then that means if you group with anyone outside of your normal group/guild you stand a good chance of half of your group being of this type....... as long as there are new goodies to be had these types will stay --- while fewer and fewer of the people that play for fun remain... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulyninlevalrion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lynin leValrion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/14/01 3:58:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sickened....</span><hr size=1> Any MMORPG will have the same(or similar) problems as other ones.

First you take a 6 foot long pole.  Make sure its got lots of splinters and stuff in it.  Then when you find a customer you ask them politely to turn around while you look something up, you only ask them to turn around so that you wont be able to know how they do something.

If anything, this post is endemic of the whiney pussy posts that we have seen so much of lately, where people post some awful problem they have in real life and they seek some sort of solace on a GAME FORUM.  God knows these posts are certainly eliciting  a ton of sympathy if the number of responses mean anything, but it's really kind of sad that these folks can't find a more productive outlet for their problems.  Heh, then again, I guess that's what this post is too, in it's own way.<br>
Stick it!<br>

I'm not seeking solace -- i have no real life problems i need your help with ---- and i certainly wouldn't post here for sympathy. Thanks for your flame though...... nice to know that i wasn't completely dillusional about the number of irrationally rude people that seem to be hanging around this (and most other eq) board.<br>
          It's really ironic Mr Bodie, that you choose to get so worked up about posts made on what you yourself named a &quot;game forum&quot;. You wanted to vent -- i can respect that -- but honestly, which one of use truly sounds like the burnout?? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umrbodie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mr  Bodie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/15/01 2:59:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Yup</span><hr size=1> Thanks for pointing out what I had already pointed out in the last sentence of my post.<br>

Anyways, to answer your &quot;actual question&quot;,  I would say that the higher end game is still cut-throat, but it's way more affable, especially when you consider how hard some of the people in the top guilds compete.  Shitting on someone game-wise is not taken as personally.  It's just generally more business-like.  Someone like you, however, would be mocked heavily, I think.<br>
