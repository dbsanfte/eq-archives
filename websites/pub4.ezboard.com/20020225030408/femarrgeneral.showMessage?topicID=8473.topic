Walk in my boots the path of Heyokah...<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
At a campfire outside of Halas, the guildmembers of Crimson Eternity gathered to reflect upon the happenings of the past month.  From far and wide, humans barbarians and elves gathered to discuss policies, events, and tales of lore.<br>
<br>
Standing near the campfire, and highlighted by the flames against a snowy backdrop, Saelar, a necromancer of some importance, closed the formal portion of the meeting...<br>
<br>
&quot;That concludes the business of the day.  Does anyone have anything to add?&quot;<br>
<br>
A hand was raised...<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, the chair recognizes the shaman in the middle.  What say you, Tanuden?&quot;<br>
<br>
Standing, the shaman in question spoke in a thick Highland accent.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Me be wondering ifn me could have the floor to spin a tale?&quot;<br>
<br>
Muffled groans were heard because the assembled guildmembers knew Tanuden, although possessing the gift of clarity, also possessed the gift of longwindedness, so this story could go on for some time.<br>
<br>
Saelar brought the crowd to order by rapping his weapon against a burning log on the fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let him speak, LET HIM SPEAK!!  It has been long since we heard a good story.&quot;<br>
<br>
Westleey turned to Liou, &quot;I could be camping that turtle in the time this foolish barbarian tells the story.&quot;<br>
<br>
Liou glanced over and stated the obvious,&quot;** did him earlier, and they would do him again, even if you were there to camp it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good point,&quot; finished Westleey with a nod.<br>
<br>
Tanuden made his way to the campfire.  He was far from the imposing figure.  Not the tallest, not the most advanced in rank, not an officer, and not walking very well due to numerous beatings at the hands of critters, he strode with a slight limp and a smirk to the fire.  Taking a knee, he produced a container of liquid from his cloak.  The cloak, full of holes and wear, had a story of its own, but tonight was not it's night.<br>
<br>
&quot;My friends, me be here to tell you a tale that began when me be in my 44th winter of life...<br>
<br>
&quot;Shit, I knew it, he is 58 now, we are NEVER getting out of here!!!&quot; whispered Dalanon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let him talk.  He asked me here as a guest, and I want to hear what he says,&quot; replied Tandrid.<br>
<br>
&quot;...in honor of Halas.  Me chose to walk on the path of Heyokah.  A pirate, two spirits, an ogre, a ghost and his friends, a lightsource, and a couple of enemies were encountered along the way to getting this...<br>
<br>
Tanuden holds above his head a Shield of Falsehood, of which there was some comment.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have never seen him use that thing,&quot; remarks Icessis.<br>
<br>
&quot;He stopped using it when he got the Sarnak Battle Shield,&quot; comments Sejal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Doesn't that thing have wisdom?&quot; asked Azeroth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, but Tanuden was never known for being the wisest of the bunch,&quot; quipped Shardon.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and there the journey stopped, forever it seemed.  The path of Heyokah became too difficult, and my friends lacked the strength to help me progress.&quot;<br>
<br>
A stein swung in the air.  &quot;Ahh, but I was there for the next part, I was there!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tanuden smiled at the dwarf.  &quot;Aye that do be true, Window, but so were they.&quot;  Tanuden gestured to a group of beings who had up to this point been silent.  They were all there, basking in the firelight with ale flowing by the keg.  Ulatek, guildleader of United Partisan's Service.  Tuluvenai the bard, Upsguya the Cleric, Jehaliel the ranger, Seldila the enchanter, Thantoz and Glazier the paladins, Nentin the necromancer, Monday the warrior, and an elvish lady who up to this point no one knew...<br>
<br>
&quot;I was there as well, you big hairy oaff!&quot; yelled the woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, that you were, lady Oriania.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tanuden reached into his cloak, and pulled out a perfect rose, red with white frost crystals on it.  A gentle toss landed the flower into Oriania's open hand, and for that Tanuden was rewarded with a smile and a wink.<br>
<br>
&quot;These do be the folks that helped me slay the dreaded wolf Black Dire in Mistmoore Castle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many huzzahs, claps, and weapon thumps later, Ulatek stood up and responded simply, &quot;It was all we could do, and we are glad you moved along the path.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Without your help, Me could not have progressed...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;GET ON WITH IT!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raising an eyebrow, Tanuden smirked at Tuluvenai.  &quot;As you wish, m'lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Again, the path became difficult, but more friends helped me along the way.&quot;  Tanuden once again gestured to the crowd, and another gathering rose up with a cheer...<br>
<br>
&quot;Ghiosk didn't know what hit him!&quot; shouted the attending representatives of old Stone Guard, Lanya and Syke.  Several Crimson Eternity members, all formerly Stone Guard, took the time to sit with them as well, taking the time to relive memories and exchange pleasantries.<br>
<br>
&quot;Neither did the broodling,&quot; smiled Kavis, the representative of the Phoenix Crusaders.<br>
<br>
A sigh was heard over the crackle of the burning logs.  &quot;The path stopped there, for the longest time.  Me be talkin with a rogue named Retrieve, a resident of the Hole near Paineel, and he be tellin me there was no way Me was going to just walk down to Kirn.  He be too deep in, and too well guarded.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;BAH, we almost got to him with a group of 6!!&quot; laughed an unseen rogue, a brother of Sispis.<br>
<br>
Tanuden smiled, &quot;Aye, that was a fun time...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tuluvenai glared, and Tanuden got the message.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well that brings me to you fine folks.  Various members of Crimson Eternity proved me wrong.  The journey into the Hole, although dangerous, can be done with talented friends.  Kirn fell to the assembled might of 18 warlords, healers and casters.  The trip was fast and furious, but in the end Crimson Eternity prevailed.  In fact, the journey had to be completed twice because Kirn didn't want us getting near him the first time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Loud cheers and applause rose around the campfire.  Chatter rose and fell with the sounds.<br>
<br>
&quot;He did the run down the Hole twice?&quot; asked Darkbindress.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, and he was foiled by some fools from earlier in the week, and by a mysterious god called Verant Interactive,&quot; commented Quis.<br>
<br>
&quot;Boy I didn't spend enough time with Tan telling him to speed things up,&quot; chuckled Sispis.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's his way, painful at times, but entertaining,&quot; laughed Cisrab.<br>
<br>
As the noise died down, Tanuden smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, but the best part was yet to come.  After an epic day for Crimson Eternity involving two golems, two dragons, and a new snakecharmer...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tanuden waves at Technitis.<br>
<br>
&quot;...a request was made to finish my journey, and volunteers came forward for the journey to City of Mist.  Magicians Bretai, Magyk, and Eincro, Rangers Tilian and Nistalk, Enchanter Ninya, Warrior Togam, Rogues Gavan and Khelder, Druid Mozza, Wizard Atuari, Cleric Euedien, Monk Liou, and a brother shaman...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tanuden again pointed, and Uruz smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;After some, ahem, technical difficulties, Neh fell before the assembled force with minimal loss.  Off Me went to talk to the spirits, and they said Me should be talkin with Lord Rak.  We knew where he be since we had to pass him on the way to Neh.  Everything seemed in order, and the light at the end of the path was in sight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, NOT QUITE!!&quot; yelled Tilian.<br>
<br>
Tanuden blushed, &quot;Ahh, well, lets just say it got a bit ugly.  Tilian volunteered to bring Rak to our force, but Rak didn't want to stick around after vanquising the ranger, thus making it an official raid...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tilian changes to a perfect hue of magenta.<br>
<br>
&quot;...so a new plan is forged.  Me went with Tilian into the house to talk with Rak, but the denizens of the city not be lettin me get to him.  After a pitched battle with the creatures, Me gave the child's tear to Rak, and he not be happy.  Out he came in his splendor to kill Uruz, and Euedien.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;However, we do be usin a plan, remember.  The magicians sent their elementals into Rak to finish the fight.  All seemed well.  Rak was hurting, the elementals were winning.  Various talks ensued about how Rak doesn't gate, let alone summon, and how other long quests should be this easy.  Then it happened, the unthinkable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ninya cringed, &quot;Yes, it got a bit, umm, exciting.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lord Rak, after getting beaten to near death, used his magic to gate.  He healed, and summoned me to his resting place.  Reacting quickly, Me used my magic to imbue my feet with Spirit of the Cheetah, in the hopes of reaching the assembled force, but the door to the house was locked, and I didn't have the key.  There was also this little problem with the 4 skeletons and 4 army behemoths that didn't like what was happening to Rak.  I died at the locked door.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe that was the key you gave to me, bearhead!&quot; yelled Togam.<br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't get back to the locked door, I was with the main force,&quot; replied Gavan.<br>
<br>
&quot;And who knew Rak would gate?  Also, when you opened the door to help me, thinking you would just let me out, a world of hurt, everything the City could throw at us, descended on you and the force of Crimson Eternity, courtesy of my attempts to get out of the house!!!&quot;  Tanuden paused at this point, and took a swig of ale from the container.  He grimaced as his arm rose to bring the container to his lips.<br>
<br>
Sispis turned to Cisrab, &quot;Was our path this long?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope, and not this tough either.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eincro, thinking fast, summoned me with his magic back to the force.  Me arrived naked among a sea of corpses with the elementals still beating on Lord Rak.  Tilian and Gavan had brought the creatures of the city to their death at the hands of Crimson Eternity, and victory was again in our grasp.  But <br>
alas, nothing was typical here.  Lord Rak gated again, this time summoning Eincro to his death.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Again, Rak was brought to the force, in combat with only one elemental, and more heroes stepped up.  First Togam then Gavan and Khelder, seeing the elemental falter slightly, rushed into combat with Lord Rak.  Gavan died, but ultimately Rak met his doom, and his scale was taken to the spirit in the jungle.  The spirit gave me this stick with feathers on it...&quot;<br>
<br>
Tanuden jams the butt end of the Spear of Fate into the tundra.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and the path was finished.&quot;<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
A roar from the assembled mass cheered Heyokah Tanuden, partly for finishing his epic in 17 months, and partly for finishing this story which took the same amount of time.  Thanks to everyone for their assistance, whether it was advice or participation, because there is no way I could have finished this quest without a huge amount of help.  I am truly grateful and thankful for being a part of this guild, this server, and for having the friends and support I have today.<br>
<br>
As always good luck and good hunting.  <p>Tanuden <BR>

I am sedentary by nature, enjoying passive entertainment, eating when the mood takes me, and playing with my food. I try to avoid conflict, but when I'm angered, I can be a devil - if you force me to fight, I will crush you.
