But there's not much we can do.  Shaman DOT's blow ours away, clerics outnuke us (Rangers are getting a DD that will put them at same nuke level as Necros), Druid DOTs are in our range as well.  Not one of our POP spells was a upgrade in damage over our best DOT we have now.  Of course, it's so insanely rare it's not worth mentioning anyways.  SK's are also getting the same pet, and 3 DOTs that I'm using now.<br>
<br>
Dont forget to mention our jacked up resists which are so much worse after the last patch (nerf) its not even funny.  Last night in UP, I had debuffed mobs resist my debuff.  Then proceed to resist my root, my darkness (snare), ignite blood, insideous retro, plague, and CoC.  That was BLUE mobs, AFTER being debuffed.  The only thing I had that could hit them were my lifetap and my pet.  They tell us that we need to debuff them after last patch.. doesn't help a whole hell of a lot if your DEBUFF wont land AFTER it's been ALREADY been debuffed by a shaman/chanter.  But if you bitch about it, people say stop whining about your class and play another one if you want.  <br>
<br>
/shrug, I love playing my necro, I just wish VI would quit fvcking them over.  Unfortunately, the necro community isn't large enough to get anything changed by bitching about it so we've faced a steady stream of nerfs since the game came out.  Admittedly, we were overpowered then, but I think nerfing us got to be a habit instead of something that actually needed doing.  Is there another class who's DD spell at 44 does the exact amount of damage as their 55 nuke (only 510 damage)?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, lets get into AA skills, I can turn meat into bone chips, or spend 5 minutes farming them and get 5 stacks.  I also get MGB.. of course, my only group buff is group DMF.. oh yeah.. I dont think it's ever dropped on this server.  At level 56, my give mana to another ratio is still the same as it was 24.  My lich ratio is about the same as it's been since 20.  SK's (who we are the parent class of) have our best summon corpse.  I mean.. what the hell?<br>
<br>
Hate to admit it, but I'm leveling up a wizzie alt.  I mean, after all, lifeburn (all 3-4k of it MAX) would be unbalancing if it could stack.  Our max DOT (INSANELY RARE level 60 funeral pyre of Kelador) only does 2160 damage .. (by the way.. anyone here have it outside of Magister and the like?) yet a wizzie can nuke for 2k (much more with the  POP upgrade) without even critting.  Necro DOT's cant crit.. hell.. our DD's dont even crit.  I love my necro and will always keep him.. but I'm wondering if necros aren't being phazed out.<br>

It would seem, necros never get the same energy invested in them.  Just look at some of the points the AD necro brought up about the current state of necros.

<br>
EVERY class is bitching. Not just necros, but every class I've read so far. Sure, there's a few people who actually like what their class is getting, but for the most part, everywhere I look, it's b!tch, b!tch, b!tch...<br>
<br>
But, I have to take exception once again to Necros whining about SK's getting their spells...<br>
<br>
The &quot;uber&quot; Necro spells that we have now... suck. Most of them are useless in the high-end game. Hell, I only bother with a pet when group-mates want a laugh. So VI has two choices: give us spells that will actually be USEFUL, or remove them altogether. <br>
<br>
Being a hybrid, we're going to have some of your spells. And, we're going to have some of your GOOD spells. That's the way life is. BUT, are we going to have your BEST spells? No. When do we GET the 49 pet spell? Hmmm... 64th level? And you're having a cow over that? LOL.<br>
<br>
I even find it funnier that in the Necro bitch-thread, there is discussion about the SK pet you guys are getting. Tons of Necros sit there and ridicule SK's, and talk about how our spells suck, and how our melee sucks, etc, but then the same people turn around and BITCH when SK's are slated for upgrades. If you're one of those folks: EAD.<br>
<br>
SK's get your best summon corpse... well, I seem to recall you guys getting our improved FD. You don't like that trade? Well, in that trade, I will argue that Necros got the better end of the deal. <br>
<br>
All in all, I am not thrilled about the SK spells as they are listed so far. Personally, I'd rather have our melee skills improved instead of more spells added, but that's just me.<br>
<br>
But like someone else said: most of what you see is not set in stone. A lot of it is bound to change and be altered. When we have final lists, let's come back and revisit the topic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'll leave you with this question: What is a necro's purpose?  To give mana? Mages do it better.  To have good pets?  Mages have much better.  It surely isn't nukes since every <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> healing class</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> out there can outnuke us much less the other INT classes.  To summon corpses?  /shrug, SKs can do the same.  DOTs?  Nope shamans put us in the dust.  I'll tell you, except for a few group tap spells which they totally screwed over by making them not stack with spells that aren't even CLOSE to having similar spell effects, a necro's purpose is to solo low blues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaximusfaticus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maximus Faticus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/25/02 9:22:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3667.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE</span><hr size=1> Dalamarn, I use splurt, and EB on the mobs near the zone really.

Personally I don't care what Shadow Knights get, I don't play a SK.  If what you say is true though, I am happy that my friends will get some of our kick ass spells to play with.   Finally, it's been proven that necro's can give far more mana then a mage.  As for the other stuff...  We can Nuke, DoT, Snare, Root, Mez, Fear, FD, Tank (w/ pet), Twitch, Heal, and Buff.  We are the jack of all trades, master of none (when PoP comes out and lose our master of the DoT’s).  As for the soloing blues, I don't know about you but I can solo yellows.  <br>

You seem to be comparing the way necros are now to the way shadowknights will be at level 65. Of course that makes us seem like we are going 'through the roof'. I doubt you will still be using that level 49 pet at 65. But even it you are, you need to realize that necros and shadowknights use the same spells very differently. To a shadowknight, the pet is just a decent dot to use when soloing, and occasionally when grouped.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, there is no way to tell now how shadowknights will compare to warriors in melee skill. We don't know if shadowknights skill caps are raising to a warriors level (currently our skills cap MUCH lower), we don't know how or if the damage tables are changing for melee classes post 60, and we don't know what kind of warrior-only weapons will become available.<br>
<br>
I suggest that people take a wait-and-see approach to planes of power. It won't be coming out for another month, it won't be finished for at least two more months, and it won't be balanced for a few more months after that. Getting worked up about it now when we only know a small part of what PoP is going to be seems like a waste of time to me.<br>

I compared the 65 SKs to current necros  because PoP necro spells dont do more damage than the current ones.  Anyways, yeah.. I'll wait and see.. and I'm sure they'll fix it.  Just like they were going to fix that rest of the crap for the past 3 years. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaximusfaticus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maximus Faticus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 9:47:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3667.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the link Lurikeen <p><a href=http://www.michaelwhelan.com><img src=http://www.ordered-chaos.com/mark/Sig.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubulvyne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bulvyne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 333<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/27/02 2:57:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3667.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE</span><hr size=1> SK's should have better fd than Necros because it's simply a pulling tool: SK's pull when monks aren't present. I have yet to be on a single raid, ever, where a Necro pulled. To me, it just makes too much sense.<br>
<br>
Why are we getting better lifetaps? Because the ones we have now... suck? Because at 65th level, 280 point lifetaps which are resisted are going to be laughed at, and perhaps VI thought that we could use a decent one once we've gained a few more levels?<br>
<br>
Some of your BEST spells? Your 49th pet is one of your best spells? Hmmm.... again, we get that at 64th level. At 64th level, I seriously hope you will be using some other pet than your 49th level one. <br>
<br>
Melee skill enhancements? Have you seen something I haven't? I have not seen where our Offense and melee skill maxes will be raised. Lots of folks are assuming so, but how much? And yes, one or two of the &quot;melee AA's&quot; look really nice, but, are SK's getting them? I've heard yes, I've heard no. I've seen charts where only Warriors and Rogues and Monks get them, and I've seen posts stating that all melee get them. Time will tell on the &quot;melee upgrades&quot;, but knowing Verant, I am NOT holding my breath, or getting my hopes up.<br>
<br>
But &quot;bringing SK's up to our power in spell-casting&quot;... can you exagerate just a LITTLE bit more? Sk's will NEVER be &quot;up to a Necro&quot; in sheer-casting power. We will NEVER be up to a warrior in sheer melee ability - and that's the way it SHOULD be. We should be adept at both, but a master of neither.<br>
<br>
A Necro's purpose is what you make it. You can DOT like no one's business, you can make awesome pets. You can give mana. You can debilitate your target with various effects. You can mez to some extent, and you can heal. You sit there and list all these skills that you have, and then you spin them off to 8 different classes... which only shows how unique a Necro is: you can DO the things that all those different classes can do. Can a MAGE summon corpses? Can a SHAMAN give me mana? I suppose that your pets are worse than a druid's? <br>
<br>
And, the list of Necro utility spells is staggering: you can invis (so, most classes can, but not all), DMF, snares, Fear, and of course FD to save your butt in desperate situations, etc.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't think that ANY class has it &quot;as bad&quot; as they think they do, but that's just me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've always looked at bards, druids &amp; necros as different sides of the same thing.  They're all jack-of-all-trades type classes... it really comes down to the ability of the individual to play the different facets of the character well.  If dots don't work switch to heals.. if heals aren't needed switch to pumping... need a tank in a pinch pop out the pet.  They're wonderful like that and the best necros I've seen take full advantage of all the skills.<br>
<br>
The main drawback for jack-of-all-trade types is they tend to lack one class-defining ability.<br>
<br>
Each of these has something they are good at (though not really class defining): ports for druids, songs that increase group/raid efficiency.... not sure what necro ability would fit here, but maybe group utility stuff like lifetaps, mana xfer, etc.<br>

Yes, Necros have a lot of UTILITY spells.  We dont exactly heal.. we give OUR health.  As far as giving mana.. yeah, I can do that.  I can spend 400 of my mana to give you 150.  Someone with your hps and tanking ability is going to be BLOWN AWAY when you get bond of death and those taps to go with it.  <br>
<br>
You are getting the darkness spell that the necro community has been asking for FOREVER.  You are also getting the fast casting lifetap the necros have been asking for (upgrade to deflux).  You think you need faster casting times?  How would you like to have 1200 or so HPs and it take you 6 seconds to get a lifetap off.  How often do you think a mob is going to hit me in 6 seconds?  As I stated before, I dont have a problem with them upgrading Sk's.  I have a problem with them giving SKs (a hybrid of the necromancer class) better spells than their parent class.  AND your resists are better than DOUBLE ours.  Why does our tap have a resist of -200 and yours is faster and has a resist rate of -500?  I scream bullshit on this and will continue to.<br>
<br>
As far as pulling, there hasn't been one day I've played this game as a necro and not pulled something.  As most necros are forced into soloing situation, I'd say 90+% of them pull 100% of their mobs daily. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

Necros make some of the best pullers IG. We can both FD and DA pull.<br>

<br>
You have 1200 hps? /em bow in humility and reverence. =)<br>
<br>
6 seconds is a long time to get off a tap when under fire and it irks me too that SKs get Life Leech. However, 6 seconds isn't too long if my prey is darknessed. It is all over for them then. *cackles* <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=3667.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=3667.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3667.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=3667.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=3667.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3667.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3667.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
