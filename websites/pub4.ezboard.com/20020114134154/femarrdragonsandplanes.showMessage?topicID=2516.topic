I have never been so pissed in my life... or so disappointed in someones ethics.<br>
<br>
Brecht how fucking lame can you get?  Really?  You set up a raid, you dont have enough people so you tell everyone to get their friends... with the amount of people who showed we were pretty fucking desperate and we offered all the help we could find... you even ok'd clerics under 45 because, hey, we needed clerics pretty damn bad.  <br>
<br>
Then you wait over 2 hours to tell them that they are disqualified from loot rules?  I question this and Im totally brushed off... so I say "if this matter isnt addressed Im not staying"... everyone leaves chat and logs back on... I have several people sending tells telling me that only appropriate classes can roll for class specific items and Im telling them "THATS NOT THE ISSUE AT HAND"... then I have others telling me that "they are disqualified because other people wont have as many opportunities to raid Vox because they are higher levels" YES that makes sense... but when you call people in just to be able to make your raid possible WHY NOT TELL THEM BEFORE HAND!  YES I have little time to continue trying for these items because Im lvl 52 but does that make me think this is fair... NO!  Had they known they would have been disqualified and USED completely they would not have come and I would not have blamed them!  But instead you totally feel it is fair to tell them less than 5 minutes before we attack vox "by the way... you cant roll on any items" FUCK THAT<br>
<br>
Then to top it off... rather than discussing it or coming to a reasonable conclusion you ignore my questions, refuse to answer me, and weasle your ass out if it by saying "lets see what drops and discuss it later" next thing you know you're calling "CHARGE" before SEVERAL people are even grouped... then you STILL Have these same people busting thier asses because they're too decent to leave and leave their groups hanging and because of your POOR ASS LEADERSHIP SKILLS EVERYONE GETS WIPED OUT!  You didnt have the right people, you didnt have the right levels but if you hadnt been in such a god damned hurry we could have pulled it off... she was down to 10% health the second time I charged in but yet you had people sitting in the fucking buffhall twiddling their thumbs!<br>
<br>
WTF!  <br>
<br>
And Im not pissed we had a wipe out... Im pissed that you're a heartless bastard who would take advantage of people and then totally show no respect for the time they wasted trying to help you and everyone involved in your piece of shit pick up raid.  I am pissed that you had your head too far up your ass to make sure everyone was doing what they were supposed to do... pissed that you didnt even give the people involved A CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL... had you done a fairly decent job and we had a wipeout... I'd have blamed everyone involved... but the way I see it you just fucked over 40+ people because of your incompitance...<br>
<br>
and I'll tell you right now... THERE IS NO DAMN REASON IN THE WORLD WHY THAT MANY PEOPLE CANT KILL THAT DAMN DRAGON!<br>
<br>
SO YES... FUCK YOU<br>
<br>
And if Im digging myself into a huge fucking hole for defending people's honor who were dragged into your mess of what you call a raid then so be it... I seriously thing you are one of the biggest pieces of shit I have ever run across to totally fuck them over that way.<br>

<br>
Now... the corpse run took a long time... many many people lost a lot of experience, many corpses rotted, and tons were too old to res once they were made available... I myself had 3 corpses rot, 1 timed out, and 1 ressed... yay for me... Im so happy that I got my gear back I dont care that its going to take me a LONG time to get my lvl back.  Im not as pissed about the experience lost as I am pissed about the actions that caused so many people to have to stay up, the people who had no choice but to log and worry about it all later<br>
<br>
And yeah... I wasnt sure if you had logged off or if you had logged onto another character but point is I didnt see you after the tragic slaying of your team.  I was impressed with Siilverain and Sircrombattleaxe who spent their time coming to help out... I salute the necro who summoned our corpses... the clerics who stayed to res... and everyone else who helped out... I had planned to stay for the end but I lost my connection and I cant get back on.  (sorry)  Either way my point is... I think its wrong that you bailed... if you were there forgive me... your presence was not known to me or many others.<br>
<br>
Also... I think its pretty bad to brag that someone (one person) was playing 4 characters at one time for a raid... I dont see how this could be benefitial in any way... I see only negatives to this.  I have friends who play 2 characters at once proficiently... but I could never imagine them playing more than that... without making it hazardous to everyone involved.<br>
<br>
My first post was shitty, I was pissed, and I feel that I had a right to be.  I still do.  Perhaps you are able to lead a raid... but I have yet to see it happen.  I apologize for being so pissed off and perhaps out of line, but I hope you also see where Im coming from.<br>
<br>
And as for the characters who were told they could not roll for items... I was impressed HIGHLY by their patience, effort, and teamwork despite the fact that they were shitted on... and I applaud them.   <p><hr>

I had heard the flames were already raging...  I only want to point out a few small things...<br>
<br>
The first of which is that tonight's failed Vox raid was not a normal occurance.  Brecht has led over 40 Vox raids and has been sucessful at it up until this one.  I have NO idea what happened with tonight raid, other than to say that we had many that had not done it before, we were short a few clerics, heavy on the druids and lacking in the Enchie and Shaman department.  <br>
<br>
As for the call of CHARGE...It was getting late..many people had signed up for a Vox/Nagafen double header and I'm sure the pressure was on for us to get Vox done.  <br>
<br>
The raid did not go very well....period...a lot of death, one of which was not the intended Lady Vox.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER...In all of this, try and find the good points...<br>
<br>
We saw so many people that were there till the end, just to help.  So much pp was donated for CR....many people died several MORE times trying to get our corpses out of Vox's lair...The majority of the folks there, stayed and hung in there for the long haul and in the end, I heard something repeated several times..&quot;It didn't go as planned, but I met some neat people&quot; or &quot;but I had fun anyhow&quot;...<br>
<br>
Does just charging in, taking down an NPC and rolling on the loot really leave you with as much as coming together with your fellow players to help when things DON'T go right?  I ran into some old friends tonight that I hadn't seen in ages.  I had some laughs.  I lost about 2 bubs of experience which is nothing in comparison to my guildmate who got caught in a death loop and must have lost at least two levels.  <br>
<br>
The only other thing I wanted to comment on was this...<br>
<br>
The person playing 4 characters did not brag about doing so.  That was mentioned by somebody else entirely.  That person has saved my arse with those four characters on more than one occasion and we've had a lot of hours of fun-filled-multiple-personality groupage in which I wondered how it was done and admired the person doing it for doing it so well.  <br>
<br>
The person that was playing those four characters also was not doing it in hopes of getting some uber loot...It was simply because of a need.  A need for a cleric, a need for an enchanter and a need for a monk.  <br>
<br>
In the end I was proud to say I lasted as long as I did.  I was only there to see my brother in song, Brecht Bertolt, lead his last Vox raid before leveling and going on to bigger and hopefully better things.  I cannot speak for how he felt, but I know that I would have been terribly upset if I had been in his shoes.  <br>
<br>
Brecht, I'm sorry your last as a leader wasn't better, but I'm glad I got to be there with you.  <br>

Ok i made that up, but really, everyone seems to brag about all the times they killed the old world dragons, some of you have to be straight liars. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uguildon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guildon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/9/01 9:03:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;I have NO idea what happened with tonight raid, other than to say that we had many that had not done it before, we were short a few clerics, heavy on the druids and lacking in the Enchie and Shaman department. &quot;<br>
<br>
In that sentence you clearly explained why the raid failed. <br>
<br>
No Shaman equals no tuna which is 350+ hps, no sta, no str, no agi, no dex<br>
No ench = no haste cept for bards no clarity cept for bards and if the bard dies well you are in trouble.<br>
Lacking in clerics = no cheals<br>
Druids at that level just don't have the healing power <br>

<br>
Didn't say there were none...just low on them...<br>
<br>
Bards don't sing haste while killing Vox.<br>
Clerics never CHeal of any kind<br>
<br>
Things didn't go well.  It happens.  <br>
<br>
As for playing four accounts...<br>
<br>
Ask yourself....Could we have gotten through the CR without them?  Was one of them not one of the few enchanters we had?  Was another not one of the few clerics we had?<br>
<br>
We gave it our best with what we had to work with folks.  Many donated for coffins, many ported, many waited....<br>
<br>
I think it could have been a lot worse and people could have been left with corpses in Vox's lair with no way to get them out...However, that did not happen.  <br>
<br>
Again, THANK YOU to all that stuck it out and came to help and sacrificed sleep and sanity.  You will not be forgotten.<br>

<br>
Hmm I suppose so but then they are suppose to be using mana no? <br>
<br>
Clerics never cheal hmm that's a new one to me.<br>
I'm not one to criticize so I'll just say that the results seem to have justified the method.<br>

<br>
remember, there was a time when we didn't use it either.  we used ae heals for vox/nags.<br>
<br>
it took a bit of practice with a stable group of people to become advanced enough to use cheals because everyone got to know who was capable of withstanding the attack long enough to get one off.<br>
<br>
pick up raids often lack that advantage because they always have different people of different dragon fighting experience levels.<br>
<br>
just a thought though.<br>

This was my first Vox raid.  All I know is that it seemed a pretty sound statement that &quot;CHeal will draw WAY TOO MUCH aggro&quot;...<br>
<br>
As for mana, we only sang that during IG's and buffline.  Other than that, it was a drum and guardian/elemental...period.  <br>
<br>
I was suprised I lived as long as I did.  <br>
<br>
I enjoyed myself.  Why?  Because I learned a lot.  I was educated last night.  Next time, I will go knowing a little bit more than I did the last...<br>

Draws ubah agro and makes things messy.  They are normaly informed to stick to Sup. Heals.<br>
<br>
Any Vox raid with a lack of chanters should be scraped.  It is nearly impossible to kill her fast enough to prevent Cheal and a wipe out from what I have seen.<br>
<br>
This sounds like a classic Mini-Dragon raid....Loot mongering, death, and people pissed off =P <p>Denied, 55 chanter,
