<br>
As posters above have pointed out, invaders and settlers have been going backwards and forwards across this area of land for a long time now from well before recorded history I am sure. Which is why for any side to claim they were there first is silly. <br>
<br>
Israel/Palestine, like Ireland/Northern Ireland, Yugoslavia and other places where politicians have tried to artifically create borders following a war have all resulted in disaster since they never really investigate the true situation. <br>
<br>
But, if we marked a piece of map with "Palestine" another with "Israel" drew some lines on the ground put both sides on their respective sides.. would the violence actually stop ?<br>
<br>
I just think it is ironic, that Israel which had to be artificially created to give the Jews a homeland following WWI are the last country willing to recognise that the Palestinians would like a homeland also. <br>
<br>
Also wonder what would happen if the USA withdrew military support for Israel.. or the ex-soviets for the Arabs under normal survival of the fittest wouldn't they have resolved this finally one way or the other ages ago ?<br>
<br>
I suspect that like Ireland they will continue to take potshots at each other forever since there's always someone who remembers someone who was killed by the otherside, so the violence never ends. <br>
<br>
Hard to imagine the state they get whipped into by their leaders where supposedly sane people think that gelignite underpants are the best way to promote your cause. <br>

<br>
For example...<br>
<br>
Caoilfhionn stated a whole bunch of facts about the occupation of the area.  I could be wrong, but I understand that most of that information came from the bible?  So, I could step in here and say &quot;Well, you must be wrong.  Because *I* believe that the bible is the biggest hoax the world has ever seen&quot;, in which case, Caoilfhionn would probably get really angry.  At which point, it becomes a circular argument.  Who is right?  Who is wrong?  Who knows?<br>

<br>
I think kani basically summed it up.  The land was considered worthless and was basically uninhabited till the israelis came after the war and started to make something of it.  Jews and the inhabitants of the time actually worked together to make the land worth something.  Bottom line is the land wasnt worth shit till the Jews came back.  How are they opposed to the same rights for the Palestinians?  In the many wars they've won, they've acquired land and given a mindboggling amount of that land back.  Frankly...most Palestinians dont want peace.   Being Jewish a lot of what i say may be biased, but the Palestinians dont want peace, and their actions have merely proven this.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;And for that matter why do organisations like the PLO &gt;&gt;&gt;think that the best way for Israel to become their friend &gt;&gt;&gt;is to send nutbags with 1000kg of explosive strapped to &gt;&gt;&gt;their genitals into a crowded restaraunt ? <br>
<br>
Once again, peace isn't their goal.  I believe arafat even stated publicly when asked how much land it would take to stop the violence that it wouldnt stop till they had all of it.  The prime minister of the country doesnt want peace, the people arent very much different...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;As posters above have pointed out, invaders and settlers &gt;&gt;&gt;have been going backwards and forwards across this area &gt;&gt;&gt;of land for a long time now from well before recorded &gt;&gt;&gt;history I am sure. Which is why for any side to claim they &gt;&gt;&gt;were there first is silly. <br>
<br>
This is true, however just about every old civilization has died out yet the Jews are the one that has remained for thousands of years, so when you think about it the land really does belong to them.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I just think it is ironic, that Israel which had to be &gt;&gt;&gt;artificially created to give the Jews a homeland following &gt;&gt;&gt;WWI are the last country willing to recognise that the &gt;&gt;&gt;Palestinians would like a homeland also. <br>
<br>
I believe israel was created post WWII firstly.  Secondly, Palestinians have many places they could go and be safe, Jews dont.  Israel was created to be a Jewish homeland, but it's more of a safehaven from persecution.  Everywhere the Jews ever went they were forced to flee because of this persecution, but when one has a home this isn't the case.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also wonder what would happen if the USA withdrew &gt;&gt;&gt;military support for Israel.. or the ex-soviets for the Arabs &gt;&gt;&gt;under normal survival of the fittest wouldn't they have &gt;&gt;&gt;resolved this finally one way or the other ages ago ?<br>
<br>
I think the only reason USA doesnt withdraw is most likely worldwide opinion and that Israel is one of last democratic country in the middle east.<br>
<br>
Well that's just my opinion, and it may seem biased but many people that have posted are coming from the point of view of one who only knows what they see on the news, and the news is completely slanted.<br>

<br>
As for the nation being artificially created, the land was under contest while under British rule.  Unrest was between the Jews &amp; the Arabs. In 1948 the land was split between Israel &amp; Palestine in accordance with UN vote in 1947 after Britain proposed the issue be placed on the agenda, as they were no longer able, nor wished to control the opposing factions. They didn't just force a bunch of people out and move all the Jews in.  One day later the State of Israel was attacked by FIVE different countries.  A fledgling nation with no formal military, and they repulsed the attackers, later signing peace agreements with the majority of them.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, these peace agreements were consistently broken, not by Israel, but by the opposing nations, including Egypt.  Their trade routes were blocked, and in 1967, this eventually resulted in the six-day war where Egypt, after allowing trade routes open, shut them down again.  Egypt, Syria &amp; Jordan allied, surrounding Israel on all fronts with hostile forces.  Israel invoked an inherent right of self-defense, launched a pre-emptive strike on all fronts and in the end, wound up with control of the entire area.  Jerusalem was once again under total Israel control.<br>
<br>
Propaganda would have you believe that the Palestenians in the previously Jordan held sector were forced from their homes, but they were given the option of remaining and becoming Israeli citizens.  Barring that, they were also giving the option of NOT becoming citizens, but given the option to vote for the leadership in the area.  <br>
<br>
You think the Israeli's don't want peace?  They LONG for it.  However, dealing with neighbors whose credo is &quot;no peace with Israel, no negotiations with Israel and no recognition of Israel&quot;, what would you have them do?<br>
<br>
Let their children and citizens be murdered, while they stand by and do nothing?  They aren't sanctioning civilian attacks.  Israeli soldiers have standing orders to NOT shoot children, yet Palestine pays parents to send their children to the frontline, bribing them.  And that's the first thing you see splashed across the newspaper...<br>
<br>
Everyone wants to come in here and spout their opinion, when they know NOTHING about what is happening, has happened and what they'd like to happen.  I'm more than happy to debate what is happening over there, but before I'm willing to do that, you have to get past the argument that they are somehow squatters on this land.  <br>
<br>
I guess we should go yank the reservations from the Native Americans in the USA, because goddamn, we took it from them, why the hell did we give it back?<br>
<br>
As I pointed out previously in this thread, the media drives the prevailing opinion.  I'd just like to point out that Israel is under heavy attack, for gods sake a man just walked into a Sbarro's and killed 15 people, including children.  Do you really think they should just sit back and do nothing.  The Arabs will use any tactic they feel is justified, regardless who it kills.  And Israel will continue to defend it's home.  <br>
<br>
I've had this discussion numerous times.  I can back myself up with documents, undisputed fact.  I don't go goose-stepping to what I'm told or read, I'm smart enough to figure the story out for myself.  Can you? <p>Caoilfhionn aka Carrot <BR<

Well, well, well.  I guess we got to hear the Jewish standpoint on this, didn't we?  Thank you Caoilfhionn, for elightening us with your more then biased opinion on this situation.<br>
<br>
Now to some good-ol-fashion post-dissecting.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>722-720BC - Israel crushed by Assyrians.<br>
</font color><br>
That was when Jews lost their major power of Israel.  You can go ahead and count the years between then, and 1948.  Afterward, post it up, it will be an interesting number.  Who's fault is it that the Israelis were crushed by the Assyrians in a time of world conquest?  Obviously the Israelis.<br>
<br>
Now remember, conquest is good right?  America wouldn't be here without conquest.  Think about it.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow><i>Caoilfhionn digresses in her timeline about how the Jews immigrated back to Palestine, built communities outside of Jerusalem....you know, the same type of thing that happened world wide in other countries that were obtained in conquest.  The losers miss what they lost.</i></font color><br>
<br>
Who said during those years, when world conquest was STILL taking place, that the Jews couldn't go take over Canada?  Or Argentina?  Oh sorry, technology deemed that impossible back then.  Maybe something closer, like maybe Ivory Coast, Africa?  Any part of Russia?  India?  They lost to the Assyrians.  Tough.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>As for the nation being artificially created, the land was under contest while under British rule. Unrest was between the Jews & the Arabs. </font color><br>
<br>
Keep note that there were a lot more Arabs, then there were Jews.  A LOT more.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>They didn't just force a bunch of people out and move all the Jews in. </font color><br>
<br>
See, this is something that is clouded by World War II.  Back in the 40s, everyone was crushed by what happened to the Jews in Europe.  Now, that was indeed very tragic, and a very VERY dark time in World History.  Words cannot describe how unfortunate it was for what Hitler did.<br>
<br>
But lets put that aside, because that has zero to do with Palestine.  Zero.  Of course, the world was mourning the loss of the Jews who died during WWII, and therefore, didn't pay attention to Arabs being thrown into their own backyards, forced to eat their own shit, Arab women being raped, and Arabs in some cases being exiled out of their homes altogether.  This didn't happen?  Bull-fucking-shit.  Britain saying its alright to move into other people's homes doesn't excuse moving into other people's homes.  It happened, and that is pure fact.  But people won't think about this small detail, because remember....millions of Jews just died in Europe, and that excuses everything.  Right?<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Propaganda would have you believe that the Palestenians in the previously Jordan held sector were forced from their homes, but they were given the option of remaining and becoming Israeli citizens. Barring that, they were also giving the option of NOT becoming citizens, but given the option to vote for the leadership in the area. </font color><br>
<br>
I love this one.  Read your post.  You state that they had options of becoming Israeli citizens, or the option to vote for the leadership.  Who was giving them this option?  Israelis?  The U.N.?  This was Jordan/Arab land.  They don't need options.  It's their land, its their home.  No one should be giving them options.  It's fuck-stick statements like that which make me sick.  "Mexico, we are taking you over, but we're giving you the option to either suck our cocks, or bend over and take it in the ass.  It's your choice....see how nice we are?

<br>
<font color=yellow>You think the Israeli's don't want peace? They LONG for it. However, dealing with neighbors whose credo is "no peace with Israel, no negotiations with Israel and no recognition of Israel", what would you have them do?</font color><br>
<br>
It's not the Jews land, and no, I won't be a coward and rest on that fact alone.  The World War's should have proven one thing to people.  The time of conquest is now gone.  You don't see America trying to move in on Canada.  You don't see the Germans trying to take over Paris.  After World War II, it was obvious that conquest was over.  You had so many powerful countries that were against war, and against land-expansion, including the United States.  Back in 700 B.C.E. (which is the now correct term, not B.C.) conquest was strong.  The Israelis are looking that far back as their reason why this land should be theirs.  Think OUTSIDE of the box for a second, and try to hold an unbiased opinion.  Should the Israeli's have the land the Assyrians won in the World Domination game 2-3 thousand years ago?  The answer that makes sense is, no.  Just like the Native Americans shouldn't have the entire United States back for their own.  Back then, it was survival of the fittest.  It no longer is anymore, and wasn't in 1948.  Land that was primarily Arab was created into Israel, a land under Jewish rule.  That may not have been wrong Before the Common Era, or even up to the 1700s, but it is wrong now, and was wrong in 1948.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow><i>Caoilfhionn continues on in her post, discussing battles, the media, the Arab nations breaking treaties, breaking rules, etc....basically just a bunch of crap.</i></font color><br>

Now that I have gotten that off my chest, lets discuss the current situation. It is always unfortunate when people have to die, whether it is child or adult.  I wish Israel would do the right thing so people wouldn't have to die.  Prime Minister...um, whoever it is now.....do the right thing.  Give the land back to the Palestinians, and move on.  Thank you.<br>

I'm sure my opinion seeped thru in some places, it's hard not to post without any of your opinion seeping thru, but for what its worth, I wish they would stop all of the violence over there.<br>
<br>
You can wish that Israel would just pack up and scatter to the four winds, but it's not going to happen.  We can debate for hours who's right and who's wrong, but in the end, I'm not an Israelite.  I don't live there, I'm not a citizen.  I don't vote there, and I have no control over what is occurring in the middle east.<br>
<br>
If the Palestinians wanted to strengthen their position, sending suicide bombers into civilian areas and killing children isn't going to do it.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, if you want to address the post, it'd be better if you did it in a less hostile manner.  As it is, your opinion means jackshit to me, dickmunch, and I could care less if you want to spout your vomit for all the world to see.  <br>

Being that I am of middle-eastern heritage, I will admit that my opinion is scattered all over my post.<br>
<br>
Also, being that I am of middle-eastern heritage, I believe that I carry more knowledge in not only what is happenening over there, but how it is effecting families and people.  You may not care about my opinion, but its educated.<br>
<br>
Have whats going on over there effect your real life, then you will realize where my anger comes from.  However, I didn't let that cloud the facts I posted.  Israel lost the land over 2 thousand years ago, and they think its ok to have it back now.  That is wrong, and thats the bottom line.<br>
<br>
It is also unfortunate, that peace won't occur until one of the two countries does something drastic.  I don't appreciate war, and I don't appreciate death, but war will ensue, and people are going to die before this one is over.  The arabs do not consider Israel as being a country, and they never will.  People are going to continue to die until Israel does something major, like split the entire land in half, or give a majority to the Palestinians.<br>
<br>
Until that happens, its the Jews fault, and Israel's fault that people are dying.  It doesn't help that the United States is funding their military and backing them up in virtually every other way, either.<br>

They aren't going to leave.  <br>
<br>
Of course I'm going to be sympathetic to the Jewish side, I'm Jewish after all, but lets go so far and say I posted a totally one-sided view filled with nothing but fabricated facts from the Jewish side (which I don't think I did, but hey, maybe I did, whatever), what's the difference between my post and ...yours for instance?<br>
<br>
You posted your middle east views, quite obviously slanted to the Palestinian view....in a pretty hostile manner, matter of fact.<br>
<br>
As for how close it hits home, I have family there. I'm not a citizen of that country (unless you count from a religious standpoint) and I have no intention of becoming one.  I'm a lax Jew at best.  But everytime something like this happens, I have to wonder if I lost a cousin, or an aunt.  My mother and her siblings, some of whom are quite devout, like to call and keep me up on what's going on.<br>
<br>
If you are so knowledgeable on the situation over there, you'd be able to admit to yourself that they aren't leaving.  You might want them to, but be honest with yourself, short of the palestinians throwing them out, which won't happen, they aren't going.  You don't have to believe it's their home, THEY DO.  <br>
<br>
The problem here is both sides believe they are the righteous side.  Neither will give any quarter whatsoever, and so this situation will not go away until one side or the other is conquered.  <br>

<br>
This is one of the most ignorant and simplistic statements I've ever heard.<br>
<br>
Post WWII consider the USSR and Eastern Europe, China and Tibet, Syria and Lebenon... and countless other examples.  Bosnia and Kuwait are exceptioins, not the rule. <br>
<br>
Social Justice is a complex issue, and international politics has much more to do with the law of the jungle than 'moral right vs. wrong'.<br>
<br>
People are still motivated by the same desires as they were 10, 100, or 1000 years ago.  Greed, lust for power - these are the things that motivate the individuals who weald power in most nations.  For the most part, it has been shown that the only way to limit this avrice is to limit the power of any single individual.  Despotic rule works fine when you have a good ruler, however it is impossible to guarantee the character of someone before they come to power.<br>

<br>
First, I would like to apologize for my hostility.  This is a situation that is a lot more serious then anything that could ever happen in Everquest, or anything else people usually rant about here.<br>
<br>
I have had this argument with many people before, and I admit that people can see it from many sides.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, (and this isn't meant to be a flame toward Jews or people who back Israel) the argument always ends up with two major points on each side.<br>
<br>
On the Palestinian/Arab side, it is that the land isn't Israel's.  The Land belongs to the arabs, and the Jews are taking the land away from them.<br>
<br>
On the Israeli/Jewish side, its that &quot;Israel is striving for peace, and has given major allowances to the Palestinians as far as land, and power goes.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is almost as if Israel is doing the Palestinians favors.  That is probably the single most disturbing aspect of this all.  The Israelis are striving for peace, but the end result is that the country belongs to them, which is the entire problem altogether.<br>
<br>
The Palestinians have stated that they only want a piece of the land.  They aren't even asking for the entire country back.  So the Palestinians are believing they are doing a favor for the Jews and letting them keep some of the arab land for themselves.<br>
<br>
This may be beating a dead horse, but if you look at it from the way I presented it above, it seems clear (to me anyway) who is in the right, and who is in the wrong.<br>
<br>
I believe, the best way to end violence, is for Israel to give the land the Palestinians have always asked for, which isn't all of the land.  I think this is very fair, and if the Israelis living there don't begin thwarts of violence after this, the Palestinians will then have some sort of respect for the Jews.<br>
<br>
I pray for that day.<br>
<br>
It may be just how I see the world, and it may be because of how I feel on the subject, but its hard for me to see how Israel could say it is their home, and not the Palestinian's home.  To those living there, they were born there, they grew up there, yes, it is home to those Jews.  But on the political side, it is not Israel's home.  I hate the fact that it is this way, but 50 years of this bullshit is just going to make tensions higher...and higher....and worse.  Things are only going to get worse.  I really think that Israel should consider giving the land asked for by the arabs to them.<br>
<br>
Obviously what is happening now, isn't working.<br>

<br>
I can indeed elaborate but I fear most of it would be too profound for this &quot;gaming site board&quot;.<br>
<br>
For starters, there hasn't &quot;always has been&quot; an Israel. You are talking post-Balfour times i.e post-1948 here. Sure, the Israeli's have made great strides in various fields, but at what cost? For millennia...not days, weeks or months, but millennia, the Hebrews and Arabs and other Semitic folks have co-existed in the Levant. Suddenly, the Hebrews, and members of the Judaic religion in general are shown favouritism and given a &quot;homeland&quot;. At the cost of thousands of lives, Arab, Hebrew and otherwise, all over a European exercise in border-changing and map drawing. Africa in the 1800's in another prime example of creative cartography.<br>
<br>
Let's look at history a bit. The Hebrews, a Semitic tribe, were surrounded by nations of greater cultural awareness...did the Hebrews contribute in the fields of mathematics, governmental practice, philosophy like the Greeks? Did they contribute to running water, sanitation, diplomatic practices like the Romans? <br>
<br>
Did they allow for religious tolerance of other faiths like the Seljuks, Mamelukes and Ottomans did for them? Hell no, they preached a near-racist form of exclusivity. At least the Turks left them alone in this regard. <br>
<br>
Hell, their own alphabet is derived from the same Phillistines that invaded them, yet Phillistine today is a term for an uncultured boor. Phillistine = Phoenician for those who don't know...and their script is derived from cuneiform. Cuneiform came from the Sumerians who existed in an advanced social state millennia before Abraham tried to slice his son up.<br>
<br>
In effect, Israel's learning today is a syncresis of everything and everyone that has ever conquered them. They're not alone here, but do some serious study of FACT before making a statement like &quot; Israel is currently and has always been ahead of most others technology-wise.&quot;<br>
<br>
/sigh No decent or rational argument over Israel's right to exist as a homeland for the Jews will ever happen while they remain of the &quot;sensitive protected species&quot; list. You try talking about Israel without the word &quot;Nazi&quot; or the imprecise and ridiculous term &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; come up? Nope, can't do it.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid I'm gonna go over the heads of a few people here too, but let me ask you this...if the Hebrews/Jews get a homeland, why not the Kurds? Abdullah Ocalan asked that question...shame Saladin never did 700 or so years ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umiblis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miblis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/10/01 3:43:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2243.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All I can say is...</span><hr size=1> Todesgeliebter:<br>

<font color=yellow>This is one of the most ignorant and simplistic statements I've ever heard.</font color><br>
<br>
You are correct, there are still countries out there who carry zero sense in their acts, and have no real thought behind their actions.<br>
<br>
However, because of Big-Brother United States, and the United Nations, in all places except those under Communist Rule (and that is changing as we speak), countries just cannot do that anymore.  There is very little chance they can succeed, that that time in history is finished.  If the United States wanted to take Canada, they could take Canada.  But they don't.  And they are a force to be reckoned with.  When Big-Brother UN steps in and gives someone elses country to another group, that invites strife.  It invites war and destruction.<br>
<br>
My point was not that countries still don't want to conquer, it was that conquering is no longer a smart move, because there is little chance of success.  That would mean, that this part of our history, at the present time, is over.<br>

<br>
I find it very enlightening.<br>
<br>
And so, I wish to ask a couple of questions of those better informed and in-tune to the issues than I.<br>
<br>
What faction of Islam is followed by the Palestinians?  Are there any scriptural or theological (exact references if you can please) writings or canon regarding this kind of issue?<br>
<br>
You who are in touch with this issue, may I ask how big a role in this issue is politics, and how big a role is religion?<br>
<br>
Regarding the &quot;Age of Conquest&quot; being past.  Is not the setup of puppet states ( la the division of Germany and the subsequent puppeteering by the US and USSR) a modern-day PC method of conquest?  If so, does that not imply that archetypical conquest will be the final outcome of this situation (if indeed a final outcome exists)?<br>
<br>
Thanks much, and I will continue to follow your views,<br>

<font color=yellow>miblis why are you angry and mad with cao?<br>
<br>
is this your first little adventure out into the world of flaming people? pretty pathetic if you ask me. </font color><br>
<br>
This was your first post toward me.  This was un-related to the subject at hand.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>funny how you think using assorted swears makes your post into a 'flame'. ooh the dig dog of flamage has spoken! he called me a fuckstick!<br>
<br>
I see no need to argue with you. the anger and childish behavior you display in your post more then makes you look like a total idiot.<br>
<br>
yeah go ahead post another post with some snappy verbiage you festering asswart.</font color><br>
<br>
This was your second post toward me.  This is un-related to the subject at hand.<br>
<br>
So, you indeed, did not stay on the subject when addressing my posts.  I hope you feel like an idiot now.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>instead you found the first jew you could and tore into them</font color><br>
<br>
No, actually, I found the first person who gave a strong enough argument that I needed to respond to.  I am not against Jews.  I don't dislike people because of their views.  However, this is a rant board.  You rant here.  If you don't like someone's views, you rant.  This board is filled with verbal attacks about this, about that, etc.  Personally, I don't find that being KS'd, or having my uber-mob stolen is so incredibly important to me that I should waste my time writing a rant which will accomplish nothing to begin with.<br>
<br>
This issue is a serious issue.  If I disagree with someone, and it is on a board designed for no-holds barred verbal rampage, I will post.  Maybe I will change someone's opinion.  Maybe not.<br>
<br>
Now if Caoilfhionn dislikes me because of my views, and my verbal attacks (which remember, is what a rant-board is for), then that is her choice.  I was big enough to step back after my initial rage and realize I was way too harsh.  I was also big enough to re-read her post on a calmer note and see that I didn't need to be so hostile.<br>
<br>
That is why I apologized.<br>
<br>
I don't owe you any apology Kanibaal.  If you would like to drop your vendetta against me so we can discuss this real-life issue, thats fine with me.  If you want to reply with some ignoramous wish-wash, then so be it.<br>

It is romantic legend for the Arab peoples but has no factual basis. Therefore, calling what's attributed to Ishmael a prophecy is a little far fetched. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
