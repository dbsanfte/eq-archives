In fact, the clear teaching of the Bible states that man was created fully mature about six thousand years ago. (Genesis 1)<br><br>PEOPLE OFTEN ASK HOW THE 6000 YEARS IS DETERMINED. <br><br>No one Bible scripture states this and perhaps this is because God knew that man has been known to attempt to explain away any one particular scripture. The 6000 years is determined by adding the total chronological time span of the Biblical patriarchs to the date of established historical events such as the birth of Christ.<br><br>Some say that the genealogy of the patriarchs contain gaps. They claim that generations might be missing because each descendent listed in Genesis may not have been a son but rather a grandson or great grandson etc. This possibility is irrelevant because the time span between these births is mathematically fixed no matter how many generations may have been missing. <br><br>All the time lines of the stated genealogies link together to form an accurate continuous chronology. <br><br>Several textual discrepancies have arisen between the Greek Septuagint and the Hebrew Masoretic texts. These only amount to several hundred years therefore, the 6000 years+ recorded history of man stands. There is no rational way to stretch this figure to millions of years!<br><br>Evolutionists, including those who teach at many Christian colleges, believe that man is simply a higher form of ape who evolved by chance. According to this popular theory, the genus &quot;Homo&quot; has been evolving for about 2,500,000 years. <br><br>Page 5<br> Now this hypothesis can be mathematically tested and compared with the account of creation to establish which is more plausible. We need only compare the quantity of physical remains of man found on the planet Earth with the expected numbers which should remain as fossils or unfossilized bones. After all, the evolutionists have assured us that fossils, in general, have been preserved for hundreds of millions of years. <br>The equation for human population growth is: <br><br>P= poert<br><br>P = present human population<br>po = initial human population of 2 people<br>e = natural logarithm base (2.71<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>r = annual growth rate<br>t = time in years<br><br>The current annual growth rate is 1.7%. However, examination of population figures throughout recorded history, which takes into account plagues and wars, indicate that the average growth rate is closer to .5%. Now let's be extremely conservative and not even consider all the expected remains which would have accumulated from Homo erectus and Homo habilis which supposedly have been reproducing for several million years. We are also going to severely limit the calculation to the expected number of graves which modern man would have left, and then for ONLY 100,000 years instead of the 200,000 years proposed by many evolutionists. Going further, the population growth rate will be reduced to .1%.<br><br>Using these extremely conservative numbers in the above equation yields the Earths total population of Homo sapiens which would have lived and died :<br><br>5.3(10)43<br><br>This number is 5 with 43 zeros after it. This population is a whopping incomprehensible, <br><br>Page 6<br> <br><br> <br><br>astronomical number! Let me boil this down to the expected number of graves (remains/fossils) per acre. <br>NUMBER OF ACRES ON THE EARTH<br>3.7(10)10 <br><br>Each acre of ground should contain 1.44(10)33 bodies per acre <br><br>If the evolutionary scenario is even remotely true then:<br><br>Every time and every where a spade is put in the ground, it should come up filled with modern human bones!<br><br>As a matter of fact, no matter how deep the excavation or how many miles you probed the Earth with a test boring--you would come up with human remains. Remember this does not even include the entire genus &quot;Homo&quot; whose remains could not be contained in the entire globe of the Earth even if it were hollow.<br><br>Page 7<br> BIBLICAL SCENARIO:<br>We are now in a position to compare this unrealistic situation with the clear teaching of the Bible. <br><br>Initial Population after the flood: 8 people<br>Growth rate : .428%<br>Time: 4750 years (since the Flood)<br><br>EXPECTED EARTHS POPULATION:<br>5.38(10)9 <br><br>As you can see, this figure agrees with the current population of our planet (see graph). It is clear that the population growth figures are undeniably in accord with the Biblical account of Noahs flood as opposed to the utter foolishness of evolution theory. <br><br>Credits: Mr. John Heffner<br>Chairman, Math Dept.,Kilgore H.S., Kilgore,Tx.<br><br>Page 8<br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Page 9<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br> <br><br>Sal Giardina and his wife, Pam have a very unique and informative ministry of sharing truths regarding the Biblical creation.

That not even taking into account the billions of cubic feet of water that they can disperse in... and the thousands of feet of the earth's crust that is constantly created and destroyed by plate tectonics. Add the fact that dust is spread throughout the earth's atmosphere (again, billions of cubic feet surrounding the earth out to a radius of many miles), and the idea that every single human-type creature that has ever lived has a &quot;gravesite&quot; is idiotic at best.<br><br>Plus I always thought it was laughable that if there were 8 people left after this &quot;flood&quot; *chuckle* humans would have died out as a species a looooooong time ago. No biodiversity. First plague that came about would be the end. That simple.

That being said I do agree with your contention that &quot;bad science used to manipulate numbers does not &quot; mean the end results are accurate. Yet I see no scientific or mathmatical evidence from anyone that this formula and its end results are wrong. Just saying its &quot;bad science&quot; and that numbers are being &quot;manipulate&quot; does not prove your point.<br><br>Secondly the growth was aveaged out to approx .5% takening into account all the variables that cause populations growth to accerate and slow. In fact they even reduce the possible aveage growth rate to .1% to use the lowest (and propable too low) rate to account for all the plagues and wars.<br>Its true that year by year population growth is different its also true that you can get a fair aveage over a long period of time of a population growth rate.<br><br>I believe his term of graves was a term he used to refer to a man's reminds that should have been found. The trouble with that number is he doesnt' back it up with any type of proof or reasoning to come up with it.<br><br>The point of this mathmatical formula does beg the question where are all the fossil remains proving evolution. Why is there missing links in the evolution trail. If it is a very slow process that takes place of millions of years then we should find at least one fossil remain of each missing link. The odds that out of all of the million members of some links that not one of them have been fossilize tends to IMHO require more belief in a fairy tale then the fact that a higher power create life on Earth.<br><br>Finally some food for thought. Creationist believe that God create the heavens and life on earth. I believe that also but the evidence that other types of man existed before is clearly there. Maybe God had to create Homo-A (sorry not up on the scientific names) to be able to alter his genetics to create Homo-B to be able to alter his genetics to create Homo-C and so on and so on til he got to the end product of Homosapiens. In the end he still create mankind and we weren't just a random product of the evolution theory.<br><br>Is this possible? Sure today we are altering the genetics of food to make it a better product. Corn or tomato's etc. Would anyone argue that the corn evolve on its own without the help of a higher being creating the new corn? Of course not, but does this fit the evolution theory? Sure does. Is there a missing link between Corn-A and SuperCorn nope? If mankind disappear today and 6000 years from now would a new race be arguring wether the corn was created or naturally evolve and one day we will find the missing link?<br><br>I bet they would.<br><br>Jesman <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukdor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kdor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/25/02 1:12:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> People would be so closely related to each other that they would be genetic freaks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Have you SEEN some of these people on Lanys?<br><br>Ok, Ok.

I know, most of you may think that is proven, but examine those models and it doesnt hold water either.  Throughout the evolutionary process of modern man, there have been periods of near extinction many times.  Which if during any one episode reduced the population to a few tens of thousands, that would but the breaks on any population growth up until that time, and it would be like starting in first gear again.
