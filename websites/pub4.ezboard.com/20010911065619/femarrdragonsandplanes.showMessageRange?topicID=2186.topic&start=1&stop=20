<br>
Tired of clerics wanting those gems in OS?<br>
Tired of hearing clerics complain about high Peridot costs?<br>
<br>
If you are, then I propose a solution to this age old problem.<br>
<br>
The next time you are in town, stop by the local gem merchant and purchase a stack or 2 of peridots. Then, when you are in a group and would like a symbol hand a peridot to the cleric and ask for a symbol when manna allows. This can also be used for runes.<br>
<br>
Now the gems are evenly distributed to all in the group, and noone can be mad about clerics getting the first couple.<br>
<br>
Lets take this to another zone and see what happens. Lets go to HS for instance. Hmm, no gems are dropping here. Tank_01 says,&quot;Need symbol&quot; The cleric says,&quot;Sure, give me a peridot and I'll hook you up!&quot; In a zone like this currently there is no way for a cleric to regain his costs, and usually leaves the zone down a little on pp. Add this up over a week or 2 and walla! The cleric is flat broke with a dwindling peridot supply. <br>
<br>
I guess the point I'm trying to make is that most people can join a pickup group and have fun with little or no expense, while the cleric can't say quite so much.<br>
<br>
Closing thoughts:<br>
<br>
Not every zone drops gems<br>
Not every cleric is rich<br>
If someone wants a symbol, why should the cleric pay for it?<br>
<br>
I'd like to here any views on this subject as I've thought it over and I don't see where splitting the costs hurts anyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utreage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Treage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/01 2:33:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:Clerics-Peridots and You (open discussion</span><hr size=1> Can this be moved to the general discussion please?<br>

Sure, I always buy a few stacks at a time, but between dispells, pickup raids, and carrying resist gear around all the time, I tend not to have enough inventory space to really last a long time without having to refresh my supply.<br>
<br>
I would suggest sending your cleric a tell first though, and not doing this in the middle of a fight. Nothing screws up the timing of a heal as badly as that trade window popping up =(<br>
<br>
Also I think you would need everyone in the group agreeing to this if you were in a zone that drops gems. As an example if I am in os and half the group is giving me peridots and the other half wants me to loot enough gems to cover the costs, how would I handle splitting up the remaining gems once the costs are covered? <br>

I originally started doing so because I had started raiding on Planes and noticed clerics/enchies would run out if we were there for a long period of time, so I thought a back up plan would be good.  <br>
<br>
Aside from raiding, I decided to carry them in general because of the grouping situation and clerics/enchies need them for buffs.  Granted, enchies not as much as the clerics, but they still need them for certain situations.  I wanted to have them to provide if they ran low or just didn't get the reimbursement from gem drops.  I always make it a practice to tell the group cleric/enchie that I have peridots for their use if they need them, and no I don't charge them .. they're for the betterment of the group afterall.<br>
<br>
The final reason I carry them is for the times I will inevitably need a rez and there are no clerics in my group or I do something stupid and am not in a group at all.  I figure it's a bit more of a thoughtful &quot;donation&quot; than platinum and it saves the cleric the trip to the merchant for a little while longer.  As a friend put it to me once, receiving peridots vs. platinum for a rez is the difference between the gift you want at Christmas and just cash. <p>Tormentcia

I can tell you in most groups unless you sit on yer ass and never get his you gotta put manaskin up after every few fights.  That costs a peridot.  Ever see wizzies asking for all the gems?<br>
I know what y'all gonna say.. manaskin is self-only.  Point is the whole lot is contributing towards group success so the whole group should evenly profit at the end of the day.<br>
To put it in perspective.. my 56 cleric friend recently sold all his excess gems from the bank to clear space and he made a FORTUNE!  These are the gems he has left over AFTER he sells/buys what he needs to when replacing whatever peridots he used.  Meanwhile, if no other items drop that are worth much, and not much else cash is looted... what do the rest of the classes get for their participation?<br>
<br>
I like the pay as you go idea.. it makes a lot more sense.  Dunno about the carrying them with you, as well as food, etc.  I never seem to have a problem carrying enough peridots, food, water, batwings, translocate chips, etc etc.. no matter where I go.

True that isnt always what happens but a good amount of time it does. I have had the oportunity of grouping with 3 clerics since I started hunting OS where after gem costs were covered the rest were given to the rest of the group. On other ocasions the cleric feel he needs to replace a 10 slot bag full of gems (yeahh right) out of his nightly group.<br>
<br>
I usually carry a stack or 2 of peridots and a stack of pearls so that my mage enchanter or cleric does run low I can make sure my group stays alive by getting the buffs they need.<br>
<br>
On a side note I also play a cleric mid lvl havent lvld him in a while and have people walk up out of the blue and deand that I buff and symbol them, If I do have mana and do buff them most of these types will walk away without so much as a thank you let alone pp for gem cost.<br>
<br>
Plain and simple pick up groups are sub average and walking away with exp for a night and a possible drop is worth more than stressing over a cleric or other master looter walking off with cash loot. Dont get me wrong Im not a rich person and can use the pp but you will never get a full answer to the question, while some play need before greed others play greed just as easily <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Gareorn Thistledown 57 Outridder Erollsi Marr

on  a  side note . only  people on  raids  that  NEED symbol  are people  that  are  GOING  to die without  it  . aka chanters ,  clerics  , main  assist ,  pull master. everyone else  should  be ok  if you  have a  decent  cleric in  group  or 2 not  in  group . (unless you  killing  bosstype mobs  obviously)<br>

Symbol is a no-brainer for the main puller, the chanter, and the main assist but why would a bard or druid need symbol?  (Okay, the bard gets it if no chanter in the group)  They are not gonna get a lot of aggro, and a halfway decent cleric should be able to keep them healed.<br>
<br>
I don't mind putting symbol where it is needed, but it just irks me when everyone expects it as their right.<br>

I give away items to newbies cause I hate sitting in EC selling *thats just me* but I do group in OS.  I do buff with symbols.  Because I give items away does that Mean I don't get some stone drops.  NO.  It does not.  I spend on average about 2 to 3 hundred pp a grouping.  Just on stones.  Unless you can beat that.  Then I don't see where the complaints are coming from?  I loot about 3 to 4 stones then start giving to the rest of the group.  The exception to this rule is when we are going to be somewhere , say the crypt, for long periods of time  then I will take 5 or 6 depending.  The rest of the stones go to The group.  <br>
<br>
Raids are different entirely.  I have a good guild and we make sure the cleric costs are covered.  If you have been invited and are a cleric then you can attest for yourself.   All guilds have some form of this in their loot policys I believe.  Its just common.<br>
<br>
With that said-- Have a great day -- happy hunting -- see ya in norrath<br>

<br>
WTF?  You saying a self-only buff doesn't count as spending money on the group?  Isn't someone casting self-only buff STILL a member of the group and contributing in some way to the group action?  What about the other group buffs that other classes use as well?  Not to mention a self-buffer using their own peridots is not getting buffed by the cleric asking for reimbursement.<br>
<br>
Paladins use symbol spells that require reagents too... never seen them asking for all the gems or any special compensation.<br>
Enchanters use reagents including peridots for their Rune spells.  When do they get special loot splits?<br>
All higher level &quot;kill shot&quot; spells including wizzie bane spells use reagents.  In fact banes use 2 peridots per cast.<br>
Wizzie, as I mention alrdy, use peridots for manaskin.  Without it we are dead, or the cleric can use precious mana healing us when they should be healing the tanks.<br>
In an AoE group in Seb I can guarantee the wizzies go thru a hundred of them on manaskin while the single cleric uses hardly any doing their job of keeping the enchanters alive.  Yet nobody asks for special loot splits in AoE.. the gems and everything else are split normally.<br>
<br>
FYI - My cleric friend made 6,500K on his gem cleanout.  That was after about 2 months of playing, and not all of it was spent in OS getting gems.  He loves the gem-split rule the way it is and you can see why.<br>
<br>
Bring on the pay-as-you-go rule.  Let people use a precious slot in their inventory and bring their own peridots for Symbols and Aego. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaladdor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caladdor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=9311062&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 463<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/28/01 7:26:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: clerics peridots and you </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Whats that retarded &quot;kaboom&quot; sound effect ? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Usually 7 or 8 hours. On average Draelyn carried a minimum of 40 peridots at all times. Symbol order was *always* main puller/assist, enchanter, secondary casters. I provided symbols for anyone else who felt like they needed one, but usually people avoided dying while I was in the group, so requests for them were low. I rarely even casted it on myself. <br>
<br>
     Regardless, if gem drops started out quite fast, I'd take about 10 decent quality gems, and the rest would get alpha randomed to the group. That way I'd cover the price of the 40 peridots I'd brought along for that hunt, the price to restock whatever I'd use on that particular hunt, and to cover any losses I'd had on a previous hunt where the drops were not so good. On average it worked very well. Almost no complaints really. <br>
But, different groups have different practices.<br>
