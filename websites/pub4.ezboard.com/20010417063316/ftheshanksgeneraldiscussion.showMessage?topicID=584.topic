(rp story inside)</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">The moon was shadowed by thick snow clouds making them glow faintly.  The stars twinkled in the brisk northern sky.  *Woahooooooooowhoo* There was the ever present north winds blowing the snow from dune to dune. *Arrrrroooooooooooohh* The occasional wolf can be heard in the distance. *Kerrker Kerrker* the sound of a large set of boots packing the snow underneath them as they trudged through the deep winters snow.<br>
<br>
Gorrgon paused to admire the sky this eve.  He gazed at the heavens and picked at his thick goatee.  His gazing and picking quickly turned into flashes of memories past, battles won and lost, comrades fallen, honor and glory gained and alluring vixens: he was hearing the call of his ancestors.  He smiled to himself, opened some honey mead and continued on.<br>
<br>
He was nearing the river that ran through everfrost, home of his kin.  He remembered a spot he so often sought as a youngster, a place where the fish bit just enough to feed you but not so much as you interrupt your rest and relaxation.  He walked out over the ice and unsheathed his great sword to chop a hole in the ice.  He constructed a makeshift pole from his battle staff, bandages and some jerky from his rations.  He stood over the hole and dropped his lure down.  <br>
<br>
He paused for a moment, something was not right.  He surveyed the ridge and ice flow for anything out of place.  He saw nothing so diverted his attention to his ice hole and noticed tiny cracks from the hole slowly moving near his feet.  After watching several of these cracks for sometime he knew what he must do, distribute his weight on the ice and get back to dry land.  Ever so slowly he squatted down so that he could lay on the ice, wondering to himself why the ice was not strong enough to support him.  Had he gained that much weight since he had fished here last, could it be all his new weapons and suit of armor?  He quickly shook the questions from his head and returned to the task at hand.<br>
<br>
He had just finished kneeling when he heard several loud cracks, this couldn’t be good.  Gorrgon took a barbarian sized gasp for air then layed his hands on the ice.  Just before his hands touched the ice it gave way and he fell into the frozen everfrost waters.  He ripped of his pack and got his bearings underwater.  The current was strong and he knew not to try and swim against it.  He knew of several ice holes further downstream but given the shadowed moon it would be hard to spot them.  He thought and reviewed his options.  He decided the best idea would be to go with the current and try to reach the water caves quite some ways downstream.  He outstretched his arms to catch more resistance and move quicker and conserved all the energy he could.  For two whole minutes he held his breath traveling downstream in what felt like eternity.  He knew he was close to the caves, but the current had bottomed out and he had to swim the rest of the way.  <br>
<br>
        Gorrgon surfaced and drew in breath like a whale coming up after a great dive.  He collapsed on the muddy floor of the cave entrance with his legs still in the water.  He lay there some time breathing heavily looking at the ceiling of the cave.  After some time to rest, all was quiet except for the ever-present drips and trickles of the water inside the cave.  He had never visited these caves much as a youngster for his own good, who knew what lurked in the poorly lit caverns.  His first thought was to get a fire going but he dropped his pack with flint, so he warmed up his lightstone that stayed around his neck, shook himself dry and journeyed into the cave.  After what seemed like hours of uneventful searching he saw a faint light in the distance.<br>
<br>
        Gorrgon saw the light coming from the side of the cave; he approached cautiously, hand on his sword.  He saw what appeared to be some sort of container covered in mud and moss.  He sheathed his sword and scraped away the mud with his hands, he saw a symbol on the top of the container.  It looked so familiar but he could not put a name on it.  He filled his palms with water trickling down the cave wall and cleaned off the symbol.  He thought hard, his eyes glancing downward, when his vision hit the pommel of his great sword.  It was the symbol of the combine empire.  As he pondered he drew his attention to the light coming from the box.  It appeared as some sort of soft pulsing light was sneaking through a keyhole in the box. <br>
        <br>
        Gorrgon brightened his lightstone and held it close to the keyhole.  This was like no keyhole he had ever seen.  It was a medium sized half sphere indentation with strange scribings on the inside.  Gorrgon sat down and opened another honey mead while he pondered.  He glanced down at the pommel of his great sword. “Hrmm,” he muttered to himself as he drank his mead and picked at his goatee.<br>
<br>
        Gorrgon unsheathed his sword and careful thrust the pommel into the keyhole.  He waited a moment for something to happen…nothing happened.  “Har har”, he laughed to himself”.  Gorrgon had a bit too much to drink and laughed hard enough to lose his balance.  Careful not to fall on the blade he twist the hilt of his sword and started to fall forward.  He was instantly blast backwards in a swift burst of magical energy as the box opened itself and light filled the cave.<br>
<br>
        Gorrgon kneeled in front of the box.  He rest his hand on the hilt of his sword as he peered into the box of light.  The box was lined in red velvet and had 4 small pulsing light spheres.  In the middle of the box was a cylinder containing a scroll. “Son of bastard mutant!”  Gorrgon hollered as he took his hand away from the sword.  Gorrgon nursed his burned fingertips as he inspected the searing hot sword.  “Blasted box burned a hole in me sword!”  Gorrgon removed the scroll and attempted reading it, not a barbarians strongpoint.  Gorrgon scratched his head and couldn’t recognize the language.  He wrapped up the scroll and put it in his tunic pocket.  He leaned forward to inspect the crystals closer.  They looked very similar to his pumice crystals, only much smaller and they emitted faint pulsing light.<br>
<br>
        Gorrgon slipped the crystals in his belt pouch, glancing down the tunnel to see if anyone was watching him (as if).  He grabbed his sword and headed home.<br>
<br>
        Later that eve Gorrgon spoke with his elder shaman about his days happenings.  He showed her the scroll and she faintly recognized it as the writings of the combine empire.  “I shall call the spirits to aid me translate”, he murmured under her breath.  She chanted for some time then begin to read the scroll to Gorrgon.<br>
<br>
        The scrolls were directions on how to use the counter magic system that a great human mage had discovered.  The Combine Empires biggest threat from the mutants was not their numbers nor their prowess in battle, but their magic.  The empire lost many great leaders and officers to the deadly magics of the mutants so they devolved a system to protect their most important officers.  When the crystals were inserted into specially prepared weapons they could cancel most magic, if charged.  When not in use the stones recharge themselves for later use.  It seems Gorrgons blade was one of the officer’s weapons.<br>
<br>
        Following the verbal instructions careful, Gorrgon slipped one of the crystal spheres into the hole burned into his sword.  Gorrgon nearly burned his other hand as the crystal adhered itself to the lining of the sword.  It burned brightly for a moment then went dark.<br>
<br>
        “Wells, I guess we’d be wise ta test if it worked” Gorrgon suggested to the shaman.  “Them mutants like tryin’ to stop me from moving with that earth magic root, trys rootin’ me”<br>
        <br>
        The shaman was many years older and wiser then the mutant and easily broke through Gorrgons magic defense.  The roots came up through the ground and wrapped around his feet and legs.<br>
<br>
        “I dunna think it works, ye sure ya read them instructions right,” Gorrgon asked.<br>
<br>
ZzzzzarK!  The crystal flashed brightly and the roots burned away.  Gorrgon nearly dropped the sword in the blinding flash.<br>
<br>
        “Har!  Huzzah Rallos!  I know some dirty mutant druids that got it comin!”<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry for any grammar errors.  I just wanted to finish it!<br>
