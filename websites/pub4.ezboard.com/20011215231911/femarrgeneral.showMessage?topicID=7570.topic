<br>
Before I get to Siilverain's proposal, let me make three other comments:<br>
<br>
1. Thanks to VP for toning down the flames on this issue and helping everyone move toward an actual resolution with some thoughtful posts.<br>
<br>
2. On the FFA issue, I am well aware of the capabilities of the big guilds.  I've been on that side of the fence, and I fully understand the difficulties that would be faced by a pickup group.  Knowing all of that, I stand by what I said before.  However, this is all academic, because it appears that we're going to resolve the issues relating to the pickup raid slot.<br>
<br>
3. Chuk, I don't think the big guilds would be finished in four months.  You have to take membership turnover into account.  There is always going to be some new wizard in one of the big guilds who needs the staff from VS.<br>
<br>
Now for Siilverain's proposal.  Here is what Siilverain said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Suggestion_01 says,<br>
<br>
Leader who is interested in running VS raid expresses interest no later than 10 days prior to expected pickup rotation spawn. This can be done either via email with interested raid leaders or via Emarr Boards D&amp;P. Given no issue with other leaders, the initial leader would plan and execute raid. If there is an issue with another raid leader, the leaders in question would be expected to work out an agreement. If no agreement is reached, that particular VS spawn becomes FFA to whatever leader can mobilize forces first. <br>
<br>
I believe this would be the most effecient personally. 10 days prior to VS spawn would give all interested leaders a chance to respond &amp; discuss the upcoming spot. My preference is to discuss via emails as not everyone has 24/7 access to the boards. This I speak from personal experience.... As I've expressed before, I'm open to further suggestions. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think that posting on D&amp;P should be mandatory.  We have no way of identifying all of the people who might be interested in the VS spawn.  A posting on D&amp;P gives reasonable notice to everyone.  Sure, there are some people who never look at D&amp;P, or who don't speak English, but this is the best that we can do.  I have no problem with sending you an e-mail in addition to posting on D&amp;P.<br>
<br>
The more troublesome issue is how to resolve a situation where conflicting raid leaders cannot reach an agreement.  I'm not very enthusiastic about the idea of a &quot;rotation within a rotation,&quot; as suggested by Drywit.  On the other hand, I'm not very enthusiastic about your proposal because it could turn the pickup slot into a race.  Given that the whole purpose of the rotation system is to eliminate the need to race to VS, that would seem like a poor solution.<br>
<br>
Just the same, I'm willing to give your solution a shot.  It may be that we can work out conflicts and share the pickup slot.  I'm comforted by the more recent comments by VP members, especially Theo.  As for Gorndax, there is considerable animosity between us, but he's never been a jerk about raid scheduling.  In any event, if your solution winds up turning the pickup slot into a FFA, we can revisit the issue later.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, we are now agreeing to communicate.  That's a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
As for the server downtime on Monday, please post something on D&amp;P if VS does not spawn for you.  I still haven't received the e-mail that you posted, so we shouldn't rely on e-mail as a form of emergency communication.  If VS does not spawn for you, we'll try to assemble a raid group and take him down after the servers come back up. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

<br>
We'll just have to see how it goes.  Though from my personal experience, all of the pick-up leaders I know off hand shouldn't have a problem reaching an agreement on who is to run the next rotation.  I shudder to think of the pick-up slot becoming a &quot;race&quot;, that would not be condusive to good relations.<br>

I have been helping wizards with their epics for a very long time now. ive killed countless phingels and countless broken golems. The wizard epic is extremley tedious. I dont see VS as anything but another phinny step except hes not a 18 hour(or 24 hour) spawn like phin.<br>
I see flame after flame on the em board about who was supposed to kill VS who killed VS who stole VS from whom and that tells me somewhere something is wrong. <br>
<br>
I think the idea of making VS free for all is a good one. People are worried  guilds will take advantage of this by hogging the spawn. Well look at the rotation. So far the majority of guilds have respected the rotation why wouldnt they have the same courtesy as to not hog the spawn if it was free for all?  <br>
<br>
Yes a new wizard can join a guild who needs his epic, so that guild simply kills VS who will be up more than usual. He will stay up becuase of lack of rotation and lack of pressure on that guild to have to kill him or lose their spot in the rotation forever like what happened to Magister 5 months ago when we gave up on VS the first time.<br>
<br>
As i said this will benefit the small guilds eventually becuase they will have time to learn how to kill VS and develop strategy. <br>
<br>
I wish they had a VS remains that dropped  the staff so this whole mess  would never happen <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742"target="_blank">

Ever heard the phrase 'A locked door keeps honest people honest'?<br>
<br>
I remember as well as anyone else the people that Divine Grace pissed off by jumping VS and trak spawns (was it trak?  I think so ...).  At least one guild in the past hasn't respected that rotation, there were quite a few others who I'd heard discussions with in experience grinds where people were saying things to the effect of 'Our guild leader is getting tired of this, we are thinking about just jumping VS as soon as he spawns', and things like that.<br>
<br>
Before you may not have heard people talking about it, but there've been people thinking it.  This just gives them a chance to say 'you had no claim', so you haven't any room to bitch about it when it happens.<br>
<br>
Then again, I'm a bard.  VS rotation means exactly dick to me.<br>

If a wizzie really wants their epic they could &quot;hold the camp&quot; just like a cleric holding Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Once VS spawns, you have 2-3 hours to get your folks together to take him out.  If you can't take him out, then that VS becomes FFA.<br>
<br>
As Chuk stated (I don't remember which post, but I'm pretty sure he said something to this affect), the quicker VS is killed, the quicker the next one spawns.  This would probably result in 2-3 more VS's per month.<br>
<br>
It just requires a change of thinking.  VS would no longer be considered a &quot;loot&quot; mob.  VS would be considered a &quot;wizzy epic&quot; mob, just like Ragefire.<br>
<br>
I doubt that people would actually go for this idea, but I thought I would just throw it out there for discussion.<br>

<br>
What if we find out what pick up leaders are interested in being a part of this and have a designated number of seats in each raid for each raid.  However, only one wizard from each group could attend and all would have the chance at the random.   <br>
<br>
Anyway, it's just a fleeting thought I had today and may be more trouble than it's worth, but I figured since we're brain storming, I'd see if I could try to be part of the solution. <p>Tormentcia

<br>
Off the top of my head, I can't think of any wizards associated with CBA/VP or Gorndax/RE who we would exclude from consideration.  I would hope that CBA/VP and Gorndax/RE would say the same thing about the wizards who raid with us.  If everyone focuses on winning the fight, the loot should sort itself out. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

Turn all the VS stuff over to someone to manage as far as points go, and whoever wants to lead a raid of any type under this system is obligated to look for wizards on this list who are currently online, and ask them to come.<br>
<br>
Now this could potentially create a problem with it turning into a popularity contest ... which could suck.  But I would think that'd be better than the current system where the only people who have a chance is those in guilds capable of doing VS.<br>
<br>
Of course this doesn't negate the ability for a guild to go do VS.  If someone ganks him, good for them.  But under an organized system, among the wizards who actually attend a raid, whoever has the most 'points' can take the staff.  If two or more wizards present have equal points, they random it.<br>
<br>
Basically, anyone who wants to run a 'sponsored' raid would be able to say 'These wizards were on my raid, of those that didn't get a staff, these wizards attended: xxx, yyy, zzz' ...<br>

Never had a problem with DG, always have found them to be reasonable, courteous people. This is a blue server and basically any guild can take what they want when they want as long as they get there first and have the ability to do so. This doesnt happen because people respect the rotation and respect each other for the most part. Again a FFA system will work based on the past history of respect on this server.     <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742"target="_blank">
