Were it not for her Teir’Dal heritage, Aael would be blind right about now. She always loved to watch the night come alive in this forest she called home. Sounds of wild beast came to life as they woke for their nightly hunt.<br>
<br>
Two guards stood watch at the entrance to Neriak. Their boredom became apparent at they turned their attention on a poor spiderling that happen to be wandering by. Aael did not care much for spiders but to see Neriak’s finest wasting their time to slay such a trivial creature without impunity only added to her sorrow. Out of the gloom, a purple skinned orc came running past the guards and entered Neriak with all haste.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   A Crushbone Orc? So far from home…</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Aael thought to herself. Strange, but other thoughts kept her mind occupied this night. So long ago it had happened. So long had she been alone. It was this very night, so long ago, when her parents were killed. Without remorse, with full spite and malice did the servants of Innoruuk come to Neriak and slew her parents. She never did know why. Some rumors said it was because her parents betrayed Innoruuk. Though how or why, she did not know. Other rumors said it was because her parents had helped those with light skin. This she could not (or did not) want to believe. In all her life, she had never ventured beyond the veil of mists that shrouded Nektulos Forest. And, if not for those light skinned creatures that inhabited the Foreign Quarter, she would be inclined to believe that they did not exist.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the true reason why her parents died, in her heart, she believe it was Innoruuk that killed her parents. For this reason, and this one alone, she had forsaken the God of Hate. All these years, Aael had to fend for her self. As a Dark Elf, Aael knew that charity was not a common trait among her people. She remembered many night, having to run through streets and alleys to avoid being raped or beaten or killed. Long ago, a kind enchantress (well, about as kind as Teir’Dal come anyway) taught Aael how to perform a minor illusion. This little trick had saved her many times over. Unfortunately, that enchantress died shortly after do to unknown circumstances. Aael never had a chance to thank her for her kindness but has thanked her in her heart many times over.<br>
<br>
The cruel streak that was inherent in her people never ran as deep through Aael’s heart, though in some situations, she found herself to be more Teir’Dal then she wanted to be. Once, a particularly nasty thug had set his eyes on her. He had chased her and tracked her through all the parts of the city. He and his gang would not give up pursuit. A few times, Aael managed to lose them for a few hours or a day or two, but eventually, they would find her trail again. Sometimes, Neriak was not a big as Aael would have liked it to be. She began to grow weary of the chase and knew that if she did not do something soon, she would slip up and he would find her. She devised a plan. She would single him out from the rest of his gang and make sure that he or his henchmen would never bother her again. She was able to split them up in Neriak 3rd Gate and led the foul mongrel down a dead end ally. She cast the Minor illusion on herself and appeared as a torch on the wall. As the thug passed her, she dropped the illusion and came down on the back of his neck with the full force of her dagger. The man fell to the ground with a thud and a slight exhalation of air, his last to be exact. Aael knew that the dead body of their leader alone was not enough to deter the vengeance that was sure to follow. And though she dread the task ahead, she knew what had to be done.<br>
<br>
Dripping with Teir’Dal blood from head to foot, Aael knew her task was complete. In the recesses of her mind, she screamed at the horror. On the outside, her eyes narrowed and her faced creased with a smile that would have made Innoruuk himself cringe. Now it was time to wash the blood from her body and clothes. The moat around the Clerics guild would do nicely. That is where they drained the blood from the sacrifices. A little more blood would not be noticed.<br>
<br>
The next morning, a crowd had gathered around a gruesome sight in front of the Library. On a pike, rested the skinned remains of some unknown Teir’Dal. Unknown that is until you looked at the shell of that corpse nailed up to the wall next to the pike. On the wall, above the skinned Dark Elf were two words written in the blood of that wretched corpse: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   No More</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Though Aael still saw some of the members of that gang from time to time, she was never again bothered by any of them. One even held a door for her once at the Blind Fish.<br>
<br>
The night grew cold as the seasons changed. Though it never snowed here, some nights in the Forest became quite chilled. Aael wrapped her shawl a little tighter around her shoulders but still the night air crept in. She decided to go back into the city to see if she could scrounge up some food. Perhaps a muffin or two and a bottle of milk. She heard some loud voices coming out of the Blind fish as she neared the bank. There was a small shop next to the bank where she always went to get some food, The Refined Palate, though they did not sell many different foods in there. She new Niz, one of the shop keepers there, and he was often very kind to her (again, about as kind as a Teir’Dal could be). She decided to put off her meal for a bit to see what the argument was about. She opened the door to the Blind Fish and stepped inside. At once, the smell of stale mead and exotic wines brought back that familiar feel that she always felt when coming here. Down below the confrontation continued on. She stepped up to the bar on the top floor and ordered a Honey mead. It was not her favorite drink, but rarely could she afford the bottle of Red Wine she so enjoyed. The bartender, recognizing a familiar face, warned her against going downstairs.<br>
<br>
“Aye, they been at it for a good fifteen minutes now. Camia is at it again with the leader of the Necromancer’s Guild, Xon Quexill. Seems they are in disagreement on who’s magic be stronger”<br>
<br>
“Carmia? The leader of the Enchanters?” Aael replied.<br>
<br>
“Aye, the one and the same.”<br>
<br>
“I must get a closer look. Thanks for the mead.”<br>
<br>
Aael took the bottle of mead and started down the stairs. At a table by the window, sat the two opposing guild leaders. Aael took a table a short distance away. Just as she sat down, Xon stood up as he slammed his mug of ale on the table, hard.<br>
<br>
“You Enchanters have little regard for the future of all Teir’Dal. You do not keep Innoruuk in your heart and many of you have forsaken him all together. As our true strength only comes through Innoruuk’s will, we have been and always will be the most powerful of all Teir’Dal. You and your ways disgust me and one day, Innoruuk will have your soul as he always will in the end. And for you, I promise, there will be no mercy.”<br>
<br>
As he turned to leave, Carmia spoke. “Believe what you wish Xon. Believe what you wish. But true power comes from diversity and free thought. Not stagnation and narrow minds. In the end we will all meet our maker and when the time comes, I will have no regrets.”<br>
<br>
Carmia shouted the last part just as Xon exited the Blind fish and slammed the door behind him. She sat back and laughed as she breathed a sigh of relief. More that the debate was over then actually having accomplished anything. She stood and took the last draw on her Ale. She noticed Aael sitting by herself and also noticed that she took some interest in the heated argument that resounded through out the Blind Fish. She walked over to where Aael was seated and stood there for a moment. Aael, nervous at being so near to the Guild Mistress of the Enchanter’s Guild, just sat there quietly, not daring to look Carmia in the face.<br>
<br>
“And where exactly do you stand on the subject of magic young one?” Carmia asked Aael.<br>
<br>
In a ever so slightly quivering voice Aael said, “Mistress, surely I am not in any position to answer that question. My knowledge of such matters is very little of any at all. Surely one of your…”<br>
<br>
“Answer me now child. Even with limited knowledge of the subject, you should still be allowed your own opinion. Everyone has the right to that at least.” Carmia said in a slightly more forceful manner.<br>
<br>
The tone of Carmia’s voice told Aael that she had better answer. She had no idea what the consequences were nor did she care to find out.<br>
<br>
“Mistress, I…I think…well, I think you are right. I do not wish to anger the Necromancers because they truly are powerful. Though other forms of magic are powerful in their own right. Like the Wizards for example. They can teleport to other places around all Norrath, even to a few planes. That is a power that not even the Necromancers have. The Enchanters as well. They have the power to mesmerize their foes and charm them into fighting for them, even dying for them. With their power of illusions, they can traverse many cities and areas around Norrath unhindered. Truly that is a power that necromancers will never realize.”<br>
<br>
“Well spoken child. It is refreshing to hear from such an insightful mind. Walk with me if you will young one?”<br>
<br>
For a moment, Aael sat stunned. She did not know how to answer or should she answer at all. For a moment, she forgot all of her own troubles. Slowly though, she stood and fell in beside Carmia. Carmia walked up the stairs and exited the Blind Fish.<br>
<br>
“What is your name?” Carmia asked with a wry smile, “or would you like for me to keep calling you child?”<br>
<br>
“Yes Mistress..er I mean No Mistress…er I mean Aaeleaa Mistress. My name is Aaeleaa, but my friends call me Aael. You, may call me Aael.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you Aael. I am honored that you consider me among your friends. And you may call me Carmia. Mistress just makes me sound so old.”<br>
<br>
“No, Mistre…Carmia. The honor is mine. Long have I lived here and never in that time had I imagined that I would be walking beside one so powerful.”<br>
<br>
“Bah! I am no different then you in many respects. I have just lived longer and been a bit more lucky then most is all. I am a Dark Elf as you are a Dark Elf. How can you survive down here, in such a inhospitable place?”<br>
<br>
“I survive. That is what I do. I have no job or allegiance to anyone. I kill beasts to sell their remains to merchants for food and water. I am good friends with Niz L’Crit and he sometimes lets me sleep in the back of the shop near the oven on cold nights. Sometimes he pays me to bring him bags full of spider legs or snake eggs for cooking. It has kept me alive this long.”<br>
<br>
“What would you do Aael if you had the chance to? Anything at all.”<br>
<br>
Aael did not have to think long. Many warm nights she had laid awake in the comfort of Nektulos Forest thinking of far off lands and grand adventures. She would then dream of stories her parents told her of felling Giants and many other strange and wondrous creatures.<br>
<br>
“I would like to be an adventurer. To travel to distant lands and see all the different places and peoples. I have always wanted to see the land of the ancients. The land where we were supposed to have come from. I would like to travel to the fabled city of Kelethin and marvel at the city in the trees.”<br>
<br>
When Aael finished, she suddenly noticed that they were standing in the entry hall to the Tower of the Spurned. The guild hall for Enchanters, Mages, and Wizards. Never before had she dared entered the halls of such great power. Aael’s first instinct was to turn around and run out of there as quickly as she could before anyone figured out she was not supposed to be there. Though she felt that was the best course of action, she knew that to run out on the Mistress would be even worse then being there unbidden.<br>
<br>
Quietly she said, “Mistress Carmia, I should not be here. I beg your forgiveness and will leave immediately.” With a quick bow, Aael turned to leave.<br>
<br>
“And why should an Enchanter apprentice not be in the Enchanter’s Guild I ask you?” Carmia said loudly from behind Aael.<br>
<br>
Aael stopped in her tracks. She slowly looked from side to side and saw no others standing in the hall. She turned around cautiously and looked around the rest of the room. No, no others were present in this room. She looked at Carmia with all the hope of the world in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“Me Mistress?” Aael asked forgetting the earlier request to not call Carmia, Mistress. “I am no Enchanter Apprentice M’Lady. I do not…”<br>
<br>
“Nonsense. You already have the first two qualities of being an enchanter. An open mind and a sense of adventure. I am merely giving you the same opportunity that someone gave to me so long ago. The choice is your to make, but the offer stands. I will make it this one time and one time only. If you decline, you will not be given another.”<br>
<br>
“Oh yes Mistress. Yes, I will accept your offer. Thank you so much. You do not know how much this means to me. Thank you.”<br>
<br>
“I think I have a slight idea how you feel. Now run downstairs and let them know I sent you. They will get an apprentice’s robe for you. After all, we can’t have our enchanters running around in torn and ragged clothes now can we. We must keep up appearances. That is what we are all about after all.” With a slight smile and a wink, Carmia retired to her quarters.<br>
<br>
From this day forward, Aael was an enchanter. Soon she would get to travel the world. Soon she would see things she had only dreamed about. With a new aura of pride, she left the Tower of the Spurned. With a quick stop in to show Niz her new robe, she left Neriak. With her newly scribed spells in her spell book and a small stack of tiny daggers, Aael stepped beyond the veil of mist that was her only home for so long and oh was the world a big place.<br>
