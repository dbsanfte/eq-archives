 I'm getting so pissed that everytime i see a sweet ass item that there eather Nefred &lt; for those who dont know Nerfed means verants bored so they fuck something up &gt; or they take them outta the game. <br>
 Examples: I just recentley found out about these petrified bark greaves so I look up info and shit and find out that there a GM quest and that theres like 2 pairs on the server. Why cant shit like this be as common as blackened alloy? <br>
 Example2: Guise of Deciever, Verant really fucked up that time, they made a sweet ass thing and then they fucked it up.<br>
 Example3: Rubicite Armor (bp) that bp is the same stats as Iksar regen bp and i see the regen bps sell faster than a whore at a horny virgins party. <br>
<br>
What im trying to say why take all the trouble to design sweet ass shit then take it outta the game faster than a cherry being popped at new years? <p>"Your Mom is a Shitgoose"

WTF?</span><hr size=1> Stop your fucking whining. You haven't had ANY major nerfs happen to you. You want to see a nerf? Put yourself in the shoes of the rogue who got his Mrylokar's Dagger of Blood totally trashed. God, oh no, not a Rubicite BP! Did you ever think there was maybe, just maybe, a reason behind it? Perhaps it was too easy to get? Perhaps it was too common? So they removed it. Big fucking deal. Does it effect you in any way? No. Was it some <b>amazing</b> chestplate? No. <br>
<br>
I've seen tons of nice stuff, does that mean I'm going to bitch about it that I can't get it? You're level 23. Grow up. You have better equipment then most people I see in SolB. You expect people to pity you because all you have is *sniff sniff* your RVF armor, Iksar BP, and Defiance? Oh, how awful.<br>
<br>
Were you even playing the game when Guise of the Deciever still existed? Probably not. What the hell does bitching about it get you? Anything? No.<br>
<br>
Oh, and GM event items? You're whining because GM event items aren't common? Oh yea, nice logic. Just because its nice, it should be common. This is almost as bad as the moron I saw on Allakhazam who said "reviviscense should only be a lvl 20 clr spell cuz they can cast it at that lvl since it doesnt use much mana". Maybe just because its nice, it should drop off an_orc_pawn_02? No. EverQuest always has (and possibly always will) reward the player who spends the most time playing. Not the person whos been in the game for 4 months and is now complaining about things that happened a year before they got it.<br>
<br>
<b>Fucking get over it.</b><br>
<br>
Or, maybe I'm wrong, and we should all go petition that everyone on the server should be given a Celestial Scabbard (35ac +100 all saves shoulder slot, GM given). I mean, thats nice, so everyone should get one... right?<br>
<br>
Ever stop and think that the reason its rare is what makes it nice? If every single person on the planet had a 9 bedroom house and 4 Lexus' in the driveway, that would no longer be a big thing. That would be the normal. Then, someone else would get something better. Everyone would bitch that they wanted it. The reason a big, rare, hard to get thing is good, is because it IS rare and hard to get. Thats why it can be made good. Not everyone gets one. <br>
<br>
Think about posting next time before you start crying over things that have no relevance to you. <p><BR>

<br>
Go Away.  <br>
<br>
I like checking this boards for sales, current events, witty back and forth, etc. and what do I see when I click on rants and flames?  I'll give you a hint.  It starts with S and ends with emi-literate fool jacking his jaw about things that do not, in the grand scheme of things, matter.  Now I realize nothing about this game truly matters, but the junk you post is the antithesis of important.<br>
<br>
While I am at it, your auctions of &quot;WTB Jo Momma's UNDERPANTS&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;WTS MY FATHER'S DILDO&quot; are not entertaining.  Furthermore, the way you 'highlight' your auctions is not helpful to me in deciding if I want to buy the items you are selling, hell they aren't even eye candy.<br>
<br>
Ever since you had your '6 degrees of Ghalewind' escapade in the scammer forum, it makes me flatly sick to see your name attached to a post.  You've proven yourself to not only be very lame, but you have to propitiate this by hitting the 'Add Post' button every time something in EC tickles your jib.  So what if you want to sell a ruby bp?  Who cares if you muster up 100k?  That just means you are a helmet wearing retard with 100k.  Seeing your name attached to the drivel that you spin out is enough reason for me personally to stear clear of you at every turn.  Not because I think you are inherently a bad person, but because I don't like to decipher retardese.<br>
<br>
In short, please don't post.  It makes Baby Jesus cry. <p>Lemming Twin of Slayne™

Like i told you in game, you are only lvl 23, there are alot of people over 40 with gear that isnt as good as yours. Use that advantage to go lvl up, and earn gear the right way. I was in all bronze at 23, and thats not even as bad as the people who came before me, what do you have ? all royal velum minus bp ?

WTF?</span><hr size=1> Incidentally, I believe that Rubi armour is actually pretty crappy. The non-BP pieces have the same AC as crafted armour and no stats - ugh. The BP, meanwhile, has the same AC as a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate, but has inferior regen (3 pt on Rubi, 5pt on Iksar?).<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, if you really want a Rubi BP, you can buy one for no more than 20-25k .. that's really not very much in the high end game. I had one for a while and then sold it when I realised that A) Lots of things are much better, and B) with the introduction of dyed plate, it's not even much of a fashion statement or status symbol any more.<br>
<br>
The guise of the deceiver has no value whatsoever except as a status symbol. Want shrink? Buy potions. Want Ultravision? Get buffed or buy an item, there are plenty.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the whole point of a status symbol is, by definition, to denote status. In the case of the Guise, it's to show that you were playing and were able to get to ass/sup back in the old days. I suspect that neither of the above apply to you, and therefore (since you lack the status), wanting the status symbol makes no sense.<br>
<br>
I doubt you ever played EQ pre-Kunark, but if you had you'd know that in terms of gear, things are SO much easier for the new player these days that it's not even funny.<br>
<br>
Oh, and to throw in my vote with the majority ... quit your damn whining.<br>

<br>
Petrified Bark legs, GM Quest reward, yes they are good. But maybe cause they are a unique item. I bet there is better now too. Making them as common is plain moronic, would undermine the economy even more (not saying it is good now, but still).<br>
<br>
Rubicite BP, obviously you were not around in CT when rubicite dropped, i fully agree with the removal of this armor set.<br>
<br>
Guise of the Deciever, read BRD/ROG only... why should everyone be able to use that?. why should everyone walk around looking as a Dark Elf? you wanna be a dark elf? make on then. or make a bard/rogue and get the mask. very simple.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some nerfs are wrong, the Dagger from ToV was wrong to nerf, but if you think about it, most were legit nerfs and for the good of the game. Like the low delay weapons level 30 mobs dropped.<br>
<br>
<br>
spoiled brats. Were you around when level 50's were wearing bronze armor?. Were you around when the Ykesha sword was the best weapon attainable? and only 5-6 were on the server.<br>
Did you have a lockjaw tunic and banded armor at level 41?<br>

WTF?</span><hr size=1> Man, I remember back in the day!!! I was wearing Bronze Armor (full suit) and was carrying around a Bone Bladed Claymore. I thought I was the &quot;SHIT!&quot; And you won't believe how hard I worked my ass off to get the money for that shit. Saving every bit of silver and copper from Skellies or madmen!!!! WHEW DOGGY!!!!<br>
<br>
And now at lvl 52 still working my ass off to get what I need/want! I don't have that great of gear either. Tree Weave, Crusty Armor, 2 peices of Umbral, and a lil more. Busted my ass for all that too. Just got myself a new Weapon aswell, spent 3k on it. How'd I get the money? Days of hunting HG's! YA BABY! And you know what, I wouldn't change any bit of it. I like the way my char is and I always will.<br>
<br>
So, to the lil bitch whinning about shit that doesn't effect you, SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU LIL SHIT! I have not one ounce of respect for you, nor does it seem from anyone else on these threads. People like you are the ones who make games like this a fucking drag. All you want is &quot;this and that.&quot; Well, you know what...... Wait, No, just fuck it, probably to ignorant to comprehend what I am trying to get across. Let me just finish off by saying, meet me in the Arena sometime, I need to let off some steam...<br>

I think I was still in my Gossamar Robe (the one so bad it doesn't drop anymore).  Later we had a full-scale raid on Najena, yes Najena, to get some FBRs.  Kinda sad how now it's hard to even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> give</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a Flowing Black Robe away.<br>
<br>
And to play devil's advocate, Nerfing is not what VI does to screw with players.  It's pretty hard to believe 5 guys sitting around a desk are saying to themselves &quot;how can we piss off our paying customers?&quot;  Items are changed because they are broken. <p><img src="http://www.faydwer.com/everquest/images/signatures/Xargylex.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubarrymoreyorke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Barrymore Yorke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 344<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/14/01 11:13:39 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.animfactory.com/banner/tkgk5012en.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: O.K.
