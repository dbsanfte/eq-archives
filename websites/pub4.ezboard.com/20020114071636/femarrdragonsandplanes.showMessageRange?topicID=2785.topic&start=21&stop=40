It's called distribution.  Asking for a shot at something you have no direct use for is greedier than asking for a shot at something that will VASTLY improve your performance in battle in my opinion.  Therefore NBG (that newbie group rule that appeared in KC) isn't really a greedy tank rule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unewshardon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NewShardon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/16/01 12:16:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> But a wizzy who wins CoF and sells for PP or trades for items is better than the tank who claimed NBG to win the item and then just does the same thing and sells it.<br>

Scroll back through &quot;item bazaar&quot; and see how many CoF's, RBB's, etc are for sale.  Sure, some of those came from Magister, MF raids, etc where they don't need them, but the vast majority come from the tanks on Vox and Naggy raids.<br>

<br>
But my stance about levels is this. I created my character back in 99. Alot of people nowadays that aren't already uber but are 60 are people that bitch about having 60 days on their character and that started postRoK. <br>
<br>
Now I said alot, so the 3 or 4 of you that will say you fall into this category will fall into this category.<br>
<br>
But I have over 114 playing days to my level 55 wizard. I have put a shit load of alot of time into my character, and I have died alot, got into sucky exp groups, and post 50 gotten hardly any groups. And if I have it's just as an extra hand cause they don't need anymore ench's tank's or healers.<br>
<br>
I felt*felt, cause I am not going to continue this game in a month.* That I needed my epic because of the effort and time I put into this game. But in my old guild it was set up that levels were what determined who got their epic first. Low and behold someone I twinked up when they were little was in front of me. He didn't play longer, he just got lucky. While I would be lfg in OS or attempting to kite raptors and dying because I was on a dail up slow ass modem.<br>
<br>
I believe I had just as much a right to a epic that he did, but did I argue? Nope. <br>

I just left. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaauan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/16/01 2:51:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> i agree with Cao, although i feel i'm in a better situtation to sya that people who stay 52 are only hurting themselves and thier guild. while Cao has the option for a ND, i don't. i killed naggy and vox a few times, never even seen my books drop. i was already hitting the 52 cap and it came time to either level, or stay 52. being lvl 52 sucks bad, so i leveled. i've never regretted it once. i look at how god awful the pally epic is, the ratio is horrible, any pally 59+ can use the 2 handed bash skill if they choose. it only has 15 ac, decent resists, but thats easy to offset. and the proc is a joke. but it's a status symbol, if thats what people go for fine, but complaining about being 52, thats totally your choice.<br>
<br>
bards got it bad, but with every patch they break bards, with ever expansion they screw bards up more, do you expect anything else? the easy option, would be to make a triggered naggy and vox, make them drop a scale, a book each respectively. hell druids and rangers get it, why the crap can't we?<br>

<br>
Like it or not, the old world dragons have become somewhat of a rite of passage.  People want to go do those raids.  There are people who hit 45 and think to themselves &quot;I can make a Naggy/Vox roster now!&quot;, and it's their reward for 45 levels of play to be able to do a multigroup raid.  A lot of these folks are not the twinks of higher level players, they grew up in a small guild or no guild at all, watching, playing, and levelling.<br>
<br>
By the time they hit 50+, they are by then more seasoned at these raids.  Seems fair to me that their chance for loot comes around with it.<br>
<br>
Nobody that I know of wants to stay farming Nagafen and Vox for epic items.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my point.  There is a cycle that goes through them.  Nagafen and Vox are like the gateways of the pick-up community, where everyone can participate in a raid of this scope.<br>
<br>
They join, they do their time.  Their raid leaders level up.  And they become leaders or experienced hands themselves.<br>
<br>
It's been a healthy cycle, all things considered.<br>
<br>
That said, the 50+ limit for epic loot makes sense.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Crombattleaxe was 45.  He went on a dragon raid.  He learned from some folks.  He led some raids.  When it was his time, he won his book and he moved on.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Brecht was 45.  He went on a dragon raid.  He learned from some folks.  He led some raids.  When it was his time, he won his scale and he moved on.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Kerna was 45.  He went on a dragon raid.  He learned from some folks.  He led some raids.  When it was his time, he won his book and moved on.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, Jexielia was 45.  She went on a dragon raid.  She learned from some folks.  She led some raids.  When it was her time, she moved on.<br>
<br>
Get the picture?  Like it or not (and if you are debating this, I daresay not), folks go through this cycle.  It's not a bad thing.  People benefit from this.  The old world dragons have a level cap, the higher guilds are way past it.  It is the doorway for the younger up-and-coming people.<br>
<br>
And that said, the level restrictions on loot help preserve the cycle.  And in my own opinion, it is worth preserving.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you think it's unfair, too slow, you've got better things to do with your time, you're impatient, you'd rather go farm cash and buy the chainquesting rights of the item, you don't want to submit yourself to &quot;the cycle&quot; (which has in practice been adopted by the server at large), then put together your own raid and your own rules.<br>
<br>
Don't you see?  The lower level people submit themselves to the cycle willingly.  That's why they go.  They attend, they learn, they lead (or coach), and they move on.  And in the lower levels, they know up front that they will not get a shot at the epic loot.  But they still go.<br>
<br>
Those of you who complain about the level restriction on loot are the ones who don't want to submit to the server-adopted process.  You are the ones who don't want to &quot;do your time&quot;.<br>
<br>
It's an FFA game, do as you will.  Anyone with enough friends and firepower can muster a raid and call the dragon and move on it.<br>
<br>
Most level 45 people (who are not RL friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, or twinks of uberguilds) can't.  That's why &quot;the cycle&quot; works.  And it is also why it is effective.<br>
<br>
And so, grandstanding on behalf of the &quot;poor downtrodden loot-cheated level 45-49 people&quot; seems rather silly and ineffective to me.  These are pick-up raids!  Your idea of what is fair doesn't really matter!  A pick-up dragon raid leader receives their authority from the people they lead.  If their loot rules were not in accordance with what the majority thought was proper, they wouldn't get the people together to do the raid!  Naggy/Vox raids fail because of this all the time.  Non-attendance == failed raid.<br>
<br>
Listen to me carefully.  In pick-up raids, majority &gt; you.<br>
<br>
The majority thinks it's fair, ergo the leader posts the rules, the leader gets the muster together (because enough people agree), they succeed on the raid, and the cycle moves on.<br>
<br>
If you want different rules, lead the raid (or get someone to do it).  If everyone thinks it's fair, they'll go, you will succeed, hooray for you!<br>
<br>
From what I see, the rest is just complaining.<br>
<br>
There you go, that's my 2cp.<br>

2. It boosts singing songs (ones that require no instrument) by 80%. This is how bards can help provide those really insane damage shields. It is also how they can provide straight attack rating boosts. Without it, these aspects are mediocre at best.<br>
3. It procs a groupwide attack boost as well as haste that lasts for a good chunk of time.<br>
<br>
If you doubt my opinion, go ask Thott(guildleader of Afterlife). Go ask one of the bards from FoH. Go ask bards in any of the big guilds that do endgame mobs. They will all tell you that it could be a weapon on par with a rusty dagger and they would still wield it due to the effects above. Can you play a high-level bard without your epic? Yes. Are you truly effective at high-level without it? No. Our epic, unlike many of the others, is not just a status symbol. It completes our class at the high end. Without it you are relegated to providing manasong and mediocre buffs until level 60, when you get a disc that provide similiar capability for 2 min and then a nice long recycle time.<br>
<br>
I am not coming down on you per se, you are entitled to your opinion. But until you have experience playing a high level bard you can't claim to have knowledge that the bard epic is not necessary to be all you can be. If you have the experience of playing a high level bard, you simply realize that the epic adds signifigantly to your class.

I dont do it to benefit me.  Believe it or not I only started leading again (under a friends character) in hopes of giving some pallys and bards a shot at their epic pieces.  Whats in it for me?  NOTHING other than the reward of knowing that I was the one who made the effort to make it possible since no one else was leading.  Why would I want to lead Naggy?  I wouldnt... the only thing I could win is that Druid Crook and imho its a piece of shit... but I attend the raids to support the other raiders or the raid leader because its fun.  Try it... maybe you'll see there's more to the game than "total uberness and ph4t l3w7z"<br>
<br>
Let me give you an example of how I feel about loot.  I'll use Duec as an example (despite the whole Assassination thing) because he's one of the people I felt strongly about from the beginning.  He attended every one of my raids and did the pulling.  He also was the one person I could depend on to get corpses out of the pits.  He was also the one person who NEVER bitched about losing.  He would give the extra effort to manage corpse runs and even DIE when he didnt have to just to help others and every time an RBB would drop who do you think I would want to win it?  Duec.  I would have given my all to have seen him get that belt before he leveled.  Why?  Because he earned it.  And he is just ONE example of MANY people I would love to see walk away with something.  Look at people like Roark (ranger) who has been there for EVERY raid I have done... he always donates more than is expected and he always sticks through it through thick and thin... these people are the reason I enjoy doing this. (there are way way too many people who I could mention so dont think Im not grateful to the rest of you)<br>
<br>
I know bards and paladins who have been fighting with me from the start... even from back when Kerna was leading who still need their books and scales... I WANT THEM TO GET THEM.  This is one of the reasons I make the level min on the epics... they have earned it.  Not saying that the new pallys and bards who show havent because Im not trying to eliminate everyone Im just trying to make the odds better for the ones I have the highest hopes for. <br>
<br>
Yesterdays raids lasted over 14 hours... and what did I get out of it?  I got the satisfaction of seeing Glazier and Mogdar each get a pally book... and that made the whole night (despite the trials and tribulations) well more than worth it.  Seeing them two win their books meant more to me than any loot item I could have possibly gotten from that dragon.  Seeing my friends/guildees/and a number of people I dont know come out and give their all to make everything possible was the more rewarding than any "uber dragon loot item" I could have asked for.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because I play for fun, and one of my most rewarding parts of this game is helping people.  Seeing others who are giving and unselfish are the reason I play.  And its the whiney ass bastards who are so hung up on their own needs and wants that make me NOT want to give up my time, plat, and exp to help give the unselfish people an opportunity to win something they want or need.<br>
<br>
My level restrictions arent excluding everyone.  They are only there to help the people I know best, the people who have been with me the longest, and the people who are closer to being able to use the items better odds at winning.  There's still other stuff to win.  And there are always people who arent hung up on the loot who will come and support the raid to replace the arogant fucks who cant see past that.  If you feel that its ME holding you back then start bitching at people for not leading the raids at all.  Im not the only god damn person who can lead a successful dragon raid.  So why give me shit when I do and it doesnt meet your requirements?<br>
<br>
Last night I collected donations before Naggy to cover dot costs... at the end of the night I was over 400pp in the hole considering the number of people who dont donate and because I always buy WAY too many dots (just in case).  And its rather amuzing (not pointing fingers and Im not referring to Stan) how the majority of the whiney people who bitch at me about my loot rules (in tells and trust me I get tons of them) are the ones who have never given me a plat towards the cost of the raids.... hmmm... does that make me think my rules are unfair at all?  NO.  Im not bitching about the cost because I could care less... like I said before I do it for fun and having to fork out plat for dots/coffins is just one of the things I choose to do.  And there have been others (clerics who have used their own dots at their own expense or people who have brought their own coffins) who know its just part of the game and are willing to make those sacrifices.  And imho those are the people who I'd like to see walk away with a prize at the end of the night.  <br>
<br>
I've done raids with no restrictions and have seen a lvl 48 who I've never raided with before walk away with an epic item.  And then never see them again.  Does that make me feel rewarded?  Not really.  Does it make me feel as if higher level raiders were cheated out of an opportunity?  Yeah, it does.  Because those higher leveled raiders had put a lot more time and effort into getting their epic pieces (most of them atleast) and most of them are people I respect, and have raided with before, and those are the people that Im rooting for each and every one of them when it comes to winning.  Am I giving them an edge... you bet your ass I am.  Do I deserve to have people piss a fit over it?  No... go fuck yourself if you dont like it honestly because you are the people who are taking the fun out of what I do and frankly Im sick and tired of it.<br>
<br>
Those people who come with no expectations other than the ones having a good time and "POSSIBLY" walking home with an item are the people I will continue to fight for... the people who have to bitch are the reason I wont.  <br>
<br>
And its been said before and I'll say it again... Rather than bitching about my loot rules run your own raids, or go with someone else who leads them... but eat a dick before you decide to send me a tell, or post a rant with your feelings of my loot rules and how they are unfair to you or others... because I dont give a shit what you think.<br>

<br>
As far as Nag/Vox raids: It's simple if you can get the people to sign up and then more importantly show up, then do it. Run your own damn raid and set the loot rules how you think they should be. The loot rules Jex uses are tried and true and have been used by more raiders then her. If you don't like em don't attend her raids. You knew the score prior to going in. If you have anyone to point fingers at its yourself, not the leader of the raid. each and every raider is responsible to know the zone they are raiding and know the mobs they will be engaging. They also have the responsibility to know the posted and publicized raid rules and loot rules, and all of this PRIOR to the raid. If you think people will put up with Loot whiny pissy twerps in higher end raids you are sadly mistaken.  <br>
<br>
And Jex you have nothing to answer to or even need to reply to. Your loot rules are always posted, and people know the score. I say if they can't figure it out Fuck em.<br>

<br>
If you're reffering to my raids its because warriors do not have any need for a white dragon scale, the only purpose that I know of for the wds is for the bard epic or the white dragon scale cloak (wis/int caster cloak quest item). <br>
<br>
I dont do Naggy, in which case if I did the red dragon scale would be randomed to warriors and bards. <p><img src="http://jexielia.20megsfree.com/images/sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2785.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2785.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2785.topic&start=61&stop=62>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2795.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2775.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2785.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2785.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2785.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2785.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
