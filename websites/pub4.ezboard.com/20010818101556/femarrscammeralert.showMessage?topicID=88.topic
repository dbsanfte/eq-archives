Talking to him right now on phone and he just wants to say that your little &quot;Followers of Norrath&quot; guild was a joke.  It doesn't do much good to have a guild where more than half of the people in it are at least 5 levels higher than the leader.  He says you Gerran just wanted to have a sence of power and that there was not one good thing he ever witnessed in it.  You said that the guild was 30+ but once yoooou became 40 it was suddenly 40+...  <br>
<br>
Any guild where the leader is a newbie ( like you )  is not even worth joining.  Its not worth your time and efforts going on little stupid &quot;Raids&quot; as you called it to Kithicor where you just died in the first 10 minutes there.  <br>
<br>
So its not like he cares he was removed...   as i said i know him in RL and he also knows the owners of Pidnus ( was the owner but now owner of new accounts which you people do not know about so he can scamm away unnoticed ) and Elimer...   thanks to you people here and how immature and stupid the people who play the game he has become a full-time scammer and learning the ways of scamming from the owner of Pidnus...  he sees no other way to play the game other than to piss stupid people off and watch you guys cuss and flame away at your little computers all day over a game.<br>

A little 14 or 15 year old boy sitting at home.  Bored off his ass, sick of stroking off to JCPenney's bra ads, decides that he is going to take up a new hobby.  He is going to pick on all of those Everquest Nerds...hey its almost as much fun as trolling on AOL chat in the rape victims lounge and telling them all that they really liked it! <br>
<br>
fool<br>
<br>
You little boy, you will get out of life what you put into it. That goes for whether you believe in God, Karma, or a person that remembers your actions from a few years back and beats the everliving shit out of you.  <br>
<br>
But who am I kidding you are a child. You wont change. I am not saying every person your age is a child like you...not even close.  The majority of people your age have a great sense of value about themselves and do not need to belittle and ridicule others to make themselves feel good. <br>
<br>
People like you serve a great purpose in this world, REALLY no kidding.  You are a shining example of how totally fucked up someone can truly be.  Therefor you remind me every time you post how fucking glad I am that I am an adult and do not have to sit through days on end of people like you in school. I truly feel sorry for the people that go to school with you, I really do.  <br>
<br>
Personally I could give a flying monkey shit about you.  <br>
<br>
This is my problem with you though.  I have a guildy and friend that has to deal with little pieces of schmegma like you on a every day basis.  He is young and is in high-school.  I hear about crap like this almost every day from him.  About how &quot;I can't do that I would get teased for the it forever.&quot;  This is just about asking a girl out for Christ's Sake.  It is people like you that end up becoming bitter little trogs in adult-hood.  The people that everyone avoids as if they were the plague.  I hope you enjoy your 2 nanoseconds of fame in a pixilated world khockey19.  Because if you do not change you will have a long fucked up life to look forward to.<br>

<br>
  Seeing as you seem to believe that Followers of Norrath is a small, pissant little guild that you feel you can screw over, I'd just like to point out that you scammed a member of Storm's Fury.<br>
<br>
  Now, we're not going to do anything to you.  Frankly, we were unable to think of anything more hideous than the cruel tricks Nature has already played on you.<br>
<br>
  But you should be aware that we have spread the word about you to every guild we have contacts with.  Little, small ones like Midnights Sojourn, Da`Kor, Affliction, Umoja, Institute, hell even Drunken Pirates.<br>
<br>
  Your chance of joining these guilds, or grouping with any members of those guilds is now effectively 0.  I certainly hope that the Tolapumj Robe and Golden Chitin Bracers that you scammed are sufficient compensation for the knowledge that you'll have extreme difficulty finding a high-level guild or group willing to take you on.  <br>
<br>
  All actions have compensations:  In real life, if you pulled this crap you'd be in jail for fraud.  In Norrath, all we can do is restrict our interaction with you, and we shall.<br>
<br>
  Oh, and we will replace what you stole from our friend.  Because we actually like and care for people in this game, and because we're skilled enough to not NEED to scam items from people who don't speak English very well.  Have a nice life.<br>
<br>
  Oh, and Khockey?<br>

Since what you said is to everyone here correct in their PoV.  But put yourself in the scammers place...  why does one scamm?   <br>
<br>
Oh there are a few reasons:<br>
      1) To make 20+ kpp in about 10 minutes of time played<br>
      2) Proffiting from it  ( i have friends who bring in 200-500 $$ a week off this game)<br>
      3) Reading this board and laughing at everyone's little problems, and what they think they can change about the scammer.<br>
<br>
It is fucking hilariouse to sit here at my computer and check this board a few hours after i posted and see the utter disruption that is caused....<br>
<br>
You people just never will understand...  <br>
Its like a 5 yr. old bugging his little sister just to get attention...<br>
Its true scamming works in the same way but the problem is this: the people you scamm just dont &quot;grow out of it&quot; htye continue to give the scammer all the attention in the world that he wants and needs.  And what makes it even funnier is when it is an Adult (which i know most of you are : also the one above  ^  )    and they have nothing else to do after work (assuming they have time for work) but play everquest.<br>
<br>
It is so simple most of you people cannot understand it i guess.<br>

My advice? Just ignore him, and he'll eventually realize no one thinks he's cool (like he thinks he is) and he'll go away.<br>

secondly the guild has been 40+ now for about 6 weeks if yilnywen though such things about the guild why did this POS not leave.Thirdly thanks for all that have informed me about this jerk and i hope we dont see this ignorant POS again.Derrit u are absolutely right this guy is loving people reply to him. maybe he enjoys being a jerk, who knows???<br>

What sort of person gets a kick out of ripping someone off who cant speak proper english. If only everyone would help out and if laoke u want to give me a tell in game i would gladly help this guy in earning back what has been stolen from him.<br>

maybe a shool girl having a relationship with yilnywen.<br>
maybe a school boy having a relationship with yilnywen.<br>

What you're saying is that its perfectly reasonable to be a criminal.  You're saying its good and right to laugh at other people's misfortune and mistakes.  Oh, and that anyone who plays everquest and ISN'T scamming doesn't have a life.<br>
<br>
So in your mind EQ is for <br>
A)  No-lifers<br>
B) Scammers<br>
<br>
I hate to break it to you Khockey19, but real-life is what you make of it.  Playing EQ is a past-time, something to do to have fun with.  And if you scam someone, someone who maybe has played the game a year and spent $120 playing that year, you're ruining their hobby.  If you break someone's $120 model airplane for laughs, that's criminal.  Too bad its not officially criminal when you rip someone off in EQ...<br>
<br>
So what about reading and posting on this board?  How does it feel to be a troll on here when you could have a real-life and be somewhere else, like spending time with your girlfriend or just hanging with friends?<br>
Damn, I forgot, YOU don't have a life outside of this board or EQ, because you belong to the EQ Scammers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It must suck to have no girlfriend and no-lifer friends.  Oh yeah, they must be no-lifers cause they play EQ.  What?  You say they are the scammer types?  Well have you heard of the phrase 'there is no honor among thieves...'  Its going to be a real hoot when those scammer 'friends' of yours backstab you... Never fear, they'll do it, because its FUN to them.  Just like 5 year olds looking for attention... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Lets chat about your occupation a bit.  You could say that you've got a real job and just troll the boards when you're bored at work (like I do) but how can that be if you think that $200 a week is real money?  Ever try living off that?  Of course not, you live with mommie and daddie.  Too bad they don't know that you prefer the life of a criminal, preying on the naiveté of others.  (if you don't know what that word means, feel free to look it up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  But don't worry, you'll be out on your own soon enough, and then you'll have the satisfaction of seeing what real-life scammers are like when they use you real good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Oops, I almost forgot.  You really should get a dictionary or use a spell checker.  Its amazing how ignorant you look when you use that wonderful work 'fucking'  right next to 'hilariouse'.  Where did you ever learn how to spell 'hilariouse'?  Do you know what it means?  I don't.  I figure you meant 'hilarious', which is how I felt when I read your post.<br>
<br>
Have fun for now Khockey19, maybe one day you'll grow a pair and post your real name on here.  And please flame away.  I'd like to see if you can actually write a flame without resorting to swear words (but alas, it would take you too long to look all those words up.)<br>

I said YOU died thats right YOU.  &lt;Moron&gt;<br>
<br>
Oh and the Burningwood raid?  Yes he heard about that and yes it was a pointess one...   he was on that night and i talked to him, it was another pointless &quot;raid&quot; for the Wurmslayer quest...  no one got enough scales to even complete it...  2 good hours wasted.<br>
And you might say it was a good time to have with guildies??   that's what they made guildtalk for so he did not miss a thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Oh and one other thing..  why join an Uber guild?  no point...   people who play that long are stupid...  you look at how many days they have played and its sick!<br>
100+ days played!  thats like smoking your life away.  just stupid.  anyways  there is no need to join a high level guild b/c it is mainly for items anyways at that level and why waste your time fighting for them?  just heard to EC and in 10 minutes BOOM  you can have one for free!<br>
<br>
Oh and he does not care about not having a guild b/c he is never gonne need one for anything...  all he plays for is like 10 minutes a day if that and makes his money <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushadowwize.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowWize</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 565<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/22/01 1:12:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Sounds like a plan</span><hr size=1> Maybe you could both sit down and write one of those get rich quick books... you know the ones I am talking about right?  Place tiny ads in newspapers and make 3000.00 a week.  Buy real estate with no money down and triple your investment over night?<br>
<br>
Or.. you could spend the time the same way you do on a Friday or Saturday night already.  Sitting around with your equally succussful friends and seeing who can tell the biggest lie.  You know the ones that start with.. I have this one friend.. except thats the lie.  Not what your friends supposedly did that was so impressive, but the fact they exist at all.<br>
<br>
Face it man.. any one who takes on the karma you do intentionally can't be all that bright.  God knows they will never be successful at anything more than deluding themselves.  Why not save the world the expense of paying for your incarceration at a later date and just leave the plastic bag around your head a little bit longer while you are autoeroticly asphixiating yourself.  It would be so easy bro.  One extra stroke and the world is a better place.<br>
 <br>
Think about it man.  Its a viable alternative to the 60 years of lameness ahead of you.<br>

P.s. Let me correct you of the idea that I hate you right now.  I dont.  I just think it would be easier this way for all of us.<br>
<br>
P.P.S.  Seat belts are for wussies.  Dont let any one tell you different<br>

I bet if u came to doing it to someone you knew you wouldnt have the guts. Khockey you are a 10 year old kid who can only rip of people in other parts fo the country over the computer because u wouldnt dare do it to anyone near you because you would get your ass kicked you little POS.<br>
<br>
As for trying to tell me aboutmy guild go get a life u little jerk. If there anyone who doesnt like my guild they will leave so its none of your busness.<br>
<br>
Why would anyone want to heard to EC khockey?? maybe u need your dictionary again. i doubt many people here would even head to ec to rip someone off because there not all little POS like u jerk.<br>

He claims to know this person and that person. He gets to talk to them in school! He talks to them on the phone and can type at the same time! He must be a multitasking freak! He spouts off how he knows bla bla and bla bla and how they scam people and thinks its cool.<br>
<br>
khockey19, you have got to be the biggest bullshitter I have ever heard of. You sound like one of those bitches that claims to know all these people and tell stories about them just to fit in or at least try to. Do us all a favor and go sit in the highway with your PC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushsmattwilson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SHS Matt Wilson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/28/01 1:07:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Some of Khockey's inspirations</span><hr size=1> <center><img src="http://somethingawful.efront.com/inserts/news/images/blankad.gif"></center><br>
