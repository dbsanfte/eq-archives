I was hanging around the docks killing <br>
the odd MOB and handing out heals and buffs when needed, when I got an invite to join a group hunting at the <br>
Orc Camp. I had not played much in full groups before this and since the group had a cleric and a druid, <br>
I was not too sure of my role outside of buffing and back up healing.<br>
The next couple of hours were fast and furious and frankly confusing for me as we seemed to be constantly <br>
pulling groups of Orcs. The text window seemed to be moving faster than I could read it<br>
I thought that using the shamans DOTs and the slam skill to disrupt the casters would allow me to contribute.<br>
I soon got low on mana but stayed on my feet bashing away at the orc casters or whatever was nearest.<br>
Eventually the leader advised me to sit down until I had mana, I sat for a while but was soon back to my old <br>
tricks.<br>
At one point the enchy glared at me - what had I done wrong?<br>
Also the paladin asked if had assist hotkeyed, I hadn't so I set it up there and then, I even used it a couple <br>
of times.<br>
I thought we were doing great no-one died, we were getting good exp and loot and plenty of fighting action, <br>
so I was a little disappointed when the leader announced he was disbanding the group.<br>
Then I realised that everyone was still around and pulling again - why aren't we grouped I asked?<br>
They were grouped I was not.<br>
I got a tell from the druid saying that they would not let me rejoin, I thanked him for telling me and asked why<br>
and soon got a tell from the leader explaining that I had been breaking mezzes, not assisting the tanks and generally <br>
being unavailable to heal or buff when required cos I was always oom and generally acting like an idiot.<br>
I said that I wished someone had said something before kicking me out.<br>
<br>
He reminded me that he had told me to med when I was oom, the enchy had asked me not to break her mezzes<br>
(I have to admit that at the time I did not know what this meant), and the paladin had asked me to assist, <br>
but that I had ignored them all. He finished by advising me to learn how to play in groups if I intended to <br>
keep playing.<br>
I was feeling angry and upset at this point, still not totally convinced that there was much wrong with the way<br>
I played, but I bit my tongue, thanked him for the advice and wished the group well as I ran off to lick my psychic wounds.<br>
For the next week, I went back to soloing in the Karanas - who needs groups anyway.<br>
On one occasion I was being chased by a group of mobs to the bridge. A relatively high level enchanter tried to help me out but explained to me that my DOTs meant the mobs kept breaking his mezzes and that the mobs would then agro on him.<br>
The penny dropped - no wonder the enchy in that group had got so mad at me.<br>
I have also now learned the efficiency of assisting the main tank, the value of having mana even as backup <br>
healer and the importance of listening and responding to the people in group.<br>
The experience of being thrown out of a group is not pleasant, but I think with the 'Don't tell me how to <br>
play my character' attitude I had then they had very little choice but to exclude me.<br>
Perhaps if the experience had been less painful, it would have had less impact on me and I would still be making<br>
the same mistakes and building a bad reputation for myself.<br>
When 5 other people think you are doing wrong, chances are that you are doing wrong.<br>
Now of course I make a whole new set of mistakes, but that is another story.<br>

They might have been gits, in which case I am sure the group would have suffered a few deaths, in this case <br>
the group knew what it was doing and compensated for my poor group play. They also told me at the time what <br>
I should be doing (not that I listened!) and took the time to explain the problems to me afterwards.<br>
I have been in the occasional group where I thought the group were wrong and I was right (a group that managed<br>
to lose two healers and a bard in quick succession by overpulling comes to mind), but if a well functioning <br>
group thinks I should adapt my play I listen.<br>
<br>

You got that spot on! I had been mainly soloing up to that point in the game, since then most of my time has<br>
been spent in LOIO and I usually group. I can solo there but now I am getting the hang of it I much prefer <br>
the non-stop action and fun that a good group can provide and I have adjusted my chatfilters and text colours<br>
so I don't miss important info (usually).<br>

Thanks your article gave me a bit more insight into the enchanter's playing options.<br>
Since the events in the story above I have been in quite a few groups with enchanters and I am always glad that <br>
they are there - even the least skilled enchy can help with mana production!<br>
With an enchy supplying breeze/clarity I can heal and buff all day and I can still use my lovely DOTs as <br>
long as I hit that assist button first(-:<br>
I do believe that the shaman and enchanter complement each other well, if they each have some understanding<br>
of the best ways to work together.<br>
<br>
Thanks for responding to my first post on these boards, it concerned an event that left a strong impact on me and forced a more profound re-evaluation of my playing style<br>
than anything else that has happened to me IG so far.<br>

<br>
As a general rule, when you join a group ask the classes that are in the group.  You can find out if there are any duplicate classes.  For example, if there are two other healers you would be able to keep more offensive spells up.  If there is another of your class you can get with them to see what you should cast, that way you don't have to waste mana and time when spells don't stack.<br>
<br>
Ask questions.  If you don't understand what something means or don't know how, ask away and you should be able to get a response.  If no one in my group can explain it to me then i probably don't want to be there anyhow.<br>
<br>
Use the chat filter to turn of other's hits and misses, damage sheilds, and bard songs.  To an even greater extent you can turn off other's casting messages.  This will make the chat screen crawl a bit more, and you can read whatever is coming across easily.  This will provide especially useful when you start doing large raids later on.<br>
<br>
Lastly, don't take it all personally.  The group, had they been a little more forward and wanted to get the point across, could have stopped pulling and made sure that you understood.  Then instead of 5 people in the group doing a good job, there could have been 6 people in the group doing a great job. <p><a href><marquee behavior=alternate><table width="100"  border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" height="30">

You made mistakes and had backbone to step up.. admit it.. and inform others.. Bravo.  I agree it sounds like a case of Solo-itis.  You've fought by yourself up to this point where your goal was.. DUMP MANA.. kill it before it kills me. <br>
<br>
Group environment is VERY different.  This is what really gets Necros into trouble.  They're so solo oriented that most players never learn how to work in a group environment and suck at the endgame.  Your method of playing wasn't wrong (except for breaking mezzes).. it just wasn't right for a group.<br>
<br>
ALWAYS find out your job when you join the group.  Will you be buffer, main healer, backup healer, DOTs, crowd control, etc?  <br>
<br>
If there are two of you (same class) split the jobs and make sure you aren't casting the same spells. (I cast venom of snake on Mob_01.  Then you cast VoS on Mob_01.  We have both wasted the mana for the spell.. but the mob only has ONE Venom of Snake spell draining its life.)  IMPORTANT:  this is only for debuffers and DOTs.  DD's (direct damage spells) do their damage instantly so feel free to use the same nukes (DD's) as other people.<br>
<br>
To the rest of us, we were ALL new once and had no clue what in the hell our class was for.. lol.. well.. maybe the meatshields (but we love you anyways).  If someone in your group is obviously not with the program... try taking a second to educate them.  Maybe they are not just sucking exp.. but honestly know no better.  Because we are playing an alt for kicks doesn't mean everyone is.<br>

Seriously, this is part of the learning process that msot players go through.  Sometimes we have to eat a little humble pie.  It's worth it though.  And advice from an Enchanter like Whim, who is a VERY good enchanter is very helpful.  I've seen too many level 60 types that couldn't be bothered with someone in their 20's.  Kudos, Whim.. Your class and concern for others is a real credit to your personal character.  Proud to know you. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56622>My Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usueno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sueno</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.sigma.net/fafhrd/icon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/6/02 9:53:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8552.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Hard Lesson</span><hr size=1> Sweetie, learning the tricks of the game take some time, but if you'd like I'd be more than willing to sit back with you anywhere you want and hepl you learn. Different ppl play shammys in different ways. Most play the group (buff and slow) type, but there are those who play battle shaman. <br>
<br>
There are a couple of websites dedicated to the Shaman Class that are fairly decent.<br>
If you'd like some one on one or group training just send me a /tell in game as either Sueno or Artillary, or send me an email [email]sueno@sigma.net[/email] and we'll set up a time and place to go kick butt Shaman style.<br>
<br>
This goes for anyone else as well.<br>
Alot of the older players sometimes forget how long it took them to learn those nifty little tricks.<br>
If anyone wants a little help, just give me a /tell or send me an email.<br>

<br>
A good example of this is a high level dungeon called howling stones.  Low hitpoints, things don't hit all that hard, and they die rather fast.  Why waste mana slowing AND mesmerizing, when we can just engage 2-4 things at once, with me playing AE songs, and stick some nice damage shields on everyone ... then all you gotta do is slow, and save the mana you'd normally have used for mesmerizing it all.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, some people get stuck in that mindset so much that when I try to explain how to do it, people get lost and/or continue with their old re-hashed-beat-into-the-ground tactics until I'm ready to jump out and start pushing my experience bar myself.<br>

<br>
Quite frankly, I am impressed with your post - your first on this forum I also noticed. It is refreshing to see someone post something positive and educational rather than a flame and hateful. It is even more impressive to see others respond in a positive way. Far too often we (for I will also include myself) tend to strike out in flames.<br>
<br>
My experience was very similar to your own while I "grew up" in my levels. I started off with a half elf warrior and parked him at level 35 before starting my barbarian shammy. My shammy, a level 51, is my main character and one I truly enjoy playing. Now that I am guild master of my guild, I like to give out advice to our younger guild members, especially our shammys, because I would prefer they not go through the "school of hard knocks" like I did. A shammy can solo fairly easily through about level 40, then things get a bit difficult. After you have soloed Cynthia in the Rathe Mountains at level 40, you will find groups a necessary evil. But I like to think of groups as one of the funnest parts of EQ. When you are in a group that is truly ROCKIN, where experience is flowing faster than a drunks bladder (nice visual eh?), you can literally step back and watch the magic.<br>
<br>
I could continue my philosophical monologue, but I will cut it short. Silibili, if you are looking for a guild I want to talk to you. You are exactly the kind of person we seek. And if you aren't interested, I wish you all the success in the world. Send tell to me if you want advice on questing totemic armor or you want to start work on your epic.<br>

I have to say, after seeing your tag pic, I am now lusting after you intensely! Very nice graphic and classy too. If you tell me that is a real self portrait, I will drop dead on the ground faster than being summoned by Cazic Thule.<br>

<br>
Whim,<br>
<br>
I read your information about being an enchanter. Great stuff! Would you give me permission to post it on my guild's website? I am always looking for material that can enhance the EQ experience and your chanter guide certainly qualifies. I would love to see you add to it beyond level 40.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, that is all I had to say for now. Keep up the great work and I hope to see more threads like this one.<br>
