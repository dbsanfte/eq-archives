<br>
Server: E-Marr (what good is slander if you only put it in one place eh?)<br>
<br>
I have included a log, but that will be of little use I know, as the start of the problem is not on thier. just the end and my discussion with an officer.  I doubt any thing will be done by the tone of the conversation, as such I will post this.<br>
Next a bit of back ground history. <br>
All of this takes place in chardok. minus a few zones due to death.<br>
I logged on for a simple night of XP and fun.  zone into chardok to find some people I know, Varanuss, Geneiveve, and logical grouped at entrance making a path.  so I join them.  we decide we should move down in front of the fort and pull a few out.  our progress is some what slow due to helping out a person or two. we do make it down to the bottom of the zone in.  <br>
from no where comes 10 or so sarnaks.  we still cannot figure out what caused that.  two members die.  ok, I collect corpses, we res and start back down.  <br>
as we get close to the bottom 3 other PC's have zoned in and just kinda follow us must of the way down, Popplo, Xanagg, Baxtin (I belive it was baxtin with them but I could not be 100% sure as I was not paying close attention) .  when we get to the bottom and pull on or two, they run into the front of the fort and start killing what is thier.<br>
Now onto the problems.<br>
our monk decides to go up and grab two and pull them arround.  well unfortunatly, he could not quite pull it off. as he is coming back, with the cleric casting a heal, one of his pulles nuked and killed him. after that they move to attack the MF members standing thier killing somthing else.  one of thier members dies Xanagg to be exact.  both corpses are collected, and resed by Geneiveve.<br>
At this point Popplo states &quot;if you try to pull through us again I will @#%$ train your ass into (some silly coment I cannot remeber)&quot;<br>
I replied with &quot;Stop taking about training I could just pull the whole place on us all&quot; perhpas out of line, but I take badly to threats.<br>
Aparently Varanuss and Popplo got into some sort of a discussion although I know not of what was said.  our group decided it was not worth the hassle, and we did not want to kill any one again, so we moved back to the zone in, where we could kill in pace.<br>
after about two kills thier is a shout by popplo, &quot;OMG Look out Train!!&quot;<br>
Well aparently no one informed numb nuts that we had moved as he trained the zone out.  Had we not moved it would have hit us.<br>
A few min. go by, and here comes popplo walking back down from the zone in. he stops for a second looking at us and walks back into the fort. followed shortly by&quot;OMG Look out Train!!&quot;<br>
I FD. as I watch popplo run out of the fort and stand over us.  apearently the mobs at this point have gotten tierd of popplo's @#%$ as nothing followes him.  (I turned log on right here).  popplo stands over us for a few seconds (he had leve and ran off the ledge from inside the fort). before running back into the fort.<br>
Who can guess what happend next?  thats right, amazingly enugh a Level 60 monk who found the zone out about 2 minuts ago some how got lost getting back and ran to the zone in, with his reaquierd train.  one of which hapend to me an wizard.  Well the AE grav flux as you might well be aware cancelled my FD.  I died.<br>
<br>
I at this point started a conversation with a MF member.  I did a who all 60 war to find some one in MF, not untill I started looking up who all I was involved with did I realize I had randomly chosen thier guild leader.  I had a concersaton with Dabiggun about Popplo's behavior.<br>
<br>
I wright this now, just to inform you of what a compleat ass Popplo is, and to ask you.  Please, do not ever assist this person.  if you know me, you know me to be a person of high standards. I do not ask much of my freinds, or people that I know. Yet I am always thier to help any time you should ask.<br>
<br>
Even though his claim is some what justified for training us, as apearently some hot words went between him and varanuss, What did he hope to accomplish?  I am sorry your frined.  a level 60 secondary got killed.  But you tried to train a group over what a monk said.  looking for reveng?  great way to do it.  train a @#%$ monk.  the only ones you are going to kill are the ones who did not say any thing to you, and the ones that did res your freind.  Think about it for about 30 seconds Popplo, I am sure will see the futility in trainig a monk.  I have been infomed by some inside sourcces that, although you act like a child you might know somthing about the monk class.  ok, I give up let me break it down for your simplistic mind.  Monks can FD. hence the reason they pull alot. not only can they FD, but they can FD while mobs are hitting them under most circumstances, as they do not have to worry about beeing interuped.  the cleric and mage can gate, only if they manage to get the spell off.  where as I beeing a necro can do both. although I personaly perfere to keep FD memed as opposed to gate for agro controll reasons mainly.<br>
<br>
I have included the log, which does have the conversation between myself and Dabiggun, as well as Popplo's refusal to even so much as apologize, or respond to me.<br>
I must finaly add. In all of my EQ carrier I have never met some one who acted as badly as popplo did.  I feel sorry for any member of MF to have to have him as a guild member.  I trully do pitty that they must not only put up with him as a member but as an officer.  I can only imagine the decisions that some one who acts like this must make. if you are thinking about joining this guild, just rember, This person will be the one you have to deal with in case of problems.<br>
To any MF member I ask, are all of your officers this stupid?  your guild leader does not seem to be from my conversation with him, yet he does know how popplo acts, and accepts it, so perhaps I am wrong in my judgment of Dabiggun.<br>
Here is a slightly edited log (alot of battle span was cut as I use others hits mode, and some one was handing in 4 stacks of salts and skins while I was talking to Dabiggun).  I apologize if I missed any thing important, and if you would like the full unedited version simply let me know your e-mail address and I will send it ( oh yea I see a huge request for that borring @#%$ coming )<br>
as a side note. every one I have spoken to knows popplo. the best coment I heard about him is that he is a true dick.<br>

<br>
Finaly I would like to say, Yes my group members did do wrong. but no where near the point to what this got esclated to.  and the only way I could possibly take dabigguns advice would be to folow thier guild arround and train them the next time they decide to raid somthing. because I would need to make sure that Popplo's freinds die, not him.  Not somthing I will do, but just pointing out how dumb that sounds.<br>

<br>
<br>
We were holding the camp but having a little trouble...no chanter, clarity, etc(using the necro for crowd control)<br>
<br>
A group of 3 then started pulling mobs from our camp, and pulled a couple adds onto us in the middle of a fight. The group was Popplo, Baxtin, Xannag. They were all /anon.<br>
<br>
I was rather perturbed about this so we finished off our mob and the adds they dragged onto us. We were getting behind on spawns and adds were going to start piling up soon so I went ahead and pulled the Captain PH. I assumed since none of these guys were KOS that I would be able to pull the PH through them with no problems...and to tell you the truth I wasn't terribly concerned for the safety of a group that just barreled thru our camp and pulled adds on us a moment before. <br>
<br>
As I was pulling the mob to our camp...one of the mobs they were fighting nuked me for 600 and killed me. The mobs I was pulling then aggroed back on them and killed their shammy.<br>
<br>
To be honest I didn't give a crap that one of them died because they were rude enough to just waltz through our camp and start pulling our mobs and aggroing others onto us. So yea...at the time Popplo came and started talking Dirty Harry to me I was heated(please bear that in mind because yea I said some rude things but they earned it IMO).<br>
<br>
Geneiveve got some screenshots of the ensuing confrontation:<br>

*********************************************************************<br>
<br>
His first attempt at training us failed(he pulled it to the zone out and we had moved to the right of the guardstation):<br>
<br>
http://www.netwalk.com/~loki/popplo4.jpg<br>
<br>
Again, a little later:<br>
<br>
http://www.netwalk.com/~loki/popplo5.jpg<br>
<br>
This one he managed to pull some high level Sarnaks onto us. We were ready for it so Gene and Logic gated. Umbrae tried to FD but it was broken by AoE and she died. I FD'd and lived. <br>
<br>
Needless to say, we petitioned and /reported and a GM came too late.<br>
<br>
Umbrae sent tells to Dabiggun of Midnight Fury(Popplo's guild)...Dabiggun's response was:<br>
<br>
"Train him back"<br>
<br>
A witness had this to say:<br>
<br>
[Fri Apr 26 06:20:00 2002] Speedi tells you, 'just act like he is not bothering you, like I did and he will go away, just like any trouble maker'<br>
<br>
I am not saying that I was entirely justified in telling him "@#%$ happens"...but he shouldn't have been moving through our camp to begin with.  When people piss me off I will tell them to f uck off...it's the way I am, sue me.  <br>
<br>
However...Popplo's intentionally training us was WAY over the line.  If I am guilty of anything it is badly judging the aggro on a mob.  /shrug<br>
<br>
One inaccuracy I found in Umbrae's post was that she felt we were still moving down to the camp and they moved past us...when in fact, we had already broken the camp and were set up in it.  All mobs in the camp were down except the one we were fighting and the PH itself.<br>
<br>
I really didn't want to bring this here but apparently it wound up here anyway.  Believe what you want about my intentions....the proof of Popplo's is right there in the screenshot.<br>

Even after reading your log l was quite dissapointed to see that the herbalist who l had origanally pulled to start that train did not make it to zone. And ln hindsight l did not utilize the   *trade with them while the train comes*  Tactic that such mythic trainers as Hothgar and Bubu have used in times past. Unfortuanatly l have let them down trying to follow in there wake but hey l tried. <br>
     <br>
      Now on a side note lt was 2 of my group that died. And when l said to whoever that iksar monk was hey man don't pull threw us. All l got was a &quot; You come pulling threw my camp you get what you get&quot; .  A simple &quot;my bad&quot; woulda been fine. Not to mention how the @#%$ am l sposed to go anywhere l mean jesus christ your faggot group was camping the entrance? Where am l sposed to pull threw? Sorry l can't be some lamer fag and camp at the zone but my Whopping group of 3 decided to go in.<br>
<br>
      Seriously, l don't even need to justify the means. Anyone l know that got the responce l got from that fag you call a monk who was in your group would train you l am sure. You were simply &quot;collateral damage&quot;. And l wouldn't hesitate to do it again. And might next time l see that monk. <br>

<br>
  Yes, Popplo is an ass.  I think he'd be the first to agree with you on that.  And the chance of him ever needing assistance is, well, laughable.<br>
<br>
  I heard this from Popplo's viewpoint when it happened, and as such my view is biased.  Also, I'm in Popplo's guild.  So let me say this first:<br>
<br>
  Actions have consequences.  Had not Varanuss trained Popplo's group and killed 2 of the 3 members, none of this would have happened.  If Varanuss had apologised for his actions, none of this would have happened.  You want to @#%$ with Popplo?  He has never, ever made any secret of the fact he's an @#%$.  He's fiercely loyal to his friends, and he gets more than a little narked when people do stupid, avoidable things that get them killed.<br>
<br>
  What Popplo did was not what I would have done in the same circumstances.  I would have likely shrugged it off.  But he's his own person, and I don't see how I have the right to inflict my moral code on him.<br>
<br>
  Bottom line:  don't @#%$ with Popplo.  It is NOT worth the time.  Killing him is fine.  He doesn't mind that.  Killing his friends with a stupid, avoidable mistake and not apologising for it?  <br>
<br>
  I'd advise you chalk it up to a painful lesson in humility.  <br>
<br>

<br>
  Yes, this could have all been avoided if both parties had communicated... but they didn't.. Popplo's group pulled up to us without a word pulled adds on to us then proceded to the center part of the castle.. a simple "hey we're moving to the bridge be out of the way in a min" was all that was needed from them.. like most courteous groups when paths cross. <br>
  A simple apology wouldn't have been necessary if a simple "excuse me" had been made. <br>

<br>
  But still, one has to admit that when you kill someone in a group other than yours, one should NOT pack an attitude unless you want one back in your teeth.<br>
<br>
When I've done it in the past I've apologised profusely (usually because I'm hideously embarassed) and done my level best to organise resses / CR for the group in question.  If I have the time I'll also stick around for a bit and powerlevel them.<br>
<br>
  Yet again, that's just my way of doing things and I fail to see that I have the right to insist you do it that way.  But I'd point out again that actions have consequences.  Had you behaved in a more, well, professional manner rather than throwing your toys out of the cot, then likely it would have been sorted on the spot and we'd all have forgotten about it tomorrow.<br>

  If Popplo is stupid, give me a guild full of mongolian retards who can't drool and walk at the same time please.<br>
<br>
  Disrespectful to people who haven't earned his respect?  I'll grant ya that one.  Rude, crude, and lewd?  Guilty as charged.  Loyal as all hell?  You betcha.  Smarter than the average bear?  <br>
<br>
Well, he's in Midnight Fury, and not Storm of Dragons.  I think that speaks volumes for his inteligence really.<br>

<br>
Now THAT is a bullshit response.  Be careful Laoke, you are starting to sound as pompous as Popplo.  <br>
<br>
I know you have to defend your friends but look at what you are defending:<br>
<br>
He admitted to training us.  He admitted he pulled through our camp without a word of warning.<br>
<br>
You are saying exactly this:<br>
<br>
It's OK to train if you are an @#%$ by nature.<br>
It's OK to train if you are "smart enough" to be in Midnight Fury.<br>
<br>
I'm somewhat of an @#%$ by nature, but I didn't intentionally train them(I just basically pulled a mob and assumed that I had enough aggro to move it through them).   Why?<br>
<br>
Because it's NOT OK to train people no matter who you are.<br>
<br>
As for earning your respect Laoke I honestly don't care about the respect of someone who plays the same video game as I.<br>
<br>
But truth be told, I respect you.  I respect your posts on the monk boards and I almost have always agreed with what you have to say.  I've actually used your advice on a few occasions.<br>
In this thing you are letting friendship cloud your judgement.  You have just insulted a whole group of people(my guild) for no reason whatsoever than to defend your arrogant ass of a friend.<br>

One other point - I was under the impression that the group cleric Genevieve provided rezzes for the MF person/people ? That counts as an apology of sorts surely?

It's OK to train if you are &quot;smart enough&quot; to be in Midnight Fury.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Point out to me exactly where I said, or implied that please?<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting.<br>
<br>
What I am saying is that actions have consequences. You killed 2 out of 3 members of Popplos group. You @#%$ up and they died as a result of your incompetance. Then, you pack an attitude and say 'It's not my fault'. You deny responsibility. <br>
<br>
That is what infuriates me, on so many levels. You where the direct cause of something and yet you have the balls to stand there and say &quot;I did nothing wrong&quot;. If you did nothing wrong, then I would be the first to say Popplo was outta line.<br>
<br>
For the love of the Goddess, take responsibility for your actions damnit!<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>

<br>
Actually, I did it for a very specific reason. That statement I made could be taken many ways: either he's too smart to be in Storm of Dragons... or not smart enough. The implication could be, I agree, that as a guild Storm of Dragons is barely smart enough to realise that fire is hot. However, I don't really think this is the case. <br>
<br>
However, your friend Umbraes statement &quot; To any MF member I ask, are all of your officers this stupid?&quot; could be taken the same way. Boot hurts on the other foot, doesn't it? Umbrae insulted Midnights Fury, so I gave a little payback. Look back on my posts: I gave you ample room to avoid hanging yourself. You could have shut the @#%$ up. You could have admitted partial responsibility. You could, for the love of god, apologised for killing his group. You chose to do none of these things.<br>
<br>
So be it. If you chose to act in a childish and thoughtless manner I have no problems with holding a mirror up to you.<br>
<br>

<br>
Nope. You're letting your pride cloud yours. A pride, I might add, that seems to be digging you deeper every post you make.<br>
<br>
Popplo's not blameless here.  I'd be the first to admit that.  My main point is that you could have avoided this so very, very simply... but you decided that you weren't going to take any crap from Mr 60th Level Uber-Guild Member.<br>
<br>
  Those consequences of your actions can be a real bitch, can't they?<br>

I'm still trying to see the consequences here.  <br>
<br>
Laoke, it is YOU who are digging yourself deeper.  You are ranting now without a foot to stand on.  <br>
<br>
I feel no need to apologize for something that could have been avoided by him bearing some semblance to a human being.<br>
<br>
"You @#%$ up and they died as a result of your incompetance. "<br>
<br>
Never had a bad pull Laoke?  With 2 years as a classical guitar major and first chair in my school ensemble forgive me if your insult to my competence in a video game leaves me feeling more amused than dismayed.<br>
