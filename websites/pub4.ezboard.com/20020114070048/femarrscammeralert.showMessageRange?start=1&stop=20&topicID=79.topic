<br>
Well to start things off, SOMEONE hacked PIDNUS' account and stole all his stuff.<br>
<br>
Apparently he got his just desert.<br>
<br>
Well, I log on and i get a /tell from a character named Sigone. He tells me that he is Pidnus.<br>
<br>
Then he proceedes to swear, cuss, and call me all types of names. He tells me that the hacker told him that ~I~ was the one who hacked his account, and that he was talking to several GMs and Valtron and they are going to cancell my account.<br>
<br>
Of course this is all shocking to me, so I petition. I speak with a senior guide who tells me that he has -no clue- about this, and that he was going to ask around. So I sit there and wait for a response. During this time i am getting tells from Sigone telling me that I was a jerk and a scammer and that he was going to post to all the message boards. So I /report him. About a minute later the Guide /tells me that he told Valtron about the situation and that someone would get back to me soon, because if Valtron wanted me, he would have contacted me as soon as I got on. At this time Sigone tells me that he is talking to the leader of my guild and getting me kicked out. So I do a /who all looking for the leader and any of his twinks. None on. I /tell him that and he falls silent. A little while later he asks me what type of neck armor I am wearing. I was wearing a Ry'Gorr neck peice, so I tell him this. He falls silent (I guess he was trying to see if I was wearing the same type of armor he USED to have). About 5 min later he logs off. <br>
<br>
I'm still waiting to hear from a GM (this is happening in the present, im AFK in game and typing this on another computer). I just wanted to post this in case he tried to log in here and say something about me.<br>
<br>
Figures, the servers biggest a-hole finally gets his just desert and now he's trying to frame me.<br>

What I am thinking is that the person who stole it back reads these boards (he knew Derrit's name).  If that person were to find out who all the items belonged to, yet remain annonymous, he would acquire many friends.<br>
<br>
Now, who wants to bet it was his little scam side-kick, E something... hah.<br>
<br>
I wonder if we will see the pos with his gear tomorrow... who knows.  Maybe its a new scam to double all his present equip AND get people mad at Derrit.<br>

One day I was passing through Freeport and he was cussing that<br>

<br>
He was claiming that his whole life was in that bag<br>

Not really a scam mind you but a Ploy to get items<br>
from people that feel sorry for his loss.<br>

Where are your manners?<br>
<br>
Let me let you in on a little secret.<br>
<br>
Pidnus = Bulok = Soultyrant = Signoe<br>
<br>
Signoe is awfully similar to Sigone.<br>
<br>
Next secret? Pidnus does read these boards. He knows all about this thread and all the others but he accepts the fact that everyone on them hates him with good reason. He also thins he's not doing anything wrong.<br>
<br>
Unlike some I have to admit that Pidnus does have some brains. He's scammed people in so many different ways and for so much and he knows when to keep his mouth shut.<br>
<br>
So Pidnus...cos I know your reading this. How does it ache your soul to know that everyone hates you? That you choose a game to occupy so much of your time and that almost each and every one of your chosen peers wouldn't even piss on your gums if your teeth were on fire?<br>
<br>
How does it make you feel inside when you lie awake in bed knowing that the few friends you have in real life think of you in this way. Because for all your money and all your soloed levels nobody actually wants to be with you. Not even your closest friends in real life respect you.<br>
<br>
When will you realise that the amount of cash in your bank is directly proportionate to your lack of companionship? That each and every day you get further from social interactiion into the realms of deep psychosis where you actually think your harming nobody and your just playing YOUR game so we should just let YOU be?<br>
<br>
I tell you this. You're a fucking limp dicked, no guts, coward. I dare you...AND I KNOW YOU READ THIS....I dare you to reply. Go head to head with me, one on one, in an open defence of your actions. <p><HTML><CENTER>

        maybe you saw me in ECommons today stalking my next victem?  or was I in your group?!  <br>
<br>
I think i'll let you guys decide <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uelimergluestick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elimer Gluestick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/13/01 7:45:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pidnus, Yilnywen, i know the truth!</span><hr size=1> Well, Elimer here, the one you all call Pidnus scamming-sidekick even though i have never scammed anything in EQ which is the funny part...  Pidnus is sigone etc. he will take on many forms, best advice, dont' fall for dumb shit like that folks...if he's got a thread this big then you should be learning by now he's not one to be trusted.  So what happened is Pidnus scammed somones account and about a week later somone scammed his account, whatever, he got what he deserved.  Now Pidnus is supposedly playing on other servers (from what he told me), apparently he's letting his old account go and he's buying new ones off ebay, so there is no way of protecting yourself form the pidnus, just dont' fall for it... As for yilnywen, yeah he's not the brightest, i know Yilnywen AND pidnus in RL, they're 2 diff people, and they're the 2 biggest scammers...for some reason i'm not proud, hopefully for all of you who have grouped with me I'm not a prick like that...But as for yilnywen he's not an incredible scammer, but he did pull that one off a couple days ago.  I apologize for both of their actions, they have made Erolissi hell to play on butsometimes they'r alright in RL :P  I figured i might as well post something because i have let all of you accuse me of enough with the Pidnus related stuff and now with Yilnywen don't go calling me the scamming-sidekick.  So whatever, later all, Elimer signing off... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukhockey19.showPublicProfile?language=EN>khockey19</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/13/01 7:51:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bravo!</span><hr size=1> Bravo!

But beware of those who lurk in the Shadows of those before them and learn from other's and their own mistakes...<br>

We can only get better at our trade skill.<br>

Something to think about <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualekzandr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alekzandr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/13/01 11:26:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bravo!</span><hr size=1> Wow I feel so much better after reading Khockey's post. I had begun to think that maybe my life was missing something cause I enjoy playing this game ALOT, but after seeing someone who seems from his own to derive personal value from scamming people I do feel much better.<br>

PS Nice little self dramatization with your talk of lurking in the shadows and such very THE SHADOWesque <p><img
