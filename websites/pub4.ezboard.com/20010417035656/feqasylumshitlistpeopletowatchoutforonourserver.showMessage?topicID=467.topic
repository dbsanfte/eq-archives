<br>
As leader, I invited him into group at Giant Fort in FM.  I explained loot rules as FFA, split off, roll on weapons, tunic, cap and Forest Loops.  We get lucky and I see the red text that Munden has looted a Forest Loop, so I tell the group to roll... Munden immediately sits down while three of us roll (one gets a 100 *sigh*, one afk and one off pulling), then stands up and PORTS to EC.  Lot of groupsay of What? HEY!... a few minutes later he disbands.<br>
<br>
I sent him numerous tells without a response.  Finally sent one that it was not worth the rep hit to ninja-loot a lousy 600pp item; finally got some responses.  He first claimed that he took it because it was FFA loot;  I replied that I had told him rolls on items.  After a couple more tells he then claimed he had rolled (which did not show on any group member's text) and had gotten a 99 thus it was his;  I said fine - but XXX had rolled a 100.  At this point his language was abusive and I put him on ignore and we all did a /report.<br>
<br>
Nice quick action by the Guide, however Munden still claimed FFA even though the entire group stated otherwise.  My /log was not accepted (they can be edited), but Guide did say he would pass the situation on to the Server GM.<br>
<br>
Lest any think this might be an honest mistake, I repeat:<br>
<br>
1.  As soon as he looted, he sat down and mem'd up his Port to EC, ported, without any comment in groupsay<br>
<br>
2.  Once in EC he disbanded, still without one word to the group or replies to my (and other's I believe) tells<br>
<br>
At least the sad day ended on somewhat of an up note - we had another loop drop, and we decided to give it automatically to the player that was robbed.  However, that still left the rest out of a loop chance.<br>

yes the name sounds familiar, was grouped with him at sarnaks.  he claimed himself somewhat of a ninja looter, i thought it was a joke.  he did however loot like it was "free for him", not ffa.  i didn't find much problem with him back then, since the rest of the group didn't loot so i could keep up, but then again sarnaks don't drop anything<br>

Several weeks ago,I was with lower-level friends in Oasis. A character named Chansey (sic) called for aid near the docks as someone had trained spawns near her(dry bones, ghouls, whatever....) There were quite a few, but green to me and . I whacked away at them and saw this Munden taking awhile to kill one (he was about 15 at the time). As there were injured and medding characters at the dock, I finished off the one he was fighting, lest it get away and agro at the dock. <br>
When I am done, I bow to him and I receive a rude gesture in return. I ask him in tell what his problem was, and he says that the last mob was &quot;his&quot;. (This mob was part of a small train, I didn't know they were assigned dance cards....)When i told him he was fighting a higher level mob in a bad place, he continued on that it was &quot;his&quot;. Thinking now I may have slighted him in some fashion, I told him that it was fine that he was helping Chansey, but the situation needed expediting because of the proximity. He then replies (verbatim): &quot;I don't care about helping&quot;. I asked him what did he mean, and he repilies &quot;I don't care about helping, I just wanted the experience&quot;. When i tell him another character was in trouble, he said again that he didn't care, and THEN says that I shouldn't be killing those mobs because I was too high-level!<br>
I understood at that time that I was dealing with a single-digit IQ at that point, and proceeded to chastise him for his selfishness, and told him that the game didn't need idiot children behaving like this. I then put him on ignore, and then he had the brass balls to ask my friends why I wouldn't speak to him!<br>
I don't blame him for this asshole-iness, I blame Verant/Sony. Why? Because they have created an environment for moron 13 year olds to thrive in with little or no thought as to consequence! Read my post &quot;Fiddly, Jackes,etc.&quot;. Nothing to my knowledge has been done to those mentioned. The GM/Admin who was supposed to &quot;handle&quot; that situation has done nothing! A flatliner like Munden is allowed to continue doing things like stealing and behave like an idiot because Sony/Verant only intervenes slowly and grudgingly. Do you think it's the first time he's stolen from groups? I guarantee that he's done it before and gotten away because of half-assed followups from GMs/Guides. These are the things that will drive older gamers away from EQ eventually, leaving it a Hell of KSing, &quot;Doodspeak&quot; and bad manners (the game is now unplayable on afternoons and early evenings, and it seems to be getting worse, not better.....<br>

<br>
I was the one who rightfully won this Forest Loop on Saturday morning.  I rolled the 100 (my first ever) as Munden sat there memming his spell.  When I asked him in tell after he ported why he looted and ran, he pretended not to know what I was talking about or even know who I was.<br>
<br>
I petitioned/reported (as well as Caeric), and the guide (I apologize for not having any names for this post, I didn't plan on posting about this till later so I didn't bring my notes to work, but it looks like it's begun without me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) after listening to both sides told me he could not make Munden give it back and that Munden had told the guide that he had thought all loot was FFA (and as Caeric said, that he will turn it over to a GM - EDIT: the logs, not the loop).  He never offered to come back and roll on the loop, or apologize, or demonstrate any kind of regret for the mix-up.  After a few minutes of chatting with the guide, he logged out.  <br>
<br>
I also have tried to bring this to the attention of his guild, but have had little luck finding an officer in game or a web page.  I name the guild ONLY so that someone in a posistion to help resolve this may see this post.  I know and have grouped with several people in this guild and they have all been great players with the exception of this one.  <br>
<br>
That being said, Munden is in Silent Defenders.  <br>
<br>
If someone in that guild who sees this could bring this up with your officers, I'd greatly appreciate it.<br>
<br>
I know this character is still in the FM area, as I saw him there Sunday morning, so beware.  He quickly logged when I got there from LOIO, so I had no chance to confront him.<br>
<br>
I can be reached in game during the week usually later PST by the name of Syriinx (bard of awesome power).<br>

<br>
Keep the names of all in group, and talk to Frizz about it. Also, it's best if possible if you can do a /report right after it happens, that way at least they'll have *some* record of the chat logs. (Sucky part is you can only do one /report per zone, so you'll lose out if they say more after you report.)<br>
<br>
That can also be used to help verify real logs (yes yes they can be edited, etc. but some GMs will look at them anyway. They just won't based a decision *solely* on a log.)<br>
<br>
With anything major, you need to talk to the GM, guides have extremely limited powers. <br>
<br>
Hopefully the druid will have action taken on their account for it.<br>
<br>
(Side note: Considering how cheap forest loops sell for, and how *easy* it is for druids to farm plat it's amazing how cheap some people will sell out their rep. Better to find out on an item like this I suppose then some major raid loot).<br>

<br>
Munden was a new MG member and had not been in the guild long, and when he did he had hinted of begging...I warned him of it, but it continued.  One day I log in and hes telling me in Guild chat that unless I can give him a reason to stay, he was leaving to be an officer in another guild.  Then hints he wants a bribe to stay, I quickly Remove him from the Guild and tell him Good luck be safe but you are not welcome here. That he could go join that other guild. <br>
<br>
I spen the next three weeks being harrassed by this dude, even had a Guide warn him.  Its been over a month, and hes finally left me alone, (i ignored him /shrug)  save for today when I suddenly getting a tell and he apologized for his past actions.<br>

He then began casting a spell &amp; next thing I know I'm at the druid ring in NK(it was camped so there were no druids thank god), at this point I knew he was up to something because he said he memed the wrong spell.  So he ported again &amp; we ended up at the druid ring in WC, &amp; me being an iksar that meant instant death.  When I got back to my bind point he had already logged off so I'm sure it was his intention to kill me, since I was bound in FP instead of FoB it wasn't too hard to get my corpse, but since he had originally ported me to NK I believe that he had intended to make it impossible to get my corpse (Guards on the NK\SK bridge &amp; Highpass, well forget about it) So don't ever get in a group with this guy no matter what the reason!<br>
