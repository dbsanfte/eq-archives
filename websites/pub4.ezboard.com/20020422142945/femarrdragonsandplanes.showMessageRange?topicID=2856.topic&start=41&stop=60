<br>
if she did indeed just flat out give him the item, then she has no right to ask for it back. if it was in fact a loaner, then he should give it back. after that long of a time though, espically with her leaving the game, i prolly would have thought it mine as well. if the girlfriends twink isn't using this item then give it back, if she is, then at least give something of equal value, or something to repair the friendship. my RL friends wouldn't even loan me a cloak like that, thats quite a friendship to lose.<br>

And wouldn't it be a damn sight easier to ask your woman for the cloak back than someone else?  <br>
<br>
.    Nah, this cloak won't be given back, it never would have been.  And yes, I think it was a loaner.  Ted said he didn't like how she came back in game and only asked about the cloak, in actuality he doesn't like the thought of being in the doghouse with no lovin's.  Ted said it himself, he still had the cloak on his person when she first asked for it back.  He said in his post that he told her he was still using it, he did not tell her that 'hey, you gave me this'.  <br>
<br>
.   He then goes on to say that he looked for her the day he got his fallin stars cloak.  Why did he look for her?  Because he knew it was a loaner and was going to give it back, then BAM!!  A new thought come's to mind.  &quot;I'll twink my woman with it!!&quot;  Holy tender sweet cuddlin lovin's batman!  Nope, the true owner of the cloak wasn't online at that moment when the fallin stars cloak dropped, so they lost out to twinkin the significant other.  <br>

<br>
Now, one side (Tarla) says I called it a loan and one side (Ted) says it's a gift.  I doubt that either of the 2 sides are ever going to change their view point on this.<br>
<br>
So, what to do from here?  I'd say that Tarla is being honest about thinking it was a loaner, and that the right thing for Ted to do would be to return the cloak because this has all been a big freakin mess.  Ted, you know who has it, and I'm sure your girlfriend would be understanding about such a dilemma.  Tarla gave you the item in good faith of you one day returning it, even if you don't percieve it as such.<br>
<br>
Plus, there's the one conversation in which Ted seems to know Tarla wants the cloak back, but says he wants the cloak of falling stars before he returns it.  That one's kinda got me wondering.<br>

Had ya actualy talked back to me, and agnolged me, I prob never would of had the guts to ask for it back. Given you something till you get better didn't mean to me that ya hold out for 1 far far better either, that pissed me off, like loaning a someone a camaro and telling them can use it till they get better and then when ya ask them if they got better yet, cause ya need your camaro back now, it's been 6+ months and they tell ya, well I'm holding out for rolls royce, screw the corvette I could of had. Your girlfriend is the only that did say hello to me, actualy she said hello to me often without me haveing to say it first. If you acted like her I would of felt you were still infact a friend, not someone that used me to get the cloak. You can say you never say hello to anyone, but you sure as hell said hello to me when ya loged on before I gave you the cloak, why the change after?? I'm more pissed about feeling used and bent over by someone I felt was a friend, then I ever will about looseing a item, no matter how much it ment to me or how much I liked it. Plain and simple I thought you were a true friend so gave it to you &quot;untill you got better&quot; to find that you didn't give a shit about me, just the item I had. Wish I had time to read all the posts, but I'm being asked to get off line, I'll try to get back to them later when I can. Take care all. Oh, on a side note I de lvl'd my warrior low enough to do Naggy, 2 cloaks droped today and I lost both rolls :/. If I ever do get one, it will be up for trade for a SBC.<br>

Yeah, there is a difference, but in the end, just do the right thing and help out someone who once helped you.<br>
<br>
You're right though, Ted, in that in technicality you're probably not wrong for refusing to give it back, assuming it wasn't loaned to you, but indeed given to you unconditionally as you claim.  Don't confuse that for doing the right thing though.  It's kind of a societal parallel here...just because something isn't illegal, doesn't make it right.<br>

<br>
it all took place last spring....<br>
<br>
tarla has like 5 billion characters, at the time he was playing a 54/55 warrior, 54/55 enchanter, 54/55 cleric, and a 40 monk.<br>
<br>
one day tarla tells me that he's quitting his warrior and monk for good.  then he tells me that he's giving ted his SBC since he won't need it.  yes i was quite surprised by this as well.  he tells me not to tell ted cus he wants to surprise him.<br>
<br>
he gave ted the cloak, ted was super happy.<br>
<br>
lummox breaks up after many many people disappear from the game, including tarla and his gf at the time kemidra.<br>
<br>
ted and i join UI.<br>
<br>
many months go by, i don't see tarla.<br>
<br>
one day, i see tarra.  OMG tarra where have you been?!?  blah blah blah.  do u still play?  what happened to you?  how's kemi?  blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
i don't see tarra again for quite some time.<br>
<br>
now i start seeing tarla again.  tarla tells me that he's going to play his monk again.<br>
<br>
tarla levels up his monk.<br>
<br>
tarla begins harassing ted for the cloak that he GAVE ted.<br>
<br>
i continue to chat with tarla briefly in tells, tarla never mentions to ME anything about the cloak.<br>
<br>
ted gets a new cloak on a guild raid.  ted gives me his SBC as a birthday gift (RL).<br>
<br>
it's 9 months later and tarla is asking for a cloak that he GAVE to ted.  true, he has been harassing ted for this cloak for the past month or so, but that's not the point.  the point is that he GAVE the cloak to ted and ted no longer has the cloak.  tarla, you and i used to be friends and though we don't talk much these days since your long absence, i don't understand why you never mentioned this problem to me before knowing that ted and i share everything with each other.  it seemed kind of fishy to me, but i figured it was cus u knew that i knew the truth of the situation.  i can understand how you'd want the cloak back, it's a nice item, but it's no longer in ted's possession and he has no reason to return it to you simply because you changed your mind ONCE again.  that's not a cheap shot btw, it's the truth.  i'm sorry that this happened, but i really would appreciate if you wouldn't flame ted for this.  if you want to hold a grudge against someone, hold it against me.  ted has never wronged someone in this game, it's not his style.  he's a completely sweet guy and would never ever scam someone or lie or steal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umoltaenyadmagmus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moltaenya D Magmus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/3/02 5:21:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2856.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sad tail of giving a friend a item &quot;Till he gets be</span><hr size=1> So your the GF who supposedly has the cloak now?<br>

Is it such a big deal? , or was it because Tarla didnt kiss ass properly when she/he did come back before asking for the stupid cloak?. And its all down to who said what. And who really cares if they have said amount of twinks and Ted doesnt. If its on one of your chars Meg, just give the cloak back. Gift/Loaner we will never know will we, even with Meg's post, she has the cloak on one of her twinks, why would she want to give it back?. Considering some of the back tracking on what Ted said and some of the things Tarla said, its a loaner and things loaned are not suppose to be given to someone else as a gift. Not even if that person has been gone for a while.  Your friends say your a nice and fair person. Give the damn cloak back, and get something else for your GFs twink. <p><center><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/dfitzpatrick/Anasig5.jpg"></a></center>

<br>
and i don't feel it mattered wether i was using it or not, he gave it to me with the intention of leaving the game permantly. if we were still in good standing and he came back, and needed it, i would give it back, but me and this person aren't in good standings anymore, and he can lick the dog shit off my shoe for all i care.<br>

Lateris gave me at least 5 robes and impskin gloves, when I offered those back, he said "I gave you those because your a friend, if you weren't I would still have them."<br>
<br>
Point being, even tho I was given something, I still thank the person who gave it.  If Lat were to ask me tomorrow for a pair of impskin gloves, I would be in SolA camping them for him.<br>
<br>
Ted, I dunno you nor do I know this other person.  Were I in your shoes tho, I would get something similar if no tthe same item for them.  If at that point you no longer wish to see them /ignore but until the business is finished one way or the other, watch your own ass bro. =)<br>

Gimme a break. I used to gift/loan stuff out all the time, and I see at least two names here of people to whom I've lent stuff. Resist gear, mana gear, weapons for twinks, whatever. Give it back when you see me sort of thing, I don't feel like grabbing a port to the Iceyclad Forest of the Second Moon of Emerald Trakteeth just so I can pick up my fireproof pants, etc.<br>
<br>
I haven't played in months. I don't seriously expect these people to have my shit lying around waiting for me. Hell, I don't even expect they'd still be playing. <br>
<br>
Now, if it were a couple weeks, I could understand being upset. But months is a very long time in EQ. If you plan on leaving on an extended vacation, collect your gear back together and stow it in the bank. <br>
<br>
If it's YOUR stuff, it's YOUR responsibility. If you want something back, get it back. Don't up and vanish for half a year and then come back looking for it, and then flame someone because they gave it away or sold it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=261&stop=280>14</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=281&stop=300>15</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=301&stop=320>16</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=321&stop=340>17</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=341&stop=360>18</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=361&stop=380>19</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=381&stop=400>20</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2856.topic&start=401&stop=420>21</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=2856.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=2856.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2856.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2856.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2856.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2856.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2856.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying -
