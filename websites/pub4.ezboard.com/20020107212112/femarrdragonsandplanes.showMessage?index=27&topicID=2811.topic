Moralistic as that might be its true. <br>
If that was the case in the beginning you believed that Hitler was right? He had the might then, was he right? No of course not. <br>
Of course people are selfish at times and self centered, but that does not mean they are all the time Chiteng. When the world trade center went down you think all those people who stayed for days searching for people were concerned with themselves? I think not. <br>
If might makes right, do you think that President Bush would have held back in so many respects and let things go as they have? No, he let certain things take there course. Why? Because you cant trample all over everyone because you have the might to do it. There are repercussions to everything despite size and status of any country.  <br>
Some sayings have there place and time. War is not one of them for this one. And Helius does have a point, everyone in the world does not have the same view as the United States even of its closest neighbors. One peoples politics are not anothers. <br>
And dont fool yourself either that the *breeding * of other countries is not going to affect you or the troubles that go on in them dont affect you personally. It already does. Alot of the policies that the government uses to help , deflect or interject themselves in reflects in the taxes you pay and how you get paid from any job you might have, if not, then how much your next welfare or disability cheque will be. Or what have you. Whatever goes on in the world might not impact you in an intrusive manor, but it does affect you none the less. It affects the food you buy and where you buy it and the quality of it and how much its going to cost you. Just a few small examples of how the rest of the world intrudes on your own concerns. <p><center><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/dfitzpatrick/Anasig5.jpg"></a></center>

<br>
You confuse 'personal' morality with 'global' morality.<br>
I dislike the death penalty, 'because' it is NOT applied fairly by the people who<br>
apply it. However I would not oppose hiring someone to get rid of Bin Laden.<br>
<br>
Personal Murder vs Abstract Murder.<br>
<br>
I am fully aware of the impact of overpopulation upon the USA.<br>
<br>
Prez. Bush can say anything he wishes since he has the backing of the most powerfull country in the world to implement his will. It says little or nothing<br>
about his PERSONAL morality, and in this context his personal morality is not<br>
relevent (except perhaps to get him elected) What he says can easily become<br>
a self-fullfilling prophecy. Those dont impress me.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if we could interject morality into international politics but it doesnt work. <br>
<br>
As far as might makes right as a policy,<br>
Carthage was destroyed.<br>
Hitler was overcome by greater might.<br>
In 1938 Chamberlin WANTED to oppose Hitler at Munich but the British armed<br>
forces had met with him and confessed that they were TOTALLY unprepared<br>
for war and that he(Chamberlin) should make concessions to STALL. He did,<br>
it worked, we won. <br>
<br>
I oppose in principle extending ANY aid whatever to any population that<br>
refuses to control its birthrate. Such efforts merely get us resented by the<br>
people we help. The Sudan comes to mind.<br>
<br>
I do NOT suggest we withdraw to isolation, not at all. I suggest that we make sure that we stay on top. <br>
<br>
You cannot reason with a fanatic Anaiel, you can only kill them. I think we should be ready to become good at that. Very good indeed.<br>
<br>
Allow me to give you an example:<br>
<br>
Lets say India(they have nukes) demands that we deliver 500 million bushels<br>
of grain to India to feed their people. Do you think that would go over well?<br>
Yet India could NOT be ignored since they have nukes.<br>
Plus the additude that the USA has food it throws away. <br>
<br>
BTW I am NOT talking about 'purchasing' the grain...I am talking about extortion.<br>
To the Indians I would suggest that they are NOT afraid of the USA Nukes because<br>
they are starving anyway. From that outlook you have just created 800million<br>
fanatics.<br>
<br>
A grim scenario to be sure. But only one.<br>
<br>
I suggest to you that unless we ARE willing to lower GREATLY the American<br>
standard of living, we will face more and more such issues. The USA consumes<br>
85% of the world resources. That is resented. Dr. Malthus was correct.<br>
We cannot win without raising the death rate. Its just a matter of HOW it is raised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Allow me a diffrent scenario:<br>
<br>
Lets say 'I' hated the USA. Lets say I had access to Anthrax.<br>
There are 7 Major foodlots in the USA for Beef distribution. It would be<br>
very easy to drive to Kansas City for example and take a guided tour<br>
of the foodlot. In 48 hours the spores would be distributed all across the country.<br>
<br>
All it takes Anaiel is imagination and WILL. You better hope the uSA gains some will<br>
FAST.<br>
<br>
Did you know that if you burn Carbontetrachloride in an oxygen rich atmoshere<br>
it becomes phosgene? Did you know that you can extract nerve gas from<br>
insecticide? Anyone who has taken Analytical Chemisty could give it a shot.<br>
<br>
The age of innocence is over.<br>

There is a happy medium, which I personally don't think we have yet to find. I know we were not completely out of WW2 when our allies were being smacked around. We helped make ships, planes, supplies basically. We did the same thing in WW1 until we became directly involved.<br>
<br>
I fancy myself a passive person, if someone punches my friend in the middle of the street, I will punch back. We are not talking about single conflicts between single people. I realize this was only meant to simplify an opinion,   but I don't believe we can simplify it that much. The person punches my friend, I punch back, he breaks my arm and runs away. Do you see what happens here? I saw what you meant, but I can't say that I would support it in a country vs country enviroment, rather then person vs person. You send the countries after each other, and millions of people die. You scar your people.<br>
<br>
If we completely isolate ourselves, we will in fact drop behind in the economical world (although look at Europe, the Euro, big plans for their economy. Imagine eventually Europe acting and engaging as one country? Hello new super power)<br>
<br>
Someone (forgot, not pressing back button) mentioned oil. Yes, great stuff, right? When it's gone, are we going to just level the Mid east? We don't like them anyway, they won't have anything we need anymore. They clearly have an international monopoly here. New forms of fuel must be introduced. *cough* hydrogen. What happens when we light hydrogen when oxygen is around? Ahh, we get water, no more of air pollutants. I believe BMW is working on some sort of hydrogen powered car. We have an economical interest in the mid east, I'll agree with that. I won't agree that we should be there. They can fight, we don't NEED oil anymore. When it's all gone, what will we do? Why bother using this resource? It is a pollutant, the countries that control most of it, are not too fond of us. (I don't believe Israel controls too much oil)<br>
<br>

<br>
There will never be 'solitary' or 'personal' fusion reactors.<br>
The reason is that if you actually had one,<br>
you would in theory have EMMENSE personal power in your hands.<br>
Even if you put it in a car.<br>
The GOVERNMENT in ALL incarnations would NOT like each individual<br>
having the equivelent of (worse case) a nuke, (best case) something<br>
that leaks tritium. Tritium is radioactive. Let alone personal airframes.<br>
<br>
I think this is sad, and spells the end of the Democratic experiment.<br>
If a simple suicidal person and destroy a city that means that we will<br>
give the goverment the power to stop it. Just like automatic weapons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2858.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=352.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2811.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2811.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2811.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2811.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
