Your atheist also right?  We are still animals and Bound by nature.  We will reproduce like animals and die liek them too.  If you and other guy there are really athiests like you say;  then why would you even feel the need to respond to the &quot;Do you believe in God&quot; post????( A real athiest wouldn't respond to somehting that doesn't matter)   Its because you aren't atheist.  In fact, I think it is Extremely rare that anyone be an atheist(i mean like 1 in a million).  Atheist to me is somoene with some serious issues(not that people who say they believe in God don't have issues either)  Atheism is a response to a complicated situation(one might say the same for believing in God as well)  It's a developed thought pattern which protects, defends and/or shelters one against feelings of confusion,frustration, hopelessness and helplessness(again, one might say the same for believing in God as well).  It's difficult for me to be objective because of my strong faith in God. but if anything I would say I rather believe in something than nothing.  Soemthing matters; whatever it may be, but nothing doesn't matter.  'Nothing' is actually something, but it is something that has no real function or consequence, hence the idea of that other guys mom dying and it meaning nothing.  Or also when I called his mother a slut whore cocksucking bitch and compared her to a dog and in turn exclaimed &quot;that it didn't matter cause there is no God anyway&quot;.  BUT, that guy DID respond to my calling his mother those slanderous things; WHICH PROVES that he is NOT and atheist either. &lt;-----BECAUSE, a true atheist would not even respond to such garbage.(garbage meaning irrelevence)             Question for you Triff:  If you had all the answers, would you feel interested or curious anymore??  No I dont' think so &lt;--------REASON and logic which supports FAITH based belief.  FAITH being a union of heart and mind or Thought and Feeling. &lt;-------The same thing that makes the workd go 'round;  Order and Chaos.(chaos not in a bad sense, but being synonomous with change)  You, Triff are fooled by todays 'scientific-based thought'  its ok because most people are.  But science based thought is no better than any other fundamental which has been used in the evolution of humanity.  Just like Crawling when you are a baby might seem like it is inferior to walking but actually it is Crucial is the developement in a childs motor planning, which is used for mental growth as well.  Science does NOT contain all the answers nor will it ever.  God is not 'something' you can put in a box or sum up in a few words or feelings.  Thats what makes life beautiful.  Stop loooking for science and other logic based ideas to shape the world you live in.  Feel a little.  You know, 'feel', the Other half of who you are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utriff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Triff</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triffdot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 505<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 5:42:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=313>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Actually I do have one more thing to interject</span><hr size=1> Umm.. simply put, I don't define meaning by &quot;God's Will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reason and logic do not support faith (and you failed to even support that statement, you used some circular logic there). Faith is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a union of thought and emotion: it is the subordination of thought to your emotions. Faith in no way supports thought. The very definition of faith is belief <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> without logical proof</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. It shouldn't need to be said, but it requires no thought to not think.<br>
<br>
Science is the study of reality. Scientific thought is proving things to yourself before believing them. &quot;God&quot; certainly is not something you can define, and no, I don't think life is made beautiful by your belief in some entity that can't be defined.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Stop loooking for science and other logic based ideas to shape the world you live in.

Humans see, think, and begin to recognize values. Emotions are then based on those values. There is no separation.

<br>
Just so you know (and yes I do believe in God and I do read the bible so flame me for it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  neither the bible, not God, ever say you should just feel and follow your emotions.  You defined fatih as belief without logical proof... and later (in response to Brut222) implied that only those who do not think for themselves would have faith.  Is that correct?  <br>
<br>
I have been taught something entirely different about faith.  Faith in God doesn't mean you rely on your emotions and withdrawl your brain from use.  I shall give you a definition here: taken from the Parson's Bible Dictionary<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Faith is in general the persuasion of the mind that a certain statement is true (Phil. 1:27; 2 Thess. 2:13). Its primary idea is trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. It admits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance with the evidence on which it rests.<br>
Faith is the result of teaching (Rom. 10:14-17). Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith (John 10:38; 1 John 2:3)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As you can see, what I have been taught regarding faith is quite different from what you stated above.  Basically, I believe faith = trust.  <br>
<br>
I trust God and believe His word to be true.  I believe Jesus died for my sins = I trust in Him that He has redeemed me.  That's my belief and I operate from that standpoint.  Many people I know did not arrive at the decision to believe in God based upon simple emotions.  Instead, as in all things in their lives, they came to the decision after careful consideration and research.  I mean come on, there are some hard questions that we all have... like Why does God allow evil to exist?  If He is all powerful, why doesn't he just eradicate it?  Why did he allow it in the first place?  Anyone who blindly follows and never questions would not be human.  I jsut believe that the answers provided to me are true.  I trust them, I trust God.  I have faith.  But I do assure you, my brain did not turn off simply because someone said &quot;This is So!&quot;  I think about it, and come to my own conclusions.  <br>
<br>
Think of it this way...  suppose you met a person who acted completely mad on teh street, accompanied by your Mother (whom you trust).  Lets say she says this person is jsut pretending to behave this way for an experiment.  You have faith that your mother is telling you the truth and therefore, even though this person's actions are really weird, you decide to trust her and accompany her.  After a couple hours you all go home and you see this person indeed, take off theri odd actions and become &quot;normal.&quot;  You trusted your Mother, you had faith, but you still questioned, yes?  Did your brain stop working?  No.  You might have even reconsidered following your Mom and this weirdo around all day, but you believed your Mother to be right, and so trusted her.<br>
<br>
What I have been taught is somewhat the same.  So, this may offer you a different viewpoint to consider.  Although I believe in God, I am not representative of all people who believe, so they probably have differning attitudes (see Brut222) regarding this post, but hey, I was reading all this and thought I'd throw a bit more into the mix.<br>
<br>
Btw, if my first paragraph regarding your faith statement wasn't true, then I jsut typed all this for nothing didn't I?  Darnit!!!!<br>

Your dictionary has a nice reversal of the law of cause and effect there. Regardless of whether a thing is true or not, a fact that changes your entire way of life is not worthy of trust until you can prove it (but I guess your way of life is up to you). Faith isn't the result of teaching - it's believing.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith (John 10:38; 1 John 2:3).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Knowledge has absolutely nothing to do with the actual act of having faith. Faith is where you abdicate knowledge (or need of it).<br>
<br>
Here is the Merriam Webster definition I am using. You can check it <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.m-w.com">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> if you like.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Faith:<br>

Religion is an entire overhaul of one's whole life.

As we all know (from our experiments with magnets) like charges repel one another.<br>
<br>
Within each of us (within our very cells) is a mini miracle. The fact that the cell nucleus stays together has mystified scientists for years- it can not be scientifically explained. It is classified as an anomoly and is simply dismissed by the evolutionsits.<br>
<br>
Jesus once said: &quot;Through me all things were made; without me nothing was made that has been made. In me was life, and that life was the light of men...Through me all things were created, and by me all things shall be held together.&quot; (john 1:14 I believe..)<br>

The very miracle that is life, is proof positive that a higher power is at work in the universe.<br>
<br>
Evolution becomes somewhat irrelevant when the very existance of people and apes becomes impossible without this little miracle. <br>

Oh and yes actually it does mean that there is a God- science can't explain why the nucleus doesn't fly apart, and long before anyone knew what a cell or a proton was Jesus had claimed the credit for it. So yes actually this is proof.<br>

Just because I believe doesn't mean I never doubt, it doesn't mean I don't question.  <br>
<br>
I'm not here to convince you that your style of life is wrong or that what you believe is wrong as compared to me.  However, simply because someone has faith in God doesn't mean that they required no proof.  Really, there is no way to either prove nor disprove scientifically the existence of God.  God exists outside science.  In the end, you end up deciding based upon the evidence you can evaluate.  <br>
<br>
Well, with all the evidence I have seen, I chose to believe.  It takes an extra step either way.  To believe or to reject.. its a decision.  Btw, accepting Christ doesn't mean overhauling your life, though there should certainly be changes as you grow with God.  God accepts you just as you are.  <br>
<br>
Oh and I checked my Websters (Websters New World Dictionary, 2nd College Edition, printed 1986, page 503) :<br>
faith: 1) unquestioning belief that doesn't require proof or evidence.<br>
<br>
This definition says faith doesn't require proof or evidence, not that none exists.  Of course it also says unquestioning, and I bet that a lot of people who believe in God have doubts at times.  Including me for awhile. <br>
<br>
/shrug.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this was all to offer you another viewpoint, but I think you missed it.  It was from a bible dictionary, citing bible verses.  My point was that the bible doesn't teach blind faith based on emotions.  <br>

Your values are formed either by what you have thought out yourself, or—if you have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> done that—based on whatever your subconscious has deemed is good or bad as you go through life (this would be closer to &quot;your feelings&quot; actually). This being so, what you (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> truly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) think/believe will govern what you feel, and so I consider thought more important.<br>
<br>
Love is a strong happy feeling you get towards someone or something that follows your values (i.e. you value him/her/it a lot). It is not causeless, not a feeling that just magically appears out of nowhere. Trying to know and understand the truth is the only way you can logically form your own values.<br>
<br>
I don't consider love as such to be a virtue, but I do consider the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ability</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to truly love as one. And I think that to truly/fully love something, you must first understand your values and work out all contradictions there may be in your thinking. I think that Reason is the most important tool of any human being.<br>

<br>
First: I think you are taking that quote and twisting its meaning to be a reference to nuclei (you think he was talking to people about atoms in the 1st century?). There is no evidence to support that—it's pretty similar to the people telling you to type in NYC in wingdings and heralding it as a link to terrorism.<br>
<br>
Second: Even supposing he did mean that, where is your proof that there was no one who had understood atomic science back then? There are any number of possibilities (from hidden civilizations to alien intervention) to lead to that; but even if none of those happened and somehow he still said it with that meaning in mind—it is not proof.<br>
<br>
Third: Where is your proof that there was a divine Jesus who ever said anything like that in the first place? All you have to cite for evidence is your Bible and some historical evidence that some man named Jesus probably did exist sometime around Year 0, around that relevent location.<br>

My turn for a question now. If the three of you have found your own different reasons to believe in your god, why is it the Christian god in particular?

Ok your question was &quot;why is it that I choose christianity&quot;.  Several reasons.  1. I was born into a predominately Christian society.  As I got older I grew spiritually(not sure why, but I have taken a test which determines what type of learner you are and I tested as one who learns based on values.  Extra info-there are 4 different basic types of learners &lt;---fact    so I'm sure that involves, what I think, is a strong understanding of ethics/morals/psychology/sociology/human science type shit if you will)  so number 2. My learning style probably makes it easier for me to quickly understand this kind of shit.(just like your learning style probably allows you to more quickly understand the hard sciences) (about my learning style; There is a secondary strength which helps make for a good combo but I don't want to get into that too much)unless you want to.<br>
3.  Ok, back to when I when I grew up.  To put it very simple, I developed the same moral and ethical base as the new testament(Jesus).  I didn't realize it and even question the existence of Jesus until I was around 20 years of age.  Then some of the things that pissed me off about Christianity I found was false (I was taking a New testament class).  I had a very strong feeling form that point on that Jesus kicks ass and I love him for how he loves me.  So, in short, I developed the same Christian values with not going to church or having any peps in my family that influenced my idea of God.  There is much more to it but in short that is why.  And Triff, if you want answers from God all you have to do(and this is always true except when it is not necasarry to know, unless you keep insisting on knowing)  Ask God for the knowledge.  No matter what it is Triff.  Knowledge( I'm trying to think or imagine an example for this but I can not find a scenario where by you won't get an answer except for somehting like&quot;God tell me how it feels to be your ass&quot;  this is not necassary and will not be answered UNLESS you develop a strong feeling for this THEN you will know somehow someway.  I personally have asked many many questions and don't always do it 'cause I have noticed how powerful knowledge is, and how I can't handle it(knowledge meaning to feel some experience without going through the crap that gets you there).  This kind of stuff I have only explained to a couple very close people in my life.  This gets much more complicated.  DON'T take this to 100% literally 'cause I am not the perfect speaker or writer.  Tell me Triff, what would you like to know of God?  Plz tell me.  I will not attempt to answer your question but I am sure you will get the answer.  I am confident in this.  I don't normally express my 'very personal' relationship with God.  Plz respect that for me.  <br>
Flame the hell out of numbers 1 and 2, but plz don't flame 3.  Ask whatever you want, just plz no flamage.  I am not claiming to be somehitng special or have some kind of Godly knowledge.  I am only saying that you can know, understand and feel the answers for yourself. God, please give me the knowledge to understand why, what etc............... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utriff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Triff</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.maclem.com/images/triff/triffdot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 509<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/30/01 5:26:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=323>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to the Last Three Posts</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I was born into a predominately Christian society.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Listing that as a reason is not very um.. devout, I guess, of you. *shrugs*<br>
<br>
When I was younger I prayed a lot and read the happy little bible stories and things, and nothing ever happened, beyond me as a kid praying for snow days (during winter, mind you) and sometimes getting them, lol. I started losing interest in it (and morality as a whole) after a while because it never made a whole lot of sense to me, but never actually questioning whether Christian values really are right. Then I met my current girlfriend, who had me read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. It took me three months to finish the book, and it changed the way I think, for the better. And then I read all of her other books, and am currently about to finish Atlas Shrugged for the second time. Ayn Rand, 50 years ago, thought through all the ethics and actions of societies, and was able to compile them into a unifying philosophy called Objectivism, a philosophy based on objective reality. And I found that I totally agree with what she wrote about people.<br>
<br>
Now, about asking things of a god. I've closed my eyes and asked &quot;Do you exist?&quot; on occasion. Nothing. That's all I'd really want to know from a god. I don't really have anything more to say about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/30/01 7:14:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=324>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to the Last Three Posts</span><hr size=1> Sounds like the question you have for God is, &quot;God, please give me the knowledge to know and/or understand if/how you exist&quot;  Ask God for yourself.

<br>
Brutas,  In the act of asking one has to assent to the idea they are talking to something real... to something that can hear the question. But, if Triff doesn't know there is a god (i.e., he has no reasonable justification to believe and there is in fact a god) then he can't sincerely ask god for knowledge. It would be like me, a non-believer in Santa Claus, popping a letter in the mail addressed to Santa in the North Pole. Why would I even consider it? I would have to have some reasonable justification for sitting down to write the letter from the start! Likewise, the act of asking god requires that I have justification to believe that my request will be heard. <b>In other words, in order to ask I must already believe.</b> <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Thats why I tried to express that everyone has their own way of communiaction whether that be listening or speaking(or writing).  I just expressed an idea.  Kinda like saying&quot; I know you have tried coffee before and it really didn't do anything for you but I really thiink you will like this Hazelnut flavor)  I AM NOT boasting a certain religion/idea   Like I said before and I'll say it again, It does NOT matter (in my opinion) if you 'believe in the existence of God.  We will all know when the time comes(for each person, whenever that may be)  Doesn't matter   doesn't matter  doesn't matter    believe what you want to.  I don't believe God loves me better than Triff or any other 'atheist'  or, like i said earleir,  even the worst person who ever lived.  Let me ask you guys a question;  think of the person you love,  now think to yourselves, what is more important, &quot;my recognition of the physicall existence of that person OR the realtionship I have with them??  I would never ask you if you believed in this friend of yours.  SOUNDS obvious to you but I bet some peps could scientifically PROVE that what you are seeing in that 'person' you love soo much is a delusion or a form of symbolic logic created by your brain.  THAT same person could tell you, &quot;hey man, you and everyone else are nothing but a big bag of chemicals.  Nothing in your life is real, not even the love you have for your mother, father, sidter, brother, friend, dog, cat or whatever&quot;  IT CAN BE PROVEN SCIENTIFICALLY.  <br>
<br>
     So anyway I was telling Triff (in a very round about way, of which I did not want to throw all this info at him at once-with regards to possibly thrashing the info/idea (what the hell ever) I gave/suggested to him.  IN A NUTSHELL.  Faith is a tool.  A compass.  ( AND TRIFF--when you ahve kids you will know/feel when they are about to get into shit, TRUST ME)  FAITH allows me to explore the realm of my spirituality in new areas.  IT is not the only reason I believe in God.  It IS(not sure for every person in the world but it is for me) necassary as a foundation for creating a relationship with God  (JUST LIKE it is for your friends/parents/siblings--very similar)  The answer to all this and most everyhting in the world is not so black and white, and easy to explain.  ANOTHER 'thing' that has improved my relationship with God is 'asking for the knowledge'.  I DON&quot;T know and don't claim to know if realtionship with God is same for all peps.  In fact I think it is prob very different. Kinda like how I prefer to speak to different peps differently.  (Peps have different lines of communication)  This 'asking for the knowledge stuff' is a real part of my relationhip wth God(Just as giving a hug or smiling or loving someone close to you was and is.  Same thing.  Its just a relationship.  Call it real or not.  If its not then I need to market this drug cause its some good shit.

You asked why I chose the Christian God.  Quite an involved question, but I'll do my best to be quick at the answer.<br>
<br>
Before I do - one thing.  Science does NOT = reality.  Science is knowledge gained by observation, experimentation, and study in order to determine the nature of what is being studied.  Reality is what is real - what is fact.  My reality is not yours.  I believe God exists.  You do not.  Both facts.   Who is right?  Regardless, God is supernatural.  Not natural.  How do you scientifically study the supernatural?  As best you can.  And I think many have done the best they can with the existence of God.  There is no absolute scientific evidence of either the existence or the non-existence of God.  Its all in what you choose to believe after examining the evidence.<br>
<br>
Now, onward to your question.<br>
<br>
I was raised Catholic - hated it, hated everything about it.  Thought of God as this being up there with a tally sheet marking down everytime I lied so that he could send me to hell.  Also, my Gram talked about the Devil **gasp** like he was real.  Freaked me out.  I mean yeah I wanted to believe in a God, but not a Devil who might want to hurt me.  Needless to say - turned away from the church quite early I did.<br>
<br>
Went to camp at 14, became a Christian there.  Why?  Because there was something missing in my life that no one could fill.  Not mom or dad, not other guys, not friends, not even myself.  I kept thinking to myself  &quot;this cannot be all there is.&quot;  I mean, whats the point of living I thought, if you just keel over in 50 years and get eaten by worms?  Also, I liked the fellowship there.  The acceptance.  The love.  I found myself wanting to be a part of that community.<br>
<br>
I was able to keep that for a couple years, then went to college, and lost the fellowship, which really, I lost my path too.  I had no fellowship, I didn't study the Bible.. my fiancee didn't believe in God even.<br>
<br>
Fast forward.  Serious personal issues arise in marraige.  Marraige almsot breaks down, I ask for a divorce.  My husband after 30 years of non-belief finds a chuch, becomes a Christain.  Took him almost two years, but I finally believed that he really had changed.  For him, it was because of his relationship with God.<br>
<br>
I started going to church again.  I renewed my realtionship with God, and now am &quot;walking&quot; with God as we call it, studying and developing.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say, God saved me years ago, God saved my marraige through my husband's prayer and patience and change, God has given me all that I cherish.<br>
<br>
That explains why God.  Its all experience and emotions, yeah.  My husband's decision was NOT on emotion, neither was a close friend's... theirs was based on research, which I helped with.  I also had questions.<br>
<br>
Now, why the Christian God out of all the religions/Gods currently out there?<br>
<br>
Jesus is the only one who offers forgiveness.  Thats the simple answer.<br>
<br>
I<br>
ll elaborate a teeny bit more now.<br>
<br>
I don't want to quote bible verses at you, but obviously, I believe in God, and in the fall, and in the need for forgiveness in order to be with God.  Without that forgiveness, I would be judged by God when I die.  I don't want to be judged, I know that I fall far short.  I'd be in Hell for sure!  Yeah, we all think the line where hell begins is always right below where we are, no matter what we are doing.  We don't think we need forgiveness.  But!  Jesus offers not only forgiveness, but bridges the gap between God and all humans that occurred with the fall.  God's nature is immutable.  He is love and patience, he is also just, judging, holy, and righteous.  I personally, do not want to be without God in this life or in eternity.  Jesus makes it so that I do not have to be.  His forgiveness clears me of all sin, always.  And let me tell you - what a damn relief that is!  <br>
<br>
No other God, no other religion offers this.<br>
<br>
Should I say that again?<br>
<br>
The Christian God is the only one that offers this free gift of forgiveness.  No hoops to jump through, no changes to make before doing it, no restictions. Just a decision and a small prayer, asking God to come into your heart.  Read rev 3 :20 (i think) Behold, I stand at the door and knock..    that one.  <br>
<br>
Judiasm and Islam are the other monotheistic religions.  Both believe Jesus was a prophet, neither believe he was the messiah, come to take away the sins of the world.  Judiasm is still waiting.  Neither offer a free gift of forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Most of the other major religions are pantheistic, polytheistic, or even animalistic.  Looking critically at all of the religions, Christianity (for me and for many) offers the best answers, the best solutions, and evidence I find compelling.  These other religions sometimes offered answers, but often they did not.  Not for sin, or evil, or suffering, or values, or love, or morals, or even existence itself.<br>
<br>
In addition, after asking God into my life and pursuing a relationship with Him, I have seen incredible changes.  Both in my life and in others.  <br>
<br>
There is so much more I could say, but I believe I answered your question.<br>
<br>
In summary, no other God, no other religion, offers freely a gift of forgiveness to all humankind that brings us into a relationship with God as it was meant to be.  <br>
<br>
I want the relationship, I want the forgiveness (that one time boon - Jesus has paid our Debt in Full for all time for us - for free, every sin I've ever committed or do commit or will commit).  <br>
<br>
It is the only religion that made sense to me.<br>
<br>
It says in the bible actually, that to the unbeliever, God's words will sound as foolishness.  It sounds too good to be true in many people's opinions, but it really is the truth.  I firmly believe that.  If you choose not to listen or believe, that is your absolute free choice.  I do believe it is an eternal choice though.<br>
<br>
Yeah, ok flame me for a God-loving bible thumper.  Proud to be so!<br>
<br>
Have a great day.<br>

<br>
Lukaria that is one of the lamest dumb ass statements of the century!! So, let me see. If I observe, study, and prove by experimentation that Buffy my lap dog sheds hairs I have squat! It is not reality that Buffy my lap dog shed hair? Lukaria you are a dumb shit!<br>
<br>
Now to brighten your day Lukaria! Science is truly the study of what is real and what is fact. You want to talk about "reality" then you better get a little more dryer behind your ears. I suggest you actually finish school Lukaria. It might even be good to drop EQ to read those books you might not be reading so you can game! Are you 15 Lukaria? Just asking. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Yes, you are correct to some extent. I apologize Lukaria. You are not deserving my flames. I can admit that I have a deep seated hatred of non-rational religious responses. When I read such responses I do go overboard.   <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

I'm thinking you must have a different definition that I do of 'faith'.  What IS your definition Triff??  In a nutshell, mine is trust.<br>

beyond saying that if you come up with an example where you'd say I'm having faith in another person, I will tell you, &quot;In that case I choose not to have faith, and instead judge the results by probability.&quot; <br>
