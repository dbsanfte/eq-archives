<br>
I'd suggest this was in part due to peer pressure plus the threat of having her name black listed across the entire server.<br>
<br>
Funnily enough one of her conditions for returning the FBSS was that I was called off...like I was a snarling dobermann or something. And I wasn't even in the Frenzy group!<br>
<br>
/em tries to not let the power go to his head.<br>
<br>
So alls well that ends well and I'm certain Alierina won't do this again. I think she made a bad tactical error and realises the error of her ways.<br>
<br>
And gratz Ath...I take full credit for you being in that Frenzy group as it was me sent you a tell..after your hypnotic *your tanks are getting sleepy* message ;)<br>

You were WEARING an FBSS.  There were a couple of people in the camp who DID NOT HAVE one, and had been there for weeks on end trying to get one to USE (one tank in particular, but his name escapes me at the moment).  When one dropped, you insisted on rolling for it.  It's lore.  You had one on you.  You greedy fuck.  Another groupmember had an FBSS rolled for it expressly for the purpose of beating your roll to GIVE IT TO THE PERSON WHO NEEDED IT.  A guide was called in, and somehow your friend (some non-group necro that you'd called to come hold your new FBSS) was given possession of the FBSS.  At that point, you logged off.  Other people spoke to the guide, who admitted that the decision was most likely not the best one.  He had made the decision too quickly, without thinking about the reason for LORE tags (item hording such as this).  Unfortunately, renegging on a ruling tends to be even worse than a bad judgment call.<br>
<br>
You have no right to speak down on someone for keeping an FBSS the person shouldn't have, as you yourself took one that you shouldn't have taken.  The entire zone heard about what went on that night, which is probably why you promptly camped out.  Now you're back to trying to get more sashes?<br>

He was in L guk and I told him I had won one. He came and got his, and I looted mine. So in all truth, I never had 2 FBSS's. Before you make comments on people get the entire story, dickhole.

This is Sihl.  Same computer, different person.<br>
<br>
Rhamel and Thurk, I don't post as Sihl because I don't feel like making a new ezboard account.<br>
For anyone who cares, I'm a newbie rogue on Erollisi Marr.  3 guesses what I was doing in Lower Guk?<br>
<br>
Anyway, down to the point.  Thurk, I don't believe a word you said.  Everyone these days has an excuse when being accused of something.  Yours just doesn't hold water.  First off, my roommate was in the frenzied group just minutes earlier.  She was leading, and invited you into the group even AFTER being told by groupmembers that they weren't comfortable with you joining because of your personality (read: rude and selfish).  Why did she invite you?  She was sticking to the list given to her by the previous leader of the group.  I logged on after she logged off (one EQ-ready PC in the house).<br>
<br>
Because of this, I know you had been in that group for some time that night.  Call me crazy, but that's some damn coincidence that your brother got in an accident just at the moment that you were picking up your FBSS and were catching flak from the rest of the zone.<br>
<br>
You &quot;explained what had happened to him.&quot;  Why word it that way?  If it was fair, then nothing happened to him at all.  If he was just scammed, then something had indeed happened to him.<br>
<br>
I also like how you decided to come back and ADD that oh yeah, your brother was in an accident.  You spent a week in the hospital with him?  I sure don't believe that, seeing as I saw you online in EQ constantly in the few days after.  If you're going to lie, make sure it's at least believable.<br>
<br>
You scammers always have an excuse.  Um, I'm roleplaying.  Uh, the GMs said it was OK to killsteal if I only do it to named spawns.  Er, my brother was playing my character.<br>
<br>

There ya go twist it around to sound like something, yer good. I meant he explained what had happened to him. He was pissed cause he lost the FBSS a number of times. Ask him if you dont believe me.<br>

Why believe me?  Think back to the members of that group.  You had refused to let one of them into the group before, and another just didn't like you.  I don't remember their names, but maybe you will.  The two in particular were a cleric and a paladin.  There was a standing list though, and you were bugging people to hurry up and let you in.<br>

Of course he told you a different story.  He'd had more time to think <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> after</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you abruptly camped, and in retrospect had decided that his ruling wasn't the best for the situation.  I don't care that you used to be a guide.  A lot of people are or were guides at one point.  I also didn't say that the decisions are final.  They are, however, authoritative rulings.  Going back on them often causes problems and a lack of confidence in GM authority, as has been stated multiple times by Verant PR.  Yes, they override rulings.  Do they do it often?  Hell no.  They avoid it at every possible chance.<br>
<br>
...and no, I think you gave a much better example of &quot;talking out yer ass&quot; when you threw in that claim of a broken arm emergency, just as you got the FBSS.<br>

It's called reading the chat window.  Oh, and I'm willing to bet you would've thrown a fit if you hadn't been let into the group.  You knew you were first on the list, and were walking back and forth in front of everyone so you'd be invited.  Those in the group who had a problem with you said they wouldn't object if you were invited, so it wasn't like she'd insisted on anything.  The list was given, so the list was used.<br>

Damn, I should've taken screenshots.  Who knows, maybe you got tired of waiting for a groupmember to answer the campchecks.  Whatever the case, in the next couple of days I was in Lower Guk, I saw your name calling out &quot;frenzy.&quot;<br>

What does this have to do with me supposidly not inviting someone? Anyhow, I dont know if you have grouped in the frenzy latley (or ever) but im going to let you in on a little something. They do not keep a list (majority dont anyway). You leave that room. They dont go looking for you. Again, you know so much for someone who wasnt there. <br>

It wasn't about you not inviting someone.  It was about you insinuating that the person who invited you into the group was doing something that the group didn't agree to - making a call without the group's consent.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Anyhow, I dont know if you have grouped in the frenzy latley (or ever) but im going to let you in on a little something. They do not keep a list (majority dont anyway). You leave that room. They dont go looking for you. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You're really doing a great job of making me laugh right now.  With someone in your household who has a 50+ character, you learn about things just by talking and watching as the person plays.  Don't lie about there being no lists in the frenzied ghoul camp just because you think I'm too low level to know about the place.  Lower Guk is infamous for lists, and I've seen the frenzied list grow past 10 people on different nights.  By the way, the monk that was in the group while you were there was on the list.  When his predecessor left, he was still in the Greater Faydark.  The group sent him tells and waited for him instead of moving down the monk list (there were lists for monks, tanks, nukers, healers, and enchanters - not just ONE list, but different ones).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Again, you know so much for someone who wasnt there.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Sure I was.  I was there from the camp break-in that morning.  I wasn't playing.  I was, however, watching.  I saw the 5 sentinels that were pulled and killed.  I saw the 3 frenzied ghouls that were killed, each dropping a moonstone ring.  When the person playing logged off, I logged on.  In essence, I was still watching while Sihl was logged on.  I was talking to other people who were in the group, since I couldn't believe anyone would have the gall to insist on having another LORE item, let alone the FBSS. <p><table border=1 bgcolor=black align=right><td><img src="http://www.balista.com/lapuslg/iwxani.gif"></td></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthurk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thurk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/18/00 2:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CAught me red handed</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;Yep.
