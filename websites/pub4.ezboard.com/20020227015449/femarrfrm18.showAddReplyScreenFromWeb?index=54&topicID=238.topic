<br>
I am too tired to reply atm except for one thing - <br>
<br>
I think the main difference here Lurikeen is that I have a moral standard in which I believe and one which i strive to adhere to.  I feel certain things are morally wrong because of the effect they have upon each of us as people, on our relationships, on the world, and on our spirit.  Committing these moral wrongs may be justified in cases, and the temporary result of them may indeed be &quot;good.&quot;  I stated this before again and again, but you chose to ignore this.  <br>
<br>
You still miss the point.    <br>
<br>
Absolutely, I feel that lying is morally wrong.  In all cases.  However, if you are asking would I lie to protect the life of my child - yes of course I would. It would still be a lie, and morally, be wrong, but I would choose to lie yes.  Choosing it in order to have a good result does not change the nature of the moral - I believe it is morally wrong to lie.  Period.  <br>
<br>
It is idealistic, of course we all will still lie, but if we have no ideal or moral that we shouldn't lie, then where do we lower our standards to?<br>
<br>
Do you now understand?<br>
<br>
We are talking about two choices in how you live your life really.  Do you have a moral standard and follow it, or do you allow popular trends to dictate right and wrong?  I am not talking laws I am saying popular thought (you know like mini skirts - here today gone tomorrow).<br>
<br>
Last point to make tonight - you took my Clinton statement out of context.  Go back and reread it.  In context, you will see that when I state I would answer the questions if asked, I was referring to a congressional hearing.  Not a public message board.  I never stated I liked the fact that Clinton was asked these questions, in fact I stated the contrary.  I also feel it was dirty politics.  If you read carefully, you will see that.  What I argued was the point that lying is wrong and he did not HAVE to lie.  You disagree with that, fine.  you think the situation forced him to lie, fine.  I don't agree.  Yay, we are all happy to disagree, whoopee, move on.  Your point is not valid Lurikeen about my not answering your personal, rude questions.  I am not the President, and you are not part of a congressional hearing.  Choosing not to answer you is not an indication that I couldn't handle it, its an answer in and of itself Lurikeen.  I will not answer those questions in this forum.  Take me to court and i'll answer if asked and if I swore to tell the truth.  <br>
<br>
You should definitely see the difference here.<br>
<br>
More some other time if I feel like it.  Personally, I think we've exhausted the conversation.  You've stated what you believe and Ive stated mine.  Mine may be stricter or more idealistic, but its no less valid than yours.<br>

<br>
First, I agree with the statement &quot;...certain things are morally wrong because of the effect they have upon each of us....&quot; I think I had stated as much early on.<br>
<br>
I believe that we disagree on what constitutes a &quot;moral&quot;. I think a &quot;moral&quot; is a principle relating to a set of principles, values, and virtues; a.k.a. a system of Ethics. I see our disagreement turning on a perception of what each other's system of ethics may look like. Here is an example:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;We are talking about two choices in how you live your life really.

<br>
I believe you think that because I am an atheist I do not follow a &quot;moral standard&quot;, that some how I just follow &quot;popular thought&quot;. Of course, I don't know what you mean by &quot;moral standard&quot; so I think that you are following a system of ethics based upon a literal interpretation of the Bible. I think somewhere in &quot;there&quot; is a source of confusion and we are not really seeing what the other is saying. So let me work from my assumptions for the moment... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>

<br>
Your point is well taken. Under oath you are saying that you would in fact answer the question. I believe we are talking past each other on this point after reviewing the previous posts. So let me clear up my end. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am saying that you found the questions I asked rude and insulting. I asked if you would really answer them before a congressional hearing, and doubted you would based upon your responses (I believe the distinction you make between answering such questions in a public forum or under oath really trivializes the nature of the point I was making: such questions are improper no matter where asked and do not deserve an answer). I also pointed out that such questions being asked of the President is equally as rude and should not have been asked to begin with. Dirty politics.<br>
<br>
I think we both agree that the questions should not be asked of the President (or similar questions), again &quot;dirty politics&quot;. We disagree over the end result if the questions are asked. You seem to be saying that the President was morally bound to answer such questions &quot;truthfully&quot;. No other answer would be &quot;right&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. In the case of Bill Clinton there was really only two options: answer the question &quot;truthfully&quot; or obfuscate the issue by telling a lie under oath. Silence is not an option in a congressional hearing. Especially if you are the President of the USA. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We are going to disagree on the &quot;lie&quot; bit due, in part, because we are mutually confusing each other's view on ethics (very easy to do in a forum like this). Also, we percieve the &quot;moral world&quot; from two very different ethical systems. Neither the twain shall meet, I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  However, I believe that Clinton was right in trying to confuse the issue with his answer. I base my view over his lie in part on the point that the asking of the questions was not permissable and should never have been asked. I also believe that any red blooded married man who loves his family should lie to the grave about sexual impropriety to protect the reputation of his family, if he can get away with it. Why? Sex outside of marriage is a trivial thing and is not morally blameworthy. Hence should not be used as a test of morality. The only reason why there is a problem with sex outside of marriage is that the predominate moral view over sex in the USA is based upon an antiquated Puritan principle that sex is a necessary evil resulting from the fall of Adam and Eve. Recall that the view is Eve was cursed by God to bear children because of her sinful act at tempting Adam with the fruit of the Tree, hence the act of impregnation is &quot;evil&quot;, too.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the act of sex between consenting adults is not a moral act at all. It is simply a pleasurable biological function (again, some see &quot;pleasure&quot; as evil, too). I believe it is wrong to politicize sex, let alone force the issue of monogamy as some moral litmus test on our politicians. Knowing that many politicians like to appeal to Puritanical views over the &quot;morality&quot; of sex for political gain, I would have justified lying about the blow job from Monica, too, had I been Bill Clinton.<br>
<br>
I know we will disagree, Lukaria. I wanted to reiterate some points only for the sake of clarity. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
