I finally get to do a multiple response to various posts.  I’m an uber-flamer now!  Hmm, really should get around to flaming at some point.  But, here we go!<br>
<br>
Carathos Ollathir:<br>
“And, just out of curiosity, how many genderless people do you know?”<br>
<br>
Roughly half the people mentioned on this board are genderless.  The scammer mentioned in the first post is genderless.  I’m assuming your avatar is male based on the –os ending of your name, but I don’t know.  Ditto Malganar (except –ar ending).  Mr Bodie is obviously presenting male.  Mitch the Blonde could be either, and I would lean male except I believe from other posts Mitch is a female played by a male (and if I’m remembering wrong, Mitch, I apologize). Luvia Hoodyhoo I would guess is a female character, but no proof.  Toein I know is a male avatar as we’ve raided together, but just by name I wouldn’t know.  Gloriana identifies herself as female.  This takes me from your post to the top of my page.  Results:  2 I’m guessing male character based on name, 1 pretty sure male character based on name, 1 I’m guess female character based on name, one female character played by male, one male character met in game, and one self identified female.  Sum:  2 identified RL genders (and both only because it is asserted by the person or other people).  So talking to people online, I know quite a few genderless people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If I didn’t have a picture, would you know what gender my character was?  Probably not.  Know what set of plumbing I have on this side of the keyboard?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Malkuth Inferis:<br>
<br>
Oh, I agree totally!  Ghey and gay, a term used in EQ (and outside it as well…I’ve heard it used RL for the same purpose) to mean stupid by people who also know it is the default term for homosexuals.  I’m more open to talking about using women names to insult men is sexist because I think most people don’t realize what’s going on when they do it.  Using gay to mean stupid is openly hate language and I don’t bother to discuss it here.  I /report it in game.  Yes, I talk to them first, and say “Please don’t do this because…” and if they pesist, I /report them.  Flame me if you want.  I’ve had friends hospitalized because they have sex with members of their own gender and were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Most of them have shown more courage, conviction, humor, and intelligence than I see in most of the people who use gay/ghey in game.<br>
<br>
To Everyone else:<br>
<br>
My issue came not from use the word whore or the original post.  Fori was insulted when it was assumed the EC Whore was female (no gender was specified in the original post).  Ghie is arguing not the use of whore, but of hate language as a whole.  I can only argue my own argument, which came from one particular post:<br>
<br>
**  &quot;generic derrogatory term.. substitute, 'cunt, bitch, slit, twat, slut, dyke&quot;  **<br>
<br>
This was in my initial post, I’m sorry I can’t get a quote function to work properly so it got buried. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The fact that it IS a generic derogatory to call a man a bitch, a cunt, etc., is sexist is what I’m trying to argue here.  I don’t care about women being called female insults (though preferably not to me, unless I deserve it, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), nor do I care about male being called male insults, so please don’t call me a hypocrite.  <br>
<br>
What I care about is the use of female terms works as an insult to men.  To call a man a bitch and have it be in insult is based in it being insulting for a man to be called a woman.  It is not insulting to call a woman a dick (well, it is in theory) because it so very rarely happens.  That is because it is not an insult to call a woman a man, but it is to call a man a woman.  This only works because it is worse to be a woman than a man.  That is what people are saying when they call a man a bitch, a cunt or what have you.  Whore is different because while it has a heavy gender connotation, its main point is about someone who sells their body for money.  But most of the ones on the above list are basically calling a man a woman.<br>
<br>
This is what annoys me.  Women are people.  They are equal to men in abilities, in rights, in strengths and accomplishments.  Women are not inferior to men. To be used as an insult suggests that they aren’t.  So in a way, it is a very good insult.  Not only does it insult the targeted male, but it also insults about 50% of the population of the world at the same time.  Now THAT is a flame!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And Caoilfhionn, don’t worry.  I am trying to raise consciousness here a little.  I just want people to realize “Hey, you are being sexist” if you think it is insulting to call a man or a non-gender (which in English defaults to male, and in EQ is prolly male anyway based on player base proportions).  I am not up in arms.  I haven’t gone home and blasted at my roomie about this.  In fact, I don’t think he even knows about this discussion.  I’m not crying in my room over how hurt I am.  I read this board, respond to this thread, and move on with my life.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Of course, trying to get my thoughts out on a complex issue has resulted in a long post which most people aren't going to read thoroughly, so to anyone that DOES get this far--want to start a pool of how many people are going to accuse me again of being upset by the typing of the word 'whore', or that I think it's okay to use 'dick' to men, but not to use 'bitch' to woman, or any of the other things misattributed to me. Hee hee.<br>
<br>
As far as the original post, I agree that lying about how much money you have is pretty crummy and I think Seann’s response to raise the price is pretty damn elegant.  I’ll have use that in the future.<br>

And Salenie, I'm not trying to take away from your argument, but I believe that calling a woman a man can be just as derogatory as calling a man a woman.  It may not hurt you personally, but it is indeed hurtful to many women that I've known.<br>

second, Salenie you made a good point.

<br>
Heh...supports the idea that EZ Board presences are non-gender.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I wonder how many others I got wrong!<br>
<br>
As far as women being called a male insulte, I agree...it prolly would be insulting.  It is also FAR less common because our society doesn't see being called a male-thing insulting, but it does see calling a male a female-thing.<br>
<br>
Notice I'm not really bitching at anyone or screaming, just trying to persuade (which I know is ultimately doomed) or at least enlighten to the reality.  Eventually people will stop responding to this thread or my arguement in it and it will pass on to the next one.  I pick up a societal awareness cause about once every three months here and freely admit that it will most likely come to an impasse sooner or later. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I see it as being insulting because you are thus saying the target is lacking in the strength's that gender should be possessed of.  This works both ways and is not meant to be discriminate to either gender in particular.<br>
<br>
Example: That guy throws like a girl.<br>
<br>
The male persona is supposedly good at sports due to physiological advantages, thus saying one is non-male means one is not good at sports. I don't see this as being insulting to girls, simply that the insult is implying the guy is lacking in traits a male should possess.<br>
<br>
Other example, previoulsly stated: That girl is pretty butch.<br>
<br>
This is a case of applying male traits to be insulting to the female.  I don't see it as being insulting to males, simply that the insult is applying the opposite gender to state the female is lacking in her own feminine strengths.<br>
<br>
The concept there is an inferior gender is an outdated and people who actually still believe this are mostly small-minded.  I'm certainly not blissfully ignorant that gender based discrimation no longer exists. What I do believe is in popular culture nowadays gender based insults are meant to point to the lack of one's own strengths rather than the inferiority of the opposite gender.<br>
<br>
My examples may not be perfect btw, but I wanted to come up with something and I'm not gonna spend an hour at work writing this, heh.<br>

While it is true that certain insults came about due to people's views on gender roles, by accepting those gender roles as valid you do far more to hurt women in general (and men, for that matter) than you do by defending them against gender-based insults. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

<br>
I think the real insult is not in implying they are lacking in characteristics that are associated with thier own gender but rather that an individual is displaying characteristics that are commonly associated with members of the other sex.  <br>
<br>
But the phrases 'like a girl' and 'like a man' are particularly indicative of the presumption that men are superior to women.  &quot;Like a girl&quot; implies weakness and inferiority.  &quot;Like a man&quot; implies strength and superiority.  Just think about when and how the phrases are used.<br>
<br>
Saying someone throws &quot;like a girl&quot; is insulting to women because it implies that girls cannot be and are not good athletes. It is insulting to men because it is saying that the man in question is &quot;like a girl&quot; in that he cannot be and is not a good athlete. <br>
<br>
If it the base belief was not that women were incapable of athleticism then the insult would have no power.<br>
<br>
Yes, we are all aware that the base assumption is not true. And most folk would interpret the phrasology simply as a slam on their strength and grace in throwing a ball. BUT the underlying assumption is still the gender equivalent of racism.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is that I am a girl and even I can get annoyed when someone tells me I throw 'like a girl'. Even when I know that there are innumerable examples of women who have strong arms. Such is the strength of the implication that girls are 'less than' boys.  go figure...<br>
<br>
Maybe I should buck up and take it &quot;like a man&quot;  <br>
<br>
Odd phrase that one, when there is so much evidence in history of womens ability to rise above adversity, struggle through harsh conditions, lead and survive to be victorious when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds.<br>
<br>
On second thought, I'd rather be 'like a girl'<br>

In order for our species to continue, the two have to coexist.  Why spend time fighting over which is better when you can have fun exploring each others differences. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

I'm arguing we shouldn't use the concept of women (in whatever form) as an insult to men, because it assumes that women are inferior to men (else why would it be an insult?).

I want to say the USE of then word whore is NOT.. ok let me say that again for the people who cant read.. <br>
<br>
THE USE OF THE WORD DOES NOT OFFEND ME...<br>
<br>
how ever over use can.<br>
<br>
I was offended by the equation of whore to a female. <br>
<br>
As someone already stated...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

now lets see what the definition of the word was *I* found:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

A prostitute. <br>
A person considered sexually promiscuous. <br>

intr.v. whored, whor·ing, whores <br>
To associate or have sexual relations with prostitutes or a prostitute. <br>
To accept payment in exchange for sexual relations. <br>
To compromise one's principles for personal gain. <br>
