After being on soo many Naggy raids (from 42 to today) I was kinda tired of seeing his big red hide!<br>
Now let me state that those of you who I have raided with in the past, Golems and (WISH I COULD REMEMBER from the hole), I have enjoyed every one of those raids and while not always happy about what I was there for and NBG, I understood! (AND ALSO HEARD if I had of stayed longer, I would have been happy! =/ ) I DID MY JOB and many have said I do it well! and these leaders have ALSO done their jobs well and NEVER &quot;bailed&quot; to another char.<br>
However...the vox raid that started after Naggy went down (12:30 PM PST) was still in prep at 8pm PST (NOT A GOOD SIGN) But hey I thought let's go see the monsterous best it'll be fun and won't loose much! =)<br>
Well it was a disaster and the leader REFUSED to accept responsability for it, acting all high and mighty!<br>
First off, it was (if you could not tell my first Vox raid) So I knew nothing of binding at the zone, til AFTER the buffs had been dispensed and we were in chat. When I mentioned this (BY THE WAY I ALSO DO NOT KNOW PERMAFROST that well and the leader was kind enough to come get me! (and she NEVER bothered to say Hey Cleric, you should bind here!) When I mentioned that I found out in chat (Which was the FIRST I HEARD of it, MIND YOU SHE PICKED ME UP AT THE ZONE,WHERE I WAS SUPPOSE TO BE BOUND) she said I should have &quot;run back to the zone, DUH&quot;. Well hmmm This makes sense we are buffed and I need to say Wait guys I gotta run to the zone and bind myself. (this sound right to ANYONE EVER ON A RAID wait til you are buffed and then go bind, let the buffs run out oh and the mobs to start spawning again?) <br>
Then without letting anyone in my group know (Was I the only caster in the group, MAYBE) She switched chars! (but wait a guildmate of mine was in another group and he too did not know what the heck was going on. )<br>
So while we were on the CR I kept saying bring my corpse please and I felt like I was being ignored, not that THAT was her fault, she was too busy having a pally pull EVERY goblin in the zone to show off THIS OTHER Chars wizzie abilities. Of surse they were not on her, they were on me for healing the poor pally that ALMOST died due to this act!<br>
Oh and when I FINALLY did get my corpse, it was too old to rez! And well AS some people that read the dragon and planes area know I am trying real hard to get to 46 so I can ATLEAST visit a plane, but Moltaenya/Ironlute Just kept saying it is only exp. (true but it was lost needlessly due to the LOUSY leadership on this Raid!) And I KNOW I am NOT the only one that feels this way about this particular raid. <br>
Maybe she was just having a bad day, HEY that happens but ATLEAST she could have accepted SOME responsibility, but nope she could not.<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening.<br>

Since it wasn't a planned raid you don't have a full list of people who you know are coming.  You've got to sit around and wait for people to log on and ask if they're interested.  Well this takes time, and time we did take to get people together.  During this time we had a lot of smart asses and people who couldn't wait.  We even had enchanters who spammed the whole raid with their AE memory Flux spell and gated without saying anything.  These things were VERY hard on Moltaenya when she was trying to get things together.  Stop your lousy bitching and complaining and live with your little half bubble or less of lost exp, it's not hard to get back.  Besides, you're a cleric.... idiot...<br>
<br>
I hate stooping to such a low level, but gawd!  People put so much real worth into this stupid gold bar.  So many people should have been put in diapers, and most of those people didn't even die as many times as the corpse pullers did!  Now go suck on your pacifier or grow up and take it like a man, sheesh...<br>
<br>
People have raids, some are successful and others are failures.  You can't always pick which ones you go on because they're fairly random.  Example, I heard Darmu's first Hate raid was great, real great, and when I heard he was doing a Fear raid I thought it'd be cool to tag along.  Well things didn't go out as great as expected, but at least we all got out with our stuff and a few things.  This was one of Moltaenya's first dragon leads, and most everyone has their first and second failures before they really get the hang of it.  From what I was told we almost ALMOST had Vox dead, she was at 5% health when everyone died.  If you ask me, Moltaenya took ENOUGH of the blame, ENOUGH of the guilt in the raid spread amongst the whole of the people who actually were brave enough to hang around and wait for replacement after replacement to come.<br>
<br>
If you really wanted your corpse and exp back so bad you could have went in and tried getting it yourself.  Now stop whining, there's nothing you can do about it.<br>

You should have seen some of the threads from a year ago when Nire was killing at least 9 out of 10 Dragon pops.  I wasn't quite around for them but before that they were just as bad when Da`Kor, Midnight Sojourn and the rest of the server were butting heads over them (back when Vox and Naggy were the end game).<br>

my above posts relating to Eltherion are in jest, and do not in anyway reflect Etherion's raiding abilities in any way, He used to get so many people whineing at him when he used to do pickup raids, i still wonder up til today how he kept his temper.<br>
<br>
i will never forget the fun I used to have raiding with him.<br>

Dragons take time. If you are not ready for an extended raid / prep you should have never agree'd to go. I think three or four people just left after the ice giants were dead. They were looking for replacements that took time. That is the biggest reason Giants started respawning on the raid. <br>
<br>
2.) &lt;--- Pulled corpses from under Vox's Feet. I grabed the nearest corpse and basicly send player X a tell /consent me. I pulled monkeys I pulled clerics, I pulled everybody that I saw. And yes also died grabing corpses. I came back and started pulling more bodies. A few people had a guildmate bring up a coffin and summon their body. That was an option that you choose not to explore. If you got your body back and got all your gear and lost some experience you should be happy. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry to say I will go on a Dragon Raids again but nothing that will be a pickup. I was with the same leaders the previous night and we killed Naggy with some deaths but Naggy went down. It was pre-planed and everybody on the raid accepted the raid as what it is. Dragon Raids takes time you need to be ready to plan on 5 hours for a dragon raid. I was up until 7am GMT pulling corpes and I had to skip out on work today because I was pulling bodies. <br>

The prep went normal and everyone got their stuff.  We were given directions in chat, loot order was thrown out, we charged in and started beating Vox down but we just didn't make it by a thread (from what I heard at least, but I don't think Moltaenya would make that up).  Don't call Moltaenya a bad raid leader just because we tried and failed.  I've been on lots of experienced raid leader raids that have been real rocky before I chose to log.<br>
<br>
And what I call Tuasai an idiot for is for when she screamed &quot;GEEZ THANKS I CANT GET EXP BACK!&quot; when she checked her corpse.  She sounded like such a red-faced screaming kid with tears coming out of her eyes like she's trying to get something, and then post here complaining some more.  Like she's trying to rub the pain and grief of the whole damn raid in Moltaenya's face because it wasn't a success just to get something out of it.  Experience gain is not your significant other, get it through your head.  It's not important enough to whine and grow a diaper with.  I was there for 12+ hours sticking it out with Moltaenya and her friends who started the raid from the very beginning.  I was there when there were buffs, in fact I was one of the buffers.  I was there when we fought and died, and I was there when we had corpse recovery.  I also spent another 30 minutes to an hour or so moving my characters around from Velious to Permafrost to get my corpse back.  This went from around 2pm-3:30am central.  Along with that I also lost a half bubble of exp in level 52.  Tell me, should I put on a diaper, suck my thumb, and bitch and whine like a baby, too?  Hell no, but I guess not everyone can take shit as much as me.<br>

So being on Moltaenya was the best - especially when there were no TPs in CoM (where I was bound) or in EJ.  Want to know I what did?  I grabbed my 52 wizard that was fully equipped.  I told my group I was, I told the other raid leaders I was and that they should let everyone else know too.  I sent tells to those people I wanted to help me on the CR with my wizard.  When I reached Perma I shouted it a few times.  <br>
<br>
Zel got out his enchanter and did a money transfer from earlier (actually, I was going to buy my rebreathers for my epic before I got tells for Vox, but was too encumbered to hold the cash and run through WK that I gave it to Zel's alter).  I took the  cash with my wizard and BOUGHT COFFINS.  <br>
<br>
Being the leader that I was I had already told a few people on the raid that since a CR was MY responsibility, I would use MY cash to buy coffins.  Anyhow, if you're really that pissed that I &quot;bailed with Moltaenya&quot; and that I was such a poor leader and couldn't do anything, fine.  I guess you ARE right though, sitting on my ass or running around looking for a naked TP the majority of the time not having ANY clue what was going on with my fellow raiders.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, you didn't help rez, you didn't offer to do a DA suicide run like a few others who had this ability did, you sat and whined.<br>
<br>
And yes, even before the buffline, I had said SEVERAL times that casters should have bound at the zone (I even emphasized it when the mistimed IGs that another non raid group had before started repopping near the hall).  No death loops right?<br>
<br>
Like I stated in my post under Dragons and Planes, I said there were a few bad peeps out there, I suppose you wanted to reveal yourself huh?<br>
<br>
Tuasai, you were the first person I put on my ignore list.<br>

Especially when it's in as remote an area as permafrost?  Why should the leader have had to tell you to bind?  I've never seen Naggy or Vox, but I think even I would have known to do that without being told.  How on earth did you manage 45 levels without thinking to do that on your own?  Do you expect your group leaders to tell you when to heal, as well?<br>
