He said &quot;like you&quot;, it wasn't a personal slam.  Translation, the non-established pick up raid leaders.  Gorndax (going to steal him as the example since Sage did) has been doing it a lot longer than you or even myself, and has established himself as a raid leader and most people respect that fact.  So far, you've led a couple Plane raids, which is a drop in the bucket. <br>
<br>
&quot;about the &quot;keeping the spot on the rotation&quot;...who said we wanted to keep our spot?&quot; <br>
<br>
Why wouldn't you?  Doing it just for shits and giggles to piss off the guild in the rotation and just to say you can is assanine and just begging for you to get ripped.  The guilds involved go in there with the power to take the kill and keep it.  This isn't Naggy or Vox. <br>
<br>
&quot;i noticed torm said that VS isn't meant for pick up groups...why the hell not? why can't everyone have a shot at something? who the hell are you, being able to say that? &quot;<br>
<br>
Because you don't intend to play by the way things are done.  There are a lot of respected guilds on this rotation who earned their spot and keep it.  If you intended to keep your spot and fight for it like the higher guilds do, I'd say go for it but you don't.  That's why the hell not.  You have zero respect for anyone else in that rotation, except your own selfish needs.  Sage and I lead quite a few raids (with only one real yucky day so far *knock on wood*) and we wouldn't go anywhere near VS because of the simple fact that we don't intend to stay in the rotation.  <br>
<br>
Like I said you can jump in the rotation all you want, but if you fail your CR is going to be ugly and the only ones with the ability to get those corpses back, will be the guilds in the rotation.  Do you really want to ask them to help you when you just screwed them over?   <p>Tormentcia

If you can get a strong enough group together, and beat the guild on the rotation to the punch (or get them to let you go first), VS is fair game.  If you gank the guild in the rotation, so what?  They'll get to try again in a few days.  If any of them get pissed off at you, bring it to this board and watch them get flamed.<br>
<br>
If a pickup group really took out VS a couple weeks ago, the rotation's days are numbered anyway.  VS is not an uber level mob anymore.  He's really only important because he's a bottleneck for the wizard epic quest.  His other loot is nice, but it hasn't been top of the line stuff for a long time.<br>
<br>
The reason why VS is a big deal is that killing him is regarded as a rite of passage for the newer guilds, and being part of the rotation is regarded as prestigious.  If a pickup group took him down, you can throw all of that out the window. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usiilverain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siilverain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/31/01 7:36:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how many people are interested in a VS pick up?</span><hr size=1> I would like to mention that VS is also required for the druid epic. Though technically we can wait to &quot;resurrect&quot; the Remains of VS to get our epic pieces...The only thing the &quot;resurrected&quot; VS drops are 2 of the glowing stones for the druid epic.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think its a great idea to get a pick-up organized to take him out. I know that most of you believe the current rotation policy shouldn't be disturbed, but why should mobs such as VS be held above those that are not in large guilds?  Why should we not be able to win a Diamond Encrusted Staff (for example) on a random? Rather than having to pay outrageous amounts to someone else just because you aren't in &quot;the rotation&quot;?  I mean each of those larger guilds gets a chance at him every week. What would the big deal be with waiting one more week while some of the &quot;smaller&quot; guys give it a shot?<br>
<br>
Do I think it should be done first without asking? No, that would be rude.  However their own policy is you have to rough arm your way into the rotation in the first place. I do believe that if you are willing to create a pick-up raid to take VS out, you should also plan on staying in the rotation that you just rough armed your way into.  Doing anything else would just make you look plan silly &amp; would most likely discourage the rotation allowing another pick-up raid anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Though I know I can't assume what these guilds would say to a pick-up raid request, I would hope that they remember the time they weren't in a large guild and was in the same spot that most of the server is in.  My view point is of course skewed to the several hundred on EMarr that aren't in a large guild as I myself am in a smaller guild as well.<br>

<br>
Point is, I'm guildless; have no intention of joining one of the guilds that is on the rotation.  So, for right now at least, my chances of doing that part of my epic is somewhere between slim and none.  My only chance might be with a pick-up.  <br>
<br>
I would like to think that the uber guilds would accept the fact that someone is trying to complete part of their epic (especially if their only reason to be there is just to VS because it's their turn), they would be kind enough to either skip their turn on the rotation, or let some of us in on their &quot;guild&quot; raid.  Am I hoping for too much?  Probably.<br>
<br>
Is it possible that eventually, the rotation to VS would become boring and there would be more room for us &quot;non-ubers&quot;?  Bleh.  Never happen, I guess.  More wishful thinking on my part.<br>

<br>
This whole idea started for those of us that are getting up there in our levels and are happy with our small, close-knit guilds and will most likely never join up with a large guild that has VS on a rotation.  Why should we not be allowed a crack at him and the items he drops? Why should we be expected to pay and/or trade two arms and a leg for an item that might drop if we got in there. <br>
<br>
If we fail, we fail. If we win, then that means a couple people on that pick-up raid will walk away very happy.  <br>

Well, after quite the long battle it boiled down to... get together as VS is up, kill him before the other guild gets a chance. It's yours, no questions asked. And you can be in the rotation, doesn't matter if it is a pick up raid, you just can't get help from guilds that are *IN* the rotation.<br>

  Pick up raid wants to take down VS?  Beat us (the rotation guild there) and there will be no problems.  Do it several times in a row?  &lt;shrug&gt;  your call.<br>
<br>
  We'd prefer it that you'd join the rotation if you want to make it a regular event, because it's fairer to everyone.<br>
<br>
  But if you can beat one of us to the spawn you have as much right to try to take it down without interference as any other guild.<br>

Does he really?  Has this been confirmed?  I guess that it's possible but he hasn't dropped a Stone in the past 6 Rotation kills and he has never dropped us a stone.  Of course this is the same critter that can totally hose you by dropping 3 worthless staves or a crappy spell so it really wouldn't suprise me.<br>
<br>
Camp VSR.  He's much easier and more reliable.  You don't need a raid force to get him (1 group that is balanced will demolish him).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I know that the day is coming when a pickup raid will take him down.  I’ve said it many times before, he is NOT hard at all if you know how to kill him.  However to do it, you really need a solid force and good organization.  Everything needs to go flawless or he will demolish the raiding force in a matter of seconds.  You are also going to need higher levels.  You cannot kill Venril Sathir by throwing 30 people who are level 48 – 53 at him.  He’ll laugh at you and proceed to kill you one at a time.  With all of that said though, I stand by my original statement, a pickup raid will take him down and probably sooner than later.<br>
<br>
I also want to comment on the reasoning behind killing Venril Sathir.  If you’re doing it for Epics and loot, that is one thing.  He drops very good loot (and believe me, PC still needs all of the Greaves we can get).  As it stands, the only reason you need to kill the real Venril Sathir for Epics is for the Wizard one.  It has also been said that many guilds have all of their VS Wizard Staves so the best suggestion for you would be to check with the current guild on the rotation and try to make an arrangement with them.  Fitzroy (I think) is doing a very good job of keeping track of the VS Rotation now so just check with him and you’ll know who is up.  If you want to kill the big guy to be a part of the killing, that’s also cool.  He’s a neat fight and it’s an awesome feeling to say that you’ve helped kill him.  And as I’ve said many times, a pickup raid will take him down so if you’re patient, you’ll get your shot at him (and as I keep saying, probably sooner than later).<br>
<br>
However a LOT of you are being EXTREMELY childish and are saying that the only reason you want to kill him is to piss off the uber guilds.  If this is your intention and reasoning for wanting to kill VS, then that’s sad…<br>

                            This leads me to believe he does indeed still drop the stones. If I am wrong, oops.<br>

You’ve been pretty straight forward and you fit into a combination of wanting to kill Venril Sathir for Loot and because it’s cool.  Both of which are fine with me and I can understand.  <br>
<br>
I’m also fairly certain that the information on the Stones is inaccurate.  At one time, Venril Sathir DID drop the stones required for your Epic but this has been changed (as you already know).  It’s been pretty much confirmed that the Venril Sathir Remains are the only way to get your Stones now.  This means that your bottleneck is the Jade Reaver (and the Rangers is a combination of the Jade Reaver and the Stone from Hate).  He also spawns reliably after the death of Venril Sathir.  Find out when he went down and camp Karnors with some friends when he is due to pop.  Keep all of the items necessary to spawn him and you can have him easily.<br>
<br>
Finally, to be quite blunt, the Elder Spiritist’s Greaves suck.  They’re not bad but risk vs. reward is WAY off on this one.  Here are some choices for you.<br>
<br>
Elder Spiritist's Greaves<br>
MAGIC ITEM <br>
AC: +10 Str: +6 Wis: +6 Mana: +55 <br>
Weight: 7.5<br>
Classes: Druid <br>
Effect: Skin Like Diamond<br>
<br>
These come off of Venril Sathir who is a 3 day spawn and who has a 50/50 chance to drop legs for each of his drops.  He also drops a number of other Class Specific Legs which means that the chances of dropping a particular set are even lower.<br>
<br>
Gladiator's Chain Leggings<br>
LORE ITEM NO DROP <br>
AC: +17 Str: +2 Wis: +6 Cha: +4 Magic Resist: +10 HP: +20 <br>
Weight: 0.0<br>
Classes: Ranger Shaman Druid Cleric Paladin Shadowknight Bard Rogue Warrior <br>
<br>
These come off of a Named Giant in the Arena of Kael Drakkel.  In our experiences with killing him, he has dropped these leggings 7 times out of 8 which has equipped most of our Druids with them.  These are quite possibly the best Legs in the game for the Druid (barring SS, Kael quest armor and potential drops in TOV North).  My Cleric has these from a time when no Druid’s needed them and I absolutely love them.  These are slightly difficult to get as the Giant spawns INSIDE the arena behind about 3 or 4 Protectors of Zek.  You will need a solid crew to clear the way to the Arena and a good Feign Death Puller to get singles, but after a few raids it becomes much easier after you see how the area works.<br>
<br>
Kromrif Military Leggings <br>
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP <br>
AC: +14 Str: +6 Wis: +5 Cold Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +5 <br>
Weight: 4.0<br>
Classes: All Classes <br>
Races: All Races <br>
<br>
This is the result of a fairly easy quest.  There are a couple of camps involved and the final portion is buggy but it’s still an easy quest to do.  These are a solid choice for any Druid.<br>
<br>
Rowyl's Greaves of Nature&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
MAGIC ITEM NO DROP &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
AC: +9 Str: +6 Wis: +7 Cold Resist: +3 Mana: +70 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Weight: 7.0&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Classes: Druid &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Races: Halfling Wood Elf Half Elf Human &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Effect: Circle of Misty<br>
<br>
These are the result of the Thurgadin Quest Armor for Druids.  It only takes a couple of groups that are balanced of level 50 – 55’s and one group 55+ to reach the area that erodded and corroded armor drops.  The quest gems for Priest legs are fairly common and are easily obtainable.<br>
<br>
Greaves of Harmony <br>
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP <br>
AC: +10 Str: +6 Wis: +8 Magic Resist: +3 Mana: +65 <br>
Weight: 4.0<br>
Classes: Druid <br>
Races: Halfling Wood Elf Half Elf Human <br>
Effect: Circle of Misty<br>
<br>
This is probably the hardest alternative but there is potential for other classes to benefit as well.  These drop off of Disciples of Innoruuk on the 2nd Floor of the Plane of Hate.  Drop rates there are notorious for being crappy and it takes a strong raid and a lot of time to reach the 2nd Floor.<br>
