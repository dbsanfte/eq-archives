We play some *very* heavy stuff (on par with Entombed/Dark Throne) but with piano taking a big part in the tune.  Piano/Heavy Metal don't sound like they'd go together very well, i know, that's the point.  Sounds pretty good though.<br>
<br>
Anyway to the point.  Most of our recording these days is done in a studio, but before we had the studio available we used our home stereo to record and we generally had to use headphones (since I live in a cul-de-sac).  We were able to work fine, and actually produced some of our best songs in that little home setup.<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for you having a fat, miserable, wanker of a neighbour that won't let you play your music, but it's really not that bad using headphones.  Granted you have to use an electric piano/organ, but it's better than not being able to record anything.<br>

This despite the fact that you couldn't hear my music from outside the apartment, while all around us in the same complex we have mariachi and rap music blaring from wide open windows all day long.<br>
<br>
The old woman confronted me on the sidewalk on the street on evening while I was standing outside with a friend, and began haranging me about my music being too loud, my footsteps being too loud, the way I flush the toilet being too loud, the way I turn on the shower being too loud . . . seriously.  It was at this moment I realized that she was actually a fruitbat in human form.  I had never, ever, raised my voice to an older person in my life, but when this old woman said, &quot;I guess you just make so much noise because you're an elephant&quot; -- for God's sake, I'm 6'3 and 220 pounds!  I'm just a tall guy, not some morbidly obese hippo!!! -- I lost it.  I went off.  I roared in her face about how she was crazy and insane, and told her to go @#%$ herself.<br>
<br>
The next day, she baked me some bread and apologized.<br>
<br>
Our civilized detente continued for a while.  She would pigeonhole me on the apartment steps and tell me about her and her 45-year-old daughter's &quot;female problems.&quot;  I had suddenly become her best friend.<br>
<br>
Three months passed.<br>
<br>
Then, one evening, I was listening to some mp3's on my PC -- again, not loudly -- and I suddenly heard and felt a thumping below my feet.  I turned the music *off* so that I could get an idea what the hell was going on downstairs.  A few moments later there came a rapping at my front door.  I opened it to discover the old fruitbat, who yelled at me, &quot;Aren't you going to turn it down?&quot;<br>
<br>
Remember, at this point there was no music at all in my apartment.  &quot;Turn what down?&quot; I asked politely if a bit faceitously.<br>
<br>
&quot;That damn music!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not even on right now.  And wasn't this a dead issue?  I wasn't playing my music a moment ago any more loudly than I ever do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And I've been pounding on the ceiling for months trying to get you to stop!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Urm, no, you haven't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I went to the apartment office and complained but they said I had to come talk to you myself!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was a flat-out lie.  The apartment office wants there to be no conflict between the tenants and has asked anyone with a noise complaint to come to them directly.<br>
<br>
So I said, &quot;Frankly, I doubt that very much.  This is the final time I will ever speak to you on this matter.  My music is not played at an inappropriate level.  I very rarely have friends over and generally am one of the quietest neighbors you will ever have.  So why don't you just @#%$ OFF.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I slammed the door in her face.<br>
<br>
A few moments later there were some VERY angry-sounding footsteps running down the stairs and she slammed her door in frustration.<br>
<br>
First thing the next morning I went to the apartment manager's office and outlined every encounter I'd had with the old woman.  It turned out that she was well-known by them for complaining about every little thing she could -- from cracks in the pavement to toddlers being allowed by their parents to run around naked -- and was regarded as a crank.  &quot;Don't worry about the noise issue,&quot; they said.  &quot;We stopped outside your door a couple of times after her complaints and measured the sound with a decibel meter and could barely tell anything was going on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apparently the next time she went to them to complain, they told her to quit harrassing me or they'd put a nuisance mark on her record.  There has been nary a peep from her for the last three or four months.  When she sees me coming she goes the other way.<br>
<br>
I won.<br>
<br>
I just wish I hadn't had to battle with her at all.<br>

Let the guy bitch.  Just keep doing what you're doing and he can take it up with the authorities, who already agree with you, anyway.  Just, don't let him get to you.

The reason we never did anything about it was because it was the Apartment Manager's apartment right above ours...we found out the thumping sound from the living room was their 50 pound cat jumping from the bar to the floor...it made me laugh every time I heard it from then on.
