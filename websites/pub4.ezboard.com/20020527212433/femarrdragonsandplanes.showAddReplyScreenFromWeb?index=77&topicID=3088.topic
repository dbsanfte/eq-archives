This thread has gotten ridiculous. <br>
<br>
Seolblade posts a near perfect version of what happened.<br>
(The book may have been a loan, it may have been a gift; Eve thinks it was a gift and she being my wife, I would believe her.) Personally, though I believe the book was a gift given, I also believe it should be returned as I see it as a tainted item.<br>
<br>
Everyone in the world hops on and tells him how wrong he was.<br>
<br>
Adarian forgets that every person who got anything while in divine grace got it because they contributed to the guild events at some level and those items continued to help the guild for months after they were allocated. There is no comparison between Eves relationship to DG and Seols relationship to LoR.<br>
<br>
Karna proceeds to spout nonsense in reply to every single post.<br>

Someone pointed out a list of idiots who were at one time invited to LoR without also pointing out that all of those idiots were nearly immediately kicked out.<br>
<br>
Karna proceeds to spout nonsense in reply to every single post.<br>
<br>
Ninnin and some of his friends decided to play pvp in a pvp area and pissed people off. Sure he could have been more tactful or respectful, but PvP is PvP and those warning they give when you step into PvP areas are there for a reason. Note that when he realized what he did (just today the bulb lit) he did actually apologize for it in very vague way a few posts ago.<br>
<br>
Karna proceeds to spout nonsense in reply to every single post. (Someone apparantly has too much free time at work). Karna continues picking at small points and making great leaps of illogic.<br>
<br>
Seolblade returns to the thread and digs himself a little deeper. (Does it matter if you sold it or tried to sell it? They are the same thing) Yes you had a grand tradition of giving stuff to guildmates. I still cannot figure out why you decided that some of the gifts you gave were only loans. Ok, so thats not true, I am quite sure it was you displacing your anger at being guildremoved and asking for some of your more recent gifts back.<br>
<br>
Still waiting on another innane, monolinear thought, post by Karna.<br>

what u said before about this being america, and for us to keep our comments out of this...if this is really america then aren't we allowed to have a free right of speech? you really shoulda told someone that you were going to sell this in the first place, really man.  also, i am SURE someone in the guild could use one of those shields, even if you didn't need you could have at least passed it down.  <br>
i do understand that you have a daughter to attend to, but if you have that daughter why get into a guild that you are never going to assist in raids that take time?   isn't that what a guild is all about? helping each other in the time of need? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29123>Sarlyn Firmwood</a><BR><a href=http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/> 53 Pathfinder</a><BR>

<br>
Vladatoth, you're a friend, but unless you've dramatically changed.. you are very wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you ask the guild for help, that means you are in fact asking to help you complete something that will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> benifit the guild</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and thus if you are upgrading you should pass your hand-me-down to someone in the guild. Thus you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> help two people instead of just your selfish self.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If you want to go out and make yourself rich, or upgrade something purely for yourself, then go out and do it on your own. A guild is not to be used so you can get *uber_item_01* and then go sell it for your own personal profit. &quot;<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly, on a hate raid back when RoN was in existence, you wanted to claim the EM bp all for yourself, and you were unwilling to hand ANY item down, as per the rules that we (meaning the people participating in the raid) usually go by.  You didn't care that the people around you needed an upgrade.  So like I said, unless you changed you are completely wrong.  And kudos to you if you did, I am glad we taught you great loot morals.<br>
<br>
And to the model LoR spokesperson...<br>
<br>
&quot;It was a guild event?  <br>
<br>
oh good god... what have I done?<br>
<br>
/slurks off into the corner &quot;<br>
<br>
Your sarcasm only shows your elitism.  You sir, are by no means, better than anyone else.  You are a horrible example of LoR, and unfortunately, a team is only as strong as its weakest member.  That cliche will always hold true.  <br>
<br>
Sure, any rebuttal you may give me will help boost that ego of yours, but it doesn't matter to me.  I know you'll think about what the people here say about you.  It's a known fact.  If but one person tells another that they are fat, that person will always be looking in a mirror, wondering how to change that.<br>
<br>
LoR if I were you, I would have a serious talk with Ninnin about posting any more immature comments in public.  Especially when his signature reads as..<br>

His words on this board are not recognized by LoR as being representative of LoR. <br>
<br>
However, his being a member or LoR, I am not going to going to say that he and the guild are separate. I will just say that he isn't earning any points with the guild with some of his actions or posts. But, overall, Ninnin has been an excellect guild supporter in his participation on raids and is helpful to guildmembers most of the time, except when they ask for a TL to EJ.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I will have a chat with him or our guildleader will. <br>

<br>
You said you asked for help so many times before. Ever think that the people who saw you asking for help thought that something like this might be in you to start with? I mean, maybe they didnt expect alot of you or see alot in you. <br>
<br>
Also to think giving yourself something will benifit others is a little extreme. I mean really, what would you have really done with your epic? You just woulda solo'd bigger mobs in a shorter time and get yourself more cash. Some reason I doubt 'the guild' would've gotten true benifiet of you getting your epic. If you wanted to help the guild, you wouldnt have been deguilded, the writ would be in the possesion of the person you let loan it, and the shield would be too. Hell you said he/she was wear 'newbie' type gear. What would have been more a boost to a guildie than to give them something as valuable as this? A person who can truely use it.<br>

<br>
Seolblade contributed SQWAT to the guild and its efforts. I infact have the item he needed to complete epic in my bank but he was not awarded it as he has only ONCE stepped up to help the guild and that was only for his personal gain of Jade reaver. <br>
<br>
HE begged and pleaded for help finishing this quest from those that he had no time to help on the numerous guild raids ... cr's ...whatever. In a flash of kindness ( Feeling that he was going to use the item as he was always quick to point out how much WIS it had on it .. and seeing he was a druid. ) others agree to help him hoping that he would then see the nature of our guild ... Helping one helps all!<br>
<br>
Within 24 hours of getting the help he pleaded for getting this shield its posted for sale.<br>
<br>
I cannot blame my mates for feeling used and wronged by this.<br>
<br>
Yes ... yes I know Seol ... "I can't make raids cause I watch my daughter." I would be half inclined to listen to this if I didn't have 3 kids 11 yr, 4 yr and 9 months and manage to make nearly EVERY raid to support those I call friend and family.

Learn to spell the person's name you are making fun of. Especially if it is a relatively easy, four or five letter name.<br>
<br>
Oops, I did it to. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I find it funny everyone believes taking the writ was wrong. Also funny that everyone believes you guys aren't entitled to sheild for helping kill the two end mobs. Even more funny is the fact that more LoR misdeeds have become known since this post started. <br>
<br>
And still, you fail to admit any shortcomings. Until now.<br>
<br>
If Seol told you he was going to use the sheild, then sold it the next day, that is wrong. Lying is almost as bad as stealing. From what I have heard, there was no mention of use, it was just asking for some quest help. Either way, the keeping of a loaned item is theft, plain and simple. That is my point, the rest of the crap I could care less about. This copout &quot;misuse of guild resources&quot; line is pathetic, I help people, I don't &quot;use my resources to benefit others.&quot; I don't see Everquest as a job, and the day I do is the day Kerna will be no more.<br>
<br>
I'm going to bed, more posting to follow I am sure. Will catch up tommorow at my slack job. <br>

P.S. The best thing about playing a Paladin is that you know your friends are there because they like you; not because you can port them, powerlevel them, speed/clarity them, rez them, or farm items for them. They just regard you as an ally, and will always be there whenever you call for assistance. Regardless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubulvyne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bulvyne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/25/02 10:28:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3088.topic&index=87>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..........</span><hr size=1> I have grouped with Ghie and Evelle enough to know that, if Evelle says she was under the impression that the item was a GIFT, then she was indeed under the impression that the item was a GIFT. It's not like her to lie, or cheat, or steal. And if Seol is congratulating her on her new item... well... to me it sounds like Seol really did give the item to Evelle, then got pissed and demanded it back, and is &quot;claiming&quot; retroactively that it was merely &quot;a loan&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, next time an RP guild is having some fun in an arena, and if they are like half your level or something... give the folks a break for one night out of the year and don't fuck with them. Or if you want to pick on someone your own size, gimme a tell. Being an ex Order of Magus Tytalus member, I would have loved to don their tag again for an evening and fook some peeps up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Thirdly, if I asked my guild to help me with some quest and then took the quest item the next day and auctioned it, I'd get kicked in the nootz so bad I'd be talking a few octaves higher for the rest of my life. Bad form.<br>
<br>
From the looks of it, Seol should be glad they have his/her new toy, LoR/Eve has the old item, Seol is out of the guild, everyone would probably have a better time in the game at this point if they just cooled off and went about their business, going their own separate ways.<br>

 Bottom line is, i dunno if seol is 60 or not, but when he does and has dragonsbane and giantsbane, with his epic and manna robe and helping magister of mf or affliction kill the REAL stuff, you will think about this mistake you just made and you'll kick yourselves in the ass. <br>

If I see Seolblade cast DB or GB, I will quit EQ forever...since Seolblade is a druid.<br>

As for the joining MF, Magister or Affliction, I think they all require that invites actually show up for raids.<br>

<br>
I was a member of LoR left for personaly reasons I am not going to share publically.<br>
<br>
As for loot all going to main circle of friends.  As far as I saw loot was given to those who participated most and needed it.  I see that as reward for participation as well as a benefit to guild.  However, I found out the day i joined the loot rules and am pretty sure most if not all others were told also.  If you dont like the loot rules or other rules, dont join and if you are in I dont remember anyone forcing me to stay.<br>
<br>
As far as judging guild by a few people in it.  LoR from what I understand is a fairly new guild.  They want to do big things.  A lot of people were invited.  I didn't really consider them to picky on invites.  However, they were not slow about kicking out those who didnt belong. The only 2 people you mentioned were kicked out shortly after invite.  There were also a few more.  I can also gaurantee there isnt a guild out there without someone in it not liked by more than one person.<br>
<br>
Also regarding your PS about knowing who you real friends are.  I guess maybe you feel inadiquate.  Maybe cause you sit LFG forever while these people dont, or you might feel like you are almost half a tank with few benefits to group.  The two people you mentioned one being good for clarity/haste the other being good for rez.  Maybe they do get invites to groups for those reasons.  They prolly arent the first choice though.  Personally, I dont look for a cleric who can rez good when I am groupping.  I guess we all have our preferences though.  People are noticed for how they play thier class.  Most who play classes well will prolly get groups faster.<br>

Kicking him out of the guild is supposed to be his punishment for being a loot whore, by stealing his Writ you have proven that you are all on the same level as him.  The situation may be different if he had gotten the Writ while raiding with your guild, but it obviously did not happen that way since he only attended one raid while he was in your guild.<br>
<br>
  The right way to handle this would be to give him his item back and be done with him.  Any other course of action will only make your guild look like a bunch of hypocrites.<br>

<br>
What I did there was on my time, not LoR's -- had it been an entire guild of LoR sweeping into the arena to obliterate people that would hold, however it was myself and a couple of friends who were really quite bored and thought it'd be fun to see if the 20 some odd people ranging in levels upto mid 50's could take down our little assault.  Could we have been more tactful, sure, did it &quot;ruin&quot; their event?  I doubt it, they res'd rebuffed and continued on.<br>
<br>
So Kerna.. another LoR misdead it was not, a Ninnin misdead perhaps, but hell I'm a dark elf I'm supposed to be an evil little bastard -- and incidentally I Rp'd the shit outta it.  All the out of character comments by the people there were promptly returned with witty RP retorts.<br>

LoR and Eve - Give back the darn book!  it doesn't matter if you thought it was a gift, he clearly did not, and you can always get Better.  You're a GUILD for gods sake!  he's one lousy person!  (and after this mud fest likely to stay one person.)<br>
<br>
About the shield - he didn't say he was selling it - you didn't ask either.  You made an assumption, your loss.  Again, YOU'RE A FREAKIN GUILD!!  If it matters that much to you GO AND GET ANOTHER ONE!  For crying out loud, pack of bullies ... he may have been one wanker, but you are a whole flock of 'em.<br>
<br>
you didn't like what he did and kicked him out - that's appropriate.  <br>
