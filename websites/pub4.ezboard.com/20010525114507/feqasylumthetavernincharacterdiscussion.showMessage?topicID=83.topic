The warrior watched the passage of the host silently from the trees, their numbers seemingly endless. The column stretched for miles, as the Dark Elves marched to meet their allies the Crushbone orcs before the assault upon Kelethin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Elves, Ogres, Trolls, Goblins even the distant Ry’Gorr orcs, all were represented in this moving host of darkness, an army of this size heretofore unknown in the history of Norrath. It appeared that the Dark Elves had decided the time had come to put an end to their light brethren once and for all.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mordi sat motionless high in the branches of the Faydark forest, grateful for the gentle instruction from his friends Sheaker and Sophia in the ways of Tunare’s domain. Finally as dawn began to approach, the last remnants of the army passed his hiding place. Giving the stragglers a good hour to get beyond him, Mordi dropped heavily from the tree, stretching cramped and aching muscles before jogging off into the coming morning.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was no way the elves could stand against the amassed might of the dark forces, their numbers had never been large by comparison to the more populous of Norrath’s races. Mordi predicted that when the Dark Elves and their allies marched on Kelethin they would find it abandoned for the relative safety of Felwithe’s gates. The trees were never meant to be able to withstand an assault of this magnitude, then again Felwithe wasn’t either, but it stood at least a chance of holding till aid arrived.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mordi glanced at the wreckage left by the army as he jogged through the Butcherblock Mountains; entire towns wiped out, rape, pillage, murder, all apparent in abundance. As Mordi approached the small farm where he had hoped to purchase provisions, a horrific sight greeted his eyes.<br>
In front of their humble cottage, the 4 members of the dwarven family were crucified. Nailed up on crosses, nails driven through their wrists, ankles and eyes, the tongues pulled out and cut off, their stomachs disemboweled. <br>
Mordi’s eyes began to haze over in that berserk-rage, the sign of a born warrior, desperate to attack the one’s who would do such as this, he began almost unconsciously to double back, ready to attack the host in a righteous fury. Slowly sanity returned as Mordi strained to remember his mission. He would do the Elves no good by failing to bring aid.<br>
Gently he removed the farmer, his wife and children, scratching out shallow graves for them, the delay to his mission was costly, but his conscience would not let him leave the peaceful dwarves so cruelly treated.<br>
<br>
Days passed as Mordi traveled to his homeland, stopping at both Kaladim and Freeport. The words ‘Dark Elfves had lit the fires within the dwarven people, their king promising all possible aid, even though relations between the elven and dwarven peoples were cool at times, strained at others. The Paladins and clerics of North Freeport too, had promised all aid available. The Militia who controlled East and West Freeport had been less helpful, seeming to almost relish the imminent downfall of the oft-times arrogant High Elves. Mordi thanked the Tribunal that his weapons had been removed before his meeting with the Captain of the militia; lest he forget his messenger status and slay the arrogant Captain.<br>
<br>
Several days later, as Mordi traveled through the dangerous Kithicore Woods, on his way to talk to the Mayor of Rivervale.  A terror-filled scream split the air. Mordi froze, honing in on the direction of the cry then set off at a furious pace, dodging trees, ducking beneath branches as he freed his weapons, his mind calculating the possible dangers to be found.<br>
Suddenly he burst free into a large clearing. A young human ranger was hanging from a branch, her arms tied above her head, and her feet attached to the trunk of the tree by rope. 3 Dark Elves were commenting on a 4th’s torture technique as he applied hot coals and irons to the helpless girl’s body. 3 Ogre warriors and a troll shaman sat around drinking and laughing at the commentary.<br>
Mordi never checked his pace, caution thrown to the wind. A thrown dagger sliced the rope tying the girls arms to the branch, as she fell forward onto her torturer, their heads banging together and rendering her unconscious. Mordi’s Lamentation sang with the cry for the dead that gave it it’s name, as it swung easily through the thin neck of a second elf and his Sword Breaker rang as he drew it into his right hand from the sheath on his back.<br>
The creatures were slow to react to the surprise attack and a second elf was dead before the rest roused to action. Mordi let loose his battle cry, exultant as he finally found release in battle, these deserter’s would pay the price for the evil Mordi had been forced to witness. Mordi spun, kicking out at the first Ogre Warrior, throwing him off-balance and catching the second’s powerful two-handed blow on his sword breaker, twisting the weapon as his arm gave way beneath the powerful stroke, pulling the Felhammer from the strong troll. The Lamentation sang once again as the point swung across the throat of the disarmed troll, blood fountaining from it’s throat as it staggered back and fell to the ground, it’s eyes wide with disbelief.<br>
As Mordi advanced on the third troll, he felt a fiery pain course through his back, the third elf had planted it’s dagger in his back, finding the gap between his armour and opening a ragged hole in his mail undershirt.  Blood flowed freely as Mordi pivoted and kicked backwards, catching the slender Elven rogue full in the face and throwing him across the clearing, where he laid against a tree, stunned. As Mordi turned back to the troll, he felt a stinging pain as a blade sliced into his arm, where the powerful ogre had driven his Bloodpoint dagger through the plate armour.<br>
As pain began to slow his reactions, Mordi ducked and drove his shoulder into the gut of the ogre, knocking him over and leaving him lying on the ground, momentarily stunned.<br>
He leapt forward, striving to reach the Elf who had been torturing the ranger. As the elf began to murmur mystic words over some bones thrown on the ground. A Necromancer! Mordi realised in horror. The realisation of his imminent death came upon him, and Mordi mourned the failure of his mission.  As Mordi ran towards the necromancer, he was thrown forward and sideways as an ogre launched itself at Mordi, bringing him to the ground.<br>
The two warriors rolled apart and came to their feet, the ogre between Mordi and the necromancer. Determined to sell his life dearly, Mordi charged the larger warrior. The two met in a flurry of blows, both skilled warriors, wielding a weapon in either hand. Finally Mordi gained the upper hand, throwing his head forward, to head-butt the ogre, stunning and confusing the creature. But, as Mordi readied to dispatch him, his body arched with agony as he felt poison course along his veins. The shaman! He had forgotten and was now paying the price; it had backed out of the warrior’s sight and into the trees. The pain was immense and Mordi collapsed, managing to bring his blade down and through the Ogre’s heart even as he did so.<br>
Mordi strained to regain his feet as the necromancer finished his incantation, the bones reforming themselves into a living skeleton. The third warrior sauntered over, confident of his ability to kill the struggling barbarian. Mordi stared at his approaching doom, cursing fate, knowing that when he stood before The Tribunal to be judged, he would be deemed unworthy. This had not been his fight, his mission was too critical to allow one human’s fate to delay it.<br>
As Mordi struggled to rise from his knees, his weapons falling from now nerveless fingers, he stared up at the ogre as it raised its blade for the killing stroke. Mordi silently prayed to Rallos Zek to allow him a warrior’s death, on his feet and fighting.<br>
A berserker’s howl erupted from his lips as he felt the spirit of the god infuse him with the berserker’s rage, gift of Rallos Zek to the true warriors of Norrath.  Mordi’s fist drove upwards into the crotch of the ogre, the creature crying out in pain as Mordi moved his head from the path of the blade, catching it on his shoulder, where it sheared through armour and cut deep into his shoulder, splintering the bone.<br>
Mordi felt no pain, his failing body a distant thing. He surged to his feet, catching the ogre by throat and crotch, launching it at the necromancer with his incredible berserker’s strength, sending them both to the ground. The necromancer’s pet fell to pieces, attesting to the death of the dark magician. Mordi dived and rolled to the side, snatching his other dagger from his belt as the now revived rogue charged at him.<br>
A blast of frozen ice slammed into him. Shards of deadly ice finding it’s way through his armour, cutting him in dozens of places,  causing Mordi to stagger as he regained his feet. Using the last of his failing energies, Mordi charged and threw himself at the evil grin of the troll. Taken by surprise by this desperate measure, the troll dodged, but too late. Mordi’s weight carried them both to the ground. As he raised his dagger to end the troll’s life, he felt his legs collapse as the rogue’s thrown blade severed his spinal cord.<br>
An animal cry of pain and rage escaped Mordi’s lips, shattering the relative peace of the forest, causing birds to take flight and animals to flee, as he collapsed forward, his dagger driving through the troll’s throat.  The light in the great warrior’s eyes dying as his body rolled off the troll.<br>
<br>
An hour or two later a ranger entered the clearing, his eyes opening wide at the carnage before him. He saw immediately in front of him, two dead elves, one’s head severed from it’s body, the second with a gaping wound in the side of its neck, an ogre was dead nearby too. As he continued to look around the clearing, he saw a second ogre, a Lamentation driven all the way through its body.  A faint sound caught his attention from the other side of a tree. Drawing his Ykesha’s he advanced slowly around the tree.<br>
<br>
‘Astara!’ he exclaimed as he recognised the young ranger in front of him.<br>
‘Oh, thank the gods Ranalin! I was so scared they had come back and were going to finish me off.’ She almost sobbed with relief. ‘Please, help me get free.’<br>
Ranalin saw that the girl’s hands were securely tied as were her feet, in fact the rope tying her feet was also tied to the tree, accounting for the reason she was still there.<br>
‘What happened Astara?’ enquired Ranalin as he began to free the girl. ‘I saw the 2 elves and the ogre in the clearing. Where did they come from, who killed them, and why did they not release you?’<br>
‘I… I don’t know.’ Stammered the girl. ‘I was walking through the forest, practicing tracking the local animals, when they captured me. There were 4 elves, 3 ogres and a troll, I had no idea they were there, I think one of the elves was a sorcerer of some sort and had cloaked them.  They took me back here and they…they, hurt me.’  Astara’s eyes began to widen as she remembered her terrible ordeal.<br>
‘Hush there young one, no need to dwell on it. Did a band of our halfling friends come upon them and attack? I noticed only the evil one’s bodies… surely it must have been a strong patrol to walk away with no casualties.’ Ranalin asked as he began to rub her wrists and ankles to restore the blood flow.<br>
‘I only saw one man, he was a barbarian warrior, he charged the clearing out of nowhere.  He threw a dagger that cut the rope that was holding me up and then started killing them. I blacked out when my head struck the head of the elf torturing me, but he was a terrible sight. He wore a cold smile, his eyes alight with joy at the prospect of battle… that’s all I saw.’<br>
‘Surely there were others?’<br>
‘I saw nobody, but I was unconscious for a long time, when I awoke there was just the bodies and no-one to be seen. I crawled around to this side of the tree and tried to hide and free myself.’<br>
‘I’d best have a scout around then little one, make sure that there is no-one around.’ Ranalin sensed a wolf standing nearby and called it to him. His magic allowed him to plant a message in its mind for Jaynin, to bring himself and a few other rangers to secure the area and to escort Astara home.<br>
As Ranalin returned to the clearing he noticed on the far side a pile of bones.  As he neared the pile, he recognised them as a collapsed skeleton and not far away, under the eaves of the trees he spied a large ogre, lying sprawled on top of what he presumed to be the necromancer responsible for the raising of the dead. Ranalin rolled the ogre over and inspected the corpse. From the looks of it the Ogre had broken a rib which pierced its lung when he hit the Elf, causing him to drown in his own blood. The necromancer’s neck was broken, no doubt from the ogre. A few metres away a Sword Breaker lay on the ground, covered with dried blood. As Ranalin crouched next to the blade a glint of sunlight on metal caught his eye. As he hurried over to investigate he saw two bodies lying several metres away from the clearing.<br>
The closer one was a troll shaman, a dagger protruding from its throat and an evil grin still plastered on its dead face. Lying next to him was Astara’s saviour. The man was clearly an experienced warrior, one who had survived too long to be prone to this sort of encounter. A warrior who lived to his age was a cautious one, who knew when and where to fight. Something had driven this man to attack without heed of numbers. His armour was bloody and rent, his shoulder crushed, his spinal cord severed from a well placed dagger, still protruding from his back and another large hole showed that one of his opponents at least had lacked the honour to attack this mighty foe to his face. A slit throat attested to the fact that at least one of the survivers had wanted to make very sure that he was dead, though from the lack of blood, Ranalin judged the man had been dead before the act had taken place.<br>
As Ranalin mourned the loss of this unknown man, a thought occurred to him... was it too late?<br>
‘Astara!’ he called.<br>
‘Yes Ranalin?’ Replied the girl as she came close. ‘Oh that’s him! They, they killed him.’<br>
‘Yes they did young one. Now I must leave you alone here with him. Jaynin will be here soon with some of our fellow rangers, but I must be off to Rivervale to see if any of their clerics can help this man. Can you be brave and keep the scavengers from him until they get here?’<br>
The girl looked at the man who had saved her life, then back up at Ranalin.<br>
‘Yes, I can and I will Ranalin.’ She said as she yanked the dagger from the throat as the troll, holding it tightly before her.<br>
Ranalin nodded, impressed by her strength of character, then, calling upon Tunare to aid him in his need, he set off for Rivervale at a run, the spirit of the wolf infusing him with increased speed and stamina.<br>
<br>
In a distant plane of reality, the spirit that had been Mordi stood before the three beings known to the creatures of Norrath as The Tribunal.<br>
‘You abandoned your mission Mordi.’ Stated the first of the beings. ‘Due to your lack of dedication, the elves of Felwithe and Kelethin will in all likelihood be destroyed to a man. And no doubt their dwarven and human allies as well. What do you have to say for yourself?’<br>
Mordi made no comment.<br>
‘No excuses Mordi? Surely you have an argument for doing what you did.’<br>
‘No Milord. I abandoned my duty. There is no excuse for that.’<br>
‘Well Mordi. Despite the manner in which you died, you have led a good life. You have always pledged yourself to what you believed to be good and never strayed from your word before this incident.  Therefore it is the ruling of The Tribunal that you may proceed to the afterlife and join your brethren.’<br>
Mordi stood stunned, lost for words. A look of joy on his face, slowly replaced by one of stony resolution.<br>
 ‘My lords I cannot accept this. I am unworthy.  How could I feast and spar with my fallen brothers after such a cataclysmic failure? It would be, perhaps, forgivable in a younger warrior, but I knew better. I am sorry my Lords, but I cannot accept your generous ruling.  My honour will not allow it.’<br>
‘Well Mordi, there is one other option.’ Said one of the other beings ‘Even now a cleric is hurrying to resurrect you. Unfortunately your corpse is past the point where you can be recalled to the world by normal clerical means. The damage done to your body was too severe. The poison from the shaman dissolved many of your veins and arteries. Not to mention the sheer physical damage done to you. However, if you so wish, we will enable the cleric to resurrect you so that you may try to fulfil your pledge. Be aware however, that if you should fail to bring salvation to the Elves a second time, you will not be allowed to join your brethren. Do you accept?’<br>
Mordi looked up at the central figure before him, staring at those knowing eyes, and realised there was no need to reply.  They already knew the answer.<br>
‘Very well Mordi. Be aware you are now solely responsible for the saving of the elven peoples. Do not fail them a second time.’ Said the being, then it chuckled ‘We wish you luck, though Bristlebane may have words with us for poaching on his preserve.’ <br>
<br>
Back in the forest, Shariana the halfling high priestess looked up at Ranalin, her eyes telling him all he needed to know.<br>
‘Are you sure Lady?’ he asked. ‘Surely one of your skills… he has not been dead more than two hours.’<br>
‘Normally I would be able to resurrect him, it’s true Ranalin. But the internal damage is even more overwhelming than the external. No mortal could heal that kind of damage, his veins and arteries are nearly all destroyed by the shaman’s spells. Even if I somehow managed to get his spirit back here, his body would die again within mo…’<br>
‘Within mo… what?’  Asked Ranalin ‘I can’t believe that such a noble act could be so cruelly repaid.’<br>
Ranalin noticed the strange look on Shariana’s face.<br>
‘Are you ok?’ he asked, a note of worry creeping into his voice.<br>
‘I… I am fine Ranalin, I just had a… visitation. I have been asked to resurrect this man, from a power higher than either of us. I say asked? No, I should say I was told that I would resurrect him. I will need you and your fellow rangers to stand guard. This will be a long struggle.’<br>
