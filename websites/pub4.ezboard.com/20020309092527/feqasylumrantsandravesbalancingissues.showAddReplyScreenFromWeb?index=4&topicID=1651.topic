(keep in mind we have block scheduling, so I only had three classes, and about 40 students.....they had five days to do 21 problems).<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is how students think:  <br>
<br>
Twenty problems! WOW that's A LOT of work....what will happen if I don't do it?  Oh, I'll just get a zero.  That's not big deal.<br>
<br>
Make the consequence a bid deal and miraculously you have results.<br>
<br>
<br>
I find it pathetic I have to hold my students for lunch detention just to get them to do their homework.  The entire 9th grade team had to do this because 50% of our students were flat out failing because they weren't doing homework.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't agree with striking a student for believing differently, but I do belive there have to be some kind of consequences for their actions.  <br>

There are alot of ways to get across to a person what they are doing is wrong. Discipline takes time and effort, hitting will get you the desired effect momentarily, but what about the long run? We have a pretty violent society as it is.<br>
<br>
Most schools have &quot;in-school-suspension&quot; where they are made to do school work all day. If out-of-school suspension and they are happy, apparently there is no punishment at home. Punishment dosent have to be spanking. Every person, including children have things they love and love to do. You can take those things away, you can also request the school send home a ton of school work,there are chores enough at home to keep em busy for weeks.<br>
<br>
I know people who were spanked growing up and kids who werent. The results are mixed. Some of the spanked kids are in jail now, and some are very successful. I know kids who were NOT spanked as kids, again it is a mixed bag, some are in jail and some are very successful. This tells me spanking is no garantee that your child will learn the lessons of life any better due to spankings.<br>
<br>
Society is violent enough. How do you teach a child hitting someone who says somthing they dont like is wrong if you hit them for saying the wrong thing? Dont kids learn how to handle things by watching how we handle things?<br>
<br>
Personally I think most would be surprised to find how many kids are spanked. It is more common than not I think. I dont think kids are misbehaving cause they dont get spanked. Plenty of kids ARE getting spanked and are also misbehaving alot. What do you do with those kids?<br>
<br>
Also, it is true, I have NO RIGHT to tell another parent how to raise their child. If they believe in spanking, it is NONE of my business. It is not up to me to say a dam thing to them. In that same thought, it is NOT the right of the school to hit my child since I dont raise him that way. So NOOOO I dont believe in giving the school the right to hit my kid. I would advocate the schools right to expel the student who is a disciplinary problem and the state MAKING the parent responsible to home school and the parent subject to criminal liablity if the child is not home-schooled. It is my understanding that kids who are home schooled have to show this in lessons to some educational authority.<br>
<br>
/sigh I know I will get bashed pretty bad for believing as I do...but it works for me.<br>
<br>
Before everyone gets into examples of individuals who werent spanked and turned out horribly, keep in mind there are plenty of examples of kids who were spanked and turned out horribly also. If we do want to go there... then look at swedens crime rate, and the fact that hitting your children is ILLEGAL. Personally I think it is not just that spanking is illegal that makes their crime rate lower etc, I think there are lots of other factors involved most likely.<br>

<br>
When bad parenting results in children who are disfunctional, disobedient, and prone to violent or criminal acts, it BECOMES our business.<br>
<br>
I agree with corporal punishment under many circumstances, but I really think some more studies have to be done on what affect physical discipline has on children. Anecdotal accounts like &quot;my dad kicked the shit out of me every afternoon since I was six and now I'm the CEO of Microsoft&quot; prove nothing. <p><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81496">Dolalin</a> Bonewielder<br>

<br>
Me and school have an arrangement.  My kids are bad in school they must go to the office an phone mom.  Now this can't work in every situation.  People work and such and this wouldn't work in that situation.  However my kids know(actually just my oldest atm) that if they phone mom from the office....good bye computer, tv and gameboy type stuffs and they are gonna be doing chores after school instead after homework is done.   I think they can do without their "stuff" but hate having to vacuum and dust and do dishes etc.  I think if it got bad enough they'd be picking up the dog poop outside.   No tolerance here.<br>
<br>
So what to do with the kids who's parents don't care?   Yes there are alot.  Kid next door calls his mom a ...err ...the b word.   She does nothing.   I have no idea who then steps in and corrects this type of behavior.   Leaving it to the school seems like a cop out but what will happen to this child otherwise?<br>
<br>
I recall the strap in gradeschool and boy when someone got sent to the office and the doors to classrooms were open you could here that strap falling down on whomever's hands it was hitting.  It was a bit of a detterrent for most of us.  But i would not want my son to have to go thru that when effectively i can deal with him alot better.   So what do you do then?  Do you give the parent a chance to straighten out johnny or do you whip out that strap?<br>

<br>
in my sons school, the PARENTS are responsible for the homework. each night i have to sign his homework paper.. if a chilid is not turning in homework, the parent is brought in. <br>
<br>
the parents get upset because they are missing work for this meeting, the school is upset because the child is not doing his/her homework, and in the end, to avoid another meeting, the child seems to get his homework done with the parents sig on top. <br>
<br>
as for the stiking a child in the face.. NO, there is a much better way, there should never be a time when you feel the need to strike your child in the face. don't get me wrong, my children have gotten a spankin, on the rear. but only in sever cases.<br>
<br>
also, the timeline for a spanking is a lil one... you cant give one to a two year old, they can barely comprehend what is right and what is wrong. the parents job is to teach this, not to punish it. <br>
<br>
at 7, you cant spank a kid for not doing his homework.. its called ground them, no goin out, no sleepovers, take away a gameboy...or do the unthinkable, no video games or tv!<br>
<br>
like i said, it all depends on the surcumstance of each incident...but 99/100 times, usually there is a better way.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ujellah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jellah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/5/02 6:56:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this something WE need to do in our Schools?</span><hr size=1> Spanking is legal, I have no right to force my moral judgements on anyone. Abuse is illegal, if I saw that I would report that to the authorities.<br>
<br>
I think spanking does more harm than good, but that is my opinion, not the law. I dont get to tell others how to parent based on my opinions. My opinions and morals are my own, I dont think I should offer them to total strangers un-invited. I would like to see studies done on this though. I suspect it has an ill effect on society, BUT that is an opinion and a belief I hold. My opinions dont make law, I am not the end all for &quot;right and wrong&quot;. I hold no degree in child psychology, I have conducted no study on this. I am simply a parent of one child who is 10, I have not spanked him and will not spank him. That is my parental choice. <br>
<br>
People doing legal things that I disagree with is none of my business. It isnt my right to enforce my opinions on someone elses behavior.<br>

So this one day she had a sub come in for the morning and I spend the entire morning with about four other kids talking instead of paying attention.<br>
<br>
When the sub gave her behavior report, Mrs. Troxler hauled me and my accomplices out into the hall for a good lashing. Being the ring leader I went first and she beat the shoe polish outta me. God damn that hurt.<br>
<br>
So, in pain, I go back into class while she lets the other boys have their turn with the paddle. I sit down in my chair and the entire class, most of whom had never been spanked in school, asks me if it hurt...<br>
<br>
Too wounded to think clearly, I say: Hell no!! That didn't hurt!!<br>
at the exact INSTANT she walked back through the door.....<br>

I dont remember much about the second spanking and that was the last time I ever was punished in school.<br>

Lets drop the issue of corporal punishment for a moment and just look at the issue of getting the parents into the schools. If you ask any public school teacher they will tell you that getting parents to show up during school hours to deal with their child is like pulling teeth. For example, my mom teaches elementary school and nearly every year there are 2 or 3 parents who can't be bothered to show up to the school for parent/teacher conferances and are also unwilling to try to set up an alternative time to meet, no matter how poorly their child is doing in school. These are the same parents who come to the school fuming mad at the end of the school year demanding that you not put little Johnny, their pride and joy who's perfect, into summer school or retain him for the year. <br>
<br>
Obviously, there needs to be some changes, but it is both difficult and unpopular to enforce parenting skills. Instead, we have a society that uses the electronic babysitter and has teachers who are expected to not only teach reading and writing, but morals to little Johnny as well. Oh, and the teachers usually have to be mindreaders as well since the parent's don't both telling them what morals are supposed to be taught either.<br>
<br>
Personally, I find it interesting that countries like Germany actually recognize being a stay at home mother as a profession and provide a token salary ($300/month if I remember correctly) to help support this decision. Should we be surprized that their percentage of crimes by youths are less?<br>

<br>
<br>
Anyone that is too fucking weak to deal with a 6 year old, that feels the need to smack them is sad.<br>
<br>
SAD<br>
<br>
Trust me, hitting your children doesnt do shit. In most cases it plants seeds of hate. It seperates you from your child in ways you wont see till your kids are in there 30's.<br>
<br>
Abusing kids = bad. <p><img src=http://www.infotekk.com/nalgene.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unalgene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nalgene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/5/02 10:30:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1651.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is this something WE need to do in our Schools?</span><hr size=1> I actually despise people that hit there kids. It really fucking pisses me off (because of my early childhood)<br>
<br>
I was in a store once and this 260 lb fat ass smack his little kid really hard.  So I walked up to him and asked him if he wanted to me to smack his ass around the store like a little bitch in front of everyone that was watching.  Needless to say the guy shut his fucking mouth and ran out of the store.<br>
<br>
You cant tollerate this shit today at all. Violence doesnt solve anything. It might be the best quick fix. But in the long run it doesnt do a god damn thing. <p><img src=http://www.infotekk.com/nalgene.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues>Rants and Raves </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
