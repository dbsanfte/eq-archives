<br>
Tuan, you just may as well give up talking with the likes of Cendan. They are not reachable. You can reason with them, flame them, do whatever, and they are unyielding. Such people have lost all reason. They wear blinders as a protective measure. They are trying to shield their frail lives with a very calculating black and white world. They can't see just how brittle their lives are; ready to break under stress at a moment.<br>
<br>
I have met people in RL just like what Cendan protrays here. The people I met were very frightened of themselves. If the world was not &quot;cut and dry&quot;, if God's declarations were not crisp and clear, they fell apart and fed into their dark sides.<br>
<br>
I realized after my small flame fest with Cendan that I can't really blame him for what he is. I can respect the fact that his strength flows through the negativity of legalism. He has lived with it long enough now that he doesn't even notice the negative impact on others who don't follow his brand of Christianity. However, that is all that keeps him psychologically sound for the time being.<br>
<br>
Maybe someday Cendan will get to see the various colors in life. It will not be just black and white. Maybe, given time and experience, he will see the beauty in people. <br>
<br>
Well, the best we can do is hope for ourselves and not get trapped into legalism. As an atheist I am trying to keep an open mind. I understand that I could very well be wrong. Indeed, I at times hope that I am. I think reincarnation would be wonderful. Going to &quot;Heaven&quot; might even be great with the right deity.<br>
<br>
Cendan, I am not trying to bash you more. I sincerely apologize for flaming you earlier. I am sincere in my remarks above. I realized once I had made my last posting you are probably a person who is just in need of a lot of love and understanding. Nothing wrong with that. We all need love and understanding. We all need it more at times than others. But I can tell you from experience that drawing hard lines will only chase away people. Sure you can believe it, but you don't have to wield your beliefs like a sword. You only find people like me who will oblige and cut back. That makes life even more stressful and hurtfull. You get into a viscious circle and become even more legalistic, black and white, and cut off so many people. One day, you look upon your life with no friends, no family, and wonder why God can't give you a little heaven on earth. Just my thoughts bro, take care.<br>

<br>
Like I said, you either believe in God and follow His word, or you don't believe in him.  Now, I am not going to make assumptions so please tell me what category you fall into.<br>
<br>
You sound as if you accept God but only on your terms, and that just doesn't work.  Are you athiest or a believer?<br>
<br>
Just so you know that I am not avoiding the question I will remind you that the Apostle Paul when he was Saul was a devout folloewr of God.  He killed Christians thinking they were blasphemers, thinking he was a perfect Jew.  Jesus came to him and educated him in a rather scary way.  Paul, formerly Saul, was not a Christian with the Holy Spirit until he was baptised.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lurikeen,<br>
<br>
You said you had nothing more to say to me, which is where you should leave it.  You say you apologize and then try to paint a picture of me as some loser with no love.<br>
<br>
You can't imagine how wonderful my wife is, you just can't.  You can't imagine how dependable and loving my parents have been.  You wouldn't understand that I have a great relationship with my wife's parents, and all her friends.  You might be surprised that I am friends with all my ex girlfriends, and my wife has met and hung out with several.  My wife and I have eaten at the parents house of an ex, while the ex was off at college.  I assure you I have all the relationships I need.  I am very loved, too loved if you ask me, cause I am a slip through the cracks kind of guy when I can get away with it.<br>
<br>
I dont appreciate your snide remarks hidden in the guise of sympathy.  Keep your sympathy, apparently you are the only one who thinks I need it.<br>
<br>
Now I can understand you saying I wear blinders because I won't convert to your Athiesm.  Because I say that some issues are black and white you state that my life is.  Come on now, don't stoop.<br>
<br>
I am a stressed fragile person right.  Ask anyone who knows me in game, ask anyone who knows me in life, ask anyone who I vacationed with that I met from in game.  You can't get me down, I am very stable and very secure.  I am aware of my strengths and my weaknesses.  I am not frightened of myself.<br>
<br>
My strength flows through the negativity of legalism.  Um, okay.  I am happy to be saved and trying to spread the good news to others but I am a negative person.  Yup, thats me.<br>
<br>
Which is it?  Do I have on blinders in happy ignorance or do I see things and live in this dark world of doubt?  As far as my impact on others who hear me... believe the Bible discusses the popularity of the message.  So you think I should water it down like most people do?  Try to make it more acceptable and convienient?  I would rather be a zealot then a sell out.<br>
<br>
Me see the beauty in people?  You won't find many people who spend more time helping others.  I wont mention names and embarass anyone but lots of people in game have told me their troubles and I have listened, and given advice.  I never mentioned the Bible once, I think its out of line to push that on people in game.  I reply to theads on the subject here, but I see nothing wrong with that.  I have even got private messages asking for prayers.  Its a pity you choose to see me as some legalistic person with no love.<br>
<br>
Dont be an ass and talk to me by talking about me.  Either talk to me or move on like you said you were.<br>
<br>
I hope you don't consider yourself an amateur psychologist, because you couldn't read me if you had my personal journal memorized.<br>
<br>
You claim to be some educated exegetical wonder.  If you apply the same skill to what I write as you did to your Koine Greek then you might want to go back over it.<br>
<br>
I apologize for any assumptions I made about you.  I do respect your intelligence but you really need work on your people skills.  You have spent almost every post assuming things about me that aren't even close, and stating them as if they are fact. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

I decided to go ahead and address you directly with my sincere thoughts. But, being the rabid jerk you are you decided to even flame me there.<br>
<br>
You should also note that in my posting I qualified my remarks with "I have met people in RL just like what Cendan protrays here." I wonder what part of "portray" you didn't understand? You certainly have every right to challenge the way you are percieved. Some people actually write things like "I am sorry if I come across that way..." or "I apologize". Of course, you have probably never mouthed such phrases let alone try to write them.<br>
<br>
At any rate you fuck tard. I recant any apology I sincerely made to your stupid ass. You aren't worthy of worm shit. Do the world a favor and arrange to meet your Lord ASAP. I am only happy that rigid nutless wonders like yourself are few a far between.<br>
<br>
/rude<br>
<br>
BTW, the reason why the Gates in Heaven are called the "Pearly Gates" is because of all the giz Jesus spews out as people such his cock to get into heaven. They don't call them the "Pearly Gates" for nothing.<br>

<br>
I have no problem apologizing at all.  Fact is, though, that I am not sorry I came across that way, because I did not come across that way, you looked for it... and not finding it you invented it.<br>
<br>
If I was you I would stick to pretending God doesn't exist rather than making Him the subject of your jokes.  I can't think of any thing He hates more than blasphemy.<br>
<br>
The problem is that you are smart.  You aren't stupid.  If you were stupid I would have let your comments pass and accepted your backwards apology.  You knew very well what you were doing.<br>
<br>
Just curious, using your reasoning is "you are acting like an ass" not an insult because its better than "you are an ass"?<br>
<br>
Regardless, I apologize for responding in kind, and for letting you upset me.  I could have found a more constructive way to defend myself.  Its isn't just the way that you made me look, its the fact that you made it seem like that image was a product of a Godly life.<br>
<br>
I also apologize that I let the tone of my responses be influenced by the fact that lots of what you said and asked is typical.  The same questions asked over and over get on anybody's nerves.  The same statements that tend to be sterotypical also tend to get on my nervers.  Things like "Christians are weakminded" or "Christians have blinders on" are easy to provoke anger.  One that makes me more angry than anything is the accusation that Christians enjoy condemning people.  <br>
<br>
In all honesty true Christians, on average, have done more research than most religious people because at first they would love to find loop-holes to such a strict requirement.  Plus, given the requirements, they look to find a way that their friends, co-workers, and even some family could be saved despite what the Bible says.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have no right to be angry at you for a typical response when all you were giving was a natural response.  Not your fault that people before you have given the same stereotypical response.  Don't know if I am being clear here or not, tried several times to make the wording better... oh well.<br>
<br>
I have a lot of faults, but sincerity isn't one of them.  If I misjudged your intentions then I do truly apologize.  I just don't see any other way you could have meant things you said. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

I think where you come across wrong to other folks is you actually think you know what God is oging to do, what He is thinking, what makes Him angry, and how He is supposed to be reached. Sorry, you don't. No one does. In Christain writings we are shown a path to reach our relationship with God. Note, I said PATH not connect the dots. this path was written by people searching for spirituality, faith and a realtionship with God. It records the words fo the Son of God. Men can fail, and thus these writings are not perfect, not to be taken as the ONLY way to reach God. I would submit that they should be taken as a GUIDE to achieve a realtionship with God to help build your faith in God.<br>

<br>
First of all I don't consider it &quot;my terms&quot; the way you do.  The Bible are peoples interpretation of events, plain and simple that is how I see it.  Some stories are made up and/or exagerated to express certain points.  I am to logical to believe otherwise, so this isn't worth arguing.  There is honestly nothing you can say to prove to me or any one those events happened.  The simple conclusion is, many events were exagerated stories to prove moral and ethical points.<br>
<br>
I am not making up &quot;terms&quot; here to accept God.  YOU call them making up terms based on your belief of what God is.  I think your view is flawed, as I showed rather thoroghly in my last post I thought.  My view may be as flawed as anyone, how do I really know? This is why I have such a changing view on the matter. As I learn new things or hear new arguments, my mind changes.<br>
<br>
(btw the rest when I say &quot;you&quot;, I mean to everyone in general, not directed at you Cendan)<br>
<br>
The Bible is a set of guidelines.<br>
<br>
The reason to follow these guildelines? It's not to get to heaven nor to avert hell.  It is to live a life of love with everyone around you.  To respect people and treat them as you wish to be treated.  I live my life for now, not for some so called afterlife.  If there is an afterlife? I don't worry about that, because I am confident that I am living my life the right way and there isn't anyone I know that would disagree with me.  If there is some heaven afterlife? Then I guess I will find out for sure when I get there.<br>
<br>
I believe the Bible is a valuable tool to set our morals on, full of stories that should be taught to encourage people to understand that THIS IS the way they should live.  No matter who they are, everyone should understand that these morals are a basis for all of mankind, anyone of all faiths.<br>
<br>
That is what the Bible is to me.<br>
<br>
You see, to me it doesn't really even matter if God exists to explain how people should live, it just doesn't matter.  If you(general) are living your life to gain points with God or think the only reason to follow the morals set by the Bible are to get into heaven- then you won't get there.<br>
<br>
&quot;you either believe in God and follow His word, or you don't believe in him&quot;<br>
<br>
I am following God's word to what he means to me from reading the Bible.  You may say that there is only 1 true interpretation and to believe anything else is wrong, well, that may be true.  But if that's the case- no one has discovered the &quot;one true&quot; inupretation yet.<br>
<br>
Now, bear with me on the argument I posted last post.  Your quotation of scripture does not really answer what I was asking.<br>
<br>
In this argument, tell me what you don't agree with.<br>
<br>
Premise 1. It is clear that in actuality God does not treat people unfairly.<br>
Premise 2. If He does treat people unfairly, then all discussions about God would be completely irrelivent.<br>
Premise 3. Your version of God is He is strict to the letter on actions, even when the &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; is in the right place. (i.e. being baptized a different way) <br>
Premise 4. Being strict to the letter has shown to have the possiblity of yeilding unfair treatment and God cannot be unfair. (in your admiting it was unfair treatment)<br>
Conclusion. Your idea of God is flawed.<br>
<br>
I'm really wondering what you saw wrong with this.  It makes perfect sense.  Preaching a God that treats people unfairly doesn't make any sense. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utuan00dorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuan00Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1086<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/8/02 3:14:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=187>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> sorry if the last post is incoherant, kept going back and forth throughout the way while doing other stuff and editing it =o <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uablazenholysword.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ablazen Holysword</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 783<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/9/02 10:14:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=188>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Expectations and consequences of God</span><hr size=1> I will just spout my opinion for a quick second. I believe one is judged by his actions, and his beliefs. You must live a virtous life, in order to be good and just.<br>
<br>
I do not, however, believe in following a set of rules. I was brought up and atheist, and was never baptised (the only one among my family). However, i have walked through the four holy gates of Rome (which I believe are only opened once every 25 years?), I have shaken hands with the pope, and i have both whept and smiled in Bethleham and Jerusalem. I have seen the grave of Jesus Christ, and also his birthplace. I have celebrated with the pope, during both World Youth Day festivities, and Jubilee celebrations. I have tried to live a truthful, faithful, and just life. Faithful not to a supreme being, but rather to friends, family, and strangers. <br>
<br>
I believe I will go to heaven when i die. I believe anyone who is &quot;good&quot; will go to heaven. However, i do not live my life according to following a set of rules only to fulfil some prerequisites for an afterlife. I live every day to the fullest (that's why i left eq <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and try to help people in any way i can. <br>

<br>
Well Tuan, I skimmed through the thread a bit to catch up, but I just don't have much time to answer other people yet, nor that other question you asked.. however.. on this issue..<br>
<br>
I have been taught that God will judge you based upon what you DO know, not what you DON'T know. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, any baby that dies would be sent to Hell if they haven't been saved.. right??  But that isn't the case, as stated in the Bible. <br>
<br>
If you've never ever ever been given the gospel (or &quot;good news&quot;) then God will take that into account, after all He can read your heart.  <br>
<br>
If you know about the gospel and reject it, that is a completely different situation.<br>
<br>
So in this case, no the people who had never heard of God would not be sent to Hell (yes, I disagree with whomever said they would), instead they would sit in judgement by God.  <br>
<br>
I'll write more later.  Hope this was clear, but not re-reading it, so if not, I'll discuss later with you, Tuan.<br>

Romans 1:18-25 tells us "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; 19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath showed it unto them.<b> 20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</b> 21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. 24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."<br>

As far as I know, Jesus gave the commission so that the Gentiles and other people in the world would come to know that they no longer need sacrifice animals to atone for their sins, but that God loved them so much that he gave his only son to pay for their sins for all time- i.e. He was the ultimate sacrifice.  We are to go out and save souls for we are involved in spirtual warfare. <br>

<br>
<br>
As for this -<br>
<br>
You do NOT read carefully enough, Cendan.  <br>
<br>
Further, you jump to conclusions.<br>
<br>
To clarify, just in case I did not write it clearly enough - what I stated was that the people who know nothing about God will be judged on what they DO know of him.  <br>
<br>
I NEVER once said they would get into heaven.  <br>
<br>
I said they would not be sent to Hell (upon death) but would go into judgement.  <br>
<br>
1)  Key word here is JUDGED!<br>
<br>
2) They will be judged according to what they DO know.  As stated in the verse you quoted, which I do agree with.<br>
<br>
3) Remember that Romans was written by Paul in order to defend the gospel that justification was by faith alone.  The gospel at this time was being twisted and also opposed.  Two extremes that were evident were : Judaizers (those who say salvation is by grace, but believers are kept by the law) and antiomians (those who said you were saved by grace and then could live any way you wanted to - even continuing on in sin).  These are just two of the twisted preachings that Paul wanted to counter in writing this letter.<br>
<br>
I say remember this because, the verse you quoted, though I agree with you in what it says <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  was actually written regarding those present in Pauls' day that knew of Jesus, yet refused to believe, or supressed the truth, or twisted it.  Which is not the same exact situation that Tuan brought up.<br>
<br>
Actually, this is the exact verse I would have pulled out though.  Indeed, it states that God has made it known to all people, and that there is no excuse.  <br>
<br>
So what happens to those who either don't believe, refuse to believe, or never hear the gospel?  They pass into judgement.<br>
<br>
I did not say they bypass judgement, that is reserved for those that are &quot;saved.&quot;<br>
<br>
Personally though, I am a bit fuzzy whether the judgement will be the same for ALL non-believers - and I am referring to the White Throne Judgement here.  That I do not know, haven't stuided that area yet.  If that is the case, then all those in judgement will be found to be unrighteous.  I know those that reject God, will pass into the White Throne Judgement, just not sure about those who have never heard of Christ.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, Cendan...  you need to read more carefully or ask for clarification.  You jumped to an incorrect conclusion that obviously upset you (I am getting that from the obvious tone of your post). <br>
<br>
Its like the baptism post you replied to.  Somehow you received the impression that I stated baptism was not necessary, which I never said.  I said I didn't feel that was sufficient for salvation, although some churches teach that belief - I do not believe it.  I also stated that I don't feel full immersion into water is necessary, as the greek word baptisim comes from (baptizo) (sp?) which doesn't mean immersion into water, but just means immersion into something.  I even stated how the bible says things like baptized into fire, baptized by the spirit, etc., etc.  <br>
<br>
Point is, you misread and jumped to conclusions.  Sometimes, I may not be clear enough, that is true.  If you aren't postive, you should ask for clarification.<br>
<br>
<br>
I know that I may be slow in answering, but that is because I don't want to post hastily.  I know that by publicly stating I am a Christian that I am representing Christ to those that read these boards.  Even if someone disagrees with me, I want them to think &quot; Hey, she was at least well spoken and civil.&quot;  It gives more credence to my words, and maybe they will think about them, and God will work in them to a good end.  Maybe just maybe.  If not, I will at least have been a good ambassador during the time I spent on these boards.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I have spent enough time here.<br>
<br>
I must say, that in the future, if you have misread my posts , I probably won't take the time to refute what you say unless I feel its grossly incorrect.  I'll simply ask you to re-read what I wrote.  I'd rather answer some of the questions people have asked and my time is limited.  Some seem to be searching and exploring right now, and I'd love the chance to refer them to sources where they can do further research on their own before making up their minds about what they will believe.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this post came across as pleasant and non-confrontational.  I am doing my best to emote that, even in this medium.  If not, please do not take offense.  <br>

<br>
Lukaria, I am quoting you above, but not picking on you. You stated something I think many Christians should answer. That is, what does &quot;know&quot; mean in the above context?<br>
<br>
If Joe Christology knocks on my door and preaches the good news to me do I really *know* the gospel? What does *know* mean, in the case of knowing the gospel?<br>
<br>
You see, in order for me to say I have knowledge of x, it must be the case that x is true. I must believe that x is true, and I must have reasonable justification for my belief that x is true.<br>
<br>
Simply hearing or reading the Gospel as presented by Cendan, lets say, will not count as &quot;he now knows the gospel&quot;. Right?<br>
<br>
I have always thought the Soren Kierkegaard's views on Existentialism is helpful here (also Rudolph Otto's &quot;Idea of the Holy&quot;)... one can satisfy the prescription for knowing as I spell out above if they have an experience with something wholly other than themselves and it is an experience with Christ.<br>
<br>
Problem is that &quot;Christ&quot; is not just a Christian idea. It may be there is a universal experience of &quot;Christ&quot; that all religions share in order to get to the divine. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
<br>
The problem is that you have a very "I am okay, you are okay" attitude towards what you consider christianity.<br>
<br>
<br>
If baptism doesnt imply water then:<br>
<br>
1: What does it imply?<br>
2: Is there anything else that someone is baptised into in scripture to recieve salvation?<br>
3: Why, when refering to salvation, is water the example used?<br>
4: If Jesus says baptism is necessary and water is the example in scripture, what would you assume is needed?<br>
<br>
Okay, lets looks at this.<br>
<br>
1Pe.3:21<br>
 And corresponding to that, baptism now saves you-- not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience-- through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,<br>
<br>
Couple things to note here.  Why does he say "no the removal of dirt from the flesh"?  Because that is what water normally does.<br>
<br>
Also note that he says "BUT an appeal to God", refering to baptism.  SO, baptism IS the appeal.  The appeal is in the form of the baptism.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also note these verses.<br>
<br>
44  While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.<br>
45 And all the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out upon the Gentiles also.<br>
46 For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered,<br>
47 "Surely no one can refuse the <b>water</b> for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?"<br>
48 And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.<br>
<br>
So they already recieved the Holy Spirit, yet they were ordered to be baptised regardless.  Looks like he is saying that despite them being gentiles, no one could refuse them water if the Holy Spirit has judged them worthy....<br>
<br>
You seem like very nice person, who understands the need for love and for believing in God, but some of your views really bother me.  Not only because of my concern for your soul, but also because I know what God says in scripture about false teaching.  I don't see anything that refers to whether the false teaching is intentional or not.<br>
<br>
Hopefully this won't come across as rude.  I really am interested in your answers.  Look it over and let me know your thoughts when you have the time. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">
