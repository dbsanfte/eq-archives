No, no it doesn't.  NOBODY pays attention to this board and your plans mean crap.  If someone is in the plane already when you show up, move on.<br>

I'll agree with the first half of this one.  Again, 90% of the server doesn't read this board so the second half is falling on deaf ears. Edit: To clarify, I think you are attempting to instruct people who are already on a planar raid to abandon their plane because guild Foo-Foo Tutu Wearers posted plans on here.  Ain't gunna happen boy-o.<br>

<br>
Yes courtesy does, but 90% of the server doesn't read this section.  I feel like I'm going to be repeating this alot.  <br>
<br>
Also, if you look at the top of this forum you will notice that: <br>
<br>
POSTING PLANS DOES NOT ENTITLE, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS RESERVATIONS<br>

Do not consider.  That is not an option.  If another group is in a p lace you posted on here for, tough luck.  Move on to a backup plan.<br>

You show up to a plane that I'm in with a guild or group and tell me that I have to leave because you posted plans on this board (again, which 90% of the people on the server don't read) and I'll tell you to politely fuck-off, so will most of the people that you will encounter already occupying a plane.<br>

YES, honorable people will refrain from coming into a plane that you are camped in whether or not they posted on this board.  You see, that's the original reason I made my Guide.  Assholes who thought posting here entitled them to the plane would routinely crash our raids ruining all our nights.<br>

Sorry, this forum means squat.  It's entire purpose is so people can advertise to form pickup planar/dragon raids.  IT IS NOT TO BE USED AS A CALENDAR.<br>

Yes, respect that the planes and dragons and gods, etc are FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE.<br>
<br>
You don't seem to understand that this is the way it has been and always will be. 10% of the server population has knowledge of this board. It cannot be used for a reservation system.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you think I was being rude or disrespectful in my original post but I've had too many tools like you show up while my guild was in a plane and claim the plane was theirs because they posted here.<br>
<br>
It's BS, always has been, always will be. Sorry pal.<br>

Even I know how to read the top line that states: &lt;Ahem&gt;<br>
<br>
--POSTING PLANS DOES NOT ENTITLE, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS RESERVATIONS--<br>
<br>
If ya want reservations I hear there are other servers that can accomodate your needs..offhand I cant remember which ones they are..but im sure someone will point you in the right direction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides, If the reservation system was to work, EVERYONE would have to read this board.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many a guild have had there raids dashed on the rocks by someone being there before them...what makes you so special now? Ya learn to live with it.<br>
<br>
To start a calendar system is really just plain ludicrous..there are too many guilds out there, and who would keep the rotation? <br>
<br>
But if you Insist, I guess im staking a reservation on the planes for every saturday(fear) and sunday(hate) monday(crushbone) nights for the next year..<br>
<br>
 RESPECT MAH AUTHORITAH<br>
<br>
now doesnt that sound silly?<br>
<br>
Granted, some raids take some time to prepare if its gonna be pickup groups, but  how do you know whats on individual guild calendars? Some guilds have the raids planned MONTHS in advance for their guild. <br>
Not everyone reads these boards, not everyone cares, some people just like to play the game. <br>
Hell, normally I just read the good threads and mark all forums read.<br>
this board means nothing.<br>
<br>
I personally have been shut out of a lot of raids because someone beat me to the punch..yes it sucks, but thats the way it goes. Ya learn to live with it, goto the backup plan, and plan main raid for another time.<br>

Almost, until the notion of PnP was brought up.<br>
<br>
This board IS a great way to go on raids. I have had some that were occupied when we arrived, but for teh most part, the greater majority of the raids went as planned. I'll use it, and coninue to use this forum. <br>
<br>
However, as strongly as Jae comes across, he is correct. You cannot claim anything. You cannot expect this board to be used my all. You cannot expect your raid to occur just because it was planned here.<br>
<br>
In a perfect world, perhaps. But it's not, and therefore have to be very flexible. <br>
<br>
Even the guilds that have the power resources to go on a Plane / Dragon raid at a whim find themselves turned away because they are occupied. Tough it out. Go to plan B. You may not like it, but what else could you do? Envoke PnP? I would not suggest that at all. There would be ramifications that you would feel for the rest of your gaming experience. But, if you're planning on moving to another server anyway, then feel free to call PnP. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line: This forum is a great tool for those people who are not in the position to be included on raids regularly. Such as myself. But this forum is by no means enforced, and CANNOT be. it'd be cool if it were, but it's just not the case. <br>
