PLANE OF FEAR 1.0.1<br>
<br>
North Wall Versus West Wall<br>
<br>
Before Kunark ... perhaps even before Hate existed ... the Planes were one tough thing to crack.  In fact - Fear was the only Plane.  When they opened Hate - is when Class specific armor occured, but before then it was Cryosilk for casters and I can't even remember the name of the armor for Melee.  This was before my time ... and NOTE - NO ONE WAS OVER 50 ... even though the MoBs are 48-52 and the Boss MoBs - like CT 55.<br>
<br>
The way it was done ... and I have the pleasure of doing it this way ... was everyone ran in invis. and mad a mad dash to the North wall (APPROX Loc:P1400 P500).  Behind the Firewall from where the Firewall starts going west to east - until it ends is a SAFE spot.  NO MOBS wander through here.  So if a cleric was under attack ... peeps would attck the mob(s) and the cleric would make camp and camp.  This got real problematic if a cleric didn't make it - and sometimes the cleric would have to attemp over and over until one made it.  Then monks would drag all the dead bodies to camp ... and the cleric would log in and begin rezzes.  This process takes about 3 hours - before you even start pulling.<br>
<br>
Then the concept of West Wall breaking started - but even Gratiano from Inner Fire has stated, &quot;This type of break is for those who have gear and levels&quot;.  In other words if you are taking a bunch of 46 lvl peeps in RO armor quest - it would be better for a North wall break - because in the end - the number of MoBs that come ... and the skill it takes ... usually waxes most teams that attempt the West Wall.<br>
<br>
The NORMAL way WEST wall is broken is that a necro, sk, or monk will go in the portal and FD on top of the hill.  They will then use the camera views in 3rd person (the 3rd F9 from first person shooter mode - or 1 F9 from the 3rd person Tomb Raider View) and will rotate the camera around and watch the patterns of the MoBS.  When the West wall, the Hill, and the surrounding arae is clear - the call for insertion is made.  Usually 2 groups at a time go in invis - 10-15 secs apart and make the wall and begin fighting as neccessary.<br>
<br>
THE REASON THE WEST WALL IS SO BAD - is that MOST PEOPLE NEVER CALL EVAC if it is bad.  I had to shut KANDON up the other day as he spewed FALSE instructions over Pimm and my own.  If your chanters call EVAC - cause LoM or TOO many mobs - get the heck out - don't wait - kill a few - and do it again - eventuly - even if it is 3 runs - you will have the wall broken.  People that stay and fight to the bitter end - ALL DIE and ALL gear is on the west wall.<br>
<br>
Now I got to try it this way a couple of times ... once was a Rider's break - and low and behold no evac - and we all die.  The problem with this is - going in naked and trying to hold the wall is very hard.  It is hard when the chanters don't have ac gear to take the hits - nor the mana to keep the influx of MoBs coming mezzed.  This method (because no evac was called) results in about 3 attempts - with tons of bodies - and someone like IF - SA - COT - or another guild now that we have some higher lvl guilds out there to come do a rescue mission.<br>
<br>
Watching Inner Fire save raids over and over again - I noticed that they would always evac if it got bad or a chanter called evac.  I have Inner Fire to thank for teaching me - to pick my battles - and that evaccing and trying again is a good thing.<br>
<br>
NOW ... enter PIMMSTRAHD.   Originally - it was Venr and I that began discussing this - as we wanted to host a raid - but both of us were chicken to do it by ourselves ... so we decided a joint effort would help.  Besides the inability to recover - there is ALWAYS someone that seems to go RIGHT out of the portal - or even STRAIGHT ... and then train the camp with Tenticle Terrors or the Fetid Fiend house ... or I have even seen Boogymen on a break - yes - from the BOOGY HOUSE.  Note that those 5-6 extra mobs can be enough to get the chanters or other casters like clerics that need to med - and sitting - they are the first targets of these extra mobs.  So - what to do - ... MAKE SURE NO MOBS (or very few - due to roaming patterns) are at the portal or West Wall.<br>
<br>
So - I get Uber Buffed - and get Harmshield ready.  When all groups are ready ... I zone in with Harmshield up - and make a circle around the portal (trust me - you don't go to the base of the hill - aggro is plenty big enough) and then head North - preferably to the West a hair - as the TT will dispell your SOW - and then you will wipe out - and more mobs will be on the west wall quicker than before.  So - pass up the Fetid House - NOTE - the fetids are slow - and wont keep up - BUT - there can be a Worry Wraith in there at times - and they love to cast their Stuns - so make sure you are holding down that run button.  By the time you make the fire wall - the Harm Shield and Rune V (Or Diamondshield ... blah blah blah) has worn off but you should be in front of most of the mobs.  Hit the North wall ... and begin your circle in the NW corner - counterclock-wise.<br>
<br>
You make the call for insert - about the time you are at the Fetid House ... and walla ... people come in - and 9 times out 10 - no mobs - and if so - most adds and mobs are 3 - and very easy to maintain.<br>
<br>
NOW - Venr and my method was this - that after all peeps got it - i just stopped running - maybe tried to FD - but for the most part - I would eat the death.  I have 3 hours for my one corpse to get xp - and we can break and pull north to my body.  With my death - Mobs would stand around and be stupid - until the next move cycle was implemented - then they would continue their normal roam pattern or return to their staic points.  Thus - west wal;l would get like 1-2 maybe 3 at a time - but everyone was there and ready to fight - no one dies on the way down ... and pretty solid.  Our first try at this theory was a success and the day we took CT.<br>
<br>
So - Pimm sees the success of this ... and NOW AT POST 50 LEVELS - says to me - you could do that - and I can CoH you back to camp - and you don't have to die.  So - Pimm and I start trying this out - and it works.  NOTE - I still die sometimes - dang frightfinger was on west wall once - and there are only so many laps you can make till you bite it.<br>
<br>
We still evac if for some reason someone manages to train us - even though we clear the portal (yes - as clear as the portal is - you can still have a YELLOW TOWER TRAIN) - and that is the real key in keeping gear.<br>
<br>
SO WHAT ABOUT WHIPEOUTS:  Well - then I run the mobs again ... the good thing is that some have evaced with gear - and the others make camp - and can loot corpses (but leave the bags) and be fully geared up ready to go again.  Since We have implemented this strategy - we have not had to get help for breaking - even in the case of a bad break.  NOTE - sometimes FEAR is mean ... deal with it ... I have done so many breaks now - and run the gauntlet so many times ... and for those of you that know me - know that Fear is my home ... sometimes on the pop - the mix of MoBs can be a harsh mix - like 90% Scares and very little spiders and apes.<br>
<br>
A NEW TACTIC:  I think it was Halaman (sp) that mentioned this to me - but this idea I have heard comes from TCC (maybe they got it somewhere - but I haven't heard of anyone else using it) is that they have a group formed with a 55 mage that can CoH.  They get the mage to North camp - and leave the other person on the outside of the portal.  The person outside the portal is the Group Leader ... and invites peeps into the group ... and when they zone in - the mage CoH the person to the North wall.  Sounds pretty cool - and I have heard that it is a pretty successful strategy.  The danger with this one is getting the mage to north camp and that CoH is a 10 second cast time (last I heard - I am not a mage).  Other than that - sounds pretty dang safe to me.<br>
<br>
All in all - you have to find one that works best for you.  A lot has changed since pre-kunark and now levels alone can be the factor.  I mean - IF and SA - can march in and pretty much own the west wall due to levels, gear, and experience - so they don't have to rely on other tactics and teaching new peeps things.  The hardest thing is the newbies to Fear.  Especially if it is their first plane raid ever.  A lot of nervousness - lack of understanding - lack of skill - if you got too much of that - you will probably wipe out.  Doesn't mean you will ... but chances are you will.<br>
<br>
A good mix to have on the break is 3 chanters and 3 clerics (I know that there are high lvl chanters that can hold this by themselves - but this is a general raiding party).  Yes - make sure you have Necros - not only does their gear drop there - but have at least one necro per enchanter - and DESIGNATE a chanter to that necro - so the chanter always has mana.  Have an evacer per team - which should be easy as there are TONS of druids that wanna go - but wizards too. Then get some beefy tanks.  Mix in the specials - like bards and shamans - and you got it made.  It would be interesting to know what IF and SA use - since they do the break with 12 or less usually ( I have seen IF do it with 12 - and I trust Sonic's word that SA does with 6 ).</font><P><center>

I think I may nominate you for a Pulitzer for them hehe. <br>
I thought I would mention something about the method of getting a mage to North camp and CoHing the group in. We had a horrible fear raid last week in which the whole zone went LD as the second set of 3 groups zoned in. My fault for not seperating them out. All 36 peeps for the most part went LD and got wasted as it was the beginning of west camp break. <br>
We tried to send in a few groups to reduce the numbers, after the wipeout, but with the tanks naked and the chanters without their gear, we couldnt dent the camp. <br>
We instead got a 60 necro (Thanks Asla) to run to North camp, Rezz the cleric (thanks Leana), who rezzed in Pimm (Stip and Chango went in naked to get Leana, Pimm and a few other corpses to North camp. As I was group leader and Pimm in my group, I stood outside the portal and Pimm CoHed people as they zoned in. It worked very quickly and effectively - we got over 30 people to north camp in a little more than an hour and we just Cohed people at random. Next time The normal mana batteries get sent in first to speed up the operation(Chanter, Necros, Bards, Mages), plus a few tanks as guards. <br>
Anyhow, Leana and I were talking today (we work together) and discussing this method, which I want to do for my next fear raid. Then we hit on this variation. Have the Mage and a caster that can invis (Druid, Wizzie, Chanter) run into Fear the night before if someone has cleared the zone (or at least a clear path to North camp)  - it takes away any risk to the mage.. They both camp. Do this before they log for the night<br>
Next day they log in, inviser invites the mage, gates out to safe rock and starts inviting people into the group, invis' them. They hit the zone, mage CoHs them (may want to have the regular FD'ed scout in fear to let people know when its safe). The normal mana batteries get sent in first to speed up the operation(Chanter, Necros, Bards, Mages), plus a few tanks as guards. Have people log to the chat room to form groups and bang, a full raid party in the safety of North camp. <br>
I think if it planned before hand the whole CoHing in would take less than an hour. <br>
<br>
