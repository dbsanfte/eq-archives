<br>
You shouldn't ever have a problem telling me I'm wrong. I respect your opinion more than most people I know, and I've only briefly chatted with you in game.<br>
<br>
That being said, I don't think I'm wrong. You can argue that the ends don't justify the means, but that's exactly what Chiteng has been (constantly) spouting for the last 3 years.<br>
<br>
I know he's not a child, but I'm not his mother, his wife, his psychiatrist, his father, his gynecologist, or his ex-high school principle.<br>
<br>
In its most basic extremes, he's nothing to me but a living body somewhere. I really don't care if he ever gets help, or if he ever drops his vendetta.<br>
<br>
As long as he's quiet about.<br>
<br>
I normally feel that the ends NEVER justify the means. But with Chiteng, it's like fighting an uphill battle with a large hairy woman. You're probably not going to win, and you're going to have to wrestle around with a large hairy sweat covered woman in the process.<br>
<br>
It hardly seems worth it to me.<br>
<br>
The ONLY way to avoid Chiteng is to ignore him. He posts to de-rail a thread and you just totally pretend his post doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
You're not going to &quot;show him&quot;! You're not going to change his mind. You're just going to increase the festering.<br>
<br>
You know better than to scratch poison ivy rashes, and it's the same way with Chiteng. Let it die naturally.<br>
<br>
Now, that's the last I'm posting on the subject, feel free to talk with me about it in game, because I'm heeding my advice.<br>

<br>
to wit you quoted (check your post, &quot;quote&quot; was the word YOU used) that Kerryn said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;I'll stay out of it&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  And you then went on to say it was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;an exact quote &quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Unfortunately that was your main stumbling block.. you see before I asked you that question I was well aware of what Kerryn had ACTUALLY said (to the point I double checked).  And you see, what you actually did was MISQUOTE what Kerryn had said.<br>
<br>
He didn't JUST say that he'd stay out of it, oh no.  But you conveniently DID NOT quote the rest of his sentence whereby he said he would stay out of it until a time he saw fit.<br>
<br>
By only quoting half of what he said you twisted his words in such a way as to show you in a favourable light .. HOWEVER, had you have quoted EXACTLY what he said then YOU would have been proven wrong, since he never at any point said he would stop posting in your threads permanently.<br>
<br>
Now you are trying to back pedal .. you are saying it is an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;exact copy&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> since you cut and pasted it from one of Kerryn's posts.  whether you copy and pasted it or not IS NOT the issue here, what YOU said originally was that it was an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> exact QUOTE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and NOT a copy, which is what you are now saying.  Thus changing your story and trying to get out of the hole you have dug yourself.  Because if you had correctly quoted what Kerryn was saying then you would'nt have been able to answer my question truthfully, you can't point us to where he said &quot;he would stop posting in your threads&quot; because he never said it.<br>
<br>
Chiteng you can't pick and choose pieces of a persons sentences to quote JUST because the sentence in it's entirety would make your claims invalid, that is twisting someone's words and tantamount to lying.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion.. you have misquoted someone, lied about it being an exact quote and are now changing your story to try and escape the repercussions of your actions.<br>
<br>
You deliberately doctored his words to suit your purpose, you lied about what he said, you lied about the QUOTE being exact, you lied about what you said in your previous post by changing your story.  In this case, you sir are a liar. <p><center>--------<center>

It is.<br>
<br>
I didnt claim that it followed either his intent or yours. In fact I went out<br>
of my way to warn the reader that I was NOT quoting him in context.<br>
<br>
Because I did warn the reader, you will get no satisfaction. Call me anything you like. That only makes it clear what YOU are. <br>
<br>
You keep ignoring the fact that I did warn the reader. Thats great, I know I did.<br>
<br>
Just like I am no longer concerned about Kerryn calling me a liar. As long as there<br>
was ANY chance that it was a simple misunderstanding, I was concerned.<br>
His last post clarified that he had no interest at all in 'truth' in any form.<br>
His sole interest was in 'Winning' his word. Therefore he is no more that Raedwulf.<br>
I had hoped you were. But I am often wrong. Cest la vie.<br>
<br>
That will be my last post on your attempt to derail the original topic.<br>
If such attempt continue, I will simply start another thread.<br>

Or do you not like when people play you at your own game?<br>
<br>
You see, this IS the reality of the Erollisi Marr messageboard or at least the Rants and Flames section of it.. it's pretty hard to derail a thread like this anyway unless we all started talking about Real World things or food or something not relating to Erollisi Marr, the players on the server and Everquest in general.<br>
<br>
Oh believe me I quite agree that you quoted him out of context and I certainly didn't ignore the fact that you warned everyone you had done so.  I also agree that what you cut and pasted was an exact copy of a 5 word string that Kerryn used.<br>
<br>
However, if you'd care to take a look back at your 1718th post on 4th of August at 6:50:45 am you will see that YOU yourself posted a &quot;quote&quot; from Kerryn's post in answer to a question I posed you.  You then proceeded to tell the readers that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;The above is an <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>exact quote</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> from a Kerryn post.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  The answer you gave me was untrue, not because it was out of context but because you deliberatly misquoted him.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between quoting someone out of context, and MISQUOTING them completely just to further ones own ends.  And I'm sure you are well aware of that difference.  When I challenged you on the point that it was indeed NOT an &quot;exact quote&quot; as you had stated your story changed, and now you are saying it was just a copy.<br>
<br>
In an effort to keep this on topic lets look back at your first post Chiteng.  You speak about a fight to impart information unhindered unto these boards, i agree with that but I draw the line when people start to impart disinformation and believe that that type of incorrect information should be hindered .. and to that end I'd like to use this very topic we are discussing (me, you, Kerryn and the misquote issue) as an example of where the imparting on information SHOULD infact be hindered.  Perhaps I don't mean hindering information as such, more dispelling rumours and falsehoods from what true information is imparted.<br>
<br>
You see, I asked you a legitimate question which involved you quoting another board member.  And your answer was an &quot;exact Quote&quot; of said board member albeit out of context but that's fine, however upon checking your &quot;exact quote&quot; I found that conveniently there were a few words of the same sentence had been missed off the end which makes the quote NOT exact as you stated and, had they been included, would have undermined your previous statement which promted me to ask the question.<br>
<br>
I'm almost of the feeling that you have fallen into the &quot;self-aggrandizement&quot; catagory since it seems you are now trying to score points against Kerryn, and also trying to &quot;shut down the issue&quot; where I called you out on the validity of your information (which you imparted unhindered).<br>
<br>
You've said in the past that you want to oust all the cheaters, liers, exploiters and so on.. surely if you wish to do that then you need to be clean of such things yourself??<br>

So unless we agree with you, your topic is unrefuted?  But if we did agree with you, your topic would also be unrefuted.  You've once again demonstrated that my newest nickname for you, Ostrich Boy, is 100% accurate.  If someone's comments do not agree with your particular paranoid view of reality, you ignore it.  Good going.<br>
<br>
Your original thread has been refuted over and over and over again.  My first post was the first such refutation, but there have been others.  How ludicrous for you to pretend otherwise. <p>-- The Grump formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aganerral>Aganerral</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/5/02 10:22:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3523.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The end of the thread</span><hr size=1> I believe that Raedwulf's first post in this thread was in reply to your original post, and you dismissed it without responding to his points.<br>
<br>
In any case, referring to the original post:<br>
<br>
I don't see any hindrances to you spreading information here.  You haven't been banned.  I haven't seen your posts and htreads edited by admins or deleted.  Thus, your ability to share information in these forums is unhindered.<br>
<br>
The fact that people disagree with you is not 'hindering' the ability to share information.  It just means that they don't agree.  They read your posts, divine whatever knowledge they can gain from it, weigh that against other sources of infomration or their own moralcode, and decide that they don't think thesame way as you do.<br>
<br>
If you really do have truth and fact on your side yet people disagree with you, perhaps it's not the message itself but the manner in which its delivered.  Aside from the holier-than-thou tone of your posts, I'm referring specifically to the vagueness.  You've stated previously that you are intentionally vague.  But if you're trying to prove a point, you need to give details for people to understand what you're trying to say so that you don't appear to be simply ranting.<br>

If I have a bit of time over lunch, maybe I'll try and recall the thread where you admitted the quote equally applies to you.  Or maybe one of those better at it than I will do so (my research skills suck) like Ryn or Carathos.<br>

Unlike most of the rest of us, you don't attack someones silliness just in the thread they make it, but you create whole threads devoted to attacking them.  And the above examples are just in the first two pages. <p>-- The Grump formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uchiteng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiteng</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1756<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/7/02 10:31:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3523.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raedwulf</span><hr size=1> You maligned me, so you invited rebuttal.

I said it was RARE, Raedwulf. Not that I had never done it. <br>
<br>
There is a difference you see. Plus after reading the threads you posted just now,<br>
some of my comments were on topic, and some didnt actually target anyone,<br>
they were generic. But you do whatever keeps you feeeling usefull.<br>
<br>
On a statistical basis of total number of posts vs posts where I actually<br>
target someone for attack, NOT RELATED TO DEFENDING MYSELF,<br>
the number is quite small. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”
