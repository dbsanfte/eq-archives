Guildy told me about it.<br>
Lemme tell ya a little story:<br>
<br>
One day, my 13th level necro was hangin around the Qeynos arena lookin for a fight (just for fun with a friend) Suddenly I see a shout. Binidin shouts: &quot;Levels 5-15 come to the arena for a tournament! Winner gets great prizes!&quot; i think &quot;prizes? awsome, im the highest level in the zone right now&quot; So i go and tell him im interested. He says cool wait for some others to come. So I wait, and med and such and eventually 3 other worthy opponents around my level come, and binidin's friend to ref. The rules are set down... its a fight to the death.<br>
<br>
The first fight is on, me vs. Binidin. I proceed to whomp on his ass until he runs from the PvP area. I say &quot;what the heck, its to the death! come back&quot; the ref then heals him and he comes back for more. hurt and OOM, I step out of the PvP area. Now he was silent through all this, but now he starts sending tells like &quot;Pu**y! Come fight me!&quot; So, I go back to fight him, and he flees again. I think, ok screw this and i go sit in the Pvp area.<br>
<br>
The next few fights commence and during every one BINIDIN jumps in and attacks someone... when its not his fight. then if threatened he runs from Pvp and gets healed.<br>
<br>
All the combatants of the &quot;tournament&quot; being very mad as we were, lured him back in, rooted him, and thrashed him several times. He then began calling up things on /shouts in S qeynos. We all ignored him and left. <br>
<br>
If anyone deserves to be on the shitlist, its him. Oh and i heared he's like 10 in real life. No lie.<br>

<br>
Was watching the &quot;Lowest of the Low&quot; Monk tourney in the arena in Qeynos. This guy brought in a level 1 monk and was a little jerk, so the person running the tourney asked him to leave. He didnt, so he was killed by a referee. He came back with his 13 warrior and started harrassing the tourney people again. I sent a tell to the person running it that if he tried anything I'd smack him around (39 monk at the time).<br>
<br>
I sent him a tell saying as much. He replied with &quot;Oh yeah tough guy, would you be so tough to a level60?!&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point I hit auto attack <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (he was standing in the arena ground)<br>
<br>
Really lucky first strike, did a quad hit for around 100, followed up with a flying kick for around 50.<br>
<br>
He buggered off for a while, then showed back up. I just made sure to shadow him and he didnt bother the tourney again.<br>
<br>
I've seen him hanging around the bank when playing with my 10 ranger, but he's never asked me for anything. <p>Lotwell<br>

Binidin.<br>
<br>
Here's my two cents. My primary's name is Ahaz, a 35 wizard and the BF mentioned by Anjulie in an earlier post. We started some secondary's a while back, Anjulie trying to go Warrior from bard and me deciding a try at ranger. Great stuff. I'm up to level 9, Zummy(anjulie) is 10, and our friend fubbin's alternate mage is 9 as well and we're hitting Erud Crossing together. Anj complains the whole boat ride to the crossing about this rude idiot that had been pestering her in Qeynos, some warrior named Binidin and Colas and I were chuckling away about some of her comments about the begging she received. We hunt at the crossing for a while when who shows up? You guessed it :-)<br>
<br>
Binidin comes up to Zummy pestering her again and she puts him on ignore so he turns to me. Sigh. I honestly had the impression it was some little kid and felt kinda sorry for him so I told him if he was still on in a hour or so I'd log on my primary and give him a bronze BP I had in the bank. He zooms over to me and inspects me and gets angry because I'm not wearing a bronze BP. I explained to him that no, I wasn't, another character of mine had it in the bank and I'd log him on later and give it to him. Next thing I see in my chat window is him spamming the zone about what a lier I am. You can imagine how soon he was gonna get his BP after that... grrrrrr. Now I'm getting tells from him where he's swearing at me and calling me all kinds of names, just generally being a pain. So I got stupid. I challenged him to a duel.<br>
<br>
For those of you who - like me - never duel much, here's a tip. If you hit a PC in Erud Crossing the Cat people there will beat the tar out of you. Sigh. I could accept the death as a learning experience, but the constant tells from Binidin to the effect of &quot;HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA you #$%@#$&quot; really got on my nerves. Arrrrrgh! <br>
<br>
Now I'm coming back on the boat for the CR and I get a tell from Binidin asking me if I wanted to settle this or bring the GM's into it. If you're like me you're confused at this leap of logic. I asked him what he was talking about and he told me he was going to petition and get me banned. I'm not leaving things out here people. I can't see what I'd done wrong or how GM's had even come into the conversation. So I told him I'd re-duel him after my CR. He kept trying to threaten me with getting banned somhow so I finally told him to go ahead and contact a GM if he wanted, I'd don't nothing wrong but I did have screen shots of the tells where he'd been swearing at me and maybe the GM's would like those. He logged. I have to apologise here to everyone including Binidin. This all started because he accused me of lieing, and I'd just lied... I never took any screenshots :-(. <br>
<br>
There is a happy ending to this story though. An hour later he logged back on. I found him away from the Cats and challenged him. He eventually started to flee, and ran close to some cats and they aggroed on him and killed him. I felt good about that for days. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urugenpayne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rugen payne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/9/01 11:01:47 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.darke.net/~alex/rugenpixel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Portrait of Binidin</span><hr size=1> /report is your friend.<br>

..simply statede 90% of people that are now 50+ begged as a newbie. it's something character's just get rid of as they grow older in levels and experience. NOT SHITLIST MATERIAL.<br>
I begged as a newbie. i used to stake out banks and ask for 20pp to every person. i made ALOT of money. This guy is probably no longer on lanys. or has started a new character. if you ignore them instead of acting stupid and ooc'ing omg this newbie is a begger. they will leave you alone. <br>
GRANTED that sometimes there is horrible beggers. One lvl 6 kept recking my kites and annoying me so much. i solved it MYSELF though instead of /petitioning or bringing it to this list. I tp'ed him to dreadlands and left him.<br>
I'd like to express my appreciation for the lanys moderators altering the rules for this list. you've made it better *nod*<br>

Easy to cope with.<br>
<br>
But, this guy is different. He takes begging to a new level, and, it is not just the begging, it is the abusive levels he gets to when he does not get his way. Are you even reading the post's that other people are putting up?<br>
It seems he still is a problem. I was just told by a friend of mine that he was invited to a guild, but soon thrown out for causing others within the guild problems. IF there was not a problem with this guy, there would not be this many posts. Why don't you go talk to the people who have had to put up with him? See how they feel. This is ONE very bad apple. This is also the only time I have ever shitlisted some one. This was posted because of actual events that happened, and have happened to ALOT of others it seems.<br>
<br>
I do not know if I know you ingame, but, why are you so agressive about this? Your post seems to be based upon your personal speculation. You have not put up with what some of us have had to with this indiviual. If he is a friend of yours, your better off taking him aside, and talking some sense into him rather than screaming at us to remove the post about him. Not only has he accosted me, but, he has also verbally assaulted some of my friends.<br>

I come off strongly simply because im against the shitlist. I read a few posts and saw that he was a begger. if there is more keep him up here. my apoligies for coming off so strongly.<br>
but my opinion still is that this is not enough of an offense to stay up here. I think the shitlist Is used as a belt for people to flame and try to punish eachother. Due to the new rules I think this might change a bit.<br>

My advice to you binidin and others like him, Watch how far you go in begging. act like an asshole to me and i'll make sure your corpse is rotting in Ice clad or Dreadlands before I log. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Heard it from a ranger that statement. )<br>

This guy seems like he belongs here.  It's not the begging that he is shitlisted for, it's the attitude and abusiveness he has that is the main topic for the listing.<br>

<br>
I do think begging is a problem when it becomes intrusive into peoples game: persistant tells of begging, spam begging, and the worst I have ever seen ... blocking the door of the bank in freeport.  I was so mad.  There was a traffic jam of barbarians all stuck outside the bank cause a beggar wouldnt move, and he said he wouldnt move.  Luckily he unknowingly accepted a duel from a warrior and needless to say, we got our banking done.<br>
<br>
I agree with ult that simple begging, asking for alms, whatever is fine.  However, intrusive begging is definately shitlistable, and I think this guy fits the bill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usavilashkevron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Savil Ashkevron</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/10/01 6:13:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BINIDIN  (10th Level Half Elf Warrior/BEGGER) :(</span><hr size=1> someone should use that log function (never used it so don't know what it's called) and just let him moan and groan, and if you can get his age in there, even better, then use it against him.  the earlier we get rid of people like this, the better we will all feel, and then we wouldn't be stuck making long posts like this.<br>
<br>
fortunately, i haven't had the pleasure of meeting this guy, as i love to hunt them corrupt guards.  for those that are unfortunate, just do what you can do to make his day worse than what he makes yours.<br>
<br>
duels work, shadowing works, spamming the screen works (jboots are great  for something like that), ports work, trains work, whatever you can do to make his life hell, do it, he seems to have no problems makin yours hell. <p><BR>
