<br>
See the quote that Mitch responded to. Elwyn further clarified by saying that he has never sold or purchased <b>any</b> items on ebay, no character specification.<br>
<br>
As for Mitch, the Mistress Cleo of Emarr... We’re all so very, very impressed at your vast wealth of knowledge to pull upon whenever the situation turns against you. I find it rather amazing that you would somehow know Elwyn ebay’d something. If he told anyone it sure as hell wouldn’t be you. Or maybe you heard it from a viable source, Chiteng perhaps? Is there anyone you don’t have some dirt on?<br>
<br>
Is it getting increasingly more difficult to separate the fact from the fiction in your head, or do you just make shit up as you go along and then forget about it? Your arguments are shallow and full of fiction, just like your person. If someone pulls out facts and presents them against you, you concoct a story that they can’t possibly disprove(that has nothing to do with the argument at hand, by the way), I’ll admit – you’ve got skill in that department. Did your high-school aptitude test say “best suited for becoming a crooked cop and planting false evidence”?<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>Now either post somethign factual, ie you have proof of what you say, or STFU and crawl back to DAOC gimp.</font><br>
<br>
How the fuck can you prove to the world you’ve never sold/bought anything on ebay. There’s no blood/DNA testing for ebay, sorry. Do a user-search for EqBardRox0rz but since it doesn’t exist you won’t find it and therefore he never sold anything. Is this lack of logic, like, sinking in…at all?<br>
<br>
For you, Mitch the fucking loot-whore, to question the ethics of ANYONE blows my fucking mind. Let’s weigh in your moral character for a second. You’ve left or been kicked out of a at least 4 guilds, more than most people have ever belonged to. You’ve admitted to keeping gear that was loaned to you, because you deemed the loaner to be a tool(not that I like Aerosa either) or what not. You’ve had more gear pass through your hands and turn into pp than any other person has, on the server. If I examined the facts and was going to accuse anyone of ebaying gear/pp, it would be you, without a second thought.<br>
<br>
Calling Elwyn a gimp, now that’s rich. I seem to recall him crouching down to loot every piece of gear he owned. He didn’t have the pleasure of standing in the EC tunnel and buying 3 Cloak of Flames before he even saw a dragon(coming to my raid at level 30 to take screenshots doesn’t count). Your entire EQ history has shown that you're nothing more than a wannabe, ever reaching for the ‘uber carrot’ dangling before your face. You reach out with all your will, tripping and falling to your knees with nothing to show for your efforts, only a single word echoing in the distance – pathetic.<br>
<br>
By the way, all my guild mates are very interested in hearing your reply. They want to know what I said about them now, or maybe you can make some shit up about the Shriners. I was guilded with them in EQ as well.<br>
<br>
p.s. Gerome knows I called him a tubby-bitch, so you can skip that one.<br>

As I stated further up in this thread, I did have permission to sell it, then that permission was retracted, so it is no longer for sale, sorry.<br>

We’re all so very, very impressed at your vast wealth of knowledge to pull upon whenever the situation turns against you''<br>
<br>
<br>
No situation, as you put it, has turned against me Ven, as usual though your spinmanship is good.<br>
<br>
<br>
'' Is there anyone you don’t have some dirt on?''<br>
<br>
<br>
Only the honest decent people Ven, btw after all your talk about Chiteng obsessing about DK its highly hypocritical of you to bring his name into this, but then you never were bothered by hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
<br>
''If someone pulls out facts and presents them against you, you concoct a story that they can’t possibly disprove(that has nothing to do with the argument at hand, by the way), I’ll admit – you’ve got skill in that department''<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok lets look at this sentence, your words not mine.  Please show me any post, anywhere, where someone has posted facts Ven.  You seem to periodically try and beat this dead horse months after your old guildies admitted they were wrong (publically and clearly and also some in-game) and I appreaciated their character in admittign that after all the attempted character besmirchign by people such as you btw.  Let me give you an example of a fact Vendrix.<br>
<br>
I kept and destroyed a shitty bracer someone gave me when they called me a thief.<br>
<br>
That Vendrix is a fact, I gladly and openly admitted it, rightly or wrongly i gave my reasons and i stand by them.  The point is that it is a F A C T.  Now lets move to rumours and supposition and character slander, you see Ven thats all you and Elwyn have ever had, never (and for the love of god if you have proof please post it) in all the time you've both psoted here have you ever EVER posted any actual hard evidence or facts.  I challenge you again, post some<br>
<br>
<br>
''How the fuck can you prove to the world you’ve never sold/bought anything on ebay. There’s no blood/DNA testing for ebay, sorry. Do a user-search for EqBardRox0rz but since it doesn’t exist you won’t find it and therefore he never sold anything. Is this lack of logic, like, sinking in…at all?''<br>
<br>
<br>
And here you let me down Ven, I sprinkled heavy hints through my latter replies to Elwyn and yet you missed them, allow me to quote myself:<br>
<br>
1.<br>
''Now either post somethign factual, ie you have proof of what you say, or STFU and crawl back to DAOC gimp.<br>
<br>
I'll let the smarter people read between the lines on this little exchange, i'm sure some of them enjoy the irony, I know I do.''<br>
<br>
2.<br>
''I have a better idea. Why don't you post some proof that he did? I love it how people come on here and start saying some shit about how guild X did this or person X did that without posting one shred of proof. ''<br>
<br>
Thats an excellant point Celdor, carry through with that thought...''<br>
<br>
3.<br>
''I quite honestly have no idea what you're talking about. If you'd like to post something specific instead of vague, groundless accusations and then telling ME to disprove them, I'd be happy to answer.''<br>
<br>
That sentence seems familiar to me''<br>
<br>
Is the message getting through yet?<br>
<br>
I'll deal with the rest of this crap before I explain:<br>
<br>
is leaving guilds bad?  you left Da'Kor for TS, are you bad?  I was asked to leave DG and have never ever denied it.<br>
''You’ve left or been kicked out of a at least 4 guilds''<br>
<br>
''more than most people have ever belonged to''<br>
<br>
Bullshit<br>
<br>
''You’ve admitted to keeping gear that was loaned to you, because you deemed the loaner to be a tool(not that I like Aerosa either) or what not''<br>
<br>
100% agreed although the gear in question was destroyed, small clarification.<br>
<br>
<br>
''You’ve had more gear pass through your hands and turn into pp than any other person has, on the server.''<br>
<br>
More than likely :)<br>
<br>
''If I examined the facts and was going to accuse anyone of ebaying gear/pp, it would be you, without a second thought.''<br>
<br>
But you did that months ago Vendrix, and you got slammed, heavily, by many many people because it was adjudged to be made up bullshit (sorry Leiran)<br>
<br>
<br>
''I seem to recall him crouching down to loot every piece of gear he owned''<br>
<br>
Whose ass was he kissing as he leaned over btw?<br>
<br>
<br>
''He didn’t have the pleasure of standing in the EC tunnel and buying 3 Cloak of Flames before he even saw a dragon(coming to my raid at level 30 to take screenshots doesn’t count)''<br>
<br>
You say that as if tradign for items is a bad thing, and yet you used my services to trade for you on quite a few occaisions, for which I never took a penny off you, if you remember.  <br>
<br>
I am proud of earnign some of the gear by trading and you are in no position to judge how I play this game you egotistical facist<br>
Hypocrite<br>
<br>
''By the way, all my guild mates are very interested in hearing your reply. They want to know what I said about them now, or maybe you can make some shit up about the Shriners. I was guilded with them in EQ as well.''<br>
<br>
All your guild mates?  IE come in boys I need some backup!, fight your own battles or dont turn up gimp, neither you nor your friends impress me, I've been there, walked away unscathed and got the fucking T-shirt.<br>
<br>
Now to return to Elwyn.<br>
<br>
No, of course Elwyn has not (to my knowledge) sold anything on Ebay.  And whether he did or not was not the point, I thought my 'hints' were clear enough to people with the brains to read them but perhaps in hindsight, lookign at the 3 'hints' I quoted you may be just able to grasp that I was pointing out the hypocrisy of shouting innocent when someone accuses you of something and repeating to me the very same arguments i posted to you and Elwyn so many many times, your replies were predictable and predicted, expected and manipulated to show you how it feels to have someone accusing you of somethign which although you are innocent, you have no way of proving.  Unlike you i am not malicious enough to perpetuate an untruth concernign someone (even Elwyn whom i hold no love for) also unlike you I always have, and always will, admit to blame and errors.  You especially Vendrix have never admitted it when you fuck up (and you have) becuase you cannot take the loss of face.<br>
<br>
One thing I'll never retract however is you tellign me, directly in groupsay, sat there chattign in sol b as you levelled your rogue, what a set of wannabe fuckign gimps your ex-guildmates were and how you despised Koryo and blamed him for the breakup of Dk on EQ and how if you wanted, you could take all the DK people to another server tomorrow.  I dont retract it because its the FUCKING TRUTH.<br>
<br>
I'd aplogise to Elwyn for using him to make a point but as i dotn like him and he's a dick, fuck it.<br>

Mitch, umoja would never tell you jack shit about me becuase for one you NEVER were a part of Umoja. your probation period was failing, you had several *NO* votes on you already, your ass was a day from being Kanyabooted  . You alienated members with your posts on the Umoja board. ya know the one telling  other members they shouldnt bid on auctions you wanted. remember that one?<br>
<br>
<br>
I left Umoja becuase it turned into United Independent ver2.0 and not the guild i joined 6 months earlier.<br>

Caveat:  Don't know Elwyn and not making fun of him.  Just an observation that struck me as funny. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubralanblacke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bralan blacke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/3/01 3:56:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bralan</span><hr size=1> Mitch, Chuk is simply sticking up for a friend.

I have not made an issue of this on purpose.  If I find a reason to flame Mitch then I will do it on my own.  Until that time I choose to keep my mouth shut.  When the time comes I will simply send Mitch a tell and we will speak about it there.  Not on this message board.  <br>

I think Bralan covered this one nicely :)<br>

Bullshit, i suppose thats why they invited me back then?  doh logic not your strong point is it chuk, nice job running out on your friends when they needed you. <br>
<br>
Bralan np, best way to get in touch right now is UI board if you need me for anything, take it easy.<br>
