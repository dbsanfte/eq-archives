To reply to her would be to reward her conceit. Not something I am willing to do.<br>
Her motives are transparent and dont require consideration. Obviously YOU dont agree. Great. If it comforts you to think that this is all I do, by all means think that.<br>

Time between my post and your post? 12 minutes, give or take a few.  No really, you have a life outside of this board... honest, we believe you.  Chump.<br>
<br>
Far as it goes, I think she has shown pretty well that she is not only a pretty bright person but someone whose Moron Tolerance is far higher than mine.  However, if it makes you feel better to ignore valid questions and attacks on your integrety because of your hypocrisy, who am I to disillusion you that you are regarded as anything but a pathetic little man with nothing but time and an empty life on his hands?<br>
<br>
She called you on your lies.  You hemmed and hawed.  Other posters have actually done what you requested and condemned Vendrix's behavior (and how the heck did he morph into yet another of your threads anyways? You talk about Chuk having a hard-on for Mitch, well good lord jesus man, you seem to want Vendrix in the nastiest way).  You hemmed and hawed and qualified.  You have not recieved a single iota of support, the community rejects you.  We don't want your help, we don't want to see justice done if it is going to be your sick little pervert mind dolling it out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Myself, like a vast majority of the posters on the boards these days, has never met anyone whom your &quot;crusade&quot; purports to fight.  I, like the vast majority of the posters on the boards these days, came into this with a pretty open mind.  When you have had good points, I, like the vast majority of the posters on the boards these days, have said so.  Unfortunately, you don't anymore.  You are a one trick dog who gets his rush off having people pay attention, any kind of attention, to him so he can find someone besides himself to hate.<br>
<br>
Time and again, when you are called on your hypocrisy, you dance around and change the subject.  A new thread is building inside you now, I will bet it.  You got your ass kicked in this one, time to move on, neh Chiteng?<br>
<br>
Oh and Toxx, start up a drive for donations.  Every time Chiteng posts, folks donate a dollar.  You may have to restrict this to the wealthier posters, however.  It would raise that money pretty freaking fast though. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.

<br>
Good god man, Kerryn did not misquote you, your sentence of, "BTW - To quote a great man(depending on if you think he was)" is rather indicative of the fact that you think he is a great man. If you did not think they were, you would not have phrased it as if you did.<br>
<br>
By the way, I do not think they were great men, great conquerors, strategists, leaders, and motivators? yes; but not by any means great men in my eyes. <br>

Maybe it's that part about calling upon Nuldar to notice you tried to avoid this that has me laughing. Let me tell you that if you wanted to avoid this you could have done one simple thing.<br>
<br>
It was so easy it required you to do nothing. You want to know what's coming? I'll tell you. It's a lifetime of people laughing at you, sniggering behind your back, thinking that you are mentally ill. It's years and years of being the outsider, the person that nobody wants to be around, that people would rather not exist. Thats whats coming, hate and ridicule. And its coming to you.<br>
<br>
All your support has gone.<br>
<br>
I didn't ram my words down your mouth. I quoted you. Effectively I rammed your words down your mouth. So once again you've lied. Thats not all that hard to imagine though with you being a pathological liar. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

I repeat the question three times so that you cant miss it.<br>
<br>
And since you bring it up, Nice freinds you have Kerryn, people who threaten<br>
other people with assault. That is SUCH an admirable quality. I am sure you sleep<br>
better with such people backing you. <br>
<br>
That is all your petty warped hatred allows you to see. You stretch any possible<br>
meaning to suit your obsessed quest to find SOMETHING/ANYTHING that<br>
gives the appearance of being wrong.<br>
<br>
That IS a pathology Kerryn, a very ugly one. But I will just restrict it to calling you a STUPID Liar. Since maybe you cant read. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

<br>
I welcome free discussion, and engaging in it is one of my favorite things to do, I don't intimidate anyone on these boards and if some one does not post because they think they will be abused by me, that’s their problem.<br>
<br>
I don't hate you Chiteng, no matter how much we disagree, no matter what names we call each other, and no matter what, if anything, you ever do to me in game, I will never hate you. For me to develop a feeling that strongly against you you would have to do me a great harm in real life, not in a game, and not on a message board.<br>

I don't think Kerryn hates you either.<br>

Wow Chiteng you have one friend!! Now let me break it down and show you how stupid you really are. You say that there is only one person willing to speak out and say something? Have you ever considered Chiteng that no one actually likes you or gives a fvck about your cause?<br>
<br>
You always ask us to provide evidence Chiteng, now it's your turn, prove to us there is a silent majority out there or I am afraid that I am going to have to call you a liar yet again.<br>

That word legitimizes everything you do.<br>
You would ask a man to condemn a freind on the word of a psychopath,<br>
you would malign a man that has never harmed you, whos crusade RIGHT OR WRONG does not in any way impact you. You would cast down the truth and<br>
raise up a lie, and worship it, for convenience. You condemn people that you<br>
could EASILY avoid. Just to elevate yourself in your own eyes. You seek solace in the like minded, and feed on each others hate. No more than human jackals.<br>
You dont even concern yourself with the details of the object you hate, they<br>
dont matter to you. Even now you cant tell me who it is that is the greatest<br>
target of my crusade. You have no idea. Yet you do his bidding, and he hasnt even asked you. He would LAUGH at you if he even knew. Your just another wannabe to him.<br>
<br>
You pay lip service to the concept of honor, and dont even know what the word means. You justify everything you do, by using the word 'game'.<br>
<br>
Allow me to impart the obvious. You cannot create time, nor can you give it away.<br>
If you cost another man time you HAVE harmed him. Dont tell me that I do the same. No one needs to read ANYTHING I write. You inflict me upon yourself,<br>
like a self-absorbed masochist. Whatever I am, and no matter how deluded you think I am, I dont come close to what you do. I seek truth. I will pay the price.<br>
If you had not attacked me I would never have even noticed you. That is YOUR free will.<br>
<br>
I have done no more than defend myself from you mindless attacks. I feel no shame. <br>
<br>
But its all just a game, right? And you know the mind of God? Let us hope he<br>
agrees with you. Yes I see much to pity, a posturing prancing egostist,<br>
who doesnt even know what hes doing. Take another look at Kerryn's last post.<br>
But you will feed that fire, because you can, and he is weak and values your comfort. Do you even know what that makes you?<br>

First,  you start this post, and implicate a list of individuals and then go on to tell us all how they are bad because they lie and what not to make you look bad.  They go to great lengths yadda yadda yadda.<br>
<br>
you then say that the reason for the post isn't what the title and the content of the first post imply,  but rather that Dwark is the reason for this post.<br>
<br>
You did say this did you not?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No Dwark, I say this to YOU personally. I would NOT be here, nor would I be posting, if not for YOU. YOU are the cause. They CAN blame you because its true.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So, you defend that position for some time,  so it is now not to point out that the list are bad,  but instead because dwark is bad and is making you post....<br>
<br>
you THEN say....  to Kerryn might I add<br>

<br>
You did say those things,  I am not making them up. . . so,  gotta ask.. and can't wait for the spin you are going to put on this one.<br>
<br>
Who or What is the reason for this thread,  because quite frankly  YOU dont even know.<br>

Now to play YOUR game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No if I wanted to indicate that I liked them I would have said so.<br>

Well,  pulling your own phrase out of context is pretty slick.  Not to mention misquoting yourself...<br>
<br>
<br>
YOU typed, not us. . not a ghost,  not a little mouse. . YOU typed<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> BTW - To quote a great man(depending on if you think he was)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is what you typed.  Now,  had you typed  To quote a great man..  that would mean what?  That would mean that you thought he was a great man as fact.   Not opinion.<br>
<br>
Adding the parenthesis statement at the end only validates it as an opinion. It is pretty simple,  and again I am sure you will come up with your own version of what it means  but it is pretty clear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The biggest point to this response to you is the previous scenario.   Please. . at the VERY least  PICK a purpose for this thread.<br>
<br>
To condemn and poing out the folly of the listed people and the wrongs they are putting on you?<br>
<br>
or is it<br>
<br>
Dwarken?<br>
<br>
Or is it<br>
<br>
Kerryn?<br>
<br>
Or is it someone else,  and you are waiting to surprise us with this new name?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also..  aren't you getting tired of this yet?<br>
<br>
being called on for every stupid think you do must really get tiring, frustrating at least.   Maybe it is time to sit back,  reset your thoughts, and try a new approach.  Maybe being a little clearer,  a little more sure of your &quot;crusade&quot;,  maybe a little more sure of your &quot;purpose&quot;.  Would be easier to keep things straight in the long run if YOU know what YOU are talking about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigota.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Igota</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 999<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/28/02 4:53:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3500.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dwarkarn</span><hr size=1> <font color='yellow'>He would LAUGH at you if he even knew.

Let 'him' laugh all he wants, I probably don't even know him, and I cirtinly don't care if he laughs at me, because I do not know him. I also don't care if he considers me to be a wannabe, I am who I am, and my friends know it, what do I care about some random persons basless opinion of me.<br>

<br>
I justify nothing by calling it a game, I do not disrespect my fellow players or their play time, I do not do things in game that I would not do in person, and I most cirtainly know what honor is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color='yellow'>If you cost another man time you HAVE harmed him.</font><br>
<br>
I fully agree. I said I would not hate you for anything you could do to me in a game, because I can't hate someone for wasteing my time. I did not say it is just a game so it does not matter, I only said that there is nothing that can be done in it that would be grevious enough for me to hate you.<br>
<br>
<font color='yellow'>No one needs to read ANYTHING I write. You inflict me upon yourself, like a self-absorbed masochist.</font><br>
<br>
Correct to a point, I do not have to read your posts, I make the choice and do read them. The part of that sentance that is wrong is that I do not feel that reading your posts is 'inflitcting' yourself upon me, it does not pain me to read your posts. I actively chose to read your posts because I enjoy responding to you, it is rather envolving.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color='yellow'>Take another look at Kerryn's last post. But you will feed that fire, because you can, and he is weak and values your comfort.</font><br>

He is not week, and does not need my comfort. We support each other because we have similer interests and we both respect the other's opinions.<br>

to come share in your feeding frenzy. They dont matter. They are bottom feeders.<br>
But you are willing to LIE to make your obscure point. You encourage your 'FREIND'<br>

<br>
NO Igota. When a REAL man catches me in a real error, I do admit it. I will not cave in to such craven cowards. Bring it on, have your fun, show the world.<br>
