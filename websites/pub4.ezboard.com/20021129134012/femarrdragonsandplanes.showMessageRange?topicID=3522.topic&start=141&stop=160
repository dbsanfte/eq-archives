You then brought in your rogue which server YOUR self interest because otherwise we wouldnt have gotten to king (dont think we did anyways) so you wouldnt have gotten a scroll.<br>
<br>
I find it funny how you are calling people Iwantloot when you clearly only came to get loot from yourself.  You even said that when a raid was for someone to get their enchanter epic piece you left.  Don't believe in helping someone if it isnt for personal gain?  <br>
<br>
Last thing, I did forget a couple times to check the logs, then I rechecked and found nothing of a promise made.  I never promise someone loot unless the raid is directly for them.  If you have a screenshot or other proof send it to be, the ball has always been in your alley and best interest to actually prove I made a mistake.  <br>
<br>
Kelewala, you are being a total hypocrite saying that Iron and myself are in there for personal gain.  Nothing weve ever done has been for self gain, all the raids have been for others, and you are standing here telling everyone that if you werent considered for loot youd leave.  And who the @#%$ cares about exp on a raid, thats for newbies thank you.<br>

<br>
I am not fully clear on one thing, I thought that Kele was not in RE at the time he wanted the chanter piece, if that is the case and the loot was already given to a non-friend/non-guildy, then who can blame him for not wanting to come. If you want a non-guild member to come help you you should (out of common courtesy) provide some chance at a nice reward. If he was in your guild at the time then that changes everything.<br>
<br>
I fully believe that you (Gorn) are not in the raids for yourself, and I don't think anyone is accusing you of loot whoreing, what they are saying, and what looks to have some truth to it, is that Iron is a loot whore, and her influence is fuc<!>king up RE's loot distribution.<br>
<br>
My opinion does not really carry that much weight, because we are not good friends, and I know that, but all I am asking is that you step back and take a look at the interactions of your guild mates and see how they are directed. <br>
<br>
I am not trying to insult you, I am no trying to belittle you, I am just trying to provide another point of view, as reference, so that you might be able to see what is going on around you. <br>

In ToV my guild forces me to loot silk because I have passed so much that everyone else already has.  And you know what? I haven't turned a lot of it in yet because I still want to make sure I have no one that I can chain it to in my guild. <br>
<br>
As for exp groups on raids, I have no idea where you are getting that from.  If I was always in the exp group, I would have been 60 back in January.  Plenty of my guildmates had zoomed past me in levels.  Hell, been playing over two years now, only made level 60 two months ago and I am not even Baroness yet.<br>
<br>
At any rate, should I even reply to Zel? His post was about as out of line as the &quot;L60 druid&quot; thread was (that got deleted), and filled up to the top with lies.  Anyone who knows me, knows that I would not run off to someone as childish and unsuccessful as Zel (let alone go to such drastic measures just to 'keep him around') when I have such a good man like Gorn that I have been engaged to for a year now.  The real fact is that I have tried to get him away from me a few times, and now and then he would send me an IM trying to talk to me again.<br>
<br>
But why believe me? Just take a minute to talk to me in game, or see some of the things Gorn and I have actually done, talk to a lot of the people we have helped and guided along their own journeys in Norrath.  Look at the wonderful guild filled with giving people, that shot up rather quickly to be able to accomplish some difficult encounters in game.  Take a look at the leadership, all the officers, and the members.  If anything was as corrupt or screwed as people are presenting here, there would not even be this guild that I am describing.<br>
<br>

Why bohther, they are both public forums and it was brought up here, why take  the effort to move the discussion.<br>
<br>
And the subject of the thread is kind of exactly what this area of this message board was made for, this was not  an issue that needed to be brought to your guild's attention privatly, this was a rant and warning on the character of some of your members.<br>
<br>
And any warning should be spread amungst as many people as possible, which is done by using this board, not yours.<br>
<br>
Granted, on this board you get a lot of  unwanted opinions, like mine, but on the bright side, some of them are right (see above). <p><BR><BR>

The only ones that will complain about loot are the ones that I won't put up with bullshit.  The loot in my guild is not decided just by myself, or Ironlute, but by all council members.  If you want to accuse Ironlute, or myself of being loot whorish come up with some proof about it, instead of just saying we are.  Go ask my members if they feel that loot is given fairly, not just say &quot;I didnt get loot, therefore, Gorndax is a loot whore&quot;.  You fail to mention anything anywhere that deems myself or Ironlute as a loot whore.  What did they recieve?  How did they recieve it?  All you are doing is basing off the fact that YOU didnt get your way to get loot, and therefore, you are whining to the boards about not having such and such an item.  That is loot whoring at its best.  <br>
<br>
And sure you came out to raids, I kinda liked you at first.  Soon as I found out you were just in it to get items for yourself, and started shouting to zone how to do things, and causing problems with organizing I didnt want you anymore.  You are just bitter.  Remember, RE was a different RE way back then.  Most of our raids will still pickup raids.  I had LoM, LoF, RE and other p eople all having fun together, and your about the only person complaining about loot.  <br>
<br>
Btw Kelewala, going to other raids and helping out is good thing to do, but it doesnt give proof to anything about me promising you something, or that we are loot whores.<br>

<br>
Well i can provide this information...<br>
<br>
I'll just put the most obvious one. the skelly amulet from fear. The FIRST thing Gorndax said when it dropped was "Woohoo fatties get ready to random!!!!", everyone was so excited because it dropped, and thought randoming to fatties was the right thing so do. Well Iron must of went /crazy spazqueen on, and whined... next thing you see is "Gorndax says in shout, "well... Iron need the int so were just gonna give it to her...."... needs the INT?! go buy some jewelry. why did she receice it gorn? how was that decided? (this was also mentioned in the beginging of the thread by barrymore)<br>
<br>
guess what... i didnt want it, personally it should of gone to gurglespit, since him and only one other fatty (a shaman who could shrink herself), should of gotten it. i was more than happy with the one piece of loot i recieved being in RE and i never asked for any more, never got anymore /shrug. i hope you wake up gorn. i really think you're a good guy when you arn't tied to your rope.<br>
<br>
and for the record Gorn isnt a loot whore, i dont think i ever saw him get one piece of loot while i was a member), but i saw a lot of people get hurt in RE over something involving ironlute. <br>
<br>
but i guess it goes to show, if you dont like it leave<br>
<br>
damn it feels good to get that out, that case is one of the reasons why i left RE, and it was like a domino effect, stuff like this kept happening<br>
<br>
okay i'm done now<br>
/runs away<br>

BTW, if you really followed the charter you helped build for RE you wouldnt still be wearing the robe or the staff I gave you. Actually, Im still upset that I was the only one in guild that thought you should have the robe (everyone else said I was caving in) and you attack me about it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Considering I posted on 8/2 that we should let it alone, and then didn't post again until 8/18 . . . and then only two posts, to Willow and Kele about tangential subjects, methinks I haven't been bumping squat.<br>
<br>
Other people have been bumping the thread just fine for two and a half weeks without my help.<br>
<br>
However, since you brought up the robe again . . . we have two different recollections here.  As I recall, I received a barrage of /tells from people on the raid telling me, &quot;OMG, that's BS that he withdrew the random,&quot; and I then argued with you for about fifteen minutes in /tells about whether or nit it should be randomed.  By the end, the other casters who had entered the random had withdrawn, and the robe defaulted to me anyway.  All during this time I continued receiving tells from people asking if you had seen reason yet.<br>
<br>
In your version, you say that you felt I should have it all along.  That just doesn't wash with the fact that the random WAS withdrawn and you voiced that you instead wanted to SELL it for the guild coffers.<br>
<br>
Funny.  This sounds like an awful lot like what happened with the skellie amulet.  &quot;Fatties get ready to random,&quot; and then *boom* &quot;NM, I'm giving it to Ironlute.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gee.  Now I'm wondering . . . would the robe actually have been sold, or would it have wound up on Ironlute?  We'll never know, but . . . damn, I think the odds are pretty high.<br>
<br>
As for the bylaws . . . you and Ironlute never had a problem breaking them, so I don't feel any particular guilt over keeping the pieces I received while I was in the guild.  Not once since I left RE did you ever approach me to get them back.  There was a point at which I would have actually considered it, if I'd been approached in a calm fashion.  Not now, however.  It's been over six months and the statute of limitations on phat lewtz has expired.<br>
<br>
/hugs to Cham and Lixi.  I miss you guys.  Thanks for having the courage to post about your own experiences with the fun factory that is Iron and Gorn.<br>

<br>
And Barry, I really dont give a @#%$ about your robe.  In fact, by the rules you agreed to help made as a founding member of RE that you once displayed in your signature once you left the guild all guild property items should have been returned.  That was the robe and the VS staff I gave you (that you werent there for).  I never bothered you about it anyway.  <br>
<br>
As anyone that knows thats been a guild leader or a raid leader, none of your decisions will ever be met without some sort of resistance.  Everyone has different opinions and you try and make the decision thats best for the guild as a whole, without ticking off a large majority.  You caused a riot over a robe, and still hold a grudge against one decision I made.  I told you I thought it was best for the guild to get some guild funds, and that others thought it too. I also said that I gave it to you because I felt it be better you were happy than a few K in the bank, but, youd have to deal with people in the guild about it.  Im so glad my decision to let you have it was met with understanding *chuckle*.<br>
<br>
Now really kids, this is all pretty petty @#%$ here.  The majority of people that posted were in on time in RE that had left, been kicked out, or been given a decision to stay or leave and left.  Take your baggage with your because poking out from the woodwork to toss in ones ideas isnt going to make or break a guild.  I care all for my friends and my family and my guild, but really, I dont give a @#%$ about anyone that crosses the line.<br>

Get this through your head . . . I was receiving /tells from a TON of guildies during that whole scene, telling me they couldn't believe your actions.  You came about *this* close to losing half of RE right then, at that time.  And for the next few days . . . and every now and then for several months afterwards . . . I kept getting /tells from people in RE that said &quot;Good for you, I'm glad you fought for the robe.&quot;  I really felt like a million bucks!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm glad I had to deal with the guild about it; thanks, bucko.<br>

It's interesting; your story keeps changing.  You first claimed that this all happened on the same day I got the Robe of Benevolence, but it was in fact at least one full month later.  You claim that you wanted to give me the robe but others were arguing against it.  You then say that, yeah, you wanted to sell it for the guild coffers but then decided that keeping me happy was a better idea.<br>
<br>
But you have never once owned up to the fact that you announced the damn random and then changed the rules on everyone, on a piece that would have been an upgrade for almost every single pure caster that was on that raid.<br>
<br>
Dude, you and Ironlute made a wrong turn at the intersection between reality and la-la land quite a ways back.  I'm really amazed that you can keep deluding yourself in this way.<br>

Barry - must I remind you that the leadership of both our guilds said that any topics concerning EH/RE thing are not to be posted anymore? So why did you come back here suddenly to reply to Willow about it?  Don't you even listen to your friends?  Or did you ever plan on sticking to it?  More lies?<br>
<br>
Igota - Shut up.  For one - everything is a lie, but either way, even if there was NOT a lie, Zel still crosses a line when he tells the public about things that (supposedly) happened in RL.  Like I said, the L60 Druid thread got deleted, and why?  Because it had some graphic detail about a person's RL.  So why is Zel's post an exception? He made up some BS about me wanting to shoot myself over him, or something, you don't think that crosses a line?  I cannot say I pity you, but maybe I shall pity those around you in real life.<br>

other tidbits about Iron's whinyness:<br>

also commonly heard in guild chat was how EH &quot;stole&quot; RE's tactics for HoT, /laugh<br>

She also blabbed to a friend of mine who she did not know about the whole RE/EH issue, and how there was a banked sunstrike she didnt and how she was upset about that.  A complete stranger.  then she comes to these boards ragging on people about this being a private issue.....<br>

.... Yah, hypocrisy sucks and is a major pet peave of mine.<br>

No, i did not leave RE because i didnt get Item &quot;X&quot;.  I left primarily because of hypocrisy.  RE is run on the whims of Iron when she is online.  <br>
<br>
Right before i left silk robe #2 for the guild dropped, Iron was at awork.  At first it was going to be randomed to the Int casters there + iron.  then someone suggested that it just be given to Iron.  So gorn asks those in the random if they object.  What kind of a shitty thing to do is that, first you say, Oh yah you all have a chance.  Then you make them look like a &quot;loot whore&quot; (your definition) if they say no to it being given to iron w/no random.<br>
<br>
Then iron says she turns items down because others need them more.... some of RE's casters are wearing pretty shitty robes... yah....<br>
<br>
dare i say, more hypocrisy?<br>
