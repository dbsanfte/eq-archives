What Sony Doesn't Want You To Know<br>
<br>
<br>
 You guys have heard me ragging on Guides and GMs in the past few weeks, and really making fun of EQ Customer Service in general. However, I have a confession to make. I am posting this here as this in the one place I can assure Sony will not be able to have the post removed.<br>
<br>
For the past year and a half I have also been known as Guide Aislyn on the Tholuxe Paells server. Yes, your *cough* beloved *cough* guild leader was a Guide. Not only that, I proudly served as a Senior Guide for 3 months... before being demoted.<br>
<br>
Yes, you guessed it. I was demoted and removed as a guide because I will not keep my mouth shut when I feel something needs to be said, and not only said, but shouted from the roof tops. The subject I touch on here is one near and dear to my heart, and that is Customer Service to the players of EQ.<br>
<br>
When I was demoted and it got out as to why (I will go into this later) many asked why I was not removed. It was because of this very post. I just became a larger liability to the vaunted Powers That Be in SOE Customer Service. My gag is off and I will NOT be silenced. If you are from Sony and reading this post I ask you one thing and one thing only... prove me wrong. I rest assured that you will not.<br>
<br>
The whole thing came to a head the day I was promoted to Senior Guide. My birthday as a matter of fact. That was the day it was announced to the guides in the programme that servers would no longer have a GM assigned to them. We would hence be blessed with a roving band of GMs who would come and blast away the red petitions (GM only) and the customers would weep with their good fortune. Oh, players wept allright. They wept in frustration that it now takes a month to get an issue resolved, if it gets resolved at all.<br>
<br>
This is how it was supposed to work (and remember this was after they RIFed about 10 GMs) you would have a cluster of approximately 7 GMs who each had different responsibilities and two GM in this cluster who were just there for Guide Contacts to handle server issues. Each cluster has a Lead GM. These clusters were assigned to approximately 7 to 10 servers. And then there was one cluster dedicated to handle e-mail from the Contact Your GM link on the EQ site. GM Breave is the lead GM of this group and handles an ungodly amount of email. This lady gets work done.<br>
<br>
Well what happens? Servers are ignored for weeks if not months and players and guides begin to complain. Players are petitioning day after day with no resolution in sight. Finally they give up. GMs quit in frustration. The guide programme begins to hemorrhage at the rate of 10 guides per day. Senior Guides (the administrators of each server) begin to leave in unheretofore seen numbers. Each week we are told to hang on, things will get better, we just need to get used to the new system.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the Grading Team Chair, who is in charge of making sure the applications for a Guide Position are properly graded so that we continue to have incoming guides for the ones who retire is told by Brenlo and Ledian in Team Chair meetings that they cannot put a Help Wanted message in a MOTD on servers or in a Patch Message because... wait for it... the developers cannot work it in. Yes, evidently the developers of EQ, the most wonderous game online, who can create the wonders we daily experience, cannot put a TEXT MESSAGE into the numerous ones we witness, like today's ad for the EQ store. In my time as a Guide we went through 3 Team Chairs on the grading Team. But as it stands now, they have graders waiting for applications that Sony does not want coming in. Sony doesn't want new guides. They dont want a Guide Programme at all. No, free Customer Service for their product is a pain in the ass, and they will no longer support it. This is amazing considering that after Brenlo's major @#%$ up of spawning Ragefire for two whining guilds on another server got out and they put the shards to spwan Ragefire into the next patch post haste when other players noted how this was unfair. Amazing they can do that and yet not put up a text message. I stand in utter amazement.<br>
<br>
Thus begins the history lesson. Before EQ, 989 Studios/Verant had an online MMORPG that was a tank shoot 'em up. Not many people remember this game. The name isn't important (must not be, I can't seem to remember it myself), however, this fact is. When EQ beta testing was announced they dropped customer service on that product and let the game die. By the time EQ went client, the tank game was a fond memory (Kinda like Meridian59). Anyway, guess what was announced last month? SWG is going into bets testing. Guess what is getting @#%$ canned in EQ? You guessed it. The mental giants at Verant(SOE) decided they will kiss EQ goodbye because we're all going to SWG and EQ2.<br>
<br>
Now, who remembers Legends? Show of hands? Good. Legends was not a haven for the Uber at Heart. Legends is a marketing experiment. Once again you begin to see the light. Last month Brenlo announced there would be no Guide Programme for SWG. Guess what kind of Customer Service they will have there? You pay for premium service, say $40 a month and you get 24/7 Customer service. Any bells ringing yet? You don't pay for the premium service, then you can e-mail your complaint to someone who cares, only thing is, Verant/Sony isnt planning on hiring these caring individuals because they... cost money.<br>
<br>
When I drew this perilous, heretical parallel I was demoted from Senior Guide and given the opportunity to transfer to another server. Uh huh, yeah, right Elder Guide Jessla. I wasn't demoted for being a @#%$ all, do-nothing Senior Guide. I was demoted for touching on a TRUTH you don't want the public to know. And BTW, I own this board, so don't bother e-mailing me asking me to remove this post. I'll shove that missive so far up your ass you will be reading it from inside your stupid one glial celled head.<br>
<br>
Now, let me touch upon the ineptitude that resides at the highest echelons of Sony Customer Service. There are the employees of Sony, idiots like Brenlo, Mr. No Jessla and Agnieska are NOT Elder Guides because they lived in my house! And the volunteers, Like the Elder guides. Elder Semiconsious, as he is fondly referred to in the halls of SOE in San Diego, and Pending, then there are Jessla and Agnieska, two women who are so inept that a word has not yet been coined to sufficiently describe their stupidity. Jessla, in her infinite cluelessness actually locked a thread on the Common Hall (General Discussion Guide Board) written by a soldier in Germany who happens to be a Guide extolling the virtues of those who have given their life for the cause of freedom since 9-11. Yes, dangerous post, Jess. Seditious in it's very patriotic message. One Elder guide resigned after her attempts to get Agnieska and Jessla removed went nowhere. Her crime? She cared about the guide program and the players who would be effected by their stupidity.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you why the Elders hate me. Shortly after becoming a Senior Guide I made a post asking why, after 3 years, the Elder Guides had no policy in the Policy and Procedures regarding their accountability. Everyone is accountable to someone in the guide program, so why not them? I was basically given a song and dance routine reminiscent of Vaudeville, with one guide going so far as to say that this is not a democracy. I was also written up for inviting the Elders, all of them, to a Senior Guide meeting, which we held every other week to discuss issues, because it was &quot;sarcastic and degrading&quot;. My post was not either of these things. I mentioned that Jessla was the only Elder I ever witnessed and it did not seem fair to keep heaping all of our ire on her as she was not the only Elder Guide in the program. Another Senior Guide made another post saying the exact same thing mine did and he was not rebuked or in any other way reprimanded for his post. Selective reading? I think not. Jessla had Agnieska do this task as she was insulted and degraded by my invitation to the other Elders so she would not be beat up on all alone. I sometimes imagine her crying at her desk reading that post.<br>
<br>
Shortly before being made Senior Guide Brenlo told the senior guides that they would no longer be able to change first names and there was a programming snafu and only GMs would be able to do first name changes now. Two weeks later the Pay For a Name Change was announced. Brenlo admitted to &quot;misleading&quot; the Senior Guides and apologized. Great Mea Culpa Bixie. Shows how foreign that particular action is in your life. Since then the program has been losing guides and seniors at a fairly brisk clip.<br>
<br>
Guides are sick and tired of taking abuse from players because their GM Only issues never get resolved. Remember Darissa? She was also Sandpiper. A few weeks ago she quit the game, returning all the items I had ever given her. She had been a guide for a few months on the Povar server. She quit because of all the abuse she'd taken from the players. She found herself unable to even log in to play. She was a great guide. That's the kind of people they are running off. When I was a Senior Guide it was nothing to spend 30 hours offline handling administrative issues for my server. I was on ICQ nearly 24/7. My email box was constantly full. And I still managed to do 11+ hours a week online handling online issues. I was back guiding one week after my miscarriage because Senior Guide Glaiven told me I needed to get back to work. This is the kind of people they are running off.<br>
<br>
The question that stuck in my mind was why? Why run off their free customer support? Why did they keep kicking us when we were already down, nearly out?<br>
<br>
Premium Service baby. You're gonna have to pay to be ignored in SWG and EQ2. Bow down before the one you serve, Sony. You're going to get what you deserve.<br>
<br>
Thank you, but I will not ever slip into mediocrity to please others who worship at it's altars while trying to hide their Peter Priniciple. I'm out, glad Im out, and praying that someone pulls their head out of their ass and helps the dedicated guides and GMs who do this because, despite it all, they still think they can help players. Think about that next time you file a petition that never gets answered. Maybe they all got fed up and quit, and the GMs are all in a meeting listening to Brenlo talk about how great he is to have thought of the entire scheme while keeping all us mushrooms exactly where he wants us. <br>

<br>
As far as reasons?<br>
<br>
Paying the salary for half as many GMs increases profit margins. Period.<br>
<br>
They are not trying to get you to quit EQ to play EQ2 or SWG. They know that if people quit a game made by a company because of bad customer service that we are not going to try another game by that company.<br>
<br>
They did actually have a plan on paper that would theoretically actually improve customer service with fewer GMS. But the plan only worked on paper.<br>
<br>
SoE @#%$ up with the changes to the GM staff. We know it, they know it. <br>

only one thing to say..<br>
<br>
$13.oo a month x 470,000+ subscribers = one helluva profit margin per month allready. Period!<br>
<br>
If other companies can do it with less than that kind of revenue, why not this one?<br>

Isnt it actually Verant that is the problem? Or is it Sony? Seems like your saying Sony. If it IS Sony that does create a serious issue with people buying SWG.<br>

Some Manager somewhere probably designed the New CS plan saying look we can do more with less and got a nice bonus for it. The plan probably looked viable on paper. Pure numbers can lie.<br>
<br>
There is no conspiracy to make people quit EQ. <br>
<br>
EQ makes money. As long as it does, it will exist.<br>
<br>
SoE is not dumb enough to think 'hey if we piss our customers off they will buy more products from us.'<br>
<br>
By the time EQ2 is an option there will be other viable options out there. SoE will probably be doing alot to improve the way their customers see them so they will be returning customers.<br>

From what I hear, the turnover rate is pretty high for GM's. It's probably getting to be a very expensive exercise.<br>
<br>
Sony also probably keeps statistics on folks they don't get back to promptly and see that the customer is not lost. C'mon, if you are a drug dealer, and your customer service goes bad, folks may complain, but they won't abandon you...not if you have what they want.<br>
<br>
Also, I have used EQ CS more than any other CS for any other service during my lifetime. This is including petitions.

Profit</span><hr size=1> Profit ...<br>
<br>
now you have to ask yourself...why would you want to make even MORE profit on top of the 6.1M / month your allready pulling in... and include in that question, why would you do this when you could in fact alienate the customer base from which your profit survives by making such a decision? all in all possibly lowering your average monthly revenue. (Actually, more than a possibility, its almost 4 years, there will be a decline due to just pure monotony. If anything, they are providing the proverbial straw.)<br>
<br>
Business'es like to put a product out in a 'window'. One which will generate fan-faire, as well as sales. Its a common practice and is why a lot of companies have  dead-lines to meet. Usually the dead-lines are predicted windows which will give them the most fan-faire which equates to potential sales which in turn equals revenue.<br>
<br>
Now VI (or SoE) has an opportunity. Not just to hit the market in the window to get the fan-faire, the press, and sales..(games, the window I think would be around christmas..I could be wrong..when do most new titles get released? ), but the ability to generate that window.<br>
<br>
They, per se, allready control most of the MMORPG market, with AO and DAoC in a second. But even most who play/played the latter two have more than likely played EQ.<br>
Not 100%, but most.<br>
<br>
So from a business standpoint, it would be wise to kinda 'lean' on the customer base to purchase these new titles, as CD sales are a nice profit margin out of the gate. (which if good enough, the sales could take care of the cost of many of the new servers / overhead).<br>
<br>
If they piss the customer off too much, not much of a threat if they time that window.<br>
<br>
There will be other titles to pick, yes, but when...<br>
<br>
..ShadowBane (but only god...wait dun think he(hrmm and/or she, so that dont get pointed out later on<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) knows when that will be released.)<br>
<br>
WoW, but thats gonna be a while (should be worth it though..)<br>
<br>
Horizons..maybe?<br>
<br>
SWG &amp; EQ2 (both controlled by the same company)<br>
<br>
Did I miss any other major players?<br>
<br>
Im sure their marketing team (just like with any other company) knows this.<br>
<br>
So now you see the competition. They are in fact their own biggest competitors. (I personally think WoW would be their largest competitor, but blizzard takes their time)Of course its in their best interest to phase it out, slowly.<br>
<br>
Computer manufacturers do it all the time why not them?<br>

For a while it was a case of Verant ran EQ and Sony just umbrella'd it.   However Sony has since taken a much more active role in the goings on of it's babies and in many cases verant may have some say, but the umbrella became a leash and Sony calls much of the shots. <br>
<br>
Remember also that Sony is pushing EQ to the PS platform which does NOT join with the PC version (there is also a MAC version coming so not sure where that fits in).   So Sony is spreading their efforts out quite a bit.<br>

I actually wanted to try SWG out. <br>
<br>
But all other issues aside including all the BS on this board, the reason I stopped<br>
PLAYING was Verant. Even when I caught a GM dead to rights in cheating<br>
(openly favoring a Guild with BOTH a repop, AND granting free items)<br>
I called Verant and bitched. You guessed it, I got a warning for my effort.<br>
They didnt give a damn what the GM did. They dont want to hear about it.<br>
I swear a GM could start killing players and Verant would not do a damn thing.<br>
<br>
It simply isnt worth playing if your reward is watching other players get XP patched.<br>

Everything in the entertainment industry tends to have large markups so that when it becomes a success it makes a huge profit, what most people forget is that for every success there are many failures that lose alot of money. So the large profit margins of EQ are also bankrolling all the failed games they lost money on, all the failed ideas that never even made it to the consumer idea, and all the games that currently are in development (EQ2, SWG, etc...). There is nothing evil about all this, its the same thing any other company out there does. If they didnt do it, they would have stagnated and died off long ago. <p><center><i>He's got the Eye of Fatima on the wall of his room<br>
