Bullshit.<br>
<br>
The abuse of Need before greed was non existant.<br>
<br>
Want to fix the fuckheads that abuse need before greed. Name names.  100% of the problem with need before greed looting is simple. East bay commons.  You get fucking &quot;traders&quot; that can make a profit by screwing over people in groups. They have mules. And trader accounts. And due to profit will screw over anyone they can. <br>
<br>
Want to fix it. Find out who they are muling for. Or stop paying outragous prices for gear. Take away thier rep or thier profit motive and the abuse will slow.<br>
<br>
Use a little bit of accountabilty. If you get some greedy bastard who is calling need before greed 3 weeks in a row in Karnors and loots 4 sets of gloves then call his ass out.<br>
<br>
There are 2500 people on E marr at primetime. Chances are there are only 3 steps between anyone on the server.  (As in I know someone that knows someone.) Start talking.<br>
<br>
Oh and if some stupid motherfucker thinks that they are going to random a tigirs spell when it drops when Snoww is in a group then they have another thing coming. If you make exceptions for spells  then you have to make exceptions for gear too.<br>
<br>
Need before greed isnt the problem. The problem lies in the greedy fucks that abuse it.<br>

<br>
A head piece droped, with 12 AC, 3 int/wis.<br>
<br>
That was a very nice improvement over what I had before but the warrior said she needed it, so we rolled.<br>
<br>
What she previously had on her head had 17 AC, so one could wonder why a war would need int and wis...<br>
<br>
Just for laughs, I asked her about one hour later why she did not have it on her head, she said oops and changed it. I had my laughs right there. Obviously the next day she had a former helm back on, and for some reason she has lost that day any respect I could have for her.<br>
<br>

<br>
Explain that to me and I'll concede your point.<br>
<br>
I love the idea of being fair but as Zoldarf put it above <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As it stands, melees are entirely dependant on dropped gear, so we'd generally preffer NBG.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Most mellee benefit from NBG over casters so of course it's a big argument supported by mellee.<br>
<br>
Do people honestly believe that if casters were more dependant on gear then mellee classes that roles wouldn't be reversed?<br>
<br>
Things are changing and unfortunately it's not good. Luvia NBG is not a gamewide method, its something that started on some server that was heralded as a good idea. Then you get tanks everywhere hearing about it and screaming how it must be applied. There are a lot of servers where this is considered selfishness and some where it got adopted. I remember playing in August of 1999 and NBG was the tried and tested principal of guilds. It just got corrupted.<br>
<br>
NBG isn't going to be fair as long as its abused. It's fine for groups of players who group with each other on a regular basis and it's fine for guilds. In these cases its rarely cheated.   <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
And as far as casters not being as dependent on dropped loot, that's just horseshit.  I did a naked CR down to Koro about a month ago and I was shocked at my mana pool without my gear, SHOCKED.  Gear matters, to everyone.<br>
<br>
As far as casters being able to buy gear from vendors (what, a cloth hat? what decent gear can casters by from vendors) or jewelcraft, by the time casters hit the upper 50s they are trading in velium rose quartz rings for knotted turtlebone rings, etc.  Jewelcraft items (barring BD) are not &quot;end game&quot; items for casters, they depend on drops, JUST LIKE A MELEE.<br>
<br>
I will abide by whatever rules a group has determined for loot (remember kiddies, always decide loot rules BEFORE loot drops) but would always prefer NBG.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 866<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/9/02 10:47:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2888.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG is BS!</span><hr size=1> No I think that statement is right Glori to an extent. Your mana pool may have been significantly reduced but a warrior, sk, pal, ranger without equipment is going to get toasted.<br>
<br>
However that war, pal, sk, ranger is still going to get wasted if the cleric is out of mana, or the nukers stop nuking.<br>
<br>
When I join a group I ask what the loot rules are and I abide by them. When I start a group I ask the people what they want to do and I follow those rules and I stick to them. I don't think I can be any fairer.<br>

I've said it before Ill say it again the idea of NBG is fantastic and idealistic but bad apples spoil it for everyone.<br>

<br>
My point is that abusers will have to become more overt to get thier phat lewt that they feel they deserve more than anyone else. They will find ways around it (i.e running hack progs like show eq and trianing your group to kill the mob and lewt without your knowledge) or other such diabolical means.<br>
<br>
This will affect the mood of the game in my view. I left the game for 8 months during the overcrowding before the Kunark release because <br>
<br>
A. It was becoming too hard as a part-timer to get in group B. Because lewt arguements and group suspicion became a very real part of the game.<br>
C. Well I had this thing called RL<br>
<br>
I personally do not want to have to watch all my group members with suspicion. With NBG I dont do that. If I need an Item I get it. I don't cheat anyone, I demand the same treatment and it seems fair to me. There have also been plenty of items that I have already had and I have seen lots of casters get that and that is cool too.<br>
<br>
So if you want to personalize my arguement against NBG you can label me a Melee ( Who according to you benefits more from NBG) and a Part Time player (Who benefits more from NBG). Makes the game much more playable for me with the time I have.<br>
<br>
However the spirit of NBG is something special and refreshing in my view. We gonna just let the phat lewt whores rule our world or what? Cause that's what we are doing when we say NBG sucks. I agreed before with many of the posters here and I still do. It's the phat lewt whores fault not NBG's.<br>

<br>
The relative importance of melee gear compared to caster gear is reflected exactly where you'd expect it to show up in a free-market economy: prices.  I could walk into the ec tunnel any day of the week a pick up great caster gear for not much cash.  Ask yourself: how long have you been using your stein of moggok, and how much did you pay for it?  Used it for 30 levels? 40 levels? 50+ levels?  And you probably paid 200plat for it.  200plat would buy me a kick in the nuts.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it's fair... if anything I'd probably say it's poorly designed.  Tanks/melees have an unlimited thirst for AC/damage output, but a caster's mana pool is capped.  Int becomes less useful after a certain point, but AC never does.  Int items can be purchased from a jewelcrafter, AC items (decent ones) can not.  I can hardly think of a dropped piece of caster jewelry better than something that can be bought from a skilled jeweler, with the exception of uber loot.  Anyone wearing those moonstone rings from the frenzy in lguk? Didn't think so...<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I'm biased towards NBG.  But all loot systems are fair if they are decided ahead of time, and strictly enforced.  Scammers suck, and should be exposed.  <br>

Need Before Greed is a flawed system, that allows, even PROMOTES greed, and abuse of the system. You don't leave your money lying around, because it can be stolen, and you don't leave the chance for loot waving in the face of someone who plays a computer game 10 hours a day, and expect them not to abuse it. It just reeks of naivety (sp?)<br>
<br>
Anyone who promotes a system that enables cheating to transpire is promoting cheating in itself. <br>
<br>
As long as FFA cannot be cheated at, it's the only fair source, in pick-up groups. Just on a personal opinion, 6 people kill something, 6 people spend hours in a group killing monsters, all contributing, but only one person reaps the reward? Not to mention that caster gear often drops from un-popular hunting areas, and is grossly outweighed by melee drops.<br>
<br>
One of these days you guys need to open your eyes. And giving it to a guild to get an invite? Oh yea, cheating and bribery, that's a great set of morality. Lets not get invited off our personalities, but more of what loot we can bring to the table.<br>

I play need before greed in every group. Or maybe I should say Use it and it is yours.  I have no problem giving an Item to someone if they are going to use the item. I have a huuge problem giving an item to someone if they are going to demand they are going to use it, then East bay commens it. If they win a roll fair and square then bully for you. It is cash loot. <br>
<br>
But know this. Any group I am in, and I run most of em, cash loot is randomed, but once you win you are out. The best way to do the loot that I have found in Pile it up and roll for the cash loot at the end, but sadly in this day of camps and non groups people don't crawl anymore. they sit in one spot and recycle members.  This benifits the Random everything person, because the greedy fucks are dual boxing and passing off as two differant people, then getting 2 chances on items. then once they both win one leaves takes the items and hands off to a mule. Then they go back and levrage more items from the random everything crowd.<br>
<br>
Notice how no drop items are all need before greed. Why?<br>
<br>
NO FUCKING PROFIT!  <br>
<br>
Get one and move on. Or stay and help others get thiers if they are fun and decent players.<br>

The whole price check mentality just sickens me. The whole I am a trader thing sickens me. I have handed off so many items with a simple &quot;Help me in the future if you can.&quot;<br>

People are charging 50K for torpor. 50K!  Not for anything but a spell. A spell that I would use to save your life if I had. But I won't have it. Why?  Because of greedy fucks.<br>

NBG is only good when you have a group of guildies or friends. This thread fails to point out whether or not these are pick up groups or guilds, or what ever. If it is a guild or friends, then NBG works wonders, you can actually trust the people. In a pick up group, I am going to take the side of the random. I don't know you, why the hell should I trust you? Spells should be given away if not needed, and loot should be rolled for. It's sad that the l3wt whores have made it come to this, but for god's sake, you can't trust anyone. <p><center><table width=350 border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

But we don't have to, the basic laws of economics have taken care of all this for us.  Supply and demand.  At every level of the game, equivalent level caster gear is less expensive than melee gear.  I recognize that level 60 spells can cost 10k, and that an orb of the infinite uberness will set you back a lot of cash too.  I'm not saying all caster gear is cheap, just that it's relatively cheap.  I think this is a fair observation.<br>
<br>
Even the example you gave with the hero bracer supports this proposition:  If it is as you said, the &quot;melee equivalent of the stein of moggok&quot;, why does it cost over twice as much as the stein?  There must be a reason.  Heck, the bracer is only useable by medium races too, if I recall.  So if the bracer is 500pp and the stein is 200pp, either:<br>
<br>
A) There are 2.5 times as many steins as bracers.<br>
<br>
B) There are 2.5 times as many medium sized melees as int casters<br>
<br>
C) The bracer is 2.5 times more valuable to a melee than the stein is to a caster...<br>
<br>
D) some combination of the above<br>
<br>
If caster gear is so wildly important, why is it so much cheaper?<br>
<br>
As for spells, yes, they're mob-dropped after 50.  They're also cheap as dirt to buy in ec until you get to around level 55.  But speaking as a warrior who's had to live off mob drops ever since I upgraded the leather armor I bought at level 8: casters have it kind of good for the first 50 levels, buying from their guildmaster.  I am not insensitive to the problems involved in scrounging up high level spells, but melees scrounge for gear their entire existance.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, only once casters have to start freeing up slots for resist gear does it become critical to have the best stuff available. All end-game stuff is wildly expensive... nothing new here.<br>

I've NEVER been in a group where a cleric casting Symbol of Whichever (the one that uses the expensive peridots) hasn't been given enough cash loot to cover costs of peridots.  Hell most of the time if we're FFA looting all the regular crap (mostly in KC, tend to have someone MLing whenever I've been in OS and giving the cleric a goodly share of the cash loot before everyone starts getting some) I personally have given away gems and jewellery items to the cleric if I know they've been casting symbol.<br>
<br>
K here's some stuff bout me, I'm a bard and probably 80% of my gear is no drop so I can't offer it up for random anyways.  Does a bard count as a melee class??  Well either way I support NBG as a looting system, or at least the theory of NBG as in you ask to have Item_01 defaulted to you (or rolled for only by those who can / will use it) that dropped because it is an upgrade and you will use it.  I absolutely NEVER call NBG on an item I won't use either a wearable upgrade to a current piece or for any special effects it has, if I won't use the item I won't call NBG on it (selling the item DOES NOT count as a use when we're talking NBG).<br>

<br>
Also, I regularly hunt in places like KC and OS and in all the times I've grouped there I don't actually think I've EVER won ANYTHING!!! using the NBG method.  For example when I hunt in KC I'm often in the Cappy room, only bard useable item I can think of that drops there is a Jade Mace but I can 100% guarantee if one drops in my presence (may already have seen one drop but can't remember) I won't be calling NBG for it because <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I don't need it</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> so I'd say random 1 - 6.  And likewise in OS I've spent a lot of time at Necrosis and yes I was there when a CSS dropped which I'm sure most people would say is an ok bard weapon (has CHA and other ok stats) and I've never owned a CSS in my life so potentially I could've call NBG on it, but hey guess what I didn't .. as I recall someone may have suggested it go to me but I said nah I'd just sell it as I don't need it so alpha random it instead. <br>
<br>
Like I said in the beginning of this thread and as a lot of others have said.. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NBG isn't the problem, it's the loot whoring profit-mongers that are the problem...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I'm sure given time they would find a way of scamming FFA randoming too if that was the more widely used method, hell I've heard stories and have been in groups where I'm pretty certain that one person is playing 2 accounts.  If that happened in an FFA roll then 1 person has double the chance of winning an item.<br>
<br>
I guess I shall carry on getting groups in places where items I don't need / can't use drop and calling NBG as a loot policy and thus screwing myself out of the 1 in 6 chance of getting an item to sell.. but at least I'll have my dignity and honor as I know I won't ever be calling a NEED for an item if I honestly won't use it and plan to secretly sell it soon as poss afterwards.  But I will for sure be ousting anyone I am sure of who is abusing the NBG system.<br>
<br>
