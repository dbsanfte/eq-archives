<br>
I hate to stoop down to your level of name calling as it makes me no better than you, but I can't seem to help myself in this case. You are a MORON (or Moran <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) of the 1st degree. Do you even read, let alone comprehend, any of what I have said? Here...I will use little sentences and small words-<br>
<br>
1. I do not agree with what Ibiar said. I have said this already. As Zendell said, things are being done about it in guild. Just because we don't keep YOU updated doesn't mean nothing is being done.<br>
<br>
2. You are right. I don't know 100% that Ibiar is not Mors. But knowing him in game and in RL I think our guild (95% who are RL friends and work together) are more able to judge whether he is Mors or not than YOU are. Hell, your mother could be Mors, but I am not going to point fingers until I hang out with her a bit.<br>
<br>
3. You have a traceable history of accusing ppl to be hiding under another nick. That hints of obsession and paranoia to me. (Doesn't matter how many other ppl do it, too. We're talking about YOU.) As I have already said, if some schmuck came in here and started posting crap and someone else claimed it was a sheep in Raedwolf's clothing, I would just as vehemently (oops, sorry...big word)...strongly defend you...or atleast call for concrete proof. Thus my &quot;thoughtless&quot; and &quot;lockstep&quot; response.<br>
<br>
It's ppl like you who point fingers at anyone that doesn't automatically repudate the accused, that is the real tragedy during these sad times. Last time I looked it's still America, and that means &quot;innocent until PROVEN guilty&quot;. It's ppl like you who are beating up supposed GUILTY &quot;Muslims&quot; in America mearly because of the color of their skin and the turban on their head. It's ppl like you who are too busy holding moral court to see that not everyone is the enemy just because they don't think like you think (and I'm not speaking of Mors but EVERYONE you have bashed without proof of their duplicity).<br>
<br>
Feel free to write what you want (and you will..God Bless America), but I am done with this subject, with you, and with posting on this thread. If anyone else feels the need for additional clarity of my statements feel free to write to emberial@hotmail.com since I'm not gonna check this thread anymore. I don't guarantee a response.<br>

Since you are fond of pointing out grammatical errors, it is THEN not THAN.  That isn't the reason for me quoting this, but I felt compelled to point it out since I love irony.  As for the reason I DID quote this...  <br>
<br>
I just wanted to make something abundantly clear, you have very few things that were NOT given to you by God, your ignorance is one, and your love of eliciting responses from others with provocation is another.  I hope some day you realize the stupidity of being Agnostic, if you can explain all the scientifically unexplained properties of life without bringing God into it I would love to see you try.  As for needing Jesus, I don't think EVERYONE needs Jesus, I think that those who actively seek redemption and salvation need Jesus.  God and Jesus give you the OPTION of whether you want to accept them or not, if you don't want to, fine, that is your choice, your &quot;GOD GIVEN&quot; ability to make the choice.  Renounce them if you wish, but don't expect salvation, and seriously don't expect to go to heaven when you die if you turn your back on your creator.<br>

I fear the reason you know where to get butt plugs buddy, and I fear the reason why you wish to get some in the shapes of religious figures.  Yes, you will die if you are in a plane hit by a building, and I will not tell you otherwise.  The question is, what will happen to you once you are dead.  You think that the peace of mind that Christians gain is all self manufactured, but as I have stated above, there is nothing good that is self-manufactured and this is no exception.  We gain peace of mind because we KNOW that we shall be rewarded for our faith and our acceptance of the love of God in heaven when we leave this mortal shell we call our life.

1) The &quot;man who doesn't get any pussy&quot; that you refer to is a man who has chosen to remain celibate in order that he can be pure enough to speak the word of the Lord.  If I were a lesser person I would have something to say to you about this comment, though I cannot bring myself to stoop low enough to say it.<br>

2)  He isn't telling you how to live your life, he is telling you how God WANTED you to live your life.  You can choose to live whatever way you want, it seems you choose to live yours as flame bait.<br>

No, he doesn't.  He ASKS for your generosity in the form of a donation to keep the church running so that he can continue to save souls.  You aren't going to hell unless you refuse God, and I'm sorry to say this (hey, I'm human I can't help it), even you can get into heaven if you accept salvation.<br>

Those unfortunate children are comforted almost daily by men and women who believe in God and Jesus and do what they can to ease the child's suffering.  In that regard they ARE being watched over.  &quot;For man does not live by bread alone, but by the word of God.&quot;- Jesus, care of the bible.  However, what puts the children in those positions?  Could it be the self-serving non-religious men such as your self who care for nothing and no one?<br>

<br>
Actually, you poor unfortunate soul, Jesus came to give salvation to the Jewish people, but they made the choice not to accept him.  It was their choice, however, as God had given them the choice.  It was the Romans who actually killed Jesus, but that again was part of God's plan.  To send his son who had never sinned to die for the sins of all men.  As for damning Jews for creating a cult, they didn't create Christianity, God did, and I do not wish them damned, I wish them saved, as I wish all people saved, but I cannot and will not force anyone to believe, God didn't want that.<br>

I love the way you continue your cycle of lack of anything resembling tact or political correctness here.<br>
<br>
1)  The only population control I believe is appropriate, is revoking the right to let people that show this much lack of intelligence and total apathy towards the human race the right to breed.  Better yet, isolate people showing this level of apathy and keep them from interacting with humanity so that their views of life and the world will die with them.<br>
<br>
2)  I will not pretend to have any idea what your quote truly depicts, I revel in my innocence at this point.  NOTE: Innocence, not ignorance.  Innocence means &quot;free from guilt or sin.&quot;  Ignorance means &quot;resulting from or showing lack of intelligence.&quot;<br>

Yep, read and understood what you posted.  I responded point by point.<br>
<br>
2.  Your decision to keep your chastisement of Ibiar (accepting your word that such has taken place) to your own board is your choice.  Frankly, that seems pointless to me.  He's dirtied your guild's name by his conduct.  Some public distancing from his comments (which you guys have finally made, sorta) would seem to be appropriate.<br>
<br>
3.  Your silly labelling of me regarding the witchhunts and stereotypes is ludicrous.  We've had a rash of anonymous flames lately.  I've been trying to stamp it out.  I also happen to read the board and post a lot.  The dupes have primarily had as their source either fools and trolls trying to say something vile or inflammatory without reprisals, or its been folks posting in support of a comment made by someone trying to lend credibility to the other.  Several of those that have been accused have been outed by Ogmuk as doing exactly as accused.  You can't really consider it a witchhunt when the accused is convicted and/or confesses.  And it is relevant that others have made the same accusation, as it suggests its not paranoia but an actual condition.<br>
<br>
4.  Significant evidence points to Mors = Ibiar.  a.  The &quot;population control&quot; comment was made by him in DL.  b.  The nick's description is identical between the two accounts.  c.  Ibiar has rationalized and justified Mors statements on more than one occasion in this thread.  d.  EZBoard isn't limited to EQ, so the fact that the Mors account was allegedly created before Ibiar started playing is not persuasive.  e.  Zen doesn't know the IP details of Mors account, so his insider info isn't meaningful, and easily masked (especially by someone that used to work for an ISP).<br>
<br>
5.  Fine, you are all bent that I thought Mors was Ibiar.  I have now come to the conclusion that it is unlikely.  Still possible, but unlikely.  Frankly, its irrelevant to any of the things I've said about Ibiar or y'all.  It shows poor judgment on your part not to distance yourselves from his comments in your first posts rather than running over to defend him.  Any guild that would keep him as an officer is not a guild with which most folks would want to associate.<br>
<br>
6.  As for name-calling, whatever.  How can you &quot;stoop&quot; to my level by doing something I haven't.  Knights of Wackiness sorta had a ring to it and a decent way of grouping you and Zen together to respond to your &quot;defense&quot; of Ibiar and is hardly name-calling.  If you think that was a flame, then you are WAY too sensitive and should go back to hiding in the little corner y'all have created for yourselves.  As the two of you are leaders of the guild, it seemed appropriate, too.  I called Mors a pinhead regarding his Pearl Harbor and other analogies.  Haven't called anyone else a name.  Not my style.  I've labelled actions as foolish, but that's not the same thing.<br>
<br>
P.S.  I like your pic.  It's pretty funny/clever.  Zen's sig quote is good, too.  Too bad my first contact with you folks was over the idiotic things being said by Ibiar and Umbrae. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/15/01 5:54:05 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/cybiades/celli.jpg width=106 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yay!</span><hr size=1> Mors...<br>

Thanks for your concern, but really it's misplaced. Don't worry about &quot;saving us,&quot; we are doing OK on our own. I know your religion teaches you to go out and spread the word, but if you ask Jews what one thing they really want, It's to be LEFT ALONE. That's all.

Yay for you for stamping out all anonamous flames.

Of course every guild in Everquest would immediately remove any member for having his own opinion on things.  Also this sounds strangely like guilt by association.  Also, don't assume what most folks would want to associate with.  Of course I would totally leave an exp group because someone who has an opinion I disagree with joins.

<br>
And if I was to use your way of thinking I would:<br>
<br>
1. Call you names, then deny it in a later post.<br>
2. Think of a clever renaming/flame of your guild (if you are in one) and say it was appropriate based on your actions.<br>
3. Not associate with ANYONE in your guild (again if you are in one) unless they came here to publically distance themselves from you.<br>
<br>
I do not know if you are an officer of your guild, nor do I care, it is my opinion that officers simply have more responsibilty to work on things for the guild rather than more responsibilty to improve their faction with Raedwulf.<br>
In fact I do not even know if you are in a guild since you do not state you are, but your knowledge of what guilds should do makes me think you are in one. <br>

What made me think he was not trying to convert you was the statement that he cannot nor would try to make you believe.<br>

I interpreted the part about Jews being saved as them accepting and loving their God.  However I can see how it can and may have very well been meant a different way.<br>
<br>
I agree if you are Jewish and have accepted and follow your deity that is what I thought was meant.  If it was meant another way, then yes I understand why you would say that as most people of ANY religion do not wish to be converted.<br>
IF my ignorance of the Jewish religion is obvios from this post please enlighten me since I do not know a lot about it.  I probably should talk to my Jewish friends more about it, although I tend to avoid religious discussions unless I know they will end positively.<br>

Many Christians believe that they can try, and that in fact it is their duty to try. From your statement, I think you understand why many Jews (any non-Christian really) would be moderately annoyed by this. In no way did I see the Aphro post as an attempt to convert anyone. I was just pointing out the statement in it referring to a Christian doctrine that annoys many. I'm sure I'm over-sensitive to it somewhat, seeing as how I live in the south and am surrounded by many &quot;Bible-beaters.&quot; I didn't mean to say I spoke for all Jews, but I doubt there are many who enjoy trying to be converted. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
