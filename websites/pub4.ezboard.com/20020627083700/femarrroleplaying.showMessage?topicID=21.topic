The high-elf was far away in the Butcherblock Mountains, and needed a speedy return to the Freeport area.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien, a former member of the Order of Ascension, never questioned when one of it's members was in need of his services. The druid sat and opened his spell book. He flipped through the worn pages of the old tome searching for the spells that allowed the druid to open portals through alternate planes of existance. These portals would allow Lenuvien to reach the far away dwarven lands in mere moments, instead of the days of travel it would normally take.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, this is it.&quot;, Lenuvien said outloud as he found the incantation he needed. Lenuvien memorized the spells in just a few minutes. The half-elf stood and put his spell book in his pack. He then began casting. Swirls of light and smoke began to surround the druid and he slowly faded into the void.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien appeared at the druid circle - one of the many monuments left by his ancestors to aid in the channelling of the travel magic. It was important that the destination be clearly visible in the casters mind, lest he or she end up sticking out of the ground. Lenuvien had seen it happen before, and it was all but certainly a fatal mistake. This, of course, is why younger druids are not permitted to study the travel magics.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien gathered his wits after the journey, and determined the direction of the cross-roads. He had travelled this land many times before, and had no problems remembering the way. He called upon the wolf spirits to assist him in reaching his destination quickly. The druid ran off at unatural speeds towards the crossroads. In his haste, Lenuvien failed to notice he was being watched. As he ran past the mysterious undead tower that was along the way, he was jumped from behind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bandits! Damn!&quot; Lenuvien, being well experienced in battle, managed to twist around as the evil dwarf's dagger just started to penetrate his tunic. Lenuvien whinced at the pain for a moment as the blade started to dig into his flesh, and ripped open a large wound. As Lenuvien spun, he swung the blade of his scimitar around to cut the foolish dwarf's stomach. It was not a deep wound, but the magic blade of the weapon caused the flesh to open as if gutting a fish. The dwarf stumbled backwards attempting to move out of the way of the strike. He quickly regained his balance, though, and gained a strong stance.<br>
<br>
The druid knew the butcherblock bandits had a contract out on him, as he had headed up an assault on them with Byzar Bloodforge many months ago. The assault had cost the bandits dearly, and they vowed to kill all that had been involved. More than likely there were others near by, so he had to act quickly. Lenuvien called once again upon the very roots in the ground to hold his foe still while he prepared a more powerful magic. As the druid finished speaking the incantation, fear was evident in the dwarf's eyes. Although shuning magic, the dwarves were aware of it's awesome powers. As if someone had thrown a Tumpy Tonic in the camp fire, flames suddenly shot up from were the dwarf stood, totally engulphing him. He had no chance at escape, and cried out before dropping to the ground, smoke still rising from his body.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien took no pleasure in ending the life of another, but he knew it was necessary. He searched the corpse for anything of value, but found just a few coins. He then checked his wounds. Finding them to be minor, he used an old magic spell he had learned while very young to close the wound. He did not heal himself totally, however, as the magics he was about to call upon to help his friend travel to the western commonlands outside of Freeport would surely tax him.<br>
<br>
The druid began his run again. He was not far from where Fyndolyn would be waiting. As he approached the guard post at the crossroads, he saw Fyndolyn's shiny, golden armor reflecting the sunlight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tunare must be proud to have such a noble knight in her service&quot;, Lenuvien thought. He had fought beside Fyndolyn in years past, and found him to be a most valiant warrior. He missed the days when he travelled with his friends from the Order. Alas, he had to leave to devote himself to his studies back in Surefall Glade. He wanted nothing more than to do Tunare's work while serving in the Order, but he was drawn to learn the mystic knowledge held by so few that would allow him to travel the face of Norrath instantly. He decided to leave the Order, and return to his studies in the serenity of the Glade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, my friend!&quot;. Fyndolyn's greeting drew the druid back to Butcherblock from his thoughts. &quot;It is good of you to have come on such short notice, and so far.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is an honor to assist you again, my friend. How have you faired recently?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am well. There is much to share with you, but I am sorry to say I haven't the time to sit and drink, and talk of things that have come to pass. I must get to Freeport without delay!&quot;<br>
<br>
Lenuvien nodded in understanding. &quot;Perhaps we will meet again soon, and we can get caught up. Now, gather near. Please give me a moment to concentrate, as this spell is most difficult.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand.&quot; Fyndolyn moved to within a few feet of the druid, and stood quietly, waiting for the mystical portal to open so that he could step through.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien began to cast. The energies pulled from all living things withing a few yards of the druid. The wind began to spin around him, causing the leaves to get caught up in the air. Flashes of lightning sparked around the two elves, and jumped to nearby trees. Suddenly, with a loud burst of thunder, a magical portal opened before the druid. Lenuvien held the portal open, while signaling for Fyndolyn to step through. The high elf did step in, and Lenuvien followed. With one final crack of thunder, the portal closed.<br>
<br>
It was a strange experience inside the void between the planes of existance. Light twisted and swirled around as if falling through a great tunnel. There was a strong feeling of vertigo. No sound could be heard. It was as if time itself was stopped. Far off in the distance could be seen a bright light, growing ever closer. Suddenly, as the light rushed up to meet them, they stepped through and found themselves in the western commonlands. Lenuvien pondered for a moment how much more powerful this magic was than the ones that allowed him to travel alone across the expanses. He had harnessed the power several months ago, but was still in awe of it.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien immediately sat to rest. The travel had exhausted him. Fyndolyn looked at the druid, a look of understanding.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thank you again, my friend. I will get word to you soon. We must speak.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fyndolyn paused a moment as Lenuvien looked up at him from his resting spot.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, Len, the Order's doors are always open to you. If you ever wanted to come back...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ah, how he wanted to come back. He missed his friends greatly. But, he knew his training was not yet complete. There was more to learn. He didn't know what to do.<br>
<br>
The druid didn't comment further, unsure of what to say. He stood up and bowed to his friend. &quot;I look forward to hearing from you. Take care, Fyndolyn.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, Fyndolyn took leave of the druid. Lenuvien sat back down, still exhausted from the spell. He looked on as Fyndolyn ran off into the distance towards the great city of Freeport.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien spent the next few hours sitting there, pondering what he should do. His soul was torn.<br>

During those times in the Order, life was simpler and the Madness had not taken it's stranglehold upon Norrath as of yet.<br>
<br>
A warm breeze buffeted the cleric as he ran, and a scent visited his nostrils.  Fyndolyn stopped dead in his tracks.  &quot;What..? Where..? where is that..*sniff*  No, it could not be.  It must just have been triggered by the visit with Len.&quot;  Fyndolyn could have almost sworn that was the scent of his dear friend, Myrran Ti'nor.  Long ago lost to her family in the Order, she was one of the first to fall to the evil that housed itself in the Lord General  Tynkale.  But that is another story.<br>
<br>
The cleric reached behind his breastplate and withdrew the crystal amulet.  He grasped it firmly.  He had given Myrran an identical one during her flight from the hordes of Tynkale's men, that with it's magic she might stay in touch with him and let him know how she faired.  He would tell her when it was safe to return.  After that day, the amulet never pulsed to let him know she was still there.  He missed her presence deeply.  A single tear began it's descent over the priest's weathered cheek.<br>
<br>
He continued his run for Freeport.  His mind thinking back to moments before, when issuing the invitation to join with the Order once more, he recalled offering once before in much the same manner and Lenuvien always seemed interested in returning to his friends.  But there was something that held him back.  Something stayed him from raising his weapon in salute and shouting to the heavens, &quot;For the Order!&quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps, when the Mother Tunare saw Fyndolyn to have enough time to spare in his duties, that he might hold palaver with his old friend and see what types of drink the little ones serve in Rivervale, where he normally seems to frequent….  <br>

He had fallen asleep at the druid circle where he had teleported Fyndolyn earlier. He was tired after casting the spell. But, something was wrong. He felt sick, and his head spun.<br>
<br>
The druid sat up, leaning against one of the stones in the circle to prevent himself from falling over. He held his head in his hands. One of the keepers of the circle noticed he had awakened, and rushed over to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Master Thistlebane! You are awake! We had feared the worst.&quot;. Several other druids rushed over, as did two black bears and a young kodiak bear.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien looked up at the small gathering. He could hardly concentrate on any of the group as his head was spinning so.<br>
<br>
The druid managed to speak. &quot;I... I seem to be... ill. Would that you cast a cleansing spell upon me?&quot;<br>
<br>
The master keeper stepped forward and frowned. &quot;We have attempted that, Master Thistlebane. It seems whatever you suffer from is not of nature. We know not what has happened. You passed out here after transporting your friend. We cannot heal your wounds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lenuvien attempted to stand when a sharp pain shot through his abdomen. Lenuvien looked down at the now festering wound that he had healed shut after disposing of the rogue in Butcherblock. It had reopened, and was severely infected.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien looked confused. &quot;How can infection set in so quickly? I just defeated the bandit that cut me mere hours ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
The druids started at this, and looked uncomfortably around at each other... each waiting for another to speak. A young druid spoke up first.<br>
<br>
&quot;M.. Master Lenuvien... y... you have been here for a week's time. W.. we have worked to k... keep the infection from spreading. B... but wh... whatever has cut you is beyond our magics. We have s... sent word t.. to SureF.. fall, b... but have not heard back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lenuvien stared; stunned. It had seemed like only hours ago he had reached the western commonlands. His thoughts went to his friend, Fyndolyn. He could surely cleanse him of the poison that had invaded his body. But, it had been a week. Fyndolyn surely would be far away by now; fighting for Tunare's glory. Lenuvien motioned for the others to help him stand. They did so, and the druid whinced in pain.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien stood still for a moment, allowing the pain to subside. He then spoke, &quot;This wound is indeed not natural, as I had closed the wound immediately following the battle. But it is as infected as a wound not treated and dragged through the swamp. I'm not sure in my weakened state that I can, but I will attempt to cleanse the wound with a more powerful magic.&quot;<br>
<br>
The druid motioned for the young druid to hand him his spell book. The boy did as instructed. Lenuvien, still being supported by two others, flipped through the pages of the tome. He found the most powerful healing magics he knew, and began to recite the words inscribed there. A blue aura began to form around the druid, but the strain was too much for him. He began to lose consciousness as he spoke the words, and the spell was interrupted.<br>
<br>
None of the other druids at the ring were versed enough to cast the more powerful healing spells. And no word back from Surefall surely meant the messenger did not survive passage through the undead invasion of Kithicor Forest.<br>
<br>
The druids helped Lenuvien back to a sitting position leaning against one of the bears. The creatures soft fur made for atleast some comfort for the druid. Lenuvien began to drift off.<br>
<br>
The druid slipped into darkness.<br>

<br>
Shazanti released the shadows and stepped towards the smoking corpse of the dwarf. A small smile crosssed her lips as her eyes scanned the area. Finding what she sought, she bent down and retrieved the dagger. Noting traces of the hallucinogenic poison was still on the blade, she carefully wrapped it in silk before returning it to its sheath at her side.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>Now to return home, and see if this poison is all that it is claimed to be....</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Shazanti cast her spell and faded away.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>Shortly after, on Antonica...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Shazanti appeared within her chambers and set the sheathed dagger upon her stand. Reaching across the table, she picked up a darkened vial and a bell. She rang the bell and crossed the room to her seat by the fire.<br>
<br>
A knock sounds upon the door. &quot;Enter,&quot; Shazanti says. A young Teir'dal boy stands there. &quot;Mistress, I bring you refreshment to ease your return.&quot; Shazanti accepted the goblet of wine. &quot;Child, I must enter meditations. Please do see that I am undisturbed until we receive word of the druid.&quot; &quot;Yes Mistress,&quot; the boy said, as he backed out and shut the door. Shazanti drank from her goblet and set it down, focusing on the flames and clearing her mind.<br>
<br>
Some time passes, and again a knock upon the door. &quot;Aye child?&quot; The boy opens the door and bows, &quot;Aye, Mistress, the druid and the golden one have returned. This one watched as the priest did leave before the druid succumbed to the poison. He yet lies there now, thrashing in his delerium.&quot;  &quot;Keep him watched. It will take time for this drug to work.&quot; Shazanti places a talisman in his hands. &quot;Whosoever should be watching the druid must have this. I shall wish to know the MOMENT he awakens.&quot; &quot;Your will be done, Mistress,&quot; the boy said as he backed out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, Lenuvien, you shall perhaps never know why I chose you...however your indecisiveness will be your downfall. I shall enter your dreams, your thoughts, your imaginings...I shall teach you such sweet Hate with my torments. Ah yes, you shall be Mine very soon,&quot; Shazanti said as a small twisted smile played across her lips. &quot;What dreams are you dreaming now? Has the poison found its way into every inch of your being?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>At the druid ring in the Commonlands...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Lenuvien's body lies covered in sweat. The poison ate its way through his blood, his heart, his brain. The druids were frantic! If only they could cure him...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>Some days later, in Shazanti's chambers...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Shazanti stirs as a foreign thought enters her mind. &quot;Mistress! The druid wakes!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>Ah,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Shazanti thought, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>now is the time for testing.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She raised the vial to her lips and drank.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>Within the druid ring...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The druids did not know what to do. They had feared for their comrade, and done what they could while he was unconscious. Their fears had seemed to be over when he awoke...only to return to the darkness shortly thereafter. Now he lies thrashing, seeming to fight with every inch of his being some unknown demon. What could they possibly do to aid him?<br>

He could feel the pain in his stomach, and in his head. Faint sounds of tormented beings could be heard in the distance.<br>
<br>
Slowly, as the druid's eyes became acustomed to the darkness, he made out that he was on a stone floor. There were no walls or distinctive features within range of the half-elf's infravision. Nothing gave heat. Yet, the druid heard the sound of something moving from all sides. Lenuvien reached for his scimitar, but found that he was stripped of all his gear. The druid sat totally still, listening intently to the sounds of whatever was out there when a gruesome creature appeared directly infront of him. The rotted corpse's empty eyesockets seemed to direct a nonexistant gaze directly at the druid. Lenuvien jumped backwards at the sight. He attempted to pull himself back from the creature when something grabbed his arm from behind, and bit into his flesh. Lenuvien screamed out in pain. He pulled his arm from the creature, losing a large chunk of flesh in the process, only to have the one from before directly in front of him. The creature threw the druid back, and bit into his neck.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien let out a scream. The druids rushed to him, seeing he was soaked with sweat. As Lenuvien's heart slowed to it's normal beat, he sat back against the bear that was still there, obediently giving the druid what comfort it could.<br>
<br>
Lenuvien was already unconscious again.<br>
<br>
The keeper looked at Lenuvien and shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I fear our friend is in as much pain while unconscious as he is while awake. We must get help soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lenuvien found himself once again in the dark. He could hear the sound of tormented beings in the distance. He could hear something shuffling about in the dark. But, something was different. Something else... someone else was there. He could smell.... perfume. <p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.neilldg.com/Lenuvien.gif" width="378" height="83"></p>

<br>
His form lies twisted, bound in chains of shadow. Deep wounds scour his body, testament to the struggle within his mind. Shazanti moved nearer through the clinging darkness, a small smile playing about her lips. Beings of mindgrown terror flicked in and out of nothingness around her. She focused her will upon the surroundings, slowly...a dark cavernous dungeon began to form, grown from her will out of the druid's mind. The gibbering beasts that both terrified him and were created by him she slowly brought under her control.<br>
<br>
She slowly solidified before him, a dark figure cloaked in the deepest of black silks, the very image of herself that was presented within the waking worlds. She looked down upon his stricken form, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Tis his own mind, and yet he has no control!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Shazanti walked forward and slowly trailed a hand down the chains which bound Lenuvien's hands above his head. He fought to focus upon her face, so lost in this that when her trailing hand passed over his cheek he jerked back as if burned. She continued moving her hand down, cupping his chin and raising his head to look into his eyes. &quot;And so we finally meet, face to face if not in the flesh, pale one.&quot; His confusion showed in his eyes, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He knows not where he is...or that he truly lies in fever dream!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Shazanti realized. Confusion, terror and pain warred upon his face. The dark beasts of his mind had terrorized and toyed with him endlessly, so much that he was practically helpless before her. What horrors had he faced in this his dreaming?<br>
<br>
“Do I know you, Teir’dal witch?” he gasped. “Perhaps not, but you will come to know me,” Shazanti said. “Had I the strength, I would spit upon you and cleave you were you stand, dark hearted one!” She replied with a smile, “Now is that how Tunare’s own thank their savior?” Ah, the sweet confusion in his dazed eyes as with a strike of her hands she banished his shackles and caught his slumped body before it hit the floor.  <br>
