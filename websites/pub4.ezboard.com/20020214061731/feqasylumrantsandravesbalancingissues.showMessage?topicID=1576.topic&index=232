<br>
The main problem with the purely scientific or logical point of view/thought process is the fact it traps you into &quot;linear thinking&quot;.  This is a phenomena most easily observed when a purely scientific mind comes across someone or something that disagrees with the cold, hard facts of science.  This tends to send those who cannot stomach the idea of non-academic thoughts or ideas into a berserk frenzy, attacking those who disagree with him.<br>
<br>
The same holds true for those that follow the other path, blindly following their faith in the evidence of scientific fact.<br>
<br>
Compromise is all there is to get there.<br>
<br>
And as another comment...<br>
<br>
If you don't like the idea of public schools banning the teaching of evolution, don't send them there.  Public school = child abuse. <p><center>

And have also obviously never sat in a room with a Catholic, a Pentacostal, and a Unitarian/Universalist attempting to have an ecumenical conversation.<br>
<br>
Protestant Christianity, by its very nature, hinges on a *personal* relationship with God.  Each individual is responsible for developing and maintaining their own relationship, and to try to lump everyone who calls themselves Christian under one umbrella with one set of beliefs whould be like trying to say that a monkey and a kangaroo are exactly the same because they are all Mammals.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I look at these arguements with a bit of amusement because I find myself agreeing with those that I often disagree, and vice versa.  Between being fairly socially liberal, my own personal faith lies somewhere between Liberal Quaker and Unitarian/Universalism.  Politically, I have very little in common with those who claim affiliation with the Religious Right.  And certainly I don't see myself reflected in the notions of either those people in Washington that started this thread, or the ideas that have been thrown around on this thread that since I call myself Christian I a) must believe exactly like every other Christian, b) am somehow not allowed to view scientific pursuits as having validity, and c) am obligated to view everyone of another faith as wrong, and other faiths as invalid.<br>

&quot;There are as many paths to peace with God in this world as there are people. As mortals of limited lifespan with small minds, we are all limited in our ability to understand the Universe, and we must all undergo an individual journey. As a Christian, and as a human, it does not matter to me the path an individual takes to find their way to The Creator, be it through Protestantism or Buddhism or Science or Wicca or Atheism (although I'm not sure how exactly that path would work. its seems such an unlikely journey). What matters is that they undertake the journey, and continue to take one step forward at a time, no matter how small that step or how infrequent. &quot;<br>
<br>
I will close by reiterating *yet again* that neither myself or any other person of faith who has posted on this thread has said &quot;evolution is wrong and can't possibly be true.&quot;  What we have said is &quot;yes, we can all see natural selection at work, but we do happen to beleive in a divine Creator.&quot;  The intolerance I have viewed is from a group of people who seem to take pleasure in villifying people of faith. <p><center><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/bearne.jpg"><BR>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You may call yourself a Catholic, but the Church won't view you as a practicing Catholic, but as a lapsed one.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, a very quick check of Catholic doctrine would prove this wrong.  I suggest you pick up a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic church (available in most good bookstores) before you speak as if you know what you are talking about.  In fact, whether one is a &quot;practicing&quot; (ie, attending mass, receiving the sacrements) Catholic or not, there is no distinction made by the Church.  If you are baptized into the Catholic faith, at any age, then regardless of whether or not you &quot;practice&quot; the faith, you are still considered a Catholic (whether you consider yourself one or not :P)<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that many people who are no longer actively practicing Catholics still consider themselves to BE Catholics (and they are correct to do so, in the eyes of the Church) -- being Catholic, at least where I was raised, has come to have a cultural as well as religious connotation; sort of the way being Jewish, in addition to being an ethnicity and religion, also has a strong cultural connotation, with many people of Jewish ancestry who call themselves atheists/agnostics or are no longer actively practicing, still consider themselves to be Jews.<br>
<br>
I myself consider myself to be Catholic -- in a cultural sense.  I am no longer practicing, but the Church has influenced my life, my family history, and my upbringing in such a strong way that I still call myself Catholic, and rightly so, for I was baptized into the Faith, and practiced it as an adult for many years.  At this point in life, I am pretty much an agnostic, so I no longer practice.  However I can assure you that in the Church's eyes, as well as culturally, I am a Catholic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Religion intrudes on our lives everyday, in the same manner this bill proposes to intrude on the education of children in Washington.

<br>
As a political libertarian, I agree that so-called &quot;blue laws&quot; should be repealed immediately.  However, these laws are, for the most part, NOT enforced anymore, so I hardly think this constitutes an every day intrusion into our lives.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Religion says don't question anything, just believe.<br>
<br>
Religion: We know, but you can't question it, just have faith<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
While I dont deny that there are probably religions that exist that say something close to that, you can't just say that about all religions.  Sign up for RCIA classes at your local Catholic church.  They're not just for people converting, they're for anyone who wants to know more about the Catholic faith.  Drop by the rectory and talk to the priest.  Parishoners who are having difficulty understanding certain teachings, have questions about the Canon, etc, are encouraged to stop by and ask questions.   I can assure you that you can question to your heart's content.  Questioning is encouraged, as it leads to further understanding -- and while you may not agree with the answers you receive, perhaps your eyes might be opened to the broad generalizations and blatantly incorrect statements you are making.<br>
<br>
If religion as a whole was as closed to study and investigation and creativity as you want people to believe (and seem to want to believe yourself), then please explain to me the existence of great religious people who have contributed to the advance of civilization and the betterment of people everywhere in so many ways, just for example some Catholics such as St. Augustin, St. Thomas Aquinas in philosophy, Michelangelo, Tolkein, and C.S. Lewis in the arts, Lemaitre (who developed the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory) in science, Blessed Cardinal Bellarmine in political theory,  Maria Montessori in education... I could list many, many more scholars and thinkers of many religions who have studied, investigated, questioned, created... contrary to your believe that &quot;religion&quot; tells everyone to not question, not investigate, not study.<br>
<br>
I'm an agnostic right now in my life. However I am not the type of knee-jerk agnostic that you seem to be, Sijandi.  I dont think of &quot;religion&quot; as being out to get me, I dont think of all religions as evil, all religious people as sheep, and I recognize that religions and churches, like all things run by human beings, are prone to error and falsehood and corruption at times (we could compare a religious organization to say, a University Science department -- does corruption in the beaurocracy of the department invalidate the good that goes on in the classrooms and in the individual lives of the scholars?) ... and so therefore I dont have any need, as you seem to have, to paint all religious folk, and all religions, as unthinking, unquestioning, and even more amusing, all the same.  I have no need to make generalizations, I've lived as both a religious person and an areligious person, and I can say that there is as much rigidity and herd-like mentality and unquestioning following among the areligious as there is in any sector of religious life.<br>

<br>
&quot;Proof&quot; offered by Harabec. Well, I followed the links. The UARk link had one glaring fallacy. Paul was not an Apostle. Paul was a convert after Christ died. The second link led to a discourse on verifying the infallibility of the written word. <br>
<br>
Ok. Let's accept the Christian Bible is not only mostly historically correct, but absolutely correct. <br>
<br>
Christ teaches his disciples to gather together to worship. <br>
<br>
But modern &quot;Christians&quot; don't feel the need to worship with others, it interferes with their &quot;personal understanding of God&quot;. <br>
<br>
Christ teaches his disciples to partake of communion, and to do so in memory of him.<br>
<br>
Modern &quot;Christians&quot; don't feel the need to partake of communion. It's not really necessary to have that &quot;personal relationship with God&quot;. <br>
<br>
Christ teaches his disciples he is the Living Word. The Word made flesh. <br>
<br>
But the Word, the Bible, doesn't have to be accepted in toto, only what you agree with and accept. <br>
<br>
Hmmmm, I'm starting to understand now. You are what you call yourself, simply because you decide that is what you are. If you consider yourself a Christian, you are one.<br>

Okay. That makes it perfectly clear to me.<br>

Where exactly are you getting this information from?  There are many different denominations with different beliefs.  I don't know of any Christian that doesn't talk about God or Worship together.  An example of worshiping together is Church.<br>
<br>
[q] Christ teaches his disciples to partake of communion, and to do so in memory of him.<br>
<br>
Modern &quot;Christians&quot; don't feel the need to partake of communion. It's not really necessary to have that &quot;personal relationship with God&quot;. [/q]<br>
<br>
Umm, at my church we have communion regularly to symbolize the crucifixion and the only means through which we are saved.  There may be some churches that don't, but then again I don't know of all other denominations.<br>
<br>
[q] Christ teaches his disciples he is the Living Word. The Word made flesh. <br>
<br>

<br>
This may be true of some Christians, but definately not all of us.  I agree and accept everything in the Bible.  Some of the teachings are harder to understand then others and must be studied to determine the interpretation.  People can look at the same thing and interpret it a different way.<br>
<br>
BTW, Paul was considered an Apostle, I believe the Bible referred to him as such a number of times.  It takes a change in the heart to turn to believing, so nothing I say or anyone else says will change you unless there is a change inside.  /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zistin>Zistin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 5:33:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=249>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.houston.rr.com/rards/downloads/timbo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> I take it back, Sijand...you are an jerk, if only for this statement:<br>

<br>
Zistin, when you refuse to accept standard definitions for belief systems, ideologies, etc. you merely place yourself on another plane. Just because you call yourself a Christian and identify with some of the beliefs of a Christian doesn't make you a Christian.<br>
<br>
As for anyone responding to your question, Zistin, I believe it's been done several times. You just don't want to deal with that portion of the discussion. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where is the rightness, the appropriateness, of deigning to try and tear down someone else's belief system, insultingly, and then try and ingratiate your own beliefs onto them as part of that process?&quot;  (...of deigning...? you'll have to explain the use of that word in this context, doesn't make much sense to me)<br>
<br>
You profess to be Christian, and have stated you respect the beliefs of others, but say they are wrong. Your &quot;Christian&quot; belief is the only right one, it even says so in the scripture. How is this any different from someone non-religious saying the same thing? I respect your right to hold your own beliefs, but they're wrong. Someone mentioned pot and kettle. Seems just as appropriate from this end.<br>
<br>
I resort to sarcasm when there is no longer any  point in trying to hold a civil discussion. Trying to be civil while repeatedly being lumped in with flamers and foot-in-the-mouth morons doesn't set well on this end either.  <br>
<br>
So far as I'm concerned, anyone having the gall, audacity and egotism to claim they know the answers to life and existence, when they don't even know the basics of the religion they claim to be a part of, doesn't deserve civility. To me you are no different than the &quot;Moslem&quot; terrorists who attacked our country. They didn't accept all the tenets and precepts of Islam. They felt they could twist and distort the beliefs they were taught to suit their own needs. <br>
<br>
This has been the hallmark of religion since the earliest days of man. In my opinion, religion is corrupt by it's very nature. Religious people may have done many great things, but that speaks of the people, not the religion. I believe, based on all I've studied in my short lifetime, that organized religions are responsible for more human death and bloodshed than any other cause throughout history.<br>
<br>
&quot;Christians&quot; came to this country and promptly started practicing genocide against the native peoples, because they were &quot;godless savages&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Christians&quot; had no problem enslaving some people merely because of their national origin/ethnicity.<br>
Of course, man has made this a practice since the dawn of time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Christians&quot; at one point in this country's history accomplished Prohibition of Alcohol. That was a really good move, look at all the gangsters and violence that resulted. The same mindset is what got marijuana and other drugs prohibited also. This country used to be quite different than it is now in many aspects. Laws against gambling, liquor sales on Sunday, age limits for alcohol consumption...the list is very long. Then there are the laws establishing the tax exempt status of religious organizations. Simply put, the rest of the country is shouldering the burden which the churches have been exempted from, this means I pay indirectly to support those churches in this country. With all the talk of school vouchers, non-religious people will end up shouldering the burden for the education of the children of religious parents.<br>
<br>
The proposed law in Washington is just another example of religious opposition to education. Real education. Not the repetition of fairy tales passed down, regardless of how accurately the stories have been repeated. Repeating a lie accurately is still a lie.<br>
<br>
For those of you who demand validation of your beliefs, not just the right to have them, when you accept the beliefs of others as just as valid as your own you can expect acceptance. So long as you continue to deny beliefs of others, you can't expect others to accept yours. I don't expect anyone to accept my beliefs, they are between creation/existence and myself. I will continue to feel free to disregard anyone else's opinion in this matter, especially those who cannot maintain an intelligent discussion.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry there were so many flamers in this thread, a lot of good discussion ensued here. When you reach the point that discussion is pointless it's time to quit. My remarks in my last post might have been tactless, but many comments directed to me have been also so I don't feel badly about it.<br>
<br>
I stand by what I said, take it any way you want to. <br>

Well, let's call them shall we? <br>
<br>
Paul being an apostle: Rivlas is correct, most Christian denominations that I know of, anyway, do consider St. Paul to be an apostle.  His conversion came after Jesus' death, however he did join the apostles, lived with them, debated with them, worshipped with them, then began his journey abroad to spread the Word and establish Churches.<br>
<br>
Calling yourself a Christian doesn't make yourself one (if  you dont worship with others, take communion, etc, etc):  Last I checked, there were over 20,000 divisions of Protestant Christianity alone.  Then you've also got the Roman Catholic Church, the various Orthodox Churches on top of those.  Within all these divisions, you have an extremely varied interpretation of how to follow Christ, how to worship, whether or not the bible is literally correct or not, whether communion is merely symbolic or the true embodiment of Christ, whether the bible is the last word of god or whether Tradition or private revelation  are divinely given, how to interpret scripture, etc, etc.  Hell, even the apostles had debates over these things, they even debated whether one had to be circumcised or not to be considered a Christian (you might finally open the bible Sijandi, and find out the answer to that one, as its pretty clear you haven't studied scripture beyond learning the basic bible stories of the Flood, the Nativity, and the Crucifixion, and that probably when you were a kid).  The point is Christianity takes a wide variety of forms, but the basis of being able to call one's self a Christian, the common denominator, seems to be a belief that Jesus Christ is the savior, and a desire and attempt to live one's life according to his teachings.  The teachings are what are open to interpretation, some will hold them to every one of them quite literally, others will interpret them more broadly, some will apply more importance to some than others, some groups do not believe Jesus was the actual son of God but that he was still the savior, some believe in the Trinity others do not, some believe you have to attend church every week to keep the sabbath, others believe that a private worship of God and prayer will suffice, some believe in infant baptism others do not, some denominations interpret the bible quite literally and believe that the earth is 6000 or so years old, others will accept the basic premise of evolution but will see God's hand in it... Who are you to say any of these people are not Christians?  If they profess a belief in Christ and his teachings, then in my book, they are Christians, no matter what outward form their worship of Him takes so long as they are trying to follow His example.  You accuse Harabec and Zistin of being close-minded and thinking others have the wrong way, but you are far, far worse, you think you can say who is and who isnt a Christian, and what is required to be a Christian, when not only do you have a profound lack of respect for Christianity, but you show a REMARKABLE lack of understanding of any of the basics of ANY of the major Christian denominations or the bible.  You are EXACTLY what you accuse religious people of being.  You're a close minded, non-thinking elitist sheep who, armed with only a MINISCULE amount of actual facts, tosses out blatant lies, evasive half-truths, and broad generalizations to dismiss the viewpoints of millions of other people.  You sir, are a hypocrite of the worst sort, and embody everything you profess to hate about Christians.<br>

Hmm, ok what else to shoot down...<br>

Substitute &quot;political institutions&quot; for religion and I think you would be much, much closer to the truth here.<br>
<br>
Also, my citation of great Catholic minds was not done to credit the religion for their great works -- I offered their existence and their achievements to disprove what you stated earlier about religion forcing people to not question and study and investigate.  These were all religious people.. and not just in name only. Hell, Lemaitre was a *priest*, held closer to the laws and teachings of the Church than a layperson, and he developed the Big Bang theory.  Yes, these were individual achievements, not religious ones - but if the Church and religion were as you say, none of their achievements would have been possible.<br>

Christians also came to this country and lived peacefully with the Native people - ever hear of the Quakers?  They were also, along with the Catholic church, quite active in the abolition movement, and in participating in the underground railroad.  Just one example for you.  Slavery did not originate with Christianity.  The largely a-religious ancient greek and roman societies practiced slavery in a particularly harsh form.  Contrast this with the practice of slavery among very religious ancient Jews, who stood out for their compassionate practice freeing any slave that was mistreated or abused in any way.<br>
<br>
Why dont you put a *some* in front of the term Christians.  SOME Christians came here and even persecuted other Christians.  The puritans persecuted, most notably, those who were Church of England, Roman Catholics, and Quakers.  Those who were CofE mostly stayed to the more liberal climate of Boston while the puritans maintained settlements in Salem area, Plymouth area, etc.  Quakers tended to keep themselves to themselves, as the Puritans had it in for them as well.  Catholics faced persecution from both puritans and CofE, and tended to keep to themselves, many went to Rhode Island which, because of Roger Williams and others, had a more religiously liberal atmosphere, as well as further places like Maryland that were certainly more tolerant towards all.<br>
<br>
SOME people persecute others.  Its not religion that is responsible for this, its human nature.  Religion is ONE TOOL that the cruel have and can use to persecute others.  This is unfortunate, and obviously a perversion of all that is good in religion.  But it is by NO means the only tool available for the unjust to wield power over others.  As I said earlier, substitute &quot;political institutions&quot; for &quot;religion&quot; and I think your statement about religion being responsible for all sorts of ills becomes MUCH closer to truth.  There's a ton of other ways to enable persecution, religion is just ONE and it doesn't invalidate religion any more than substituting &quot;political institutions&quot; invalidates the concept of having a government to maintain order and organization in a nation.<br>

Frankly, the only people I have seen in this thread making these kinds of demands, are you, and the anti-religion bandwagoneers.  Why dont you drop the polite veneer you're trying to maintain, Sijandi, and say what you really think.  You may not type in ALL CAPS D00D and use swear words, but underneath your sneeringly polite exterior I bet you're seething with anger and disgust at the religous folk just like the other ignorant and immature flamers on your side.  Go ahead, let it all out - I bet you're just dying to start SHRIEKING AND SCREAMING AND TEARING YOUR HAIR OUT and saying OH MY GOD HOW IGNORANT AND BLIND THESE GOD DAMN CHRISTIANS ARE OMG OMG OMG!~!@$#@<br>
<br>
Because I know that's what your thinking and feeling.  What I want to know is, if religion is so silly and worthless to you, why does a civil debate on it provoke so much anger in you all? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
