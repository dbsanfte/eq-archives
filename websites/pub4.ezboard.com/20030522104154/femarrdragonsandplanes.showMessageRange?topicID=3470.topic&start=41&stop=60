<br>
The average stock portfolio is now worth 75% of what it was about 2 years ago...<br>
<br>
I dont believe that any politician democrat, republican or other would put politics ahead of his own wallet in any case.<br>
<br>
Alan Greenspan is a Republican, Clinton could have appointed a democrat to replace him but was smart enough to realize that Dr. Greenspan is the best person for the job.<br>

Instead you put it here.  You KNEW what was goign to come of it,  come on now.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for me insisting on not liking you.  To use your own stance,  nowhere did I say I do or do not like you.  In fact, I have no feelings either way really.  If I didn't like you or more so hated you, then I would do what Raed does and attack you at every opportunity.  In fact it is quite the opposite.  Some of your posts DO have some good points, thoughts, reasoning, rational. <br>
<br>
On to the heart of the matter.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to hear about your friends who are unemployed,  and that is genuine.  I myself and some friends have gone into business for ourselves after being laid off back in october and jobs in our field just not existing.<br>
<br>
So, also having quite a few friends out of work, I to would love nothing more than to lay a concrete blame, point a determined finger at a single cause for the problems.   It just can't happen though.  As much as we would like it to, it just can't.  Not this time around.<br>
<br>
A lot of the blame can be laid at the feet of investor confidence.  They have none.<br>
<br>
Now you brought up Microsoft.  Microsoft has nothing to do with this.  They are in a league of their own.  Personally, as crazy as it sounds, Ithink they are trying to do as much as possible that is "questionable" to keep the courts as busy as possible and not be able to ever truly pin them down on anything.  They however will do it to themselves, I know of 4 major companies in this area who are either investigating, or moving into the phase where they can move away from an MS based company. That is a different rant however ;)<br>
<br>
Yes, the president has effects on the economy (the president meaning the administration currently in office).   I won't say republicans over democrats or vice versa because quite honestly the whole party division thing is a waste of time and does nothing more than support lines of opposition.  I think they should do away with the whole party system all together.  They don't mean what they used to, at least not as clearly as they used to.<br>
<br>
Foreign economies also have an effect on our economy.<br>
Consumer spending.<br>
Investor Confidence.<br>
Corporate growth.<br>
War.<br>
<br>
All have effects on our economy.<br>
<br>
Foreign economies,  I dont think have a great deal at this time to do with anything.<br>
<br>
War.  Yes,  the whole afgahn thing is definatly having an effect.  Can bush (Shrub.. hehe cute),  back out now?  Until his advisors tell him too, no.  (Remember a Pres and an administration is only as good as it's advisors).  The bulk of the people still want us there.  Likewise,  everyone condemned daddy Bush, AND Clinton for getting involved in things like this and not finishing the job.  Bush started it with binnie boy,  how can he back out without it being done?  Just devils advocate there for a min.<br>
<br>
Now lets look at the last three.  Just to see what that does to us.<br>
<br>
The situation:<br>
    Corporate america has taken a major beating over the last few quarters.   9-11 has effected corporations in MANY ways, but then along comes the sudden realization that big business is not on the straight and narrow.  Yes so far only a handful have been questioned (Worldcomm, Enron, Arthur Anderson, Merck, etc etc..  yes Merck was absolved but they were added for a day or two.).  These companies are tanking, investors are gettign MAJORLY screwed.  Investor confidence is shakey.<br>
<br>
Investors are not investing like they used to.  Companies have to have income to grow.  One of these sources of income are investors. Contrary to popular belief it is a biggie too.<br>
<br>
Now,  after 9-11 unemployment took a major hit.  It would be up to the administration and corporate america to bring it back.  Administration too busy dealing with how to heal the wounds so now it is up to corporate america.  Corp america is losing backing, being forced to cut jobs.   People out of work can't spend.  Corporate america loses consumer spending,  corporate growth stalls.  We are stuck in a nasty circle.<br>
<br>
Can the administration change this?  Yes.  When? When the majority of the people stop crying for revenge and start crying for our countries growth.  Right now, (and justifiably so) they want blood.   <br>
<br>
SO what is all of this to say?  Simply that there are MANYMANY factors in an economy.  While the administration does have effects,  right now. . our current situation... there are so many negative forces on the major factors of our economy, that we are in deep @#%$ until some MAJOR changes occur.<br>
<br>
In adminstration, in business, in general.  I don't think the administration can do enough on it's own to fix this.  Some blame, and some responsibility has to be laid on the corporations as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
I could just as easily post a list such as this:<br>
<br>
The Right: Violates civil liberties<br>
The Left: Preserves civil liberties<br>
<br>
The Right: Violates seperation of church and state<br>
The Left: Upholds the framers' intent.<br>
<br>
The Right: Supports racial disparity and discrimination<br>
The Left: Supports racial equality<br>
<br>
The Right: Supports profits at the expense of workers wages<br>
The Left: Supports decent worker compensation<br>
<br>
...I could go on.  However, this list would be totally bunk.  Just like, in fact, the piece of crap you just tossed up.  I know conservatives who are vile, contemptable individuals, and I know those who are genuinely appalled at some really stupid things the liberal movement has done.  I also know liberals who are vile, contemptable individuals, as well as those who are really interested in social justice in a way your average Ditto-head cannot understand or empathize with.<br>
<br>
The biggest mistake people make is trying to group folks into either category, and then having a field day with the stereotypes and charicitures.  Finding someone who in personal life emulates your notions of the stereotypical liberal or conservative is nigh on impossible, it is very hard to find someone who totally swallows whatever the ideological party line is they are most associated with.<br>
<br>
For instance, your post sure as heck does not make me think less of the right, but it goes a long way towards pointing out some well-entrenched brainwashing in whatever is passing for your psyche.  Grow up, look at the facts, and try and think a little bit more independently than what ideologue_01 told you on the radio.  That list was a freaking joke, just like the one above. <p><center><IMG SRC=" http://www.unicorntrad.org/mal_sig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udawnen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dawnen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/17/02 12:39:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair enough</span><hr size=1> Ghie - I started getting scared around Nov '99.  It is true I could have waited a bit longer to pull out and made a bit more money, but now my decision to bail when I did looks pretty good.  If I could figure it out I'm sure these big wigs did too.  You don't see billionaires on the news complaining about how much money they lost.  The ones that got hurt were the average uneducated mutual fund holder crying about how they thought the ride was going to last forever.  <br>
<br>
The ones urging for interest rate hikes were well aware of what was going to happen and I'm sure they moved a large percentage of their wealth into bonds/real estate and other such investments to weather out the storm.<br>
<br>
Malevant -  I have looked at the facts and I stand by my assessments.   Granted, when I was young and idealistic I used to believe the lies and fear tactics used by the Democrats.  I used to believe in Santa Claus back then also.<br>
<br>
But then I grew up and started trying to find out the truth for myself.  It wasn't easy to find the truth.  Most americans don't read any further than the headlines of the liberal controlled media.  But some of us are willing to put forth the time and effort to dig a little deeper.  <br>
<br>
That is what I suggest to all americans do before they vote.  Do the research.  Put forth the effort.  Don't take anything at face value. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaelie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caelie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/17/02 1:06:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair enough</span><hr size=1> Malevant, that could go on forever. Bottom line is what a person is looking for from their government or how they interpret the Constitution.<br>
<br>
Just because I'm a right winger doesn't mean I'm against racial equality. Difference is, I don't think its the Governments place to step in and tell employers who they have to hire.<br>
<br>
 Its not the governments place to support people forever with Welfare. Do I feel pity for the less fortunate? Of course I do, but thats where friends and family should come in and help care for them. Most Republicans feel that as long as the Government is taking care of people, why would the have any incentive to do better? When do people stand up and try to do better? I know if I was cold and hungry and not getting help from the government, I would definately try to better myself. I don't think anybody is saying that Democrats or Republicans are any better or any worse than the other. The whole argument is about each individuals opinion on how things should be run.<br>
<br>
Real Life government should be like the game EQ. What does the government do in EQ? Provides a military. Did EQ just give us stuff or did we have to earn it? Do they force the good and the evil characters or the black and white characters to play together. No, we do that on our own. <br>
90% of the players out there are genuinally good people and I'm sure we're not all of the same party. Yeah, EQ has its share of terriorists (KS'rs; Intentional Trainers; but they're delt with in time. I buff newbies in Misty Thicket, but not because the EQ government tells me I have to. I do it because I want to.<br>
<br>
I'm not a Right winger thats way out there. I even support seat belt laws, helmet laws, car seat laws etc. but I don't believe in hand-outs and thats what seperates me from the Left wingers that are way out there.<br>
<br>
My whole point is that this guy can't go pointing fingers at Bush no more than we can go pointing fingers at the Clinton administration just because they're not the party of his choice. As one guy posted, several factors have caused the decline in the economy. As far as Democraps, I was refering to Clinton specifically and those that condone his behavior. Theres a democrat in Georgia that I would vote for in a heartbeat if he was to run for President and thats Zell Miller. <p>Caelie<BR>

  <br>
1. First of all to blame either party for this just shows your inability to understand the principles behind MacroEconomics or Finance<br>
    A.  Neither party could be held responsible for the corporate accounting scandals..Ex: Enron, World Com, thanks Aurthur Anderson(A home town corporation...I live a block from thier headquarters in Chicago)...how can u blame a political party for people that lie and cheat and an accounting firm that takes bribes to okay it and then tries to shred the evidence?<br>
    B. Where the Blame lies: It falls squarely on the back of the terrorists from Sept 11 and the accounting scandals rocking corporate America...if ya guys argue that ill post all the major indicies for equities prior to the Incident and show you how the economy was poised to recover as retail sales were growing at that point..and I dont mean Kmart,Walwart sales...I mean high end places Ex: Designers..Kenneth Cole,DKNY, Ralph Lauren, GM, Ford, Sony,IBM, Microsoft...etc ya get my point to further prove this New home sales were again on the rise with the lowered interest rates..in our economy we need to spend ..not save that's the way we base our economy....investing in equities(Stocks) while to you may be saving(or lately losing) in reality is spending...this feeds corporate America with an infusion of capital for them to spend on new inovations, R&amp;D, software ..whatever they want really<br>
    C.  Now all in part B held true until Enron scandal rocked the accounting world...and I dont mean a lil bit i mean it brought the damn accounting world to its knees crying...this is wear consumer confidence comes in...<br>
    D. How consumer confidence effects the stock market:<br>
1. If people have no confidence in the quarterly reports and earnings statements that come out then they withdraw thier money from thier Stock portfolios and place it somewhere safer..EX:Bonds, Cd's Moneymarket, mutualfunds(as they can't hold more than 5% of one stock, this offers a safety net for people who want stocks but not all the risk) there are several others but I dont want to go to far over peoples heads....Now as people pull thier cash from these corporations thier stock prices plumit leaving them with out the capital to R&amp;D(research and developement), they will have production overstock..aka excess inventory..as people watch thier 401k's shrink and dont spend...Until people have faith again in Corporate America this will be the case..all you will hear about is consumer confidence as it is the single most important factor at this time<br>
    No matter what president is in the White House..it doesnt really matter they are all full of sh*t...they are all bought and paid for by companies...thank you soft money in campaign contributions, Grr i fooked up going for an MBA in Buisness from Depaul University...I should have been in politcal science it pays(bribes legally..sigh thats what happens when ya let the people writing the laws take any money..they make bribes for them legal) much better to be a public official..not to mention Clinton's lil want to pay for my Lawyers..3$ to help me out on ya 1040's from his era...maybe if you werent comiting purgery(and getting away with it..props to slick willy on that), sticking cigars in ugly interns unmentionables, and banging old emploies from Arkansas he wouldn't have needed a defense fund...well this post is long gonna end it here..This has beena Blaiyne Brokenwolff lesson in how the economy is effected...(a 101 version)<br>

With this statment you act just like the liberal media. You point out that the economic down turn happens while the Republicans are in control of the White House. What you have failed to mention was that the economic down turn actually began as a Democrat was there. This does give off the impression that it is the Repulican's fault.<br>
<br>
There are two excellant books out there. One, BIAS, and the other, SLANDER, that when read really show how using a key phrase here and there can alter people's perception.<br>
<br>
Whether you meant to do that or not, just remember not telling both sides of a story is akin to either lying or covering up. <p>Flubbin<br>

Liberal Media... nice.  The problem with that assessment is the fact that the traditional arch-conservative of Liberal Media is any media that is not solely the purvue of conservative thought.  Vehement liberals can be just as bad about trying to stifle discussion, but at least they do not resort to the idiocy of crying about how vile and liberal the media is.  I have news for you that shouldn't really be news at all.  Media parots what gets it ratings.  You want to see a joke? Turn on Fox News.  You want to see another joke? Turn on MSNBC or CNN, although at least they are a bit better about not being blatantly ideological.<br>
<br>
You are not going to find a news channel that does not reflect what it percieves to be the views of its customers.  Liberal Media is about as valid as the Right's argument that &quot;PC&quot; is a Liberal phenomenon.<br>
<br>
You get right down to it, both sides are dominated by the extremes.  If you choose to subscribe to the propaganda that either side puts out, that is of course your own call, but I will be damned if I call you a free thinker because of it.  You want a &quot;true&quot; liberal or conservative viewpoint? Don't go to the media for it, go to any of your neighbors or friends who hold any sort of political view... and look at it in aggregate.  I am sick to death of hearing arch-conservatives bleat about the liberal domination of our media.<br>
<br>
Would a liberal media ignore the civil rights implications of the John Walker Lindh case? Regardless of how you feel about him, he is an American citizen denied access to a lawyer and other rights guarantied to all American citizens.  Is it a clear cut case of civil liberties violations? Not really, in my opinion, but try to find ANY debate about it on your &quot;Liberal Media.&quot;  Find any? Nope? Don't you think that a &quot;Liberal Media&quot; would be crying havoc and releasing the dogs of war on a story like that that they could unleash upon the Demon Bush?<br>
<br>
How about the by and large lack of comment on Bush's foreign policy in most common news sources? Kyoto Accords, World Court, ABM... All stuff he has backed out of.  He has done more to foster an image, rightly or wrongly, of America as an arrogant superpower than any single administration before him.  Are there valid reasons to have problems with any of the above or other numerous treaties and agreements he has backed us out of? There sure are, but you won't see any discussion of it on your &quot;Liberal Media&quot; unless you go to the fringe.<br>
<br>
Or lets look at the coverage of the Pledge of Allegiance thing.  Liberal Media sure got you conservatives there didn't it? Oh wait, nope!  Liberal Media must have missed THAT story too!  For a group of domineering and excessively PC brainwashers, they sure are asleep at the switch.<br>
<br>
Rush Limbaugh and his ilk are just as big of idiots in my book as folks like Geraldo or Donahue, or whomever the left has taken up as their poster child O'Reilly Wannabe this week.  But the fact is, just because that you see liberal views expressed in a free country on a free media does not *gasp!* mean that it is dominated by a Liberal Media Conspiracy.  Media follows the cash.  Otherwise, the stations and networks we have today would have been replaced by those who DID follow the cash.  They don't give a flying fvck about liberal or conservative, they are after profits and demographics.  But feel free to get upset when you see ANY non-conservative commentary on the news, it just affirms your own hypocrisy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uflubman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FlubMan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/18/02 8:07:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3470.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Liberal Media</span><hr size=1> Oh no the news media isn't liberal at all.

The right party of course! that is right as in correct<br>

&lt;&lt;I LOVE it when this stuff happens. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
what stuff?  WTF are you talking about?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Every speech the Prez makes from now to election will mention the 'war' whatever<br>
that means at the time. Its the only issue he gains support on.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
well you are already wrong on this one, and his job approval rating is still high. He hasnt mentioned war in his economic speches. nice try, thanks for playing<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The Prez will order an invasion of something somewhere before the election,<br>
most likely Iraq in October. We will NEVER stop hearing about it. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You mean like Clinton who invaded Bosnia to take the heat off his own probs at home? Who sent troops off on more wild goose chases than any other president? More engagements than any other president?  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;It wont make a damn bit of difference to the unemployed.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
uhmmm ok   I am sure they are all glad to know that you are speaking for them. FWIW, unemployment is at historically normal levels. It is not unusually high.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;This Prez is in serious trouble and I laugh at his party.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I repeat. look at his job approval ratings. <br>
<br>
You are a joke. Clinton took credit for the work of two republicans. He was an accident of poor timing. Reagan is 90% responsible for our positive economic environment in the 90s. Greenspan is responsible for the other 10%. Both are Republicans, tho Reagan is hardly an ideological Repub. Without Reagan's tax simplification act of 1986, we never would have had the environment of the 90s that forced American companies to become competitive with the rest of the world. We never would have had the capital structure that fueled the tech boom. Reagan and Bush Sr. take the blame from short sighted fools like you for the 2 1/2 years of unemployment and poor times but none of the credit for the results of his work. Idiots like you think that Clinton was elected and waved a magic wand and birds were chirping and times were good. You conveniently forget that his first acts were to try to let his wife socialize medicine and his Veep force thru the BTU tax which would have crushed the economy. You totally ignore the fact that while Clinton was president, bin Laden declared war on us and bombed our embassies, warships and the WTC on our own soil and NOTHING was done about it. One cruise missile attack on a camp and one innocent pharmaceutical plant blown up. He left that mess for Bush to address. You also forget that all of this corporate corruption is Clinton's mess. No one wants to remember Cendant, the first Tyco case or the Waste Management/Anderson Consulting (yes the very same Anderson Consulting of Enron fame). Bush is left to clean up the mess of his predecessor and has to take the blame for it too? Pretty disingenuous. While Clinton went around &quot;feeling&quot; everyone's pain, he did nothing about it. Typical Dem. He was just as deep in bed with corporate America as any Republican. Just last week his damn wife accepted a ride on a corporate jet with Tom Daschle instead of turning that down in the face of the recent corporate scandals like all the other members of congress did. Chutzpah, hubris, call it what you will.<br>
Then you bring up Social Security. LOL   you all fall into the same damn patterns. Go ahead. Say it, ya know ya want to . . . lockbox  lol. Social Security is a cancer. It was a political tool of FDR and every Dem Pol since. He pushed it through COngress by talking about saving indigent elderly. He never admitted in his fireside chats that the Republicans agreed to the parts that affected poor elderly. He just lied to the people saying Republicans wanted to hurt old people while he refused t osign that portion of the bill without getting everything he wanted. Social Security is not a contract between govt and the people. It is a boon doggle. A political football. The Dems know it is in their best interest to keep the poor poor so they will keep voting Dem. Welfare?  LOL  call it what it is. a modern version of the Roman Circus. A way to curry votes. A way to perpetuate the class warfare that is the Democrat stock in trade. Bush is not a genius. Carter was. Carter may have been the worst president in our history, despite his IQ. Bush, like Reagan has the advantage of knowing when something does or doesnt pass the smell test. Bush tries to make a speech saying the right things. To make people feel better about the market. Like Reagan he is not a micromanager like Gore. He feels no need to put his fingerprints on everything immediately. Unlike Clinton and Gore, he is human enough to feel shame. Clinton let his whole cabinet go on TV saying he was innocent when he knew they were basing it on his lies to them. I will never forget Donna Shalala saying he was innocent because he told her so and she believed him. Gore recently came out and not only blamed the current mess on a guy who wasnt voted in til months after the mess started, but then blamed everyone except himself in his last campaign for his losing! Congress jumps to a knee jerk reaction to pass laws. It is just like campaign finance. Enforce the damn laws already on the books before you pass new ones.  Fraud is already illegal. If Clinton had actually prosecuted people under the existing laws, we might not be seeing the kneejerk, media driven need for passing NEW laws. Both sides are too busy posing to do what is right. While that is nothing new, it is a large part of Clinton's legacy, striving to win instead of to do what is right. Where does Lieberman get the balls to criticize Bush when he voted for the passage of the bill to make it harder for stockholders to sue execs? What a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
Bush follows a long line of Republicans who were simple men with a moral compass . . . Reagan, Lincoln, Ike<br>

numbers they have and ignore the rest. The statistic show a movement of hispanic<br>
workers back to Mexico at the moment. I wonder what that means?<br>
<br>
Bush went into Somalia, not Clinton. Clinton tried VERY hard to bury the Bosnia<br>
issue and simply ignore it. Pictures of dead people and lots of shall we say<br>
active journalism forced him to react. At least he didnt bomb the Canadians.<br>
<br>
So where else do you think Clinton commited troops during his admin? I am mildly<br>
curious.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the confusion is the word 'tanked', a drop of 7% in one day is 'tanking'<br>
in my book. However it rallied. This time.<br>
<br>
Merentha Social Security exists. The party that tries to lean on it will lose every election they have. It doesnt matter if you like it or not. It doesnt matter how you think it was created. It is there. DEAL WITH IT. Shrub is in office. His ball.<br>
<br>
But Flubman, unlike the tripe you just posted actually made some valid points.<br>
Dont try and tell me that the Democrats are outdoing Rebublicans at the ONE feature that is a hallmark of the Republicans since the party was invented,<br>
being in bed with Big business. I dont know how to lable your assertion,<br>
words are too weak.<br>
<br>
If you think that the United States is now competative in the world, Take a look at the price of steel. Its cheaper at the moment to buy steel from Japan and ship it<br>
to Detroit, than it is to rail it there from the east coast. Why is that?<br>
Could it be that the Steel industry still refuses to convert to more efficient<br>
converters? Could it be the railroads like to price gouge? Beats me, Im a computer tech, not an economist. But I can tell you all the chips I see are made somewhere<br>
other than the USA. Yeah we are real competative, and all thanx to Reagan.<br>
