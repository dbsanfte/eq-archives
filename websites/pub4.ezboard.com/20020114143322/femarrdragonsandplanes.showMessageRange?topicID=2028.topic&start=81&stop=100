<br>
  There's a couple of problems with that theory.<br>
<br>
(1)  We -KNOW- Magister is VS capable.  There is absolutely no doubt in our minds of this fact.<br>
<br>
(2)  The rotation only works because it's fair, and everyone has a chance to join it.  As soon as we exclude a guild, be it Magister or the Flaming Butt Weasels of Doom ,who is capable of taking down VS, then the whole stack of cards comes tumbling down.<br>
<br>
Just like it has now.<br>
<br>
(3)  Most of us know and like people in Magister.  Hell, I'm on good terms with Koryo : ).  If any of you had sent me a tell about it I would have said &quot;Sure, you need to talk to Yenom to arrange it, I'll make sure he knows you're looking for it&quot;.  And I would have done just that. <br>
<br>
(4)  There are public forums to bring this matter up before it gets to the &quot;Ignore common sense and courtesy and pull VS through people buffing to take him&quot; stage.  Others have asked on the public Storm's Fury boards and received an answer in a timely fashion... ironically the whole suituation was clarified there about a day or so before this errupted.  And hell... even a quick flame about how unreasonable the people in the rotation were being would have likely had the same result because if you WERE being kept out of the rotation it does not take a genius to see this suituation happening from about 2 months back.<br>
<br>
  No one has explained to me yet just why the guilds in the rotation would keep Magister out of the rotation.  Sure, it adds another guild in.  But if we DON'T add them in, the whole system is flawed.  And then we get suituations like this, which help no one.  And to be brutally honest, what does 1 more guild matter when there are about 10 or so already in.<br>
<br>
  &lt;shrug&gt;  You could argue that Magister needed to prove themselves by beating a rostered guild to VS.  However, considering that there is no doubt at all that Magister is VS capable, I see no reason why that couldn't have been waived in this case.<br>
<br>
  In short, put away the Black Helicopters guys.  There was no conspiracy, it was a simple breakdown of communication.  Lets try to make sure it doesn't happen again. <br>

That is why I only addressed myself to that part of your post. I made no reference to what Arn was like in RL. I made no reference to his approach to life off this game. I referred to his self stated approach to the game. I made lots of qualifying statements trying to leave no doubt that I was NOT flaming him or the guild. The point of my post was to state that such gameplay would inevitably lead to conflict with others who play differently. I made no qualitative judgements about any style of game play other than those which violate Verant rules. I did not say his idea of fun was to deprive others of their fun. I WOULD make a value judgement about that. Some people like to pay to port around the world, others like to ride the boat for free. Some people like to solo and some like to group. Some like to guild up and others prefer to be independent. Some like to be social and stay in busy, chatty zones and others like to stay &quot;far from the maddening crowd&quot;. I made no value judgement. What I was saying is that if Magister is used to being all alone and not having to deal with company, there will inevitably be times when the presence of company leads to conflict.  Apparently such a case happened recently. Magister stepped on toes because they are not used to waiting on lists for their turn.  How you turned that into a slam on Arn's approach to real life is beyond me but THAT is what I took exception to; having you put words in my mouth. <p>Merentha,

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Arn says Magister tries to operate in areas where they wont run into other guilds/groups. He says he doesnt care to please anyone but himself. I think we can assume that his game play can be classified as anti social by these examples.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think you missed the true intent of what I was saying...I'll quote myself, then explain further.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ...by coincidence of where we usually hunt, we almost never see other players or guilds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It is not a goal of myself or my guild to obtain the approval of other people on this server.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We, as in Magister, do NOT choose our hunting grounds based upon their isolated locations. The nature of the game that we play, the &quot;EQ High End Game&quot;, dictates that few people will be in the same location as us, usually. On rare occasions another guild or groups will share a zone with us. But normally we are alone. <br>
<br>
That has NOTHING to do with a desire by us to avoid other players. Rather it is a coincidence of the fact that most players on this server could not survive to make it to where we hunt. Quite a few can, but most can't. <br>
<br>
As for who I/we try to please in game and in life. In my opinion, 90% of the people in this world just try to please to themselves. To some of them, that means helping other people...feeding and clothing the needy, healing the sick, protecting the weak, caring for loved ones, being a good friend, good lover, and/or a good person. I don't think people do those things because &quot;it's the right thing to do&quot;, I believe that they mostly do those things because it makes them feel good about themselves. <br>
<br>
Some people would not admit to that, but I would. I think most of the people that would not admit to that, at least to a certain extent, are not being honest in their introspective seekings. <br>
<br>
Perhaps I am too philosophical &lt;shrugs&gt; that's the way I am. But if you really want Philsophy...I'll leave you with this. <br>

I'm sure your statement is true to some degree, but thats not the only reason to try to treat others fairly. Personally, I've always been a competitor.  I've played football, basketball, baseball and all sorts of games since I was 5.  Over the course of that time, I've been cheated a few times(ever lost to a team in baseball with a pair of 15 year old twins who are passed off as 12 year olds in your 11-12 year old league?), and I think thats why I have such a devout sense of fair play and, by extension, right and wrong.  I will not go out of my way neccessarily to avoid slighting someone if they're asking for it, but if its easily avoidable, I won't do it.  Simply put, if I don't think its fair to the other person, I try to think of a different course of action.  <br>
<br>
Oggy: I wasn't praising Da`kor, I was stating a fact. As far as accomplishments go, Da`kor was among the best guilds in the game for their time. Magister is not at that level.  The brazen arrogance that some of the new Magister members have gotten because they happen to be in a guild with people who know what they're doing pisses me off, fo sho. These people didn't build the guild, are not especially good at their class, and are not deserving of the respect they think is owed to them. This obviously doesn't apply to all your new members(you have some very good players applying), but I think it does apply to some.  Thats all I was saying.  <br>
<br>
Elwyn: Sorry if my information on the removal of the Da`kor guildname is incorrect, that was the info I had from the best source I could find, a member directly prior to the disbanding. He told me not to bring his name up so I won't, but you probably won't have a hard time figuring out who it was.  I won't mention it again. <br>

<br>
Da`kor: always among the first to smash something.  Usually with lower numbers than the other guys.  You see the Da`kor guildtag, you know the person is pretty damn good at playing their class. At their peak Da`kor was a pretty close knit group of people who had been together for the most part for a good while. A lot of the people in Magister, I've never heard of(not that thats a deciding factor, but hell, I know or at least have heard of damn near everybody on the server in the 57+ crowd).<br>
<br>
Magister: You have the wealth of experience your older members bring with them. You are not, however, in the top two or three guilds in the game any longer.  You can make a compelling case that your aren't even the best guild on the server, but thats not the point I'm trying to make.  When you kill Yelinak, and Tormax, and clear North Wing of ToV, you're getting close. But you still won't be back at Da`kor levels, because thats all already been done, and with some regularity.  When I see someone with the Magister guildtag, if I recognize the name, I can be assured they probably are pretty capable. However, if I don't recognize the name, I wouldn't place them very far above any random person I meet in the game, because quite honestly, some of your new aquisitions used to be.... lets call them sub-par abilitywise(nothing wrong with that, if they've learned thats great, its just not up to the level Da`kor was at, which is what you asked).  <br>
<br>
If all of Da`kor's members had hung around, would they still be near the top? Yes, I don't think anyone doubts that. Would a large portion of the new members of Magister be in Da`kor? I'll let you answer that yourself.......... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usuicidalslayne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Suicidal Slayne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/17/01 11:41:17 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/glewisjr1/kenshin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Magister, </span><hr size=1> I thought Oggie's pic was from Shawshank redemption.

<br>
As for Magister, I don't have much bad to say about the people I know in that guild.  Mukas is still a phat bastage, Vextrum is still the quietest pimp in EQ, Chuk is still a Roy Orbison wanna be, and Tyras still has the tightest mangina in EQ.  What more could you want in a guild. <br>

On a side note, Aamrie is a rather pretty name.  If I had to name a blow up love doll, that would definitely be one of my top choices.<br>

Shardmoon and others, <br>
Aamrie's RL boyfriend happens to be in Magister, you need to get your facts straight before you throw accusations around. I definately don't agree with what she is saying, but I respect the fact that she's &quot;standing by her man&quot; as it were.<br>
