The thing is, if he had the balls to say screw you people, this is my way and here are the reasons and they were actually good reasons, people wouldn't think he's the turd (had to borrow Sage's word for the day .. it fit so nicely) that he is.

I'm in a very capable guild that can do large things without outside help.  I'm also spoiled and the thought of pickup raids make me cringe when you have people like Valric at the helm of the raid.<br>
<br>
Many people are not so fortunate as I am.  These people must rely on pickup raids to do the Planes and larger things in this game.  Many people will jump at any chance to do these things once and Valric is giving them an opportunity.  The problem is that Valric is screwed up in the head.  He's shown that he's an ass and that's he's extremely greedy.  Once people start seeing this, he'll have no support for his raids.  One Epic equipped level 50something Rogue does not a raid make.<br>
<br>
Personally I'm somewhat suprised to see the number of pickup raids increase.  It looks like there are a lot of solid people out there doing these.  That isn't a bad thing at all as it allows everyone the chance to see the bigger parts of the game.<br>

<br>
Actually, I'm not surprised in the slightest.  Level 60 being the highest you can currently go, there are players gaining their post 50 levels all the time.  It's becoming a bottleneck and lets face it, the large guilds just aren't recruiting every class.  So, they get to be in the smaller guilds that can't take on a plane by themselves.  It's because of this bottle neck that I think you're seeing more pick up raids .. the people in the smaller guilds need something to do and want to play in the high level game.  There will be people coming out of the woodwork who think they can lead raids, but it's not easy and it takes a certain type of person to do it.  While intentions might be good, they can't always do it and there's nothing wrong with that.<br>
<br>
That's one of the reasons I started leading pick up raids with Sagemon, because I am in a rather small guild with some members in their 50's, but nothing to boast about.  However, if I can get a group of people together on a regular basis, then we have a shot at doing something we couldn't do alone.  Hence, the reasoning behind more pick up raids happening.<br>

<br>
I've been on a number of raids with Sagemon and Tormentcia.  I have won a roll ONE time... for the Vermiculated Tunic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   .  Yes, it's hard to watch someone win drop after drop (maybe they're the only Pally there...) AND win a BD.  Sometimes  I think, &quot;This isn't fair... I've been here as long as he/she has, and I've got NOTHING to show for it&quot;.  But hey... I agreed to the terms and joined the raid.  I'm certainly not going to whine about it after the fact.<br>
<br>
And this is for EVERY plane... not just PoG.  The rules are the rules.  You don't like Sagemon's and Tormentcia's, then don't join their raids.  Make your own rules, and raid with the few people you can convince to join you.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
And Valric, I've met you ONE time.  I picked you up in Butcher and TP'd you to WC.  You joined a Kith raid I was involved in.  You showed you're an ass there, and now you're just reinforcing it here.  I hate the fact that I even have to say that.  <br>
<br>
Point is, I've seen you rant and flame and jump up and down screaming like a little girl, too often.  I'm just wondering what you get out of that.<br>

You talking about the multi general raid for Kaluminatie, MS, someone else and your friends? If I remember it correctly it was the guild either you where in, or came with that was bitching and whining because MS was there to helping us and killing the general for their rogue. <br>
<br>
Only that guild you where with was quite upset and have several members in shout and ooc yelling about them being there and to get the hell out and leave them alone, them being greedy loot whores and that the spawns in the cabin where for your guild and you all wanted them as you where in kith first. <br>
<br>
Well sadly, I did not join your raid. I helped Kaluminatie, helped set up his general raid, and we got people from MS who where killing Renux at the time and didn't mind having the added security. So we grouped, that makes two. We did not need you nor really care if you came, but why turn you away when all you needed was to kill the general. So you all agreed, not my fault. If you didn't like MS being there you should have just stfu  and walked away.<br>
<br>
Not had that arguement between them then left after 30 minutes of bickering between the guild you where with AND ms.

Valric, don't forget the part you conveniently left (and edited) out after you got nailed to the wall on it.  Your main thing was that the raid leader (aka you), the main assist and the puller should get a blue diamond .. and everyone simply reminded you of your loot whore reputation.  Lets try not to be innocent here son .. you're far from it and the more you try to deny it, the more you are confirming everything that is written about you.  Then again, many people have dealt with you so not much confirmation is needed .. I have yet to see one person come to your defense and say any of this is untrue.

The most frightening thing about all of this is that Valric may actually believe that he didn't do the things that have been described in this thread and others.  He really could be that delusional.  Let's hope he doesn't work for the Post Office. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uyanedanielle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yanedanielle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/11/01 6:47:47 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.sons-of-tao.50megs.com/pictures/yanedanielleface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The fairest way in PoG?</span><hr size=1> /sigh<br>

To clarify, Valric, because you are obviously completely and totally clueless, it was BEFORE MS even showed up in the zone that you were acting like an ass.  And you really need to get your facts straight before starting to flame me.  Anyone who knows me, knows the facts... bottom line.  I'm not going to even touch on the MS issue.  I have a very good friend or two in that guild, and what's done is done.  Your recollection of events amazes me.  But that isn't even what I was referring to.  So... STFU.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>
