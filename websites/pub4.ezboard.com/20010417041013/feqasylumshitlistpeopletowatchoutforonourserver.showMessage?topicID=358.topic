I'm sure the last thing anyone wants to read about is another Kill Stealer however I feel everyone has a right to know who these people are so please read this. <br>
<br>
Last night I logged on for a little bit as I've been camping the Werewolf in West Karana trying to get his rare Wolfskin and / or his even rarer Wolf paw. I logged on at 9am EQ time and waited around until some time that EQ night. (WW only spawns once every EQ night.) <br>
<br>
Once he spawned, I pulled him out of the passage leading to Qeynos Hills (Where he pops.) and over to an open area off to the side of the passage where West Karana opens up. Everything was going well. I, being a bard, was kiting and bellowing on him. At one point while kiting in this area, I notice the text &quot;A Werewolf is engulfed in a swarm.&quot; <br>
<br>
I then notice a female elf sitting on a nearby hill facing me and the Werewolf. Obviously a druid using the Creeping Crud DOT spell. But why? I thought she was trying to help me even though I didn't need it. <br>
<br>
Another minute or so goes by and I see the message &quot;Mirie casts a spell&quot; as she blasts him. Suddenly the Werewolf is near death. I turn and see the werewolf on her. She casts on him once more and it started running from her. At this point I run up to Mirie and say &quot;He's mine.&quot; <br>
<br>
She didn't even acknowledge me, just stood there a second then casts again and kills the Werewolf. Leaving me with no XP and my jaw on the floor. <br>
<br>
I asked &quot;Why did you kill him? I was Kiting him.&quot; <br>
<br>
She then sighed at me, &quot;Clearly disappointed.&quot; WTF?! <br>
<br>
She said &quot;It attacked me. I don't know why it attacked me but I've got to look out for ME.&quot; <br>
<br>
Gee I don't know but maybe he didn't like that DOT she cast on it.... Did I mention that the Werewolf is level 25. Mirie is level a 45 Druid....  <br>
<br>
I then asked &quot;Can I at least loot him to see if he has what I've been looking for?&quot; She then runs over and loots it herself..... She stays bent over the mob for a few seconds then stands up, the Werewolf disappears and Mirie says &quot;Nothing. 13cp.&quot; <br>
<br>
I sat down and she left. I sent her a tell saying &quot;Please do not do that again. I'd been waiting an EQ day for him to spawn.&quot; I sent another tell saying &quot;Did you get that last tell? I hate to sound rude but I feel like I just got KS'ed.&quot; <br>
<br>
She Responded with &quot;Ignore.&quot; <br>
<br>
I did a /who all die and got a list of a few of her guildmates. I asked one of these &quot;Who is you guild leader.&quot; <br>
<br>
His response was &quot;Do I know you?&quot; then &quot;Why do you want to know who my guild leader is?&quot; When I stated that Mirie just KS'ed me, he said. &quot;She is our Guild Mistress.&quot; <br>
<br>
I then asked another of Miries guildmates &quot;Who is your Guild Leader?&quot; He replied &quot;You have a problem with Mirie?&quot; I said &quot;Afraid so. Is she the guild leader.&quot; He agreed that she was and wanted to know what happened so I told him. <br>
<br>
I would be willing to take this to their web site if they have one. Since I couldn't find one and since Mirie IS the guild leader I felt it should be posted here. <br>
<br>
I believe this to be a new KS'ing method. To DOT the mob. Your average player may not even notice it. (Especially if they're kiting.) By DOTing the mob I believe she agroed it on her without all the flashy fireworks.... <br>
<br>
I am not judging this guild but think that they and everyone else should know what their Guild Leader did. This is no way for a leader to act in my opinion. I'm anxious to hear if anyone else has had similar problems with this..... ummmm person..... <br>
<br>
       Happy Hunting..... Hopefully. <br>

Unfortunately one of my guildmates did indeed have a problem with this person. As he was asking others opinion in guild I offered to assist him in his trouble.<br>
<br>
Brief readers digest...My guildmate entered a group in the newlands at an orc camp. Apparently Mirie had been there a majority of the day. The chief spawned and was pulled and killed by the group. It was called that the group would do a random roll for the item that dropped. My guildmate rolled the highest and therefore won the item...however Mirie looted such item. My guildmate then asked Mirie if she was holding the item for him...she stated yes, (him being a monk this is not uncommon). However he did become nervous because he had not asked her to hold it for him. He then went LD..upon his return a few moment later he found her to have left the group and logged. He asked had she turned the item over to any of the other members and found that not only had she not...they were shocked by the news that she had not given him the item. My guildmate then had to wait a few days until they were online at the same time and gave her a tell. She simply stated that she deserved the item because she had rolled the second highest and had been there longer and had taken more risk than him. To put it simply she refused to give him his item. Please note that this conversation was logged and forwarded to me. <br>
<br>
So I contact Mirie and explain to her that the incident and conversation had been recorded and that my guildmate had won the item fairly. That the theft of an item could be a bannable offence and that the group agreed that all would roll on the item. She invited me to petition with the statement &quot; If they don't want my $10.00 a month..what do I care&quot;. I thanked her for her time on the matter and contacted my guildmate with the information for him to decide what to do from that point.<br>
<br>
I agree that there are those that need to be warned to players such as this. As well, I hope that her own guildmates take notice that this is NOT acceptable behavior to the rest of the players. I do know I would not want to be a follower of someone who acts in this manner. Such as all guilds...your individual actions reflect not only yourself but your guild and your guilds actions not only reflect on it but on its individuals.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the length of this post and sorry for your experience in this matter Ricoh.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your game.<br>

Thanks for sharing your experience Sheana. It's really a shame that people have such attitudes. I've heard that log files and even screenshots aren't acceptable proof in these situations as they can be altered.... So It seems there's not much that can be done. However, I'm thinking of pulling a Paul Revere.. Maybe make a midnight ride through any zone I can, announcing that she is a KS'er. We'll see. <br>

After talking with their group I though the matter was resolved, until they came and sat down right next to us and pretty much ran us out of the area. Not wanting to go throught the whole petition and wait routine we simply packed up and moved elsewhere.<br>

Although I dont think it is fair to label a guild by the actions of one person, but it is quite possible this guild does not view kill stealing in the same light most do.

<br>
I think the point, ineptly stated as it was, is that Die Sonnenkinder may in fact be a European/German guild.  Due to their cultural and societal differences with the American gaming audience, they may not be as concerned with Miries actions as you or I would be.  They may consider the actions in a different light altogether.  <br>
<br>
Since most of us are probably unfamiliar with the Guild, we really can't make judgements against them.  For example, does the guild exist solely as a means for communicating in German ala Tri-Airs or some of the asian guilds?  Is Die Sonnenkinder a &quot;true&quot; guild in the sense that they are a family that adheres to a common philosophy?  Tri-airs had a bad reputation amongst the American player base on Lanys because they didn't police their members and because they play and, therefore, camp dungeons in our off hours.  Its not unusual to log in at 3 in the morning and find SolB 90% camped by non-american guilds.</font><P><b><font size="4" face="chiller">Kragar Frostburn - <font size="4" face="chiller" color=red>Second Covenant's Tuna Shamwich</font><br><font size="4" face="chiller">a kewl dewd_00 says "sow plz Jabekn!"</b></font><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#E5E5E6><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uplurlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PlurLanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://hoseroth.tripod.com/plurdot.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>h0x0r!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>1/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>6:56:44 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Mirie: Guild Leader of Die Sonnenkinder.

<br>
How can a guild discipline it own leader other than disbanding and reforming? Also another thing to consider is if the leader acts like this it is quite possible that she attracts like minded indivuals. For example Uzziel, one of Lanys's favorite sons, bounced around from guild to guild until he landed in the &quot;Monarchy of the Dead&quot;, whom nobody that I know of will trust.<br>

It's REALLY EASY to see if a bard is kiting something.

I had a WW very beat up once, usually a mob wouldnt care about anyone in their path except me then but it agroed another player... dunno if its a useful observation.. but perhaps she ran into its path or you ran it close past her... *shrug* .. maybe im all wrong too.. =) <br>
just a thought, no comment on who dotted what or who is guilty.. If you need any help with the WW camp send me a tell.. i like slow camps outdoors =)<br>

I saw him kiting.. so I didnt attack. So when it aggroed back on him I went on down the trail. Well he must have gotten too far away from it.. because a few minuts later I had a WW chewin on my Ivy. I stopped.. looked around.. No druid. So I killed it. Of course shouts of me KSing went through the zone.. I apologized of course. The druid was no where in sight and I stood there for awhile looking for him. ANyway.. WW are wimpy pukes anyway.. hehehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But from what it seems the WW was cast on before it aggroed. I have cast on people's kited mobs before on accident.. but didnt take me long to know not to kill it. Since the person being shitlisted nor anyone in her guild has come forth its hard to really know the other side to it.<br>

For those of you who went off on the whole German thing.. honestly I think you read someting into the original &quot;its a German Guild&quot; statement. There was no original refernece to that being a factor in anything. At least not from what I read. And I have met some awesome German folks who play EQ.

I have been aggroed on many times before by someone kiting a mob, and the first reaction is to hit it back,(not that I do, but it is a reaction) but I agree it does not take long to realize when someone else is kiting it especially when a bard song hits it we do light up the mob pretty good.. if she is level 40 somthing than that werewolf was hardly a match to her and was probably green,(it hit me, I am 40 and it barely put a dent in me) and for her to say she was protecting ME is kinda silly for someone to say about 1 green mob that takes 1 swing at you.  Most of us sitting on a wall watching, knows what is going on or can figure it out very quickly and will not hit back a mob being kited. Also if I do end up killing someones kited mob by mistake it does happen I cant say it ever happened to me yet, than the very very least if she felt like she was protecting herself  from death by a green mob..she would not have cared for the loot and it would have been polite to apologize for killing it &quot;hey sorry I made a mistake&quot;, but &quot;hey please loot it&quot;   <br>
I hope you get that werewolf and the loot your looking for and sorry that some people just ruin the moment sometimes and I am glad there is a board here to let others know of such actions. <br>

I played a druid and i've played a bard.  Kiting with a bard<br>
you never get to far away.  That's one thing to keep in mind.  If I'm druid first thing I do if I was 45 would be<br>
to hit lvl 25 with snare then dd it.  If I don't want to<br>
aggro it too much I dot it.  Just my 2 cents.<br>
