<br>
I order from Dominoes alot and I see there back seats full of red bags we aint talking 2 pizzas.<br>
<br>
The local paper add for Dominoes drivers is 12-14 dollars PER hour.<br>
<br>
Fortunatelly from what I have read the drivers here are clean cut groomed and dont smell like beer so I usually give them 2 dollars.<br>
<br>
Why only 2 dollars well cos of that huge add in the paper that says 12-14 per hour even if u only work 5 hours if u read that add and figure avg 13 a hour thats 65 dollars plus in 5 hours time even if u only hit 6 houses and avg 1 dolar thats still 71 dollars a damn day for driving in your car listening to the tunes smoking etc and going damn only 3 more hours till EQ.<br>
<br>
Now if you dont make 12-14 per hour that is not anyones fault, simply put I see a add that says u make that much.<br>
<br>
Now as far as this calling 5 mins before you close crap, wtf you dont make the store hours you work for a company that says you are open from x time till x time.  When I used to do tech support we stayed till the que was empty my shift was noon - 2am well guess what if we had probs and there was 275 calls in the que at 2am we had to stay till all those calls were answered I pulled alot of noon -4am shifts THAT IS THE JOB.<br>
<br>
The pizza ppl where I live I have called probly less then 5 mins before they closed and never had a prob getting a order they usually say ok were closing so finishing up the last orders it might be a hour or hour and a half, fine I want a pizza I will wait if I dont then I will go out. <p><img src="http://nerro-dahirro.iwarp.com/Nerrosig.jpg">

<br>
As far as being a shitty driver, I'm not. I clean up before work, pull my *only* pierce, and take my hair up under my hat. I'm polite when I get to someone's house (but if I'm cursing them all the way back to the store in my car, that's my business), I don't drive over your lawn, I carry change, I don't smoke, I get all your stuff before I leave, and I don't round the bill. Yes, I do inside work too, and the crew I work with loves me, so there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That said, every once in a while someone can get under my skin and truly fuck up my day. I don't take it out on customers, but I *do* have to vent eventually... well, either that or find something else that will help me calm down. Last night had vent stamped all over it, and rants and raves seemed like the perfect place to go for it.<br>
<br>
Domino's (yes, that's where I am now) has a 2 delivery limit, with a 3 delivery computer hard cap. We're stuck on a new system that the regional manager put in, causing orders to get out the door at an average of 35 to 50 minutes from the time they get to our store. They took out the tag printer when they put in the new computers too, meaning no more info-at-a-glance. We've got a new store manager, and many of the old crew has left as well. The store has no discernable rythm anymore, and we have entirely too many people that are new. Top this off with a newly operational phone center for our area, and you can see where (if you've been in the business) it's loads of fun. They may call you as a manager if it's late, but I'm the one they give shit to at the door. The way I see it, it's my job to do what I can to make it right so they don't have to call you.<br>
<br>
My old manager used to work at Little Ceaser's as well, they're the only place in town that does the delivery charge deal, and the only bit the driver sees of the $3 is the milage. Period. He told me he felt sorry for his drivers there because they never got any tips, because people always assumed that the charge went to the driver.<br>
<br>
I'm only a freak on the inside, so drop your gothy stereotype. I dislike people in general, and that should be readily apparant from several things I've posted in the past. My trenchcoat is warm (and that makes me happy, being the little desert rat that I am) and keeps me dry, and it looks tolerably good on me as well. I'm not anything out of the ordinary around here.<br>
<br>
I'm not crying about my job, I know it's better than being a manager, 'cause I did that for almost a year before I found something better. I kind of like the job, because I don't have to put up with anyone for more than 45 seconds at a time, I get my music, and I have a bit of pocket change left over when the night's out.<br>
<br>
Now, Domino's doesn't stop taking orders until we are *closed*. 11, or 12 at night depending on the day. They can, and will, send us an order at 11:59, and we have to make it and take it. Closing work is usually started 2 hours before shift's end with only 2 drives and a manager on, sometimes less, but whoever's doing the front isn't actually getting much done because whoever's makering pizza's getting stuff all over the floor. Badly timed orders can be a real pain in the ass, especially if every time you come in, there's another one waiting for you, and you're just getting farther and farther behind on the things you have to finish before you can go home, no mopping early either... we don't have a wet floor sign and nobody wants to be liable.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's not how it's supposed to work, but that's how it happens. <br>
<br>
One more thing to consider. Vehicle maintence. In six months, I've probably put about 10k miles on my car on the job alone. I've replaced (and I do all this myself to keep costs down) my back axle, 4 tires, 2 wheel bearings, a cv joint, cat, vacuum modulator, EGR valve, 2 brake cylinders, and all my brake pads and shoes. Yes it goes with the territory, but for all those of you throwing number around, it's something consider.<br>
<br>
That's mostly where my tips go, for those of you who may be wondering. That and a nice meal once a week. I tip based on service as well, and the people at Olive Garden make sure I'm taken care of. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I usually tip the somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-25% of the meal.<br>
<br>
My last job was as an air conditioning tech. Same deal as whoever mentioned queue work before. Pick up your calls in the morning, get off when you're done. They get you more as they come in over the radio, sometimes you're out there in the dark with a flashlight, sometimes you're done after a half day. Both jobs have/had their ups and downs.<br>
<br>
I wasn't looking for sympathy, or anything else. I was worked up after a bad night and just blew it off. I wasn't bitching about the job, but the people in this god-forsaken town. How this turned into a discussion about my job, I'm not sure, but hey... it's interesting. This *IS* rants and raves, and if you didn't like it, too bad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

That Commie “each according to his needs” bull just don’t cut it.  Your car payment is not a factor in what I tip you. (BTW, when I delivered for Dominos, I would have loved $1 tip average)  If you want more than $16 a moth, then cut expenses and/or get a better paying job. <br>

I work for Papa John's to make money so I can eventually back to school and finish my degree. I work 5 of the late shifts every week, so I get a good 35-40 hours a week. I also make a *minimum* of 15 dollars an hour. On Fridays and other busy nights this gets close to 20. Sure, it may be unfair that working a job that requires no skill and no knowledge whatsoever can pay so well, but I guess that's why I'm working there and making $2500 a month so I can go back to school.<br>

<br>
ohhh, lets go back to heidee....<br>
246 a month for a car? i am truely confused? what the hell are you rdriving to sell pizzas? saab? a new bug? <br>
<br>
good greif.. sell that car, and go buy your ass a clunker. if you are using your brand new car to deliver, you will be crying in the end... <br>
<br>
insurance.. 128? umm speed much? even when i was 16 my insurance was not that much, once again, get the clunker, get liability... car payment per month goes to 0, car insurance drops to 50... thats like 325 extra a month for you.<br>
<br>
rent 200, woot! that the deal of a century, i am guessing your electic, gas, water are all in that price? your building have anymore openings?<br>
<br>
phone 50..stop with the 1-900 numbers... local calls on a phone =25 a month.<br>
<br>
groceries..(now i almost shit when i saw this) 150 a month???????? get out! ! !  first off, you said yourself your in school.. so im guessin you get lunch there? breakfaast is just cereal, you work 5 nights a week, so your not home cooking those huge costly meals... 150? nope, dont think so.... <br>
<br>
school 160, ok, i can understand this... but if they are goin off your income, you qualify for financial aid. but even if you dont, ill give ya the 160. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
people shouldnt tip you because of your expensis's per month. <br>
they pay on the service they get. period. if they are quoted 45 min, call the store and your on  the road, but dont get there for another 20, guess what...you blew your tip.<br>
<br>
also, between me, my brother, and my 2 friends..we cover the main pizza chains... yes, it is IDEAL for them to only take 2 orders per trip, but when you get a no show driver, or 3 on the same street, ect... you take more than 2.  <br>
<br>
and...(see i can go on forever) every delivery chain has a map with an area.. the farthers point out from the store is 15 minutes..TOPS... making a 30 min round trip. 9/10 times, that house has a closer store they call. most of the orders are with in 5-10 min of the store. lmao, actually in my area each dominoes has another store within a 15 min drive. <br>
<br>
*sigh* and lastly, you keep bringing up about gettin stiffed once or more a night... not once, did you include the $3 tip... the $5 tip...ect... i have delivered on occasions, ive been stiffed, and my high was $25, granted it was only once... but still-i didnt complain bout it. (my driver did though, when he found out =P). as a driver, you must take the good with the bad... the $5 tip and the $0 tip.. they ave to 2.50. your lifes not that rough. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugalaanisolinari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galaani Solinari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 7:05:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Fucking Hate You ALL!</span><hr size=1> Damn anytime I see &quot;Carolsure&quot; on this board I wanna order a pizza now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><img src= http://perso.wanadoo.fr/cassandra.astro/images/Arachnsig.JPG><center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uaustriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Austriana</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.webdeveloper.com/animations/bnifiles/hot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>OMG Becky, look at her butt</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 7:37:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://austriana.50megs.com/images/monkay[1].gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Fucking Hate You ALL!</span><hr size=1> Carolsue, I will disagree with you on one point...my car insurance is $100 a month right now.

I have never had a ticket (ok, ok, I JUST got my first one like a week ago, so that doesn't count).  <br>

I have never been in an accident.<br>

I went to drivers ed.<br>

Why is it so high? Because I'm 20 years old.  And this bs about it being cheaper for females isn't always true...a friend of mine is a year older than me, he's been in 11 accidents and has had countless tickets, and his car insurance is only $300 a month...only $100 more than mine will be when I move to Atlanta (where he now lives).<br>

IMO, even though it's a little bit more expensive (and hurts my poor checkbook each month), it's worth it. If anything were to happen and I didn't have it, I'd be kicking myself. I also have a fairly new car (it's about a year and a half old, it's a 2001 model).  But of course, I made the decision to get that, and I can suck up the $272 a month payments.  It helps that I don't have to pay rent or utilities (I live in a family member's rental property. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  If I did have to pay rent, school and car insurance I would have gone cheaper. But by the time I move out of here (when I graduate), my car will be paid off. /shrug  I thought about my finances before I got my car, and looked at how much I was being paid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umustelafuro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mustela Furo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 9:21:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=74>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/sdspies/images/ferret-d.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Fucking Hate You ALL!</span><hr size=1> When I got my license at 17, my parents put me on their insurance plan.  I don't remember who it was (I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> think</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Allstate), but apparently it had some special deals for student drivers whose parents were brave enough to trust them.  I got deductions for taking a driving course, deductions for ranking in the top 5% of my class, and there was one more, but I can't remember for the life of me what it was.  With all that figured in, my insurance charge (for full liability, full coverage) was around $55/month for a 17-year-old driving a '95 Chevy Corsica.<br>
<br>
Now, hubby and I drive a '01 Explorer Sport.  We pay about $350/every 6 months for insurance, which averages about to around $58/month.  I'm 20 now (will be 21 in less than two months).  I think our carrier gave me a deduction at 20 for having been a licensed driver for 3 years.<br>

<br>
When we lived in Alaska, the drivers made somewhere between $15-20/hour... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> base pay</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  That's not counting tips.  Needless to say, we didn't tip those guys very much, considering hubby was/is military and didn't see any reason to give some guy extra money who's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> already</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> making <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> more</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than he was.<br>
<br>
Now in Texas, well, I don't know what they get paid, so I try to base my tips solely on the service I receive.  Did they arrive within the timeframe stated?  Yes?  Okay, have a dollar.  Are they well-groomed (hair brushed, pants not down to their knees)?  Yes?  Okay, have another dollar.  And here's the big one.  Did you come into my driveway blasting your stereo so loud that my windows vibrate?  Yes?  Okay, no tip at all for you.  No?  Have two more dollars, and a nice day.  The stereo is a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> huge</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pet peeve of mine.  If you don't bother to turn your music down when you deliver my food, it tells me that you have no respect for me or my neighbors.  Furthermore, it isn't my responsibility to pay for their brand new stereo.  *shrug*<br>

From my one night of pizza delivery before I was fired/quit, I learned that it is a shitty job that you look back on later in life and giggle about. Or working at a convenience store during the graveyard shift, or being the overnight DJ until you again get fired (but this time for trying to get laid on the radio, and drinking 40's).  <br>
<br>
These experiences are fun for later in life when you grow up, when you put aside the doc martins, take out the earrings, and put the bomber jacket in the closet.  Trust me, you are not hard core. Painting NIN on the back of your leather jacket will look silly someday (ok it already looks silly) when it fades and looks like you have "IIN" on your jacket.<br>
<br>
And dress differently, I will continue to point and giggle at you, <br>
