<br>
This is very interesting. Its no wonder why Michigan <br>
is so loyal to the big 3. <br>
 <br>
After seeing a short news listing on &quot;CNN Headline <br>
News&quot; regarding Ford and GM's contributions to the relief and recovery <br>
efforts in New York City and Washington D.C., I was prompted to see what the other <br>
automotive companies were contributing. I have never <br>
worked for an automotive company -- nor has anyone in my family. <br>
It is, however, the prominent industry here in Michigan. I also feel it <br>
is important to know which companies are there for us in a crisis. <br>
 <br>
I went to (the news, press release and philanthropic areas of) each of <br>
the companies web sites. If the company had several sites, I tried to <br>
visit them all. Additionally, I visited the leading news and automotive <br>
sites. As of today, one week since the attacks, this <br>
is what I have found: <br>
 <br>
 Aston Martin - Nothing. <br>
 <br>
 Audi - Nothing. Audi's web site states &quot;Audi News: <br>
 Always up to the minute.&quot; <br>
 <br>
 BMW - Nothing despite other press releases/postings <br>
 since 09/11/01. <br>
 BMW's web site states &quot;The news service from the BMW <br>
 Group: fast, informative and comprehensive.&quot; Last updated <br>
 09/13/01. <br>
 <br>
 Daewoo International - Nothing. <br>
 <br>
 Daimler Chrysler (includes Dodge, Jeep, <br>
 Mercedes-Benz and Plymouth) - <br>
 $10 million to support the children and victims in <br>
 addition to other <br>
 donations from their employees, dealers and suppliers.  <br>
<br>
 Fiat - Nothing. <br>
 <br>
 Ford Motor Company (includes Jaguar, Lincoln, Mazda, <br>
 Mercury and Volvo) <br>
 - $1 million to the American Red Cross, matching <br>
 employee contributions to the American Red Cross and 10 Excursions to the <br>
 New York Fire Department. The company has also offered emergency <br>
 response team services and office space to displaced government <br>
 employees. <br>
 <br>
 General Motors (includes Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, <br>
 Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saab and Saturn) - $1 million to the <br>
 American Red Cross, matching employee contributions and a fleet of vans, <br>
 trucks and SUVs. <br>
 <br>
 Honda (includes Acura) - Nothing. Honda's site <br>
 states &quot;If you're looking <br>
 for the latest developments taking place at Honda, <br>
 you've come to the right place&quot; and &quot;Informative. Timely. Credible. The <br>
 latest news on Honda can always be found right here?&quot; No press <br>
 releases/postings since <br>
 09/04/01 when the release boasted &quot;American Honda <br>
 Motor Co., Inc.  recorded its second best sales month ever in August <br>
 ?&quot; My search included: hondamotorcycle.com (other press releases <br>
 posted on this site since 09/11/01), honda.com, honda2001.com, world.honda.com,<br>
 acura.com and honda.co.jp. <br>
 <br>
 Hyundai Motors Group (includes Kia) - $300,000 to <br>
 the American Red Cross. <br>
 <br>
 Isuzu - Nothing. <br>
 <br>
 Mitsubishi Motors - Nothing. Mitsubishi-motors.co.jp <br>
 site states &quot;The latest news about Mitsubishi Motors.&quot; I also <br>
 searched mitsubishimotors.com. <br>
 <br>
 Nissan - Nothing despite other press <br>
 releases/postings since 09/11/01. <br>
 <br>
 Porsche - Press release with condolences posted on <br>
 the Porsche web siteon 09/12/01, but no contribution. <br>
 <br>
 Subaru - Nothing despite other press <br>
 releases/postings since 09/11/01. <br>
 <br>
 Suzuki - Nothing. <br>
 <br>
 Toyota (includes Lexus) - Press release with <br>
 condolences posted on the <br>
 Toyota web site on 09/14/01, but no contribution <br>
 despite earlier press releases boasting that Toyota had high sales in July <br>
 and August. <br>
 <br>
 Volkswagen - The employees and management created a <br>
 Foundation, funded initially with $2 million, to assist the children <br>
 and victims with humanitarian help including medical and <br>
 psychological assistance, rehabilitation and scholarships. <br>
 <br>
 I can only hope that it is an oversight by the companies that have not<br>
 made a contribution and that they will join the relief efforts. We have<br>
 the freedom to choose which companies we make purchases from and I, for one,<br>
 will make my purchases from and give my money the companies that are giving<br>
 their money to America at this time of need. I hope that you will, too.<br>
 Please forward this e-mail -- especially to anyone you know who is thinking<br>
 of purchasing a vehicle. <br>

Walterscott, I guess I am kind of confused.<br>
<br>
Are you implying that the American big-3 automakers would probably contribute this type of money, or some type of money if this same exact tragedy happened in...Korea?  Or Japan?  Or somewhere in Europe?<br>
<br>
...and that these other auto-manufacturers wouldn't contribute anything?<br>
<br>
The slight possibility remains that the reason the American car companies contributed....is because they are <b>American</b> car companies.<br>
<br>
I do agree with you that it is rather bad taste for the other car-company websites not to at least post their assumed grief over this tragedy, though.<br>

<br>
They probably wouldn't. Of course, since American car companies don't rely heavily on income from car sales in Japan, Korea or Europe...they probably shouldn't.<br>
<br>
Granted, some of the companies in that list don't have much of a marketshare in the US, Fiat for example. But if American consumers just didn't buy any Hondas next year, that company WILL be in trouble.<br>
<br>
Many of the companies on that list RELY upon income from US sales to stay afloat. So yes, there is a very good reason for them to take an interest in our situation. It's called good customer relations.<br>
<br>
Dumbed down: We buy from them, they don't buy from us.

Kytherion,<br>
<br>
I think you are absolutely correct.  A good number of those auto-companies would lose a lot of business, if they could not export to the United States.<br>
<br>
However, it just seemed like to me that Walterscott was trying to paint 'most other foreign' car companies as being heartless, cheap, and impolite bastards.<br>
<br>
It is an incredible thing to donate to this cause, but at the same time, it would really really surprise me if the big-3 <b>didn't</b> donate.  As a matter of fact, it also would not surprise me if one of the manufacturers donated, and the other two realized it would be bad PR not to donate.<br>
<br>
All-in-all, I am glad donations were made.  I am just unsure of the direction Walterscott was taking his remark.  Sounds like he is saying that the domestic automakers have hearts, and most of the import-automakers do not.<br>
<br>

I wasn't implying or saying that.  No where in my posts did I say that.  I'm just passing on information that I thought was somewhat relevant as I remember a discussion about cars a month or so on one of the general forums.<br>

My cousin works for all 3 in an outsourcing industry that provides the foam padding for the seats.  All of his product is shipped elsewhere for installation into the cars.  I forget if it's GM or Ford, but most of their cars are assembled in Mexico.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, all three Hondas I've purchased in the last 11 years were assembled in Ohio from parts that were mostly made in America.<br>
<br>
Sure there's good ol' Patriotic passion behind some of the donations, but there's also lots of marketing in a time where there is a very hard sell on &quot;American&quot; products.  Please don't check your brain at the door when making a purchase.<br>
<br>
Buy Honda.  More Americans will benefit from it than if you bought a Ford. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 11:16:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> I'd double-check that statistic about where the parts are made.  Assembly is one thing, but I have never heard of Japanese car manufacturers making actual parts here.<br>
<br>
Also, how much of a career path, beyond the line, does an American worker have in Honda?  I am honestly curious.  Don't forget, the reason Japanese companies build plants here is because it is *cheaper* than in Japan (I know that for a fact; we are the &quot;Mexico&quot; of Japan).  Lets also not forget that supporting Honda does absolutely zilch for the US GNP which is the direct measure of our economy and is the measure by which everyone gets to decide whether or not we have finally entered the dreaded recession that they all love predicting.  Don't buy American?  Sure, do what you want, but lets not try to pretend that buying foreign brands actually *helps* our economy because it doesn't.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;would our companies donate if this happened elsewhere?&quot;.  I am positive they would.  Disasters have happened in other parts of the world (natural and otherwise) and American companies have donated millions.  And it obviously wasn't about &quot;marketing&quot; since you have heard nothing about it.<br>
<br>
Too much cynicism is a bad thing.  Why isn't any of that cynicism turned on the companies that *didn't* donate?  American companies are donating for PR and Japanese companies *aren't* donating why, exactly? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubelgarbattlebiztch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belgar Battlebiztch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 11:23:34 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.lof.ukhq.co.uk/classmembers/belgar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Like the post.

<br>
As for GDP, the name of the company is American Honda Co.  They pay tons of taxes and are in our GDP.  Sure, the top of the company is in Japan, but there are huge numbers of Americans in management, not just on the assembly line.<br>
<br>
Sure, our multi-national corporations have donated in other parts of the world, but guess what?  They are in those markets, too, so those donations have a marketting effect there.
