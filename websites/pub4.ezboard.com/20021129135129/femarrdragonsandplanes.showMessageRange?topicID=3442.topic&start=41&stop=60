Are you so certain Chuk that the American forefathers wanted to build a Christian nation? <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.infidels.org/~godlessheathen/Founders.html">Quotes from the United States of America's Founding Fathers</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. It's also pretty foolish to suggest the only way a country can have ideals is to be Christian. <p>----------------------------------<br>

This country was founded by a Christian people, the constitution, congress, courts and the presidential oaths all mention God because they all believed in God.  Living in this country you have the right to believe in God, believe in any other diety, or to believe in nothing at all.  <br>
<br>
BUT.... this country was founded by Christians, if you don't want to pay a little omage&lt;spelling&gt; to the diety of the people that founded the country you live in NO ONE is stopping you from leaving.  No one is forcing you to believe, but i believe you are disrespecting our country by taking things like this to court.  <br>
<br>
If this case stands.....won't the constitution oaths of office for every government job, currency and all that stuff have to change?......can you imagine the price tag on that?.....you could prolly end world hunger with all that money.<br>

The Pledge of Allegiance<br>
A Short History<br>
by Dr. John W. Baer<br>
Copyright 1992 by Dr. John W. Baer<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
Francis Bellamy (1855 - 1931), a Baptist minister, wrote the original Pledge in August 1892. He was a Christian Socialist. In his Pledge, he is expressing the ideas of his first cousin, Edward Bellamy, author of the American socialist utopian novels, Looking Backward (188<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and Equality (1897).<br>
<br>
Francis Bellamy in his sermons and lectures and Edward Bellamy in his novels and articles described in detail how the middle class could create a planned economy with political, social and economic equality for all. The government would run a peace time economy similar to our present military industrial complex.<br>
<br>
The Pledge was published in the September 8th issue of The Youth's Companion, the leading family magazine and the Reader's Digest of its day. Its owner and editor, Daniel Ford, had hired Francis in 1891 as his assistant when Francis was pressured into leaving his baptist church in Boston because of his socialist sermons. As a member of his congregation, Ford had enjoyed Francis's sermons. Ford later founded the liberal and often controversial Ford Hall Forum, located in downtown Boston.<br>
<br>
In 1892 Francis Bellamy was also a chairman of a committee of state superintendents of education in the National Education Association. As its chairman, he prepared the program for the public schools' quadricentennial celebration for Columbus Day in 1892. He structured this public school program around a flag raising ceremony and a flag salute - his 'Pledge of Allegiance.'<br>
<br>
His original Pledge read as follows: 'I pledge allegiance to my Flag and (to*) the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.' He considered placing the word, 'equality,' in his Pledge, but knew that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans. [ * 'to' added in October, 1892. ]<br>
<br>
Dr. Mortimer Adler, American philosopher and last living founder of the Great Books program at Saint John's College, has analyzed these ideas in his book, The Six Great Ideas. He argues that the three great ideas of the American political tradition are 'equality, liberty and justice for all.' 'Justice' mediates between the often conflicting goals of 'liberty' and 'equality.'<br>
<br>
In 1923 and 1924 the National Flag Conference, under the 'leadership of the American Legion and the Daughters of the American Revolution, changed the Pledge's words, 'my Flag,' to 'the Flag of the United States of America.' Bellamy disliked this change, but his protest was ignored.<br>
<br>
*****In 1954, Congress after a campaign by the Knights of Columbus, added the words, 'under God,' to the Pledge. The Pledge was now both a patriotic oath and a public prayer.*****<br>
<br>
Bellamy's granddaughter said he also would have resented this second change. He had been pressured into leaving his church in 1891 because of his socialist sermons. In his retirement in Florida, he stopped attending church because he disliked the racial bigotry he found there.<br>
<br>
What follows is Bellamy's own account of some of the thoughts that went through his mind in August, 1892, as he picked the words of his Pledge:<br>
<br>
It began as an intensive communing with salient points of our national history, from the Declaration of Independence onwards; with the makings of the Constitution...with the meaning of the Civil War; with the aspiration of the people...<br>
<br>
The true reason for allegiance to the Flag is the 'republic for which it stands.' ...And what does that vast thing, the Republic mean? It is the concise political word for the Nation - the One Nation which the Civil War was fought to prove. To make that One Nation idea clear, we must specify that it is indivisible, as Webster and Lincoln used to repeat in their great speeches. And its future?<br>
<br>
Just here arose the temptation of the historic slogan of the French Revolution which meant so much to Jefferson and his friends, 'Liberty, equality, fraternity.' No, that would be too fanciful, too many thousands of years off in realization. But we as a nation do stand square on the doctrine of liberty and justice for all...<br>
<br>
If the Pledge's historical pattern repeats, its words will be modified during this decade. Below are two possible changes.<br>
<br>
Some prolife advocates recite the following slightly revised Pledge: 'I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, born and unborn.'<br>
<br>
A few liberals recite a slightly revised version of Bellamy's original Pledge: 'I pledge allegiance to my Flag, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with equality, liberty and justice for all.'<br>

If Under God is too offensive for you then subsitute under Allah,  under No  God, Under Buddha whatever floats your boat.  Why press the issue and take it to court?  <br>
<br>
As for the comment about it hurting a child, cry me a river.  We have all had to put up with teasing and everything else when we were going to school, the kids of today will be able to handle it.  As for the detention issue, see above example about inserting new words then said child would not have a problem.<br>

As Raed so elegantly pointed out the Supreme Court has already ruled on similiar cases and if it appealled to them then they will overturn it.  <br>

I just assumed it was always there… am I the only person who didn’t know that part was added in 1954?<br>
<br>
You’re supposed to think of The Pledge as an overall statement of unity, an oath that makes you part of something when you place your right hand over your heart and state those words every morning.<br>
<br>
I could see a few reasons to change the Pledge of Allegiance, too bad none of them actually exist. Maybe if it said, “…one nation under God, or get the fvck out!” or “…one nation under God, except for Negros!” but it doesn’t. The Pledge isn’t, and never was, inflammatory, derogatory or any other “ory” word. It’s non-denominational in it’s reference to a general “God” and not a Christian God or Zeus or Allah or Krishna.<br>
<br>
Seems some people feel slighted that a person or group in history put their views before everyone else’s, not everyone believes in God and therefore the statement should be removed. Sounds like a valid argument except… what about all the people who DO believe in God? I mean, it’s not like you can expect America to be the land of agnosticism. People kicked out of England for wanting religious freedom founded the US.<br>
<br>
You want “…under God” removed because it pushes it’s beliefs onto you, aren’t you then pushing your beliefs, or lack there of, onto everyone else? Hope you don’t belong to a <a href=http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=ymca>Y.M.C.A</a>, that stands for Young Men’s Christian Association, which, in Gloriana’s case, would be a double whammy(not a guy OR religious). But, once again, they won’t deny a person access if they aren’t a male or Christian. We should probably hang those damn elitists anyway!<br>
<br>
People should think of the Pledge as a one hit wonder, something you might not be able to sing in its entirety 10-20-40 years from now. But, much like the chorus of a popular song of long years past, you will always remember the important part… “…with Liberty and Justice for all.” If the government ever comes up short on those two words, I’ll stand right beside you to fight the power, until then – fvck off. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Secondly, personally I wouldn't be keen on saying it if I lived in the states, since I'm an agnostic. However, for deeply religious people of other beliefs (moslems, for example), I bet it'd be deeply disturbing to have to say that every day.<br>

And third, to Chukzombi, if your society can't figure out a better way to get people to behave honestly than to say &quot;because God says so!&quot;, sheesh. :-P<br>

Nice research on the history of the pledge.  I was unaware of the origins or the changes since it was originally written.  Thank you for sharing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I personally take great pride in saying the &quot;under God&quot; version of the pledge, but completely respect the right of those who desire to give their version without those two words.<br>
<br>
I used to have to say a school prayer when I was in elementary school (separate from the pledge, which I've always enjoyed), and would get in trouble for not saying it.  I was living in the Bible belt at the time.  I used to just skip the part about Jesus Christ, as he is not central to my own faith.  It was easier than trying to fight the majority, and I was only eight or nine years old at the time.  (Civil disobedience wasn't high on my priority list.  Playing kickball was. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  It always rankled that I couldn't say my own prayer (back then, everyone said the same thing regardless) and I have empathy for those of polytheistic religions or without faith that have heartburn over saying &quot;under God&quot;.  <br>
<br>
While I think the lawsuit wasted a TON of money that could have been spent on more worthy causes, it doesn't really matter now after the fact.  Tolerance is the buzzword of the times, and I definitely prefer us leaning in that direction over intolerance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As a side note, when you take the Oath of Enlistment &amp; the Commissioning oath in the US military, it used to be standard to say &quot;I swear&quot; (to God) and &quot;so help me God&quot;.<br>
<br>
Those phrases are now optional (and have been that way for several years).  Instead, you may say &quot;I affirm&quot; and completely skip the second phrase if that is your desire.<br>

When spelled with a capital G, god (in the western culture) means the christian god, not any other god.</font><br>
<br>
Well, since we(Americans) learn the Pledge somewhere around age 6, I think we can make up our own minds about who this “God” is, I sure as hell know I wasn’t told be some school teacher. When I learned it there was no Bible in the teacher’s hand, he/she didn’t point to a statue of the Blessed Mother in the corner and detail the birth of Christ… it was by no means a lesson in religion. It was an oath of loyalty to one’s country that just happened to use “God” as a unifying factor.<br>
<br>
My only exposure to religion at that age was via my Grandmother, a Catholic. Had my Grandmother been a Hare Krishna I’m sure I would have interpreted “…one nation under God” to mean “…one nation under Krishna”. Yep, I'm clever like that.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>Secondly, personally I wouldn't be keen on saying it if I lived in the states, since I'm an agnostic. However, for deeply religious people of other beliefs (moslems, for example), I bet it'd be deeply disturbing to have to say that every day.</font><br>
<br>
If I lived in some of those Middle Eastern countries, I would find it deeply disturbing that I couldn’t kick back with a Playboy or some other form of pr0n anytime I wanted to. But I would also understand that those laws were embedded into their culture before my grandparents were born. If I couldn’t deal with it I would move, not attempt to change the country to fit my beliefs.<br>
<br>
And who says they “had” to say it? If you don’t want to do something, then don’t... what a profound concept! <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

I don't know or care about the origins of the pledge or any religous implications or racial implications it may or may not have been intended to have.  When I say the pledge now it still ahs the same affect on me that hearing the national anthem does.  Simple pride and love of my country.  Regardless of what i was supposed to imply the only thing that really matters is what it means to you.  Just like reading the bible, its what YOU get out fo it that important, not what some one tells you it means, think for yourselves.  I have never been a religous person but i thank my grandmother, bless her heart, for taking me to church when i was younger so i could come to my own mind about religon.  As for the pledge, it always has and always will mean the same thing for me, regardless what some lawyers or magazine says to me its all about loving your country, the flag is a symbol of that country.  Every morning for 10 years i watched the flag go up played to the national anthem, and every evening i watched it go down to taps.  Its a symbol of a great nation regardless of its flaws, and a unique place and really a good place to live.  Look at the pledge as not to the flag itself but to the country it represents.  Not only that, if i say "god bless america" for any reason, that includes everyone, even me, a non-religous person.  No hidden agenda it just a show of hope or good will to anyone of your countryman or country.  <p>Assilem Soulvenom,Teir'dal Assassin

The government should not espouse ANY religion before others, that puts every citizen, no matter their religious beliefs on equal footing.<br>
<br>
I bet everyone of you that says if you don't like it, get the hell out is either a Christian or basically grew up surrounded by Christian beliefs.<br>
<br>
If you would take one second and put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim American citizen or a Buddhist American citizen or a Pagan American citizen, you might have a tiny inkling of why I feel this way.  Sure, you don't have to say the pledge, but isn't that pretty sad that the pledge is written so citizens feel uncomfortable saying it based on their choice of religion?  <br>
<br>
The United States Pledge of Allegiance, intended by its author to be a unifying pledge for all citizens is currently not so.  It is a pledge for those that worship and believe in God.  What about everyone else, are they less worthy because of their choice of religion?<br>
<br>
If you think nonChristians should shut up and get the hell out, then you DON'T understand what makes this country great.<br>

I guess that means that the 24th Amendment that repealed the poll tax (1964) isn't really a good thing either. How about the 26th Amendment that allowed those 18 years of age and older to vote (1971)? Surely they can't be old enough to be a tradition or a law.<br>
<br>
Everyone seems to be almost saying the same thing just in a differant way. The country is one that is diversified and that is what makes us great. If you don't want to say the Pledge you don't have too.<br>
<br>
What's next, you can't put up Christmas decorations on your home becouse someone on the block might get offended? For those that say you shouldn't put up any Christmas decorations on public land, remember my Christian dollars help pay for that land too.<br>

Remove &quot;under God&quot; from the pledge and it doesn't change the way people feel about their country or the way they feel about God, it just makes us all equal. <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/gloriana.html"><img src="http://fyd.fuxored.net/glorymedium.jpg" border="0"></a><p>
