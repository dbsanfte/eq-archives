OK, George, make with the friendly bombs <br>
The Bush files - Observer special n by Terry Jones <br>
To prevent terrorism by dropping bombs on Iraq is such an obvious idea that I can’t think why no one has thought of it before. It’s so simple. If only the UK had done something similar in Northern Ireland, we wouldn’t be in the mess we are in today. <br>
The moment the IRA blew up the Horseguards’ bandstand, the Government should have declared its own War on Terrorism. It should have immediately demanded that the Irish government hand over Gerry Adams. If they refused to do so - or quibbled about needing proof of his guilt - we could have told them that this was no time for prevarication and that they must hand over not only Adams but all IRA terrorists in the Republic. If they tried to stall by claiming that it was hard to tell who were IRA terrorists and who weren’t, because they don’t go around wearing identity badges, we would have been free to send in the bombers. <br>
It is well known that the best way of picking out terrorists is to fly 30,000ft above the capital city of any state that harbours them and drop bombs - preferably cluster bombs. It is conceivable that the bombing of Dublin might have provoked some sort of protest, even if just from James Joyce fans, and there is at least some likelihood of increased anti-British sentiment in what remained of the city and thus a rise in the numbers of potential terrorists. But this, in itself, would have justified the tactic of bombing them in the first place. We would have nipped them in the bud, so to speak. I hope you follow the argument. <br>
Having bombed Dublin and, perhaps, a few IRA training bogs in Tipperary, we could not have afforded to be complacent. We would have had to turn our attention to those states which had supported and funded the IRA terrorists through all these years. The main provider of funds was, of course, the USA, and this would have posed us with a bit of a problem. Where to bomb in America? It’s a big place and it’s by no means certain that a small country like the UK could afford enough bombs to do the whole job. It’s going to cost the US billions to bomb Iraq and a lot of that is empty countryside. America, on the other hand, provides a bewildering number of targets. <br>
Should we have bombed Washington, where the policies were formed? Or should we have concentrated on places where Irishmen are known to lurk, like New York, Boston and Philadelphia? We could have bombed any police station and fire station in most major urban centres, secure in the knowledge that we would be taking out significant numbers of IRA sympathisers. On St Patrick’s Day, we could have bombed Fifth Avenue and scored a bull’s-eye. <br>
In those American cities we couldn’t afford to bomb, we could have rounded up American citizens with Irish names, put bags over their heads and flown them in chains to Guernsey or Rockall, where we could have given them food packets marked ‘My Kind of Meal’ and exposed them to the elements with a clear conscience. <br>
The same goes for Australia. There are thousands of people in Sydney and Melbourne alone who have actively supported Irish republicanism by sending money and good wishes back to people in the Republic, many of whom are known to be IRA members and sympathisers. A well-placed bomb or two Down Under could have taken out the ringleaders and left the world a safer place. Of course, it goes without saying that we would also have had to bomb various parts of London such as Camden Town, Lewisham and bits of Hammersmith and we should certainly have had to obliterate, if not the whole of Liverpool, at least the Scotland Road area. <br>
And that would be it really, as far as exterminating the IRA and its supporters. Easy. The War on Terrorism provides a solution so uncomplicated, so straightforward and so gloriously simple that it baffles me why it has taken a man with the brains of George W. Bush to think of it. <br>
So, sock it to Iraq, George. Let’s make the world a safer place. <br>

As if there is a need to connect with people of like mind, taking for granted the levity of a situation and granting a personal enlightenment of opinions. To assume innocence and guilt by way of &quot;gut feeling&quot;.. to undermine the severity of a situation by becoming an obstacle of doubt, thus blocking and begging down the process of debate and rational deduction. An intelligent person does not sigh to such ramblings with a simple &quot;yeah..no doubt&quot;. But wished to take into account the reasons for such feeling. In other words, Why did you draw this comparison and based upon what?<br>
<br>
AMERICA THE BULLY:<br>
Everyone loves the Underdog. Everyone hates the big bully. Everyone loves the big tough guy when he fights on the side of good. So why is it when a country, such as America, gives billions of dollars every year, sends countless medical and food sources to less fortunate countries, has a proud and rich history of sticking its neck on the line and dying for others; do so many detest them? Perfection is far from any nation, yet blame for being imperfect, all the while assumed, falls on the shoulders of those who are carrying the heaviest load world-wide. Armchair critics stand selfishly ashamed and alone in the dark chasm of the hearts, all well knowing that their opinions and actions contribute nothing to this world...that when once drudged out, shows not only lack of concern..but a lack of hope. Take not your substance for those who are hopeless and sarcastic for they offer only a bitter and diluted verse of self-righteousness.<br>
<br>
WHAT TO DO?:<br>
If America is wrong...we will be dead wrong. I do not support an aggressive attack on Iraq if America stands to profit one dime. I do not support action unless it is proven to the entire nation that in fact they, Iraq, do indeed intend to do harm to America. However, you never know what one's intentions are until they act upon them....so you try and beat them to the punch...but if your wrong, apologies will not help.<br>
<br>
There is a huge stack of evidence that points to Iraqi involvement in regards to the Federal building in Oklahoma City. There is more public &quot;evidence&quot; about this then there is about Iraqis weapons of mass destruction. Why the US government will not address this is bewildering. But regardless of the &quot;tactics&quot; of national interest, by all means demand reason. The US, even knowing for almost absolute certainty that Japan was going to try something, did not attack until attacked. It is not the nature of the US to take over countries. Yes, our capitalism does indeed consume, but only with full respect to a nations government and people (its a polite greediness). Yet a new pipeline now under construction in Afghanistan, which was previously ruled out by the then Afghan &quot;government&quot;, does raise and eyebrow or two.<br>
<br>
Demand the proof! BS on &quot;we cant tell you cause it might give them the edge&quot;  Fook that! Demand to know why your husbands, sons, daughters and wives are going to die! Demand to know why the US is the aggressor and not the defender. Do not take any one man's word on it.<br>
