Finally someone got to the heart of the matter instead of pretending it didn't exist.  It didn't seem like such a difficult concept but now it is clear that some people have extremely low reading comprehension.<br>
<br>
Back to Trech now.<br>
<br>
"Childish yes. Ignorant? Id rethink that if I were you as I steadily beat your ass around this message board in my childish manner."<br>
<br>
I have rethought it and my conclusion remains the same.  The only thing you "beat" is your genitals.<br>
<br>
"For you, yes this is true"<br>
<br>
It is true for everyone.<br>
<br>
"argument at hand which you are clearly avoiding"<br>
<br>
The argument at hand was if a person's reputation has impact when they posted RUINING SOMEONES REPUTATION.  Did the caps help you read that portion?  Reputations are built from many sources.  I don't know the original poster at all.  My only experience with him is the one post he put here.  That is not enough for me to give any weight to his opinion on this particualar matter.  Geez you have a brain that would get lost in a gnat's ass.<br>
<br>
"I must be a heinous criminal then. Did those numbers next to my name tell you that"<br>
<br>
Another example of your stupidy.  Heinous criminals might eat cornflake too.  Does that make all cornflake eaters heinous criminals?  All it means is that eating cornflakes has nothing do with being a good or bad you feces licking miscreant.<br>
<br>
"JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO POST HERE DOES NOT MEAN THEY DONT COUNT!!"<br>
<br>
I never said this in any of my posts.  If they don't post here then the point is moot.  I have a hard time keeping a straight face reading your crap.<br>
<br>
"The number next to your name is a measure of how many times you have hit the "add reply" button. NOT how reputable you claim to be. "<br>
<br>
The NATURE OF THE POSTS does allow you to form an opinion of them.  If all you do is hit reply that is useless.  If the number next to your name is "1" then we know we cannot read any other postings you have made and therefore cannot get a feel for you at all unless we have experience of you from some other medium.  I keep saying the same things in different ways hoping it will eventually sink into your miniscule mind.  Have I succeeded yet?<br>
<br>
"Something in my posts means something to you cause you keep comming back. Do you love me??"<br>
<br>
Love is too strong a word but you are mildly entertaining as an example of what a lack of an education can do to a person.<br>
<br>
"Why are their accounts of in game experiences any less trustworthy than anyone elses?"<br>
<br>
If you know them then you have another basis to make that decision you ignoramus.  If you don't know them from Jack and the one post you see is ripping someone apart with no support whatsoever can you tell me that what they are saying is true you miserable vomitus mass?<br>
<br>
"I want you to pull your head out of your prison ridden ass and answer my question"<br>
<br>
You are such a class act Trech.  I have answered your question repeatedly but you aren't reading it.  If I fail to continue to post it will only be in frustration for getting information past your remedial reading skills.<br>
<br>
Caoilfhionn:<br>
<br>
If you have prior knowledge of a person you a basis to make a judgement on their post.  Are you claiming that if you do not know someone and they post one thing that they are automatically telling the truth?  My only objective here was to show that since most of use don't know the original poster from Adam, that such a harmful and reputation ruining post should not be given automatic credence.  I never claimed that a person with high postings was credible nor can you ignore personal experience with someone from other mediums.  I didn't claim any of that.  Frankly I don't know where you got it from.<br>
<br>
The run of the mill postings have no malicious intent, Trech's aside, or lasting effects.  One concerning a characters reputation, on the other hand, is a different matter in my mind.  I may not have been clear on that particular point at first but I felt it obvious as we are in a post regarding someone's reputation.<br>
<br>
By all means feel free to disregard my opinion.  You can go back and read my other 36 posts if you want to gain a better understanding of me, though I am not suggesting you do, but you do not have that option with Kyborras.<br>
<br>
Thank you for responding to my posts like an adult.

This forum was designed to report to the rest of us of potential scammers. Why the hell do I have to post 100 or so other times before I am taken seriously? The other forums have JACK SHIT to do with my reputation. I may spend my time in the damn roleplay forum telling stories about how I like to pull the heads off dwarves and shove them up my ass cause I am some big bad ass ogre. After a while I may have several hundred posts of this garbage. Does that mean when I come here to post about a scammer I am any more in the right or wrong? NO! You have absolutely no basis to make a judgement of my merits from my posts about sodomy and dwarf heads. <br>

Did it ever occur to you that maybe the original poster never had a REASON to come to these boards and post something?  Or that maybe they never even KNEW about the boards until they happened across it?  <br>
<br>
I never had a reason to come to the boards until I wanted to sell some shit I had in the bank.  I hate EC, so I came here to sell.  No one &quot;knew&quot; me from the boards.  I had a &quot;1&quot; by my name.  But tons of people know me in game.  Are they going to question any of my posts because I have less than a thousand posts?<br>
<br>
And my GAWD.... this is supposed to be a scammer thread.  Why the hell are we arguing whether or not the number of posts a person has warrants him or her to be believable?   Why should a number dictate to someone their credibility?  <br>
<br>
And how is a post about something that happened to someone going to ultimately effect the subject of said post and his reputation?  I believe that people have more common sense than that, and will weigh all the evidence presented before rendering their decision.  If you don't feel that way, then you may not be giving them enough credit.  But, like everyone else, you're entitled to your opinion.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to offer my point of view.  Whether the number of my posts appeals to you or not.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I don't see how someone's post count can add to one's credibility regarding a game.<br>
<br>
If I want to know how &quot;credible&quot; a person is as a gamer, I play the damn game with them.  That's how you know how they play and if they play clean or not.  <br>
<br>
I have interacted with people on the msg boards for a long while, but not once have I backed up an acquaintance whose reputation in-game was attacked.  I've never played with them, thus I have no opinion of what sort of player they are.  They could be the biggest sweethearts on the message board and the biggest morons in a dungeon- I'll never know.  Thus, I keep my trap shut.<br>
<br>
For me, interacting through the game and communicating through a forum are two completely separate things.  To say one's post count determines one's credibility is base, judgemental and incredibly superficial.  <br>
<br>
I may have 100+ posts to my name here on EMarr, but what does that say about me?  It says I have friends on this board I love to interact with, I have enemies here I love to piss off, I'm bored and I'm not playing EQ.  I don't see how any of those affect my credibility.  So if, let's say, Ghalewind came in and posted some bullshit and we see he has 100+ posts.  Does that make him suddenly credible?  How about Mistywolf?<br>
<br>
I fail to see how there is any connection between credibility and message board posts.  If you want real credibility, go out and group with the people.  It doesn't matter if you've interacted with them over and over again on a message board, you still don't know how they play the game, thus you are lacking sufficient information you need to make a formulated opinion.  Post counts mean shit.  I know plenty of hard-core, honest to God, fine players who rarely frequent this board.  Let me repeat myself.  Post counts mean shit.  Want a /real/ opinion?  Do the work and go play with the people on EQ.  <br>
<br>
People like you, Ogma, are dangerous.  You seem to think there is a way to formulate a valid opinion about a person's persona just through a stale number.  People used to think a person's religious affiliation could be measured by the number of moles on their body, and if they found one they didn't like, they hanged the wench.  Faith used to be able to be measured by sinking an accused woman of witchcraft in water.  If she drowned, she was indeed faithful, yet if she floated and survived, she lacked it and was indeed a soldier of Satan.  It's all the same to me.  It's all generalizations and assumptions.  But, it's those very generalizations and assumptions that are dangerous.  Why?  Because they are lacking in wisdom and common sense.  An ounce of common sense can do wonders, but I don't think you can understand that.<br>
<br>
I suggest you cease to reply, because you've already branded and labeled yourself a useless, superficial, and arrogant individual who has nothing useful nor positive to add to intelligent conversations.  Your rhetoric is ghey.  Your points are dull and lacking in merit.  You are, overall, blasé.  Your arguments cannot stand on their own, thus you change your arguments whenever it so suits you.<br>
<br>
Only the pompous, immature and ignorant believe the masses can be categorized simply to their liking.  Take that any way you wish to, but I'd prefer if you took it the worst way because that'll be closer to how it was originally intended to come across.<br>

<br>
I think Ogma is being seriously misunderstood.  If you go back and reread his posts before he got into the pissing contest with Trech, I think his actual point has been overlooked.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that what he is trying to say is this:<br>
<br>
There are many different ways to form an opinion of someone from EQ.  You can play with them in game.  You can have discussions with them here or on some other message board.  You can talk to others you trust and get thier experiences with the person.  Or you can read the things they have to say on this board.  Or any of a dozen other ways I am sure.<br>
<br>
If someone posts here, and that post basically asks you to change your opinion about someone or something else, you have to decide for yourself what to think about it.  If you do not know the poster, and no one you know or trust backs him up, all you have to go on at that point is thier other posts here.  Do they tell you anything about the poster, good or bad?  If there are no other posts to help you here, you have nothing to go on.  Therefore you should take everything said with a grain of salt until you can get it verified (if you even care enough to do so).<br>
<br>
This leaves us at the original point:<br>
<br>
The posts (or lack thereof) can HELP you determine your opinion (or lack thereof) on the matter.  But number of posts is by no means a fair way to judge someone.  If they have posted a lot previously, you probably have formed an opinion of that person's moral character.  Maybe.  That is up to you.  If they have not, and you have no other information upon which to act, maybe you should consider not judging anyone involved just yet.<br>
<br>

 My point was that multiple posts let people know a posters consistency and whether or not they are trustworthy. The people who post nonsense are known for it and so that is taken into consideration when evaluating their post as much as the people who write well thought out and mature posts. The old &quot;trust me&quot; line just isn't acceptable when your aim is to ruin the reputation of another, as the poster who created this thread is trying to do. Your reputation directly impacts the weight given to any post you write. If you have no reputation the post carries little weight IMO. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
disregarding the post count garbage...lets look at this objectively...<br>
<br>
First we have Kyborras posting here about someone named Corgon who he believes to be a possible scammer. By Kyborras's own words, Corgon looted an FBSS from guk and then /q'd.<br>
<br>
Second, we have Corgon, by his own words, admitting he did in fact loot the FBSS but went LD rather than /q'ing out.<br>
<br>
---following me so far?<br>
<br>
Ok now thirdly..Ogma comes on and starts to say that what Kyborras is posting is a false accusation because he is a first time poster. Yet when in fact Corgon came on admitting that this is partially true thus verifying the majority of Kyborras's post.<br>
<br>
(Following me still?)<br>
<br>
When one doesnt Roll on an item (which by both Kyborras and Corgon mentioned NO attempt to random) fully justifies a 'ninja looting' position. <br>
<br>
Then Corgon proceeds to say he went LD at a VERY inopportune time. Ok..now we have ALL heard this one, as well as the fact that &quot;My brother was playing, it wasnt me&quot; Story.<br>
<br>
Now by Ogma's own words &quot;The old 'trust me' line&quot; doesnt mean anything...Which I pulled out of context here to prove a point.<br>
<br>
 In Context He was using the &quot;The old 'trust me' line&quot; refering to someone who is posting a potential scammer and how that can ruin ones reputation with false Information. Which may be fine and dandy,<br>
<br>
But doesnt that also hold true for the one that IS the scammer and trying to cover his/her butt?? <br>
<br>
So far 80% of the original posters comments are true. After all, Corgon did admit to being there and looting the FBSS which also neither mentioned a random, which, like I said earlier can justify a ninja loot.<br>
<br>
Now this is where Ogma should have just left his mouth closed and this thread would have died a while ago.<br>
<br>
He started commenting on the fact that without a valid number of posts that will allow the rest of the community to form a valid opinion of the poster, than the poster is wrong, the original poster doesnt have his/her facts straight, and must be falsely accusing someone of the scam.<br>
<br>
Well, now looking at the facts at hand..like I said earlier..the only part that may be wrong from the original poster is the /q'ing part. That is really the only thing up for debate here, otherwise Both Kyborras and Corgon have pretty much the same happenings. <br>
<br>
So, Ogma...If both Corgons and Kyborras post are pretty much Identical(minus the /q'ing part of course) would that make them BOTH liars? Because they both have low post counts? Or just the fact your so full of yourself you cant read clearly?<br>
<br>
Now to Gieve, <br>
<br>
some people just dont post on these boards..that is FACT. If at one time someone in game really upset them, they come here and let the community know about the person that did, and then leave quietly. Is that too much to understand?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
If someone posts here, and that post basically asks you to change your opinion about someone or something else, you have to decide for yourself what to think about it.

<br>
If you read about what Corgon said..be basically backs up 80% of Kyboras post, like I said a couple times allready...all on the first page.. Well, that pretty much allows a person to form the opinion just from those words. Remember, everyone has heard the story of the bad timing LD, or the 'my brother was playing'. And that just really dont hold much water. <br>
<br>
Im not saying Corgon is a scammer... But anyone who actually READS the posts is gonna have some speculation about the proposed untimely LD.<br>

Or that either of them lied.  I don't know.  That is exactly the point.  I do not know one way or the other what the whole truth is, nor can I truly make an educated guess because I do not either of them well enough to judge their character.  Is that so hard to understand?<br>
<br>
I am aware most people do not post here.  I rarely post here myself.  My post count is low.  Does that mean that I am not to be trusted?  I hope not.  But for someone who knows nothing about me except for what I have posted on this board, I would say that person knows very little about me.  that person would likely have no opinion of me one way or the other.<br>

You would not have this opinion of me if I had not posted.  You have formed an opinion of me purely based on the posts here.  If I had not posted then you would have no basis to have any opinion of me.  Some of those opinions are damn strong too!<br>
<br>
If you really want to stop me posting the quickest way would be to stop attacking me.  I feel compelled to defend myself when attacked in any medium.  It is a common instinct.<br>
<br>
There have been alot of assumptions made and conclusions drawn from my words that are the result of faulty logic.  If I make a statement and that statement is true, it does not logically follow that the opposite is also true.  If I tell you that when I look up at the sky at night it looks black can you then make the assumption that if you look up at the sky in the daytime it is white?  Night is the opposite of day and black the opposite of white being the givens.  When I say that someone with a post count of "1" cannot be assumed to be telling the truth, I have not accused him of lying.  I have merely said that the truth lies in a grey area that cannot be determined without further information from some source.  More posts may not resolve that issue but then again they may.<br>
<br>
To Trech:<br>
<br>
"I refuse to respond to you like an adult because you feign maturity while having the logical thought process of a three day old fruit fly"<br>
<br>
you have judged me on my postings which proves my point.<br>
<br>
"This forum was designed to report to the rest of us of potential scammers. Why the hell do I have to post 100 or so other times before I am taken seriously?"<br>
<br>
You don't need post of 100.  All you need is a measure of credibility for me to take you seriously.  Why is it that you think it is okay for someone to post bad things about someone on this board but you deny me my right not to take it seriously?  I never said he couldn't post.  Visnet asked that the post be removed.  I merely supported the position that a post count of "1" leaves me with no basis to judge whether he is telling the truth or not.  I am forced to "take it with a grain of salt".<br>
<br>
"You have absolutely no basis to make a judgement of my merits from my posts about sodomy and dwarf heads."<br>
<br>
Yet you have still formed opinions of me by my posts.  This seems illogical to me that you could argue against something that you display so vividly.<br>
<br>
"You, however, think that somehow the numbers running up next to my name make me magically more delicious to the collective community here."<br>
<br>
No, the only number I have ever mentioned is the number "1".  I never stated that a high number gives you credibility but it may allow me to form an opinion of you.  If you had been posting about dwarf sodomy I would have thought you a freak and not paid much attention to your other postings.<br>
<br>
"For craps sake! You keep proving my point and refuse to stop posting! If reputations can be built multiple places why do you keep insisting on a good reputation this message board to be a qualifier to post about scamming?"<br>
<br>
I don't.  I just won't give the matter serious consideration if you are a complete stranger to me.<br>
<br>
"Stand up straight and quit trying to put your face in your own crotch. Its easier to read that way"<br>
<br>
Hey you're right that works wonders!  Try it sometime.<br>
<br>
"Is that the best you can do?"<br>
<br>
I don't know.  I haven't really tried yet.<br>
<br>
"You are digging yourself deeper. Why dont you and the rest of the useless fucks who want the post deleted just take it for what it is. A warning about a possible scammer. If you dont wanna believe it then dont. It has NOTHING TO DO with whether the person is reputable or not. "<br>
<br>
I really don't care if the post is here or not.  I have met Corgon in game but I have not met Kyborras so I will make my decision based on that.  If Kyborras had posted previously I MIGHT have had an opportunity to judge whether or not listen to him now.<br>
<br>
To Yanedanielle:<br>
<br>
"Did it ever occur to you that maybe the original poster never had a REASON to come to these boards and post something? Or that maybe they never even KNEW about the boards until they happened across it? "<br>
<br>
Yes it did, but that doesn't make what he said true no more than it makes it false.<br>
<br>
"I never had a reason to come to the boards until I wanted to sell some shit I had in the bank. I hate EC, so I came here to sell. No one "knew" me from the boards. I had a "1" by my name. But tons of people know me in game. Are they going to question any of my posts because I have less than a thousand posts?"<br>
<br>
I came here for the same reasons.  Was your first post about a scammer?  If not you point is moot as it does not parallel this situation.  Is it the people who knew you in game that you think I am saying won't trust you?  That is not what I was saying.  The center of my arguement revolves around whether or not you will accept a scammer report at face value with absolutely no previous knowledge of the poster.  I choose not to.<br>
<br>
"And my GAWD.... this is supposed to be a scammer thread. Why the hell are we arguing whether or not the number of posts a person has warrants him or her to be believable? Why should a number dictate to someone their credibility?"<br>
<br>
The number doesn't dictate it.  It is merely a statistic, but if you don't post and I don't know you in game then I cannot determine whether or not to believe you.  You may choose to accept everything you hear as truth but I am more skeptical I suppose.<br>
<br>
"And how is a post about something that happened to someone going to ultimately effect the subject of said post and his reputation?"<br>
<br>
If he is up for consideration for a guild then it would affect him I think.  Guilds can be very picky in the 50+ game and Corgon is 50+.<br>
<br>
"Have a great Friday!"<br>
<br>
Thanks, I will!<br>
<br>
To Aishen:<br>
<br>
"Boy, you don't know who you're fucking with in this thread."<br>
<br>
Yes you are absolutely right.  But lets see what conclusions we can draw about you in this one post.  It offers us quite a bit to chew on.  I am sure if I went back and read all your others I would find out even more.<br>
<br>
"I have interacted with people on the msg boards for a long while, but not once have I backed up an acquaintance whose reputation in-game was attacked."<br>
<br>
So we can assume that is in the future you may also do this.  Not everyone does.  I have seen verbal battles to the death on message boards supporting people that were unknown to the combatants except via message boards.<br>
<br>
"For me, interacting through the game and communicating through a forum are two completely separate things. To say one's post count determines one's credibility is base, judgemental and incredibly superficial."<br>
<br>
And yet you have drawn these conclusions of me by reading the message board!  Did you just call me "base, judgemental and incredibly superficial" based on what I wrote on the message board?<br>
<br>
"Does that make him suddenly credible? How about Mistywolf?"<br>
<br>
Nope but if they did I could read those posts and I may form and opinion that I believed they were trustworthy or full of crap based on those posts.  I do not have that opportunity with Kyborras and that is all I am saying.<br>
<br>
"Post counts mean shit. I know plenty of hard-core, honest to God, fine players who rarely frequent this board."<br>
<br>
Okay so you know these people.  I may not know them.  Should I then automatically assume that everything they may hypothetically post is the truth when I have to experience with them in game or out or even in the real world?  My point was only that if I had no experience with the person I shouldn't have to take everything they say as gospel.  I don't think you are really reading all the posts.  I understand they are long but you are responding with questions that have already been answered.<br>
<br>
"People like you, Ogma, are dangerous."<br>
<br>
Thank you.  I kind of like that.<br>
<br>
"You seem to think there is a way to formulate a valid opinion about a person's persona just through a stale number"<br>
<br>
Um...no that isn't it at all.  You really haven't read all this have you?<br>
<br>
"People used to think a person's religious affiliation could be measured by the number of moles on their body, and if they found one they didn't like, they hanged the wench. Faith used to be able to be measured by sinking an accused woman of witchcraft in water. If she drowned, she was indeed faithful, yet if she floated and survived, she lacked it and was indeed a soldier of Satan."<br>
<br>
Actually this was true for both men and women.  Both suffered judgement and death in this fashion in history.  The fact that you center in on women gives me the impression you are a feminist.  Am I right?<br>
<br>
"An ounce of common sense can do wonders, but I don't think you can understand that."<br>
<br>
Actually I have been saying that for years.<br>
<br>
"I suggest you cease to reply, because you've already branded and labeled yourself a useless, superficial, and arrogant individual who has nothing useful nor positive to add to intelligent conversations."<br>
<br>
Branded myself with my posts!  You have managed to once again prove my point!<br>
<br>
"Your rhetoric is ghey."<br>
<br>
You don't like homosexuals?  Is that right?<br>
<br>
"Only the pompous, immature and ignorant believe the masses can be categorized simply to their liking."<br>
<br>
Yes I agree you can't make snap decisions without weighing all available information.  Have you done so regarding me?  I don't think you have.<br>
<br>
"Take that any way you wish to, but I'd prefer if you took it the worst way because that'll be closer to how it was originally intended to come across."<br>
<br>
Now you're just being mean.<br>
<br>
To sum up my current opinion of you I think you are a feminist who doesn't like homosexuals and do in fact judge people by what they post on message boards despite what you say.  You don't completely read long posts or don't put forth the effort to understand them and would like me to go away because you think you are better than me.  Did I guess right on any this?  In counterpoint I hope you do not take this in the worst way as I don't wish harm on virtual strangers.  I was merely trying to prove my point.<br>
<br>
To Darue:<br>
<br>
"Ok now thirdly..Ogma comes on and starts to say that what Kyborras is posting is a false accusation because he is a first time poster."<br>
<br>
No I did not say it was a false accusation.  I just said I could not determine its veracity.  It falls in the grey area of "take it with a grain of salt".<br>
<br>
"So far 80% of the original posters comments are true. After all, Corgon did admit to being there and looting the FBSS which also neither mentioned a random, which, like I said earlier can justify a ninja loot."<br>
<br>
I can't accurately calculate the percentage of points in common.  It really depends on what you are counting as points.  Corgon did confirm much of the original post AFTER this whole discussion started about credibility/believability.<br>
<br>
"He started commenting on the fact that without a valid number of posts that will allow the rest of the community to form a valid opinion of the poster, than the poster is wrong, the original poster doesnt have his/her facts straight, and must be falsely accusing someone of the scam."<br>
<br>
Nope you were correct up to the point that  you said I said he was wrong.  I never said that.  I only said I couldn't tell if he was wrong because I'd never heard of him before.  You made the rest up.<br>
<br>
"the only part that may be wrong from the original poster is the /q'ing part. That is really the only thing up for debate here, otherwise Both Kyborras and Corgon have pretty much the same happenings."<br>
<br>
I agree.  That is the point of contention now after multiple postings on this issue.<br>
<br>
"So, Ogma...If both Corgons and Kyborras post are pretty much Identical(minus the /q'ing part of course) would that make them BOTH liars? Because they both have low post counts? Or just the fact your so full of yourself you cant read clearly?"<br>
<br>
No neither one neccessarily has to be lying.  Kyborras could merely be mistaken.  It is you who has not read it clearly.<br>
<br>
To all:<br>
<br>
I will keep posting if you keep attacking.  We seem to be nitpicking now on imagined things I have said.  Many of you have inferred things not implied or imagined I said things I did not.  You really aren't responding to me now but about things you are inventing about me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrechdashadowknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trech Da ShadowKnight</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 364<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 7:49:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.stormofdragons.com/images/jjwalker.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Finally</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Actually Trech, calling someone a scammer in public effectively is asking you to change your opinion of him, weather you do or not is up to you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I guess somebody wasn't around for my misogynistic bitch rant.  If calling someone &quot;ghey&quot; can lead to conclusions that label oneself homophobic, then I'll rightly assume that calling someone a stupid bitch (such as yourself) insinuates that oneself is zoo-phobic.  I'm sure /you/ know what a zoo is.<br>
<br>
Yes, I formulated those opinions of you by reading the content of your posts.  Note the word &quot;content.&quot;  I don't see how you can compare me forming an opinion of you based on your content and you asserting an opinion can be formed by a number.  And yes, I read your bullshit.<br>
<br>
If you really want to formulate an opinion on an individual, get off your goddamn ass and log onto EQ, track the fucker down, then talk to him.  It isn't his/her job to make sure gheydork_03 knows him/her through the boards.<br>
<br>
Now, my question is this.  If I actually had a life and I rarely frequented the boards, which forum should I go to to up my post count so you can have a basis to judge me by?  General?  But, what if I have 100 posts to my name, but I've only used the Item Bazaar?  I don't think you can formulate an opinion of me based on my WTS posts.  But then again, wtf do I care?  Do I really care what Ogmadork thinks of me?<br>
<br>
How many posts should I put behind my name before I'm allowed to warn people of possible scammers in the scammers forum without random fuk-fuks like yourself telling me I haven't enough credibility to post there?<br>
<br>
Here's my next question.  Which forums are restricted to people with less than a certain number of posts to their names?  And what's the breaking point?  At what number am I considered &quot;credible?&quot;  Does it mean more to the EMarr community if Aishen at 500+ posts gets scammed than if Poor_Dude_01 with 2 posts gets scammed?  If Caliss (I'm just using him because I know he doesn't have many EMarr posts to his name) comes here and reports a scam, is his report less credible than boo-boo-lazy-Aishen's report?  While I'm surfing the internet, he's raiding and grouping.  I'll be damned if people have more of an opinion of me than him; I'm rarely on EQ anymore.<br>
<br>
Answer each question.  I dare you.  <br>
<br>
And, yes, I'm very mean.  But, I'm only mean to people I believe are inferior and have little or nothing to add to the world.<br>

Trech model 2001 comes with a fully functioning gaydar"<br>
<br>
From what I understand most gays have gaydar and most straight people don't, but I am sure you are just an exception.<br>
<br>
"Correct. And to further validate my point I, as most everyone, would take you more seriously had you never opened your pie hole"<br>
<br>
Thats my point.  Stop trying to steal them.  So what you are saying is that everyone would take me more seriously if I had never posted but then if I had never posted there would be nothing which to base any evaluation of "seriousness" on.  That is illogical.<br>
<br>
"Fight your instincts"<br>
<br>
They are my instincts and I will do as I please with them.  You just worry about your own.<br>
<br>
"Id take what you say more seriously had you never opened your mouth. It is better to be quiet and to be thought a fool...."<br>
<br>
If I had never opened my mouth how could you take me seriously?  That is another illogical statement.<br>
<br>
"Why does that credibility have to come from this computer based forum? If you havent had any interaction at all with me then just take it as a warning, head it or not, and move on"<br>
<br>
Credibility does not HAVE to come from this computer based forum for me but for this post I have no other basis to make a decision.  Fine, it is a warning that I will not assume as true which is all I was ever saying.  Why do you keep insisting I said that Kyborras couldn't post here?  That wasn't me you are confusing me with others.<br>
<br>
"I am a freak of the highest order"<br>
<br>
Agreed.<br>
<br>
"YOU GOT GAME ON ME!! SCORE!"<br>
<br>
I know.<br>
<br>
"Further validating my point"<br>
<br>
That is my point Trech, but I am glad you agree.<br>
<br>
"Yes you would. And the things you would find out are how she acts on this message board. Aishen rocks"<br>
<br>
She rocks because she has a high number of posts?  Isn't that what you were arguing against earlier?  My whole point revolves around the fact that without prior experience with the poster in ANY way, shape or form I can not take it as truth.  That is all I said.  This whole thing seems to have started on inferences read into my posts that I never implied.<br>
<br>
You keep judging me on my posts.  My inflamatory remarks were only what I felt to be a directly porportional counter-attack only without profanity.  The will continue that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unekiahdragonsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nekiah Dragonsbane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 434<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/01 10:18:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well now...</span><hr size=1> It seems in your little jihad on the importance of post counts, you got lost in your own little tide of strung together phrases defending yourself, to defend your topic.<br>
<br>
A post count is merely a representation, and while you do indeed hold merit in that people with single digit post counts of course hold the same weight as anon's, you should realize, by your own acclaimed wisdom and intellect, that posts don't matter, good posts do.<br>
<br>
Posts that change the tide of converstations, or break arguments. Not petty lines that require a string of text and an add reply.<br>
<br>
The webbing of this community works because we read what we write, and understand how to thread apart those who speak with clarity and brilliance, something that I hope you someday learn to do. <br>
<br>
Now, you can refute this of course, because the post in question didn't require this. But, you're the one defending the integrity of post counts, not merely this one. You've also invoked the torment of several posters who indeed (like you stipulated) have a notority for their posts, and the value of what they say, or at least how they deliver it.<br>
<br>
It's apparent you want that. Learn to string together ideas concisely, and not drag on forever, annoying everyone. As it is, you're just begging us to call in the vultures, if only to silence you.<br>
<br>
Aim for the eyes, my pets<br>

um..dude..*sigh*...ya might really want to RE-READ the thread...wait..NM...let me point it out for you.<br>
<br>
Read Post #4 dingleberry<br>
<br>
Ok..now your down to a he said she said thing about the LD directly from the FIRST FOUR  posts. Seeing as how that can be a common excuse, it would be VERY EASY to derive to just watch out for Corgon. PLain and Simple..<br>
<br>
Or better yet, how bout you and me go on a dragon raid.../smirk I can go LD too. Or My brother can be the one at the controls.<br>
<br>
So your whole Idea of not listening to posters who have no name on these boards, who happen to be one of the 2k people you havent met in game, who seem to hold no credibilty, can still pretty much sum up what happened in the first post he makes only to be backed on the fourth post by the person he is posting about. Yet you can come here and say it isnt true because YOU have never seen him before, have never seen him post before, have never developed an opinion of him before.? But yet Corgon himself holds most of what was written as valid (minus the infamous LD)<br>
<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA...now THATS funny!<br>
