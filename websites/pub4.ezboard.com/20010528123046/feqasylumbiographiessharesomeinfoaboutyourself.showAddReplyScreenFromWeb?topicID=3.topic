But I will be glad to help.  The first step is to go down to your local Air Force Recruiting station, and ignore the squids and jarheads as you walk into his office.  You have to fill out a ton of paperwork and such, but your recruiter will be more than happy to help you with that.  A while before you leave for basic, you need to have a complete physical done at the local MEPS (military entrance processing station) and get shots and all that good stuff.  Then you will get your EAD (estimated arrival date) for Basic Military Training.  Between now and when you leave, you must have as much fun with your friends and your girlfriend as you can possibly have, because your life is about to change.  When you get to basic, you're gonna think &quot;Well, I can't do this, I guess I'm just gonna have to leave cause there's no way I'm doing this&quot;.  Well let me tell you something.  When it finally hits you that there is NO escape, and NO way out, you would like to impale your recruiter's head on a stick cause he lied to you so much.  Six weeks pass like almost no time at all, you are miserable and crying every night.  You won't eat for the first 3 days cause every time you put food in your mouth you will get nauseated.  You won't be able to take a dump for about the first 2 weeks (don't ask me why, it happens to everyone), and guys, you may not believe me but imagine this:  Have you ever gone 6 weeks without the little general popping up for a visit?  It will happen!  That's right, NO wood for 6 weeks.  Women are the last thing on your mind.  Anyways, as time passes, you change and before you know it you are wearing your blues on graduation day.  It was all worth this.  When they start talking about you being in the Greatest Air Force in the World, you will get tears in your eyes.  You have changed for the better and you wouldn't have it any other way.  After this you're off to Tech School! Tech School is kinda like college, everyone is your friend and also, the men aren't the only ones that haven't got any for 6 weeks, so that's not even a problem.  After tech school, you get your orders to your first base assignment, better hope it's not Cheyenne Mountain AS, CO.  You should definitely try going overseas.  That's about all I got to say about that....if you have any other questions let me know.

Imagine being in Boot camp from 6-12 weeks (Air Force 6, Army 8, Navy 8, Marines 12) with nothing but guys in your room all night long (about what 30-40 in 1 big long room with no doors or anything).  Would you like to have to deal with that AND your male hormones running wild?  They put a chemical in the food (they will deny it though) that actually lowers the sex drive.  For those that go in the Navy you will get this chemical for most of your time at see and it will stop being given around the 1st week or so before you go into port.  This is what will lead to your low morale standards in at least the Navy (hey when a chaplin &lt;religous officer&gt; goes out to get some from a hooker cause his wife isn't there what do you expect?). <br>

Most say it is the water.  I think it is a myth.  The reason you don't get wood is beacause you are stressed out and scared as hell.  Around the fourth week, you, or someone you know may experience the wonders of morning wood.  When this happens..there is much celebrating and everyone is happy!  You'll hear, &quot;HOLY SH*T!

I loved tech school..there were still alot of rules and limitations in what you can do...but gradually you get more freedoms.  When you graduate tech school and get to your new home station, the sh1t hits the fan.  You are free...you are an adult.  If you joined right after high school like i did, you will soon realize...I'm on my own and i can do almost anything i want.  Prepare to get drunk...underage or not.  The first weekend i was in the dorms....i awoke at 3am to someone banging on my door.  I popped my head out to see the hall full of drunks.  I heard, &quot;hey..there's the new guy&quot;.  I'm handed a beer and am the center of conversation and curiousity at the moment.  Be warned, if you are underage and drinking, don't get caught.  I was caught, its not fun.  I got off lighter than what i deserved, but i've seen people bite it hard for underage drinking and DUIs.  Drinking isn't condoned by the Air Force, but it seems to be an unspoken tradition.  If you go overseas, it is legal for you to drink.  I've been in countries where you are old enough to drink if you can see over the bar.  Imagine seeing a 12 year old boy sipping on a beer and smoking a cigarette.  I've seen it...it's funny.  DOn't go crazy either....people will screw with those who are passed out drunk.

The Kosovo &quot;conflict&quot; was only because we stuck our big nose in the middle.  And there wasn't that much of a problem.  Heck my Aunt went there to sing for the Military men.  She happens to be a country singer who has won many awards in the Country Music Association.  When they bring civilians over to a place where there is a &quot;conflict&quot; then there really isn't one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP-->   However there was the chance.  The military has it's place and it is not to be policing other countries.  But that is my opinion.  And as for what I stated above.  Well I have had several friends AND family in the diferent branches.  Heck my own Dad was in the Air Force doing computer installations for most of the underground areas and stated that except for the spit and polish there wasn't a whole lot to do and it was easy.<br>

Now saying the Air Force is easy just because your uncle installed some computers in some secure areas is stretching the truth.  I am a computer/network technician and a communications specialist.  My job is hardly spit and polish.  When my unit is called to deploy, exercise or real life, I set up the mobile LAN.  I'm expected to do this rain or shine, totally safe, or bullets flying.  I don't lay the cables in straight neat lines, making the network layout look pretty.  I lay lan cables on the bare earth.  I have to have the network up and running in 24 hours or less without mistakes.  This includes programming routers, setting up a hub or two, making then running the CAT5 from tent to tent, from hub to computer.  Then you add in MOPP levels.  For the civilians out there, MOPP level determines how much chemical gear you put on.  Wearing a chemical mask, luging around an M-16 prepared to use it, laying cables in the dirt, usually shivering from cold, or sweating like a pig from the heat.  Its not fun, its what i get paid to do.  I would love to be like your uncle and set up computers in the air conditioned buildings, sitting at desks instead of kneeling in the dirt.  DOn't stereotype the whole Air Force just because your uncle says his job was easy.  Ask your uncle if he has ever worked 2 24 hour shifts, a few 16 hour shifts, and the normal 12 hour shifts all in a weeks time?  Your uncle sets up computers that stay there a while.  Imagine setting up all the things i described above, only to tear it all down, then start all over the next time you are called.  Now it seems like I am on the opposite end of the stick than your uncle.  Remeber both extremes and everything in between.  We both do the same job, but do it differant ways, for differant reasons, and to accomplish differant missions.  </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#E5E5E6><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uedrana.showPublicProfile>Edrana</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Global user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>4/12/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>7:55:32 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Air Force</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Said it was my father to start with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>

And he did have to do a lot more work than just sit behind a desk.  But that work and the work YOU are describing is still easier.<br>
<br>
Talk about 2 weeks plus of getting no more than 2 hours of sleep.  How about 6 months of that straight?  When in the Navy I was expected to Work my normal shift.  Do my normal watches PLUS assist in the board of ships every night.  Total sleep a night on average?  2 maybe 3 hours sleep (and people wonder why my sleeping habits are screwed up now).  BTW assisting the board of ships is while fully armed rain shine OR hurricane.  My ship even went through a Hurricane and thought it was a submarine (thank god for emergency reverse).  But we can compare the good with the bad all day long.  What matters is this.  Are YOU happy with what you are doing?  Do you go to bed filling satisfied with your job?  I know I did while in.  Stopping literally 500+ million dollars of drugs from entering the US was a create pat on the back if you ask me.  But what I even enjoyed more was spending time in Columbia with a bounty on my head and not giving a rats ass about it (that invincible thing ya know what I mean?).<br>
<br>
But if you want to know the kind of work my DAD did I could tell you.<br>
Sheep Farm in North Dakota. (you should know about it if you have TS clearance)<br>
The mountain base about 3 hours north of las vegas (you know the one that has a dirt road dead ending into a mountain side).<br>
Those kind of installations.  Yes he had TS clearance and he did this over 20 years ago and I know things change.<br>

What my grandfather did in the army.<br>
CIC or as it is now called CID.  Central Intelligence Corp (Central Intelligence Division now).<br>
<br>
My other Grandfather was in the army.<br>
Don't know what he did as he won't talk about it.<br>
<br>
My uncle was in the Navy and was a sub bunny as I call them.<br>
<br>
Me..  I joined had the chance for a semi cushy job being a nuke but didn't want to grow wings and glow in the dark <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> .  They tried to push me for some reason.  Think it was Ace'ing the calculas test and never taking calculas in school.  Or maybe it was my 87 ASVAB and answering every question including the 150 math questions in 3 minutes.  I just hate the big buttons during that test or I could have gotten a 95+.  BTW I finished each of those tests with no less than 1 minute of time to lay my head down and rest after getting 3 hours sleep the night before.<br>
<br>
Trust me I know what the military can do for you.  And I did speak very highly about the Air Forces college programs.  I have also had several friends who were in the air force and went through bootcamp with guys who were in the air force prior and washed out of Naval Boot Camp (which is easy.  do 100 push ups and 100 sit ups at the blink of an eye and you can pass the final physical test by walking the 1.5 mile run).  Air Force is not as physical a job as the other branches are.  They pride themselves on brains not brawn.  Marines pride themselves on brawn not brains.  Navy and Army try to fit in between.  And that is what I was trying to get across.<br>
<br>
I apologize if you misunderstood my original post but reread it.  And honestly the Air Force is the EASIEST branch to be in as long as you like the politics.<br>
<br>
BTW how big is that Lan?  And are you putting the cat5 in shield tubes or?  Reason I ask is I am into networks myself and run a 10/100Mb network at home.  10Mb to the cable modem(modem only does 512/512 though) and 100Mb between the computers.  I have a 16 port 10/100 auto sensing hub with a built in switch.  I am also going to school to get my certs saying I know what I know right now.  ITT CNST course.  Teaches routers(which I don't know yet) and the basics of each OS so you can network it (except the loser MAC Os that no real computer user uses &lt;EG&gt;).<br>

You mentioned your aunt in the previous post, so was thinking aunt and uncle.  Yes, I have a TS clearance.  As a matter of fact, i have a special category TS clearance.  I have to admit, i've never heard of the specific bases you mentioned, with the roads going into the mountains.  There are alot of things I don't know about.  Your father probably had a special category TS too.  I find it kind of exciting to know alot of things hardly anyone else knows about.  It is really cool to learn something that gets put in the news 2 weeks later.  <br>
<br>
As far as the LAN I build in the field is concerned.  Nope, we don't run the lines in tubes or anything protecting them from the forces of nature, or being stepped on and tripped over.  Sure, sometimes something gets yanked, but we fix it.  We use the outdoor CAT5.  It is a bit more rugged, and has some kind of grease inside that surrounds the pairs to waterproof it.  Really sucks to work with, especially when trying to put connectors on.  Sounds like you got a good setup at home.  Personally i just have a 56k modem and a phone line! *L*  I haven't had any formal classroom training on routers, but have learned a good deal about them.  Still, i'm going to take some CISCO classes.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#E5E5E6><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=badan>Badan</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Local user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>4/19/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>9:43:27 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Military and LANS</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Boy you just hit home with me.

<br>
I spent 8 years in the US Army begining with a 2 year run with the 82nd Airborne, then  was accepted to the SF &quot;Q&quot; Course and after i graduated spent the rest of my time with Bco 2nd Bat 5th Special Forces Group. You whine and complain about Air Force Basic training? Try Jump School at benning for 3 weeks, try the &quot;Q&quot; course for 6mos with &quot;Pre Q&quot; for 30 days prior to that of running 12 miles in the morning with a full ruck then at 4pm running another 10 miles without a ruck and painting bullshit rocks white inbetween. That was jsut to weed out the ones who didn't hae the Intestinal Fortitude to endure the Main event. There is nothing in the marines that comes close to it, the only thing out of ALL the srevices that is harder is of course BUDS training, but after hell week BUDS/Q Course are about the same, just different tactics.I got to see and do alot of stuff that I'm proud of like being on the only SF &quot;A&quot; team to jump into grenada, training sandanista rebels in Honduras, Spending a month in a cave in Laos opperating a DLP (Dynamic listening Post) monitoring the Vietnamese militaary channels(but we realy weren't there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     ) Spent a Week in bangkok sampling the local cuisine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     and going to Tai Boxing tournaments. All in all a really fun time.<br>
<br>
As for Air Force Basic Training... *Snicker* what a joke. 6 weeks of Vacation time before you begin your real vacation at your PDS (permanant duty station).  I spent alot of time on Pope Air Force base (they ahd the best chow. Period) and flew alot of miles. But for some reason i took off in about 50% more planes than i landed in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       <br>
<br>
Anyway. all bullshit aside, if i had it to do over again, i would have went into the air force instead. They have the best work hours, best food, best raining (for civilian job market. I got good training with SF but there just wasn't a calling for A Light weapons/Urban warefare expert. *shrug*) <br>
and best living conditions. But no matter what branch you choose, I applaude anyone for joining the service, it is a good and honorable way to mature and make money for college.<br>

Anyone considering going into the Army, go airborne. Best training anywhere, and you get to jump out of perfectly good airplanes. Yeah, the uniforms are on the tacky side, and you do have to hump an ALCE pack around for sometimes days at a time, but the memories, responsibility and maturity gained can't be beat.<br>
Oh, and chose a specialty that corresponds with something in civilian life. Nothing worse that filling out a resume saying your qualified for killing people. Not much call for that nowadays...heh.<br>
