And you should reread that post, Warbird. He lists his name and specifically said he remade the character. Chances are it's with the same name.<br>

You're a pathetic liar and a poor excuse for a guild leader. Here's to hoping your guild doesn't exist come two weeks from now.<br>

You admitted to training the other group then returning to loot the corpse of a MOB they killed once the timer expired.  You then refused to return the item to them despite the fact that you were well aware that they, and not you, had killed the chance and not only that you sat there camping the corpse while your train finished them off and didn't help even when one of them was FD'd right near you with very low HP.  Obviously you didnt help because you were after that prod whether you earned it honestly or not.  You've proved yourself to be a loot whore of the lowest variety, willing to rip people off and let them die by your actions.  Not only have you earned your spot here but you've reinforced the accusations against you through your own posts.<br>

Anything else that happened is simply icing on your shitlist cake. The original reason you're on this list is for what you yourself have admitted to. Just based on your own posts. So ONE PERSON claims you have a history of this...so what? You admitted to doing it the one time, then attempted to justify it. Was it wrong to do?

Well, I don't want to be a man, I'm happy being a woman, thx info -la, la ^^<br>
And dueling you would not only be no challenge for me, but why would I want to have anything to do with you at all? It would be quite simply a waste of my time, and provide you with the attention you so apparently crave.<br>
<br>
<br>
But please, by all means continue posting. It does provide amply entertainment on a slow day. My personal favorite is how you continually tell people to cry you a river and stop smearing your warpaint, and time and time again you post whining yourself. <br>

At first I was extremely upset that this excuse for a person could have ruined a perfectly good day for myself and my group.  However, as time passed I said hey, he was shitlisted, he will have a large number of people that read the posts and determined for themselves what happened and whether they wanted to deal with Warbreed, Ghorall (yes, I actually know the people I abuse or group with, take a note Warbreed), Dominoe, or myself.  Yes, I put all of us on this list as we take as much publicity as Warbreed in this list.  However, I personally learned of many people here that share the same beliefs as myself and therefor would love to group/work with online anytime.<br>
<br>
As for your innocence, we don't evencare anymore.  You screwed no one but yourself.  The 3 of us managed just fine the night before this incident and killed the Chancellor without a spear.  We can go back in anytime and get this again, however it is nice to know many would help.  /bow Thank you all, we are a ways off from needing the HS keys so not a hurry for us just was bored that night so figured as he was up again we would try.<br>
<br>
Your good name, huh.  Noticed it isn't as good as you say.  I do not blame Colindar for not mentioning more then his current name.  It may have been his old, may not but it still means something.  He has been playing EQ some time from the sounds of it, maybe not since release two plus years ago, but who cares if or if not.  Warbreed, you seem to believe all is told by the level.  I disagree.  Such is life, everyone has an oppinion.  You try to change everyone's oppinion as it isn't the same as yours, but deal with it.  You can come back here, slam me, be clueless as to what actually happened that night, or straight-faced lie.  We don't care.  My (and seems many more here) believe you are scum of EQ and hope for the day you leave our server and hopefully this game entirely.  This is my oppinion and the views expressed here do not neccissarily represent the beliefs of VI or the general EQ populace.<br>
<br>
Oh, did anyone else see the two (???) posts for Warbreed?  I must have been reading them wrong, but my take on them was simply that this was not against VI policy.  Nothing there about you being right Warbreed, but hey, I will re-read them and maybe in the process get a good enough laugh to make me smile a little more at work Monday.<br>
<br>
Warbreed, I would not waste my time dueling you, if EQ was PvP or based from the get go to be that way you would have been rooted whenyou trained us and I would have helped the chancellor kill you.  As for now, the only contact I have with you is on this board as in game, I reserve my time for people who have a clue.  Check back on this post, from the beginning.  You might see, the story as it was from all 3 of us (the only witnesses besides yourself as all your friends/guildies were still at zone when you looted the corpse) and you might see Ghorall did not die, I did not die.  Only Dominoe died to your incident.  I have since helped her get the level she lost back, actually earned her something to aid as she was only there to help me.  If you sincerly wanted to appologize to her (let alone all of us as you say you tried) you would have offered her a little of your time or something that could aid her, not some silly trinket to try to appease a 'newbie' like everyone who is below your mighty level.  If level is all that matters to you, perhaps you will be a little more cautious as some are not what they seem.  That little 42 lizzie you were so proud to kick around, he now is a level above you.  /snicker  Go ahead, judge whatever you like but take your pathetic lies to another game, maybe solitaire as your play style is doomed to be judged, shitlisted, and treated with utmost hostility!   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umedievalelement.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Medieval element</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/11/01 11:30:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1>  I never noticed this post i am in Warbreeds guild i never knew what kind of leader we had... i planned on leaving reluctantly until i read this now it seems like the best idea so im out of this guild thanks for the posts really opend my eyes <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukrazrussian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KrazRussian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/11/01 1:14:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1> He's a guild-leader.

unless the warrior pulls onto a group, and then cleans up the mess?<br>

Not saying it is that type of guild, but having Warbreed as the leader makes the guild seem a bit shady.  <p><center><img src="http://twols.homestead.com/files/wilsig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueqkov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EqKoV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/24/01 11:22:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1> Hello Everyone,<br>
I just wanted to let you know Warbreed has left EQ, I have deleted my account and there is new leadership for &quot;Knights of Vengeance.&quot; What I did in the past should hopefully not reflect on the guilds future for I am no longer part of their family. I hope everyone here the best life has to offer (online and offline) and I know many will rejoice at my leaving. Yes I am an arsehole and I do not hide that fact, but good luck to all!!!!<br>
