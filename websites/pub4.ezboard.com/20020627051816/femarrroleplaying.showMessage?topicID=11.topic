Told in the form of a tale it took place upon the morn of Wednesday May fifth in the year of ninteen hundred and ninety nine (Eastern Standard time).<br>
<br>
     <br>
    It was all started in the early morning, being a person of the night I awake at dusk not dawn like most people.<br>
<br>
    Leaning against a tree in Greater Faydark I slowly opened my eyes from sleep alert and anxious to get the day started. Scanning around I noticed none of my friends had awaken as of yet. So I prepared to head into Crushbone Castle alone and see what grief I could give Ole Emp Cruish's legions.<br>
<br>
    Heading down the hill I passed the Priest of Discord who was at this time shouting about the death of some unfortunate.Seeing as glaring at him didnt seem to bother him.  I continued on my way heading towards the far lift that was half buried into the mountain on the far side of Kelethin nearest the orcs. <br>
<br>
    Just as I was casting woodskin upon myself and hefting my scimitar to head into the fray I heard the soft whisper on the wind......ahhh recognizing my good friend Zilvyn's voice (a high elven cleric)I paused my progress and asked if he was up for a bit of hunting. As soon as I heard what he had to say I was invigorated it was time to see some new sites aparently he had gone wandering into Lesser Faydark and had found a pillar that was being guarded by mummies and after scouting the area and testing the might of a few himself he came seeking help to destroy them. <br>
<br>
    So off it was to meet Zil at Felwethe and head into Lesser Faydark to rout the vile beasts. Upon entering the Lesser Faydark we were ambushed by a pair of bandits and after a brief struggle we crushed the life from them. After a brief search we came upon the area we noticed another group resting having tried to take the pillar but falling just short for there was a mummy left and they had had to retreat less they fall to it. Glancing at the group I noticed they were a full 6 strong and had not been able to finish off the last one. Snorting in contempt at not finishing thier task Zilvyn and I proceeded to show them true valor as we strode in just the pair of us and made short work of the bandaged monster. <br>
<br>
    Seeing that the other group was still around and that it was graced with 2 clerics that were prepared to spend the night trying to finish the job and sanctify the ground we decided to explore the area some more seeking the bandits we had encountered earlier. After crossing a few hills we encountered a mammoth spider queen that quickly jumped Zilvyn. Surprised by the sheer size of the beast he backed away to collect his thoughts and coming around from behind him I hacked at the beast to distract it while Zil collected himself. <br>
<br>
    Boy I tell you that was a mistake I think we should have turned and fled but I was in a rightous set of mind and was bent upon taking the beast to task for jumping my friend but I soon realized that Zilvyn's natural fear of spiders (which is understandable) had affected him a little more than usual (he overcomes this fear and uses it as energy to sustain him normally) but the sheer size of the beast and the quickness it had attacked had left him a little sluggish in response. Noticing this and feeling the effects of the many wounds from her poison laced fangs I backed away trying to heal myself and this finally snapped Zil out of his shock and he healed me himself and then waded into the creature but she would not be disuaded and ignored the real threat of Zilvyn hacking at her side and continued to pursue me as I desperatly scrambled up a hill trying to heal and defend myself all at once but alas twas in vain as the spiders poison and the mauling took their toll and I fell to the ground life seeping from my corporeal form. <br>
<br>
    I awoke naked in Greater Faydark my goddess protecting me from final death but removing my spirit and reforming it back outside Kelethin almost the exact spot I had slept in the night before. <br>
<br>
    Meanwhile seeing me fall must have driven Zil a little over the edge for ignoring grevious wounds himself he battled over the spot where I fell and slew the beast even though after she fell her touch could still be felt in the poison coursing his veins....her fangs almost reached from the grave and took his life as he slowly succumbed to the poison only to finally be able to cure himself at the last possible moment. <br>
<br>
     After reaching the site of battle and picking up my equipment which lay in a heap from whence my material form dispearsed and my spirit fled I thought back to the safety some of us enjoy of protection from death to a certian extent but the price we pay in having known the pain of the death touch and the mental pain of the last portion of your memories being ripped apart as your spirit flees to its focus point. For one thing I am not sure we have it better, the pain is excruciating and to remember it and know it could happen everytime you go into battle is a test of wills. One which most fail to choose instead taking solace in the final embrace of death. <br>
<br>
    I have heard it said that Deaths embrace is the softest of all and having felt it briefly and forcing oneself to make the journey back I cant say I disagree it is tempting everytime......<br>
<br>
    But I digress, so picking up my things we heard tell from another true friend Lowki a wood elven ranger who had just awoken and we made plans to go to The steamfont mountains and see if we can halt Meldrath a little and kill some of his minitaur slavers. <br>
<br>
    Lowki told us he'd catch up with us there and for us to go on ahead so we did just that heading thru the pass into the mountain range we paused at the Mills, Great Big Wind Mills the gnomes made to power thier machines. <br>
<br>
    Knowing this area from past travels we knew what to expect and planned to help out the mill workers and patrol the area around clearing it of the kobold scouts, skeletons and pumas which plague the area. Normally I would leave puma's alone but in this area they run rampent overpopulation having caused them to be extremely feral and attacking all livinng things.  For the benefit of thier kind they need culling and however unfortunate a job it is also one of the tasks set forth by Tunare. <br>
<br>
    After an hour or so of this Lowki finally caught upto us and we headed out.  <br>
<br>
    Following the mountains to the mine entrance. Here we encountered resistance immiediatly A Minotaur slaver was just inside and after a little scramble (he noticed Zilvyn and jumped him before me and Lowki were set) we dispatched him. <br>
<br>
    Moving deeper into the mines we stopped and rested a moment. At this point we were rather in a dangerous spot, in the mine we could be cut off from the exit if one of the roaving minitaur patrols returned. <br>
<br>
   So Zilvyn decided to scout ahead and just after the first bend He was acousted by 2 slavers.....not good as he fled towards us he yelled to run and head back to the Mills for reinforcements and that he was right behind us. <br>
<br>
    So off we went but me and Lowki decided to add a small twist and at the entrance we headed left and waited till Zil came out and ran to the right towards the mills and safety and Sure enough just on his heels were two Hulking brutes waiting a heart beat and then sprang up behind them giving chase. The amount of noise they caused more than covered any we made and soon we were right on thier heels and as we hoped 1 was a little behind the other just enough so that when we were far enough from the mine we jumped the last one taking him off Zil's heels without the other Slaver noticing who continiued pursuit thinking it had backup. <br>
<br>
    After a back and forth struggle with me Calling forth Natures fury and Lowki hacking like the madman he is in fact so furious was his assualt that he made the beast turn take and try to run away but alas to no avail as I joined Lowki in melee and we finished him off.....actually I believe the killing stroke was Lowki's he seemed possesed that night. <br>
<br>
    At this point we headed to find Zil and see how he fared but we had no need to worry as the timely arrival of the watchman combined with Zil's own skills proved more than a match for a lone slaver. At this point we heard the unmistakeable voice of Storrm our high elf wizard friend coming in upon the wind and bolstered by his magic we headed into the mines with renewed vigor. After a hour or so of plundering the outer mine area another group entered the mine and between the 2 groups mino heads were rolling left and right. <br>
<br>
    Until the other group emboldened by thier own deeds went deeper into the mines ignoring our warning's of danger. Soon it became apparent what a mess they stirred up. It all started when they came running out with a few mino's on thier tales and as soon as we dispatched one another took its place it seems they must have triggered some alarm for after about five or six slavers and when we were totally exhausted out poured a half dozen or so more reenforcements from deep within the mine As we were the group to handle the greater bulk of the mino's and being slightly deeper in the mine (they ran past us) we caught the brunt of this assualt full on and all hell broke loose quickly trying to fight our way to the entrance Lowki valiantly kept the rear guard taking hit upon hit as Zilvyn and I tried to heal wound upon wound. Soon it becam apperent that if we didnt break and run soon none of us would live. Making our way with no pretense now it became apperant Lowki wasnt going to make it seeing this for himself he turned into the mass of bull heads and went down swinging refusing despite the odds to give in. This bought Storrm Zil and I time to get out and so we did with all possible haste thanking our friends courage in our hearts as we tried to get free so his sacrafice would not be in vain. <br>
<br>
    At this point I was wounded grieviously and was limping along as I came to the entrance I turned to see how Lowki fared and was Astounded to see him backing out of the mine with slavers all around him fighting tooth and nail but at last the indomitable will that kept him going could not ignore the body that was not respoonding and he fell before my eyes seeing the tide of minotaurs I knew I couldnt make it far wounded like I was so instead of heading for the mills I tried a desperate ploy and climbed left away from the mills and my friends up the mountain hoping that the hooves of the beasts would aid my escape or if not at least by time for Zil and Storrm. <br>
<br>
    Unfortunatly I was not able to get away as I succumbed to my wounds 100 feet from the entrance but whether or not my ploy worked Zil and Storrm were able to get to safety. Having reapperaed in Gfay I joined up with Lowki for the long run back to The Steamfont Mountains and we headed out Lowki tracking so we could avoid any hostilities. At the mills I camoflauged me and Lowki so we could retrieve our equipment and we met back up with Storrm and Zilvyn at the mills to think of a less painfull way to go about this. <br>
<br>
    Our plan was this, we would limit our bloodlust and just go after the roving patrols in the valley outside the mines. So we settled in waging our own personal war on the Meldrath's slaver patrols. Soon both Storrm and Lowki grew tired and camped out there Storrm just needed a brief nap and Lowki having been adventuring all day was camping for the day. So it was back to just me and Zilvyn. Being a little more cautious we decided to fight elementals a speciacalty of mine and the lone slaver whenever we could corner one. <br>
<br>
    This went on for several hours until Storrm woke up and we continued with a little more safety for he does add a signifigant punch with his Battle Magic. I tell you the 4 of us make a good team I am a good offesive and defensive caster and a fair healer, Lowki is a mad man with a sword and if your thinking of running he will just track you down, Storrm provides a signifigant offesive punch able to level small hills with his magic(I just sometimes wish he'd hit what he was aiming at instead of the hill heh) and Zilvyn is a powerfull healer and Defensive caster along with being able to put the undead to rest with little effort add to this the rest of The Outcasts (Old guild name) whom we didnt see last night and what we lack in numbers we make up for in stregth and dedication. <br>
<br>
    Soon Zilvyn's eyes strayed closed and he camped for the night.  So Storrm and I proceeded at a more cautious pace......unfortunaltly not cautious enough as we found that two giant rogue clockworks can ruin a druids career fast and if not for Storrm jumping infront of the last few blows and the timely arrival of the watchman I would be looking at another long run from Kelethin. <br>
<br>
    But our troubles didnt end there as soon after Ebony Drake sent me zooming thru time/space to kelethin and if not for a lucky root storrm to would have joined me. Think you it ends here your wrong as what I cant remember either an elemental or minotaur (my head was so fuzzy from the constant wrenching pain I endured I forget) sent both me and Storrm back to Gfay. <br>
<br>
    At this point frustration mounted and I headed into the tree city for supplies I was thinking about revenge and not walking and I slipped off of a bridge and fell to the ground below....lucky for me I have quite a hard head and I was merely knocked unconious for a brief time and awoke to find myslef looking up at the platforms above. <br>
<br>
    At this point I almost called it a night...I almost just lay there and fall into a deep painfull sleep(you dont fall off of a 50' suspended bridge and not have a few aches). But alas I could not leave storrm to go back alone so I picked my self off the ground and went back up into the city(yes I know I ask for it) and bought some food and water and headed to Steamfont AGAIN. <br>
 <br>
    At this point I was quite familiar with the terrain and it passed in a blur only to stop in front of my things. I will say now that although as hard as it was I am glad I got back up and continued after that brief foray into pain reality set in and we settled into a comfortable routine.<br>
<br>
    Then we met a Dwarf named Deken or Delken (/ooc forgive me if you read this but I was working on 3-4 hours sleep from the previous day when I had got up at 3pm and it was about 10 am already and I couldnt see straight and the nodoze was wearing off) And we proceeded to hammer on Ele's and Mino's. <br>
<br>
    Soon though the fun ended and Storrm and Delken decided to camp. So I headed to Gfay and back to my original intentions Annoy the legions of Crushbone. And I know for a fact that I anoid them but I am not sure who was anoid more them at me or me at the fools that were with me in Crush who decided to make the Black Burrow gnoll hordes look like playthings as people seemed to think they could go in and push the Orc Trainer around and were unprepared when he pushed back.......the only thing that I couldnt understand was after the fifth or sixth time they would figure out that the trainer is tough. <br>
<br>
    Guess they cant understand this so unfortunatly I met my demise four times but I persevered and finally acomplished my goal of the evening I had honed my skills sufficiently for The Heartwood Master to proclaim me fit for new responsibilities.  So ends a day of running and adventuring!!! Triumphent in my quest I went to the fields of the young and healed and shielded the fledgeling warrior's,wizard's anf others hoping to share a little of my joy. So ends this tale my friends as ever it is long and drawn out but eventually all comes to an end even my tales. <br>
                                                         Till next we meet in the Great Circle my friends I bid you adieu,<br>
