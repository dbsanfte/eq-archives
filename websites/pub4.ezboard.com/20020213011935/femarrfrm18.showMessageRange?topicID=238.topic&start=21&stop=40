By the way I don't think anyone is jealous of Bill.  Pretty cheesy childish arguement to imply that if we hold him accountable we must just be jealous.<br>

Presidents lie, everyone makes mistakes, but the fact remains that when you take risks you pay the penalty.  Clinton was treated unfairly, his ass should be in jail.. purjury is purjury.<br>

<br>
Looks to me like Billy would be in some fine jailhouse company.<br>
<br>
On a related note, I hear Bush Jr. may, or may not, have jerked off to a Victoria's Secret catalogue last week. We'll have to convene a special comission for inquiry, and make double damn certain he didn't wipe himself using an official White House hand towel.<br>
<br>
We can't have this kind of moral decline in our leadership. Or is it that we can't allow partisan battles to obstruct the flow of government in the most powerful country in the world?<br>
<br>
Can never keep those straight. Damn liars, can't stand 'em. Makes you wonder why the founding fathers didn't make it so only priests could be elected president.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, now I remember. <br>
<br>
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE FUCKING STUPID.<br>
<br>
Because in a country where most people are so infantile that they believe the president should serve as a personal father figure, lying to people is a good idea if you want to keep your job. Because in a nation where the business of government can be halted in order to interrogate a president over a cumstain, lying is an even better idea if you want to keep your job. Because whether a sitting president is boffing an intern, a goat, or the entire cast of the Mormon Tabernacle boys choir, is none of your fucking business. And if self-righteous, self-appointed moral inquisitors didn't make it their business, maybe we'd have a snowball's chance in hell of electing someone who wasn't a professional liar. <br>
<br>
Possibly the only two honest men in office during the 1900s were TDR and Truman. Neither were elected, they were both VPs when the sitting president died. It is doubtful that either one of them would have won had they run for office.<br>
<br>
If two candidates stood for election, odds are you'd elect the liar and not the honest man. Because the liar tells you what you want to hear, rather than what you need to hear. Do that for a hundred years, and it's amazing what kind of filth will inhabit your presidency.<br>
<br>
I don't blame the Democrats. I don't blame the Republicans. I don't blame Bill, and I don't blame Ronald. I blame the ridiculous children who have demanded that the president behave like a Sunday school teacher whenever he's not running the most powerful country in history.<br>
<br>
We haven't had a sane, responsible president in decades for a reason...mostly because catering to the individual emotional, intellectual, spiritual, moral, ethical, political and legislative whims of over 225 million people is a waste of time.<br>
<br>
Honest people can't elected anymore. We've made damn sure of that.<br>
<br>
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go subpoena the President's hand towels. I can't WAIT to find out which catalogue model gives him the best wood.<br>

He could have plead the fifth, but he didn't. He took the stand knowing full well what questions they would ask... and he intended to lie.

I always love reading/hearing the sort of above statements. Care to elaborate Cendan why Bill Clinton was more &quot;evil&quot; than GW Bush, Jr.? You don't think GW Bush is getting blow jobs from someone other than that ugly sow he calls a &quot;wife&quot;? You don't think that he has the world's best economists tipping him off on where to invest his money?! Really, I am interested. What is the &quot;great evil&quot; that Bill Clinton did? Get a blow job? Make some money? I look forward to your enlightened reply. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
Answer to whom? You're missing the point. The president should NOT be answerable to congressional authority for personal conduct in his personal life.<br>
<br>
Lying under oath, cutting the tags off mattresses, running with scissors, trading arms for hostages, fucking interns and/or Marilyn Monroe, spitting on the sidewalk...I don't give a shit. We have elections here, Cendan. If you don't like who wins, wait four years and try harder next time. <br>
<br>
The president is supposed to be under congressional oversight in the event of serious criminal activity...NOT congressional supervision for any reason at all. A steadily weakening executive branch is what this country cannot afford.<br>
<br>
And it's exactly what we've been getting since the end of WW2.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate the pricks that say they shouldn't have asked Clinton so its okay that he lied.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer. We've trained these men to lie, they can't get elected without doing it. It's gotten to the point that they can't even stay in office without doing it. You're just as responsible as the pricks you hate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, hello... you can argue all you want about if they should have asked.  It all comes down to the fact that they DID ask and he lied under oath.&quot;<br>
<br>
He is the man elected to provide executive decision-making for four to eight years. He is NOT the man elected to provide moral guidance.<br>
<br>
Conservative or liberal, I FULLY support a president who lies to a Congress which oversteps its authority. It may not be the resistance I'd like to see, but it beats the hell out of seeing a presidency, ANY PRESIDENCY, subjected to Congressional inquisition at the whim of party machinations.<br>
<br>
The buck stops at the president's office. Not Congress, not your house, and not mine. Harassment of a sitting president for anything less than an absolutely capital transgression is, in my opinion, unacceptable. As long as we continue to do it, we'll get nothing but liars and yesmen in the position.<br>
<br>
I'll take the liar over the yesman any day of the week and twice on Sunday, and it hasn't got a goddamn thing to do with the economy. It has do with being the goddamn president, rather than a Congressional whipping boy.<br>
<br>
If it's not clicking for you, look up 'checks and balances' in a history book.<br>

Go jerk off to your slick willie poster.  Its people like you who support people like clinton who make us a joke to the rest of the world.

Prosecute!</span><hr size=1>      I swear cendan hasn't read a full post here. So to make his job easier Bill Clinton lied and i don't think he's the motherfucking antichrist. So now rehash to us all how he lied and how I am the downfall of the country for giving less of a screaming shit about a man lieing about sex than I do about foriegn policy, or the economy. You know the shit that matters at the end of the day. Please cendan try to use lotsa derogatory language and personal slams to it really helps get your point across during an argument. Heck it almost gets your point across as much as my statement earlier about Dems being easier to stomach because they don't seem so self-righteous.<br>
      I am quite aware you didn't mention Bush. Hell i wouldn't want to bring his name up if I were slamming someone else's personal life faux pas' either.  I brought his name up to prove that the right is just as unrighteous as the left if you would have read the last part of my post you would have perhaps gotten the whole picture, but alas you saw Clinton's name and no accusations after so you assumed i must have wanted to suck him off. Great assumption. I was trying to point out the hypocricies of your beliefs without directly calling you a hippocrite, because for all i know you may be so far into the republican propaganda machine that you think G. Gordon Liddy and Oliver North, two conservative radio hosts who have spent time for criminal acts, are the best source of truth.<br>
        The democrats are hippocrites too. There hippocracies just aren't as funny as to me as the republicans. <br>
         IE Al Gore tries to kiss ass of the recording industry to get musicians to up his vote with youth a decade or so after calling for there censorship....funnyscale 5 maybe 6<br>
          IE2  Papa Bush states that Bill Clinton's marijuana history should be brought up because character is important in a president, eight years later when asked about his sons alcoholism and cocaine use he says the media should stick to the issues......Funnyscale says time to change shorts. <br>
            Oh yeah lets reexamine Bill's weed history. Media asks, &quot;smoke dope billy?&quot; Billy say &quot;uh yeah didn't inhale&quot; Media &quot;so you did smoke dope?&quot; Billy &quot;yes next question please&quot; Just then the Right bursts through and starts ripping the man down with all kinds of derogatory statements. Wonder why he lied about the bj? That was Kytherion's point. No answer was an acceptable answer but the lie. <br>
             Oh and no matter how much I jerk off or on whose face we are not a joke to the world. Not now. Not after Bush has shit on the abm treaties we had with Russia and China. The most recent of many we have thrown out during his administration, but why deal with issues I think Bill may have corn holed a chick in college and never came out and confessed it to us. See if we can subpeona her. What's that you say Israel just cut off peace talks with Palestine....oh well, got any more dirt on Chandra Levy/Gary Condit...that is what is detrimental to society so says Cendan so it shall be. <br>
PS if i made a pint in there skip over it and just repeat the line Bill clinton lied repeat it over and over and eventually we will all give a damn and help you build the big giant cross.<br>

Maybe I am just a man with a problem, and seeing that problem don't want others to fall into it, or I just don't want alcohol to be so easy for me to get my hands on.

<br>
The examples you cite are great.  If they happened then you are right and Bush is a hypocrite, but still comes down to me never saying he wasn't.<br>

Bush doesn't represent me real well, no candidate in office ever will.  Lets not confuse the issues here.  I am not comparing presidents other than George and Bill.

To me a man stands on his own merits... not what his father did or did not do, and certainly not compared to other men.  Clinton wasn't as bas as so and so, so we should just accept the stupid things he did do??  That’s a pretty great way to do things huh?<br>
<br>
<br>
George Bush has his issues, most of which I am probably not aware because I usually don't delve to deep into politics, if it doesn't make the headlines I probably don't see it. The thing about George is that I think he is mostly sincere.  I am not talking about his foreign policies, or his tax cuts... I am saying that I think he means what he says and really wants what’s best for everyone.  Pause here and remember I don't think he's perfect.<br>
<br>
Bill, on the other hand, strikes me as an opportunist.  He always looks like he is hiding something.  He always seems like he is looking out for himself.  When he speaks you can almost see in his eyes that he is thinking something else.  I am a pretty good judge of people, always have been (pause here to remember I didn't say I am always right), and he just always rubbed me wrong.<br>
<br>
I won't support Bush just because he is Republican.  I won't rag on Clinton because he is Democrat.  Parties mean nothing to me... except a reference point that I as a conservative person will most likely agree with a republican on a matter that is important to me.  That is a generalization though as there are some democrats that are more conservative than some republicans.  I didn't vote for Bush in the elections, I voted against Gore by pressing the button for Bush.<br>
<br>
I am not really aware of the stereotypes of the two parties.  I forget - as a republican am I for gun control or against?  Am I for or against big programs that pay lazy people to sit home?  Feel free to fill me in on what my party stands for cause I only pick one so I can go vote on the person who I believe cares more about making change.  No, that isn't a speech or a personal attack on anyone, just my true naive stance on voting.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the Clinton thing.  My statement:  <font color=yellow>You either know enough about both of them to know why I say it or you are too stupid to reason with. Either way it is a waste of time to tell you. </font color>  Wasn't really the best way to state it.  My point is that if you think democrats are better then you obviously aren't based on facts so arguing with you is a waste.  Sure, its a generalization, but its an accurate one 9/10 times.<br>
<br>
As a conservative (NOT read Republican) I see most Liberals (NOT read democrat) as so afraid that their rights will be trampled on that they will let anyone speak for them.  Thats fine and great for them but I choose to look at character.<br>
<br>
As far as backing out of trade agreements or whatever, that is party line BS.  Some president goes in and manages to get stuff through using his party.. next one comes along.. so he has to go by what the other one did?  People do what they want to get done while president and hope it sticks when they leave (some do it for the country and some do it just to be remembered).<br>
<br>
You can take the stance that backing out gives our country the appearance of instability but it doesn't.  When a new boss comes into the company people expect change.  Its just how it is.  Some people will lose jobs, departments will be reorganized, some people will like the new boss, and some people will miss the old boss.  <br>
<br>
Stop saying Bill Clinton lied about sex.  What a cop out.  Makes it all sound so innocent... its just sex right and people in our country lie about sex all the time.  First off we shouldn't be so comfortable with people who lie about sex or anything for that matter.  Second of all we aren't talking about a lie.  We are talking about breaking the law.  You say I don't answer questions so answer these:<br>
<br>
Why did he take the stand knowing he had to lie?<br>
Why did he take the oath knowing he had to lie?<br>
Does the stance "they shouldn't have asked" always excuse perjury or just when its a member of your party?<br>
Can anyone say "thats none of your business so I am going to lie" or does that fall under presidential power?<br>
<br>
Let me over simplify.<br>
<br>
Did Clinton lie on the stand?<br>
Is it against the law to lie on the stand?<br>
What happens to people who lie on the stand?<br>

Blah.. blah... blah... blah, I dont care if the president lies, steals, kills, or anything else.  As long as my wallet is fat, my party is in control, and I don't have to sacrafice anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
You mean 'sacrifice'. Actually, that's pretty clearly not what I said. Since we're sinking to the level of insults and misquoting, I'll just call you a stupid, illiterate fuckwad who is upset that the American people won't approve his self-appointment as moral inquisitor to the presidency.<br>
<br>
I said capital crimes should be dealt with, and this includes murder, you halfwit. I said I don't give a damn about the economy, or about party lines. Read it again.<br>
<br>
Clue for you: before you assign yourself as a moral crusader in American politics...<br>
<br>
1. Learn to fucking read.<br>
2. Learn how American politics work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You ramble on and on but you overlook one thing.  Clinton swore to tell the truth ON THE STAND.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't overlook it, fanatic. I addressed it clearly. I said it wasn't a sufficient pretext for impeachment proceedings. My failure to agree with you does not indicate a failure to understand you. It just indicates that you're probably wrong. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Go jerk off to your slick willie poster.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could do that, but I'd rather just fuck your mom up the ass again, she squeals like a naughty little piggy. Your dad likes to have seconds, with his tongue. We done with the petty insults yet?<br>
  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why should anyone trust what clinton says he will do for them when he can't even avoid lying to the courts in his home country.&quot;<br>
<br>
AND WHEN WILL YOU GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK FUCKING SKULL THAT THE PRESIDENT'S JOB ISN'T TO CATER TO YOUR WHIMS?<br>
<br>
Trust? What he will do for you? <br>
<br>
HE'S THE CHIEF OF STATE, NOT YOUR FATHER, YOU INFANTILE PISSANT.<br>
<br>
He is the executive fucking branch of the government, and is absolutely correct to evade and resist growing Congressional oversight of his position. As long as Bible-thumping moralist shitheads such as yourself continue to approve Congressional witchhunts targetted at our chief of state, the chief of state will continue to do what is necessary to secure the office they are given.<br>
<br>
I realize, Cendan, that you are in favor of toppling our entire balance of power in order to pursue a minor legal point with a former president. I understand fully your insane desire to compromise the office of the president in order to enforce your personal code of morals. I'm perfectly aware of your willingness to inflict your emotional needs for security and control upon the Oval Office.<br>
<br>
You're not hard to understand, Cendan. You're just a zealot who can't figure out why people won't agree with him. <br>
<br>
Republican, Democrat, Whig, Independent, Libertarian...I don't care. I will never support the subjugation of one branch of government to another for reasons of moral difference or for anything less than a capital crime. Nor will I support extremists from either the Left or the Right in their attempts to compromise the balance of power upon which our government rests to serve their own special interests.<br>
<br>
This isn't Iran, and he isn't your dad. Grow up.<br>

<br>
So tell me Cendan, since you admit to not being &quot;aware&quot; of issues with Bush outside of &quot;the headlines&quot;, why do you think you know so much that you can flame others as being stupid if they disagree with you? Chances are (by your own addmission) that many are going to know much more about American politics than you if they just read the newspaper in depth. /shrugs <br>

<br>
Please re-read your words above. You harshly judge Bill Clinton as a political dog because &quot;He always looks...&quot;? Cendan, nobody but a bigot would think they could judge people based upon outer appearances. I suppose you think men who were pink shirts are homosexuals, too? I find it amusing when the ill informed resort to the &quot;he looks like a crook&quot; type of ignorance when judging a person's character. <br>
<br>
Fact is Cendan, you have no real idea what GW Bush is doing. He could be slapping his salami to a Monica Lewinski picture at this very moment and you wouldn't have a clue. Much worse than that he is probably actively fucking over another 3rd world Latin American country just as his father did. Do we know if he is? Yup, just need to read more than the fucking headlines of a newspaper!<br>

<br>
Does it really matter to you Cendan if a person lies under oath or lies at all? In other words, you seem to excuse the lies of other Politicians just so long as they don't do it under oath. <br>
<br>
One last thing Cendan, do you even know what President Clinton said under oath verbatim? Since you like to make snap judgements based on news headlines (or whether or not someone has calouses on their lips or wear pink shirts) I doubt you even read the Clinton deposition where it is said that he lied.<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer to reserve judgement about a person if I don't have the facts at hand. I realize it is easier to haul of and condemn people rather than take time to get the facts. Conservatives seem very trigger happy when it comes character assasination. However, taking time to research an issue prior to judging pays off in the long run. It usually prevents one from looking like a stupid idiot when the facts finally do come out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Prosecute!</span><hr size=1> Actually thank you. Thank you for elaborating and not having to delve into name calling as you started. I am truly sorry I had to do so. I was afraid that was all you understood and I am quite happy to admit I am wrong and there is honestly no sarcasm there. I truly appreciate well thought out arguments, i think by debating issues we can get down to the heart of matters but to often in this country especially so many people are so passionate about there beliefs they will outright reject a different opinion or facts that rock there dogmatic boat.<br>
<br>
Ok as for your alcohol example, it is perfect. Say you drink to much, should we try to regulate drinking. Isn't that unfair to responsible drinkers. What about porn? What about drugs? What about any of the numerous other vices America at large participates in. I am of the belief that if it is a victimless crime it isn't a crime. Who is harmed by prostitution? Who is harmed by cigarettes? (honestly now is second hand smoke gonna kill me quicker than the smoke stack in the factory across the street or the tap water i can see stuff floating in?)<br>
<br>
I am glad you said Bush didn't represent you, now read the last part of my first post. Yup didn't vote Clinton. As for Abraham Lincoln's secret harlots relating to pride of the nation.. not so much i am sorry to say. If you look at the documents all beliefs America is based upon you will see Thomas Jefferson's name. It has been proven by genetic testing that he fathered children with a slave. A woman he literally owned and could buy and sell. Yet still I think the points he made are very relevant today, despite his immoral ways. <br>
<br>
Clinton wasn't as bad as so and so is my reference to the things that made him a bad president having been done previously by members of the opposite party. I pointed them out to prove that a statement as blunt as Clinton is the worst is a tough sell. Should we accept the stuff he did? I dunno should we treat him worse than those who did it first or worse? And if Clinton was the straw that broke the back shouldn't we have his predecessor owning up to his actions.<br>
<br>
Ok i can see where you think you can trust him. He has reieved great media spin. I don't think the media is conservative or republican in general it is ratings. Bush is aw shucks good ol boy attitude is the same reason the media liked Clinton. Plus i think the media knew they were both bound to fuck things up somehow and make wonderful ratings grabbers. Come on Jimmy Carter couldn't make news he was just a mild mannered grinning fool. Kennedy and Nixon they made the newspeddlers millions. Seriously though I am glad you have an opinion but you and the world would be much better off if people did look deeper into there public figures public actions. Find out if they are doing what we pay them to. This why you elected them. We don't elect them to keep tabs on there private goings on. This is why I try to focus on policy of which i think Clinto did better than the three Republican terms before him. Policy. The reason he was in the office. Was Pete Rose a good baseball player. Yes. To say he was the worst because he was a gambler and liar is an unfair assessment of the job he did. Is Eddie Van Halen a good guitarist?  Yes. To say he was the worst guitarist because he was selfish and destructive to his own band is a crappy assessment of his guitar playing. <br>
George bush seems sincere to you but his squinty smirk creeps me out and his cowboy lingo scares me. Bill clintons easy grin and bulbous red nose reminded me of the guy who thinks it his duty to keep the party hopping at the company picnic. This is not how i form opinions of them though. Personally I wanted to beat him with a discount made GM part after NAFTA. However I am sure lest Pat Buchanon or Ralph Nader, two guys whose blatant honesty scare too many people to capture the mid-ground neccessary to run a campaign, were the prez it would have went through regardless of who sat behind the desk. I mean GW has backed out of our long standing agreements with the world on so many issues now this highly unpopular one would seem like chicken droppings compared to the Kyoto Accords, but still it stands and will. <br>
As for the statement "Am i for or against the big programs that pay lazy people to sit at home?" I think your wording says it all. Lets call it welfare. This figure was published in '97 but is probably still pretty close to accurate.<br>
           All social programs combined from aid to families with dependent children to school lunches to housing assistance amounts to fifty billion dollars. That breaks down to $415 a year per person. <br>
That same year...<br>
Corporations recieved nearly $170 billion in federal tax funded hand outs. That's $1388 a year per person. <br>
So if taking money from the downtrodden just to punish the few lazy shits (and yes there are some, but welfare has such a stigmata to it I knew a woman personally who wouldn't leave her abusive husband because she'd need public assistance to feed her baby) is more of a priority than stopping the bilking of the government by corporations and there multi-millionaire chairmen who hold jobs hostage for a piece of our tax money is a bigger priority, may i suggest reinstating trickle down economics and cutting social services. I am sure the decay of urban America and the rise of crack empires had nothing to do with fattened ceo's taking jobs outta inner cities to move them to areas with better tax breaks and tax payer funded private parking lots. That's another huge rant though and I won't go into that sorry i started I just really cringe when i here a conservative talk about welfare reform. Like i stated earlier more money is wasted in more unproductive areas of government then the one that actually does give something back.<br>
<br>
Ok I am assuming when you say democrats aren't better you aren't implying by default that republicans are better. If that is your stance I agree. I only said democrats were easier to stomach because the average democrat doesn't start an argument by implying your mentally unbalanced and accusing you of performing fellation on whomsoever you were defending.<br>
<br>
I said I thought most dems were to pussy. C'mon guys defend yourselves please. That's why whomsoever is brave enough to say what they believe often does speak for 'em. There are actually lots of intelligent liberals who will never be heard form because they know how the conservative branch of the media will call them out on past imperfections. There is a definite double standard there. Clinton's pot bad, GW's crack not an issue? <br>
<br>
Actually it wasn't a trade agreement bush backed out of it was a anti-ballisitic missile treaty. Signed to help end the cold war. It was designed to slow the massive global build up of armaments. Backing out of has sent ripples through China, Russia, and many other countries. These are agreements which eased hostilities he has said are irrelevent now. they've existed less time than they've been worked on. Arms agreements are less party issues than world issues. Yes America is the world leader but that doesn't mean we are the sole decision makers, like I said Germany thoght that way once too. No backing out doesn't make us look unstable it makes us look like we don't need to abide by the rules the rest of the world has agreed to play by, and on arms that is a major issue.<br>
<br>
     Saying Bill Clinton lied about sex makes it sound trivial. Yes. Yes it does. Saying we let some very self righteous minority (and only a minority approved of the trials) throwour country into the greatest turmoil since Nixon's boys broke into Democratic HQ, possibly since the trials of the first failed impeachment attempt so long ago because the president lied about getting oral sex makes it sound more than trivial. It sounds fucking ridiculous. Why? 'cause the republicans couldn't burn him with Whitewatergate, or Travel Gate, or China Gate, or whatever the Gate-of-the-Week was. But Monica Gate they finally had him sure they had to sink to the lowest levels. Sure it had nothing to do with that trollup Jennifer Followers accusations that he improperly touched her after she followed him up to his hotel room. (why is everything  gate you'd think the party that committed that crime wouldn't want it rehashed or are the trying to soften the destruction Nixon did to public trust by showing that crappy investing and philandering men are the true downfall of the country not that elections can be so easily tampered with. Jeez while I am thinking of it which candidate recieved a video tape of the other's practice debating and returned it unopened last election? <br>
<br>
Why did he take the stand knowing blah blah blah?   short answer even presidents can be subpeona'd (SP?)<br>
Why did he take oath knowing ....?  Even presidents can be treated as hostile witnesses. Actually i think he thought whose gonna give a flying ram's shit if i got a bj they couldn't have gone to all the trouble to ... oh wow these guys got a lotta free time. shit! I'm fucked. <br>
I think everyone has the right to lie to questions they feel pressed to answer but don't want to. <br>
Did Clinton lie on the stand? yup<br>
Is it against the law to lie on the stand? short answer yeah. Long answer no. There is precedence (and that is big in legallities) where charges of perjury have been dropped because the person didn't know (s)he was lieing,(oh Bill knew i won't argue that), where the question was misunderstood,( i doubt he misunderstood), and even when the person could prove he wasn't recieving a fair trial.( hmm that one coulda worked but man how much longer would the trial have drug out. thank you Bill for not choosing this route)<br>
What happens to people who lie on the stand? Well precedence says if you are a president nothing. Remember I mentioned Iran/Contra. He is president. The head of everything. Do you think CEOs recieve warnings or have ever been fired for "borrowing" company pencils? Have regular workers? CEOs' jobs are evaluated by the bottom line,<br>
that's how a president should be. Now if he had lied about something that had even the slightest affect on my life or your life than yeah hang him out but I still fail to see how his sexual misdeeds had any affect on peace or prosperity in America or the world. Well I am glad we could take this to a higher ground at least. Thank you again for elaborating and ending the persoanal assaults.<br>

<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Does anyone here feel that the way in which we conduct ourselves in our personal life is usually if not often the way we conduct ourselves in our professional life as well?<br>

<br>
1) No.<br>
2) Yes, but not until he was out of office.  Whatever the law requires and then let his lawyers work.  (I believe in most states this includes jail time, which I am sure in his case would have been community service).  I believe he should have been punished once out of office because if it had been the average person on the stand, they would have been called upon this and punished by the court of law.<br>
3) Yes.<br>
4) No.  I feel if the circumstances show a need for investigation it should be done, however witchhunts are not necessary.<br>
5) No.<br>
6) No.  A president should not lie while in office.  Period.  <br>
7) As a person, no.  I do not feel he was a person of good moral character, I do not feel he was a good Ambassador to the world.  However, I do agree with many things he did while in office, and I feel he did a good job in the actual running of the country.  I am sure someone could point out many failings and explain why its really someone else's fault or someone else deserves the credit, but /shrug.  From the knowledge I have of the situation, he was a pretty good Chief Exec.  It is embarrassing though to know that when he went to other countries, they knew all about his sex life.  I mean, don't you wonder how often he had to discuss that first in his dealings with other exec's?  &quot;yes, Mr. Chinese Leader, my wife and I are having some marital difficulties, I thank you for your marraige help book, entitled how to keep it in your pants when you've got lots of pressure on you.&quot;  I often wonder how much difficulty that caused.  I am sure though that the other leaders always asked themselves &quot;I wonder if he's lying to me?&quot;  Course they probably had to ask to that before too, since all politicians lie.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I do feel that the way in which a person conducts themselves in their personal life, is indeed, reflected in their professional life.  That is why, in my opinion, many people were so upset with Clinton and all the many scandals he had during his presidency.  We are not talking about Kennedy or anyone else, I am sure all Presidents have had scandals or potential scandals.  Most of us have in our lives as well.  We all know inside, I think, that if someone lies about little things at home to their Mom, Dad, Wife, or Dog, that they most likely will lie about at least the little things at work and school, etc.  And maybe the big things too.  After all, if lying is ok, or justifiable, then we can rationalize it away.  The line for where it truly becomes wrong is always below where we are standing.  <br>
<br>
So, now that the truth was out - OMG Clinton LIED! -  and we could no longer pretend to ourselves that our President wasn't actually this great super human being who was perfect.  Damnit!  We were so disappointed to discover he's actually a human, just like you and me!  Wow.  /sarcam off<br>
<br>
Really, I think he should not have lied.  Of course, I think he should not have cheated on his wife.  <br>
<br>
I think we SHOULD have a moral person in office, one of good moral character.  I don't think wanting that, or demanding he be punished for breaking the law is a bad thing, as seems to be the trend.  I think he should have been given the same damn sentence I would have gotten ahd I lied on the stand.<br>
<br>
Yes, I feel people were out to get Clinton, but that doesn't excuse his behavior nor does it justify his lying.  Whether you steal a loaf of bread because you feel like it, or because you are hungry, you are still a thief.  One might be justified, but you'd probably still get some type of punishment because the law had been broken.  In Clinton's case, the lying was not justified.  His behavior, even though in his personal life, was inexcusable.  Face it folks, he screwed up.  He did.  Admit it.  He broke the law.  Why he was hunted down, why his trial happened, why he was almost forced out of office, it all becomes moot when you consider that he was guilty.  Do I feel the punishment exceeded the crime (or the almsot punishment of impeachment)?  Yes.  Lying is wrong, but in his case, was not impeachable in my opinion. <br>
<br>
Only one quote I want to include here:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  As long as Bible-thumping moralist shitheads such as yourself continue to approve Congressional witchhunts targetted at our chief of state, the chief of state will continue to do what is necessary to secure the office they are given.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I know lots of people who believe Clinton was morally wrong, and they are not Church goers or bible thumpers as stated here.  Whether they approved the so called witch hunt or not, I dont know, but lets not generalize too much here.  <br>
<br>
Also, having a Chief of State who does whatever is necessary in order to keep his office is NOT a good trend IF you are stating the following.  If you mean - the president should use any means necessary in order to avoid scrunity and accountability in his life while he is in power - I do not agree with you at all.  <br>
<br>
Lets use an analogy.  Would you want someone teaching your child who was an admitted child molester?  How about a child abuser?  How about a teacher who has contributed to the deliquency of a minor?  How about a teacher who has lied for example, on the stand, about a personal issue in their sex life, perhaps whether they had sex with an 18 year old student right after graduation?  I hope your answer would be no, you really wouldn't want this kind of person teaching your child if you had a choice.  Why?  They have had an admitted moral charachter flaw and you wouldn't want them teaching your kid in case your child learned something you didn't want them too - you don't want that variable in their life.<br>
<br>
How about this?  Would you want a CEO in your company who was a known embezzler?  One who was accused of embezzling?  one who lied ont eh stand during an embezzling case?  Might you not be a bit concerned about that and how it might affect the company,  and hence your job at the very least?<br>
<br>
How much more then, does the President represent.  How much more does his character, personally, and that of the office in general, affect his leadership of our country?<br>
<br>
It does affect it.  how much I am not sure.<br>
<br>
Now, please answer the above questions.  Not sure who's quote that was, I copied it and hit a general reply.  Notice that I am not defending anyone here, not flaming anyone, and not really supporting anyone.  Just gave my own opinion on the matter.  Now, I'd love to read yours clearly stated and please include reasons why you chose what you did.  <br>

<br>
3) Yes. Peanut butter licking episodes or the like are private affairs and I could care fucking less what Bill did privately.<br>

Yes. I would have.<br>
<br>
<br>
2)  Do you feel that Clinton should have been punished for the actual perjury?  If so, what punishment would have been appropriate and why?<br>
<br>
Not until he was out of office. <br>
<br>
<br>
3)  Do you feel the trial should have waited till he was out of office due to the nature of it?  (Personal)<br>
<br>
See number 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
4)  Do you feel we (as the people and including our congressmen whom we elect to represent us) should never investigate the personal life of the President while he is in office?<br>
<br>
Unless there is compelling evidence for a formal investigation of a capital crime, I feel as though exposing the lives of our leaders is a job for the free press, not Congress. So unless a Secret Service person comes forward with evidence of a pile of bodies, leave it to the tabloids. When Congress begins behaving like the staff of the National Enquirer, it's up to the people to reign them in.<br>
<br>
<br>
5)  Do you feel that it is appropriate for a sitting President to lie, even if he may not get caught in it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Appropriate&quot;? That's a bit half-assed, don't you think?<br>
<br>
I feel it is NECESSARY for the president to lie in the course of his job. I don't have to LIKE it. I'm not sure that appropriateness comes into it at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
6)  Do you feel it is appropriate for a sitting President to lie only about personal issues?<br>
<br>
See number 4. Particularly, if personal issues are being used by political enemies to undermine the authority of the presidency, the president should defend the office by any means necessary, including telling big fat lies.<br>
<br>
<br>
7)  As the president is our Chief Executive officer and is our Ambassador to the World, do you feel that a known liar, such as Clinton, was a good choice (in retrospect)?  Please answer based on his own merits, not in comparisons.<br>
<br>
Any judgement on this would be entirely premature. As the &quot;Ambassador to the World&quot;, he was fairly well-liked, and had a number of successes, mostly in dealing with our closest allies. Since we can only really determine such things by comparison, I'll disregard your instruction and point out that Nixon, despite personal failings, served this country admirably as a diplomat to the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Does anyone here feel that the way in which we conduct ourselves in our personal life is usually if not often the way we conduct ourselves in our professional life as well?<br>
<br>
No, because I know history. I know that Julius Caesar was notorious for sleeping with anything that moved and for running up debts with half of Rome. His troops called him &quot;the Whoremaster&quot;. I know that Winston Churchill was an obese alcoholic who was famous for bragging and happily admitted to lying whenever it suited his purposes. His memoirs are chock full of absolute revisionist horseshit.<br>
<br>
I also know that these men rank as two of the finest leaders that Western civilization has ever produced.<br>
<br>
Hitler, on the other hand, was a quiet, pleasant sort who never drank, smoked or ate red meat. If he hadn't been trying to stuff millions of people into gas chambers, he'd have fit right in at the local Baptist church.<br>
<br>
If history supported the conclusion that one's personal habits and conduct indicated one's professional capabilities, it would be an easy task to choose the good from the bad, and the rulers from the subjects.<br>
<br>
But history in no way supports such a conclusion. The world is an ambiguous place, and attempting to impose black and white rules on complex issues leads to a great deal of disappointment.<br>

<br>
1)	No, lying on the stand is a crime.  We are protected by 5th amendment rights to avoid having to do that.  Clinton got up there and took an oath.  He can answer questions, refuse to answer questions, but lying is not an option.<br>
2)	Yes he should have been punished, the punishment should fit the crime.  He should receive no harder or easier judgment.<br>
3)	I think the trial could have waited.. since most trials are not immediate anyway.  Problem is that he made this nation look bad and removing him (through trial) would have been better.<br>
4)	I don’t think we should know what is going on in the personal life of the president but I also think that events in the oval office are not personal.  It’s a mistake (although a long standing one) to have the office of the president be the home of the president also because it tends to blur the lines.  I worked with my wife for a while and I tried to keep personal stuff at home, and business stuff at the office.<br>
<br>
Although this wasn’t part of the question, I want to point out in the context of what happened… they shouldn’t have asked.. but they did.  He could have said “I plead the 5th because that’s a personal question.”<br>
5)	A lie is a lie… a lie is never not a lie.  To lie is a bad thing.. we aren’t talking morals here we are talking common sense.  To want no one to lie is idealistic, but I think we can all see the benefit in a society where things can be taken at face value.  Its up to you to decide if you are a person who is going to tell the truth in spite of dealing with people who lie to you, or if you are going to be a person who lies because everyone else does.  SO… it is inappropriate for a president to lie, despite the fact that people assume he is going to be lying, God forbid the president becomes an office worthy of respect.<br>
6)	To lie about a personal issue is a cop out.  See above about lying.  You have the right to refuse to answer personal questions.<br>
7)	No Clinton was not a good choice but to be fair, neither were the people he ran against.  <br>
<br>
I don’t understand how people can hold to the opinion that his personal life is his.  That’s like saying an employer can’t ask you if you have ever been convicted of a crime when they hire you.  That’s personal right?  No.  They need to know that because integrity is a part of the job.<br>
<br>
The president is more so because not only is he going to be put in a position where trustworthiness is needed, but he is going to be put in a position where people are going to see if he is not a man of integrity.<br>
