<br>
I'm sorry you didn't stick it out in college, but that's okay.<br>
Now that you've decided to take the next step, I can help you further if you'd like.<br>
<br>
I have a good friend who just transferred from sea duty to recruiting duty in Garland, Tx.  He also plays EQ on E. Marr!<br>
<br>
Maybe you two could get together and chat IG about the Navy.  Look at your other options (Air Force, Army, Coast Guard) as well.  I'll talk to him IG or give him a call before I reveal his IG identity.  More Free advice, and he shouldn't give you any BS.<br>
<br>
I mentioned Security as a hot field.  In the Navy, this rating is called Master At Arms, or MAA.  In the first few years, it WILL involve standing some very boring security watches.  It might also have some real excitement.  It can lead to a civilian career in Law Enforcement, as someone mentioned.  If your interests don't lie that way, I'd steer clear.<br>
<br>
Look for an Enlistment Bonus as well, regardless of which branch or field you pick.  This could mean a nice check in your pocket and isn't something the recruiters always offer.  I've seen them give as little as a few hundred bucks to over $10,000!  Now is actually a good time to come in for a higher bonus.  (Worst time is right after high school graduation)<br>
(That's separate from a Re-enlistment bonus which may be offered a few years later.  I received almost $30K in Selective Reenlistment Bonus to re-up for 5 years last time I resigned.)<br>
<br>
Make sure you sign up for the Montgomery GI bill once you join.  It is the best spent $1200 investment you can make.  If you GO Navy, get the Navy  College Fund also.  The latter should be automatic, but it wasn't offered to me.  But I'm old.<br>
<br>
Take a close look at the National Guard or the Reserves as well.  It may be the break from college you are looking for and give you the jolt you need to find direction in your life.<br>
<br>
One more thing.  Prepare yourself for NO Everquest for a few months at least, possibly longer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
First, I'd have to agree that the AF is the best route to go if you're looking for the most decent quality of life.  And whether or not you have a significant other atm, chances are, it may happen while you're enlisted, so it's something to think about.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the advice people have commonly given here (think twice and three times about it, and then think about it some more!) is great advice.  When my husband enlisted, I had no clue about what lie ahead.  We were married 2 days before we hopped in the car and made the 1200 mile trip to our new home.  I'd say the first year sucked horribly, and the secpnd two years only slightly less so.  I always thought that the being treated like the scum of the earth ended after basic - *laugh*  <br>
<br>
Long story short - We had one disataster after another, and we were soooooo poor!  (I think I once calculated out that my husband averaged $2.36 per hour)  I think the statistic is something like 40% of our nation's military families qualify for food stamps.  What's that you say?  Oh, the FREE HEALTHCARE!  *cough*  Have a headache?  *hands you motrin*  Broken leg?  *hands you motrin*  Heart failure?  *hands you motrin*  LOL, you get the idea.  It is pretty substandard care.<br>
<br>
BUT, the military can and will change the person that you are, forever.  It will make you stronger.  It's amazing that even as a military wife, I've changed.  I guess one thing we always kept saying is, &quot;if we make it thru this, we'll be together forever.&quot;  And looking back on it now 3 years later, there are pleanty of things I miss, even though at the time I bitched about it almost constantly.  It's made me stronger and more independant, and I wouldn't trade the experience for anything - not that I want to go thru it again! LOL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So that's my bittersweet memories of the military - hope that makes sense.<br>
<br>
good luck to you! <p>Hestia Oakmist<br>Mix Master Extraordinaire<br>

I spent 8 years in the army and I had alot of fun but there are times that you will get upset. As for the Army Warrent officer program GL with that. You must fill out a packet, write autobiography and all other kinds of hoops to jump thru. In my opinion you need to have a degree or know someone but its worth a try. <br>
<br>
Now on to the criminal record. When they do a background check it will show that something was exsponged from your record but will give no details. Stick with a flat out no on this and never change your awnser it cant be found.<br>
<br>
Have fun in whatever you do but make sure what you chose to do is transferable to civilian life and you get it in writing. Dont ever forget you can always say NO to anything they offer until you sign the dotted line, Then you become property. Belive it or not they charge you with a Article 15 for injurying yourself ( Destrution of goverment property). It doesnt happen alot but it can happen, kinda funny in my eyes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umarranecro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marra Necro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/29/02 10:02:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrreallife.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Military accession indecision...</span><hr size=1> Shadowed you  goof I was IN the 1/17 INf batt.

If there are only 3 billets open only 3 people are going to advance. And then it is the best test scores and evals that fight for them.<br>
<br>
There are some rates that almost everyone who takes them advances, but then there are some that only 2% of the people taking the test make it.<br>
<br>
I came into the Navy as an E-3, made E-4 4 months later and then took my first E-5 exam 3 months later. This is not common, but it can happen. However the possiblity of making E-5 was slim to none and so I took the test a few times. The reason for not making E-5 right away was that if I had re-enlisted for 2 more years I would have made a nice bonus 40kish, and E-5 automatically. Well you can imagine how many people DID re-enlist, so that cut the avalible billets way down for those of us who didn't re-enlist. (Just so no one jumps on this. I was a nuclear EM and I didnt like the job, so I didn't want to spend 2 more years doing it)<br>
<br>
Last I heard the Signing bouns for Nukes was up to 15k. With the star program getting as high a 45k for another 2 years and auto rank to E-5. (Remeber your bonus is taxed at 32%) You however don't get the bonus unless you pass your school. Which is almost 2years long in CHarleston, SC. So that is a 2 year wait on the 15k, it is taxed all to hell and if you don't pass you don't get it. Also the 45k star bonus is divided up in that when you sign you get half of it and then the rest is spread out over the course of your enlistment. So if you hvae 6 years left on your term, you will recieve 1/6th of it every October. And again it is taxed at 32%.<br>
<br>
This is the same for all signing bonuses. You only get them if you finish the school or term you agreed to. I don't know about other schools, but NUKE school was very hard and I saw a lot of friends get kicked out, or decide they didn't want to be there and got themself kicked out. Also my captian was a hard ass and if you went to Captians Mast you were lucky to keep the program.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking of going NUKE in the Navy feel free to drop me a line. I can also point you to about 15 other NUKE's on E-Marr in the 3 different ratings.<br>
<br>
As far as the GI Bill. You will be a fool not to take it. You only pay $100 a month for a year and when you get out you have enough to get a BA in almost any feild. If you are going to be a doctor or lawyer you won't, but you know how that goes. I am not sure you can get a signing bonus and the College fund, I am pretty sure it is an either or. ASK! That is the biggest thing, if you don't know or aren't sure ask.<br>
<br>
