<br>
Are you suffering from brain asphyxia? Last time I checked, sending troops into combat implied that you were fighting a war. Unless I've fundamentally misread over two thousand years of military history, America did fight the damn war.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Civilian lives do not count as enemy troops. Get your figures straight. 99% of the hype is American hype. Shut the fuck up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good, I'm...um...not sure what the fuck you're referring to, actually. What are you saying?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;England did not fall, only an amateur would claim it would if not for Americans. &quot;<br>
<br>
Really. So I suppose the British would have engaged the Kriegsmarine with wooden frigates had our destroyers not arrived. Or perhaps they could have made fighter planes out paper and used those.<br>
<br>
And these wooden ships and paper planes would, of course, be fueled with British oil from British oil fields. Except that those fields don't actually exist.<br>
<br>
Only an amateur believes that armies are supplied by magic, and only an amateur believes that armies win battles on the basis of courage alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;American forces lent military strength to the allied assault, that is all. There was no war destruction on US soil with the exception of one military attack on Pearl Harbor. It did not involve the great loss of life of American civilians from starvation and exposure. When you fight a war on your own dirt, your family can die.&quot;<br>
<br>
You might be building up to some kind of conclusion here, but since you didn't include it, the paragraph is kind of pointless. More to the point, I'm not even sure the individual sentences in that paragraph have anything to do with one another. <br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure why I'm taking issue with you at all, since you appear to be absolutely clueless with regard to what we're discussing. And even if you did have something to contribute, your dedication to butchering commonly accepted standards of grammar would obscure it beyond all hope of recovery.<br>
<br>
Actually, I won't take issue with you, I'll go out instead. Nevermind.<br>

<br>
The holocaust war occurred in Europe. <br>
<br>
Fighting the war was not just military service, it was also a fact in Europe for everybody else living there in that time that everyone struggled to remain apart from famines, exposure, enemy action, minefields, daily bombardment and shelling. <br>
<br>
Personal engagement with enemy ranged from simple lack of necessary things: like shoes, blankets, or clothing, or washing, or meat and potatoes, or wood/coal fuel; up to martial law, curfews, travelling with lack of identification, or being stuck choosing between evils and certain death. <br>
<br>
If all Americans lived through that level of engagement in Europe then history would regard America as having &quot;lived through the war&quot;. The U.S. sent troops to Europe which meant landing inside Europe, not America, as combined allies to conclude the war: to the countries visited by the war.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Last time I checked, sending troops into combat implied you were fighting a war.&quot; - Kytherion<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Incorrect, America did not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> literally</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> visit <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> itself</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> within an all consuming war between friend and foe. Troops sent to Europe were 'fighting IN a war', certainly but only those Americans visited war. At the personal level YOU (ordinary WW2 America) were still at home, across the Atlantic, there was no military action fought upon America and civilian order remained pretty stable. (Aside from Pearl Harbor, a Japanese attack)<br>
<br>
Newsflash, I'm not British nor European nor American. Your irrelevance is astonishing. I find the implied nationality a dumb conclusion since I never offered that inference.<br>
<br>
As for my opinion, I still believe America did military service but bear in mind I do not believe you entirely suffered the true cost met by Europe for that war. Boasts will not alter a perception of that view with raucous hype. <br>
<br>
I choose to regard that war with horror not envy. <br>

<br>
If the Germans would of invented the Jet engine on schedule they would of eliminated both my country and prolly most of europe then with the resulting land mass they owned laid waste to the US.<br>
<br>
The German army was formidable and it wasnt only the US army that saved us, so dont go blowing your &quot;We owe you big time trumpet&quot; you idiot.  England held out cos we are an island which is very difficult to attack.  Russia held out cos they are huge and have a harsh winter.<br>
<br>
Prehaps you should take a more objective opinion and reliase how close Germany (and Europe) were to the Atom bomb, Openheimer wasnt so far advanced as you may think. <br>

One of the quotes in the conclusions is<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
There are many other factors that explain victory and defeat beside von Ribbentrop's trio. Yet without Soviet resistance and reform, American rearmament and economic mobilisation, and western air power, the ability of the three major allies to wear down German and Japanese resistance would have been highly questionable. This still leaves open the question of German miscalculation. There were weaknesses and strengths in Hitler's strategy, but no misjudgements were more costly in the end than the German belief that the Red Army was a primitive force, incapable of prolonged resistance, or Hitler's insistence that the USA would take years to rearm and could never field an effective army, or the failure to recognise that bombing was a threat worth taking seriously before it was too late. Military arrogance and political hubris put Germany on the path to a war she could have won only if these expectations had proved true.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The overall site is very good.  It talks about different aspects of the war.  Like Pearl Harbor was a big screw up for the US since the intelligence was there, but not taken seriously.  Also, Japan was trying to knock us out of the war long enough to expand, which they did.<br>
<br>
With reguards to the German research into the atomic bomb, they were not close.  Heisenburg started out with a simple 1D calculation and came up with a result that implied you would need tons of plutonium or uranium.  (I don't recall the exact calculation.)  So he didn't think it would realiztically work.  There is unconfirmed reports that he sabatogued the effort, but it is not clear whether he did or didn't.<br>
<br>
From what I have gathered, the US was an important part of the war.  We supplied the allied countries with resources that were badly needed.  But overall it was a team effort.  It is like arguing whether the quarterback or a blocker is more important in American football.  All the Allied countries put forth a huge effort and all derserve the same recognition for their parts.<br>

We were the so called &quot;Arsenal of Freedom.&quot; Our simple ability to mass produce large quantities of equipment, ordinance, etc. and get it where it was needed and to WHO needed it was our largest contribution to winning WWII and the defeat of both Germany and Japan. This is not to diminsh the American troops efforts on land, sea and air, we did have our impact there particularly on the seaside of things. Fielding a large and succesful navy in two large oceans helped the allied cause tremendously but, lets face it despite the good personel we had on the ground our equipment was substandard to Geramany and England's mechanized capabilities, we just had hella more of it and the personal to use it all. prior to our formal entry into WWII we supplied both England and the USSR with material to fight the war, we &quot;sent&quot; volunteers to England and China to assist in the war effort and by the way to get expirence for our own personal for when we did eventually enter the war.<br>
<br>
 <br>
I mean this as no disrepect to any of the fighting men who engaged in ground, sea, or air but it is America's logistical support that had our greatest impact on the war effort. We were capable of producing and moving massive amounts of men and materail to any given point on the globe and having what you need where you need it, is half the battle.  <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
