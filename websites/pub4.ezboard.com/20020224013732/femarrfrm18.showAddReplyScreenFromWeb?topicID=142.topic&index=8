<br>
I do not know who is to blame for this. I don't point the finger at anyone for the actual bombing however the several thousand palestinians who were celebrating on the west bank should have been sprayed with gunfire in my opinion. They are all revering the loss of innocent human life. There are others that are going to fit into this category but so far thats all I've seen.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I won't accept any excuse that this is biased media. Industrial Light and Magic have not been creating CGI of palestinians dancing in the streets. These are guilty people every one of them. Maybe I'd be found as guilty as they for revering the loss of their life but at least they're not innocent. The same way I can accept capital punishment I guess.<br>
<br>
AS FOR THE GUILTY PARTY. <br>
<br>
There is a very slim chance that this is the act of any country. The wrath that this would bring down on Iraq, Iran, Libya and others is quite simply too great to chance. <br>
<br>
So that leaves a small faction. The fact that Iraq has so much to lose is the reason why the chances are so low it is them. Quite simply if this was linked to Iraq in any way, by government or by a faction of rebels American troops will obliterate every single military installation they have, every oil refinery, every trade centre, every rail station, airport. There would be nothing left. <br>
<br>
Libya, same deal. America would raze it to the ground and not one person would be able to do anything to stop that. Quite frankly the British and most of Europe would support the action.<br>
<br>
Currently our thoughts are with America but the UK is on red alert also, planes being grounded, the LSE being evacuated and closed. We are scared this could have happened to us and we do want retribution for this if only so we can sleep at night.<br>
<br>
Arafat is &quot;in shock&quot;  I believe that. The fact that he knew of this is too big to even comprehend. Surely he must know that every government around the world is going to lend all the money and troops needed to wipe this threat out and if it was connected back to him his future is limited. To hours.<br>
<br>
The biggest suspect at the moment is Osama Bin Laden, millionaire palestinian dissident currently in hiding with the Taliban. Bin Laden has made several statements that he was planning to cause &quot;disturbances to American interests&quot; Currently under warrant from the federal US government, wanted for the bombings of many American embassies. Although the Taliban have disavowed that he had anything to do with it, so has everyone else.<br>
<br>
What it boils down to is that NOBODY can admit to this one. It's just TOO horrific. Over the past 2 months we've argued about suicide bombings but the death toll on this one isn't going to be 30 people in a restaurant. Its possibly going to be 30,000.<br>
<br>
You kill 30 people and nobody is going to risk hundreds of lives. You kill 30,000 and it's never ever going to be forgotten, and we will stop at nothing.<br>
<br>
But despite the fact that nobody can admit this it's not going to take a genius to work this out. Passenger lists will have names and the terrorists will be on those passenger lists. Although passport details wont have been taken ( domestic flights don't require them ) people will have noticed suspect characters in airports, news will prevail.<br>
<br>
As for this being related to the conference on slavery you're off base on that one. First of all your assuming it's even related to Palestine and secondly it's just not a big enough event to spark this kind of destruction. This is going to have a massive cause we're not aware of OR its going to have no igniter at all.<br>
<br>
This took massive planning and a lot of backing, so although it is unlikely to have been initiated by a country it MAY have the backing of one. Certain people will have had instructions to go about their lives but one day they get a call and the plan springs into action. It could have been planned for years and only put into operation in seconds. Even the terrorists themselves may not have known yesterday morning that today they would be killing thousands of people.<br>
<br>
Although I agree with the statement. There will be a lot of racism displayed to palestinians along with iraqi's and generally anyones face that doesn't fit in. It's sad and it's true. <p><HTML><CENTER>
