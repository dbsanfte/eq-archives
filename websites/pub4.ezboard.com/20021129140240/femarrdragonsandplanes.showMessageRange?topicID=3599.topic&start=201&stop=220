  To recap Elnots, before you go on further tangent, what some people were trying to imply was that, when you say &quot;I believe in what is written in THE BIBLE&quot; no one actually knows what exactly you believe, including you. Arnwolf question about wether you read ancient arameic was not a jest... Most, if not all, texts will be distorted when translated in another language. some concept don't exist, some others are more detailed and will force you to pick some bagage that didn't exist in the original and so on... When you are talking about a text which went through translations of translations like in your case, reading it in the original language it was written in is the only way to be sure that you are actually reading what was written...<br>
<br>
Most of the people are not really annoyed at you for not liking homosexuality, bisexuality and/or other 'sexual' life-choice. What would really be nice though is that someone, who profess to follow to the letter a book which preach tolerance, would show some of that tolerance toward others. <br>
<br>
And remember, the bible is NOT and never was the word of God... It is the word of God, as translated by men who, apostle and prophets that they were, were still men and, as such, imperfect and failible. If someone, either those who wrote the original texts or those who came after and translated them, had any private agenda or just misread/misquoted/misconstrued something, you would/will end up accepting this misconstruction as biblical truth... That would give anyone a good reason not to believe 100% of all that is written in the bible, even someone who sees himself as a 'pure' christian.<br>

Kylien... You cannot avoid people suffer as soon as you talk about relationship. What you can avoid, or at least mitigate, is the amount of suffering you voluntarily make someone(s) endure in order to gain some personal satisfaction. And it's not all related to sex either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And do not confuse sex, love and marriage. Those are 3 entirely different things, even if each can lead to the others.<br>
<br>
- Sex is a physical activity, ( usually <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) shared with at least someone. It is an intimate activity but it is NOT the only one that would infer some large degree of intimacy (some deep discussion, psychanalisys treatments both come to mind).<br>
<br>
- Love is an emotional state, which does NOT rely on sex. You can love without having sexual intercourse. It so happen though than when people 'fall in love' one of the many things they intend to share in their future life is sexual intimacy. It is certainly not the only thing you want to share, not even the most important one.<br>
<br>
- Marriage is either a social institution or a religious ritual. In both cases, its purpose is to tell others that you intend to share your life with someone else. <br>
<br>
You can have sex without love or marriage<br>
You can love someone without bedding or marrying him/her<br>
You can marry someone for reasons which have nothing to do with either love or sex (doesn't mean they are not present.. means that they are not WHY you decided to marry that particular someone).<br>
<br>
Confusing Sex with Love or Love with Marriage only serve to narrow your life and feelings. <br>

<br>
You who are spouting christian views and such...<br>
<br>
Lets not forget the following points:<br>
<br>
1.  Do not presume to stand in place of God for he is the final judge of what is right and wrong.  You *will* be held to the same measuring stick you hold to others.<br>
<br>
2.  (Paraphrasing) Jesus pretty much made it plain that when the day comes for everyone to stand and be judged - that you would be shocked and surprised at who is turned away and who is let in - because you do not know the hearts of people and thus can not make a determination as to what on earth will get someone into heaven and what will not.<br>
<br>
Think before you speak - you who profess to be such a devout person - I surely hope you honestly follow your religion with such devotion that you are not a hypocrite.<br>

<br>
So why are people still telling us we shouldn't?<br>
<br>
Or are people still trying to impose thier values on other people in an effort to improve their self worth because deep down they are afraid they might, themselves, be wrong?<br>
<br>
Live your own life by your own values.<br>
<br>
Feel free to teach your values to your children as you see fit.<br>
<br>
We are not your children. You can share your opinion, but do not judge ours and do not impose your values on our lives.<br>
<br>
My personal belief system puts no weight to the words in the bible or an other work written by man. Show me the original 10 commandments written by the hand of god and I will obey those. But no one knows what the original 10 commandments were or even if there were 10. From the moment they were put onto paper (papyrus, sheepskin, whatever) they suffered from translation.<br>
<br>
The argument that love is the basis on which any sexual encounter should be based is so idealized and romaticized. It certainly is not a religious belief. Every western religion identifies women as possessions, and you cannot share love with a possession.<br>
<br>
Love as a requirement for marriage is a concept that until the last century, existed only in poetry.<br>
<br>
Equating sex to love as the defacto way of things is a more recent development than human flight.<br>
<br>
Your belief may be that you should love one person and have sex with only that person and only in marriage is your belief and is respectable in its own. Your need to impose those values or judge others by them is not respectable.<br>
<br>
I believe in monogamy if that is the choice you and your partner make. I believe in open relationships if that is the choice you and your partner make.<br>
<br>
But, everyone judges others by how close to themselves they are in their values. It takes a relatively enlightened mind to look beyond this and to truly accept others without feeling the need to change them. I am not that enlightened, I have a bothersome need to pry open the minds of people.<br>

By labeling people as either &quot;closed-minded&quot; or &quot;open-minded&quot; you are, in essence, being closed-minded yourself.  Your mind is not open to all of the ideas of the other individual.  Welcome to the machine, you're a cog!<br>
<br>
I'm not closed minded.  I'm not a fundamentalist.  Hell, I'm an 18 year old male college student.  I'm one hell of a good lookin' guy and I've had my fair share of relationships in my time.  I'm not trying to preach, and I'm not trying to force my views on anyone....<br>
<br>
But what a lot of people on this thread are doing is degrading sex, and more, degrading human beings to merely instinctive, animalistic, and selfish creatures whos only goal in their existance is to squeeze as much pleasure out of it as possible.  It doesn't have to be like that.  We are more than that.<br>

Only 2 creatures on the earth have sex purely for pleasure.<br>

It is obvious that sex purely for pleasure is a measure of a species advancement. Humans, with their ability to have sex for pleasure, are more advanced.<br>
<br>
Incidently the only other creature on the planet to have sex for pleasure is the dolphin.<br>
<br>
For every other species on earth, sex is a purely hormonal reaction.<br>

<br>
There is no perfect religion, marriage, or relationship.  To JUDGE a relationship that is hurting now one but the ppl in the relationship ( if it is hurting anyone at all) means that you have put yourself right up there with God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost.  If all members of the relationship are aware of what is going on and dont have a problem with it then who the @#%$ are you to tell them they cant do whatever it is they are doing.  What goes on in anyones house but your own is none of your biz PERIOD (well unless someone from your household is in the other house) <br>
<br>
To me all the close minded ppl remind me of little old ladies who gossip about what is going on because they have no LIFE to deal with.  Personally I have 3 kids and a husband that needs my attention so I could care less if Joe is sleeping with Bobby and Sarah is sleeping with Kathy.  Cause it isnt my Business. <br>
<br>
If you believe that those ppl are going to hell because of who they LOVE then the god you believe in is differant than the one I do.  Because the one I believe in tells me to love and not hate.<br>
<br>
Those who know who I am know my sexual preferances, those that dont well it isnt your biz either<br>
<br>
Oh btw Mormons didnt change the bible we just added on a book.  <br>
<br>
If you feel the need to get riled up over spelling and periods well go for it!  <br>

OK, I'll write it here for posterity.<br>
<br>
Religion is a codified system of excuses allowing people to sidestep responsibility, loyalty and ethicality, while propping up courage, tenacity and faith.<br>
<br>
It's amazing how the power of suggestion affects our anile minds. Everything from Aboriginal kurdaitchas pointing the bone to The Rev. Good Ole Boy Jehosophat with his healin' power.<br>
<br>
Marriage does not require &quot;holy sanction&quot; to work. It does not require third party homilies or exhortations. What is does require is two people willing to commit to each other. If they can't do that and want to play the field, then (once again) why get married?<br>
<br>

If the ability to have sex for pleasure makes humans more advanced, than the argument that casual sex is alright because we are merely animals is null and void. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/kyliensigz.jpg"></CENTER>

Marriage has many and varied meanings.  In this day and age, marriage is primarily a legal arrangement.  Anyone who refers to the &quot;holy sanctity&quot; of marriage is merely adding a personal layer to a purely social and legal arrangement.  If you have a &quot;Christian&quot; wedding, more power to you.  I hope the sun is shining for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Same of those who have a Muslim, Jewish, Wiccan, etc wedding.<br>
<br>
Question:- In days gone by, it was perfectly acceptable for men to have more than one wife at a time.  In the dictates of the belief systems in place at that time, were they wrong?  The answer is, of course, no.<br>

<br>
Animals have sex to breed because they smell females in season.<br>
<br>
Enlightened species, ok so there are more than 2, have sex because they realize that the result will make them feel good.<br>
<br>
Unlike humans, the other enlightened species don't have those who try to make them feel guilty for causing no one harm.<br>
<br>
Historically religion was used to teach us how to live healthier lives. There were rules on how to eat, how to prepare food etc... because at the time, it kept people from doing things that were unhealthy.<br>
<br>
The rules on kosher foods are there because kosher preparations were the best ways they had to prevent food from bacterial contamination.<br>
<br>
All the rules on monogamy were there because STDs were there and there were no cures no preventions outside of abstinance and monogamy.<br>
<br>
We dont live in the world the rules were made for. We live in a world where 99% of STDs can be cured and we know how to prevent their spread. <br>
<br>
We also live in a world where we know how to cook pork and how to butcher animals in ways that dont leave them flopping around in the gutters of the street.<br>
<br>
Most religious teachings are rules of healthy life for the ignorant. I am not ignorant. God has blessed me with the understanding and education to know how to live a healthy life.<br>
<br>
But then again maybe I am wrong. Maybe some really ugly monk who girls wouldnt even look at made all the rules while translating one day our of spite and jealousy. That it, no one will sleep with me so I am going to make sex a sin.<br>
<br>
You know it wasn't sex or carnality that got adam and eve ejected, it was shame. Perhaps it is those of us who are beyond being ashamed of our selves, our bodies and our desires that are truly finding a bit of paradise.<br>

Humans, with their ability to have sex for pleasure, are more advanced.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've heard this before, does us having sex for pleasure make us more advanced, or make animals (besides dolphins, and bonobos as you call them) more advanced to respect and cherish sex in a way we dont? <br>
<br>
Humans thought that God wanted them to renounce sex, and turned it into a shameful thing. There was a time when humans considered their sexual desires and activities to be natural, joyful functions of life. There was no shame or embarassment around them. ( Long ago ) Then cultural teachings changed that, making people think that to engage in sex openly and playfull and joyfully was &quot;indulging your lower nature,&quot; and was unpleasing to God. Some groups and religions even taught that the only way to holiness, or enlightenment, was to abstain from sex altogether.<br>
  Others saw that if everyone did this, the human race would disappear so they taught instead that sex was a &quot;necesarry&quot; part of life if new children were to be created, but that &quot;procreation&quot; was its sole purpose and only real justification.<br>
  This meant that sex for reasons other than making babies was not okay. Birth control was not okay, sex outside marriage became not okay, and sex among younger people was absolutely not okay.<br>
 Today, some of this has changed and there is a more lenient attitude toward sex in many places. Still, it can be difficult to capture the joyfulness if there must be &quot;sneaking&quot; and &quot;hiding&quot; going on. Put plainly, people are ashamed of themselves. Some humans beings have become ashamed of their own bodies.<br>
<br>
The Purpose of Sex:<br>
You must declare that for yourself. Everything in life has the purpose you give it. Things in life are not given a purpose, There is only a purpose to life itself. It is the purpose of life to provide you with an opportunity to announce and declare, create and experience, express and fulfill Who You Really Are. <br>
If you were told what to create, and how to create it, then you would not be creating at all. You would be simply be obeying. Remember: Obedience is not creation. Sex is a gift. Expressed and experienced responsibly, it is one of the most joyful, exciting parts of life. So go into the world, and celebrate who you are. Celebrate your skills and your talents, your hopes and your dreams, your passions and your visions.<br>
Celebrate all that makes you one with the Universe, and all that makes you unique. Yet when I say &quot;celebrate&quot; I do not mean be insensitive to others. Celebration is not about pushing something in another's face, or deliberately making<br>
people uncomfortable. Celebration is about the peaceful acceptance and the happy experience and the joyous expression of who you are. Celebration is always a contribution. You can tell if what you are doing is a celebration by looking at what it contributes to yourself and others. So there's nothing wrong with being &quot;different&quot; its how you impose yourself to others. So many people have so many contradicting opinions but you don't see, in fact, that its the other peoples opinions that makes yours special, different, and original and except others are who they are.<br>
