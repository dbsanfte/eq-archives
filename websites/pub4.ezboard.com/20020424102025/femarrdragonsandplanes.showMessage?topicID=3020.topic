This is just too good to let go.<br>
<br>
Below you will find two posts. Normally I do not care to copy entire posts<br>
since it makes the reading tedious. But the proof, is as they say, in the eating.<br>
Over the years I have had one theme that many many people have taken liberty<br>
to disagree with me on. Certain players consider themselves above obeying the rules. I have named them several times and taken untold flak for it. This player I have never accused of anything and he has been my chief detractor. Never failing<br>
to pop up and tell the board that I am unpleasant and insane, to say nothing<br>
of merely being wrong. But here his ego gives me what I could not get after<br>
3 years of harping. He confesses. Not only does he confess but he brags.<br>
It is MORE than obvious that he doesnt feel that 'he' needs to obey the rules<br>
at all. I am unconcerned with 'why' he did these things, the confession<br>
stands on its own merits. He was even kind enough to reply to my query<br>
on this topic.  For the people that stubbornly choose to believe that nothing<br>
I say is valid and that my running feud with certain people is without validity,<br>
I offer this. And Vendrix is just one player. Just one. Not even the major<br>
figure that strides across the server. If you assume he was alone in his actions<br>
look at his signature. Kzzern and Varixx were hardly the most notable necros.<br>
It is sad for the players who still play, that he implicated them as well.<br>
Still, it wasnt a revelation, at least not to me. Some people are just dicks.<br>
<br>
So I will pose you all this question. Why should YOU obey the rules when this<br>
'person' doesnt. Why is he so special? I suggest to you all he wasnt. That<br>
there were many such.  It is for such tidbits of validation that I linger here.<br>
These were bannable offenses, and he brags. Is that what Erollis Marr<br>
is? A playground for rule breakers?<br>
<br>
Nuldar, I already copied the posts. It wont matter if you delete them.<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
*************************************************************<br>
My Cleric had been level 50 for quite a while when I decided it was time to pickup where I left off with my Necro, Varixx, at level 45ish. So I remake all my hotkeys, put some gear on him and head to Lower Guk for some xp.<br>
<br>
I zone in, do the whole, “level 45 necro lfg” thing and within a few minutes I get a /tell from some group doing the Executioner and Sage area, sounds good to me. So I head down and we are doing pretty well, I speed up their kill rate a bit and the puller seems fine with going out and getting more. We switch rooms depending on when something is going to spawn. At some point it came time to move up to the Sage room and await the pops there, when Ewle strolls in, sits down right in the middle of my group, stands up and casts a pet. Right away I let her know that if she’s thinking of taking this spawn from us with no discussion what so ever, she’s got another thing coming.<br>
<br>
So a mob spawns and we attack it, as does she. I can’t exactly recall who got the kill, it was a moot point because I knew she was trying – and that just wasn’t going to happen on my watch. I warned her again, and she attacked the next mob, that did it. I told my group to exit the room and that I was going to disband so I didn’t get them into a pile of shit with her, or GMs. I tell them to sit tight in the Exe room and that I’ll have Ewle out of the Sage room in no time.<br>
<br>
So everyone clears out and the fun begins…<br>
<br>
I run down to the Cavalier room, full spawn with regular mobs. I solo pull one and bring it right to the Sage room while she’s fighting with something, and FD. Now, as you know, it’s fairly difficult to train someone who can FD, except someone who isn't smart enough to use their 3rd person perspective views. She managed to kill the one she was fighting and FD just after the add killed her pet, but she didn’t know that I stood up and tagged it, along with two roamers, as it was going home. So there were a total of three standing on me, just around the corner from her when she stood up, thinking it was safe.<br>
<br>
Ewle has been slain by a Froglock Wan Knight!<br>
<br>
/ all Ewle<br>
Ewle[50 Necromancer] &lt;Ebonlore&gt; East Commons<br>
There is one player in Everquest<br>
<br>
You tell Ewle, “hope you got you walking shoes on!”<br>
Ewle, “I petitioned you”<br>
<br>
I AFK for 5 minutes to roll around on the ground, laughing hysterically.<br>
<br>
15 minutes later, she’s back to get her corpse… I train her while she’s looting it.<br>
<br>
Ewle has been slain by a Froglock Wan Knight!<br>
<br>
/ all Ewle<br>
Ewle[50 Necromancer] &lt;Ebonlore&gt; East Commons<br>
There is one player in Everquest<br>
<br>
You tell Ewle, “you didn’t re-bind, hahah!”<br>
Ewle, “I petitioned you, you’re being watched”<br>
<br>
I take another AFK for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
She comes back and this time she’s smart enough to /corpse herself out of the Sage room before looting. She’s got a Cleric with her this time, I guess thinking that made her somewhat safer, to res her two existing corpses. I train her and the Cleric, then offer to drag him to the zone and get him a 49 res.<br>
<br>
/ all Ewle<br>
Ewle[50 Necromancer] &lt;Ebonlore&gt; East Commons<br>
There is one player in Everquest<br>
<br>
You tell Ewle, “pavlov’s dog &gt; Ewle”<br>
<br>
She didn’t have a comment this time, because she really did petition… that was a mistake. About this time Kzzern wanders in and I brief him to the situation, we decide that it’s payback time for everyone she’s fucked over in the months past and she wasn’t getting anything except xp loss, and she didn’t. So she gets her corpse(s) and, possibly a res, and then comes back down to the House of Pain – fool! Kzzern and I watched her from afar to see where she setup, this time it was near those Gargoyles just outside the Assassin room.<br>
<br>
She casts a pet and we nail her, from both sides I think. She manages to FD this time and a / Ewle shows that she went LD to clear agro, dumbass. We know where she went LD, we know she’s coming right back, so Kzzern and I park a casting Froglock right where she dropped and keep it Screaming Terror’d. When we see her log back in we FD, the Frog immediately agro’s her and she’s dead before she’s even in control – too bad(btw, still bound in EC…)!<br>
<br>
We take up positions to ruin her day, over and over again, when I get a /tell from someone important – Uini. I was told that Ewle was being watched closely(which meant I was being watch, uhhh… train her, closely) and Uini was looking for something, anything, to ban her for. So I kept a dialogue of taunting going between Ewle and myself. Hoping she would fuck up and admit to something… she did. Like someone mentioned, she made a comment about Uini’s hit points, letting the powers that be know she was using ShowEQ(they could have just looked on her web site and known). Exactly 2 minutes after my last tell to her, she was gone…<br>
<br>

**************************************************************<br>
**************************************************************<br>
But I think it IS revealing that Varixx openly admits that he broke the rules<br>
<br>
How is it revealing? I can say with utmost certainty that I never claimed to be a law abiding, upstanding citizen of EMarr. I helped some people and I punished others, repeatedly. I gave her two warnings, she didn’t relent and she was in the wrong. Therefore I felt justified in dealing with her by whatever means necessary, and I did.<br>
<br>
WITH the help of Kzzern/Koryo many times<br>
<br>
He only helped once, I take the blame for that as well(I didn’t write the story to get people in trouble, just state the facts as they happened).<br>
<br>
Uini apparently KNEW they were doing it<br>
<br>
I can’t say that she knew I had trained Ewle on purpose, for sure. I could have just been a really bad puller, a really bad Necro puller, a really bad Necro puller who just happened to feign large quantities of Froglocks on Ewle three times in 45 minutes – stranger things have been known to happen.<br>
<br>
I can only wonder why they didnt find LUCAS and do that to him.<br>
<br>
It’s pretty hard to train someone whose training someone else.<br>
<br>
Only when they rained on Varixx parade did it motivate him to do something. Very insightfull. It really is.<br>
<br>
No one elected me to the Emarr task force to combat organized idiots, of course I'm only going to deal with it if it affects me. She brought her style of play to me, I dealt with it using her tactics. It was eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth – Hammurabi would have been pleased.<br>
<br>
How fortunate that you cant really train a monk.<br>
<br>
Sure you can! I killed Mitch and some other Monk with one of my ‘Enforced Darwinism’ trains in Velk’s lab when the zone population grew too high(Hoth still has me beat for most people killed in one Velk’s train though, bastard!). It was a piece of cake. You bring enough shit with no warning, everyone dies… except the hidden Rogue you use to keep an eye on when things are coming and when you should zone the Cleric you used to pull the train…<br>
<br>
personaly I would have banned Vendrix and Kzzern too, but then I'm just a bitch at times<br>
<br>
I would have had your house towed.<br>

<br>
1) Based on your statements in the Pretty women (now about the police) thread, I find it entertaining that you can attack Vendrix for acting as if he's above the rules.  From that thread, especially the keg story, I would infer that you yourself think that it's OK to break the law, as long as you don't get caught/busted.<br>
<br>
2) Ewle pretty much deserved whatever she got.  She trained people herself, campstole, etc.  And (probably) did it far more often than Vendrix has.  Plus, in Vendrix' story, it sounds like Ewle was trying to move in and take over someone's camp.  From your thread on Blackhawk Down (now about WW2), you've stated that there are cases where there is justification for war.  In this silly little virtual world we play in, Ewle's actions were essentially acts of war, and thus responding in kind should not be a surprise.  After all, war isn't pretty, and in times of war, involved parties often do things they wouldn't consider doing otherwise.<br>

<br>
Vendrix, who admittedly broke the rules in pursuit of vengeance and justice and wound up freeing EMarr from one of the worst sack of shits who ever played EQ, and is also partly responsible for proving to Verant that there were large scale LD's occurring during high end raids;<br>
<br>
and Chiteng, who . . . um, is best known for annoying the hell out of people on the EMarr boards.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reposting that gem from Vendrix, it really made my day during this enforced downtime!<br>
<br>
But as for your own point, which seems to boil down to this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is that what Erollis Marr<br>
is? A playground for rule breakers?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you don't like the playground, get the hell out of the sandbox and go home!  Once again you're harping on something that happened two years ago.  The plain fact of the matter is that despite breaking the rules to do so, Vendrix performed us a huge service by helping Uini nail Ewle to the wall.  And not only that, he did to Ewle what Ewle had been doing to countless other people: He trained her.  Over and over again.  That's justice, whether or not rules were broken.<br>
<br>
As the British band Black Box Recorder says,<br>

You are willing to smear your own brand of crazy onto everyone else's opinions this time, and it crashes and burns so hard that it's nothing short of pathetic.  But then, what else is new?<br>
<br>
The connection you try to make between Vendrix' past actions and things he has said smearing you is so beyond tenuous that really only someone that knows you and how completely off your rocker you are might be able to make the link.<br>

My other posts are extraeneous to that issue. In addition<br>
he braggs that he killed Mitch. Mitch is not Ewle.<br>

That would indicate a pattern of rule breaking. A pattern of holding himself<br>
above the rules. That isnt news to me. <br>

My point is that this player for three years has portrayed me as<br>
insane, and wrong. Now he validates exactly what my points were.<br>

I think at this point and time its time for you to reread the Mitch Vs. Chuk Vs Dwark wars.  Take the posts where they all tell &lt;insert one of the 3 here&gt; to go away we dont want them here anymore, and assume they are talking too you from now on.<br>
<br>
You bother us.  We dont care.  We didnt then, we sure as well wont now.  Does it bother me that Vendrix broke the rules?  No, why?  Because he isnt the first person and wont be the last person to do so.  If there were strict limitations that punished players for doing so, yes then maybe I would because then it'd actually mean a damn.  As it stands, no one gives a flying fuck about your stupid ass crusades against Vendrix, Kzzern, Dakor, gimp_newbie_135, your grandmother or that dog you ran over on your way to the message boards.<br>
<br>
Go away, we dont love you anymore.<br>

As far as training MItch it was obviously a mistake if he then rezzed and gave her eggo.<br>

Bottom is line you win.  He admitted to breaking a rule for the sake of giving back a little shit to a known shit giver.  Is it over now?<br>

No, we dont give a damn what happened to Ewle.  Check back at the post where he said he killed Mitch, did Mitch seem offended and upset over it?  I'm sure Vendrix did it on purpose, obviously thats why he ressed her afterwards.  Trains happen, they wont stop simply because you sit up on your high horse and wish for it to go away.<br>
<br>
Vendrix did train Ewle intentionally.  He, like everyone else, didnt care for her antics and decided to retaliate after she tried to push them off on him.  Do I think its right that he did this?  Nope.  Do I care?  Not one damn bit, because she went out of her way to malisciously hurt anyone she came across if she so whimmed, so for me, its justified.<br>
<br>
Your posts have exceeded the point that even I cant tolerate them.  And I'm willing to put up with most of the ignorant shit thats posted on these boards.  Some are amusing, some are annoying, some are offensive.  Yours fits in the roadkill that just wont die.<br>

Wrong.  Most of us havent denied anything, this is something you fabricated for yourself when you realized that 90% of us dont give a damn.  We didnt then and your find that most of sure as hell dont give a damn now.<br>
<br>
There's also the fact that your turning these &quot;facts&quot; into something else.  All your previous issues with Vendrix have been over other pity stupid issues that have come up, not this issue with Ewle.  Because he did something wrong with Ewle doesnt mean that everything negative that has ever happened is a result of Vendrix.  Stop trying to turn one situation to your own, as it isnt going to do a damn thing for you.<br>
<br>
If I havent said it enough, I'll say it again.  We dont care, now go away.  Next time you want to get everyone on a bandwagon to kill a wolf, dont run around town being a complete jackass screaming wolf when its not there.  We're tired of listening too you.  Go talk to Jerry, maybe he'll host you on his show where you can bitch about EQ addicts and their rule breaking and how we didnt raise arms with you when you tried to be the center of the EQ world.<br>
