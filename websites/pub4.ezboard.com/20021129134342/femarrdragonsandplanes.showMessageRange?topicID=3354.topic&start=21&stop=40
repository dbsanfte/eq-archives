<br>
Pottery and Baking are &quot;fun&quot; skills not really serious ones like JC, Smithing or Tailoring.  Those 3 are *HARD* to get up, insanely hard and expensive.  Most Jewelers will combine stuff for thier friends and sometimes guild at cost.  Usually because the guild and sometimes friends helped them get thier craft up by giving them pp when they could.  This is very generous of them.  I have always been touched when a Jeweler has been kind enough to do this for me.  They spent tons of real time getting that skill up and I respect that.  Maybe that's why so many of my friends are so nice about helping me cause I don't just &quot;expect&quot; it like its some perk I get for playing EQ on the same server as them.<br>
<br>
Ok maybe it was more then one thing. <p>Evelle High Priestess

I'm not looking for a fight, I'm not suggesting you're wrong, but I am saying I don't agree with you 100%.  Not agreeing with you is no crime, and not being in agreement means little to dictate who is right and who is wrong.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
BTW, your RL examples of Lotery Tickets, Lawyers, etc are not fitting here. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Once again, I disagree.  You KNOW there is a margin for error on the jewelers part, but you decide to take that chance anyway.  It's all a game of chance.  That's all I am saying.  You take that chance with the jeweler that they'll make the item and you suck up the losses.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
This is a game. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So is gambling.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Yes, I completely understand the cost of Jewlery making compared to costs at raising all other skills. It is the most expensive, but does that really entail one has to pay for the PCs time to hit the combine button when there are failures?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I can ask the same question in a different light.  Does a jeweler <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> have</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to suck up the losses and walk away with nothing?  No.  But we can't forget about the time it took that PC to get to the skill where they can credibly push that button whilst boasting a 250 skill.  Any idiot can hit a button, but that's not what we pay traders for.  We pay them for the time they invested.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
You will not get to charge fees like a lawyer and it is doubtful you will obtain the winning lottery ticket by logging into EQ. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's still all about putting your money in the hands of fate.  I pay the lawyer I have the most faith in to win my case for me, and I pay the jeweler with the highest skill to make my items for me.  One example is on a big scale, one example is on a small scale.  I can twist your example by saying paying a lawyer won't get you a platinum ruby veil, also.  But twisting our analogies won't get us anywhere.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
This is a game and time spent in it should be solely for fun.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ideally, yes, but you do put work into the game to get where you are.  And when you have this many people coming together on a large scale such as we have on EQ, you're bound to have problems.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
If grinding through skill lvls isn't fun, or one thinks they are entitled to reimbursement for their work at raising their skill level, then I submit they didn't work the skill for the fun and probably shouldn't have took up the skill it to begin with.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, it's a fine ideal.  I play this game because I like having equipment, I like having the levels, but I hate the work I have to put into it.  The satisfaction I get from the end product and the fruits of my labor, however, are enough incentive to keep me going.  Not everybody's as easy going about their hobbies, though, but I admire you for being able to stick by that.  I, however, don't have fun combining shafts, nocks, tips and fletches for hours on end, though.  I like having the skill, and that's what keeps me going.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I say... have fun and when someone is getting bent out look for a win/win situation. Again, what is so difficult with that? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you're big enough of a person to do that, good on you.  But if someone deserves something, not everybody's going to compromise themselves to please everybody, and they shouldn't be expected to.  <br>
<br>
Basically, we're in disagreement over one question.  Why doesn't someone in that situation just give the money back?  You're on the side of 'why not?' and I'm on the side of 'why should he?'<br>
<br>
My tenent is that I'm not here to baby people and make sure I make nicey nice with everybody.  It's impossible to make sure everybody loves me without compromising my own virtues and my personal code of ethics.  If I feel something is due upon me, and that all parties involved had agreed upon that, then by all means, it's mine.  If I felt I had been disengenous in any way or unclear about the matter at hand, then I would give.  <br>
<br>
Your sentiments are all very noble and very ideal, but unfortunately cannot be made a reality upon everybody.  I'm not a philanthropist, but I give charity where it is most needed.  I don't give my charity freely for the sake of general harmony.<br>
<br>
I'm only saying what I'm saying, elaborating the points to make clearer why it is I disagree.  If you're so offended (from what I gather from the overall tone of your reply) by people seeing things differently than you, then disregard what I say and forget I ever said anything.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
However, in order to avoid needless conflict it is advisable (not necessary mind you) to do your best by your fellow PC IG. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If I call you a fvcking, pompous, snotty little know-it-all of a  moron will you agree with me to avoid needless conflict?  (Note: that was sarcasm)  Honey, you couldn't even take my initial, civil reply without getting your feathers ruffled, let's not even talk about name-calling, having your reputation slandered, and having a bad night for doing something you thought was nice.<br>
<br>
The point is this.  The customer understood the terms of service and agreed to them.  The customer was unhappy afterwards with the terms he had agreed to.  The customer proceeded to accuse the seller that she was a scammer (insinuating foul play and outright deceit on the seller's part) when that was the furthest thing from the truth.  He got what he paid for.  <br>
<br>
I feel you're perhaps preaching to the wrong party about avoiding needless conflict.  If anybody should hear this, it's Maxzimos. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uglorianafrostglitter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gloriana Frostglitter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1441<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/22/02 3:35:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3354.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maxzimos accuses me of scamming? /laff</span><hr size=1> Hmmm, why don't you ask Quistil how easy/cheap it is to become a Grand Master Potter?   <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/gloriana.html"><img src="http://fyd.fuxored.net/glorymedium.jpg" border="0"></a><p>

We were grouped and he saw the fail message and immediately after i alerted him to the failure and apologised he started with the accusation in /say in the ec tunnel no less.<br>
<br>
Aishen has pretty much summed up in her last post how i feel about the situation. I could sit here and say i was considering giving back 47pp after i saw the fail msg but in reality i wasnt. If theres a failure on a combine and ive made the conditions crystal clear the customer needs to realise that no i wont give his 50pp or 20% combining fee back. <br>
<br>
I spent alot of pp getting to 250 and im not in the league of charging high prices for my jewelcraft...simply because if i DO fail then that customer isnt out of pocket some HUGE amount of plat. <p><center><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/flickglowing.gif">

<br>
Agreed. The tone of this thread is amusing considering what is at stake. hehehe<br>
<br>
<i>"Lurikeen would you be willing to oblige to a customers demands after they've insulted you?"</i><br>
<br>
Flickering, I worked in the customer service field a very long time. I am a network engineer now and still have to work with internal customers. In the real world one still has to oblige the customer's demands even if insulted. <br>
<br>
This is a game, as you know Flickering. In this game you don't have to oblige the customer's demands. They insult you, you tell them to fu<i></i>ck off and die.<br>
<br>
I am sorry some jerk began to flame you as a scammer in EC. However, I would just suck it up and be done with it. Personally, I wouldn't have even brought the incident to this board, since it really isn't noteworthy. Just some dude who lost a couple hundred plat. Who knows how much he had and how long he worked for what he gave you. Yes, he was rude, but also might have lost alot of plat, to him. Sure, it isn't your problem. Certainly he was wrong to be a jerk.<br>
<br>
I can't blame you for being angry and then bringing this small incident to the board to notify us all what a jerk he is. You are within your rights.<br>
<br>
Personally, I would have given him his 20% that I charged on top, thereby covering my costs of the gems and biting the loss of the  time it took me to click combine. Then I would have put his ass on /ignore and never dealt with him again. <br>
<br>
Sorry it doesn't make sense to you or to some others. I can't say that I care. I am just saying what I would have done. Take it or leave it. =) <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 3967<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/22/02 8:33:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3354.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maxzimos accuses me of scamming? /laff</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Personally, I wouldn't have even brought the incident to this board, since it really isn't noteworthy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Oh, my poor dear Flickering...<br>
This is Frekkels.  I was a little abrupt w/ you at Eqtrader's over this issue.  This was EXACTLY the reason.  I didn't want to go into it there, as the topic of that thread was on pricing, and I didn't want to debate your methods. You stated your policy clearly, and that was enough for that thread.<br>
<br>
For this Maxzimos character and the deal you had w/ him...<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I do NOT think what you did was wrong.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
From what you said in your post, it seems things were made very clear to him.  Buyer beware, he should have sucked up the tough loss (and it wasn't even a very big one really).  I DO understand how people can misunderstand though...  Maybe even how people who DO understand can pretend NOT to after a failure (esp. when they brought the bar and gem) in order to take advantage of someone soft-hearted.  I applaud you sticking to your guns.  Returning 20%, or any amount would not teach this guy anything.  Maybe you lost a customer there, but perhaps there is a wiser consumer now. (Which I doubt, sadly enough.)<br>
<br>
I like MY customers (for jewelry, smithing, tailoring, pottery, whatever!) happy, and clicking for a combine fee leaves the possibility of leaving them unhappy (even if they understood the chance of a loss), which is why I'm loathe to operate the way you do.  I always TRY to offer a made product, and if they want to supply part of the components for that product, (like a BD for example) I give them a discount for my estimation of the fair market value of the component(s) the client brought me.  If I don't think I can successfully craft the piece, I refer them to someone else. <br>
<br>
This isn't always possible, so I sometimes have to deal with your method.  When I do, I ALWAYS have them grouped for the combine.  (Did you?  I didn't notice whether you said you did or not.)  I also darn near make them repeat back to me what the possibilities are, so there is no room for misunderstanding.  With new clients, I avoid this method almost entirely, as my experience has left me with nothing but headaches.<br>
<br>
You offer a fantastic service to those who are not capable of crafting their own jewelry.  It is a service I don't generally offer.  However, making jewelry the way you do leaves you open to criticism from idiots like Maxzimos, no matter how blatantly wrong he is. Even if you put him on /ignore, the effects of Maxidiot /shouting &quot;Flickering is a scammer, took my pp and gave me nothing!!!&quot; (only in all caps most likely) might hurt your EC tunnel business for awhile.  Up to you if you want to keep at it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It isn't worth the heartache for me.  Obviously, he got under your skin or you wouldn't have posted here.  False accusations are a horrible thing to live with. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
