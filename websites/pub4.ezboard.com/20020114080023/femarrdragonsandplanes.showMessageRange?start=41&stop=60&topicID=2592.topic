<br>
I seriously doubt he said anything about your guild being shitty but I do know that you were whining and bitching about him oweing you a scroll and being extremely rude to someone WHO WAS NOT EVEN THE FUCKING RAID LEADER.  So he told you to go to hell that he didn't owe you anything and to get your own fucking guild to do it. (that sounds a lot more famaliar doesn't it)  Korarlei isn't even in Gorndax's guild, so to me you sound more and more like the liar in this crowd so why don't you quit your damn whining.<br>

Gwen had gone LD before he even asked me to come and recruit my friends.  She never came back from the time he took over to the time all the corpses we summoned from the queen.  According to your philosiphy when the raid leader goes LD and someone else takes over they have no responsibility for leading.  He was in charge.  He made a promise.  He broke a promise.  And whatever you want to think about your RL friend he the Champions of Marr are a shitty guild just like the one I left not to long ago.  I could get on and do /who all GUILD and I would be lucky if 7 people were on.  I told him that he shouldn't talk about things he doesn't know and should feel free to do a /who champ all at any time to see how strong we are.  Your right he isn't in gorn's guild yet.  maybe that's because they can't get 10 people to start it.  And Molt I don't know how could possibly think that it's a compliment for someone to tell you to leave your guild and that they aren't capable of getting you your epic, but I for one think it is very insulting and way off base.  You are just like Korarlei was that night talking out your about things you don't know.  you are not in CoM and you don't know how our people think and feel.  To this day you ask just about anyone in game how they feel about any champ member they have grouped with and they will say it was a wonderful experience.  Lastly to Goodfellow.  I wasn't there for Ixi.  I wasn't needed for ixi.  If you read the post you would know I didn't agree to come until it was NBG roll.  You also know I gave you a tell in game before I came and you said you were bowing out since you weren't at that step.  I don't care that sinangel in 59.  You know what I meant by NBG meaning at this step.  That meant everyone that was rolling only need the king and RF.  What a concept that's all I needed too.  So obviously since you knew you weren't going to roll you didn't pay attention because it was very clear before I recruited my friends that we would roll on all scrolls.<br>

First off being the raid leader doesnt mean you are in charge of looting.  Loot is such a pain I pawn off handling that to someone else.  That involves all special loot rights etc.  Vishanti said she was handling loot.  Vishanti had the clerics discuss among them what was going on.  To Vishanti she saw how the loot was going the way it happened (first to sinangel).  And, &quot;When the Overking died, I mentioned that the clerics had already agreed to give the scroll to Sinangel.&quot;  Korarlei who seemed to have taken over the raid to get the clerics these items was told this.  Dont blame him for being told by the loot handler what to tell the raid for loot.  If this was wrong then accept at some point something got messed up.  God, everyone has done it.  I know half the people involved, and neither Korarlei, BC, or Vishanti would ever scam someone out of loot.  <br>
<br>
Darikan, you have the right to be upset.  Shit happens.  I am assuming that instead of just saying shit, thats not the way it was supposed to be, you made a huge hassle on the leaders.  They are under stress man, especially if something they wanted that was morale and fair got broken by mistake.  Your statement about what korarlei said was not a direct quote, and I really dont think its fair to but out a bold statment like that if it isnt.  One word can mean a large difference in the meaning.  If he said something derogitory to you, it was probally because he was pissed that everything was going right and now someone is trying to break the raid because of a mistake.  Expressing your problem in tells in a calm fashion probally would have been much better and they probally would have fixed that problem in a way that would work (stay until you got the scroll).<br>
<br>
Now to what Molt said.  We both have friends in their.  In fact, we both *were* in the Champions, probally longer than most members today are.  She mentioned that there were good members in it, so dont get defensive because she made it verbally known her concerns for leaving.  I really doubt what Molt said about the epic thing was anything more of sacrasim than maybe Darikan you misread or took it a way Korarlei didnt mean.<br>
<br>
And now about me.  How the hell did I even get mentioned?  When this was happening i was in an exam lol.  Darikan why did you even try and badmouth the guild we have going with<br>
&quot;Your right he isn't in gorn's guild yet. maybe that's because they can't get 10 people to start it.&quot;  Finding a place to vent is low, dont even try that on me.  A much simpler thought would be... maybe its being approved by the GMs?  <br>

Let me fill everyone in on some information:<br>
<br>
I formed up the groups and led the raid down into chardok that day.  Korarlei handled control of 3 of the groups, Crom handled 3 others, I ran the 7th.  Before the raid started we assigned looting AND loot policy to Vishanti.  This is not in dispute.<br>
<br>
AT NO TIME WHATSOEVER was I ever informed that Darikan was coming with conditions.  He said he was coming, I said okay and put him in.<br>
<br>
When loot time came after the king was killed, I said lets have the clerics roll.  Vishanti said no, the clerics had decided before we came in that sinangel would get the first drop.  Kor AND bekki AND sinangel AND vishanti all agreed this was the way it had been decided.  Since Vishanti was running the loot, I backed her and said Sin gets it.<br>
<br>
Whether its wrong or right you can debate forever.  The fact of the matter is that 4 players said a certain thing had been decided, and 1 said that that wasn't true.  In the interests of keeping the raid going I went with the 4 AND the loot handler's word.<br>
<br>
Flame on if you want... but remember just how many people out there organize chardok raids before you rip in too hard... you may not get another chance to go back in.<br>

    Wow!  I'm impressed, did you think of that all by yourself??   Pull your head out of your ass and you might find all the wood you need.  Darikan wasn't being a martyr, he came here to post a gripe which is what this board is FOR btw.  You didn't argue one fact or discuss any points, you just got on to show what its like to be in 8th grade again.  Go whipe off your nose, and get someone to tie your shoes for you so you can run along, I'm sure your mommy is calling you to come to dinner before it gets dark outside.  If any wood is needed here its to beat you with it till you lie in a puddle of your own blood.   <br>
<br>
And now, back to our regularly scheduled program...<br>
<br>
Shit does happen, and when it gets to harder and more difficult quests and the like, it does get more stressful for everyone.  It also makes the *mistakes* or *deceit* much more painful and less likely to be blown off.  Incidentally its also those exact times when people DON'T act like they normally do, so it doesn't matter if you've known X your whole game life.  Inordinate amounts of pressure make folks act differently than they might otherwise normally.  It's not just coincidence that alot of folks quit in the 50-60 range and it aint just boredom either.  Go apply for a house loan, get told you are approved, sell your house and pack, and then get told &quot;oops, sorry, no loan for joo.&quot;  This is just a RL analogy but it would definately be more stressful than &quot;shit, my cocoa pebbles didn't have the decoder ring in it!!&quot;  There was definately some miscommunication, but it doesn't seem to be *honest* miscommunication.   <br>
<br>
     While its true that what is done is done, everyone can either let the rift stay and new friendships/enemies be made, or can try to find some way to make everyone happy.  Someone had a great idea, on the random and raid if Darikan wins.  I even saw some folks say they would go.  I think that that motion alone, and if folks committed to doing it (not just new folks this time, but folks that were there too) it would make everyone happy.  Sure some folks now don't give a shit or feel the need to do anything, but if you step back and look at the bigger picture, you'll see that it'd be good for everyone.<br>
<br>
Besides, you all did it once, after watching several guilds work together yesterday over 12 hours and fail 3-4 times on King and never succeed, doing it twice would be a huge accomplishment.  Hell, maybe you'd do King twice in half the time and both clerics get the scroll.  <br>
<br>
Or maybe you'll step up, make the roll, and Darikan won't win.  Then nobody goes, but still, everyone feels better.<br>

Besides i have friends in CoM. I simply asked why he didn't have CoM go to chardok and get his scroll. He answers because i like to have the chance to get it when ever a oppertunity is givin. I replyed to him by asking if  the realese of DAoC could have weakend the CoM guild, like it did my old guild causing my old guild to become shitty because we just didn't have the people to raid anymore. True i did not know for sure about this in CoM, that is why i asked him a question and not give a statement.<br>
Second i only took responsiblity of leading this raid because gywenth went LD and could not return and i figuard since we had all the people their already wanting to go to chardok we could just bring in reenforcements and continue. As bridgecrusher got the groups together Darikan sends me a tell asking me if he can come only if he has loot rights to the first scroll since it was the last piece he needed for complition of his epic. I replyed that would not be fair to the other clerics. His reply was then that he would not come and would not bring any help unless he had loot rights. By this time i had found out that sinangel and bekki needed this to complete their epics also. Some how he found this out about the same time i did and sent me a tell saying he would come if it could be NBG rolled between the 3. I agreed to his terms and made sure that the other clerics understood this.<br>
Third thing we are getting ready to go into chardok i send sinangel a tell and tell her what is going to happen about the scroll. She replys that bekki and darikan had decided that they would not roll against sinangel since she is the highest and had been there the entire raid. I replyed thats awful kind of them with a smile.Bekki was in my group so i send her a tell asking if this was true and she said yes im defaulting because sinangel is higher and darikan is defaulting because he showed up late. I reply with an OK.<br>
Fourth thing why did i not ask darikan about this through the entire 4hr raid? Well at the first i was trying to get everything ready to go i had umpteen people sending me tells when they could be there, who they had to go pick up etc... Group leaders sending tells with group status. When we get in there we begin fighting and i was the MA for the raid. By the time we get to the prince it had already slipped my mind to ask him. Finely we get to the king and queen area we pull king and he goes down  we all cheer i send the vis a tell and say that the other two clerics that would have rolled defaulted to sinangel. She replys with OK. <br>
Fifth and final thing I did not attend to be lied to about this situation i can not help it if i was trying to keep the raid running smoothly and targeting mobs to have people assist me. I will say it once again as i did many many times that night i am sorry you got screwd darikan but there is nothing i can do about it now. I am also sorry that i was lied too and caused you to get screwd but i DO NOT appreciate the fact that you would keep sending me tell after tell after tell  yelling at me about the fact that you got screwd was my fault, and it was my responsibility to get you another scroll. I told you what you could do if you wanted me to get you another scroll but you insisted on staying with CoM thats fine do what you want to it is your choice not mine, but that was the only way i could help you get your scroll.  <br>

I post here for one purpose and one purpose only. To entertain myself. None of this stuff is real or frankly all that important. The game is fantasy, this board is fantasy and your insistence that any of it is of any importance is but mere fantasy as well.  Rants and Flames give me something to laugh about during my work day, and really when it comes right down to it, the purpose of rants and flames is childish in nature. Lighten up wise ass and see things for what they really are, not what diluded fantasy you wish them to be. If someone wants to make themselves an easy target, then expect them to get shot. I do it to myself on numerous occasions, and people dont miss the chance to take shots at me. Just remember, NONE of this is real. So flame on, and take your shots, I will when the spirit so moves me to do so.<br>

<br>
If I took this stuff personal I'd be pissed.  But since it isn't, and I'm not, I'll just make sure not to have anything to do with you, Toein, or Darikan.  Hope you find someone who wants to let you in on a chardok raid after this flame fest.<br>

Hell, its just a game.  So lets just take it to the game shall we?<br>

Specifically I was responding to post fucker boy, or whatever it is their name is, But thats ok, my rant and flame posts are designed to get a rise, so they did the job. I could care less about chardok the actual spirit of this thread and any of the rest of it. I just like to be entertained and I always get a chuckle out of these things. and it's always fun to get peoples goad. Cause well none of this stuff matters nor does it effect what I will eat for dinner.<br>

<br>
You were right in one assessment. Everquest is a game of pixels, with limited, if any, pertenance to the outside world. It's also a worthless game encumbered with pixels that you spend a hell of a lot of time at, at least if you &quot;earned&quot; those 54 levels. So, in your double standard ways, I guess it's ok for you to spend actual days of your life playing something worthless, but it's not worth getting upset over.<br>
<br>
I suppose you wouldn't mind if I spent every hour online training you, or killstealing your monsters..or perhaps I would get in close, become friends, and then whenever we killed something with a rare drop, I'd snag it, and gate out. <br>
<br>
Of course you wouldn't, you dense fucking troll. You'd be pissed off, and you'd probably post on the boards or tell people in game about what a dick I was being, to prevent them from being hosed too. Then again, that requires a common decency and a set of morals, which run pretty expensive in trailer parks I hear....(tell hi to your ma for me)<br>
<br>
What makes this game so addictive is the multiplayer purpose of it. The thoughts, ideals, and goals of other people come into play, and it becomes more than a bunch of pixels. It becomes an exntension of the self. Your thoughts, your time, your ideals. You'd care if it happened to you, hypocritical bitch.<br>
<br>
Also, just because not everyone can get their epic doesn't mean it isn't a worthy goal. He's not in an uber guild, and he's doing what he can to achieve what he wants, and you degrade him for it? What would you have him do? Wallow in a pool of his own tears? Just because you're too much of a pussy to take the initiative doesn't mean you should condemn him.<br>
<br>
And finally, you can hide behind the pathetic guise that you only do this for fun, and it doesn't matter to you, but whenever you realize that what you do in the flesh doesn't matter either, and that your mind, and your morals are the saving grace of your wasted life, remember when I took the time out of my day to address your pathetic ass.<br>
