<br>
Now we all know african-americans(or is it black? or just African? or just American? or Negro? I'm confused) call each other &quot;niggers&quot;.  Now if I(as a white man) walked up to a group of black people, and said &quot;sup mah niggers(niggas is actually more accurate)?&quot; I would proceed to either be forced to run for my life or act like a mastadon against the sabretooths and try to take a few out before their numbers brought me down(if you know me irl you know the latter is more likely :P).  Now I would never do such a thing, but why is it ok for black people to call each other &quot;niggers&quot; but they get offended when white/asian/purplespacealiens do?<br>
<br>
Thats my first question.<br>
<br>
My second question is about the homosexual culture. Do homosexuals run up to each other and yell &quot;wassup my fag?&quot; or &quot;how's it hanging my queer?&quot; with the same sort of comeraderie as all my black friends seem to enjoy calling each other &quot;niggers&quot;?   While I haven't seen this, I only know one openly gay person and thats only passingly, so there's a good chance I would have missed it(I live it Tennessee, not the best place to be a homosexual I'd assume).<br>
<br>
That said, may I close with a &quot;peace out&quot; to &quot;my honkies&quot; and a disclaimer that I do not want to offend anyone, just find this hugely ironic and humerous. Toodles.<br>
<br>

PS: Why do I feel all the sudden as though being a white, heterosexual male makes me a minority all the sudden?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzariel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zariel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/9/01 10:39:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Double standards?</span><hr size=1> Well, I do know that among some homosexuals, the term "queer" has been claimed as a pride word.  As in, "We're here, we're queer, get used to it," a slogan I've heard many times.  The Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender group at my brother's college had student members who helped those who were coming out.  They called themselves "queer peers".  And a certain group at my college called themselves "QuAc" which stood for "Queer Activists."  They mostly campaigned to get buildings redesigned for better handicapped access.  In my experience, it was fine for a heterosexual to call them "queer" -- they tended to assume it was with non-malicious intent.<br>
I don't think that homosexuals generally call each other "fag" or "dyke".  (Okay, even typing that turns my stomach....)  I think people are more likely to use a term when and where they feel safe about it -- for example, some of my bisexual female friends will call themselves "half-dyke" but only among friends.  They don't want to offend anyone -- or endanger themselves.  I also think that a person who has had a negative term (like the slurs for homosexuals above) used against him or her is less likely to use it against another person.<br>
The use of the racial slur Gilgamel mentioned is another example of a perjorative term being turned into a pride word.  Nonetheless, I wouldn't use it.  I don't think I could use it, and to hear others use it as a slur or insult makes me sick.<br>

<br>
Also, no Person (especially if he/she is white) would honestly claim she used the Term &quot;Nigger&quot; without actually refering to Afro-Americans, but just meaning (Quoting Draeken) &quot;stupidity or lameness.&quot;<br>
<br>
What the example <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> good for is to try get a Point across to all those Backwood Rednecks who still believe the KKK-Ramblings on how Homosexuality is some sort of strange Dementia or mental illness that was caused by too much contact to Homosexuals, wrong Education, whatever, and could possibly be cured.<br>

<br>
Why is there a blacks only club allowed in schools, when a whites only club is taboo?<br>
<br>
Why is there the NAACP when there's poor white trash that need hand me ups too? And advancement based on skin color... hmmmm.<br>
<br>
The other day I heard on the news how hundreds of black people fell for a social security scam in Houston when some people sent them letters saying that they would recieve extra compensation for slavery..<br>
Am I just forgetful or did slavery end when my great great grandfather died? Cause I never had slaves, my father never had slaves, and black people today aren't slaves.. yet we apologize and repay them today just like they where all slaves yesterday..<br>
<br>
TV stations that play nothing but black sitcoms. Yeah, okay I admit that there's TV shows out there with all white line up's. But the magority of the one's I see have at least ONE colored man/woman in the cast. As opposed to Fresh  Prince/Martin/etc. where I have yet to see a white person. **even though some of the episodes are humorous**<br>
<br>
People need to just get over the fact they don't look alike and just cooperate as a whole. God damn. And yes I did say God damn.<br>
<br>
PS Also, woman get almost as many double standards as colored's do. Which blows major ass as well.<br>
<br>
You meet a chick, ya'll go out and have a beer. One beer. She wants to go over to your place, you guys have hot steamy sex. The next morning she's gone when you wake up, that afternoon you're under arrest for rape.

Don't ya love paranoia...<br>
<br>
The NAACP was created at a time when blacks truly needed a leg up, when integration and equality were glimpses on the horizon.  Unfortunately now it stands as a dividing line, a source of factionalization instead of unification.  It's largely outlived it's usefulness as a bastion of civil rights and now mostly plays the role of defender and/or instigator depending on the situation.<br>
<br>
But, hell yes they should be worried about a group of whites forming a club.  As far as equality has come it still has a long way to go.  And it really hasn't been all that long since the klan and it's cronies were active... 20 years roughly?  Barely long enough to drop out of public memory.<br>
<br>
The simple fact this thread was started shows there is some flame left smoldering in those charcoals.<br>
<br>
The original post:<br>
It's not a matter of double standards.. it's a matter of double meaning.  Or, more specifically, a matter of connotations.  The word "nigger" (or nigga) has different connotations depending on the group saying it and/or listening to it.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why someone would waste the time or brain power on starting a thread like this.<br>
Are you mad you can't call a black man nigger?  If so, that's sad and pathetic - it truly shows how far we've come.  If not, then shut the fuck up, what does it matter if they use some word that you shouldn't - are you losing something here?<br>
<br>
When it all comes down - we the white man still hold the vast majority of the power in this country.  Yes we hear more and more of the *insert minority group* but blame that on media and warped statistics.  Then go out and find where the majority of those *minority* live, eat, breathe, go to school, work, vote, etc.<br>
<br>
And no i'm not blaming anyone for their state of living, it's just the plain facts.<br>
<br>
And above about the black sitcoms...<br>
Roughly 2 years ago all 5 of the big stations (NBC, ABC, CBS, WB, Fox) took heat for cancelling a majority of their "minority" targetted line ups.... because *drumroll* they weren't selling.<br>
<br>
Ugh, how many "black" sitcoms are out there? 2, 3?  Honestly, I have no clue, but I'm sure it's VERY few in comparison to the amount of "white" entertainment.... and don't mention the token minority, those are largely there to provide a target for the occasional *minority* based joke.<br>
<br>
Sum:<br>
<br>
A lot of the minority "civil rights" institutions have outlived their viability and now create undue tension... thereby drawing more lines and factionalizing people when we really need unity.<br>
<br>
But, white man still holds the power, and will for the foreseeable future.  Even so, isn't it time to share the power?  Does seeing a "black" sitcom offend you somehow?  I find them refreshingly different... a unique perspective on this thing we call life.  <br>
<br>
Do I have to point out that the vast majority of consumer goods, mass entertainment, and television marketing are geared toward the white demographic... it's not even a close margin, it's a proverbial landslide... right now THE most sought after market in all of consumerdom is the 24 to 35 year old WHITE couple.<br>
<br>
What's happening right now is us white folks are finally hearing about the minorities in our cherished media.  And it's shocking to us that we're not in the limelight 24/7 anymore... we're finding it hard to share that limelight.. or share the job market, or the television spot... we're being forced to share and we don't like it! We don't want to hear about it!  We want it all to go away!  Can't we return to the days of Leave It to Beaver!<br>
<br>
Ugh.. that last bit was sarcasm in case you didn't notice.<br>

Most homosexuals have little problems being called queer, gay, Lesibian...But some have problems with Fag, Dyke, Polesmoker, Rugmuncher, Ass-Spelunker (that's one I got in trouble for)...<br>
<br>
But when you have a laid back, open-minded homosexual, you find that they have few issues with what people call them. In fact a lot expect to be called these things. Hell, I get called Dyke and Rugmuncher all the time. <br>
<br>
There are even some gays (especially males, and I don't know why) that like the attetion involved with people calling them degoratory terms like faggot and what not...<br>

And I don't know a one homosexual that has a problem with people saying, &quot;That's gay,&quot; when describing something they don't like. Hell, I say that all the time. <br>
<br>
In fact, this thread is Hella-Gay...    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The whole birth of the word &quot;nigger&quot; actually originated in black slave communitites, pre-civil war. It was a word they called themselves and used with their friends. But then when some white person somewhere used it in a derogatory manner, the derogatory meaning is what stuck for several decades. Now its seems to be evolving back to its original meaning of &quot;a close friend&quot;, &quot;pal&quot; etc.....  Who says the study of words is boring?  <br>
<br>
<br>
most fascinating class I ever took and makes you laugh at people getting bent out of shape over a word. Most everyday words we use are so totally changed from what they orignially meant anyways. I say get mad over intent, not semantics. And dont ever get into one of these discussions with a lingustics professor. They'll leave you wondering what the word &quot;water&quot; REALLY means. ; )<br>

Its stupid. Black people can call each other &quot;niggers&quot; and homosexuals can call each other damn near anything but if someone not in their click calls them that its a problem.  Thats about as hypocritical as anything I've ever heard.  Also, is it just me or is affirmative action the most racist thing our government has ever passed?  Its ok for black people to just hire blacks, as long as they have some women, but its not ok for white people to hire whites? I know if I got a job based solely on my skin color I wouldn't feel very good about myself. 99% of the people in this country don't give a damn about your race, as long as you do the job and don't cause problems. Half the racism complaints in the country are the result of people who do their work halfass getting fired then playing the race card. It makes it hard on people who run businesses, and it makes it hard on people with legitimate complaints. I know a lot of my black friends are completely against AA, what does everyone else think? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukiearagladewalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kieara Gladewalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/10/01 9:59:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Necks</span><hr size=1> Affirmative Action was necessary when it first was made because at the time many of the White buisness owners did not want to hire Blacks.

As long as the media, organizations, schools...etc teach children their is a difference between the races racism will always exist.<br>

Did one of them tell you that putting a word in quotes makes it less offensive?<br>

&quot;Yo home slice... you better wave them hands in the air and make quote signs when you says nigger, or we gonna think its you who is the rascist.&quot;<br>

THERE IS nothing to DEFEND!  skin color is SKIN COLOR!!  It doesn't determine WHO YOU are!<br>
<br>
Wow...I'm just amazed at the immaturity of a lot of these posts.  YES, everyone is prejudice... EVERYONE (about people, cars, food, living areas, etc...)  <br>
<br>
U who cry the US is SO racist... GROW UP!<br>
U who cry about REVERSE discrimination... GROW UP!<br>

Stop defending your SKIN COLOR!  Grow up!  We're all people... HUMAN beings...<br>
