If you don't tip, I don't see how that's rude. You're paying more then enough for a pizza, and the driver is already getting paid to bring it to your house. So the way I tip for a pizza, is, you get whatever the hell is left over.<br>
<br>
If my order is 17 bucks, and I have a 20, congratulations. If it's 14.89 and I have a ten and a five, better luck next time.<br>
<br>
It's all about time management, guys.. I don't wanna stand around and wait for you to hand me change, nor do I want to count out any amount of change.

Dominos actually.  I was an insider.  I hated the fucking drivers who smoked, whined, caused accidents on the road, and telll me to fuck up someones order cuz they only got 1.50 tip.  I never did any of these things.  I didn't get tipped, ever.   I tried to put out a tip jar for the inside crew, those of us not fortunate enough to make 100 bux a night average in non-taxed income, I was almost fired.  90% of the drivers make me wanna puke.  They bitch about not having money, and smoke 3 dollar packs of cigs.  At a pack a day thats about 90 bux a month they DON'T have to spend.  You know what happens when they take too long on the road? Customers call back and complain to me.  Quite frankly, im the reason your pizza even got there in the first place, in one piece,  Generally well made.  The driver on the other hand, with his beaten down vehicle, in desperate need of an impound.  Can make my halfway respectable meal look like a mess.<br>
<br>
Whatever, I did my time in shit jobs.  My advice, order from the fucking window, you can at least see what goes on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulanayalanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanaya Lanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/12/02 2:37:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Fucking Hate You ALL!</span><hr size=1> Here's what I hate:  ordering a pizza, going through the Dunkin Donuts drive through, picking up my grocery order, and being waited on some snotty kid with a chip on his shoulder the size of Gibraltar, who acts like he's doing me a fucking favor by handing me my food.  <br>
<br>
You know the ones I'm talking about:  they sigh a lot, and click their tongues, roll their eyes, and give you that look that says &quot;I'm too good for this place, I hate you and everyone else in this joint, and furthermore, I'm mad at the fucking world because my daddy just told me to get a haircut and my mom made me clean up my room! &quot;<br>
<br>
They can't move to save their lives either.  You see your fucking order sitting on the counter, right behind them, all ready to go, and they slouch over to it at about negative two miles and hour, snatch it up, and then do their slow, swaggering, I-walk-like-I've-got-a-load-in-these-five-sizes-too-big-pants stroll back to you and shove it in your face without checking to make sure the order is even correct.<br>
<br>
As for pizza delivery people, cry me a river.  In high school my boyfriend was a delivery guy, I rode around with him.  You have the best job in the place, you get most of your time to yourself, you're not in the hot kitchen making food, you get to listen to music, call people, and you don't generally get bitched at, unless you're as dumb as a bag of hammers and can't read the receipt well enough to get the person's order correct (in which case you deserve to get bitched at anyway).<br>
<br>
So when you show up with my pizza at my door, you better be neat, clean, have the right shit, and hand it over with a smile on your face.  Give me that stupid kid attitude and you wont even get a thank you, never mind a tip.<br>
<br>
Oh, and yeah, this might not apply to the original poster, but since someone brought it up earlier... How long does it take people to learn that not everyone is looking at you and thinking what a freak you are?  And that if they are, perhaps its for a reason?  If you paint your head purple, don't act fucking surprised when people stare.  Either you want the looks or you don't, just dont be kidding yourselves about it.  I think I learned that lesson at 16 -- if I hate attention, don't call attention to myself.  Yeah, that's a tough one, takes a real genius to figure that out.  Hey, I wonder why all these yuppified suburban shits are staring at me?  Well gee, Einstein perhaps its the 2000 holes in your body, the tight black skirt and heels, and the blue hair?!  Yeah, we were all dipshits as kids, but for some reason it seems to take people a decade longer to figure this shit out these days.<br>

We both posted hypothetical replies to a post. You say in doing so makes me a hypocrite. Would that not make us both hypocrites? <br>
<br>
I think maybe you're missing the fact that my entire first post was a quote directly from Saobo, it wasn't my personal feelings. <p><BR>

<br>
Eladamri was saying that he agreed with Saobo's words, only that Saobo's words could be used to describe him.<br>

<br>
<br>
lets play stupid..K?<br>
<br>
(not right amounts, but were playing here)<br>
minimun wage: $5.00<br>
store fee per delivery: .50<br>
your shift, prime time fri night, 6-11=5 hours.<br>
<br>
ok, we all on the same page? <br>
can we all agree on the least amount of deliveries an hour being 6? we all know they take more than one to their car at a time, lets say 3  per trip, 2 trips per hour. (trust me.. its more than that)<br>
<br>
ok, 6 x's .50 =$3.00<br>
plus wage = $5.00<br>
grand total...$8.00....IF IF everyone stiffed you.<br>
<br>
lets move on, let's say its a bad night, i would say ave tip is $2.00..but with a 0 tip, we will average it to $1.00 per tip...<br>
<br>
ok, 6 deliveries, $6.00 in tips<br>
$8.00 plus $6.00 =$14.00 PER HOUR<br>
<br>
now look back at all the cooks, and the manager, shit, lets include the store manager for fun... are they making $14.00 per hour? NOPE NADA NO WAY IN HELL!!!<br>
<br>
ohh ohh, I forgot, your working a 5 hour shift...<br>
5 x's $14.00 =$70.00 and thats with an ave of $1 per tip.<br>
<br>
K, now I know some days are slower... and your weekends double if not triple that, BUT.. we are doing this for the whining drivers sake...<br>
$70 a day, 5 days a week =$350 a week (half isnt taxed)<br>
$350 a week, 4 weeks in a month, that gives you a grand total of....(drum roll).... $1400....<br>
<br>
Darlin, if your car payment and bills are over that, you are sooooooooo living beyond your means, go get a real job.<br>
<br>
NOW... get back to work and go fold some boxes..thx la~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uknukledustez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Knukle Dustez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/12/02 8:48:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1693.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I Fucking Hate You ALL!</span><hr size=1> Great posts by everyone hehe, managed to waste a little time for me at work. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

All I can say is become a cop, so that YOU can bill the stupid and or rude people, by way of tickets / infringement notices, whatever you guys call them over there. (BTW I hated giving tickets when I was a civvie cop, only people that failed the attitude test got them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I very much agree with the please / thankyou's and paying respect points, they count for a hell of a lot whether it be in RL or this damn game. Far too many people still don't get it; you want help/good service/advice or whatever, take the time to be nice about it, you'll be surprised at the results. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br>

<br>
I make 5.15 an hour. At Dominos, there is no set time when you get off. Usually you work until rush which is between 6-9<br>
pm. If you work until late that means you usually get off between 9-12. And closing is until 1 am. Ok Carol.. lets add this up for you the right way. Now keep in mind I go to college too. I pay for school, my car, insurance, cell phone, gas, rent, groceries. Seeing as how I go to school I can't work too late and can't go into work too early. So lets just say I go in at 5 every night and I got off at rush 9 pm every night ok?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
$5.15 x 4 hours= $ 20.60<br>
<br>
That's what I make just flat rate. Not delivering shit ok?<br>
<br>
Now I probably average about 4 runs every hour. So we need to add $.50 cents for all the runs I took per hour. <br>
<br>
$.50 x 4= $2.00<br>
<br>
Ok so in other words I make $7.15 an hour no tips. That includes the $.50 cent deliver charge for my average of 4 runs an hour. I made more at my last job then 7. 15 an hour. I left it cause I couldn't pay everything so I could get out of the position I'm currently in. <br>
<br>
ok so lets just say I average $1.50  per house. So I work 4 hours right? <br>
<br>
$1.50 x 4 deliveries= $6.00<br>
<br>
Now lets add that together for you:<br>
<br>
$6.00 + $7.15= $13.15 an hour. That is without getting stiffed at all =)<br>
But assuming a normal night. You usually get stiffed atleast once. Unless you're having a good night. <br>
<br>
13.15 x 4 hours= 52.60<br>
<br>
Ok now if you want to get all technical..... I waste my gas for all these people. So lets say I go through half a tank of gas a night. It usually runs me about 15 bucks to fill my tank up. So we'll take away 7.50<br>
<br>
52.60-7.50= 45.10<br>
<br>
So that means if no one stiffs me and I work a 4 hour shift because of gas I average about $11.28 an hour. Now lets refigure out your grand total...<br>
<br>
11.28x 4= 45.12 a night.<br>
<br>
45.12 x 5 days = 225.60 a week<br>
<br>
225.60 x 4 weeks= 902.40<br>
<br>
Now my figures are more realistic then yours. You may or may not have worked for Dominos or whatever. But this is a lot more realistic then 1300 a month. And that's not including the taxes they take out of my checks. I know my pay varies and such, shit sometimes I may make 1300 a month. But we'll do it like this.. Now lets figure up some more shit for you ok?<br>
<br>
Lets say I make even $950.00 a month... I have my bills to pay for..<br>
<br>
car: $246<br>
Insurance:$128<br>
rent: $200<br>
phone:$50<br>
groceries:$150 <br>
<br>
Ok that's all monthly... so add it up<br>
<br>
246<br>
128<br>
200<br>
 50<br>
150<br>
160 ( I'm on a payment plan at school)<br>
______<br>
$934.00<br>
<br>
Wow ain't I rich that leaves me a grant total of 16 bucks a month to do whatever I want with. And that's not even including what the federal and state are going to take out of my checks. But as I said there in no exact amount I'll ever make. Lets even say I clear 1100 a month. That still only leaves me $166 a month. There's technicality for you... and don't even tell me to go find a real job, that's why I'm going to school. And before you get pissed off about a post, remember this is what I do to put me through school, understand that people have different situations they live in. This is mine, so  of course it pisses me off when I get stiffed. <br>
So be kind and tip your drivers.<br>
