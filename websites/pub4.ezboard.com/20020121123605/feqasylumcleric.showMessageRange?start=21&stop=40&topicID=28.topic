I am normally a proponent for need before greed.<br>
After some lengthy discussions with +wis casters who felt slighted<br>
by need before greed in some dungeons, I am now more open<br>
minded to an all roll loot rule.<br>
<br>
The group needs to agree, and live by their decision on loot rules.<br>
<br>
The jade mace would be a need for a tank class, imho.<br>
But that only applies if the group agreed to need b4 greed as the loot rule.<br>
As cleric's you have considerable persuasive abilities to change the group<br>
loot rule.  If they won't change, offer your healing abilities to another group.<br>

I think the issue was whether or not a cleric could claim to need a jade mace, or more generally is need any item you would like to equip or is it whatever items eq convention has decided are an upgrade for your class.  Ex a shaman claiming they need a cloak of shadows in order to proc while soloing (this is rl example).

If it is someone you know and such then I can go along with Need before Greed.  But unfortunately, I would hate to see the weapon up for Auction the next day after the person said they &quot;needed&quot; it.  So the best solution is... It took the group to get the item then everyone in the group should have a chance to roll for the item.  A person can bow out of the roll if they want or even Roll and give the item to the person who they feel deserves it.  I don't think anyone should be excluded from a roll if they want to be in the roll and they contributed to obtaining the item.<br>

I stun when Manna is permitting.<br>
Ocassionally, I throw in a NUKE if I think that that might help the party, and, I can do it without risking any healing manna.<br>

I guess I should blame Verant. Why in god name did they make this, a GREAT Weapon, Cleric Compatable? They should have made it Warrior only, that way, we could not be tempted. (God, a Cleric giving into temptation!)<br>
<br>
Clerics do not have to go get their own stuff? Look at my forrest loops, that I had to hunt in FM for such a long time for, and, every group I was in let EVERYONE roll, because it could be used by every one, and it was such a good money item. I have seen more than one warrior get them before I got mine. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Camdar:<br>
<br>
Sir, you write a very long detailed point-by-point reply. I'm afraid I do not have the time to reply in style, it would tank me hours and I have to leave my workplace soon and head home. I will therefore try to reply to just a few key points. I point out that you have left Worthy's topic way behind though, and have turned this thread into a personal lets-put-this-Felishanna-on-the-spot session (again!).<br>
<br>
First the RP points (these are way off topic, but since you brought them up, I shall reply to them):<br>
<br>
1. There is no universal &quot;How I think a Cleric of Tunare should be played&quot;. Indeed, I would hate it if every Tunarean Cleric played it like I do, I'd play it some other way simply on principle then, I like some variation. But to me its all the same subject - if you don't like *my* roleplay, you don't like it. So be it! I respect you having your own stance. Notice &gt; I do not attack your stance, even if I do actually have some strong feelings on it, but I will not state them as frankly it is none of my business how you play your character. Some others including yourself could learn this lesson about other people's characters, and this might lead to a little less confrontation and a little more tolerance.<br>
<br>
2. You mentioned PvP again, I don't know why. As I have also said before, I dislike PvP, as there is no way of avoiding the jerks who would ruin and interfere with the way I choose to play (eg killing my character every five minutes). Im not attacking PvP, some people love it, but it is not for me. But you can't tell me where I *should* be playing, that would be a *very*arrogant stance for you to take if you held it.<br>
<br>
Now to the matter at hand:<br>
<br>
I mean you no offence whatsoever, but reading your post it came across to me as thinly veiled self-righteous indignation with someone else taking another view from your own. I can do self-righteous indignation myself actually, I'll try also to keep it to a minimum but I'm sure it will be there.<br>
<br>
1. You casually threw aside the main thrust of my entire position. That is my right to determine my own character's aspirations. Perhaps this is because of the circumstances under which you play, sheltered and provided for by one of the most powerful guilds on the server (but maybe I'm off base here). Perhaps it is just your personality, in that you feel that ultimately everyone *should* play the same way and to the same basic principles (but maybe I'm off base here too). I'm reluctant to speculate more because this player doesn't know you the player, and I won't do what so many do and come to some final judgement on the personal motivations of another player I don't even know as a person. But whatever the reason, it is well time that an clearly educated and well spoken person such as yourself finally accepted that others do not all agree with you, and that doesn't make them bad people, or people who must be motivated by greed or some other nasty motive.<br>
<br>
2. Get this &gt; you and every other 'disapprover' &gt; I can and will play as I choose. There is nowhere else to go from that statement really, it should be pretty clear. If this means I want to build a roleplaying battle cleric with what you may deem entirely inappropriate equipment, all I can say is &gt; pay attention to your own characters, not mine.<br>
<br>
3. My personal (and it is just that, personal to me only, unless others choose to adopt it) loot rules for pick-up groups, are a roleplay friendly version of 'Need before Greed', where only those who 'Need' are included in the roll, unless none 'Need', in which case all roll. Your version means &gt; Camdar decides if the character needs it to equip, according to his pre-conceived views. My version means &gt; each group member decides if their character needs it to equip. Yes this involves *trust* that the group members will only say they 'Need' if they are going to equip it, and not if they secretly plan to auction it, twink it, give it to another or trade for loot at the first chance they get. Now I know you will not agree with this policy, but if you expect me to respect your view, than I expect you to respect mine. If not, well, all we can do is agree to disagree. But if you were to start the character assassination stuff (which you very hinted at the edges of, I will give you the benefit of the dout and assume it was due to misuderstanding) by suggesting that my motives here are merely to equip myself with Norrath's best items in this way, well, that would be nothing more than an untrue and basisless slanderous slur.<br>
<br>
Of course, now you have referred the general board here, the bash-the-roleplayer brigade will arrive with all their not-so-polite nastiness, but we will see I guess.<br>
<br>
4. Now the point that if I have not understood wrongly seems to annoy you so much. To put it as you see it &gt; the fact that my choice of who I group with, heal, help, rez, my personal policies on everything and anything, whatever, hurts other players. I know this is your view, and you are in good company, others hold it too. But this is all because you are part of what I elsewhere termed the 'expectation and obligation' lobby. You expect other players to play a certain way and indeed even feel that they are under certain obligations under certain circumstances. Members of this lobby see other characters in terms of what they can and should do for them (they don't see it this way, but this is the way it is), and some of them start to feel hurt and/or angry if those expectations/obligations are not met. I in many cases, mostly but not totally due to roleplaying, do not met these expectations. For example, there are those who feel a cleric MUST rez someone, and if the cleric refuses, interpret that as the cleric hurting them &gt; whereas in fact, they are no worse off than if that cleric had not even been online.<br>
<br>
I have a right to cut my own furrow. This annoys those in the lobby, as they don't like to see independence in this way, but there you go. Am I *really* hurting anyone? No I am not, I am merely going spending my free time having fun in an online roleplaying game. I'm not nasty (OOC) to anyone, and I have every regard for all my fellow gamers, but I won't be told how to roleplay or group or heal or anything else. Ultimately it is each and every other person's right to do the same. And if some of the 'lobby' don't like it, it's really simple &gt; avoid me, I won't harass you or bother you in any way, and I will still be polite and friendly towards you, as long as you remain civil to me. The moment your imposed expectations of how you play *your* cleric are removed from me, you won't find me nearly so annoying, as I will not harass you or tell you what you should do (I never do this).<br>
<br>
5. Wow on topic at last. You might be able to afford a Jade Mace. I certainly can't. If I am in a group that uses the all roll rule (remember, it wasnt even my decision!) and win one, and I am happy about that, well, lucky me. If anyone else wants one (whatever class), I hear the farmers are already selling them in Karnor, as in Worthy's post. These guys obviously won rolls and didnt 'need' in any sense of the word. Will they be bashed, or a word said against them? No, lowly clerics like me who aspire to ONE for personal use are easier targets. We are all greedy scum to be persecuted, but the item farmers, and the liars who claim 'Need' but then sell, nah, they are fine.<br>
<br>
Do I sound tired of this discussion? Well ... perhaps thats because I am.<br>
<br>
I'm so sorry Camdar that someone who in many ways comes across as a nice person cannot see that I am also one who just doesn't look at things like you do.<br>

<br>
Now, personally, I keep multiple stat equipment setups. The two I always keep on me, AC and WIS setup, I use under different circumstances. Of the two, I am undoubtedly in my AC setup at least 95% of my grouping time. I would feel it would be safe to assume that this would be similar to the percent of time spent by a cleric engaing in melee, other than out of boredom.<br>
<br>
Though there are the rare occasions where my group is without a cleric, and relying soley on a druid or shaman for healing is unacceptable. This is the time when I slip on my &quot;nurse's hat&quot; and use my WIS setup.<br>
<br>
Now the situation:<br>
<br>
Camping Efreeti in Sol B, eboots drop. Cleric is wearing quest boots. I am wearing Ro. I am in my AC gear, and would not equip the boots that moment, unlike the cleric.<br>
<br>
Now, I would love a pair of eboots to add to my secondary WIS setup. In the very rare chance that I do equip my WIS gear, it would help tremendously, that entire 5% of my time (if that).<br>
<br>
I would like to meet any cleric who truly would have felt that I needed those boots just as much as him/her. I (and most likely that cleric) would feel that this would be an abuse of the nature of the &quot;need before greed&quot; policy, on my part, even though I would use the boots.<br>
<br>
Applied to the Jade Mace dispute:<br>
<br>
I could not in good thought pretend to believe that a very, very small percentage of my time is more in need of another's almost constant use.<br>
<br>
That is what would happen. Things such as boredom, raising skill, and secondary equip oppsed to another's primary equip are, in my opinion, very lame excuses to bend a policy based almost soley on trust.<br>
<br>
I understand both situations, and have been placed in both ... as I can guess most other people have been as well. I understand that cleric's get shafted in the loot department. I just hope a cleric who thinks they need a Jade Mace as much as a warrior truly understand what &quot;need&quot; is. in my opinion, I don't need the boots as much as the cleric, and the cleric would not need the mace as much as a warrior.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, take care all. <p><hr>

Say I had a personal aspiration to be a librarian and collect exceedingly rare spells I had no use for -- if a group allowed me to roll on one and I won it, who would I be hurting by letting it rot in the bank?<br>
<br>
The answer is every member of that class that knows I have it and is unable to obtain it.  When would they feel resentment?  After camping juggernauts every week for a month without the spell going to them?  Two months?  Three?  Six?<br>
<br>
To know someone has something they have no use for and to be unable to obtain it yourself does cause feelings of resentment.  That is human nature, the fact that it is a game has no bearing.<br>
<br>
It is Felishanna's to do with as she desires.  This is not a judgement but rather an explanation as to why myself and others do things differently, putting aside personal aspirations that do not relate to our primary roles.<br>
<br>
Yes, it does force everyone in a class into the same mold to some extent -- but groups are more effective when everyone can fulfill their primary role to their best ability.<br>

Well if you are up meleeing and not medding..then I guess your not stunning.  From what I have been told, the High Lvl stun also does 200 DD?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's prolly more damage than you could do in melee with your &quot;uber&quot; jade mace.  In addition, keeps the mob from attacking and keeps you from perhaps having to heal for a bit.<br>

Felishanna you ignorant slut...<br>
<br>
How DARE you try to pass your puerile greed off as roleplaying? EQ is not and will never be about roleplaying, the game mechanics and the UI make this clear to anyone with a brain. Your moronic, worthless, and lame approach to justifying getting a jade mace is the stupidest thing I've seen in a long time! Sorry, but let's be honest...you are a greedy loot hog cleric slut who doesn't have the guts to admit she wants all the uber loot, the brains god gave a fly lookin for some place to eat, or the strength of character to refrain from taking the BEST WEAPON IN THE GAME from someone who could actually USE it.<br>
<br>
I can't BELIEVE you would actually think you could use a jade mace, good god do you know ANYTHING about your class you unbelieveably dense moron? YOUR CLASS CAN'T MELEE! Say that 100 times willya? That way it might have a remote chance in hell of sinking through the 10 pounds of stubborn fat surrounding your peanut sized brain. You do not have double attack. You do not do more than 2x weapon damage. You do not critical. HelLO? Norrath to Felishanna...you are supposed to be HEALING those who can dish out the damage. That way you might actually get something called &quot;experience&quot;. If you would actually lower yourself to DO this once in a while instead of thrusting your moronic interpretation of a Tunarian Cleric up everyones ass, I bet people would group you more. They might even stop calling you a jerk in the forums. But hey, you roleplay an asshole quite well, maybe you should stick to that?<br>
<br>
And what is this BS about your crusade against Dark Elves? Is this some thinly veiled disguise for your real life racism? Yeah, your &quot;roleplaying&quot; is an outlet for your racist tendancies...that may go over well in the KKK meetings you go to but that doesn't work here in real life. I can just picture it, you spreading your legs for some guy who screams &quot;white power&quot; cause that turns you on, you racist SLUT! You're just like Hitler, with all of this anti-Dark-Elf propaganda...I'm surprised Verant lets you even play. Maybe YOU are the one posting the pictures of the 2-year-old dark elves to the forums, child pornographer that you are. <br>
<br>
It's so much bullshit too, this idea of not ressing Darkies. What, you are never going to want your corpse summoned? Hello? What, you won't res Erudite necros either? Jeezus, wake the hell up, remove the air gap from between yer ears, and grow some BRAINS! Better yet, crawl under a hole and go back to speaking racial epithets by candlelight in front of the cross...at least you'll be away from EQ and leaving us good people alone. ASSHOLE!<br>

Seriously though, Arios has a good point.<br>

Personally, I dont like people that are 'roleplaying' as a 'battlecleric'. In diablo, this was different. Warriors were the best tanks, right? Wrong. Manashield for sorcerer's was much better.<br>
<br>
But this is different in EQ...clerics are to heal, wizards are to nuke, warriors are to melee. If you dont like this, why dont you start a warrior?<br>

<br>
I and two others were grouped with Worthy in CoM (last week I beleive? maybe a week and a half ago)<br>
<br>
The warrior in the group, just before I arrived, had to zone out TWICE due to Worthy meleeing at less than FM, not healing when needed due to meleeing to 'raise skill', not stunning, not doing much else.  This is what I was told. <br>
<br>
What I personally witnessed:  Constantly bragging about how he could melee better than every other cleric he has met (possibly true, what with all the meleeing he does in lieu of healing/buffing/medding) getting up constantly in the middle of fights to loot, when we were pulling constantly and had already decided as a group to go with the ML scenario.  The group did have to zone out once because he was meleeing and when it came time to heal, he was OOM.<br>
<br>
The group put up with this because we either had Worthy, or no healer at all.  And CoM at 5am isn't exactly teeming with potential people to join the group.<br>
<br>
Now I don't know what weapon he was using at the time, but it was good enough in his eyes to justify meleeing rather than keeping the group in good shape.  I DREAD the day that he gets a jade mace and feels even MORE compelled to melee as part of his vision of being a cleric.<br>
<br>
My apologies if this reads later as worse than I intended it to be. BUT, this has been MY experience, and MY reasoning behind my opinions on this subject.  If a cleric that I might potentially group with is known to me to be a 'battle cleric', more power to them...in any other group but mine.<br>
<br>
Agree or avoid?  Avoid, by all means.<br>
<br>
Here is perhaps a very stretched, but feasible roleplay situation:  A warrior from creation decides that he's going to be the ultimate master of the bow and arrow.  He from day one raises his skill in archery.  In groups, this warrior doesn't taunt/soak damage.  He (or she, but I'm using he simply for the sake of argument here, don't get all huffy =)) instead backs off, letting the others in the group handle the toe to toe mob manipulation, while he plinks arrows into it, doing (relative to other classes that can use archery) decent damage, considering it's a bow.<br>
<br>
Would you EVER IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE group with this warrior ever again, EVER?  When your LIFE depended upon them getting a mob off of you.  When your LIFE depended upon THEM taking the damage as opposed to classes that can do it, but to a lesser degree?  Would you group put your life in this person's hands, ever?  <br>
<br>
But they are roleplaying, they are having fun.  At YOUR expense.  That is the key.  Sure, in theory, a warrior COULD roleplay as 'bowmaster' for their whole lives.  But how far would they really get when their fun comes at the expense of entire groups of people?<br>
<br>
Farfetched?  Perhaps.  But I think I have made my point.<br>
<br>
Roleplay is fun, I roleplay at times, ask anyone who knows me. But NEVER when roleplaying would be at the expense of the people who place their trust in me to do my perceived 'job' in a group.<br>
<br>
I think I have said enough.<br>

I can't speak for Brother Worthy, I don't know him, I just sympathise with his aspiration.<br>

I'll leave it to people who have actually grouped with me regularly to comment on my skill or otherwise as a cleric who sometimes like to 'bash evil', and won't worry about what any who have never grouped with me might predict.<br>
<br>
I liked your post Genma, and I agree with it. The analogy is not perfect (I mean, the librarian role is a bit weird and extreme, even by my standards hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) but it's good enough to illustrate in a very fair manner the point you are making. I guess it's just one minor but significant point that separates us here, and that is the conclusion we draw. I'll illustrate using your example, in a way I hope you agree does nothing to change what you mean by it.<br>
<br>
Let's say you have the MoK spell in your library (and it let's pretend for a moment it hasn't been shafted to the point of uselessness and is still ultra-desirable), which you acquired in a need-before-greed roll in a group with no cleric or one where the cleric already had the spell, so you got an equal roll. Let's then say I'm the only level 56 cleric on the server without it. Let's assume as is the case that you are someone who I have great respect for, and we are acquaintances but we not bosum buddies. Do I feel envious of you after 2,3, or 6 months? Or hurt or angry? No I wouldn't actually. You see, that's me, I don't feel I have a right to push my expectation on you. This is nothing to do with RP, its about personality types. I might try to trade with you, or find a mutual friend to trade with you, but if you refused, I dont feel any right to it. It's my job to get my own or trade with someone who will trade it to me, and I take *personal* responsibility for that, not push it on to you. <br>
<br>
You are very very right though. Many people would feel upset by it. Some would be angry at you and attack you and some would even exclude you. And most in that position you were in might decide to tow the line and give up your precious (to you) library, to meet the expectations of others, for an 'easier life', to fit the same mold as everyone else. But I ask you, does that make it right? Do you not have a simple basic right to play the game as you wish (qualified by EULA, etc)? And you are hurting anyone? I mean really? No you are not, they are hurting themselves with their own expectations, you have done nothing to them.<br>
<br>
I personally say it is not right. If your library makes you happy, do it, and let others deal with their own business! (Yes I know the example is silly, but the point is the same). So, I don't get an 'easier life' and I have to put up with being bashed by people who maintain their expectations, unreasonable or otherwise.<br>
<br>
Note: this is my *personal* view, even some of my best friends do not share it, but unlike some people, don't assume I'm some kind of ass for holding it. Strange world isn't it?<br>
<br>
But as I love to say, in as friendly as possible a way ...<br>
<br>
