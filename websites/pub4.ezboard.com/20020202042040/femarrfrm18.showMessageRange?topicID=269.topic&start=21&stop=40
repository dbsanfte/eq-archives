You raise a good point, I think. Like you said, you believe God speaks directly to his servants. It is that act of speaking which is an event. Hence, for God there would be duration. In other words, Trech, there would be time from God's perspective. Not just from a human perspective. Otherwise, statements such as &quot;God said x to servant y&quot; would not be meaningful. The reason why the statment would not be meaningful is that from God's perspective he would have always said x to servant y, which is absurd if God is timeless. (If God is timeless, living in some eternal &quot;now&quot;, then from his perspective there are no events at all. So he would never think of himself saying anything at all to any servant, since such an act would constitute an event. For that matter, he would not even see himself as &quot;Creator&quot; because from where he stands there always would have been a &quot;Creation&quot;: yet another absurdity.) <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Maybe thats the way it actually is? Absurd to you? Sure youve said as much. But this is where i try to see a bigger picture. Things that are absurd to us as humans may make perfect sense when you are an all powerful being. <br>

<br>
What do you base the above assertion on? How could you possibly know as much?<br>
<br>
See that is another real problem. Many Christians, when faced with paradoxes much like those I presented, lapse into irrationality. Anyone can make anassertion about the nature of God that is baseless. You know, maybe God wears Nikes and eats pizza. Hell, he is God he can do anything! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would argue that if there is a god that he created rational minds to discover the laws of logic. One such rule of logic is that absurd statments are not meaningful. They are incoherent. Again, just saying &quot;Well, maybe absurd to you but meaningful to God&quot; will not do, since you would then be denying that rules of logic have any value outside human experience.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Or maybe creation is one infinite event in and of itself.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ah, no. Events by definition are temporal. They are an interval of time. An &quot;infinite event&quot; is the same as saying &quot;timeless event&quot; which is incoherent.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Maybe creation always did exist and maybe he also did create it. Is it possible? Sure why not, he is God afterall.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, no. Another contradiction. &quot;Creation&quot; is finite, it has duraton. It is a contradiction to say &quot;God created at t1, X, which always existed&quot;.<br>
<br>
The point is, Trech, that if you toss out the law of noncontradiction, or even just rational thinking about these issues then you have nothing at all.<br>
<br>
Sure you can haul off and believe what you want, but without a rational basis your belief is equivalent to someone else's irrational belief in the Boogey Man or Santa Claus. In which case, none of this really matters. God can willy nilly do what so ever he (or she) pleases to do. With God at the helm the world is just some chaotic place where one moment it rains H2O in Seattle and another moment it rains Chickens out of the sky for days, just because he is God and can do as he pleases. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This is no attack, I'm really just interested in some beliefs you have.<br>
<br>
&quot;People get so mad because Christians know where we came from, and where we are going, and why we are here, and because we know the chicken came before the egg.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cenden, I think it's more of some people get 'mad' because some Christians <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>claim</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> they know all of the above, but truely do not know any more than anyone else.<br>
<br>
I don't see how you can honeslty say you &quot;know&quot; that we were created out of thin air from God and think you are more right than evolution.  (which, I hope I'm not mistaken, but from past arguments you deny our evolution and claim the earth is like 10,000 years old etc)<br>
<br>
The fact is you don't know.  I question religion only beacuse evidence such as human evolution, the forminig of the earth and galaxy, hell <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> dinosaurs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, is so profound in some areas, that it completely illogical to say that God created man first, or Jesus rising from the dead etc.  I consider myself a somewhat religious person; but religion thus far has only lead me into the 'correct choice of morals' (for lack of a better term).<br>
<br>
I believe religion is a great tool to teach and give example of correct morals (yes, there is a right and wrong set in my mind), but even then there are some terrible inconsistancies in my mind.<br>
<br>
For example:  <br>
<br>
&quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; <br>
<br>
John 3:16<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
So, God loved the world so much he gave up his son Jesus, who he then revived a few days later and after that went back up to heaven? He sacraficed nothing.  Jesus sacraficed nothing.<br>
<br>
Am I missing something?  Also, I can't recall ever hearing of what happened to Jesus after he rose from the dead... Did he then go back to heaven or live out some life?<br>
<br>
The point being, God did not give up his only Son.<br>
<br>
Secondly, how do you explain dinosaurs?  Do you really deny that they are millions of years old and lived on the Earth before us?<br>
<br>
This is why I don't understand how you say you &quot;know&quot; where we came from and the chicken came before the egg. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 606<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/30/02 1:08:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ulujain.org/albums/album02/aar.thumb.jpg width=90 height=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cendan...</span><hr size=1> Tuan, or anyone else.

What I am really wondering is when this is said &quot;Jesus died for our sins&quot; or &quot;God gave his only Son for us&quot;, they just don't make any sense because Jesus just rose from the dead.

Good responses.<br>
<br>
BTW, by &quot;irrational&quot; I was not meaning &quot;stupid&quot;. Instead I meant &quot;not governed by reason, not coherent with rules of logic&quot;.<br>
<br>
Also, if God creates he has a relationship with that created. The relationship implies duration FOR God; and an interval in time FOR God. This is not human experience and I think that is where you missed my point. Instead, it is true by definition: analytically true.<br>
<br>
The same applies to &quot;timeless Event&quot;. The phrase &quot;timeless event&quot; is not meaningful because it is incoherent by defintion.<br>
<br>
What I have gathered from your posts, Trech, is that you seem to believe that God is not bound by laws of logic or mathematics. For God, &quot;Not Green&quot; can be equally true as it may be false; &quot;2+2&quot; can be equally equaivalent to 4 as 6.<br>
<br>
If that is your faith, then I am not going to attempt to change your mind. I am just pointing out that if there is a God he is bound by laws of logic, math, and nature. Otherwise, nothing at all can be meaningfully said about God. We could say things like &quot;God can create a stone so big he can't lift it&quot; which makes no sense at all, and should make no sense at all to God. We can know that by definition. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

You got it. This is exactly what I am saying. I dont think that the creator is bound by his creation. Through my belief system we have the ability to use things like mathematics and logical reasoning because God created them for us. He, however, is not bound by the limitations of our minds<br>

Anyway...<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Lurikeen, </font color><br>
<br>
I am not aware what God uses to pass time... I don't know that he cares to.  I mean He may in His mind say things like "100 years before creation I..." but then since the year is based on the placement of the universe it is very unlikely that he goes by our time clock.<br>
<br>
He may have some "clock" he goes by but I wouldn't see the point for an eteranl being.  <br>
<br>
Who said there has always been light?  I doubt seriously that God has need for light.  So light was created for us, His creation.<br>
<br>
Okay, I agree that if God spoke it would be a refrence point, and if I said otherwise then I mispoke.  My point is that it doesn't matter.  God created the world without speaking, with a mere thought.  His timeline is the same thing... it just doesn't matter.  As an all knowing entity He remembers them all but infinity is a hard concept for us as humans.  What is a dot on a line that never ends?<br>
<br>
Lurikeen, I don't know if you are playing a game, batiting, or what... but it makes no sense to me.  Just because God has a point of refrence in regard to creation it does not make Him have duration, not limited anyway.  <br>
<br>
In the end we just can't know.  Does time as we know it cease to exist when our universe is gone?  Or even just our earth since the planets all have different length of "years."  Will God someday say "100 years after I destroyed the world....."  I don't know but I doubt it.  The span of this universe is nothing in comparison to infinity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me add this, since I have read the new posts that were written while I was babbling out a response.  <br>
<br>
I am not going into interpretation of what Trech says or you say on the binding of God to math and science.  Let me say what I think.  <br>
<br>
I think that God is all powerful.  I do, however, think he limits himself to human refrence as far as His interaction with humans.  If we read in the Bible that Noah took 2 of each unclean animal and 7 of each clean, it is my firm belief that God will always say 2 when he means 2 and 4 when he means four.  I think God would say that 2+2 = 4 in refrence to human mentality.  What I mean is that "2" is nothing.  2 What?  You can't put a "2" in your pocket and even if you add 2 more... its still only a 4, which you can't put in yout closet.  It is a refrence.  Any refrence COULD have been chosen to describe what "two" does.  "Three" could have been chosen to describe what "two" does.  All that rambling is simply to say that God is bound by laws of mathmatics because otherwise He would only confuse mankind, and I don't think that numbers really have any eternal meaning to God.<br>
<br>
Now, as far as science.  Human scientific law says that energy can neither be created or destroyed.  It just changes form.  God is not limited by that.  If He creates then it is created.  I seriously doubt that it is taken from His power.  I doubt His "light" flickered when He used the power to create our universe.  Every miracle in the Bible defies science, or it wouldn't be a miracle would it?<br>
<br>
Could God create a rock too heavy for Him to lift?  Limited to human understanding that just baffles me, but I am sure to Him... its not even worth a thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am rambling at this point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Tuan,</font color><br>
<br>
Let me try to answer this without getting into the "does God exist" debate that I avoid now.<br>
<br>
Okay, Faith is belief.  It is not "I think."  So if a Christian knows the answers to the "ultimate" questions then he knows.  The answers are available to all in the Bible.<br>
<br>
Lets say you know your parents are your parents.  Lets say that tomorrow someone comes in and proves you wrong.  It does not change the fact that the day before you knew they were your parents.  The alternatice is that we go through life knowing nothing, only thinking maybe.  Do we want to get to the point that every statement is prefixed with "as far as I know?"<br>
<br>
It is possible someone will prove me wrong, and even if no one does, it is possible I will get to heaven and God will tell me I was wrong.  Either way I know what I know.<br>
<br>
You are correct in your memory of my denial of evolution.  Simple things turning complex goes against my logic more than believing (read knowing) there is a God.<br>
<br>
People say the earth is proven to be millions of years old.  First off the inacuracies are as prevelant as the "proven" when it comes to dating.  Besides that is easy explained to someone who believe in God.  If God can create Adam and Eve as full grown humans then surely He can create the world they live in as a mature planet.  Would a baby planet serve the needs of adult humans? dont know.<br>
<br>
I will admit that I don't know where dinosaurs fit in... but I don't have to in the grand scheme of things.  Just because God didn't view them as important enough to mention doesn't mean they didn't exist.  I am curious though, went through a serious dinosaur fascination as a child.<br>
<br>
Okay, don't think I left anything out.  The last thing you asked was about God giving up His Son.  It dies not say He gave Him up forever.  He gave up His Son to humility, to shame, to pain, and to death.  Don't let the fact that He was risen in 3 days negate the fact that He went through something that God/Son of God should have never had to go through.  For ingrates no less.<br>
<br>

Yes there is strong evidence for the theory of evolution but you must remember that the theory relies on the concept of biogenesis, the spontaneous appearance of life.

<br>
Let me clear up a misconception. If what I have been writiting is true it is not proof there is no God. It is proof that if there is a God, he would not be timeless (Eternal). Furthermore, as I stated before my arguments do not hinge upon a particular view of time. Time is a measurable period or condition. An event is a measurable interval in time, such as the moment of Creation (if there was such a moment). We say that something has duration as it persists or continues. Having duration logically entails time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;He may have some &quot;clock&quot; he goes by but I wouldn't see the point for an eteranl being.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My point is that God is not a &quot;eternal being&quot; and we can know this is true by definition. Hence, God has a &quot;Clock&quot; because, if there exists a God he must exist in time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;My point is that it doesn't matter. God created the world without speaking, with a mere thought.

<br>
Infinity, in this case, is the property of being boundless attributed to God, should God exist. Having no boundries is a very straightforward concept; just think of the surface of a sphere, there is no single point on the surface that is the beginning or end point. Saying that God is not bound by time means that he does not persist (or endure) through time. I have pointed out why that view doesn't make sense. The best response has been to throw out rules of logic and mathematics with regard to God. A response I don't think is feasible if one wants to make any rational claims about God, for example.<br>
<br>
Also, it doesn't mater, Cendan, if God spoke or thought. The point was that the act of Creation would mark an interval in time relative to God. In other words, God would have a clock with that interval marked on it. God could say then that he existed at the time, just as we say we exist at specific intervals. What that means, Cendan, is that God would have duration; he would be a creature bound in time.<br>
<br>

<br>
I am not playing a game and see the above paragraph in response to your statement regarding duration.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of what you stated I think the position that God is not &quot;limited&quot; by the laws of nature, logic, mathematics is an irrational view. It is tauntamount to the child's imaginary friend who is ever greater than anything else and can do feats ever greater that are limitless. When asked to show this imaginary friend the child retorts that only those who believe him can &quot;see&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the end there can be no rational discourse with such people because no matter what appeal to logic is made, no matter what empirical evidence it trotted out, the &quot;believer&quot; still has their imaginary friend who can do no wrong and is limitless in their eyes.<br>
<br>
Let me just add belief in a god is a comforting psychological response to deep fears and anxieties over the uncertainties contained in life. I am not here trying to take that comfort away from anyone. Just wanted to assure the believers of that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

A very morbid view of life you have Cendan. I am certain that life will just end. If I am pleasantly surprised with reincarnation, life in hell, life in heaven (because I was Baptist as a young child) or hundreds of other possibilities then so be it. However, for me, life is very much worth living even with an end in site. I wish everyone could enjoy life for what it is today without regard to future.<br>

Um, because all our empirical evidence proves the law of science called the &quot;Conservation of Mass&quot; is fact. There is no corallary for the existence of God. Indeed, there is quite the opposite, it is called Ockham's Razor: the Principle of Parsimony in Scientific explanation.<br>

Cendan, excuse me but that is a load of BS. Just which view of Evolution do you refer to? Many a Christian spouts of as much and doesn't even have a precursory understanding of the general theory of Evolution let alone it's many modern counterparts (Punctuated Equilibrium, Neo-Darwinianism just to name two). So before you start applying &quot;blind faith&quot; to &quot;evolution&quot; you might refresh your memory as to what empiricism is all about: Scientific facts. Now, if you have such facts with regards to the existence of God then by all means present them here. Otherwise drop the entire &quot;blind faith&quot; bull. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Good point Lurikeen. However once you study Ockham's Razor you quickly find out that Ockhams's Razor doesn't tell us to discount theory X in favor of the more parsimonious (did I just make up a word) theory Y but simply theory X should be studied and experimented upon first because it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> usually</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the right answer.<br>

I think Tantrid explained it ok. When you get down to the meat of the theory of creationism vs evolution then both are equally unprovable. Creationism because you cant prove God and evolution because you cant prove biogenesis.   <p>Trech Maggotface<br>

However, Ockham was also clear that we should not add entities into an explanation beyond that which is empirically accessable. Unless theists want to step forward and claim that the existence of God is falsifiable "Creationism" can't even count as a scientific hypothesis let alone theory. <br>
<br>
Also we must becareful not to confuse evolutionary models with biogenesis and to not confuse biogenesis (the view that life arises from life) with abiogenesis (the view that life arises from inorganic material).<br>
<br>
The fact is, Trech, if abiogensis turns out to be true in some form that will go a long ways in support of evolution.<br>
<br>
Biogenesis is used by some as an attempt to disprove the idea of abiogenesis.<br>
<br>
As far as evoulution goes it is a fact (The fossil record is just too clear and abundant to entertain otherwise). There is sufficient physical evidence to prove the general theory of evolution is a fact. What is questionable is whether or not Darwin's model is correct or some other evolutionary model. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

However the fact still remains that only simple proteins (building blocks of life but still not life) can be created from inorganic material, leaving one to accept fossil records but stop short of factualizing evolution.  <p>Trech Maggotface<br>
