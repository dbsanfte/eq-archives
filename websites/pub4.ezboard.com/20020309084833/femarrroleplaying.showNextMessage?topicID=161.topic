I had no recollection of my name, my age, my parentage…. Who was I?  Suddenly I saw a light coming towards me.  I surmised that it must be a lantern, as it swung back and forth as if carried by someone.  Slowly I began to make out a form… male, definitely male.  He appeared to be a warrior, as he wore a full set of brilliant blue armor.  He carried two swords, one on each hip, as if they were a part of him.  He walked easily, as if he had not a care in the world, but as he neared, I could see the weight of duty and responsibility in his face.  His face was lined, but not with age, rather with battle scars and worry.  He appeared one who knew his duty well and loved it, yet also who considered it a burden that he might never be rid of.<br><br>“Vendui” he said to me.  “What means that?” I asked.  He explained that it was a greeting of his people, one used exclusively to those he considered friends.  “Why do you say this to me then?” I inquired.  “Any of the Drow are greeted as such” he said.  <br><br>At this I looked down at myself.  “Drow?” I thought.  I looked up at him and asked, “who am I?”.  At this he seemed to become confused.  “You know not who you are?” he inquired.  “Ney” I said.  “I fear I have lost all recollection of my past..” At this I looked at the ground, feeling ashamed.  I knew not why, but I felt as if I was less of a person because of my inability to remember who I was.<br><br>Reaching out, he tilted up my chin.  “Child” he said, “be not ashamed for I have come to make you one of us.”  At this I could only stare.  “One of who and why?  You know not who I am..” I said.  “I have felt the calling of a Sister  of the Shadow, you are that Sister.  You were meant be be one of us, The Cimmerii, The People of Shadow.  I have been sent by Innoruuk, God of all that is Hated, to bring you to your rightful place within The Cimmerii.  I am told that I am to be your mentor, your friend, and your confidant.  I am to help you remember who you are and to teach you the ways of the Indigo Brotherhood.”<br><br>He looked at me and said quietly.. &quot;do you remember anything?&quot;  I looked at the ground, trying<br>to come up with an answer. &quot;Lith....Lithi...Lithiano Kia'ahna&quot; I said quietly.  Looking shocked<br>I gasped.  &quot;That's my name!!&quot; I said.  I can't believe it, I remember.  He continued to watch<br>me, waiting for my next response.  &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said, &quot;that's all I can remember..&quot; Looking<br>distraught I waited for the axe to fall.  I was not good enough for the group and knew it.<br>&quot;Well Lady Lithiano, welcome to the Brotherhood of the Cimmerii, I hope that you will be happy<br>with us.  I have but one request..&quot;  As I looked up into his face I knew that it was to be a<br>request of monumental proportions, I had to make the right decision here or I would no longer<br>be one of the People of Shadow.  &quot;You must swear fealty to The Cimmerii, once you are a<br>Brother, you are not to join any other organization without express permission of the Cimmerii.<br>You will not be anything but Cimmerii. This I ask as Leader and Commander of The Cimmerii.&quot;<br>Saluting him crisply I said &quot;Sir, I am Cimmerii, till the day I leave this plane of existence,<br>and beyond.”  He nodded at me and smiled slightly, “I know not if this is true for you, but many of us felt a calling to join with this guild.  You may not have a recollection of such an event, however we have not had a single member who has not felt it.   We come to the Cimmerii because we feel we belong with them, that is the way it has always been.   I hope that you feel that pull one day, tis quite something to behold.. Once you are fullblood, I am sure you will feel this attachment.”<br><br>I kneeled down before him, saying “sir, I am yours to command, what do you wish of me?”  He looked don at me. “Rise Lady Lithiano,” he said “you are now an initiate of The Cimmerii, we bow to no one.  However, you must prove yourself worth to those who came before you.  Whey you have, you will truly be one of us.”  “Thank you,” I said, “I am honored.  What shall I do first?”<br><br>“You will fulfill your initiate requirement by adventuring with my soul-brother.  He goes by the name of Ashrad and is a Cleric of Innoruuk.  He is a loyal Brother of The Cimmerii and hopes soon to also gain full status among us.  I believe that you two shall make a fine match.”<br><br>“Aye Commander, as you wish,” I said “however, I have but one question…”  I looked up at him, wondering if he would allow me to ask it.  If he was anything, he was formidable and extremely intimidating, as I stood there, I wondered how many others had gone before me and stood in this spot waiting for an answer from him.  “Speak Lady Lithiano,” he said, “as your mentor and leader, I am bound to be at your service, what is it you wish to know?”<br><br>“Sir” I said quietly “You know all that I remember about myself, my name, yet I do not know yours… might I ask what it is?”  “That you may” he said “tis Commander Aedeb Ka’Leem. “  “Thank you for your patience and kindness to me Commander, I hope that some day I can make you proud.  I shall do all that is in my power to uphold that that is Cimmerii.”<br><br>At this he nodded slightly and pointed behind me.  “It is time to go M’lady, we have much work to do.  Your Brother Ashrad awaits you.”  “Aye sir” I said.  Turning slightly he strode off in the direction he had indicated.  I followed respectfully behind. “You have much to learn,” he said “tis now time to begin.”<br> <p>Lithiano Kia'ahna<BR> Commander of The Cimmerii<BR>23rd Season Warrior<BR> Member of SIN<BR>Member of The Council of Guilds</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvermiis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vermiis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.12move.nl/~sh790067/Blek.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/5/02 10:22:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How I became, Cimmerii...</span><hr size=1> http://thecimmerii.cjb.net <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=119.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=119.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=119.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br><br><center><font face="Verdana" size="2">Entertaining the Erollisi Marr community since 12/16/99!</font></center><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
