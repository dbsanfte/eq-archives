 &quot;Lurikeen, while I was reading your post I felt so sad for you. And I htink its great how you feel about life(a bit depressing though- I picture you loving people and spreading joy but stabbing yourself in the heart at the sametime)&quot;<br>
<br>
  That wasn't BS <br>
 ____________________________________________________ <br>
      I find the idea of a &quot;fallen nature&quot; very interesting from the standpoint of how all of humanity (from a theological point of view) suffers a single condition base upon the alleged actions of two individuals. So god condemed every person from Adam and Eve onward because those two failed to behave? Do you really see that as justice? And, for that matter what does that say of the character of the individual who established the &quot;rule&quot; to begin with? After all, god knew before Adam and Eve were created that they would partake of the forbidden fruit, right? No, the tale told of our so-called fallen nature is just too convenient for the story teller and does not do an adequate job at explaining &quot;evil&quot; in the world and &quot;justice&quot;. <br>
<br>
       Why do we associate truth with pain and/or suffering?  The Bible isn't my expertise but, we have free-will and can choose to drive a hot wire coat hanger in our schlongs if we so choose.  Call it pain if you want.  That recognition of a resulting feeling will be your reality.  However, the pain(feeling) is a result of a choice made which wasn't very thoughtful.  Hence, the answers are in the truth.  The reality of those answers don't always paint a pretty picture(although the picture of someone's face as a result of the 'coat hanger' incident is pretty funny, while the picture of it's insertion is not).  This moron made a choice which had very litle balance of thought and feeling(in its non-perverse form, truth and love)  I'm not a very good writer so I'm not sure if the correlations are clear.  Anyway, the moral of the story is;  Hot wire coat hanger inda pp=truth(not just pain). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  HOWEVER, in order to love someone you must 'truth' them as well.  Call it punishment, discipline if you want. I guess it is, but ultimately it is truth is for one's own good.  Do I feel like God punishes me or disciplines me or 'truths' me?  Yea I do, because I ask for it.  THIS is why so many peps have bad feelings about God and want to punch him in his jock.  Why did your parents make you clean your room, wash behind your ears, not open presents until christmas day, teach you good manners, and/or not drop you in a dumpster when you pissed them off for the first time?  'cause they love you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    When you were a teenager why did you get pissed off all the time when they said, &quot;clean your room before you go out&quot;  or, &quot;stop ass-fucking the neighbors dog&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I spilled the beans again, oops.  Because, while we were establishing our independence we were also taking advantage of the situation(their love, or possibly rebeling against their not loving in which case we were actually becoming self-destructive while thinking we were 'getting back at them'.  ----this is not personal psychology, it is stuff we can all relate to,  please don't take personally----<br>
     About justice, I think I said in this post that I don't believe I or anyone else in this world is better than the worst person who ever lived.  Justice is not a weapon, it is a tool(justice in its pure form)  Its a form of truth.  In our perverse way of thinking, we, as a society have come to understand it as revenge.  Not saying that if someone killed someone I knew that I wouldn't chop his balls off, stuf them in his throat then jam his cok in his nose, 'cause I prob would.<br>
<br>
     About evil, evil is that, of which is unneccasary(I've been battling with the spelling of that damn word since the 4th grade)  By unneccasary I mean in its comparison with love and truth.  For the most part justice(how we have claimed it to be) is evil.  <br>

____________________________________________________     He sure did bro. And I knew my daughter was gonna get her ass busted when purposely threw her dinner on the floor(and she did too, 'cause I told her).  There are other forms of discipline, for example:  giving her looks of guilt, or ignoring her until she would have recognized that she hurt me by doing something that goes against my ideal for her(as I love her and don't want her to suffer)  Certain scenarios require certain forms of mirrored truth.  <br>
      We are like children.  When we reach a certain intellectual maturity we question everthing that we choose to question.  Why did that coat hanger incident hurt me so bad?  I didn't derserve that kind of bullshit.  I'm gonna blowup the factory that made them.  I'm gonna beat someone with a stick and spread the hate until God takes notice(WTC incident is good comparison)  I'm also going to not love myself until God brings his ass down here and says sorry.  Anyway, your a smart cookie Lurikeen.  I don't think I have to give more examples. One other thing.  I recognize and agree with your earlier statement about Lurkaria which says that you empathize and sympathize with his idea of spreading Christianity.  I would like to recognize your open-mindedness.  There aren't many people who have da'kahunas to say soemhting like that after flaming him to a burnt-crisp.  Hehe, I've had my ass toated on these boards too I must admit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 Not much time left so I'll get back with your request of the topic Lurkaria.  <br>

I disagree with the idea of &quot;free will&quot;. As a Determinist I would say certain events and conditions caused the moron to inflict pain upon himself. From my point of view individuals do not even choose pleasurable acts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  For instance, my physical construction may predispose me to enjoy certain tactile sensations you would not enjoy. Further, &quot;desires&quot; to entertain those tactile sensations would only be noticed by me under certain conditions. Most of the time I do not want to eat a chocolate candy bar, but every time I pass them at the grocery store I find myself wanting one. Some individuals are predisposed such that they can't walk by a candy bar display without buying one. My disposition allows me to walk by. I do not choose to walk by, conditions are such that I can walk by without buying one. I think that &quot;free will&quot; is an illusion. Individuals want to believe they are ultimately in control of their present and futures, but they are not. Personally, I gain great comfort understanding that what happens tomorrow is out of my control.<br>
<br>
Given a glimpse of my view above you can see how I might think concerning topics such as &quot;Justice&quot;. You brought up the exploits involved in raising children (I have some experience with that)... one thing I have observed is that children, for the most part, haven't a fucking clue about what it is they are doing! :P They exemplify what I point at above. Their physical &quot;make up&quot; and environment push and pull them to behave certain ways. Punishment and rewards become tools by which we change their environment to elicit desired behaviors. Most of the time children behave a certain way which causes parents to behave a certain way and it just goes back and forth. I will not belabor this further. I think you get the gist of what I am saying.<br>

I think you are alluding to something other than property of omniscience which is attributed to the god of most western theologies. What I think you are pointing to is something more like an &quot;educated guess&quot; that can only come through experience. You might have an educated guess that a child will toss food onto the carpet when given opportunity, but you do not know that the child will, in fact, toss food. The child may never toss food onto the carpet, as far as you know. But the idea of omniscience is that god *knows* event X will occur at t1 before it actually does. Indeed, he knew that the killer of John F. Kennedy would gun down the president before the killer was even born. In a real sense, the killer of JFK had no choice at all but to kill, if god is omniscient! Which brings me to &quot;justice&quot;... it is not at all just to punish one for actions they could not prevent due to god's foreknowledge (omniscience). In the case of the story of Adam and Eve it would not be just to punish all future individuals based upon actions Adam and Eve couldn't help but do. God knows that they will eat the forbidden fruit prior to creating them, yet he creates them and the fruit by which they are tempted! (Makes one wonder if god has &quot;free will&quot;?) Again, this is not like popping out a kid guessing that you will have to punish a misbehavior one day (educated guess). Alledgedly, this is a being that creates knowing full well that he will banish them from his presence shortly there after. So why the fuck would I want to spend an eternity with such a monster should he actually exist? I can unequivocally say that if I had to face that monster I would beg for hell knowing that an eternity out of his presence would truly be bliss. Think about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Knew somehow I'd not get by.  Didn't even read the other posts between you and Brut, I'll let you two have fun with whatever you are arguing atm.<br>
<br>
Btw, yes, you're right, I wasn't being arrogant.  I was, indeed as you guessed, attempting to be helpful.  Which of course is why I added the disclaimers that these were my own conclusions and only one viewpoint.  Obviously, there are theologians and scholars out there that know much more than I.<br>
<br>
And actually, I didn't view your questions as retorical at all.  Those questions are actually HUGE barriers for many many people when looking at Christianity.  They actually are really good questions, and have been asked many times by people.  Many theologians have answered them.  Some people think they did ok, some people don't.  Some people believe anyways, some don't.  You might think they are retorical, but many people don't. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyways, have fun arguing.  And brutus222... just letting you know, you're not really advancing your case much when you call people's mother's names etc.  And I think I really need to say, you're not really advancing God either, but then I am not sure you wish too.  You state over and over that you don't care whether someone believes in God or not, even though you do think it has eternal repurcussions.  That shows a huge lack of love on your part for your fellow man.  I'm glad you have a relationship with God.  If you really love God that much, I'd think you'd want to spread the joy.  If you were concerned about spreading the joy, I think you'd be a bit more loving of your fellow humans.  Don't insult their Mom's.. they see that and they won't listen.<br>
<br>
Obviously I won't revist this thread, as I'm sure to be flamed for that one.  Kinda tired of trolling the boards anyways.  <br>

Sometimes people don't see the result of what they are saying.  The result of his ideals of after life were exemplified by my picture of his mom.  Of course I don't want to hurt his feelings.  And I don't believe I ddi.  I just think I threw a wrench in his 'system' of logic.  When people base their ideals only with recognition of their thoughts, they automatically lose touch with their feelings, which is the MAIN point I have been trying to make in much of my threads.  Feeling is half of who we are and it is being ignored and/or devalued by many people.  Yes, I went a little overboard with his 'mom'.  But owell.  Him saying that my relationship with God is a figment of my imagination is pretty insulting.  What he got was a mirror image of what he said to me.  A few have already suggested as such.  But Xamael was the one with Zero substance.  So, he was the straw thatbroke the camel's back.  Ask Xamael if he likes the thought of his mom with regardsto what i said.  Then ask him about God and/or a higher diety, afterlife ect....    He ignored his feeling until I pissed him off.  Then the dam broke and the valley was flooded with emotion.  LOL.  And BOY did he get pissed off, hehe.  If he loves his mother that much wait till he has kids.  And tell him that stuff is the reality for his kids.  He would prob shoot me through the cpu screen 'cause he doesn't know anything of love till he has his own children.  Thats when someone can really understand what love is and how powerful it is.  And how powerful God's love is for his children.  And how powerful an act of love was for His son, Jesus to die for his Children.  THAT, my friend is some Powerful stuff.  I'm glad Xamael was sticking up for his mom, who he loves.   I'm glad he was pissed at me and nothing he could say would make me angry cause I was happy that he expressed how strongly he loved his mom.

I did not grow up going to church every sunday, treat people with love then come monday treat people like shit.(not that you have or other church goers have)  The things I am expressing to you aren't just facts I have been convinced of believing.  This is stuff I have learned.  Funny how my mother purposely did not put me in catholic school and really didn't teach me anythign of God.  She was forced too much when she was younger and wanted me to be able to make my own choices.  I did.  They are my choices and not a pot of soil I was put in.  I found the soil myself, threw my own experiences.  Nothing against peps that did otherwise.  Some peps might call my comments speculation or ideals, but what I say(for the most part) are FACTS.  I will one day die for this truthly love and lovely truth.  WHICH Xamael will too one day.  When he has children.  He will die for his children as Jesus died for his.  Doesn't matter if others aprove for his way of thinking.  Doens't matter if he dies with his middle finger pointed towards 'heaven'.  It matters that he dies loving his children and sacrificing his life for his children.  That is enough to understand God and how much he loves us.  And doing as Jesus did is more important than what religion you are.  I love Xamael.  I love muzaak, lurikeen and triff.  Even you lukaria <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Believe what is say or not.  Doesn't make a shit to me.  'Cause its true and exercised threw love.  and NOT because I feel the need to convince others of something which will inturn affirm my beliefs for myself.  I know if I die tomorrow I will be partying with God and Jammin' with Jesus.  I will always have freewill.  I will still feel many different feelings and not only happiness.  Life will be exciting and not some kind of farmer ho-down.  Unless you so choose it to be.  We will still be exploring this universe and the next.  Still making new things.  Still playing new sports.  Still writing more books.  Its not gonna be some kind of environment where everyone walks around with perma grin like they are high on coke.  It's gonna be about life and all of the trillions of things aout there to learn about and explore.  For some reason people in general think they know either everyhting or damn near it.  We don't know shit.  There is soo much more to learn and explore.  We are babies in terms of time.  Hehe, i think im spending as much time on this board as I am studying for exams and papers/projects an such.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Pretending to be &quot;faithful&quot; to God so you are guarenteed life in &quot;heaven&quot;?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If a &quot;God&quot; does exist, you can't fool him.  And you can't fool yourself.  Attempting to deceive yourself will get you no where, weather it be in RL or in the afterlife.<br>
-<br>
<br>
As scary as it sounds to hear myself say it, I really don't believe in any afterlife (atleast not any that I have heard or thought of before), they don't make any sense.  I don't think it's that we cannot comprehend what it is, it just is not logical, or even emotionally logical.<br>
<br>
So after we die and go to this wonderful place called &quot;heaven&quot; while people alive on Earth are left to suffer over the loss of a friend or loved one?  In this &quot;heaven&quot; we are seperate from the ones we care most about? Why would anyone call that heaven?<br>
<br>
The normal response seems to be &quot;we will have God to love&quot; or something, well, sorry but that just isn't what I would consider heaven, being taken away from everyone I care about.<br>
<br>
If we are so happy in heaven that would mean that our feelings on this Earth are false, it rips apart everything we currently know about emotions.<br>
<br>
So, who knows what happens to us, but I highly doubt there is any magical place full of happiness.  I don't like saying it, or thinking about it, because it always leads me to the same conclusion. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/29/01 8:37:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://server2048.virtualave.net/neplusultra/images/Links/c_necromancer.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Life after death</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;And actually, I didn't view your questions as retorical at all.

<br>
Lukaria, they ARE rhetorical questions, since I not only meant them to be but also asked them in such a manner. I don't need answers to those questions! I think I have the best answers. I could be wrong... have been before, but for now I feel I am right. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Lukaria it is such remarks that allow me and others to flame you. Don't you see how condescending your snappy little remark is? Might it have occured to you that Brutas and I are actually learning something? Or that we are genuinely sharing our thoughts and feelings? That is the arrogance I have talked about. Lukaria you come off with a false humility to cover up the boiling arrogance beneath the surface. You not only think you are right and have &quot;The Truth&quot; (note the capital &quot;T&quot;) but you believe that all others must bow to YOUR vision of &quot;The Truth&quot;. Oh, sure, you will deny it. I expect as much from the false humility you display. Fact is, Lukaria, you will be happier one day when you realise you are wrong and return to your beliefs with a fresh perspective. You will treat others with respect at that time. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
Brutas, You are correct. However, I used just one example to point out to Lukaria the arrogance that pervades most of her posts. Let me explain a little deeper and I will leave Lukaria out of the following.<br>
<br>
/rant filter off<br>
<br>
It is my experience that most evangelical Christians are utterly convinced that most peopled are doomed to hell and that *they* (and they alone!) have the answers to salvation from that hell. There are no real alternate paths to god for these losers. If you are not &quot;orthodox&quot; you will fry as sure as I am typing this out!<br>
<br>
Furthermore, these same Evangelical Christians like to parade around their beliefs under the guise of love. In reality it is simple pity on their parts. They pity all non-believers, since they haven't experienced &quot;the joy of the Lord&quot;. Like fucking Amyway salesmen they peddle their goods! Ever meet an Amway salesman who didn't love their product? Who didn't think the company was far superior to all others? When they knock at your door they bash your use of Tide detergent because they have the ultimate soap! Evangelical Christians like to do that. If you are an atheist you must be a sad wreck of a person. Hell, Muslims have no joy at all and Buddhists are just empty meditating shells of shit all because they haven't the grace of god and the love of Christ in their lives!<br>
<br>
So the Evangelical Christian, with Bible in one hand, and the &quot;knowledge of Truth&quot; (with a capital T!) in their brains embark upon the world to deliver all us puny empty hearted non-believers from what has to be a muther-fucking painful existence. Nevermind that the world turned for millions of years without Judeo-Christianity in it! Nope, these hounds for the lord have to sniff out the unsaved because they are so commanded by their master and we heathens just have to be delivered from our painful, sin filled, lives!<br>
<br>
So in walks the Christian to a game board who decides to &quot;lovingly&quot; point people to Christ. Fact of the matter is the Christian is just a fucking soap dealer who wants to sell her product! The Christian knows nobody on the game board from Adam and could really care a flying fuck about the denizens of the board as real people. NO! It is all about promotion of a certain view. A way to &quot;score points&quot; for the lord! Sure, they always come off with &quot;I truly want to share my joy of the Lord&quot;. Well fucking good for you! Go pet your dog or cat and tell them bible stories while your at it. Join a god damn seminary and become clergy, but know that most people don't want to buy your product! Most people use a different brand! In short, it is arrogant to think that anyway could give a rats ass enough about YOUR viewpoints on Christianity and life in general to &quot;convert&quot;, Evnagelical Christian!<br>
<br>
It is OK for Evangelicals to share their opinions. Just don't start to sell your fucking product to me when we &quot;chat&quot;! Evangelicals should share their experiences but not fucking solicit with them!<br>
<br>
