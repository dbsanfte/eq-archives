The African Americans are demanding REPARATIONS because their great great grandparents may have been slaves.<br>
<br>
First of all, I want ONE person who claims to be &quot;African American&quot; to say something in African. I thought not. They're black. Ooooooh, now I'm a racist because I called them black. Yeah. Sue me. Welcome to the United States of the Offended.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://african-american-reparation.com/">african-american-reparation.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> states: &quot;Critics of slave reparations as well as those sections of the population ignorant on the subject wonder why so many African-Americans are still talking about reparations?  The slaves were freed 140 years ago—why don’t we just get over it?&quot;<br>
<br>
No @#%$! Why don't we just get the hell over it?! The fact that the Reparation movement even sees this as an option shows that they have subconscous knowledge that what they're doing is wrong. Additionally, this is right at the top of their page. These people know full well they're making complete asses out of themselves, but there's a small chance they could set many many blacks for life financially. Why work when you can get a free ride? This has become the motto not only for a monsterous number of blacks in America, but also for a very large percentage of the white population as well. Nobody wants to earn a dollar anymore...not when they can take it from someone else. Some people call it frivolous. I call it theft.<br>
<br>
Continuing from <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://african-american-reparation.com/:">african-american-reparation.com/:</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> &quot;First of all, without diluting our gratitude to the people of all races who fought for the freedom of the slaves and the rights of their descendants, we must state that the simple fact of eventually being freed from nearly two-and-a-half centuries of bondage just wasn’t enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, you poor underpriveledged black people. 140 years after slavery was abolished you STILL can't get on your feet and learn to be a productive member of society. We all have a past that was undoubtedly affected by the Civil War, be we black, white, pink, or bright green. Some of us have family members that died fighting on the side of the Union to abolish slavery. Others of us have family that died fighting to keep blacks as pets. Regardless of what side your family may have been on, the fact is that the Union won and the slaves were freed. White America stood up and WON, sacrificing many lives, to see that end. They did so alongside black Americans, and for the only time in American history the two primary colors won in unison. Oh wait. That's not enough. They want more. A lot more. Their welfare checks aren't cutting it anymore. My taxes are simply not enough to support them any longer, and it's time to stand up and sue white America.<br>
<br>
But there's more. &quot;Slavery was back-breaking work, torture, rape, forced submission, and fear…that continued for 246 years.  In his proposed legislation on the subject of reparations, Representative John Conyers of Michigan describes some of the iniquities bestowed upon slaves in these words: “…the deprivation of their freedom, exploitation of their labor, and destruction of their culture, language, religion, and families.”  Would just being freed be enough for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Would just being freed be enough for me? No, to be honest it would not be. If I were a slave freed 140 years ago I'd have been out for blood because of the conditions that I'd lived under. As a matter of fact my ancestors were freed from slavery a couple of thousand years ago after about 2 centuries of the same type of element. I'm sure they raised hell. Today I have the chance to make whatever I want of myself based on my own merit, so I'm completely content with the way things are. If there are any living black Americans that were slaves themselves there might be a slight case to help them out. Slavery closed 140 years ago. We're up to seven generations of freedom...more when you count the fact that blacks have an insane teenage pregnancy rate. Nonetheless, it's time to start working on your own homes, not picking pockets of hard-working white America.<br>
<br>
Am I a racist? The simple answer is yes, I am. I see the black population as a problem these days rather than a commited member of the American society. I cast blanket judgement on the whole not because of their color, but because of the overwhelming attitude many of them protray. On an individual basis I am close to a great many black people and I respect many more that have proven themselves as useful humans. When it comes down to it I see white people as just as much a problem. So yes I am a racist. I hate everyone the same though.<br>
<br>
The black leaders are crying out for racism to end, yet the problem grows every day. Why?! Racism is big business. Reverand Jesse (Lovechild) Jackson makes millions spamming his anti-white crap wherever he goes. He and several others are the biggest contributors to racism in this country in a long while. While Mr King spoke out against racism when it was necessary, these individuals are gainging more rights for themselves and their &quot;people&quot; than are bestowed upon the rest of society. It's one thing to be equal. Blacks aren't equal. Right now a black has more opportunity than an equally aged white male, yet nine times out of ten it's the white male that succeeds. No racism is attributed there, it's just that nine times out of ten the white male actually works to accomplish a goal. Black America sees this as racism.<br>
<br>
I'm a racist bastard then. Fine, I have no problem with that. The fact remains though...I'm sick of supporting them now, and I'm growing sicker of it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigota.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Igota</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1166<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/26/02 9:37:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3586.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid @#%$ racist reparation jerkoffs</span><hr size=1> Ignorance is no justification for stupidity.<br>

Any African who was ever a slave, and I say "African" because you are African or you are American - you aren't African-Americans, who wants should receive $100,000 and a free ticket to the African nation of their choice.  They will never be allowed back, since its such torture to live in this nation.<br>
<br>
Its pure greed, has nothing to do with who was a slave but whatever.<br>
<br>
Unlike Tovectris I don't believe this makes me a racist in any way.  An apology?  Tell you what, when the spirit of your ancestor appears to me in the night I will express my sympathy.  I won't appologize because neither I nor anyone alive has a reason to appologize for slavery.  No one alive is deserving of an apology for slavery.<br>
<br>
You want a legitimate complaint?  When is the US government going to appologize to me for rebuilding nations that killed my relatives.<br>

<br>
When I went to college in '96 I needed all the financial help I could get. I was a high School dropout (I was bored there) with utterly amazing SAT scores, which proved that I could really do quite well. On top of that I was a national finalist for high school piano performance and a national winner for high school composition. I took forever and kicked my ass something fierce, but I managed to get a reasonable scholarship which would allow me to go to school. On my first day, in my first class, I met a black drummer from Florida. We got to talking about what kind of hoops we had to jump through to get in, and I found out that all he had to do was apply for a scholarship through a black program. There are no scholarsips that only white people can get, that would be racist. He breezed right through because he was black. The opportunities are already there for most black people, it's just that many of them won't use these opportunities.<br>
<br>
Another example?<br>
<br>
Two years ago I interviewed for a job with a large company. It was for a specialist position in a specific application, and I was the only candidate up for the job with the certification and proven background in the application. Matter of fact there are now only about 30 of us with the training/certification. To say the job was mine was an understatement. The hiring manager and I had pretty much decided on a number and start date before I lunch was over. A week later he called me and quite candidly explained that they had hired another person because they needed a black person in the organization for quota reasons.<br>
<br>
Affirmative action is putting people undeserving of positions in positions they have no right to be in. While I am all for helping would-be college students, I think that making a scholarship &quot;black only&quot; is completely and utterly racist. Giving a person a job based on the color of their skin, regardless of that color, is equally racist. Affirmative action only made it completely legal and legitimate for black people to be as racist as they like and made it a lawsuit-ready matter if a white person is hired over a black, even if they are easily more qualified.<br>
<br>
And now they want the U.S. government to use MY MONEY to pay them for work that relatives they probably only recently realized they had?! There's a reason the government has turned its cheek to talks of reparation for the last decade, and will continue to do from now on...if these people are given one penny it will drive the largest wedge in history into the crack between the races. If the &quot;African Americans&quot; though that racism was bad in the early part of the 20th century, they'll be absolutely horrified at the backlash from the white people of America if the reparation is payed. Right now the only thing they need to be concentrating on is stepping up to the challenge of society and competing fairly in what we have come to believe is a capatalist democracy. They're begging for another free ride, when there are far far too many free rides already in place for them.<br>
<br>
Ugh. Igota, I probably did flood to many judgemental statements, but it's my right to be a judgemental bastard. Hell, the Christians in this country are the most judgemental people of all, and they still believe it's a sin. Regardless, this topic of reparation is about as disgusting as it gets. Until recently I really did not consider myself a really racist person. Since reading more about this I'm finding myself loathing a race not because of the color of their skin, but because they are apparently all a bunch of theives.<br>
<br>
Some interesting reading on the subject.<br>

It would take a monumental effort on someone’s part coupled with hard facts to make me believe that anyone living in this country, today, is still feeling the ramifications of slavery. Everyone is born with a clean slate and an uncharted destiny, what you are and what you will become are entirely under your control. If you rob a liquor store or even collect welfare it’s not because ‘the Man’ kept you down and it sure as sh*t isn't because your great-great-great grandmother was a slave.<br>
<br>
If these people get paid I hope the government has some deep pockets to pay the people who really got f*cked and, as a matter of fact, still are – the American Indians. “Thanks for all your land guys, we’ve allocated you 20 acres to live on in the Nevada dessert, here’s some booze… now leave us alone.”<br>

Asking for reparations for the holocaust is legitimate because everything the Nazi's did at the time was against the standards of humanity at the time.<br>

During the time of slavery in the USA, slavery was still a tolerated practice in some form in most of the world. Only Western Europe and some asian countries had moved beyond this practice. Now this is the hard part for people to understand. Slavery was not wrong. In today's society, slavery is wrong. By the morals and standards of colonial society, it was a fact of life. Fifty years from now people will be appalled that we didn't allow women to take combat positions in our military. Heck, a hundred years from now people may think we were barbaric because we think that homosexuality bears an onus. <br>
<br>
by the year 1800 most african americans were free men living in the cities of the north. Yes they were still not even citizens and they dealt with discrimination at every turn, but they were not slaves. Slavery only existed in the sparsely populated southern states pretty much from the time our country was founded.<br>
<br>
To me, I think that slavery was wrong. I can't imagine ever seeing another human being as property, as a pet or as a tool. But at the time of the practice and in the society it was practiced in, it was acceptable.<br>
<br>
Granted that educated people throughout history have spoken out against slavery in every age, and that in the north where educated people were more common, there was more of a voice against slavery. But the north had an industrial economy, where slave labor had already proved inadequate since factory work, to be profitable, requires honest effort from the workers. Only the simplest tasks can be performed by slave labor, such as planting and harvesting. As soon as you require any thought to go into the work, you need a mind that is capable of thinking, that hasn't been broken by the whip or fear.<br>
<br>
Slavery ended in the USA because the north, having no economic need for slaves, began to understand the inhumanity of slavery as we do today. Ironically, given another five to ten years, the south would have probably developed widespread automation of tasks that previously required slaves and ended slavery at that time anyway.<br>
<br>
You can't hold people of the past accountable to the standards of today. I believe that if slavery were a crime at the time, by the standards of the society of the time, that african americans decended from slaves would have a valid case, but slavery wasn't a crime at the time, and was only just gaining status as inhumane. Had we continued slavery up to the Victorian Era, they might have a case, but as it is, I don't think they do.<br>

In calling someone a racist, it's probably best that you not demonstrate that you are in fact a racist yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The African Americans are demanding <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, they are not.  There is no such thing as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> THE</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> African Americans like all black people think exactly alike.  Although there is an unfortunate tendency toward groupthink that persists to this day (Soul Train's Lady of Soul Award comes to mind), mostly as a result of the real need to band together for defense over the years, not ALL blacks are in favor of reparations.  That is the import of your claim, and it is wrong.<br>
<br>
No, you're not a racist for calling them black.  Both terms are used quite interchangeably within the community, primarily depending upon personal preferences and/or biases.  Now if you'd used either &quot;N&quot; words or &quot;colored,&quot; then you'd be demonstrating bias and bigotry.<br>
<br>
Identifying criticism does not demonstrate that you recognize you are wrong.  You've identified the expected criticism of your post that you are a moron and a racist.  Clearly, you don't agree with that conclusion, despite it's obvious and demonstrable truth.<br>
<br>
No, the free ride mentality is not true of a &quot;monstrous number of blacks.&quot;  That would be the motto of corporate America.  The vast majority of blacks in this country are productive members of society.  Although there is a higher percentage of blacks that are below the poverty line than other races (and consequently on welfare and in prison), every sociological, political and economic study I've seen (and I've seen a lot of them) suggests this is more a function of poverty recreating itself -- just like it did in the Italian and Polish and Irish ghettoes of the late 19th and early 20th Century.<br>
<br>
If you can ever get out of the White Supremacist, Redneck, Backwards Ass locale in which you &quot;live,&quot; you might try reading some history.  Although it's supportive of your arguments that slavery was the only thing holding blacks down and it was abolished 140 years ago, you're wrong.  There have not been seven generations of freedom.  Not being able to vote, having substandard educational opportunities and employment discrimination until less than 40 years ago, is a much more accurate point at which to suggest political-economic freedom.  And even today, there are limits to opportunity.  It takes a lot more than 40 years to stamp out 350 years of subordination and discimination.  [Don't make the assumption that I'm suggesting that we ought to accept quotas or something along those lines, because I'm not.]<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Right now a black has more opportunity than an equally aged white male<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Proof?  Of course you have none.  Your anecdotal evidence is meaningless.  One guy gets a leg up through a scholarship (and if you think there aren't any &quot;white only&quot; scholarships, you really are a fool) and another gets a job, and suddenly there's a conspiracy?  BULL!<br>
<br>
So blacks can't call themselves African-American, but Italian-American, Irish-American, French-Canadien, etc. are okay.  That's pretty stupid, don't you think?  Why can't someone identify their heritage?  I'm Scots-Irish and proud of that.  I'm also proud to be an American - most of the time.  What's wrong with celebrating ones background and traditions?  That's one of the things that makes America great -- its diversity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Caveat:  Reparations are idiotic.  It'd be a tax on people that had nothing to do with the sins of the past - including other minorities and recent immigrants.  The debate is useful in getting blacks more involved in the political process, but ultimately, reparations are foolish at best -- regressive at worst. <p>-- The <select><option>SOB</option><option>Grump</option><option>Bastard</option><option>pwner of Chiteng</option></select> formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uflubman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FlubMan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/27/02 8:53:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3586.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stupid @#%$ racist reparation jerkoffs</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you can ever get out of the White Supremacist, Redneck, Backwards Ass locale in which you &quot;live,&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Proof? Of course you have none. Your anecdotal evidence is meaningless.

Myself, I'm not racist.  I give everyone opportunity to prove themselves a worthwhile human being or a POS.  It's up to them.<br>
<br>
On the &quot;conspiracy&quot;, I wouldn't call it a conspiracy, but it does exist.  It's called affirmative action.  Affirmative action is no longer required by law, HOWEVER, companies without a certain percentage of different races can and are constantly taken to court ( I think it was Victoria's Secret not too long ago).  I also believe they are only qualified for some goverment assistance if they meet a certain quota.  I myself have lost out on two jobs that I was more qualified for, simply because of the color of my skin.  Because I was WHITE.  I see it as racism and descrimination.  To me, if you are more qualified, you should get the job regardless of color, sexual prefrence, etc.  <br>
<br>
On a funny side note, my mother was once hired to work at Martin Marietta (NASA) in New Orleans.  She was hired after they read her resume and did a telephone interview.  When she showed up to work, everyone was VERY surprised.  It seems my mom was hired because they thought she was black based on her name.  Before she had it changed, her first name was Merle.  <br>
<br>
I dont have anything against blacks or any other race.  What I dont understand is how it's fair to pick someone ONLY because of the color as long as they aren't white.  TO me, thats racism too.. pure and simple.<br>

Being from Harvest, Alabama, (check it on Mapquest you'll find it's a few short miles from Pulaski, TN, home of the Klan) it burns me when I read the double standards.

Now I live in San Francisco, a wonderful metropolitan town - a little too PC but it's bearable.

I'm not even talking about white vs race_03.. i'm talking race_x vs race_y.  It's a non-violent sort of racism but it's still just as loud.<br>

I understand the roles of organizations like NAACP.  I think at one time their methods were necessary.  But now they only serve as bastions of racism.  Through their vigilance they maintain the very walls they say they want to tear down.<br>

Being a fellow cajun, I am from Shreveport/Bossier City, LA, I know about Rednecks a little myself. I find the term to be a rascist term.

I've got close friends and/or family in both Carolina's, Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Kentucky.  Any group that espouses any of the &quot;ideas&quot; I describe, wherever they may be located, are part of the problem.<br>

I'm not looking at geography, but culture.  I think there's a huge difference between a Southerner, a Cajun (like Flubman) and a Redneck.

<br>
And I agree that some elements within the civil rights movements have become corrupted.  My mom was a card carrying member of the NAACP in the late 50's and 60's, and I volunteered during a year of school with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.  In the past I had been a big fan of the Rainbow Coalition.<br>
<br>
But no longer.  Now they're mostly extremist in order to keep a power base.  It's sad, but true.  Most race based organizations I've been a part of have become so insular and groupthink focused, that they have marginalized themselves.  The NAACP and SCLC have done some great work.  It's too bad that the modern impression of them is getting smeared with the extremist and racist positions of today.<br>
<br>
<br>
Flub:  I'm not a cajun.  I lived in Metarie (1970-3), but I was born outside Gary, Indiana.  We were the local Yanks that used to annoy our neighbors.  However, we threw the best parties, so our neighbors put up with my mom's rule about the &quot;N&quot; word.  I got a real kick out of it the first time she threw someone out of the house for using it.<br>
