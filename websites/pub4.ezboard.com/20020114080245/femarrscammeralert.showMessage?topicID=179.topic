I was hoping it wouldn't come to this because I don't have anything personal against Redawen.<br>
<br>
The Gem in question is for the Druid epic quest.  I agreed to chain quest the item for Redawen since he had everything else already for that step of the epic.  In trade, he gave me a white dragonscaled cloak.<br>
<br>
After the chain quest failed, he wanted the cloak back.  I would be left with nothing.  There was no way for me to get my gem back.  I logged off and read up on the epic quest. Redawen told me to meet him in Misty Thicket to do the chain quest.  I met him there and we gave the stuff to the WRONG NPC.  We gave the stuff to Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket.  I wasn't there when he petitioned, but if the GM looked at the NPC named Ella Foodcrafter, the gem would have been there.  The GM probably looked at the correct NPC for that step, Foloal Stormforrest in Firiona Vie, and found nothing.<br>
<br>
The Gem I had was the Pulsing Green Stone.  I got the gem in Karnors Castle while about 12 of us were raiding.  I got one of the stones and Deggo got the other.  He can verify if you don't believe me.<br>
<br>
The stone is NO DROP.  It doesn't have a real &quot;money value&quot; to it.  But I have to work at getting another stone now to complete my druid epic.  Do you really think its fair that I lose the stone and then give the item back because Redawen had the wrong NPC?  I just did exactly what he told me to do.  I didn't know who was supposed to get the items until after I logged off and looked it up.  It really is his fault for not checking first.<br>
<br>
I feel bad...very bad that he didn't get to the next step in his epic.  But I don't see why I should have to pay (by losing the stone) for his mistake.  However, I am willing to give Redawen half of what I get by selling the cloak.  You all know, I'm sure, that we entered a fair trade and we both honored our side of the bargain.  I didn't have to offer half to Redawen, but I don't think a game item should cause this much real life strife.<br>
<br>
And a quick note to Redawen... I'm not a scammer.  Never have and never would.  You need to think about what I've lost as well...and I didn't make the mistake.  You should not have posted my name on the scammer board.  I hope you re-think your decision and set this whole thing straight.  If you reversed the roles, and you were the one now holding the cloak but no longer had your stone for the epic, would you want someone to post your name on the scammer board?<br>
<br>

You agreed to a &quot;turn in trade&quot; that is where you would turn in the gem and then give him the cloak no mention of the quest has to be completed because we all know verant's quests are about as reliable as well fill in the blanks.

Redawen is a bit shady anyway.   He refused to let my enchanter roll on some crystal chitin gloves in VL the other day BUT he and his twink rolled on them.  (he was playing both and got two rolls)   I could have cared less about the gloves, but i made a mental note about not grouping with redawen again.  Now i read this and it makes me smile just a bit.  I do not condone scamming by any means but i tend to believe foxxer in this situation.  What goes around comes around Redawen.  <br>

<br>
I dunno what to make of this.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, we have someone with a VS stone, who seems to know who it goes to, however gives the stone to the wrong person anyways.  Or he still has the stone.  We'll never know that one.<br>
<br>
On the other, we have someone who traded a cloak for a stone and wasn't smart enough to FUCKING CHECK THE SPOILER before making this huge mistake.<br>
<br>
Either way, I'm glad I turned down the trade offer, because I want nothing to do with the damn cloak.<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like we're dealing with a few possible things.<br>
<br>
a) a scammer (very bad) and a dolt (bad)<br>
b) a dolt (bad) and a dolt (bad)<br>
or<br>
c) an innocent person (good) and a dolt (bad)<br>
<br>
Know what?  Fuck it.  I don't care.<br>

This is extremely honorable of Foxxer to pay for someone else's mistake imh.<br>
<br>
You certainly are not doing the quest without a spoiler, or you would not have known those items could be chained, and you would have done what Ella foodcrafter told you to do and &quot;seek out one like yourself&quot; then Ask Foloal Stormforest &quot;are you one like myself&quot; and get her response. Then make the trade.<br>
<br>
You risked alot on that one and I do feel bad for you. the Jade reaver is a tough piece to have to redo to get to that point again.<br>
<br>
If your going by a spoiler and risking super rare items and risking the chain questing thing, by all means read and reread your spoiler for each step, check your factions, log what you do, and get responses from the NPCs you trade to to make sure you have the right NPC.<br>
<br>
And now Foxxer wanting to help you even with his name being unrightfully on the scammers board.... ouch...<br>

According to Foxxer's story, he did exactly what the first person wanted, so I'm really sorry the other guy is out a cloak, but the deal was &quot;I'll give you this cloak, if you chain the stone to this guy.&quot;<br>

<br>
second of all, foxxer has provided the full name and location of the correct npc to turn the gem into, yet takes no responsibility for turning it into the wrong npc.  i'm not buying the fact that he just read up on it before making this post.  he said he had to read up on it to complete his epic which he has done already?  so, you got yourself a new VS stone in the matter of a day and did your epic?   that sounds like bs to me.  if you knew the name of the correct npc when u chained for him and let him turn it into the wrong person, then you're a pos.<br>
<br>
oh yah, and i really buy the very conveniently timed LD, right before you were going to turn in the stone for someone else that you need for your own epic.......  and you wonder why redawen or anyone for that matter would call you a scammer, wtf is he supposed to think?  you just screwed him out of a lot of hard work and time.  i hope you feel bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwonng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wonng</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/2/01 8:33:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hrm.  foxxer..</span><hr size=1> I will keep this brief and to the point. I have known Foxxer for many a moon now and I just don't see it happening. He has never once cheated anyone I have met or helped him deal with. And I, as I am sure most of us, have spent my fair share of time in EC tryin to work a deal here or there. No, I don't think he should give the cloak back. And yes, shit happens and we go on. I have been screwed before and I learned from it. I didn't jump on a message board and start talking trash about anyone and I don't plan on it.<br>
Any other questions?<br>

Sure, he might be a bit of a ditz every so often, but to scam someone out of an item like this? naw...that's not Foxxer. Foxxer's the guy who'd be gettin ready to go to fear and he'd be standin outside the portal and really close to it and you'd say &quot;foxx, get back down here&quot; and he'd go forward. O_O he's not a scammer<br>
