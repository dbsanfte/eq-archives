Numerous studies have shown the benefit of reading to a child and playing certain types of music for a child months before it is born."<br>
<br>
Cry smile, recognize the voice of their mother are all animal instincts. Those doesnt require thinking/active use of the brain. Its like a bird open its beak and cry when its hungry, its something all "bird" babys have...also all human babys. Pure instinct that the child wants something..like food or something. Its like birds can sense and hear its mother in 1000 other birds.<br>
Why should U hold ur child just after its borned...its becouse the child just after its birth is trying to record the chemistry of his/her mother. Same thing why the cow is licking its new borned cowbaby. <br>
Playing or reading for ur unborn child is prob good for ur child. But it isnt the reading or music. As far as I know reading or playing music makes U relax and when U relax U start producing numerous of diff chems and stop producing some. If U have 10 moms that reads for there babys and 10 not. The 10 reading will prob have lower stress chems in there blood and becouse the child share blood it will also have less. Those 10 that dont read will prob have higher stress chems in there blood and the child also. I can say with almost 99% chanse that if U run or are training 10moms in same study they will get same thing as reading or better.<br>
<br>
Brain waves is electronic pulses... A child develope his brain realy fast the brain waves that are recorded at that early stage can be thinking but it would seem very wierd becouse a child isnt thinking just after it is borned. Brain waves mostly tell you that the brain is working. Not nessasary that its in use. <p>Tumen Oracle lv 60 GOD<img src="http://www.ernieshouseofwhoopass.com/pictures/instantass.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uprocax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Procax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/25/01 12:25:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion, Religion, Fanatics, You Know, Good Stuff</span><hr size=1> Thats all well and good but again using sentinence as the sole factor excludes segments of the population we consider to be human.

<br>
What is thought?  Unborn infants have been shown to be capable, brain-wave-wise, of reacting to stimuli, and to increased brain activity without stimuli, which in a post-birth human would be construed as a reasoning process.  Unborn infants experience REM sleep and therefore dreams. <br>
<br>
Esto:  I have not accused women who have abortions of being murderers.  Now, if a woman believed that the unborn child she was aborting was a human being, then that could be construed as murder, but for an uninformed woman to abort her unborn child is something potentially akin to skidding on a patch of ice and running into another car, killing the occupant.  If, of course, it can be established that the unborn child at that point is indeed what should be considered a human life.  The person doing the killing did not intend to actually harm a human being. <br>
<br>
I have not yet revealed my personal views as to when I believe that a fetus should be considered a human being.  I have not done so mainly because my desire in this thread is to make people question their paradigms, so I'm presenting several logically arguable positions to mull over.  <br>

Wrong.  A sperm will not eventually develop into a sentience unless an egg is introduced.  A sperm only contains half the genetic material required to form a human being.  An embryo, however, contains all the genetic material required to form a human being, and, barring interruptions or inherent defects, will eventually become a sentient being.<br>

Let's not get into the cloning issue.<br>
<br>
The addition of a food supply does not change the genetic makeup of the zygote, which is really all that the embedding is.  The addition of an egg does change the genetic makeup of the resultant zygote.  If your food supply were completely removed, would that make you any less human?  Previous to starving to death, of course.  If you were on total life support (which is basically the mechanical version of what the mother supplies to a fetus) would you be any less human than you are now?<br>

<br>
Yes, the Dolly method would theoretically result in a human being. But the thing is, it's just another genetically identical cell inside the mother until it develops. It's in no way different from a cheek cell in terms of its makeup. And if it doesn't implant and grow, will be shed just as quickly. What's unique about that cell other than it has the potential to be a separate individual? Nothing. What makes us worry about zygotes but not worry about sperm and eggs? The cloning issue is there because it shows just how arbitrary the decisions people make about what is a human life are. <br>
<br>
If you are saying that a cell that is genetically unique and has the potential to be a person is a life, then so is a cell that's NOT genetically unique. If a cell that's NOT genetically unique but has the potential to be a life is a life, then so is a sperm or an egg before it's fertilized. The cycle of life is just that, a cycle. Any boundary you make is arbitrary. <br>

There are many critical-care instances during which it is necessary to place someone on life support temporarily.  This does not, in my mind, make them anything other than human for the duration.<br>
<br>
Even for people on permanent life support, many prefer to live.  Euthanasia is another interesting topic, one I'd rather not get into here.  Though you would perhaps prefer to be dead, I doubt you would state you were not human for the duration, especially if you were cognitively functional.<br>
<br>
I think you entirely missed the point regarding sperm vs. zygote.  Chimpanzees have a lot of DNA in common with us, a lot more than half in fact, but that doesn't make them human by any stretch.  Again, a sperm only contains half of the genetic material necessary to make a human being.  Adding genetic material makes the resultant product something entirely different.  When the &quot;right circumstances&quot; requires altering the entire genetic makeup of the resultant product, it's quite a stretch to claim that that's no different than adding food.  Adding food merely sustains life.<br>
<br>
I personally value human life and therefore I would much prefer to err on the side of caution when it comes to protecting what may be logically assumed to be human.<br>

I know several adopted people.  None of them has ever said &quot;You know, I grew up wondering who my parents were, and that sucked, and I think I would just rather be dead.&quot;  I suppose I could ask them if you'd like tho.<br>

None of which is actually in the Bible either.  If you've ever actually read the new testament, concepts such as &quot;love one another&quot; and &quot;do unto your neighbor as you would have them do unto you&quot; are the prevalent mindset.<br>
<br>
The problem is that people use religion as an excuse for violence, no matter how peaceful the tenets of the religion are.  The modern-day muslim terrorists are no different from the Christian crusaders and other people who have slaughtered others in the name of some higher power.  Don't confuse the excuse for the religious principle.<br>
