Originally written for Elendril but I thought you all could make use of it. Enjoy.<br><br><br><br>Where: Karnor's Castle<br>Repop time: 29 mins approx.<br><br>I'm going to assume for the sake of this guide that you know how to get to verix's room. If you don't, look up a map, it's in the KC basement, quickest way is through a passage underwater at the back of right moat.<br><br><br>- Situation<br><br>There is a safe spot in the doorway between verix's room and the other room with the two undead below the stairs. This is where you will be sitting 95% of the time. There are no wanderers here, nothing aggros you, and the mobs outside verix's room don't see through ITU. HOWEVER, the mobs inside DO see through ITU, the higher level ones usually.<br><br>There are 5 skeletons in this room, and it isn't very big. If you've ever been to HS, then the room's size is about the size of the entrance platform. A bit smaller actually. There's not a lot of room to wander around and root/dot, so you have to do things a little differently.<br><br>Standing in the doorway, you will see two skeletons along the far wall, and verix or his ph near the small table in the middle of the room. To your far right, in the corner, is another skeleton, and in the back, far right corner of the room is a secret wall, with another skeleton.<br><br>There are only three skeletons you can cast on without aggroing the room: Verix/PH, the one straight ahead of you, and the one in the far right corner.<br><br><br>- Strategy<br><br>You need the following buffs up:<br><br>Shield of the Magi<br>Manaskin<br>Jboots<br><br>You need the following spells memmed:<br><br>Demi Lich<br>Shackle of Spirit<br>Immobilize<br>Vexing Mordinia<br>Screaming Terror<br>Thrall of Bones<br>Harmshield<br>Feign Death<br><br>You will not be root/dotting, it is impossible to do. You cannot single pull mobs in this room, even at 60. Instead, you must use charm.<br><br>My strategy goes as follows, assuming a full room pop with PH:<br><br>Check the far skeleton, and the corner skeleton. There are two types of skeletons that spawn here, decaying prisoners and decaying soldiers. Prisoners make good pets, they con light blue and are usually safe to haste with your velious pants (should you have a pair, I do). Soldiers con dark blue and are NOT safe to haste. Charm will get resisted a lot on these, and often breaks early. <br><br>On the initial break, you want to get rid of the PH first, usually. Charm him, if it lands, send him to attack the far skeletons, perferably a soldier, this will aggro the room. <br><br>DO NOT SIT DOWN, remain standing, or the adds will walk over to you, and you will need to ST them or feign. Let them smack the pet.<br><br>Your objective here is to get the ph killed, once he is dead, feign death and wait for everything to walk back to its spawn point. At this point, there should be 4 skeletons left in the room.<br><br>Wait 5 minutes or so. Check the far skeleton, and the right-corner skeleton. If one is a decaying prisoner, avoid getting it killed if you can. Charm the other skeleton, and send it to suicide versus the rest. When it does, feign again, and wait for the mobs to go back home. The objective here is to setup so that you can keep the decaying prisoner as a permanent charmed pet, feigning death at the end of battles and recharming when a mob pops.<br><br>Wait 5 minutes again.<br><br>You should now have 3 skeletons left in the room, only one of which you can cast on. You may get a resist on charm, if so, the pathing in the room is very bad, and gives you lots of time to feign death before anything hits you.<br><br>At this point you should either have a decaying prisoner or decaying soldier available to charm.<br><br>If it's a prisoner, you can (and will likely need to) haste it so it can kill the dark blue mobs. Charm usually does not break early, so it is safe. If it's a soldier, you need to haste it for a different reason. Charm will likely break before the soldier can kill the other two skeletons, if it is not hasted. Have your feign death ready for if/when the charm breaks. Either way:<br><br>Charm the mob. Send it to attack the others, the skel from the hidden room, and the skel along the far wall will aggro on it. Root them both, then slow them both. Haste your charmed pet. Slow should keep your pet alive easily, and haste will allow it to dispatch ONE of the mobs. As soon as it does this, FEIGN.<br><br>Wait 5 minutes.<br><br>Repeat charm, and send it to attack the last remaining mob. If the last skeleton is the one in the hidden wall, you will need to run into the wall to aggro/target it, though you can cast through it. <br><br>After this mob is dead, run into the doorway (safe spot) and feign. Wait for your pet to walk back to its spawn point, then stand up and med. Congrats, you have broken the verix room. Wait for the repop.<br><br><br>- Notes<br><br>Sitting while your charmed pet is fighting multiple mobs will cause them to run over and smack you. Don't, unless they are rooted.<br><br>Screaming terror will channel through a hasted pet's hits, usually. You can recharm while ST is on, when it wears off, send the pet back to fight. This works best if you keep the other mob rooted and slowed.<br><br>Light blue pets NEED haste, and they need the other mob to be slowed, or they WILL die.<br><br>Bring a stack of peridots, you will be refreshing manaskin often.<br><br>Pathing in the room is such that by running across to the other side with mobs in tow, you can usually land a root before they hit you.<br><br>Feign death can be unreliable. Keep harmshield, screaming terror, and root up.<br><br><br>That's about it. Have fun.<br> <p><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81496">Dolalin</a> Bonewielder<br>Warlock of The Shadow Order<br>Lanys T`Vyl</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unumruk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numruk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md96-jma/eq/canada.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/10/02 2:06:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=552.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/palad/smallskel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to soloing Verix Kylox room in KC</span><hr size=1> Update. Verix spanwed (finally) tonight, here's how to take him down.<br><br>Verix is level 55ish, doubles for 145. He summons and is a shaman.<br><br>Firstly, he has a BIG aggro range and will aggro you in the safe spot as soon as he pops. He is level 55 and summons, so root him and get out of melee range.<br><br>Charm your pet. Haste it, send it to Verix. Keep Verix rooted and he will not summon you, rooted mobs do not summon if they have something to hit.<br><br>You MUST slow him, even while slowed he will rip your charmed pet to shreds, so you have to help your skeleton out. Stack 3 or 4 dots, Pyro Ignite blood and Splurt are good choices. If you have Funeral Pyre, that's great too.<br><br>Verix is a shaman and hastes himself, attempts to slow you/your pet, makes a pet, and dispells. He also sows himself and runs VERY fast, you must snare him. Let me repeat that: SNARE him.<br><br>Given what happened and how unprepared I was for the spawn, I'm elated that I killed him. <br><br>Good luck on your VP key piece. Took me 23 (yes, twenty-three) placeholders before he spawned for me. That's over 10 hours of camping. Like I said... good luck =) <p><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81496">Dolalin</a> Bonewielder<br>Warlock of The Shadow Order<br>Lanys T`Vyl</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/10/02 6:45:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=552.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crocker.com/~denise/amflag.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to soloing Verix Kylox room in KC</span><hr size=1> Or use Dire charm and let your pet solo it =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.showPrevMessage?topicID=552.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.showNextMessage?topicID=552.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=552.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.emailToFriend?topicID=552.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.threadControl?topicID=552.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=552.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=552.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumnecromancer>Necromancer</a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
