They are willing to make the sacrifice that it takes to get their epic and, until you are ready to do the same, you are not as deserving as they are.<br>
<br>
Anyone can time the spawn and that's the problem.  Everyone's on the same timer.  When that timer goes, everyone's scrambling to get their first and it's a big wasted effort, because only one group can win.  You way causes many more problems, because the arguments would get worse.  People arguing over who got their first, who engaged first, who deserves it more, blah, blah, blah.  Camping does away with such arguments.  If Ragefire is camped, then you can take your guild or friends and go do something else.  I hate to break it to you, but your way isn't any easier; in many ways, it's worse.  It promotes more confrontations between guilds and everyone ends up hating everyone else. <p>"I will take love wherever I find it and offer it to everyone who will take it, seek knowledge from those wiser, and teach those who wish to learn from me" - Duane Allman</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uslvrclvr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlvrClvr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/02 2:45:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3486.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire is FFA</span><hr size=1> Nice point, but you get the same thing when you try and &quot;claim camp&quot; on him too... look at the confrontation and fights that is causing.<br>
<br>
Your arguement that you might not get it... yes that is true.. but the same happens for &quot;claiming camp&quot; because never in the history of our server has a &quot;claimed camp&quot; been always respected.  AND if you don't get it my way... at least you didn't waste 5 days sitting there.<br>
<br>
the server respects a FFA mob more than a &quot;claim camp&quot; mob.  You don't have warriors or bards or paladins fighting over their mobs do you? because they all say he is a FFA mob.  there isn't as much confrontation as i see over them as i do w/ RF.... just look at the moaning over this spawn since the change. Hell i don't even see as much confrontation over ANY other mob as i do over this one right now.  so tell me... how can FFA make it worse?<br>
<br>
Your arguement there is null and void because in both scenerio's it is going to happen.<br>
<br>
now.. my point is that  w/ rage a FFA mob, you aren't sitting there for days wasting time. (and yes it is wasting time if you are doing something that doesn't need to be done)  yes you might not get him, yes you might get into a confrontation. both scenerios will cause this... but in a FFA mob situation.. there ARE established rules in place .. already set forth that EVERYONE knows about.<br>

<br>
You cant speak for everyone, not everyone knows the rules that YOU follow, some people only base their actions on the belief that they will be respected and supported by the good people who remain on our server.<br>
<br>
EVERY MOB in this game is FFA according to Verant.  But we as a server have worked together to come up with systems and such, we have not been able to find a system for Ragefire but there is no reason to lose respect and consideration for the other players on our server.  Yes there ARE real people behind the avatars, there are emotions, there are feelings and there are GOOD PEOPLE who will say "yes I may have a right to fvck you over but im too good of a person to do it"<br>

It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.  On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls- as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.

<br>
I don't care if it's a modified version of both or how ever ... but i am not ... nor will i ever be... happy w/ the way you want me to do RF.   It causes needless misery.<br>
<br>
also...ok.. yes .. this is really starting to get to me. None of you know me... i don't think i have played w/ any of you guys before... except for the exeption of you Syldra.... i handed my spot off to you in a ledge group in VL... because i was going to leave in an hour and half... and someone in the group said you were wanting to join.  i think i might have sent you a tell one other time asking if you wanted to take over the group i was in..  but as for the rest of you who seem to think you can make a judge on my moral character... you are out of line.  Words posted in haste and anger  do not define my actions.   and i dare for any one of you to find ANY chara from EQ that has played w/ me and found my morals lacking.<br>
<br>
I have not stated once that i would just say &quot;fvck you&quot; to any cleric.   I HAVE stated that i do not and will not respect someone who tries to &quot;claim camp&quot; on RF.  THAT is a far cry from saying &quot;fvck you&quot;<br>
<br>
The dealings i have had w/ people who have tried to &quot;claim camp&quot; on RF have all been negative.  my guild shows up to kill the mob because we know he's due to spawn soon.. and we get nothing but insults and rudeness.  If all these clerics know when he is going to spawn   why doesn't just one of them say &quot;yes i know he's due to spawn soon.. i have been waiting here since such and such time, please allow me such and such amout of time to get the forces here&quot;   THAT at least tells me they put some effort into his spawn. and THAT i would respect.<br>
<br>
You seem to think that i have no clue as to what it's like to sit there and watch for this dragon.   Well your wrong... i have put in a good 80 hours watching and timing this guy.  Sure it's boring but that is not trouble... there are things to occupy ones time... like talking to friends and playing Gems, sitting there w/ a twink (like i did sometimes) and working on his skills such as forage and bind wounds.  MANY things and THAT is why i don't consider just sitting there work.  THAT is one reason i don't respect someone who does that, just simply sitting there. <br>
<br>
Ghie, you have made me realize that to this cleric that yes there may be a reason for them to sit there... and that i would also take into consideration.<br>
<br>
There are many things one needs to consider.  Like HOW this person decides to claim camp...  not to long ago a cleric decided the camp was hers (she had been  out manouvered many times so far)  and she got a monk friend of hers to train mobs on to any other cleric that wanted to sit there too.  Should i respect that? <p><img src="http://www.nwassociates.com/misc/everquest/PhoenixCrusaders/pc_sigs_here/Annetoinette1.jpg" border="0"><Br>57th Season Templar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucarathosollathir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carathos Ollathir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2014<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/24/02 3:47:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3486.topic&index=74>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire is FFA</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your arguement there is null and void because in both scenerio's it is going to happen<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That is because there are people like you with no respect for the time someone else put into camping the mob.

After sitting for 3 days you cant expect the clerics who have dealt with the occasional threats and constant badgering to be as polite as you would want them to be, you must be able to understand that they're most likely going to assume that you're NOT going to want to compromise and be civil.  If YOU as a cleric start out with being civil and courteous I would expect the same in return, however, that like everything that I have posted is my opinion.<br>

Im not passing judgement on you, Im expressing my opinion of the opinions that you have expressed, it does not change or reflect my views upon you as a player in game until you do something in game to make me think less of you.  Like I said my way is not the right way, its my opinion of how I think each individual cleric can base their decision on if they chose to do so, Im not saying you MUST treat players the way I do or that you cant treat players the way you state you will.  Its a debate, regardless of who you are or how you play Im debating the topic regardless as to who posts their opinion and ideas. <br>
<br>
My argument comes down to one thing, respect, as long as you respect the people you are interacting with when it comes down to this mob or anyone else then what you do is fine.  If it comes down to you being disrespectful, greedy, and devious I will lose respect for you as a player if I am there to see it... until then my views upon you as a player will not be effected.  <br>

<br>
During my 6 day (yes read that again folks) 6 day camp inside Sol B, I finally received my epic.  <br>
<br>
During this time I had no less than three threats that if I went LD for even 5 minutes, someone would move in, if my giant force was not there to clear FG's when the first spawned, that it would be taken, if I dared to log and let someone else play my character that my spawn would be conteted, and that if I did not have a killing force ASSEMBLED AND READY TO KILL within ONE HOUR that RF would be taken with the full support of the guilds of these THREE clerics.  Might I add some were members of the guilds that have posted here.<br>
<br>
So please.<br>
<br>
Do not speak of the prior RF camp as being guarnanteed and totally respected.  It was not. If you went LD or failed to clear FG's you lost your camp.  Period.  If you did not have a force there ready to kill in one hour, some other guild took Rage.  It happened a few times on this server, but not many that I know of.  In fact if you ask me to name when I'll have to dig deep to find it.  Other servers have horror stories.<br>
<br>
This SF camp is no different to most guilds and clerics. <br>
<br>
If a cleric is in the SF zone and has been sitting there for 3 days camping RF, AND is actively gathering forces, helpfully sends a tell to the others gathering saying &quot;hey I am gathering forces, give me one hour please&quot;  I believe most guilds back down.<br>
<br>
However, sitting in SF for 5 days does not guarantee you to a 6 hour gathering of forces.  Gather your forces fine, ask for help, fine, but do not sit there for 5 days, then not be able to get anyone on for 10 hours and complain that you have been ganked.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Claim camp&quot; all you want, scout all you want, but honestly folks.... Ragefire IS an FFA mob, mostly respected FFA, but he is STILL FFA.  <br>
<br>
No amount of arguing will change that unless we set up a rotation or come to some other type of server consensus.<br>
<br>
Please note that I am not condoning Ks'ing etc., nor am I condoning &quot;ganking&quot; a mob.  What I am saying is that if a cleric cannot gather forces to kill the mob within an hour, perhaps that cleric should step away and let those that are ready have the shot, without complaining about who sat there and for how long.  Just a thought.<br>

Why have one more enemy when it is your turn or your friends turn?  The best we can do is spam /feedback, e-mails, etc, suggesting ways RF can be changed.  <br>
<br>
Changing the location back to sol b? No.  I don't think losing sleep is the best way to have fun (VI should really get slapped around by the law for exploiting an addiction and causing health problems).  Maybe make RF triggered and higher level, or make some of the other encounters for the cleric epic a little tougher.<br>
<br>
BTW, there may be items that are better than the epic in terms of stats, but what makes the Cleric Epic so handy is speedy CR time.  So here are your choices:<br>
<br>
1 - Stop arguing, go with how it is now and try and get an epic.<br>
2 - Come up with a plan (and actually ignore those who aren't in the majority), and get your epic.<br>
3 - Try things beyond an online petition and change things, then acquire your epic when things are changed.<br>
4 - Never get your epic and aim for something higher (In which case, actually learn a few tactics and get your hands on some MR2's and MGB's to make up for the effect)<br>
5 - Argue about it some more, getting no where, and making competition for your epic tougher because people start to hate you based on your views and won't think twice about KSing.<br>

Pray tell me, campers, what about the people that can't commit to a 7 day camp due to other responsibilties?<br>

Oh and before you start yakking about how you have responsibilities but can camp RF maybe think that others either have more responsibilities or take their existing ones more seriously.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that anyone who can camp RF has no responsibility or avoids it. I just want you to think why you deem those people that have lots unworthy of getting an epic. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

I think you guys need to quit attacking each other (wether you think your doing it or not) what comes around goes around.  Who you flame etc today may be standing over your body tommorow deciding wether or not to rez that ass from the Emarr board.<br>
<br>
Every person is a different case. I think rather than people coming here professing &quot;If I see it up ill kill it no matter what guild is there etc&quot; is a bad idea, why say it? Why not just do it?<br>
<br>
All your doing is making other people more suspicous about you....and thats something this whole situation can do without.<br>
<br>
I myself zoned into Skyfire and INSTANTLY it began<br>
&quot;RAGE CAMPED&quot;<br>
2 mins later<br>
&quot;Ragefire is CAMPED&quot;<br>
Considering only 4 people were in the zone (2 of which were druids) I guessed this was aimed at me.  I told the cleric I HAVE my epic.....<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you here to camp it for someone else??&quot;<br>
<br>
Um....no....I was just walking through Skyfire on my way to HS like i do every week.....<br>
<br>
IMO the best way to handle Rage is the good old respect camp.  It worked in the past and caused less arguments.<br>
<br>
If you walk over another cleric you just make one (or more) more enemy needlessly.<br>

When he was gone he had other people here in his place, and he usually has at least 1 group of people here with him.<br>
<br>
I was in UP when I logged on, and found out that another guild had moved in with 3 people and sat down at ragefires spawn, so we started calling in reinforcements from the guild.<br>
<br>
there are 4 from their guild, and 13 from ours. we said our cleric has been there since sunday, they said it's FFA and the first to engage it gets it, and made sure to remind us that it doesn';t mean we can fear kite it, or something :P<br>
<br>
I stopped typing here, cause I heard loud footsteps and a dragon roar, and when I looked at my other pc I found that a guardian wurm was on us. a few people died, and the rest of us killed it. right after another guardian wurm moved in and attacked the 4 from the other guild, then they were killed while we were grabbing our corpses to rez our fallen guildies.<br>
<br>
Just one more case where most people think it's an actual camp, but some will just log in late in the week out of the blue and come claim FFA ignoring the fact that someone else has been waiting patiently with little sleep for 5 days hoping he'd pop. Others have been by, and when they found out we were camping him, wished us luck and left us to it. <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br>

Pendragon Society did it. Good for them. Even camped a smaller guild still has a lesser chance, they have lesser rescourses of people covering them when the cleric is not able to play. Kind of a null argument.<br>
<br>
I camped RF for 3-6 days? My ass. There is no way you personally camped anything for that amount of time. You had to have had help, people have to sleep sometime. If you log off to have someone else log you in (which is breaking rules btw) do you really have the right to be more respected that the other cleric in the zone that has been there awake longer? Or do you just pass it on to another guildie cleric and screw the other campers time? <br>
<br>
What if they both log in post patch at RF spawn? Who has a right to it? cleric1 /ooc I have been here 24hours 36min and 27sec. cleric2 /ooc oh yeah? I have been here 24hours 37min and 8sec...get out!<br>
<br>
Sorry but making it a camp just causess too many variables and too many loopholes that some will abuse over others that won't. I am not interested in completely steamrolling someones efforts but it is a competitive mob and you need to have some kind of force there to prove your ready to take it.<br>
<br>
Here is a new option for ya! Make it a PNP mob...you are only allowed to camp it for 2 hours before having to share it and pass it on to another cleric. hahahaha . That is a joke btw, I know this is rants and flames but you can let that one go. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, on Syldra's first post she said something about having balls to camp a mob. I did 9 RFs with the old system putting in an average of 3 days each and 2 times they were back-to-back. And I am sure many have done more. As much as I hated that camp I would take the old system over the new system any day.<br>
<br>
Btw, if you ever saw a human monk in a red tunic with staff in hand named Zardokragefire spawn at RFs old spawn point, that was me. LOL I really can't tell you the number of people I got but everytime I was logging out with tears shooting out of my eyes from laughing to so hard. Btw, before you get too angry, I got my own guilds clerics the worst. Doing back-to-back RFs is so boring I had to do something besides trying to pull Efreeti to RF camp. (I got screeenshots to prove it) (of course I have a few pics of some of the wipeouts it cause too. Boy were people mad)<br>
<br>
See you all later, I am gonna go camp Lodizal and see if I get any of this &quot;respect&quot; from some of the members of other guilds that posted here. *grin*<br>
