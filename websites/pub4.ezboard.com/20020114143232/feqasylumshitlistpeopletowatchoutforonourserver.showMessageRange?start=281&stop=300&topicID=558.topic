For the lacking intellect of loseressence I will explain why i called for a ban for bumping, and no loseressance, you attention whore, it had nothing to do with you save the fact I used your thread to put your thread back to the top of the list.<br>
<br>
The reason I asked for the banning was due to cunloser bumping every shitlist thread thier was, if you look my childish little narcisist you will see this is true.<br>
<br>
For awhile I didnt think we would find another attention whore as childish as you, but it seems we have.  Loseressence you should feel honored, by comparision you have graduated to kindergarden. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A> at: 7/21/01 12:51:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=luminescence>Luminescence</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/21/01 12:14:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

&quot;Loserescence&quot; is spelled Luminescence.<br>

&quot;cunloser&quot; would be Counselor<br>
&quot;thier&quot; is spelled their<br>
&quot;kindagarden&quot; is kindergarten<br>
<br>
Well, that's all for me correcting your stupid ass.  Now time to point out your hypocricy.  You sit here and talk about me &quot;lashing insults&quot; when you are there spitting them all over me?  By setting this horrible example, you make yourself look not only foolish, but also unintelligent.<br>
<br>
Now, to finish off by making you look stupid.  You say that Counselor should be banned for bumping all of the posts?  Why did you take your worthless time to post your lame whines in my thread?  Go to rants and raves for that.<br>

<br>
Touche on kindergarden, or however its spelled.  I dont fancy myself as an english major, and have never made that claim.<br>
<br>
As for all of your other corrections, they are false.  I spell them correctly, now little boy I will explain that those are satyrical comments about your character and those others that dwell in the bottom of the swill with you.<br>
<br>
I gotta give you this, I kinda like flamingwolf.  Funny how you cry when I give you a name, and the only name you can come up with I like.  Again speaks miles of ya me laddy.<br>
<br>
I tell you this, Im no choir boy.  Im a dirty bastard, ready to break an assholes teeth when he crosses my path.  However, you my precious little boy are beyond my touch, so when I view your injustice my only tool to smack your teeth is my words.<br>
<br>
And evidently its working, cause your crying loudly.  Cry on my little girl, and please tell me where it hurts.<br>
<br>
I may not be proper, but ya can trust me.  Im all truth and justice, you are all deciet and betrayal.  Any insult from you is merely a validation of my virtue, so spew forth sewer. <br>
<br>
and for why I bumped this in your thread, I wasnt gonna give cunloser the pleasure of pushing your dispicable actions out of site.  I can understand why you would cry about me bringing you to the top again, but your tears are like a glass of water in the desert to me.<br>
<br>
Cry on sister.<br>

It seems that Lumi will not return the Wurmslayer, and Councelor (spelling?) is enjoying to get a rise out of peeps by creating the &quot;more holy than thou&quot; appearance.<br>
<br>
This has become nothing more than a &quot;flame fest&quot;, and before anymore people loose face, or feel personally attacked by some individuals on this thread, it needs to be locked.  When this thread started it was an SL'able issue, regretablely (spelling?) nothing good has come of it (the item was not returned). The last 3 pages of this tread are not even close to the subject at hand.<br>
FACT: Worthy did the proper procedures before taking this here.<br>
FACT: Lumi DID take the wurmslayer<br>
FACT: Lumi has made no attempt to &quot;regain face&quot; or return the item.<br>
FACT: Other attention whores have come in just to flam and get emotions stirred up.<br>
FACT: Due to some of the responses many people felt personally attacked in this thread.<br>
FACT: The recent posts are nothing close to the original post.<br>
<br>
If peeps want to critique grammer, and other insignificant things just to flame someone, or to just get a rise out of someone, please take it to the rants-and-raves board.<br>
<br>
If I wanted to join Lanys for the first time, and I read this post I'd be scared away by some of the responses.  I just feel that this has gotten too personal and need to be locked.<br>

no, loseresence, it is not lame whines. it is making sure that people do not group with idiots like you, who choose to ruin the gaming experience for others. if i'm not mistaken you were whining for people to stop bothering you in other threads. i dont even know why mods are letting you post here, probably shouldn't though. all you do is troll shitlist posts saying how stupid the shitlist is. if it's so stupid why do you spend all of your childish years here? take counselor's advice, get a life. stop wasting your time. <p>Illegal javascript event tags or url parameters detected.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=luminescence>Luminescence</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(7/21/01 2:09:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

  If this thread doesn't get closed down soon, as Hamdar said, then it's going to continue to be this worthless flamefest, only without purposeful information.  All of the purposeful information has been brought up.  Some of it has been recapped, but not anymore.  Welp, time to flame.<br>
<br>
Flamingwolf--You seem to think you're quite the bad-ass.  You think I'm a little girl crying, and also seem to think that I am hurt by your insults.  Nope.  I am laughing at them, pretty much.  So keep up the good work.  You are a real bitch, though, you know it?  You post on nearly every thread everytime you get on.  You have some kind of disorder that causes you joy to blast people with a group behind you?  Let me tell you, you aren't looking good doing that.  I've never seen you once speak for the defendant.

<br>
There have been people who have been listed here who were victims of false claims, I have posted in thier defense and most of the time those people were exonerated.<br>
<br>
However, when some one is posted here, and they are clearly guilty and they act as pompus as  you I never relent.  Like the wolf, I will chase you to till you can run no longer.  Its good you find it entertaining, cause as you prolong it you allow more people to see what your true spirit is.<br>
<br>
About your name<br>
Loserescence fits the best cause it covers all your character traits.  Losers tend to resort to petty acts to recieve attention, they lie to get ahead cause they are unable to achieve on thier own, they cheat cause reality is too difficult for them, and they try to discredit those stronger than them.<br>
<br>
I have no problem stringing your name through the mud, and if you chose to time and time again display your sub-moral character be my guest.  I will be on your trail, to announce the arrival of your dispicable character.<br>
<br>
One day you may discover that attention gained by merit not crime is far more rewarding.<br>
<br>
As to me being a bad ass<br>
Ive been to hell holes that you would piss your pants even if you just saw them at a distance.  Im not the biggest, the strongest, or the fastest, but I bet Im one of the most vicious.<br>
<br>
As to this thread being closed down, homer your the one keeping it open.  If you stopped bumping it, it would sink out of sight.  Everytime you post, you rekindle the validity of this post, and the fact that you havent changed and have no intention of changing your thieving and decietfull ways.<br>
<br>
You callin me a "bitch"<br>
ha. Comming from a low life like you thats a compliment I guess, inaccurate but still higher than you so technically a compliment.  One day you will learn what it means to be a good man and you will be able to call me that then, but till then since all you know is being a bitch, thief, liar and a coward your vocabulary is pretty limited.<br>

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> okay, first time ever posting to any of these boards....  so please bear with me...<br>
<br>
though this happened a while ago, I fell compelled to express my opinion on a few things. (took me a long time to get through all the posts, and yes I read them all.)<br>
<br>
Luminescence is a con man simple enough.  Not much we can do about that in EQ.<br>
<br>
if I gave you anything and you told me that you would pay for it, and you dont, that's theft.  RL or otherwise dosnt matter theft just the same.  Makes me look foolish (or the cleric in this case for get the name sorry) but I should not lose faith in all of mankind over just a few, though it's hard.  however anger we feel in the &quot;game&quot; should not turn into RL threats, when that happens it's time to step away from the keyboard and relax for a few.<br>
<br>
also, finding spelling/grammer errors in posts and pointing them out is just childish...  Now when someone claims to have a lot more smarts then everyone else I too would feel the need to point out errors.  But as you very well have found out I can not spell myself...  but can you do square roots with nothing more then a pen and paper... or less?  point is people do some things better then others, doesn't make one a better person then someone else.  as a rule I dont like when people brag about how smart they are (I too know big words and thier meanings, just have no idea how they are spelled lol)<br>
<br>
back to the subject at hand.<br>
<br>
Fizz - how can you steal in EQ?<br>
<br>
well, confidance scams are the only way it seems and Luminescence pulled one.  In RL with this evidance and a confession Luminescence would be safely behind bars at this point.  But alas this is not RL this is EQ and the only thing people can do is put it on the SL to warn others.  But, as it has been stated before, a new rep is easy to find, in fact only a few seconds and a couple clicks away, how sad...<br>
<br>
I personaly enjoy RPing, but EQ is not what I would call a RPG.  Even tried the pvp servers for a bit, untill a lvl 4 killed my lvl 2 for no reason cept I had looted cloth sleaves, and get this both pallys who were same race/god... boy now that's roleplaying lol and this is not an isolated occurance.<br>
<br>
I kind of jumped around a lot, and misspelled even more.  also typed more then I had planed on, oh well.<br>
<br>
take care, and perhaps you hear my jiberish again some day.  *grin*<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Fraud in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary action when confirmed by an internal EQCSR. Fraud is defined as falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense. Examples of this activity include but are not limited to offering to drag the corpse of another player to safety but instead hiding it deeper in the dungeon as well as using flaws in a secure trade window to deprive someone of one of their items.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How is this type of thing not covered by the PnP?  I'm a bit confused here.  The example talks about flaws in the trade window, but the rule itself doesn't appear to be limited as such. <p>Ray,<BR>

Do not click trade if everything you agreed on is not in the trade window. Period.<br>
<br>
If you /petition it will go something like this<br>
<br>
You: Some guy just stole my wurmslayer<br>
GM_01: How did he steal it?<br>
You: He told me if I gave it to him, he'd go to his other character and get me the money, so I did.<br>
GM_01: Then he didn't steal it, did he? You GAVE it to him.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's a shitty policy in some ways, but what else are GMs supposed to do? in over 2 years playing this game, I have *never* been stolen from because I will not give something to someone I do not trust, no matter WHAT they promise.<br>
<br>
They say &quot;But I don't need it on the other character with the money! I need it on this character!&quot; *blink blink* Rugen replies &quot;Why is that my problem. I'll give it to the character with money and then you can find someone who trusts your ass to trade it to your alt FOR you.&quot;<br>
<br>
They have told the masses over and over. Do not click trade unless everything is in the trade window. If people still do, they consider it &quot;not their problem&quot;. <p>	<EMBED src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/rugensig.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#FFFFFF

actually thats probably true... if you have played the game before, and arent a newbie(which he isnt), you have some equip to twink up a bit (he does)... and your playin a warrior...first levels are easy 2nd time round...no time wasted memmin spells, just go n bash.<br>
<br>
with all that, im sure he did start another, and we'll never know til/unless he goofz up again. <br>
<br>
just lettin ya know, ive seen so so many fully crafted wurmie holdin trollz n ogrez pass through the swamp, its scary. but the fact is, ill see em hit 20 in the oasis within a few days.<br>
