It is good to see such level of maturity on the board.<br>
<br>
As it is my thing to do, I'll comment on some points:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  From what I've seen over there, and for the most part in arabic culture, women get treated like dog shit.  Rojnaar <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
On what do you base that? how much do you know about the way women are treated? and what are your sources? I can almost guarantee you that 95% of what you know is wrong. You can ask about it here or email me at solathan@hotmail.com . Would be a pleasure to help clarify/correct those believes.<br>
<br>
Another point. People are using Islam as a front for their own goals. This is a bit of a thing from the rules that govern the conduct of wars/battles in Islam:<br>
<br>
-You are ( the warriors ) are to never hurt/hit/harm a woman, a child, a man who is not fighting you or an old man. You're not to burn a tree, kill an animal ( even if you don't have anything to eat, unless you buy it from its owners by their free agreement) and you do not burn/destroy a house-<br>
<br>
Obviously, attacking the WTC with its people who did nothing close to fighting cannot be - in anyway - be attached to Islam or the normal Muslims, just to those who claim it as a front.<br>
<br>
Islam _is_ a religion of peace and friendship, it is just people who wrap the words to suit their political/etc goals.<br>
<br>
Again, whatever point about Islam, its rules, regulations, recommendations, anything that you want to know, please post it here or email me, i'd be happy to clarify. <p>Solathan Honorshield.

<br>
I also think, that many times, you must be VOCAL in order to make it clear where you stand.<br>
<br>
I too know many islamics, but the issue isn't as cut and dry as all that.  For example, THIS is not a &quot;good enough&quot; statement:<br>
<br>
&quot;We feel bad for you, BUT, you have to realize these people are very angry&quot;<br>
<br>
That is the sentiment I have been hearing from MODERATE Islamics.<br>
<br>
Failing to denounce the monsters, helping to rationalize their actions, feeling sympathy if they get their just deserts, will NOT win you friends.<br>
<br>
I am Christian and I have absolutely no understanding of the a$$holes who bomb abortion centers.  I will speak out against them whenever I can; they are criminally deluded and their behavior is inexcusable.<br>
<br>
I don't hear any Islamic groups making those kind of statements about terrorists in general over the years.  Even my Islamic friends have said that, while it is a terrible tragedy, it is really Israel who is to blame! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucryptdsanguis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crypt DSanguis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/12/01 9:44:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hm</span><hr size=1> The Problem I see with Usama Ibn Ladin is, that he used to attack US-Institutions <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> outside</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the US because his declared Goal was to stop US involment in other Parts of the World.

Told?  Told by whom?  By the USA?  By NATO?  By their neighboring countries?  How would you like it if our president got told what to do by some foreign power, just because they were powerful enough to kill him if he didn't?  While I believe people should be able to freely elect their leader, I don't think that leader should have to "do as they are told" by the USA or any other country.  People complain that the USA shouldn't have to be the World's Police, but if we're bossing around foreign leaders, what else are we?<br>

I guess Immaturity had to creep into this thread somewhere, why put the STFU on the end of your sentence? It doesn't enforce your point anymore.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Arrest him for question at the least..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree, but arresting Bin Laden would be a very hard thing to do. Even finding him would be a miracle, they would have that guy so well hidden that he would be next to impossible to find, plus I don't really think the Government over there is going to just allow the US to walk in and take him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Any nation that is hiding him. Bomb them to the fucking ground<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Disagree. More innocent people would be hurt this way. Lets suppose some countries government is hiding Bin Laden, does that mean we bomb it to the ground and make the countries people suffer for the actions of their government?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Stop with all this PC bullshit already. Get to the fucking point already. I don't care who we insult <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's not PC Bullshit, it's common sense, I really think the worse way to handle this would be by bombing countries and going in all guns blazing, hasn't there allready been enough senseless destruction? I certainly don't want to see any more of it. <br>
<br>
Fair enough if Bin Laden is found responsible and demands are made for him to be arrested and given to the US and the goverment that is harbouring him refuses, this might be a time to launch an operation to go get him, but still innocent victims have to be kept to a minimum.<br>

Yup. Maybe next time they wont celebrate.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I really think the worse way to handle this would be by bombing countries and going in all guns blazing, hasn't there allready been enough senseless destruction? I certainly don't want to see any more of it. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Really? I dont. We need to go in with guns drawn. We have been dragging our dicks in the dirt long enough. We wernt the ones who planned this fucked up thing. Innocent people are going to die in this kind of war. You must decide wether its going to be more innocent americans or not. <br>
<br>
We go in there and make our presence felt. The less eager those bastards are going to be to hop in that flight sim next time.<br>

Only the extremists were celebrating, they are a very small percentage of the total population.<br>

<br>
Really? If you think it's okay to go in and kill innocent people, then that means whatever the terrorists just did to the USA is ok in your mind as you want to do exactly the same thing to them. Yes they started it, but retaliating in the same way by killing innocents does not make your cause anymore righteous. What if it was Americans who actually commited this act? Would you then want to go in guns blazing through the city of New York killing innocents to find these people? I think not.<br>

<br>
I agree the USA does need to make its presence felt, so this does not happen again, I just don't know a way to do that without innocents being hurt, then again I am not the President and I guess it's his job to think up the best course of action, well most likely the people behind the President as I believe the President is just a puppet of the military and CIA and always has been.<br>
<br>
Once again, I believe the people that did this, whoever they are, should be made to pay in the worst possible way, I don't want to appear as some bleeding heart as I am not, it's just that I have seen so many innocent people die over the past few days I don't know if I could stomach seeing any more meet the same fate.<br>

The United States also intercepted two phone calls made after Tuesday's terrorist attacks against the Pentagon and New York's World Trade Center, and the conversations were between members of al Qaeda, an organization sponsored by suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. <br>

This next one is very third hand, but local (Australian) TV just said that they'd heard from an Internet news source in Dubai, that bin Laden had been arrested by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

I would.<br>
<br>
If a small faction of extremists gained control of the US government and began a series of domestic purges and international terrorist acts...whose fault is it?<br>
<br>
MINE. Me personally. If I'm still alive, it's my fault. Because I didn't speak out. And when speaking wasn't enough, I didn't fight them. I put my personal safety before that of my own nation, and the world. Maybe I even put my own safety in front of the welfare of the entire species.<br>
<br>
Perhaps 95% of a given country, such as Afghanistan, doesn't support the 5% in control. But there's no excuse for millions of people to be dominated by a handful. No excuse except cowardice.<br>
<br>
And yesterday, that cowardice may well have resulted in the deaths of thousands of MY people.<br>
<br>
If innocents die in the reprisals, I can accept it. It won't please me, but I can deal with it. Sorry man, but if these people won't take responsibility for themselves, I'm willing to do it for them...if for no other reason than to keep it from happening again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukrimnukem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krimnuk EM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/12/01 3:30:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hm</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;Really?

I dont think you understood what I was trying to say. If I were protecting fucking terrorists I would expect to be killed. Anyone who is harboring them is not innocent as far as im concerned.<br>

&gt;&gt;What if it was Americans who actually commited this act&lt;&lt;<br>

I wouldnt be an american. And if an american actually did this to another country I sure the hell would not be hiding him. I would rip his nuts off myself.<br>

Fair enough if Bin Laden is found responsible and demands are made for him to be arrested and given to the US and the goverment that is harbouring him refuses, this might be a time to launch an operation to go get him, but still innocent victims have to be kept to a minimum.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

A friend of mine brought up a good point of what we might do.  Say for instance that we find out Afghanistan did have something to do with this....<br>
<br>
Word goes out to Kabul.  The city will cease to exist in 12 hours.  Civilians have time to evacuate, and 12 hours later, we wipe it off the map.  Sounds like something we would do (not saying that is what we WILL do, just an idea that I found somewhat plausible). <p><B>Setis Dagre</B><BR>
