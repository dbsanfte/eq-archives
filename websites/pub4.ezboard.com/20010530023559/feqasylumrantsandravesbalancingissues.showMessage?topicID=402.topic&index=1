I know I'm a druid, but my husband's a warrior and he usually is the main assist:<br>
<br>
DO NOT HIT ASSIST UNTIL THE PRIMARY ASSIST CALLS IT, DANGIT!!!!<br>
<br>
I have seen way the heck too many mobs rip a chanter a new one because people hit assist too soon.  Unless you have turned your assist off, the first thing you're going to do is hit the mob.<br>
<br>
The primary saying &quot;Hail a_mob_00&quot; is NOT calling assist.  He is taunting.  He will, in general, taunt TWICE.  This will, theoretically, make the mob hate the primary more than it hates the chanter that's been keeping it immobile for the past 5 minutes.  If you just keep laying on the assist button, you will break that mez before the primary has a chance to get its attention.  When the primary says &quot;Assist me on { a_mob_00 }&quot; or whatever cute little message he chooses, THEN and ONLY THEN do you hit your &quot;assist&quot; button.<br>
<br>
The other reason is that the primary is, pretty darn often, also the peeler.  When you peel, you have several things on you.  If any of these hit you, and you just happen to riposte, you will target the mob you riposted, whether that's the mob you wanted or not.  I've seen way too many people get the wrong target due to a riposte.  Pay attention.  If the primary is yelling &quot;Assist me on a black reaver&quot; and your little bar over on the right says &quot;a phantom&quot;, then there's a really good chance that somehow you got on the wrong mob.  <br>
<br>
Third thing:  PAY ATTENTION TO SWITCH CALLS.  Don't walk up, hit assist, and go get a soda.  Some mobs cannot be mezzed.  Some mobs types randomly have mobs that can't be mezzed and the chanter won't know until he or she tries.  At that point, the primary will usually change targets so that the current target can be mezzed.  If you keep hitting the current target, the current target won't be mezzed, and you'll have a naked and very ticked off chanter on your tail.<br>
<br>
Fourth:  Spells that don't do damage don't break mez.  Cool huh.  So people, stop yelling when someone is tashing, slowing, or snaring mobs that are mezzed, because those spells won't break it.  I usually walk around snaring every mezzed mob during the fights, because snare is high aggro and will transfer the aggro to me if the mob comes unmezzed, giving the chanter a few seconds to re-mez while the mob smacks me silly.<br>

You're chewing out people who don't know how to assist and at the same time you're chewing out enchanters for chewing out people who don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> appear</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to know how to assist.  You're a tough one to please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;snicker&gt;<br>
<br>
It's a tough situation for an enchanter cause they see a mob and a player facing off.  So one of 2 things is happening:<br>
1. Someone is taunting the mob for you<br>
2. Someone screwed up assist (far more likely in my experience)<br>
<br>
If #2 is true, casting a mez on that mob will most likely be suicide since it will instantly be woken up and decide to have enchanter for lunch.  So you can either try to mez or yell at the tank.  Tough call, but usually I won't be screaming unless I see:<br>
<br>
big_angry_mob has been mesmerized.<br>
Your Dazzle spell has worn off.<br>
<br>
Maybe let the chanter know at the start of the raid that you will be using non-damaging spells to taunt mobs off them.  Could save a lot of anxiety.<br>

Every chanter I've ever played with has known that my snare isn't going to break mez on the mob.  I've gotten yelled at mostly by melees (who later turned out to be the culprit, actually... they thought that the fact that the mob went after me made me the culprit (snares have VERY high aggro), when in fact they were hitting assist during the taunt round without knowing it would instantly attack.  Though how you can miss that boggles the mind.)<br>
<br>
Now, if I'm going to be doing special case stuff I let the chanter know (my root does damage so it breaks the mez.  When mobs are low MR and we don't have many chanters, my husband often has me break the mez by rooting the mob after he's taunted it twice, as an extra backup step to keeping them from eating the chanter.  We're sitting in the same room so we can react to each other instantaneously, which makes it easy.)  I really wish druids got a non-damage root, would make things so much easier.  If you're going to be using your damage root to help the chanter, you'd better have spell notifications turned on and duck out if the chanter starts to cast, whether you think they're on the mob you're on or not.  My usual tactic, in dire situations when the chanter needs help, is to snare one mob, pull it back away from the group and the chanter with that aggro, and then hit the root button, but if I see a cast message on the chanter I will duck out and try again if the mob I'm on didn't get mezzed.<br>
<br>
Hint to druids... during big pulls like Fear break, it's often a good idea to know who all your enchanters are, and /target cycle through their names healing the ones who are going down hard.  Your nuke isn't going to make that big of a difference, but that little bit more healing that keeps the chanter alive when the chanter's healer just can't mash the button fast enough will make a huge difference, sometimes a big enough to be the difference between whether or not your raiding party survives.  Also know who your clerics are, and if you see a &quot;casting interrupted&quot; message from them, it's often a good idea to /target and see if they need help.<br>

<br>
Please do not try to taunt anything off of me when I'm trying to mez it other than by hitting the taunt button or using some sort of non-mez breaking spell.  If the mob kills me, it's going to be either <br>
<br>
1)  My fault for not being able to mez it<br>
or<br>
2)  Your (General sense, no one specific here) fault for breaking my mez by trying to "help" me.<br>
<br>
I come equipped with a full line of spells to help me do my job, and part of my job includes getting beaten on while trying to mez something.  I can channel through very well.<br>
<br>
I understand a lot of people would love to help, but I'd rather be pissed at myself for not being able to control the situation than be pissed at someone for getting me killed by trying to help.  <br>
<br>
Furthermore, enchanters on raids help each other out, and unless it's a really big pull - if I'm getting beaten on and not getting the mez off, it's a pretty sure bet some other enchanter has noticed this and is working on helping me mez the mob.<br>
<br>
In a non-raid situation, well, there things are different, of course, and as long as you let me know what you're planning on doing beforehand, I won't have a problem with it.<br>
<br>
But as far as raids go, I appreciate the help, really, I do, but unless the puller switches to that particular mob, please don't attempt hitting it or trying to get the taunt off to you in any way that could POSSIBLY break the mez.<br>
<br>
To summarize:<br>
I'm sure every enchanter has his/her own play style, but my opinion is that I'd rather go one-on-one with the mob I'm trying to mez or be backed up by another enchanter or DIE trying to CC it than die because someone accidentally (even with good intentions, which I'm sure are behind almost all "accidental" breaks) broke my mezzed a_very_painful_mob00.</font><P><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig2.jpg><br>

<br>
Run up next to the enchanter and chain-cast chloroblast or your equivalent heal on them.  Chanter's hp goes up which is good, and I have yet to see a case in which more than 2 mobs are still on the chanter after I get 2 chloroblasts off.  You want to be next to the chanter to do this because the chanter will most likely be trying to aoe stun or aoe mezz the mobs to have a little time to get the real mez on them, so you don't want to cast from across the room and break up the grouping.  <br>

As a side note, when a bard is mezzing, any MR debuff WILL break bardic mezz (as bardic mezz has a MR debuff associated with it).

I tend to snare every mob I see, and though snare does not break mez, I have been bitched at for doing it. Well ok, i'll just let you die next time if thats what you want, but I would really prefer the enchanters to stay alive. Enchanters I group with seem to be quite happy about not taking the hits, once they get used to it. I frankly consider everytime a caster gets hit to be a mistake on my part, for though I am usally no the main tank, I am damn well a better tank that a robe wearing caster lol. And I can always get rid of the attention I draw upon me once the main tank gets around to engaging that mob.<br>
<br>
When standing next to a mob, it is pretty easy to see if a tank is attacking or just taunting. With double attack/haste and maybe dual wield, swings come so fast when attacking that it really can't be confused with the occasional riposte. And since a riposte only happens when you're getting swung at, it is unlikely to ever break a mez. As mezzed mobs won't be taking those swings.<br>
<br>
Also, on raids with only one enchanter, rooting is a perfectly viable means of helping out. Yes, ranger root breaks mez, but not if you root one of the mobs that are as yet unmezzed. Works like a charm, and it is in fact quite possible for one person to control up to 3 mobs with the use of root alone (in most cases). And though enchanters are indeed able to channel through alot of hits, most mobs have the ability to bash at the most inconvenient times. I know I sometimes get interrupted even with my lvl 15 root, and hybrids have higher channelling than pure casters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think the reason many enchanters prefer to do their job unaided is, that some people tend to mess up big time and they have trouble telling those from the people who are actually helping. It is a problem, and I can understand that unless you know the person standing next to that mob you are trying to mezz, you can get worried that he's one of the jerks that is about to mess up. So if you're worried I don't mind getting that angry tell, as long as you don't mind me telling you back that I am helping rather than causing trouble. <br>
Because no, I am not going to hit a mezzed mob. No, I am not going to use flame lick to draw it onto me. No, I am not going to root it after you mezz it. No, I am not going to get you killed. But yes, I damn well am going to do my best to keep you alive while you do your job. Because that, is -my- job.<br>

Nice post.  Two wee comments:<br>
<br>
1.  The above also applies ta groups without an enchanter, where someone else (fer instance a cleric <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) is handling crowd-control duties.<br>
<br>
2.  I doubt this is news, but I discovered this neat trick by accident:  if ye want ta assist without breaking mez, especially in close quarters, assist while sitting.  This'll set the target, and ye'll also get an &quot;Auto attack off.&quot; message, so ye can stand and prepare ta melee or cast without aggroing the mob.<br>
<br>
