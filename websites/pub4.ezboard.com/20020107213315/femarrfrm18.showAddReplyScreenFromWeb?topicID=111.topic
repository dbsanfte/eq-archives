I cannot believe what I am seeing with every hour that is passing....nothing excuses this, NOTHING.  There is NO REASON for anyone to do any such act as what is happening on the east coast right now.<br>
<br>
Many people have seen my radical views on the Israeli situation in the middle east...but please, realize this.<br>
<br>
I do NOT agree, nor will I justify ANY of what has happened today.  This is absolutely horrible, and whomever is involved, no matter what ethnicity, needs to be punished horribly for this.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to anyone who may have lost a loved one, and I am sorry to anyone who had to witness such a thing.  Rest in peace all whom have died.<br>
<br>
This terrorist act cannot go unpunished.  I hope those responsible are dealt with accordingly.<br>

I have never wanted anything to happen to this country.  I was born here.  I am American.  I am American as ANYONE else born in this country.<br>

I am as hurt over this as all the other Americans who are witnessing this on television and reading news on the internet at their jobs right now.<br>

Please, do not attack me anymore, that is childish for you to do, especially in a tragedy like this Kannibal.  You should know better then to attack me.<br>

I am not discussing, nor do I wish to discuss the Israeli/Palestinian issue.  Frankly, if in fact it was indeed a middle-eastern party involved in this tragedy, I am concerned about the possible 30-40 thousand people that have now died, and really wish that the United States didn't back ANYONE up.<br>
<br>
If the U.S. backing Israel was the reason these attacks were done, I certainly hope the United States is picky about who to endorse in the future.  It could mean our (the United States) own national security.<br>
<br>
Playing world police will have consequences, I think its time for the U.S. to focus on their own people, and not every other country in the world, including Israel.<br>
<br>
I, as an American, hope that the United States stays out of everyone elses business.  Who knows what types of attacks toward them can occur in the future, from any ethnicity.<br>
<br>
If you, Kannibal, are going to make a generalization to ALL ARABIC descented people, then I think everyone can agree that you have a problem.<br>
<br>
Now can you quit jumping on the Israeli/PLO problem, and read my posts?  This is a tragedy, and should not, nor ever happen.<br>
<br>
Point your anger somewhere else, not toward me and middle eastern people.  I know that a lot of white-Americans, and other ethnic groups will single out Middle Eastern people, and racism will begin because of this.<br>
<br>
I am prepared for any type of racism toward me.  It will happen now more then ever, and you need to step into my shoes to even begin to understand it.  I cannot imagine what some of my Palestinian friends are about to endure in their lives ahead.  Hopefully these innocent people in the United States, of middle eastern descent, won't pay for the terrorist attacks on the east-coast today.  They shouldn't have to pay.<br>

This attack was based soley on a previous administrations ability to do nothing about the threating acts against the united states and pandering and cowtailing to other nations instead of sticking to our doctrine.  We as a nation must band together and back the current administration and decide that we as a nation picked the most able-bodied person to fill the role as commander in chief.<br>
<br>
For those liberals out there I respect your wishes to do and say as you want but only to the point that lives are lost at the fact that you want us to pander to bullies.  I can not imagine what you are thinking, you are trying to blame the US for initiating this act of violence because we support some foreign nation in a cause that seems reasonable.  <br>
<br>
I say kill all the motherfucking shitbag middle east countries that choose to believe we are evil and then let them burn in the firey pit of hell while I roast marshmallows on their fricasied corpses.<br>
<br>
As an act of war on the united states there are no longer &quot;innocent civilians&quot;.  The people of said nation that supported the harboring of this terroist organization or regime are just as guilty for not overthrowing them or disposing of them in some democratic way.  <br>
<br>
So in closing, fuck the country/organization that did this and quit pussy footing around the issue someone must die for retaliation, we are not americans because we are cowards, we are americans because in times of crisis we are called upon to do the dirty work of the world and take the liberal banter that comes with it.<br>
<br>
I for one will be looking forward to seeing these people that commited these acts burn in the firey pits of hell and hope to christ that I get a chance to lay some carnage to the motherfuckers over an eternity of torture. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uqaldaliele666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qaldaliele 666</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/freemana/Graphics/mcpi1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/01 9:47:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kannibal</span><hr size=1> Palestinians dancing in the streets overjoyed at this.

They will be dealt with hopefully swiftly and justly with hopes that they are all eliminated at ALL costs weather it be the complete eradication of a people or country they have chosen to wage war with America and bring their filth across the ocean let them pay in the fires of hell.

Just read the posts on this thread.  Someone said to blow up all the middle eastern countries....<br>
<br>
You endorse this?<br>
<br>
Palestinians dancing in the streets are wrong.<br>
Palestinians living in the United States, who are as upset about this situation as Americans are, are not wrong.<br>
<br>
Racist people are as bad as the people who took part in this tragedy.<br>
<br>
I am not racist toward anyone.  I don't make generalizations about anyone.<br>
<br>
I am proud of my Middle Eastern, and American heritage.  People who believe Middle Easterns should die before the truth even comes out about who did this.....frankly....are sick, disgusting cowards.<br>
<br>
I am prepared for certain people in my home town here where I live, in the United States....and what they will say/do to me.  I am no coward, and if people will single out middle easterns, I will fight back.<br>
<br>
Once again, what happened in the East Coast was a tragedy.  Once again, no one knows who is involved in this.  Before you jump on the &quot;I hate arabs&quot; boat, listen and watch the news first.<br>

Middle Eastern people don't deserve to be punished.  Those people responsible deserve to be punished.<br>

I dont agree with killing anyone but I do believe in fighting for what you believe.  <br>
<br>
some of my best friends are middle eastern and I love them just as much as I love anyone else.  they are family to me.<br>
<br>
do you still support palestine and the leaders?  the people you supported while you totally attacked people(jews and americans) on many previous threads are dancing in the streets for joy over what has happened.<br>
<br>
someone who will suicide bomb children playing in a school yard will also go and HiJack a plane to fly into a building.  the US is against terrorism.  it is not against any race, creed, color, country.  so clue in sparky.  walks like a duck, talks like a duck, so it must be a duck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uazharlioncrest001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azhar Lioncrest001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/01 10:43:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What?</span><hr size=1> I'm not a racist either, and i do not generalize.... but those dickweeds over  in the middle east celebrating and cheering about what happened.... don't realize that it is an act of war and will be delt with....

From what I'm reading on this board at the moment I can easily believe Americans would be dancing on the streets if an atomic bomb was dropped on Palestine (or wherever else). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukanibaalkorpseem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanibaal Korpse EM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 423<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/01 12:11:12 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.somethingawful.com/cliff/ihateyou/uglycat.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A very sad day in history...</span><hr size=1> I wouldnt be dancing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uqaldaliele666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qaldaliele 666</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/freemana/Graphics/mcpi1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/11/01 12:18:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A very sad day in history...</span><hr size=1> Well if this happened to them I wouldnt have been out dancing about it is the difference , however they chose to do this therefore I should say oh they are great people for rejoicing that so many have died. So theres the difference smart guy since you wanna make it seem like americans are the bad guys. They chose civilians targets not military so yes they are cowards. <p>Qaldaliele-<BR>

You want to fuck with my neighbor's/family? I will dance on your grave. Does that make me wrong? I really could care less. All I can say is im not hijacking foreign planes and killing innocent people with them. Try to imagine the fear the people felt when they are sitting on a plane flying back to there family's and having someone decide when your life will end. The last time you will get to see your family and friends. <br>
<br>
Atomic Bomb? Nah... as far as I am concerned that is too swift a death. Dig there fucking eyes out with a goddamn spoon.<br>
