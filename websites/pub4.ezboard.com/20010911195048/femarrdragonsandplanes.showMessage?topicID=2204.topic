<br>
If my group can handle my pulling then there should be no problem, I mean we keep it clear from the Safe Hall all the way to the top floor but people keep coming up to the ledge and say its not camped and they are camping it now. But they dont ASK if its camped. I go up to them and let them know its camped they go where is your group... does it really matter if we are not siting on the ledge? <br>
<br>
I really dont want to be an A00 but come on if the lower lvls are camped and taking all the lower spawns And there is no Ledge group why can not my Safe Hall/3 spawn group take the ledge spawns was well? And not have to fight over it. Its clear and staying clear of spawns.<br>
<br>
Now if there are like 50+ people in the zone I dont mine sharing. They dont ask they just seem to take it for granted that if no one is sitting there that its not camped when there are no spawns there, its like yes its camped And I am pulling please move on. And I do let them know its camped and do ask them to move on I dont shout I dont camplane I just ask them to move on but they dont say anything and just sit there I just keep on pulling.<br>
<br>
If they dont ask or try to make a deal or anything IT really makes ME MAD !!!! come on talk to me say something... anything... like &quot; ok would you like to sit here and we can take the safe hall and we wont pull the ledge floor or the one above it.&quot; Now that would make me happy and I would be more then happy to move IF THERE IS TOOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ZONE. I dont mind sharing at all but PLEASE ask or say SOMETHING just dont sit there like a bump on a log. <br>
<br>
But dont think I well give up the spawns just becouse you ask If there are only a few people in the zone and MY group can take both the top floors and the safe hall we are going to, you well just have to go somewhere else in the zone. And NO I DONT MEAN TAKE the spawns from someone else IF THEY are there already. But if no one is there and my group can do 3 floors I AM GOING TO PULL THEM.<br>
<br>
So please do a camp check before you go up there its just a nice thing to do... would you like to take your Lguk group down to the frenzy spawn just to find out its camped but veryone was AFK or did not see your camp check. Its happen I am sure and you had to leave or find another camp its the same with Vlab Please DO use Camp Check and IF someone is pulling please respect there claim or talk to them about it. <br>
<br>
Thanks <br>

People actually use it as justification to take your camp. You would think the fact that there is no mob there would be a bit of a hint, but noooo. <br>
<br>
Half these so called perfect spots seem down right deadly to me, and would probably get me killed if I should, heaven forbid, need a slash, or my evil cat decides to knock the contents of the shelf onto my head (y'know, for example). Besides that, how am I to know which is the prefect spot? I just figure things out as I go along. Perhaps I should be guided everywhere by a_higher_level_player001, but that would make life dull, and kind of clinical.<br>
<br>
I think the best one that happened to me was someone coming by in OOT and grabbing the ac ph when it popped on the grounds that I wasn't sat on the right bit of sand. I also find particularly cute, people who run past invisible and ask in says, &quot;Is anyone camping this?&quot; then jumping on the first thing that pops. Hell, you might hear them, you might even have a chance to respond. So they're not bad people, right? Another good trick is spamming the zone with 'camp check' because eventually someone won't respond, and then the camp is yours, right? Wrong.<br>
<br>
Now mistakes can happen, fair enough, but when you point out to people you're there, and they start giving you a tirade of abuse because the place you chose to plonk your behind doesn't meet with regulation camp spot 0089.45, in the Book of Beard, then they can shove it, frankly.<br>
<br>
So before you move the wife, the kids, the hamper and the gingham picnic blanket in, and start chowing down on your brocoli quiche, ask yourself: why is there no mob here?<br>
<br>
Okay, not quite on topic, just something that really winds me up.

Actually, the VI policy is &quot;Camp, what's a camp&quot;.  In the minds of the GMs and all other authorities there is no such thing as reserving any spawn.  It is a player rule that people accept.<br>
<br>
That being said, anyone that invokes PnP to get a share of a spawn that another player, or group is camping has my immediate hatred.  It's pretty low to try to weasel in on someone elses hard work for your own gain. <p>Garoan Swiftbolt<Br>

This is a flame directed against the vast number of assholes that run all up and down the ramps of Velk's looking for anything to pull from any camp.  I've grouped with Gaz, and before both he and i had to CONSTANTLY sit on multiple spawns just to keep asses from pulling them. There is very rarely any respect given to groups, it's just that simple.  <br>
<br>
I won't name names, but one time some guy suddenly decided that if Ledge was camped, and I was in Safe Hall, that Safe hall camp consisted solely of the 3 spawns that occur AT the hall and that he was perfectly within his right to pull anything else under us. <br>
<br>
Asses, people wanting to get every single spawn they can grab for their group of soloing purposes.  Half of em don't think anyone notices, and even when they're caught they get pissed at you.  Goddamn I'm happy I don't need velk's xp anymore.  Too bad for people like Gaz who're sitting less than 10 blues from 59 that can solo-duo the Safe Hall camp or Ledge Camp easily.  If it wasn't for pricks that think velk's was created solely to powerlevel themselves it'd make his and others' lives a lot less stressful.  <br>

I do not care what you call your camp and where your spiders are if i see it I WILL PULL IT. I will not respect your camp and I don't care. If you want a camp go to pit or village otherwise we can fight for spiders. <br>

<br>
I don't think the ramps should be any kind of camps, should just be a free for all, if you want an established camp move to the pit, village, or further on past the village, thier is a well you can go down, castle to go inn, and a gully full of tenitcle whippy things.<br>
