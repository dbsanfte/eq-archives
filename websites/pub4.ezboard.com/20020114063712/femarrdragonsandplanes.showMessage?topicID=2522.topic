The same also always happens in game. I already gave it up to communicate or discuss something with ppl when they start to have a problem with me, since as soon as they see my grammer they dont even listen to my arguments, they just write i am to stupid to know the language.<br>
I guess 85% of the ppl who play the game will fall back during a discussion to start flameing to the other ppl that their language is too worse, as soon as they dont have any arguments left.<br>
Well guess i have to live with this fact. lucky there is always the ignore command <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

  It's true, there is no law that says ppl have to speak english in game.  As an American who's lived on 4 continents, I think one of the major disadvantages to being American is the lack of exposure to different languages.  Being Bi-lingual in the US is not even the norm, while in Europe for example, it's not uncommon to meet someone who has a command of 3 or more languages.  I remember a time I studied japanese all day so I could ask blaze of glory to retrieve my body during their Fear raid that evening and thank them properly when they helped.  Hey Seelendieb, think I could bribe ya to send me some Diebel's Alt..  The beer over here is gonna kill me!!!<br>

<br>
First off, the game is an internet based game and last I checked the internet reached every nation around the world. (Though it is illegal under Taliban rule). This means that Many of the people you meet in game do not speak english as their native language. Some do not speak english at all. <br>
<br>
Second, at least half of the people that speak english as their primary tongue misuse words, phrases or generally just can't spell. <br>
<br>
Third, Most of us cannot type as fast or accurately as we can speak, especially while doing something else, such as fighting. Try playing a bard, weaving 3-4 songs, and holding a conversation. The last thing im going to worry about is my grammar. <br>
<br>
The major point is that the EQ community is not a monocultural community. Ironically, I would bet that none of the people who whine about people's language ability, come from a monocultural community. I know that I don't speak the same dialects of english that anyone I live near speaks. I have homes in Nebraska and Texas and if I were to go shopping down town I could expect to hear people speaking American English in several dialects, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, Arabic, Hindi and Japanese.<br>
<br>
We don't accept it anymore when people say, 'You're in america, now, speak english.' That view has long been relegated to the redneck white hood wearing mentality.<br>
<br>
Just the other day I was on a raid in an outdoor zone with my guild who frequently allies themselves with the Japanese Guilds and had them along. The Japanese have multiple guilds that all work together so they use OOC to communicate. I would like to say that I am amazed that the japanese have adapted a variation of their language that uses the english alphabet. So, anyway, the Japanese are using OOC to organize and issue orders, and this dimwit shouts, 'If you are going to use your native language, keep it in tells.' Shortly thereafter I sent Dimwit01 a tell, 'So, do you speak solely in tells when you use your native language?'<br>
<br>
I know other cultures around the world have to deal with the overabundance of english speaking travelers. While I was in Italy, Germany and France, no one ever told me 'Learn to speak the language correctly, idiot' even though I know I totally butchered their languages. I did well enough to get what I was asking for, mostly because the europeans had the patience to think about what I said instead of bitching about my language skills. <br>
<br>
Now, I have to admit, that I am not a purist on the acceptance of other languages. I fully believe that if you are going to have someone working in a customer service position that they should fluently speak and understand the language of the customers.<br>

It's actually kind of embarrassing that so many people speak it as a second (or third, fourth, whatever) language better than a lot of people who speak it as a first.<br>
<br>
I'll openly admit that I trash some people (Chiteng) for how they type, but I'm not one to do that to someone who isn't using his or her native tongue (there are exceptions, such as if someone demeans someone else for not speaking/typing well but fails to do it right himself).<br>

<br>
On the subject of going to main continent Europe and butchering the languages, my experience is that you receive a knowing (and slightly smug) smile and then the person replies to you in perfect English. Which is fair enough, I would probably do the same if I could.<br>
<br>
I am forever intensely impressed with anyone who can speak a language other than their own, because the only thing I know is how to say: &quot;Vous avez l'air d'un grande aubergine et votre mere couche avec des animaux.&quot; This is not ever so helpful I can tell you.<br>

Nuzum....I bought my EQ in dutch...with the Real DUTCHbox , that means it must be a DUTCH game ..right?<br>
Hope you realise that in a language barrier we all will be wrong or right.<br>
I can see the effectiveniss for speaking English..after all it was chosen as World's international language,(Hope you know what I mean.) just as french once was.But don't drive the english crap through please.I think everyone realised this and doesn't need to have their noses rubbed it in ..at least not in Everquest.<br>
As for the foreign posters. Cheers.we shall overthrown the English dictators someday../grin<br>

You know Nazum, I really hope you were joking with that post of yours.  If you weren't, there is a chap in Afganistan, bin in the news quite a bit, you might have heard of him, who is following a similar line of thought to that, just from a different angle than yours.  You two should talk, possibly even kill each other during the opening greetings as you argue which is the greatest language/race/colour/etc.<br>

As for multi langs, I was playing with, I believe her name is Angelwild, really cool person.  She speaks English as a tertiary language, with Swahili and German as her main.  Man, great laugh to play with, but we got into a group once and the leader of that group got very impatient with her inability to understand quickly what was being said.  He booted her.  I left voluntarily. <p>______________________
