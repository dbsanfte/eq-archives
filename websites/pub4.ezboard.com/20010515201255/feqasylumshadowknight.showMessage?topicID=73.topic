<br>
  The first Character I ever played to significant level was Tamyan Navarre, my Teir'Dal Enchanter, who is currently retired at level 30.  Tamyan was made at the same time as another character, played by a friend of mine named Elizar Navarre, my Shadow Knight brother.  Elizar was Tamyan's protector, the one tank I could count on to defend my life.   When he left the game, Tamyan was left in a world where Tanks protected the clerics, not the enchanter.<br>
<br>
  When I made Dokuga, I wanted a character who could protect enchanters, and do it well.  Shadow Knights have exellent taunt ability, and are unsurpassed in there once a day uber taunt ability (read: HT), when taunt is really needed to save a life in an emergency situation, we do it best.<br>
<br>
  I also liked the idea of a tank who gained his ability to do so through constantly regaining his hitpoints back, rather than having a sheer mass of HPs.  This is one of the reasons I made an Iksar over a Troll or an Ogre.  Specifically, I see Vampiric Embrace and the lifetap line as one of our more defining abilities, and I wanted to be able to use them to maximum effect.<br>
<br>
  Finally I guess I wanted to take the hardest path I could find.  A tank who cannot wear plate, isn't bubbling over with hitpoints, has the worst faction and xp chart in the game.  Every level I gain, every mob I help kill is my own personal /rude to Verant, I am beating them by walking the hardest road they could lay out for me (I was also pretty damn sure I would never get nerfed).<br>
<br>
Well now that you've read all this (or even if you haven't), out with your stories on why you made your Shadow Knights and who they are.....</font><P><p align="center"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/dokugatiyohali/dokuga_ban2.jpg" border="0" <P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#D5D4D5><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubumikisk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bumikiSK</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>w4nn4b3!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>11/13/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>5:47:09 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Why I made my Shadow Knight....(long)</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">My story is simple. Played a rogue to 17 was having troble finding groups and as most know rogues solo worse that warriors. At the same time I was helping a friend who had recently lost his account due to the backstabbing of a friend and was helping him get some lvls back when I told him of my problem. He told me to be a shadowknight because they can solo if they want and are also great in groups. Plus he said that it was the easiest to get higher lvl shaadowknight suff due the lack of high lvl shadowknight. So I bought a set of bronze armor, an axe of the iron back and havent played another charater since.</font><P>Bumiki

Bleh, after that I picked a shadowknight. Got him to level 12...but the hybrid xp penalty annoyed me to no end. The highest I've ever gotten an SK was a 48 erudite, and I didn't even play him half the time, my bro did. I've burned through every class/race combo in the game.<br>
<br>
dunno, I'm bored. So I'm posting on your boards here. I am now Jeka Kiril, warrior extraordinaire. Why I chose a warrior? I like the battle, I chose dark elf because there are few of us. <br>

I then found out that a new server was opening so I decided to give it a shot.  When it came time to choose class and race I really did not know what i wanted.  I liked being about to scout and pull so I took a chance and guessed that an SK would be a good choice.  I picked the race of human because I wanted to be original and have a disadvantage as far as stats go (I like challenges)... Cazic thule server, for example, was mainly troll, DE and ogre shadowknights.<br>
<br>
Well after 7 months and 58 lvls with this character I am really glad I am an SK.  It took me very few lvls to realize i'm truly satisfied with this class; eg. getting darkforge was probably the most satisfing thing that has happened to me with this character. In addition, i'm happy to say that there has not been one time where I wish I was another class, even if I spend my time sitting with the druids and other hybrids during VS raids hehe.  We have so many functions and skills we can add to a group dispite what people think.  <br>
<br>
If you have reached lvl 30 or above you should feel proud.  If you play your class right you can be far more effective than any warrior or monk (apart from tanking uber mobs and a few other situations).<br>

<br>
My first char, was a WE rogue, mostly played those in D&amp;D and other rpgs. Started on RZ. bah....After getting 15 with an ogre warrior, I couldn't possibly stand the PVP there any longer.<br>
Moved to Tribunal, and got a 17troll warrior, and 25 druid. Friends and I decided to move to Lanys, the day it opened, I made another troll warrior. Played him to 20, didn't like where I put the stats(all dex)So, I remade him(all agl). He was a mean troll, at 20, could plow through all of crushbone, and solo Crush(not D'vin, he's a gimp)But I really, really missed my spells as a druid. So, deciding that 'agl' helped more in melee than anything else, I made a ranger(melee'ish with all my cool druid spells, putting all points into agl) At lvl 15, I had(with buff) 160 agl. At lvl 22, crush would stomp me, easy. I managed to stumach playing him to 25. I recalled the damage I would do as my troll warrior, with just a Grobb cleaver I was doing SOO much more damage at lvl 20, than my ranger at 25 with BTClaws, and ssom. And I couldn't take NEAR as much damage. And having played a necro to lvl 12, I missed my pet. So, I looked at what the sk got...(this was JUST before kunark and the post 50spell list had just came out) and I almost cryed. The horrible amount of power that SK's got, I just HAD to make one. THe platewearing-phearcasting-pethaving-dottossing-lifetaptapping monsters of pure beauty. I thought to myself...&quot;wth didn't I start with an sk 8 months ago????&quot; So, I made Stompin. and now at lvl 40, and just under 800 ac, can double for over 100 damage. OMG this char has made me 'happy' playing eq. and as far as the EXP penalty goes....I don't see it. Certianly not from 1-25, having the 25ranger, 25druid, 20rogue, and about 3 lvl 20 warriors, I don't see much of a difference. But I wouldn't trade this 40, for any other 40 class/race combo in the game.I can solo, or group effeciantly, and have fun either way.I soloed my first Griffon at 35(it was a white con) and soloed first giant at 39. <br>
<br>
*cheers* to all SK's, we have ownership(perhaps purchaced on credit, but ownership therein contained nontheless) the buttocks of all that which is simien in nature.<br>

                          come into power after this Level, and it only gets better. Only 2 other classes<br>
                          get FD (feign Death) and Sk's make great pullers because of this. Lifespike, a<br>
                          good Stick to smack 'em wid, and Vampiric Embrace,are a good combo. At level 39 you                            get some Rockin spells, Heart flutter, Shadow Vortex, and Expulse Undead, and our first                            buff  Shieldskin,to name a few. These coupled with the  Darkness and Debuff line really                            make a critter weak.<br>
<br>
                          I hope after 50, all continues as good as it had, I have had alot of fun with my <br>
                          SK Troll. I have met alot of good people in this game. I think because Sk's are <br>
                          so hard, I haven't heard of many who reach a high level that aren't genuinely                                         good peole and help others.<br>
<br>
                          Duel to the Horrible Exp penalties, this class is one of the hardest, especially if<br>
                          your a Troll (like ME)or ISK but it is a very rewarding class and I love it.<br>
             <br>
                          I also read about Drizzit and his exploits and have played Computer based D&amp;D <br>
                          games all my life and have waited for a game such as this. There really was no other                           choice for me as I see it!<br>
<br>
Well I hope to see ya all soon!<br>
and Bash em guud!<br>
