That was in reference to AoR, fyi AoR never had any problems at all with any guilds anywhere, at any time, the past members have no 'actions' to 'look at'.  If you're half the man i remember you'll retract that please Tuan.<br>

<br>
Please post something factual or get back to slagging off your guildmates behind their backs (and spare me ''oh mitch destroyed a 5k bracer cause i really could give a shit).  You do remember the last time someone accused me of this dont you?  name Lieran ring any bells?

Yup its true, unlike the worst specimens on here i back someone if imho i think they are right, i spoke up for Ven and DK 'many' times in reference to this whole thing.  Do they care?  no,  should they?  ..no, did i ever mention it..hell no.<br>

<br>
hmm, never said you were evil, i don't really have any idea what you might be like.  i have memories of various ways that you acted, and it is true that you have a varied personality, as i see it.  but i don't think that constitutes call you evil or thinking you commit evil acts.  i think you are a bit fixated on the concept if you are even (sarcastically) applying it to yourself when i never even implied it.  i simply said you should start using some common sense and stop making statements based on assumptions founded under the most minimal amount of information.<br>
<br>
khir (sp?):<br>
i don't blame verant for the actions of uber guilds, but i give it it's proper role.  the game boundaries push the attitude, it creates an environment in which those people prone to the attitude can get ahead faster.  they end up in great guilds and the effect starts.  i figure people are accountable for their actions, as are guilds, but i won't judge them based on actions seen in a game that promotes such an attitude in order to maintain an end game power status.<br>
<br>
jaeden:<br>
<br>
you probably should have expected AoR to be discussed in the same manner as dakor when you posted that post by zolen, he discusses the two of them as such, so they'll both be discussed that way here.  i don't think anyone thinks badly of AoR, at least i've never heard anything really negative.  just a lot of people who made fun of mitch..and the flame threads between you and feather that i think most people didn't take as a reflection of the guild.  just a disagreement between people.<br>
<br>
mitch:<br>
<br>
i think vendrix was referring to all the accusations that fly your way.  implications and such don't mean guilt, just controversy.  and you, my dear, are a drama breeder, you know it!<br>

I only meant that in a broad term.  Everyone at some point has had a problem with someone else or some guild for whatever reason.  No matter how small or how insignificant, they have.  By that statement I made I was telling Chiteng to look at himself and those around him for a change and decide if he is so perfect to be driving his crusade.  I was not trying to offend anyone who was in AoR, and frankly I don't even know who was in that guild and what happened to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukhiranwn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khir Anwn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/7/01 5:43:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Show of Hands...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> After all the posts that I have made and all the flames that DK has replied in<br>

<br>
So it was political, just a faction fight? Not actually a moral crusade against evil. Care to come down to my level again and explain this one Chiteng, because to stupid old me you seem to be contradicting yourself. <br>
<br>
And you're right, who held which spawn in Guk two years ago isn't important to me. I was elsewhere, enjoying myself.<br>
<br>
I do believe Chiteng, that were you not such a paranoid obsessive you might actually have a point. Sadly this is not the case. The fact that you continuously thread jack with what you delusionally believe is some holy mission, some divine quest for the betterment of all God's EQ players, is baffling to say the least. That we must constantly dam the seemingly unstoppable flow of your mental diorhea, before we are subsumed, is not acceptable. Kindly desist. <br>

Furthermore, whether or not it is right and noble to die for ones country has nothing whatsoever to do with this topic, nor infact the entirety of the Everquest game. <br>

Who is the primary readership<br>
aimed at? Who is the board administrator? Hmmm seems to me that there is a pattern.</font><br>
<br>
According to the main page there are “5272 registered members.” Regardless of the fact that 3-4 of them are probably you in various states of mental stability, that leaves over 5000 people who have the ability to chime in and support you, but don’t.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>That and the fact that people I never heard of before will tell me in game<br>
that they agree with me and enjoy my posts. Yes I assume you will choose to not believe that, and that is fine by me.</font><br>
<br>
Why wouldn’t I believe that, people do the same to me(well, when I played). I'm grounded in reality and I know what’s believable and what’s not, that’s where you and I differ. You regard anyone who supports Da`Kor as a liar, cheat or exploiter and anyone who speaks out against us as a prophet of truth and justice. Even Mitch is telling you to shut the fuck up because you’re depleting the worlds crack supply at such an accelerated rate, yet you continue on and on. Are you an aspiring Energizer Bunny or one of those ‘last word no matter what’ freaks?<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>As for me liking monks - wow what a surprise. You ignored the other part of that.<br>
The ability to talk to them to verify what actually happens. That doesnt exist<br>
with DaKor, since it never makes any mistakes.</font><br>
<br>
So what you're saying is, my whole guild is condemned to a life of eternal damnation because we didn’t have 1 Monk that you could talk to? You couldn’t, ohhh… send a /tell to someone from any OTHER class, maybe? You really are a nutcase, seriously. You wearing your K-Mart underwear, Ray? Is it almost time for Wapner?<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>As for Mitch - you absolute jackass, she has been faithfully trying to supress<br>
this little banter for YEARS. I assumed you and she were at a minimum associates<br>
if not freinds. She has taken your side on issues more often than I care to remember. And you publicly burn her. You creep.</font><br>
<br>
First off, I can’t believe you just called me a creep. Who talks like that anymore?<br>
<br>
I said absolutely nothing to “burn her” I simply referred to a post, in the past few months that had well over 150 replies from various people. I didn’t say she was a loot whore, I didn’t say I condemned her actions, fuck… I didn’t even say I cared. I was simply pointing out the fact that you loathe some of my guild mates because of hearsay [note: see why Chiteng thought Rand left Da`Kor] and here was testimony from scores of people about someone you consider one of the good guys.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>if you can find one negative thing about beba</font><br>
<br>
He types really, really… slow. I didn’t think he spoke English when I first met him.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>A guild admits that it walked into lowerguk and simply camped the entire level.</font><br>
<br>
You messed it up, allow me to correct. “A guild admits that it walked into <I>an empty</I> lowerguk and simply camped the entire <I>dead side of the</I> level.” Go on, tell me I'm a liar oh great Seer of Emarr. Tell me how we trained anyone who was in the way or how we, somehow, managed to camp all of Lower Guk, both live and dead side. You cant, because we didn’t. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

There is reality and there is fantasy. Reality is politicaly I lost a faction fight.<br>
The facts are I had an idealized concept towards EQ and I didnt realize that<br>
it would be neccesary to NOT tread on any toes on the way up. Sadly when I see<br>
a jerk in game I call them on it in game. At 12th? level or so the FIRST jerk I ran into was Tzzird. He didnt like what I had to say about him KSing Lockjaw.<br>
He didnt need the items he did it for profit. I was trying at that time to help<br>
Smogg get his staff. Well Tzzird had more pull than I did. I never did back off<br>
and we found new things to disagree about. Many many new things.<br>
<br>
Eventually we ended up in bugged HK. At the time it was an impressive xp mine<br>
handing out what turned out to be bugged xp per kill. We didnt know that.<br>
But Tzzird asserted that we should keep it a secret to prevent the Hoi Pollou<br>
out. So we did. Two weeks later there was of course yet another ingroup<br>
Chiteng/Tzzird fight. Remdar wasnt there to break it up. The upshot was that<br>
I was left out of the group and 'if' I wanted to play in HK I would need to recruit<br>
'other' people. So I did, I recruited Shadon and Lyra. That set Tzzird off.<br>
I have never seen anyone go into as big a hissy fit as he did. He sent me a tell<br>
that was indeed prophetic. I am sorry to say I cant recall his exact words but<br>
the general gist was that I was dead on EM. He would see to it that no one would group with me, etc etc. With the revelation of easy xp in HK yes indeed new people<br>
did show up, (like Sudo for example)<br>
<br>
Well eventually Khir they locked up all available clerics. Without a cleric you cant do diddly. Period. So realizing that at the moment the situation was hopeless,<br>
I left for Tribunal.<br>
<br>
I was gone I suppose 4-6 months I dont recall. Long enough that there were too many clerics for them to lock up all of them. But in the meantime they created<br>
DaKor.<br>
<br>
That is the root cause of the entire thing. A simple interpersonal dislike.<br>
I have never denied this. However that doesnt mean that I cant look<br>
for other things to utilize. With someone like Tzzird it is immpossible to NOT<br>
be a jerk. Sooner or later he would do something that I could use. In addition<br>
The revealation about Remdar not only made me angry but gave me a real<br>
cause to promote. Does the prime mover diminish the cause? Not at all.<br>
Or at least not to me. Then the real ugliness of the Uber groups became evident.<br>
No one was willing to cross DaKor no matter what they did. No one was even<br>
willing to admit that DaKor did anything wrong. That subtle blackmail offended me.<br>
I realized that I was in a unique position. Having already lost, I had nothing to lose.<br>
I could say and do anything I wished. I didnt actually hate DaKor until the Justicia<br>
incident. They treated her shamefully. I hope Remdar burns in hell for it.<br>
But even then she just took it. Even then the fear of the blacklist was too strong.<br>
<br>
That freind Khir is why I fight. No one has that right. To debase another person<br>
for your own gain is EVIL. I will fight anyone anywhere that I see do that.<br>
I do it in reality, and I do it here. I reported a manager that pressured a female<br>
employee under his control to have sex with him. I lost a 70k/year job.<br>
I would do it again in a heartbeat. He lost HIS job. Ok so I took a big hit.<br>
But Crass EVIL must be fought. To not act in the face of base behavior makes YOU<br>
just as guilty and in addition quite likely a coward.<br>
<br>
I wont have time to post this week. So flame away<br>

You should look at the Furor VS Tweety thread on the FOH board.  <br>
<br>
This guy Megalo jumps in and he sounds soooo much like you, I thought it had to be you, but it turns out he was from a different server.  The resemblance was uncanny, right down to the haiku-like paragraphs.  He claimed he was a feared flame writer on whatever his home board was, but the other people who knew of him rediculed the idea.  Of course he payed no attention to them.<br>
<br>
What's worse is he hijacked the Tweety side of the thread AND GOT ASSRAPED BECAUSE HE WAS SO FUCKING FULL OF HIMSELF THAT HE NEVER BOTHERED TO CHECK IF HE WAS MAKING AN IOTA OF SENSE.  HE WAS SO SELF INVOLVED THAT HE JUST KEPT POSTING AND THEY JUST KEPT MAKING A MOCKERY OF HIM OVER AND OVER.<br>
<br>
Guess what Chiteng.  You aren't annoying because you are clever or make forceful points.  You are nothing but a literary mosquito with a blunt stinger.  I would like to humbly suggest that you shut the fuck up before you make yourself look like an even bigger FREAK.<br>

Will you hurt me? Nope. You are not my audience. You are extraneous.<br>

Surley if my posts have no truth in them and if nothing I say has merit,<br>
why read them? No better use for your time? That is YOUR problem is it is true.<br>

Put the weed down and step away from the Bong, you’re flagged.<br>
<br>
I know right off that not everyone has read all the flames written on this board since implementation, but there have been some epic battles between Da`Kor and many, many people/guilds. To say no one has ever crossed us is just wrong. We won some, we lost some, but we were definitely called on 99.9% of the shit we ever did to someone. You can stick your head back in the sand and keep pretending these things don’t exist, but they do - Ostrich boy.<br>
<br>
As for the matter with Justicia, fuck her in the goat ass(™ TS). So she wasn’t able to loot an Ethereal Mist breastplate when it dropped, boo hoo. It could have been because the people fighting got a ton of adds and she camped, leaving only one Cleric in the zone – Remdar(Leiran dead, I believe). She was already camped out when the breastplate was discovered. Remdar looted and died. Had he not gotten it, no one would have, but somehow that’s the better of the two options in your warped mind. The way I heard it(yes, this is hearsay) it was his turn in the loot rotation anyway, but you can take that up with Leiran if you want.<br>
<br>
I think we more than made up for it by including her in a random for the first Tobrin’s Mystical Eyepatch to drop on the server, a random which she won and never should have been included in. She had already expressed very clearly, her explicit hatred for my guild when she showed up at the first Lady Vox slaying, uninvited. She wasn’t in a group, I'm not even sure she cast a single buff or heal before/during the fight, but Ogmuk included her in the random anyway…and she won. Debt paid in full – fuck off.<br>
<br>
A few weeks later we got paid back for our generosity with a train at the Sol B entrance as we were zoning in. She brought the Stone Spider and about 3-4 LDC’s with her, killing numerous people as they zoned in. How did she repay us for giving her that fine piece of eyewear, “I don’t res Da`Kor.” We didn’t go looking for a reason to hate or blackball her, she handed it to us on a silver platter, gift-wrapped. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Maybe in Kunark and Velious (where the mobs hit pretty hard) that's true, but I am a shaman who was sole healer for my group (monk, monk, enchie, shaman, bard) from level 30 when we all met in CT until about level 51 when it became really difficult to keep up with the damage output of Kunark mobs.<br>
<br>
We did great, we spent about 80% of our time in deserted dungeons (Dalnir, Nurga, Droga, Kaesora, CoM) and it was my absolute favorite time in EQ.<br>

I'm tired of every post involving a past, current, or future Da`kor member degenerating into this shit because you refuse to get the fuck on with it. You've made your points(some of which may very well be valid) but we've all heard them  a thousand times now and there is no point in repeating them over and over. If you don't have any new content to add, please refrain from posting anything at all.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=2491.topic&start=221&stop=237>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2529.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2387.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=2491.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=2491.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2491.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2491.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
