Honestly, I don't think this will go over very well execpt to feed the egos of the l33wt hogs who want crap named after them.<br>
<br>
/agree Arikel<br>
<br>
Despite bitching to the contrary, most folks simply do not want dynamic content, unless it provides phat lewt.<br>
<br>
For instance, when Paw was changed, there was bitching.<br>
<br>
There was bitching when Kith got nasty.<br>
<br>
When L Fay was taken over by minions of Thule, folks whined about how it was unsafe.<br>
<br>
During the recent Halloween events, fokks were bitching about the &quot;new&quot; zones, especially Rathe Mnt.  I heard many folks ask when this will end, becasue they wanted their HG's back.<br>
<br>
And lets not forget the Sleeper, another attempt at dynamic plots.  He was meant to be awoken, yet after he is, there is bitching about loot no longer availiable.  Then there is talk about a quest to put him back so we can do it all over again...endlessly...<br>
<br>
Lets be honest.  99% of EQ folkd just want the same old boring routine.  Same mobs, same loot.  Thier idea of questing is taking notes off a spoiler site. They will level all their characters up in the same 5 familiar zones.  Change something, and they get pissy.<br>
<br>
True trailblazers are hard to find.  This new server will basically let folks pay to be trailblazers.  Hip Hip Horray!<br>
<br>
As an aside, I have always suspected that someday Verant will allow you to pay to have a customized item made just for you.  This server seems the first step in that direction. <p>Myzzan Masterpoet -Vivix Protectorate.  Voted "Miss Vivix 2001"

I'm puzzled.. &quot;/rude verant&quot; ?<br>
<br>
This makes no sense.  Where did the $10 a month service say it would include your own webpage, legendary items, guild halls, dynamic content, dynamic quests every day, historical quests etc?<br>
<br>
So they offer a new service, why is this bad? They obviously don't have the resources to do this on EVERY server and to accomidate 300,000 people.<br>
<br>
If you don't like their new legends server, don't pay for the service.  If you think it costs to much, don't pay it.  And you know what? You can continue on in EQ as you normally do without doing anything different.<br>
<br>
If you would think before following the crowd with &quot;/rude verant&quot; maybe you could actually formulate your *gasp* own intelligent opinion! <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughiastormwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghia Stormwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/1/02 8:52:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8528.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Legends</span><hr size=1> I think one of the big problems they are going to see is the true diehards that might really like this and be willing to pay are going to have more then one account.  <br>

I think 40 a month might be worth it but then between my husband and I we have 5 accounts.  There is no way we could afford that for 5 accounts.  So say you just take your 2 main accounts then we have to deal with not having our porter.

<br>
take out the webpage part and youll have what Verant has promised scince phase4 beta. legendary items? yup promised, in fact At the start of emarr there were many quests for legendary items, i know a few ppl with artifacts myself.<br>
<br>
So they offer a new service, why is this bad? <br>
<br>
Instead of delivering on the promises they made in the past, Verant has added the webpage content, and a minor detail or two and is gonna charge you thru the nose . Once it is proven that dumbass's will pay more for online games, guess what? well all pay for more .<br>
<br>
Its a proven fact that Verant is out for themselves not your interests. they are in this to make money.<br>
<br>
Its better to create a wholly different game than to creat a 2 tier system for the same game. It cheepens it for those who have spent time, money ect.<br>
<br>
No I wont be trying it out, why bother, bigger and better games will be along soon enough, verant realizes this too, thats why they are offering the eq-as-it-should-be-package. they know EQ has a limited time left, so instead of making it better for all they are suckering ppl like you into paying more to play for the short run.<br>
<br>
UO is still around, why? becuase they have never caved to the two tier game system, and yes they discussed it as well but decided not.<br>
<br>
This action might very well ensure EQ's deathnell.....<br>

However, that stuff is pretty much just window dressing.  The dynamic content and legendary items are what this is really about.  EQ _did_ advertise dynamic content, and while it didn't specifically advertise items named after players it did lead one to believe that treasure in the game would be something special rather than just a reward for a long-ass camp.  Those are the real meat of this service, and they were either advertised as part of the original game or implied to one degree or another by said advertising. <p>Erevan MacQuaide, cleric of Nimue <BR>

Where has Verant ever said they would be just adding such in-depth dynamic content daily along with new quests all the time as they are claiming with the legends server?<br>
<br>
I just looked at the EQ box's and I don't see it. The closest I see is something like &quot;changing world&quot;, which is so general they are talking about the changing player base which affects the world.<br>
<br>
The point is this- people are expecting this to be free, without realizing it is an ADDITION to the service already given which requires a lot of capital to perform such services.<br>
<br>
I really don't think such dynamicitiy (is this a word? =P) has EVER been implied to EQ. Everyone has always said the world is static bla bla and left it at that. Now they are trying to change this but can't provide this to 300,000+ people.<br>
<br>
You know the other problem? Lets say they COULD provide it to 10,000 people without charing the customers any more right now... Who gets it? There are lke 30+ EQ servers, so do they give each server 1 new quest a month or 1 server a new quest every day and dedidcate their time to a small player base?<br>
<br>
They chose the smart route and basically said - 'Hey, we have this new dynamic content service but we can't provide it to everyone, if you want this addition to the game, we are going to require a higher monthly fee'...<br>
<br>
Is that so unfair? <br>
<br>
I'm just really siding on verant on this one because I consider this a costly addition to the game. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utuan00dorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuan00Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1039<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/1/02 9:53:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8528.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Legends</span><hr size=1> See more responses...

Verant didn't print &quot;changing world&quot; on the box expecting us to think of the fluctuations of the VS rotation.  They expected potential customers to think of a dynamic world, and they were right.  They never suggested _daily_ dynamic content, but given VI's track record I doubt they'll live up to all of these promises completely.  I'll believe &quot;daily&quot; dynamic content when I see it... or more likely, when I hear about it from players who have seen it. <p>Erevan MacQuaide, cleric of Nimue <BR>

Maybe you should be using yours, you are taking words out of context and applying values to them that are not the true meaning.<br>
<br>
A changing world has usually been in the context of a changing player base and an occational zone being added, which they have deon.  They have never used the word dynamic to describe anything, which is the appropriate word in such an environment.<br>
<br>
I'll help everyone out here<br>
<br>
dynamic - Characterized by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  continuous</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> change, activity, or progress: <br>
<br>
Notice how much they use the word dynamic on their website? There is a huge different between dynamic and changing, and dynamic, in any computer field, is costly.<br>
<br>
Yes, I agree from $10 to $40 is a big jump, but it might be neccessary for what they want to do. If they do what they claim (which is what I am assuming, if you aren't going to assume this a discussion is pointless).  As stated earlier, they are in this for profit and this could very well be an amount they need to charge for such service.. <p>Tuan {Cupcakes} the Vicar</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utuan00dorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuan00Dorf</A> at: 2/1/02 11:06:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uquistabris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quis Tabris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/1/02 11:26:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8528.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ Legends</span><hr size=1> &quot;In EverQuest Legends, truly unique and<br>

Hay rich kids make your rich daddy pay $40 a month and we will give you lots of lewt and if you ever have a problem we will show you around by the hand. You will no longer need to live with the muck coverd players that are to cheap to pay us more money. Also you get to shover all the god gear we give you to into the common players face.<br>
<br>
but that just how people make money.<br>
