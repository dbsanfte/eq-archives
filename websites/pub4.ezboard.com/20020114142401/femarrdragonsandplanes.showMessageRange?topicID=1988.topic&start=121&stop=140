  &quot;No amount of good deeds, or acting in good faith will convince people who have an axe to grind and seek to harass, stir trouble, and generally badmouth other people. For me i have this set of assholes to deal with:  Jaieq Maeghant<br>
Elwyn.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Okay, seems I made it onto a really wierd little list... I can't speak for the others, but I guess I'm on it because I tend to drop seemingly inevitable posts into the threads surrounding Mitch's latest sexploits on the Emarr board.  I suppose the argumentation here is that my opinion isn't valid because my opinion on the subject has not waivered?  Idunno...<br>
<br>
  Needless to say, I would wager you'll add a few more names onto your list after this thread as you progressively alienate, if I had to guess, 75% of the readers who review it.  Bump the magic list of people you aren't responsible for appeasing up to 6 or so and you should be able to manage with a clear head again.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Now its irrelevant that i have never (to my knowledge) either grouped with any of them, been guilded with any of them or ever had any in-game conflicts with them (certainly nothing of any import). In fact we have not interacted in any way in-game and yet they, because of the type of dickheads they are always seek to get in any type of flame on me no matter how lame or, and this is important, even when they know it is not in fact true.&quot;<br>
<br>
  But what could I possibly &quot;know it is not in fact true&quot;?  I read the thread and you are holding an in game item hostage for percieved insult.  That's some hella childish shit, but I knew you had it in ya, butterwhore.  The black heli's flying over your blood red sky of ghetto righteousness really don't have much place here...<br>
<br>
  And we have grouped, ahh... and we talked about larger guild oriented issues and it was interesting... and our entire in-game philosophies were incompatible.  I basically knew after about 2 hrs that we'd never get along.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh and Jaieq gladly admits he is a dickhead, Elwyn used to have 'Dickhead' on his DK profile page so its not like they hide the fact. Maeghant /shrug, he simply trolls.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Oh, I do not!  Well, maybe I do.  Have you ever drawn the correlation between devil's advocate and troll?  They are suprisingly similar, but for some reason &quot;troll&quot; is the height of insult and &quot;devil's advocate&quot; means you are smart and insightfull.  But what would you know of any of that, you flatulating penile implant?<br>
<br>
  Why don't you just give the bracer back, you cancerous crotchsore?<br>

<br>
just to clear up one point about the ebay and me that I brought into it and mitch elaborated upon.  <br>
<br>
mitch and I got married in-game a while back... anyone that knew me back then would remember for sure the wedding in naggy's throne room.  The same day mitch gave me as a PRESENT the tranix crown... as well as the same day I gave mitch a platinum diamond ring and a platinum jacinth (ring I think?) as presents.<br>
<br>
time flew by and I didnt notice as eq consumed me... I realized how close I was to my real life wedding and still no wedding ring and my fiance and I were running short on wedding funds (reception and photos are expensive).  A friend of mine offered to buy my account.  I sold it with equipment as is, and all.  The tink bag was just handed to me one day from mitch.. was it a gift? never truly said... was it loaned? never really said... just... &quot;here ya go&quot;.  so I took it, as we often just handed items back and forth (such as jewelry I made [gold diamond mask for free, free resist jewelry sets and the such])<br>
<br>
After spoken to by my friend and mitch about the situation with the tranix crown I simply said, &quot;return the wedding gifts you recieved from mythlum and he will return the crown.  Para said that the plat bs necklace was never paid for and he is happy that it was part of my RL wedding in the end and he doesnt know why mitch was claiming it was his/hers&quot;<br>
after I sent this email to both mitch and my friend I never heard from mitch again via email.<br>
<br>
Yes, Mitch and I fought with eachother (side by side) from around lvl5-50+ right before I sold mythlum.  I would help power mitch using my enchanter or my necro when (s)he asked.  I would yell at anyone tarnishing his/her name when I caught them, and did my best to keep mitch's name on the + side of the server... even turned down invites into guilds because they wouldnt take us as a pair.<br>
<br>
The only reason I post on any board is to express how I feel or what I am thinking... not to test waters with someone who cares more about game items then someone's real life... yes... mitch didnt bring the sale out in the open, I did... <br>
<br>
Just hearing someone else talk about gifts made me think of this and I found it rather funny.  I don't really care how the people that didnt know me as mythlum view me in game now, because all of my old friends (asides from mitch obviously) welcomed me back and are happy to talk to me. <br>

<I><b>(2)Any and all stolen and/or compromised accounts that are reported to SOE will be banned, and no items will be reimbursed. Any player found to be involved in an account theft will have any and all of his/her accounts banned.</I></b><br>

<br>
<I><b>Yes, if it is compromised in any way, it will be banned.</I></b><br>

Now, in the purest sense this refers only to accounts that were hacked with or without your knowledge, but! I wouldn’t get them[GMs] involved if I could at all help it. All it takes in one trigger happy, bad-day-having asshole with a GM tag to oust you from a game for the heinous crime of reporting the theft of gear.<br>
<br>
We all know how well they listen and communicate to each other. That’s why it makes no sense to /petition anything other than “send me a tell” because your going to have to re-type the problem at least 2-3 more times anyway. All it takes is one bad interpretation of your /petition to earn you a ban. Work this out amongst yourselves, fags. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

<br>
I used to like you as a player, kicking Aviak ass together in SK, and later on in game as we occasionally happened to be in the same zone, but DAMN, you're making yourself look bad here!!!<br>
<br>
If Areo had meant the item as a gift he would have specifically said so at the time.  When he says he would need to replace it AND you agreed to help do so means you are committed to either a) hand back the bracer to Areo, or b) help him camp another one.<br>
<br>
That you were apparently ignoring Areo's requests in game is why this all ended up on here, if you didn't want to speak to him *face to face* in game, you should at least have found a go-between to talk via and arrange to solve the situation between the two of you so that you were both happy(ish).<br>
<br>
To spitefully destroy the bracer is about the worst thing you could have done, especially in the light of the fact that you like to trade.  How many people will be so willing to trade/trust you if this is the kind of action you now stoop to?  Why didn't you just give the bracer back at the start of this and then put Areo on /ignore if it was so much of a problem?  You really only have yourself to blame for this thread when all is said and done by ignoring Areo in game in the first place.<br>
<br>
But then again, seems you like the attention, good or bad, in the first place, you have to be a politician <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You tend to lash out at anyone who questions any of your actions with 1000 word+ diatribes, so I am going to keep this short and neutral.<br>
<br>
Areos loaned you a bracer and has had a hard (impossible?) time getting it back.  You both agree to that.<br>
<br>
He comes to the message board to get your attention and slams you a bit.  This pisses you off, but *something* obviously led him to this.  Areos isnt exactly posting here constantly (unlike some folks /cough).<br>
<br>
After dozens of posts that have gone WAY off track, you slip in a little gem about how you will not give him his bracer back as a &quot;punishment&quot;.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, your supporters (the few that there are), continue to point out that the bracer is &quot;only 5k&quot;, and that Areos should somehow not even be trying to get it back even though he loaned it.<br>
<br>
Now Mitch, do you really not see how this is fucked up and how you are clearly wrong?  If you don't, then you are definitely more in need of counseling then those that you so frequently recommend go seek it.<br>

But anyways... Mitch said most American's couldn't count the stars on the flag and that made a instant blackball on the &quot;will-trade/help/assist list&quot;.  I used to think you were just some person that sat around wanting to trade all day, but instead I see you are just some person that likes to try to insult everyone to get some kind of rise.  I wish you luck in whatever you are trying to do in Everquest or on the boards here.  Lastly Mitch, if you are looking to get a rise out of someone, why not walk into a bar and walk up to a group of guys and call them a bunch of faggots (or whatever brit slang you would use) to see how tough you really are instead of playing the digital tough cross dresser.<br>
<br>
I could also support Tyras in his effort for freedom of speech, but thats just a waste of time, and I tried that a few months ago only to have the people say &quot;if you dont like the board then post elsewhere&quot; answer.<br>

Mitch, Keeping that Bracer and destroying it is petty and childish.  That one act has proven to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you clearly have no concept of honor or right and wrong.<br>
<br>
I've never had a dealing with you in any way shape or form.  From what has been said, that means my opinion carries no water with you at all.  But, it still holds true.  You have proven to be an untrustworthy person who values items (and pixelated ones at that) over people.  I hope you enjoy all of your EQ plat.  Give your plat and dragon haste a big hug for me tonight when you go to bed.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Off the top of my head: England gave me Neil Gaiman, Pink Floyd, The Cure, Warhammer 40K, Red Dwarf, and Monty Python among other things. <p>Islington Angelwatch<br>

You've made your own bed in this situation, Mitch. You won't care obviously, but my opinion has changed finally. <br>
<br>
I've always tried to give you the benefit of the doubt thru all of the bad blood that went with your leaving DG, thru all of the needless flaming you do on this board, and thru other incidents you've been involved in. Why I did so is because by and large you were nice to me when I was in DG way back when and you seemed to be a nice person. I also like Mythlum a lot and it transferred a bit more like to you due to your association with him.<br>
<br>
But enough is enough. No need to flame me because I won't participate in your snipe and hide tactics. Just don't consider me as someone who respects you anymore. My apologies. <p><br><br><br><center><a
