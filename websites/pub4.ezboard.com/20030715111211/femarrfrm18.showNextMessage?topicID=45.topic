Well, at least this made me feel a little better.  And for heavens sake don't pick a fight here.  We're all well aware of America's misdoings in the past, so don't mark it here.  What this is is a little pick-me-up.)<br>
<br>
<br>
America: The Good Neighbor.<br>
<br>
Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth. <br>
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.<br>
<br>
When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.<br>
<br>
When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by <br>
tornadoes. Nobody helped.<br>
<br>
The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other <br>
country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why <br>
do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?<br>
<br>
Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.<br>
<br>
You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon-not once, but several times-and safely home again. You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at.<br>
<br>
Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.<br>
<br>
When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke.<br>
<br>
I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.<br>
<br>
Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is not one of those.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Stand proud, America! <br>

<br>
By Leonard Pitts Jr. <br>
Syndicated columnist / Seattle Times <br>
<br>
They pay me to tease shades of meaning from social and <br>
cultural issues, to provide words that help make sense <br>
of that which troubles the American soul. <br>
<br>
But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears <br>
sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to <br>
say, the only words that seem to fit, must be <br>
addressed to the unknown author of this suffering. <br>
<br>
You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard. <br>
<br>
What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's <br>
attack on our World Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? <br>
What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever it was, <br>
please know that you failed. <br>
<br>
Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned <br>
your cause. <br>
<br>
Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our <br>
resolve. <br>
<br>
Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us <br>
together. <br>
<br>
Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and <br>
quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, cultural, <br>
political and class division, but a family <br>
nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of <br>
expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural <br>
minutiae, a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's <br>
misfortune, a cartoon mouse. <br>
<br>
We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability <br>
of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of <br>
that, we walk through life with a certain sense of <br>
blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, <br>
though - peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle <br>
to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the <br>
overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, <br>
believers in a just and loving God. <br>
<br>
Some people - you, perhaps - think that any or all of <br>
this makes us weak. <br>
<br>
You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are <br>
strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals. <br>
<br>
Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are <br>
in shock. We're still grappling with the unreality of <br>
the awful thing you did, still working to make <br>
ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect <br>
from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot <br>
development from a Tom Clancy novel. <br>
<br>
Both in terms of the awful scope of its ambition and <br>
the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely <br>
to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the <br>
history of the United States and, indeed, the history <br>
of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been <br>
bloodied before. <br>
<br>
But there's a gulf of difference between making us <br>
bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan <br>
was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone <br>
hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such <br>
abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are <br>
righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When <br>
provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any <br>
suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the <br>
pursuit of justice. <br>
<br>
I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know <br>
my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know <br>
reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread <br>
of the future. <br>
<br>
In days to come, there will be recrimination and <br>
accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose <br>
failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to <br>
prevent it from happening again. There will be <br>
heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic <br>
freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered, <br>
chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably <br>
determined. <br>
<br>
You see, there is steel beneath this velvet. That <br>
aspect of our character is seldom understood by people <br>
who don't know us well. On this day, the family's <br>
bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will weep, <br>
as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will <br>
rise in defense of all that we cherish. <br>
<br>
Still, I keep wondering what it was you hoped to teach <br>
us. It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to <br>
know the depths of your hatred. <br>
<br>
If that's the case, consider the message received. And <br>
take this message in exchange: You don't know my <br>
people. You don't know what we're about. You don't <br>
know what you just started. <br>
<br>
But you're about to learn.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubilelorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bilelorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/13/01 7:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: Paper</span><hr size=1> that article..the second one was also in the Miami Herald.<br>

Every 4th of July, I see american patriotism bring everyone together in this country, and even though I am not american, I am moved by it. I was very moved by the sight of all the senate members, standing together singing Amazing Grace after hearing of the terrible attack. <br>
<br>
As a greatful friend of the American people, I want to say thank you for always doing your best to help others and for always sticking by us in our times of need. With all the resources and power at the disposal of the american government, it is easy to take your friendship for granted, and say &quot;they're big boys, they can take care of themselves.&quot; <br>
