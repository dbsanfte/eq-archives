As I stated before I did not lie to anyone in my guild, I told them to read the post and make their own decisions.  The GM's stated I was not in the wrong at ALL!!! Yet I face the repricussions to one individual who is angry and made many threats to me in game. He used this &quot;Shit List&quot; as some sort of intimidation tactic for doing nothing wrong. I tried to make ammends, but yet I get it thrown back at me. Rratiz was no where near the chancellor they were at the begining of the hallway far far away. All I see here is everyone jumps on the true Paladin band wagon, but there are many alignments in this world as you will see when you grow up Rratiz. I am Barbarian, I crush , I bash, and I have limited intelligance. If you really hate me then come duel me- bring anyone you wish to watch or line up next, if not please quit your crying, You are smearing my war paint.<br>

Fact is, what you did was and is wrong.  And please, be a man and admit you lack skills rather then trying to cop out saying your actions are due to you RPing the low intelligence of a barbarian.  Also, you argued that you didnt KS as the Chancellor was below 50% health, but becuase you looted him and kept the spear despite not being the one to kill him you became a ninja looter instead (far worse in my eyes).  It's bad enough that you trained them the first time, to go back and jack the one thing they were there for in the first place is downright dirty.<br>

Please do keep posting, even though you said you had given your final word, as you make yourself look better and better with every post.<br>
<br>
Read a few messages back and you'll see that you are the one who started resorting to personal attacks about the intelligence, education, and credibility of Ghorall, Rratiz and myself.  It's always lovely when people cannot respond to the issue and attack the individuals on a personal level instead.<br>
<br>
You tell me not to slander you unless I know the truth?  Unfortunately, I was there and and I was the one who died for your greedy actions.  You took a totally controlled situation and turned it into chaos for our group by trying to steal the Chancellor.  Today I sent a tell to a 15th level Dark Elf whose name escapes me, but it started with a 'D', and this is the person who told me that you had told your guild that you had offered me the spear you stole from our group.  I see no reason for them to lie to me about what you told them.<br>
<br>
Finally, to have you bring alignment into this just makes me laugh.  This shit list is NOT in character.  The alignment of your avatar is not what is being questioned here.  What *is* being brought to light by this thread - that YOU invited me to respond to - is your attitude towards other players on the Lanys Tvyll server.<br>
<br>
Frankly, your attitude stinks, and I am glad that Ghorall decided to start this thread, and am even happier still that you called for my input into this matter.  I had let the whole matter drop, but since *you* asked me to respond, I did so.  I did not lie, I did not exaggerate.  I simply related what happened to me and the group that I was a part of.<br>
<br>
Normally I think it's pointless to add to a thread in this newsgroup, but your behaviour before, after and during this incident leads me to believe that you deserve to be on this list.<br>

<br>
coughbullshitcough<br>
<br>
I've played pnp RPGs since before you were probably born. I'll state it again in case you've missed numerous posts on the RPG topic. EQ is not an RPG. There is no reward/punishment for roleplay.<br>
<br>
As to the other, you tried to make amends for what? You pushed past others who were clearing to the mob that you also wanted. They were there first. You then couldn't handle that mob and trained them with what you could not handle. You then returned, attempted to KS the mob. When you could not, you hunkered down next to the mob spam clicking loot until you were able to take the item that you yourself had not gained. This is all information from you very own posts.<br>
<br>
What about this is roleplay? Oh, I get it, &quot;I'm not really an asshole in real life I just play one on EverQuest&quot;.<br>
<br>
Your actions based SOLELY on your own account of the events more then merits you being posted on this list. <br>
<br>
Had you truly wanted to make amends, you would not have looted the item. Or you would have offered it to the group. Claiming that you did it because you were called a name (which quite frankly I've seen nothing to show that you were not indeed an ass) or now because you &quot;roleplay&quot; is beyond pathetic.<br>
<br>
You did it because you wanted the item, and that was apparently the only thing that mattered to you at that point in time. And ninjalooting is absolutely something that you can be shitlisted for. Which you've admitted to doing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

<br>
RPGs for people who've played pnp games had alignment heavily configured within the game. Factions doesn't even come close. Who you were, and how you played who you were figured heavily into the game. Whether or not it would even be possible to code something similar I don't know. But EQ is *not* a rpg. There is no penalty in the game for Dark Elven clerics healing High Elves. There is no penalty for a paladin who acts against the beliefs of his class/race/ and diety. Hell, I've taken out Inny more then once and he's my GOD. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anyway, that's a whole other discussion and while Warbreed brought it up I don't want to hijack this thread from the issue.<br>
<br>
As far as him being an ass...<br>
Let's see.<br>
<br>
He rushed past people who were grouped and obviously clearing the room, to get to the one mob that people clear that room for. When he couldn't take the mob successfully he ran back past the very people he just zoomed by, training them with said mob as well as a few of it's friends. Yeah, that makes someone pretty much an ass.<br>
<br>
Hardly a rush to name calling. /shrug. I'd have called him worse.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, what he did belongs on this list, and there is more then enough information from both sides for people to draw their own conclusions I think. <br>

if they got experience from it then you ks'ed it.  sorry but it's true.  you ran, they engaged, they killed, you looted.  see the problem there?<br>

We have now heard both sides, and it sounds overwhelming that the 'community' believes Warbreed should be shitlisted.  I understand this was a first time offense, and realize that this will likely get filed due to that fact.  However the fact that it is going to be saved here in case he gets brought back up for something again is a great thing and I am glad to see that this type of behavior is frowned upon and treated this way.<br>
<br>
Rylex, you mentioned chancellor gating at 45%, you are correct, he does not.  That, like so many other 'facts' in Warbreeds story was a lie.  He does not gate that soon, he did not get killed by anything but Ghorall's DoT and unfortunately my group was worried more about the situation and saving lives then the loot.  Personally that loot should have rotted, but past is past I guess.<br>
<br>
Warbreed, you seem to believe you and I have a hatred thing.  I do not hate you, per say.  I think what you did was inappropriate.  I believe you have lied repeatedly to twist the view here.  I think you have made it well known to people that you would and will again ninja loot an item it it suits your needs.  You believe you want a duel, well first I am not afraid to duel you, however I am not a 'part-time' roleplayer like yourself.  I also do not thrive on the pain of others in this game.  I play EQ to group with friends and meet people that enjoy helping each other.  As much as you agitate me, I hope enough people read this message and your circle of friends shrinks ever so slightly!<br>
<br>
To all friends of Warbreed that have messaged me.  Please, I can appreciate your friendship, but know this, you telling me that I should change my mind and clear Warbreed's 'good name' is not going to work.  Ghorall posted here, and I added because what he did was not an offense that the GM's could deal with.  However, it was an offense that the Lanys community of players could deal with and could make a verdict on.  Read ALL these messages again and come to your own conclusion but taking just his word or mine will only tell a piece of the story.  Don't bother trying to pressure me again with big guild names, or high level friends, I don't intimidate well.  If you have an offense to post on me, post it here, petition it to a gm but do not just sit and loom them at me hoping I will crush below!<br>

Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br>

The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.&quot;<br>

There's nothing about the timer here, infact it seems that they are talking about the timer being up.

I even said in my post it is a shitty thing to do. But Verant Interactive needs to redefine ninja looting. The above mentioned circumstance has happened to me a few times and NO CS Rep told me that the person was in violation and would be taken care of even when I did try to argue based on their definition of ninja looting. Said CS Rep simply stated to me that &quot;the timer ran out and it was free for others to loot, you should have looted before it was open to the public&quot;. And as for naggy, he's a bit different than the average exp mob in that it requires more than 6 people to kill him. With VI's stance 36 people could go on a naggy raid, if all of them die but 1 then that remaining person is the sole proprietor of everything on nagafen's corpse, sounds a bit fucked up doesn't it? The point is Warbreed is an ass, I am agreeing with this. He tried to KS something, couldn't, so he hung around and waited for the corpse to go public and looted it. It is a fucked up thing to do to someone but (unfortunately I might add) he was within his rights as a player to do it.<br>
<br>
Garnette: You jump to conclusions and assume things. Hmmmmmmmm this tells me a lot<br>
<br>
Aarreran: each GM (not guide) interprets the PNP in their own way. From what I have experienced with Jhek, Dynan and Frizznik, once the timer runs out on something that is not a raid required mob it's every man for himself. Each GM has their stance on it. Go reread the PNP on how camp sharing is to be done, ever see it happen that way? <p><img src="http://www.seven-dreams.org/images/rylex.jpg">

I don't disagree with what you said, and I don't disagree that the rules aren't followed strictly, but you stated that &quot;according to VI&quot; it is supposed to be like that.

As for this being shit listable, I can't really go either direction.  If it were me there, I would have definately shit listed him.  Looking at it from without makes me think not.<br>

This is not a Verant-run forum and we are not Verant employees, so no matter what the &quot;official&quot; policy dictates for this incident, it is irrelevant here.  In fact if it were something a GM could quickly fix, say returning the spear and reprimanding Warbreed, this post would likely never have been made in the first place since this list is, as is so often stated, a last resort.  Probably 90% of the posts on this list are things that are either not technically against Verant's rules or are unable to be pursued by GM's simply due to the fact that none witnessed the events.  <br>
<br>
And for Warbreed, if you want your good name restored there is a simple solution:  Return the spear you clearly Ninja'd and maybe offer a humble apology to the group you wronged.  Having your friends send tells to try and &quot;convince&quot; them to drop the matter (sounded as if threats may have been involved but I'll leave that to those involved) look like the actions of a guilty conscience and a guilty man. <p><IMG SRC="http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/sig1.jpg"> <BR>

They state clearly in their Official Strategy Guide that ninja-looting is looting a kill that was not yours without the permission of those who did kill it, if they are in attendance. Now they turn around with this timer bullshit and want to change the rules in mid-game.<br>
<br>
This same Strategy Guide also lists some rules of etiquette concerning camps:<br>
Pg. 239, Paragraph 1<br>
&quot;If a party is already at a spawn point when you arrive, respect their camp and don't pull from that area. Especially if they are in a room, everything in that room is 'theirs.'<br>
If you want to camp a site, but someone else is already there, you might ask if you can take the next turn...if they don't, wish them luck and find another camp site, or if necessary, another dungeon.&quot;<br>
<br>
Verant breaks their own rules as fast as they make them. It's up to the players to make and enforce rules acceptable to them. That's why it's common courtesy to do a camp check in an area you just arrived in. It's common courtesy to not loot something you didn't kill. It's common courtesy to shout &quot;Train!&quot; if you're the one pulling it to zone.<br>
<br>
Apparently, Warbreed is lacking in common courtesy. That, therefore, makes him an asshole. And as I recall, Leolan has stated this board is for assholes. This isn't one thing he screwed up, this is THREE seperate offenses all rolled into one horrendous incident.<br>
<br>
Warbreed, your guild is on my personal shitlist. I am going to assume the worst of them unless they prove otherwise. This is YOUR doing. Had you been honorable to some degree, this would not have occurred.<br>

  And Rylex I don't jump to conclusions.  I read your post twice and the way I see it, is you think since a GM can not enforce something like that, then it isn't shit listable well as you can see alot of people don't feel that way.  This board is to take something like what he did one step further then the GM's and make people aware of the type of person he is.  No he didn't "KS" but he sure as hell did train and ninja loot.  Let me rephrase that, from the witnesses reports, since I did not witness it, he trained and ninja looted.<br>
