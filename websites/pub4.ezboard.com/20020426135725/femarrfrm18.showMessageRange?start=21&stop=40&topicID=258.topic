<br>
I think you believe that there is something glorious about being a victim. I think you're a fool.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The U.S. sent troops to Europe which meant landing inside Europe, not America, as combined allies to conclude the war: to the countries visited by the war.&quot;<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Last time I checked, sending troops into combat implied you were fighting a war.&quot; - Kytherion<br>
<br>
Incorrect, America did not literally visit itself within an all consuming war between friend and foe.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Listen...um...Misty. When countries fight wars, the actual land mass of that country doesn't necessarily heave up and throw itself at the other land masses involved. No offense, but your English really isn't good enough to play semantic games. The United States was fighting a war.<br>
<br>
Whether or not a war takes place on your own soil has NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, IDIOT. By that definition, Germany wasn't fighting a war until the Allies crossed into the Rhine.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
&quot;Newsflash, I'm not British nor European nor American. Your irrelevance is astonishing. I find the implied nationality a dumb conclusion since I never offered that inference.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't refer to your nationality at all. Where did I imply anything of the sort? I mean, unless there's a country for mealy-mouthed halfwits, I'd just assume you were from Oakland or something.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;As for my opinion, I still believe America did military service but bear in mind I do not believe you entirely suffered the true cost met by Europe for that war.&quot;<br>
<br>
AND WHEN, YOU DRIBBLING EXCUSE FOR SIMIAN, WILL YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SUFFERING DOES NOT MEAN VICTORY?<br>
<br>
Victory? You've heard of it? Involves defeating someone else? Winning wars, that sort of thing?<br>
<br>
Getting the shit kicked out of your civilian population has nothing to with it. Losing is the opposite of it. The fact that they did SUFFER, implies that they were losing, BADLY. Do you understand that now?<br>
<br>
<br>
In the end, this wasn't a discussion of who suffered more during the war, which is why I had a hard time understanding what the hell you were saying. <br>
<br>
Suffering is never a contribution. Try to remember that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=misty>Misty</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/dwmac/eq12.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 235<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/13/02 2:26:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=258.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mushmouth strikes 2 - doh!</span><hr size=1> Kytherion:<br>

No matter how much noise one makes about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> who</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> fought a war, who else thinks about that war from that single point of view? America won the war? That's news. If you want to know what ppl think about yourself personally - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> do not consult yourself for their opinion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - now there's a real fool for you. Are you getting a hint?<br>
<br>
Fact: the U.S. military fought at the 2nd World War, they were fighting on the Allies side; observe that America at home alone did not fight a war, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it watched its troops fighting at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> war over in Europe</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, some time after the general conflict began. To be precise. You assinine pus-cake gobbler.<br>
<br>
I never referred to the U.S. as a victim of the Great War precisely for reasons I speak about: casualties are 'victims' of war, military combatants are not solely 'fighting the war' so much as performing their duty to engage enemy; people and governments fight each other, and others fight the fallout from that conflict just to stay alive. Troops merely constitute war preparedness. The people of America stayed home. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> actual</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> war effort is something you misunderstand totally, it appears some effort on your part to reduce the conflict to which side simply gets more credit today - honestly do you deserve all credit for the Great War? Like I said, pretty biased. Sure the United States govt. gets credit for its leaders stand with allies back then, and it did finally commit. No criticism intended [/wave]U.S. military gave admirable service for their country AND for the world, more credit to U.S. military for that. <br>
<br>
It doesn't get any more creditable, than that, sorry if your rubber duck feels deflated. Kiss my independent ass g'day, mate.<br>

<br>
I am not going to get into that since people have already told you that and you make it clear you won't accept it.<br>
<br>
I will, however, point out that suffering is endured by winner and loser alike.  When a nation goes to war it is inevitable that it will suffer.  The only thing to be determined is the degree to which they suffer.<br>
<br>
Sometimes victory only comes at the cost of great sacrifice, which would be considered suffering.  Never let us get to the point that we are so proud of victory that we don't suffer with those who paid the price. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

<br>
Excuse me, but how do you think fights are won? Answer the question, my little tulip. Do you think you win  a fight with defense? No, you don't.<br>
<br>
You win a fight by knocking the other man out.<br>
<br>
Did American troops and supplies constitute the large majority of the OFFENSIVE against Germany? Yes, they did.<br>
<br>
So did we knock the other man out? Yes, we did. <br>
<br>
Then I guess we did win the war, didn't we? Yes, we did.<br>
<br>
So I guess that must be news to you. <br>
<br>
If you've got your little finger on some alternate history, then share it...mate. If the rest of the Allies didn't NEED American assistance, then why did they work so hard to get it?<br>
<br>
ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION, GENIUS. I can't wait.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact: the U.S. military fought at the 2nd World War, they were fighting on the Allies side; observe that America at home alone did not fight a war, it watched its troops fighting at THE war over in Europe...&quot;<br>
<br>
So now America is some...what...seperate entity from its people? &quot;It&quot;? What is &quot;it&quot;? You think a country is some kind of nebulous construct that just dispatches soldiers and then sits back to watch with a bowl of popcorn?<br>
<br>
You think those troops materialized from thin air? No, they were drafted, from the general population. The rest of the population worked to support the troops. <br>
<br>
You want me to get a grip? Why don't you get an education.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The people of America stayed home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really? Well, I guess the conscriptions never happened. Must be a myth. You hear that everyone? My grandfather stayed home. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;...honestly do you deserve all credit for the Great War?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope. I've merely asserted the position that the Allies could not have WON the war without America. <br>
<br>
You see, Misty...come here, son. You see, when you fight people, it's a good idea to win. Getting the shit kicked out you isn't a good thing. You don't get credit for having to scrape your teeth out of the dirt.<br>
<br>
Taking credit on the basis of getting your ass beaten to a pulp doesn't impress anyone, mostly because it's stupid. <br>
<br>
When you win, you get the credit. If you do most of the work towards winning, you get most of the credit. That's life.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't want you to think that I don't understand you. I understand your point of view. <br>
<br>
You think that since our civilians at home weren't slaughtered en masse, that we didn't actually fight in the war. You think that since we underwent no significant hardship, that we don't deserve the credit of winning.<br>
<br>
One question, though. If someone tries for an hour to open a jar of mayo, and then his roomate comes in and pops it open with ease...who gets the credit?<br>
<br>
His roomate does. The other guy is just a dip who tried for an hour to open a stupid mayo jar and failed miserably.<br>
<br>
His roomie opened the mayo, Misty. Not him. The first guy certainly suffered, but the second guy was definitely the winner.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day. Enjoy the mayo.<br>

<br>
These kind of statements are statements that really &quot;irk&quot; me. It's interesting to note that over 70% of german casulties came by the hand of Russian soldiers. It was the Russians who were engaged in the largest battles in the War, and the largest sieges of the war. From the battle of Stalingrad, to the battle which later become known as the &quot;death ride&quot; of the 4th Panzer army (on the Kursk Salient), where German and Soviet armor clashed in the greatest tank battle of WWII. The nimble but outgunned Soviet T-34 medium tanks literally charged into the ranks of the mighty German Tiger tanks. This battle, made at the cost of great Soviet losses, finally broke the power of German Panzer troops. It was the Soviets that first broke the German front lines, and it was the Soviets who on April 30th planted there flag in Berlin. <br>
<br>
I believe it was Stalin who said something like &quot;The Americans provide the Money, the British provide the Courage, and the Russians provide the Blood&quot;. <br>
<br>
However, it's easy to downplay the role of the Soviets. It's easy to suggest that anyone who was a victim, was a &quot;loser&quot; (which is often not the case).<br>
<br>
However, unlike Mistywolf, i do believe American's made important contributions. From the amphibious invasion in Sicily(which in terms of troops and ships was larger then operation overlord), to D-day itself (and the opening of a second front), American's contributions were undoubtadly important. Also, it's hard to ignore the British, who also made significant contributions to both Sicily and D-day, and the rest of the war. <br>
<br>
And while you may &quot;lose a war&quot; or a battle, you are a winner because no matter how bad you lost, you still caused the German's to loose many men, many vehicles, and at the very least, time, ammunition, oil, and money. <br>
<br>
The war was not won by the Americans, it was won by everyone who fought in the war, against the oppression of Nazi germany. <br>
<br>
Most of my readings (Atleast to refresh my memory of what i know from the past), are obtained from the Encyclopedia Britanica &quot;The Experience of WWII&quot;, and one of the chapters, is called &quot;The Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany&quot;. <br>

American participation did not amount to that scale of 'involvement'. Didn't crack 'Enigma' either. Any kind of fight to stay alive against the interdicts of enemy states constitutes human valor in war action: fighting starvation, loss of home and family, fleeing invasion, resistance, counter-intelligence, sabotage etc. By that token America had less involvement than entire nations had and that may have been the very factor which decided the war. Hah. Funny when looked at that way. Overall survival of nation &gt; point scoring<br>

You make an excellent point regarding Soviet contributions, and I should have given greater attention to that part of the war.<br>
<br>
However.<br>
<br>
It is a known fact that the British and American offensive was halted in order to allow the Soviets to &quot;catch up&quot;...this was done in order to allow the Russians to save face.<br>
<br>
We did not meet in Berlin and split the city because it was necessary for victory. We did so for political reasons, and nothing more. That we were sitting around waiting, while the Soviets hurried to show up using the equipment we gave them, says a great deal.<br>
<br>
On a sidenote, were those 70% casualties taken by defensive action or offensive action? I'm guessing defensive, although I admit my relative ignorance on the subject of the Eastern front.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Misty:<br>
<br>
&quot;American participation did not amount to that scale of 'involvement'.&quot;<br>
<br>
What scale of involvement? Getting our ass kicked? Gee, sorry. I know that in your reality, you can only be involved in a war if someone is kicking the shit out of you.<br>
<br>
Although, it is possible that if I came from a place where getting the shit kicked out of me happened in every war, I might begin to feel the same. Not that you come from such a place.<br>
<br>
You'll have to excuse me. We're not used to losing, here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't crack 'Enigma' either.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cracked the Japanese version. And for the record, most of the work on Enigma was done by a group of exiled Poles, even though the Brits like to take the credit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Any kind of fight to stay alive against the interdicts of enemy states constitutes human valor in war action: fighting starvation, loss of home and family, fleeing invasion...&quot;<br>
<br>
Marvelous! So eating and fleeing is valorous?<br>
<br>
Lovely. And here I was under the impression that defiance in the face of overwhelming odds represented true courage.<br>
<br>
I'm SO glad you've set me straight. Eating and fleeing is really all we need. You see? Fleeing is valorous. I get it. I really do.<br>
<br>
So the thousands of civilian Filipinos who took to the hills in order to wage guerilla warfare were, in fact, cowardly. And the British civilians who refused to surrender, even as they were being bombed into oblivion, and even when Hitler offered peace...they were actually foolish.<br>
<br>
Stunning! A revelation.<br>
<br>
Oh, no, wait. You're fucking wrong. Sorry. Doh!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;By that token America had less involvement than entire nations had and that may have been the very factor which decided the war. Hah. Funny when looked at that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, by that token, and when we look at it that way. By the same token, the Afghanis are the most valorous people in the world at the moment. Eating and fleeing everayday, for months now. Regular stalwarts, I'd say.<br>
<br>

It is fortunate that Churchill would have disagreed with you...otherwise we'd not be having this conversation. <br>

<br>
If the Allies could have won without America, why did they work so hard to secure American support?<br>

My country has never had 'the shit kicked out of it', there has never been a war on Australian soil. Australian soldiers fought with distinction in WW1 and WW2. Australians haven't made a song and dance about winning the war. Our soldiers have quite a good record in action. They were all volunteers there was no draft. A lot were under-age for military service they lied about their age. They were good marksmen, most of populated Australia was farmland and every farmboy grew up with a rifle for shooting rabbits. Farms still have guns today they are exempt from gun laws.<br>
<br>
From memory Alan Turing cracked 'Enigma' not some Poles. I would think you got a couple of hints from his work.<br>
<br>
Do you think a pregnant woman should stand and fight? You are on one long pathetic distortion of the imagination. Why shouldn't a girl or a couple of lost children eat and flee? Why shouldn't an unarmed old man eat and flee, what good will dying unnecessarily do if others are depending on him for their survival? Another thing, those countries were on the winning side: they didn't lose the war.<br>
<br>
Defiance can amount to eating food and hiding to stay alive, plenty of Americans have done that. Many people have done that. Live for the opportunity to strike, preferably when the rest of the country has weapons to arm with. Are you that fucking bigotted you would not consider anybody else thinking of it? What was the resistance?<br>
<br>
Britain was not bombed into oblivion in fact Australian fighter pilots were highly rated in the Battle of Britain. There was plenty of England left and the Germans were not able to defeat the British forces in the air, including Australians and refugee Poles(who incidentally ate and fled).<br>
<br>
You are not worth the effort. /ignore<br>

In answer to your question.. um hello.  Winning or losing the war people try to gain support, in case the unforeseen happens.<br>
<br>
I think Britain would have fallen without our help, but I will not belittle the effort, sacrifice, or defense they put up.  You are a shame to the men who died, and those who lived who certainly didn't pat themselves on the back.  You seem well read, at least of the writings that support your views.  I wish you really could have seen the bodies, the rubble, and the look of absolute defeat on the faces.  I wish you could have explained what took us so long to help while patting yourself on the back.<br>
<br>
Anyway, common sense would tell you that even if Britain thought it was going to win the war... we would be a great ally.  Common sense would tell you that a synergistic view towards the war would mean that the more troops and supplies the allies had the less the loss of lives, both British and American.<br>
<br>
Why did we bomb Japan?  The decision was a hard one to make, but we did it so that we wouldn't lose hundreds of thousands of men trying to island hop more than we already had.<br>
<br>
So what is your question again? Why did they want our support?  Um.. duh.  Is this rhetorical or do I need to put my VERY limited photo shop skills to work and draw you a picture?<br>

WORLD WAR. The world was at war. Kytherion your negation of the resistance is abhorable. Cendan and I disagree on political views, but we agree on history. How would we have beaten the Nazi's without European assistance and the underground resistance? Our spy satellites didn't exist, but maybe Hitler would have let us fly our big bulky spy planes over just so we could figure the lay of the enemy encampments. Nope. The resistance gave us that info. We could never have launched an attack. Normandy was bloody enough and that was considered successful. Normandy was one of the less defended parts of the coastline. It is even speculated that false intelligence was passed to Hitler as to where and when the invasion would have occured. Kyth your history is off in plenty of other places too. Never gotten our asses kicked? Korea, Vietnam, read about Americas successes in SE asia, it's a short chapter. Hell we kicked our own ass in the civil war. Canadians don't pat themselves on the back for not being as stupid as us on that one. The French don't pat themselves on the back for giving us our freedom. Historically it may be easier to prove the French were more pivotal to Americans freedom than the Americans were to Frances. You see the roles were reversed during the revolutionary war. You see America's history isn't always the worlds. We may have helped liberate Europe, but does anybody know who is in charge of Cuba? Didn't we try to help the revolution there.<br>

No, I want Misty to answer it. I want Misty to undermine his own position by answering such a simple question. Unforeseen? There's nothing unforeseen about half a million Germans crouching on the other side of the Channel. That is what I would call foreseen.<br>

&quot;I think Britain would have fallen without our help, but I will not belittle the effort, sacrifice, or defense they put up.  You are a shame to the men who died...&quot;<br>
<br>
Fuck you. I've belittled the Battle of Britain because I mentioned that we supplied the equipment? I've belittled Churchill by...what...mentioning his courage and tenacity? <br>
<br>
I've belittled the cowardly who ran and surrendered. I will always do so. Would you compliment such behavior? Excuse it? Ignore it?<br>
<br>
I can think of no greater shame. Half of our allies are nothing but snivelling cretins who break and run at the first sign of strength, and I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHO HEARS ME SAY IT.<br>
<br>
The behavior of those people during the war was the shame. Even when their neighbors died, or were dragged away, they would not stand. <br>

First off "I was thinking the same thing" falls into the really lame retaliation category.  Secondly, I assure you that class has never stopped you from doing anything unless you have a very inflated opinion of your almost nonexistant class.<br>
<br>
Regardless, moron, collecting photographs doesn't make you a victim.  I said SEE.  I wish you SAW the rubble, the bodies and the defeat.  You think a photo will ever capture despair or the smell of burnt flesh in the air?  Your photos are a lame representation.<br>
<br>
The US has NEVER had to deal with what Europe went through in WWII.  That alone should be enough to make you shut up, but it isn't.  How about you back up off them until you face what you say they ran from.  Talk is cheap and lots of people say they would be brave and maybe you would... but until you are in that position you have no right to judge their actions.<br>
<br>
So Kytherion, tell me, how do you think the dead (the people who DID go through WWII) would feel about you saying the people they died for didn't deserve it?  How do you think they would feel about you turning their deaths into your excuse to brag about the US?  <br>
<br>
You belittle Britain and all the others by taking all the credit for the US.  By over stating our role in the victory you belittle the others.  <br>
<br>
Whatever, you aren't going to learn, but atlease people who read this won't think that all people in the US feel the same way you do.  So the thread isn't useless. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

Actually, i believe as the war was nearing the end (31 March), Eisenhower believed that Berlin was no longer of stragetic importance, and he was backed by Roosevelt in his belief. It has been documented that Churchill even protested these decisions, as he believed that the Allies should go to berlin, but Eisenhower and Roosevelt focused on the Elbe.

Also, as both the Allies and Russians approached Berlin, at there closest, the US and British were 275 Miles away from Berlin (to the west), while the Russians were only 40 miles from the city. The move was both a political, and "practical".

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><font  color="yellow" >On a sidenote, were those 70% casualties taken by defensive action or offensive action? I'm guessing defensive, although I admit my relative ignorance on the subject of the Eastern front</font><!--EZCODE FONT END-->[/font]

Actually, the statistic is all-encompassing. I have seen this statistic in many places, and it states that "Russian Troops accounted for a total of 70% of all German Troop casulties": including offensive and defensive actions, in all battles/fronts that the Russian's were involved in. It should not come as to much of a suprise though, considering that the Eastern front was the largest of the war fronts, and of the Allies, and Russians constitued the majority of the front.

And i do agree that the Land-lease act played a large role in re-equiping many allied troops (who were often in financial troubles).

See my first response in this thread, you subliterate chimp. I do nothing of the sort. I have merely claimed that the Allies would not have won without American support, and have defended that claim.

The truth belittles? Why is it that so?<br>
<br>
Perhaps because the truth is shameful. Perhaps because they are ashamed of themselves. And perhaps they are ashamed for a good reason.<br>
<br>
REPEATEDLY, IDIOT, I have used the examples of both England and the Phillipines as the ideal of resistance. Yet I am told that &quot;running from invasion&quot; is in fact courageous. I am told that I belittle the brave.<br>

Let the brave be honored, and let the cowards be scorned, and I piss on ANYONE who states otherwise.<br>

And if that makes you uncomfortable, then I shall not apologize. <br>

<br>
I do believe it's a &quot;cheap&quot; shot to belittle the deaths of people who were too afraid to fight against the German onslaught (a Horror, as Cendan states, that North America has never had to face). Maybe take into consideration that there were numerous soldiers from the USA who were probably to scared to pick up a gun as well (ever watched Saving Private Ryan - and that soldier who watched the German's kill one of his own men, while cowering in fear). It did happen, yes, even to American soldiers. Is this individual not worthy of an American passport? Should he &quot;a coward and scorned&quot; as you say. I'm sure his family, American citizens, would appreciate that. <br>

<br>
The problem with cowardice is really quite practical. If you are not willing to stand and fight, then usually someone else must take your place. <br>
<br>
At its root, cowardice is more than simple fear. It is an evasion of responsibility. Despite Cendan's inability to read my posts thoroughly, I hold British actions during the war in the highest regard.<br>
<br>
Why? Because they were more than willing to fight...all they asked was for the tools to do so. That is admirable.<br>
<br>
But certain of the other nations? We could have dropped rifles by the ton and they would not have used them. They were fine waiting for someone to come and liberate them...there was little resistance to be found, when we look at the actual population of these countries.<br>
<br>
I do not feel it is a cheap shot to call someone cowardly when they behave in a cowardly fashion. Nor do I feel it is a cheap shot to call someone irresponsible when they fail to live up to their responsibility. France wasn't exactly a nation of people in wheelchairs, were they?<br>
<br>
The bottomline is that some nations fought, even knowing that the consequences could be dire. Other nations offered little resistance, and thereby increased the difficulty for those who did.<br>
<br>
So contrary to what some people espouse in this thread, I will continue to remain old-fashioned in my views. Running away is cowardly, and should be called what it is. Standing your ground is brave, and should be admired accordingly.<br>
<br>
To excuse cowardice is to encourage it. And since MY country that has paid the majority of the bill twice in the last century, it is not in MY interest to excuse it.<br>
 <br>
<br>
When Continental Europe liberates America from a hostile Mexico and then rebuilds it from the ground up for FREE, then Europe can belittle my sorry ass. Because we'll deserve it. We will especially deserve it if we have large numbers of young men standing around doing nothing, waiting to be liberated.<br>
<br>
Will it be a cheap shot? Hell no. It'll be right on the money.<br>

I think you can say that WWII was a team effort for the Allies.<br>

You can Monday morning quarterback all you want.  Doesn't sound like you are old enough to have taken part.  Keep studying your history books and try not to fall prey to yet another 50 cent word - ethnocentrism.<br>
