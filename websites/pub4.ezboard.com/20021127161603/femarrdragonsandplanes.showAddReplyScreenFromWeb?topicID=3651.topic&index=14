You are only entitled to another opinion if it doesn't interfere with those of Bush and co, and yet those opinions are entitled to trample over others if it suits them. Yes. I believe that this is where things are heading, and it worries me. Like you, I also have a problem with extremists and terrorists, and I see the US (current administration, not the people) as expousing an incredibly extremist line, and pushing very close to things that could be defined as terrorism. The front page article in my local newspaper is titled <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/09/20/1032054963259.html">&quot;Bush: how I'll rule the world&quot;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. That scares me.<br>
<br>
In this specific case, I read the caption of the photo, which clearly indicates that this person is expressing support for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> suspected</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Al-Qaeda supporters. I wasn't aware that they are known to have been trained in terrorist training camps. Martigan and Ghie both claim this guy is showing support for Al-Qaeda. As far as I know, he could just have had his friend (whom as far as he is aware have had nothing to do with any terrorist organisation), dragged off to court. He goes along to see them, and some journalist runs up to him and says &quot;So, are you a terrorist too?&quot;. What would you do in such a situation? Flip the journalist (not &quot;the rest of us&quot;) the bird perhaps?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If more people followed the Islamic faith instead of using it as an excuse for terror, a lot of innocent people wouldn't be facing the hardships they are right now. Hardships caused by people with no regard for human life that hide behind a twisted version of a good religion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I agree with you 100%. I do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> think that Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Ladenare good people. I think they seem to have no redeeming qualities at all, and are probably as close to pure evil as you can find.<br>
<br>
I object to the strong bias and hypocracy present in much of the media and many of the opinions presented here. I post largely to present an alternative opinion, in the hopes of opening people's eyes to the fact that such might exist. Sometimes I will quote or link to articles with anti-american sentiments to which I do not neccesarily agree, but I think it is important to recongnise that such differing opinions do exist, and to sit back and take a look at issues from more than one side.<br>
<br>
I just had a brief look at Bush's recently published &quot;National Security Stratergy of the United States of America&quot; (I got it <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/2002/09/21/nss.pdf">from the SMH</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> but there's probably US sources of it closer to you). It refers to rogue states as:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
the US certainly squanders national resources for the personal gain of the &quot;ruling class&quot;, where that is the corporate wealthy.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, and callously violate international treaties to which they are party<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
can't think of a better example of this than the US<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designsof these regimes<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
the US already has WMD, and uses &quot;other advanced military technology&quot; (thankfully no longer WMD) offensively to achieve it's designs<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> sponsor terrorism around the globe; and<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
does not the majority of IRA funding come from the US? funding for Israeli actions against Palestine which many would define as terrorist? It could be argued that US military and covert actions in many other countries would fit definitions of terrorism.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it stands.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Many of the things that much of the rest of the world regards as basic human rights are rejected in the US. Capital punishment. Camp X-Ray. Australia is also way out of line here with mandatory detention of assylum seekers.<br>
<br>
My aim is not to rile people up by pulling emotional strings. In the face of what I see as the incredibly hypocracy shown above, I think it is vital that someone &quot;opens their trap&quot; and speaks up about what is wrong. My concerns are not directed at Americans in general, nor even specifically Bush. America however presents itself as the biggest, easiest target. I am very disturbed by what I see in my own country as well, and speak out against it strongly to fellow Australians. However, on this board, there are far more people who blindly support the US than any other country. There are a lot of comments begining with &quot;Only in America...&quot; and sentiments along the lines of America is the only free country. <p>----------------------------------<br>

It was a lot more open handed than some I've seen in the past.  Americans as a whole do not like war.  We dont like fighting, but we will.  I myself was in the U.S. Marine Corps which is argueably the most die hard group of soldiers the U.S. has.  We're first in and last out.  Do you know what we want more than anything else?  World Peace.  The opportunity to stay with our families and not walk a dark street on the far side of the world wondering when hell is going to break lose.<br>
<br>
The US had a serious fault that was corrected by 911.  We thought that our world here could not be touched.  We were wrong.  Cowards killed thousands of innocents in an act that even managed to make our enemies weep.  As an American, I can tell you that we may fight amongst ourselves, but we do not allow outside forces to do so.  If there is any lesson to be learned from America's history, it is that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> nothing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> makes us pull together and realize what a great place we live in like a tragedy against our people.<br>
<br>
I've read Bush's address, and while he did make comments about not allowing other countries to gain military power comparable to ours, he also said it did not refer to free loving countries that respected basic human rights. We will not allow this to go unpunished, or allow someone else to try it again if it's in our power to stop it.  For a long time we've had a policy of getting hit first (even when we knew it was coming) before reacting.  This will no longer be the case.  As a former military man, I cant fault that.  <br>
<br>
If people feel threatened by this, they probably have a reason to.  If you're a state that's worried about it, that stress is easily relieved.  DONT have state sponsored terrorism.  Dont kill people because you dont like the way they look or their religion.  The US doesn't callously disregard treaties.  We have withdrawn from them, which was done legally by taking steps that were included in the original treaty (ie. ballistic missile shield treaty). <br>
<br>
Sorry to repeat myself but we want nothing more than world peace, however we wont allow atrocities like this to continue.  As far as Sadam is concerned, he's been breathing on borrowed air for many years.  After the acts he perpetrated against his own people, he should have died long ago.  You agree that Osama and Sadam are incarnations of evil but seem to have a problem when the US brings its military might on them.  If we do not stop them.. who will?  The answer is no one.  We dont want this job, but we will do it. <p><a href="http://members.aol.com/wvvetteman/images/dalonhorse1.jpg" target="_blank">

I know when I went to bible school as a child, nothing got us excited like when they pulled out the pistols and submachine guns and taught us how to kill people.  Of course, in the event that didn't work, we always had the classes where the bible tells us to kill ourselves in an attempt to take as many people with me as I could. (I am not saying Islam teaches this.  True Islam teaches that all life is precious as well).<br>
