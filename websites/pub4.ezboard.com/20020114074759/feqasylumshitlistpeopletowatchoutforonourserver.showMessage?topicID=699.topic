I lived and he died. i draged his corpse to a cleric and got him a rez in the mean time i was useing shout to inform everyone that we still had the camp. her and her group heard my shouts and some of them admitted it. when we got there they thought it was there camp. after a little talking they all addmitted it was our camp and left her all by herself. when the last person in her group left her she began to ran around getting aggro and FD-ing right infront of us. she would not stop till we had to run. then my buddy died and i had to pull them to the guards then i went ld and now i am here. i need ot log back on to try to find a rez for my buddy but i thought all of you should know to look out for her.<br>

She is only the 3rd player that I have met in EQ who brought me close to making a SL post on someone. <br>
<br>
My group met her in Dalnirs a few weeks back. We had no clue what we were in for. She was in there soloing on the 3rd floor when we ran into her. We were a good group and were fighting 3 mobs at once in a room when she walked in and asked if we wanted any help with them. We said sure and she started beating on one....but as soon as the one she took was dead  she ran up a hall and dragged a couple more to us and feigned at our feet. Not a big deal ...you get into trouble, you run towards people. We managed to live through it but as that fight ended she was already up the hall ...pulled more, dragged them right to us and feigned at our feet. Now she doesnt get up and fight any that she pulled and dumped on us ...she lays there feigned until we have almost dispatched them and then she stands up and runs back up the hall.<br>
<br>
At this point most of my group members are swearing that she is intentionally training us with them. I have been too busy fighting and trying to stay alive to watch whats going on so I say &quot;are you sure? why would she do that?&quot; <br>
<br>
We only survived one more of her trips up the hall .....she dragged 5 to us and feigned at our feet. <br>
<br>
Now at this point I am still in shock at the notion that someone would intentionally, repeatedly train us for no reason whatsoever. And I am standing naked and dead at the outpost in OT wondering how my group is gonna get their corpses back from a zone that you can't drag them out of, you'd have to fight back up with no gear and the chances of looting your corpse without aggroing is slim and none. <br>
<br>
One of my group members /ted zoccola thanking her for getting us all killed....to which she responded &quot;NP&quot; and she logged off immediately.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fortunately we had petitioned about it and a GM came and summoned the corpses to the zone. Fifteen minutes later Zoccola logged back in and the GM had a little talk with her.<br>
<br>
I can't prove that she did it intentionally, it's possible that she's just a piss poor player who's more than willing to repeatedly run up a hall and draw aggro and sacrifice a nearby group.<br>
<br>
The next day she was in OT where I was yelling for more members for a corner group. When she /ted me wanting in I replied &quot;no thanks&quot; to which she responded &quot;Your loss&quot;( pretty smug lol). She obviously didn't remember me and I am a firm believer in people getting a clue that their behavior will affect their future in EQ ....so I replied with &quot;met ya yesterday hon and I have no desire to repeat that mistake&quot;.<br>
 She then kept asking me where we met (yes she has a right to know what I was talking about) but I was busy fighting and setting up a group and didnt bother answering her. I figure put her on ignore and don't waste the time on her.<br>
<br>
On she comes with an alt to spam me some more only this time she remembers who I am so I get the &quot;You're one of those morons from Dalnirs yesterday&quot;.  And the ignore list grows some more heh.<br>
<br>
Dunno if this shitlist will stick or not, but either way....she will definately end up here again and again. Sometimes you meet a person and the attitude is enough to make you grin, nod and say &quot;ayup, this one will be on the SL in no time&quot;.<br>

The reason I was still there, was I was trying to get back to my 54 cleric, medding in the other room. With NO sow, and 15 hp,  I had no choice but to fd, and send a tell to the cleric. You also Fail to mention, that my cleric friend Rez'd 3 of you from earlier, that is why I had to log, and was abandoned there, was so I could get my DRUID to port him there to REZ you. And you repay me, by accusing me of training you, as I tried to make the exit. With no way to heal, and No HP, all I could do, was get back to the cleric, since 6 of you stood there, and would not assist. EVEN after the cleric told you he was OOM.<br>
Second, the train in CC, was calculated and brought on SOLELY by Krupt. The camp was open, I don't care if you called the camp, if you are NOT physically present, it is an open camp. I have lost many a camp, to death, and had someone walk in and take it over. The spawn was FULL, and I cleared it. THEN you show up, and get rude, and petulant. Sorry you died, deal with it. And after arguing with you over it, I was prepared to just say screw it, because there was nothing there I needed. I was there for the group that had already gotten tired of it. THE ONLY reason I stayed, was Krupts vulgar mouth, and when he called me a fucking cocksucker, there was NO way I was going to give up the camp. I OFFERED to split it, you refused, I OFFERED to duel for it, you refused, and saw fit to spam me with text, spell effects, which are turned off btw, and KS every aggro I drew. So, I brought you enough aggros for everyone to share, and knowing that Krupt died, well, THAT makes my day. <br>
The funniest part Jall, is I have grouped with your RL sister, several times, and she told me what a cupla pricks you 2 are when together, THAT cracks me up, as it proves my point. You were being petulant children throwing a tantrum, and needed a spanking, so I brought you one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zocc>Zocc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/18/01 8:40:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zoccola</span><hr size=1> A group will assemble at the entrance and call a camp maybe even if they cant hold it but just the fact that its an open camp and people respect the fact that if you call something its yours.

End of story, Camp was lost.

<br>
None of what you are discussing ever took place when I was in Dalnir's the day you were there. The place was completely empty except for my group and you.<br>
There was no cleric in there....and in fact I have a level 50 cleric myself....so if anyone in my groups need a rez, I do it. According to my group members, they had almost no conversation with you because you logged so fast. <br>
<br>
Of course I cant rez a char on my own account, so Tiger went unrezzed. Not a big deal. Exp is easly to get back. <br>
<br>
I'm thinking you are talking about a different incident with a different group in Dalnirs......Apparently we weren't the only group that had trouble with you there. This does not surprise me.<br>
<br>
As to the CC incident that got you onthe SL in the first place, you sum it up with this:<br>
<br>
&quot;You were being petulant children throwing a tantrum, and needed a spanking, so I brought you one. &quot;<br>
<br>
Too bad GMs dont read these boards....you'd be waving bye bye to your account. At any rate, there is now no doubt that you belong on the shitlist. Not that you'll care, folks with social problems generally dont care, but at least the community knows to beware.<br>
