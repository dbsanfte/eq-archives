My second post was a response to Malamber's statement to Gorndax, outlining why we have good reason to dislike you. My third post answering something you asked. Now I will give you that my last post was an attack, an attack on your apperent lack of moral standards.<br>
<br>
I would think your parents thaught you the difference between right and wrong, obviously they did not. Lieing is never right. You don't care that someone was accused of something they did not do. Whether they have done something like that before does not matter. Or do you change your ethics to suit you whenever you feel like it?<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with Valric, if it were you in his situation I would still adher to my moral standards and tell the truth. As you stated you do not care if he is falsely accused. Well what if Tormentcia is falsely accused? Oh but that is different, because she is your friend, then the standards would change right?<br>
<br>
What you lack in morals you obvioulsy make up for in arrogance. &quot;How dare you plan a raid on VS without consulting me? Even though I have shown no interest until now and have not run this raid before.&quot; This is the what I get out of your statements. The world must really revolve around you doesn't it? <p><div align=right><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33250><img src=http://www.eqeclipse.com/kiesig.jpg></img></a></div><BR>

Heaven forbid anyone start thinking from the perspective of other people.  <br>
<br>
We all claim that we have the best intentions at hear.  EVERYONE.  But nobody seems to even make an attempt at understanding.<br>
<br>
Every time this thing gets bumped, someone has to reply (this case in point).  Just for the sheer fact that they KNOW they're right.  Can't anyone here accept the fact that they are human and can make mistakes?  Interpretation is one of them.  Hell, I damn sure know I've read threads, felt anger about it, then re-read it and saw the truth of it.<br>
<br>
Everyone that has posted in this thread is guilty of mis-interpretation to some level.  Accept that.  It something that also makes us who we are because things are never black and white.  But to continue on this tirade only proves that not a single person here is open-minded to the idea that they could very well be mistaken about what they are saying.<br>
<br>
Kiera explained how she saw Sagemon's statements.  Do you know what that proves?  That 1)  Sagemon creates threads that are prone to interpretation errors based on a biased that people maintain, though sometimes he is a bit abbrasive and incorrect (he's human afterall).  2)  People with said biased refuse to see through their feelings of what they THINK is the case and jump to conclusions.<br>
<br>
Nobody is wrong here because they merely interpret what they read.  Our failure is when that interpretation is taken to such hostility.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In any event, we've done nothing to but prove that everything in this thread is pretty much a farse.  It's near to impossible to see the truth in anything, realistically speaking. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27492"><img src=http://inferno.wittsend.com/smw/sig.jpg></a>

Kieara, you're choosing to put the worst possible spin on what I said because, for whatever reason, you don't like me.  It's probably a waste of my time, but I'll repeat what I said and explain to you exactly what it means.<br>
<br>
I said the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for the PoG raid, I had someone who was on the raid tell me the same thing that Torm posted. I don't know what happened, because I wasn't there. Frankly, I don't really care whether Valric was falsely accused once. He was guilty on plenty of other occasions. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't know whether your version of what happened is the truth, or whether the version that was told to me and Tormentcia is the truth.  It isn't worth my time to figure it out.  Valric was guilty on enough other occasions that it really doesn't matter to me that he might have been innocent on one occasion.<br>
<br>
If the government charges someone with 10 crimes, and it turns out that the defendant really only committed 9 of them, I don't get mad at the government.<br>
<br>
You also say the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What you lack in morals you obvioulsy make up for in arrogance. &quot;How dare you plan a raid on VS without consulting me?

The world must really revolve around you doesn't it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Of course, I never actually said any of that stuff.  That's just your interpretation, colored by your apparent loathing for me.  Compare that to what Gorndax had to say on the issue:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Only thing I agree on is that Siilver posted in a way that basically said VS is mine, and didnt contact others or ask if anyone else had intentions to do so. I am one that wont run over someone elses raid, and thus I did not want to say &quot;VS raid, 1 hour before Siilvers&quot;  . <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
All I ever asked for was communication.  Siilverain has now agreed to communicate.  Is that really such a terrible thing?<br>
<br>
If you and Gorndax want to continue hating me and Torm, that's your business.  I'm not losing any sleep over it.<br>
<br>
I've said all that I intend to say on this topic.  I'll let you and Gorndax have the last word if you want it. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

Did you finally figure out that was nowhere near the case and that CBA/VP has tried and continued to try to be civilized and compromising with you?  I have watched a great number of people point out issues they have with you Sage.  Each and every time I have watched you dismiss/ignore the fact that others may feel your wrong and attack them or make excuses out of them.  Maybe you should follow Malambers advice and re-read some of these posts without thinking there is malice meant.  It might help.<br>
<br>
All I ever see from you Sage is continued attempts to have everything done to suit you, if it doesnt you criticize and flame people until you get your way.  That has been said alot more bluntly by many calling you a child/etc.  Some others see that you frequently have valid points but the way you try to get them across usually upsets people.  Please try to not go on the defensive everytime someone disagrees with you, do not ignore what they say or take it in malice.  It might make things better and cause you a little bit less flamage.<br>
<br>
So, know Sage that from everything I have seen you post on these boards, I don't like you.  I expect your response will be "I don't care".  Maybe if you take a little time to be less inflamatory of those of us on the board who dont see things your way. . .We will just disagree with you and not dislike you.  I can respect people who I disagree with, I haven't seen any reason to respect you Sage. <p><b><i>Girolamo Savonarola</b></i><br>

<br>
He was charged one at a time, not all at once.<br>
<br>
If he was charged with 10 crimes at once, I would agree with you.  I would point out however that Valric was tried and yes convicted of many things, and since that particular thread - where he was wrongly accused he hasnt had another thread on him. . .<br>
<br>
*shrug* he was convicted several times, served his sentencing (by getting a bad rep) and learned his lesson, which is apparent from the FACT that he hasnt been accused since.  So you are essentially saying once a criminal always a criminal with your statement.  I disagree with that.<br>
<br>
If I were to take that stance with you, I can see absolutely no reason why you shouldnt be flamed mercilessly until you no longer post because you cant take anymore.  Instead I say how I feel, offer advice of sorts and hope that you might look into the possibilities I raise.  If you do that and become someone better, I will not bring up your previous faults as evidence against you.<br>
<br>
Unless you respond with something, anything, I will have no other choice but to accept your silence as a statement that you feel right or justified in the way you handle everything.  I will at that point think of you as worthless.   Just the way I see you - straight forward and honest. <p><b><i>Girolamo Savonarola</b></i><br>
