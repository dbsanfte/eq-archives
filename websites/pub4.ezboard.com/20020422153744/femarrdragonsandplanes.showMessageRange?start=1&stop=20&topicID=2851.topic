We all think, &quot;it won't happen to us&quot;, I can tell if my group has enough brain power to keep us alive and handle loot properly. I unfortunately thought the same until my experience today. It was my first trip to the ledge, I usually fight with 2-3 people on the floor, but I decided to check it out today. While I am up there, several decent drops come our way, each being asked who will use, and if nobody will use, it is then randomed to the group. <br><br>It was going well, everyone was getting xp, a decent amount of loot was dropping, none of which anyone needed. We rolled everything to those lucky enough to win them. Finally a silver chitin wristband dropped. There were only two melee in the group, myself and a lvl 60 paladin named Intera from Anan Kara. He will referred to from here on as Stupid Bastard, or SB for short.<br><br>Now anyone who knows me also knows that I don't give a damn about loot as much as most people. I'm actually known by the nickname &quot;anti-uber&quot; by friends, because visable holes in my gear. However, when something of this quality comes available and I am one of the only two melee, I have to admit that I was quite estactic at my chances. Siegesmut, our group leader asked who wanted it for their main, if noone, then we random to group. Well, Stupid Bastard immediately pushed for a group random. Why he did so, God only knows because he was the only other melee other than myself there. I stated that I wanted in, that it was a hella upgrade from my dw bracer. Now this is when Stupid Bastard chimes in again, stating:<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;humm friend a pally can t say we wear this one more than DW we have to accept roll to group&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Excuse me Stupid Bastard, but is 1ac too much of a sacrifice for 7str 7dex and 40hp? I think not. The problem I have with this entire ordeal is that some retard thinks he can speak for what would be a better upgrade to my gear. Regardless, before I can respond to this, a group random is rolled. With the god's from lguk smiling upon him, our enchanter won. Juler from League of Ronin was quite firm on where he stood on this when I started questioning the roll in group. He responded with a personal tell:<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I understand where your coming form, and i'm sorry, but that was the way it was rolled, if he gave it to you i wouldn't have minded, but i won it, so i'm not going just going to give it up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but i understand where you are coming from.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I took that as: yeah, you got screwed without any ky to ease the pain, but it benefited me in the end, so tough shit. I even offered to buy the damn thing, but he said he was giving to someone. Someone who wasn't there, who had nothing to do with earning it. I immediately left the group, and filled another slot on my ignore list. I am now drinking a beer.<br><br>Now who is Stupid Bastard to give anything to anybody? He wasn't the leader of the group, he wasn't dual-wielding two pallys and controlling me (thank god), but he spoke over me in the group. What's worse is that everyone went along with it to start, then realized a fuck-up had been made, then did nothing to resolve said fuckup. Stuff like this has happened before, and more honarable people have righted the error, but I guess greed rules all.<br><br>Ojuillean and Chiatae, warm up our spot on the bw, I am coming back.

You get no where telling people they are SoB's and so forth when the group wanted to random it.  It was not my fault that you needed it or could use it.  To many people say they can use it and go off and sell it.  SOme groups are NBG or FFA.  i took this group as a FFA loot.  everythying before was FFA so the bracer was ffa also.  no one else got pissed off until i won it.  Thats what really pisses me off, you get in a group and you know its FFA and then someone really wants something and gets all pissed off when its randomed to the group.  Why are you the only one that was giving a rant and rave in the group? i'm sure everyone would have taKen the bracer.  But i'll let you know something, being an enchanter there is not shit on norrath that i can win unless you raid, so i think everthing should be FFA unless your with a guild.  everyone should get the equal share in getting a piece that drops.  THe group was never NBG of what i understood.  some groups are nbg some are not, and this one was not.  so i'm sorry ya lost the roll, and Intera is not a SoB, Intera has always been a good guy.   And you didnt have to bring the guild names in this, League of ronin or anon kara, i think i and intera can represent ourselves.  Maybe if you want your loot kerna, go raid with your guild.  I said nothing about this, i did not even ask to be in roll but i was. i won, so i'm keeping it.  think most people would understand, but you don't<br><br>Juler 57 chanter of League of Ronin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=roark>Roark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/2/02 5:44:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2851.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Juler,<br><br>If the group was being asked who could use the drops for their main, then randomed to the group if no one spoke up, it WAS a NBG group.

Just think of the poor casters in the group, who if need before greed was always used, would NEVER get to roll on anything. <br><br>Play a wizzy, necro, enchanter etc. and tell me how great nbg is.  NBG is mostly pushed by the ones with the most to gain.  Unless its a class specific item like donals, deepwater etc then all in the group should roll period.  Melee to caster item raito is just pathetic. <br><br>Ask yourself, did you really NEED that bracer?  Probably as much as the item the enchanter may get from trading or selling it.  If I don't know the people in the group, then I will roll on any items I feel aren't really needed by others. <br><br>Also, with all the alts people have, an item won with my enchanter will probably go straight to my paladin.

I believe you said the sb was interla from anam kara.  I stick up for him and get a nice load of rants and flames.<br><br>On a side note:  who said i was bitching about the chanter loot?  I said there isnt shit on norrath to roll on so i agree to FFA.  If you call that bitching, then so be it.  I think the bitching is coming from the person who posted this about not getting what he/she wanted.<br><br>Also, Kerna, the bracer was all yours.  I said nothing in group and you will agree to that.  All the stuff before had been just randomed to the group.  So my understanding was FFA.  And that is why i think Interla said random it throughout the group.  Everyone there seemed to understand, even you said ok.  But soon as i won, all shit broke loose.  And i don't understand where you get off saying i cannot give to my brother for he didnt earn it.  I believe i was there and I did earn it.  I find it funny when being in both NBG and FFA groups.  Both have their faults.  And they are as follows......  In FFA groups everyone has the equal share of the items recieved during the mob destruction.  But when a very nice item drops people start opening their mouths saying  i want i want i need i need.  What is not fair is something can drop that someone can really use.  Then there is NBG.  NBG is great when said this is a NBG group yet people take well advantage of this by saying they will use then next day you see them auctioning it in the commons.  Both have positives and negatives.<br><br>I'm just a little upset about people posting all this shit about me and i have never met ONE of you except girolamno.  Seriously, sometimes i think this game is being taken over with 16 and younger little whiners who have nothing else to do then to rant and flame.  Hell, Kerna never really said anything negative about me besides i kept the bracer.<br><br>Well i kept the bracer and that was what 5/6 of the group wanted and confirmed.<br><br>This will be my last rant and flame post ever.  I'll leave it to you teenagers.  I've stuck up for two people and all i get is bullshit back.  I feel good about sticking up for someone, then i get back here and have 8 posts degrading me. ha, thats bullshit and too bad you don't know me, cause if ya did, you wouldnt be posting your bullshit.<br><br>Juler <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzaazz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaazz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/3/02 1:54:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2851.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More Drama in Velks, Involving a Stupid Bastard.</span><hr size=1> This thread is beating a dead horse, a long dead one.  What's sad is the fact that we all know what drives the economy yet when you run into these horseshit situations someone still gets their feelings hurt.  I read how you quoted Juler, someone I know and like in real life, and I can see him saying that.  He didn't give the &quot;phat lewts&quot; to the sobbing random_grp_member_4.  Also, it may not have been the &quot;moral,&quot; or &quot;kind&quot; thing to do in your opinion...

If this kind of thing bothers you that much I would either like to see it resolved or have you tell me you will accept something of mine to replace whatever you felt you lost that day, and/or maybe what you had hoped to gain by using this poor choice of communication.

Dropping out of a FFA random because you do not need the item and are generous does not automatically make that group suddenly NBG. It just makes that one person generous. Or two.
