Saddam is not a threat to the shores of the US. He is only a threat to our precious oil interests in the Persian Gulf. US policy makers could care less about the people in Iraq. Hell, Shrub even went so far to down play the "War on Terror" by dismissing Osama as a risk or concern. So, do you think Shrub is really all that concerned about a terrorist attack on our shores again? Hardly. He is sabre rattling for ratings. If that means he has to push buttons to the extent that the US launches nukes he will do it. He is a dumb @#%$ drunkard who should be taken out of office before he really starts a world war. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR>Proud Member of <a href="http://magustytalus.tripod.com/">The Order of Magus Tytalus</a><BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/13/02 10:45:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Has Shrub lost his Fvcking mind?!</span><hr size=1>   I think its pretty obvious by now that it is extremely difficult to prove 'beyond a shadow of a doubt' who is responsible for a terror attack.  Afghanistan was the easiest possible target in the world.  Everyone hated them.  Even the Arabs.  But what is going to happen when some terrorist lets a dirty nuke kill everything within one sqare mile of a large city(Thats being modest)  Everyone in the world is going to throw up their arms and say, &quot;OH my God I am soo sorry for you America.  We are all praying for you now.  Let us find who did this and punish them&quot;  Well, if everyone is saying that, then we have no one to punish.  Good luck playing 'fair rules' with these low lifes and getting answers.  The only way to get answers out of these trash' is to threaten them.  Well, since we can't do that(and they know we can't) We might get some sort of nuclear explosion in our country(whether nuclear fallout from a facility, some homemade dirty bomb or an Old timer WW I version.  Obviously, the only reasonably-possible scenario is a dirty nuke which can still kill tens of thousands of people.  The closer we get to these psychos, the more ugent their attacks will become.  IMO, they will attack again, and more than once.  They will always be looking for government targets, commercial targets and energy targets.  They are not reckless and they are not stupid.  They will do their best to hit us very hard next time.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urittdabard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rittdabard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/14/02 6:57:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Has Shrub lost his Fvcking mind?!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm">www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>That is why the Iraqi's hate us. Bushie's poppa talked them into standing up to Saddam and we left them to get steam rolled by an angry Republic Guard. We then hacve the balls to laugh at these people's for how easily they buckled under the largest ariel assault ever on the planet. Iraq does not want a war with us, they just don't want to show us that our bullying tactics aren't going to affect them. However if we do attack them, all parties expect Saddam to unleash all his bio and chem. weapons on Isreal, who will undoubtedly find a way to blame it on the Palestinians. Year one Bush upsets the Chinese whom we had closed gaps during Clinton's administration with results unseen since Nixon's ping pong diplomacy. Year two he helps the Isrealis piss away the camp David accords. In his blind ignorant lust to undo all of Billy's accomplishments do you think he is off to Ireland next year to stir @#%$ up amongst them?<br><br>However Lith has a point, we must strike first at the heart of terror, before it destroys our God created countries way of life. However, since Bush is ignorant, we all know his &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; is a joke. So I have made a list of the true enemies of the American way. I call this the Axis of really really bad, and I expect immediate nuclear strikes.<br><br>1. Florida... Juvenile Delinquents flying planes into buildings, Bay of pigs, every other year some angry cuban refugee tries attacking a boat, Elian, Janet Reno, the dismantling of world series champions, blacks not allowed to vote, hanging chads, butterfly ballots, third leading state in executions, swamp gas the skunk ape, boy bands, Marilyn Manson, retirees getting screwed on realestate deals, abortion clinic shootings, Jeb Bush, scarred manatees,Rosewood, Ted Bundy...face it if you here Florida in the news and it isn't about a college bowl game or a tropical storm its the sound of sanity becoming unhinged. <br><br>2. Texas...mothers drowning kids, Waco, hopped up nurses driving over homeless, cheerleader moms &amp; their hitmen, first in executions, John Rocker works there, coke abbusing pro widerecievers, cattle ranchers vs. Oprah, crazy Mavericks owner, numero uno in pollution, drunken presidential daughters, Secret Service bailing out aforementioned's boytoys, the state that gave us our first first lady to have committed vehicular manslaughter, Enron, rodeos, crazy under-educated religious fundamentalists starting wars for oil, <br>Arid land, people known for traveling by four legged beast, oil, religious fantics, abuse of capital punishment, natives who are recognizable by what they wear on their head, lots of little brown people who spew forth jabberwockey like &quot;please don't shoot me&quot; face  it this place is the middle east in our backyard<br><br>3. Montana...this is kind of my North Korea on the list, sure their offenses aren't as much but they are a scary people who seem like loners compared to the rest of us urbanites. Between the Unabomber and Randy Weaver, though I think they deserve a closer inspection than North Korea which was working on reunifying with the south. I say we need to burn every Montana shack before some crazy starts terrorizing us again.

You have to come up with weapons grade radioactive materials. As it stands now it is not easy to smuggle that @#%$ through the borders or to buy it in the United States. <br><br>I do not agree with the &quot;Strike first&quot; thesis. It is a very dangerous principle akin to &quot;Shoot first, ask questions later&quot;. Besides, what are we supposed to do? Stike each and every country in the world that has weapons (or the technology to produce) of mass destruction? @#%$, let's start with Great Britain then! GB has one of the most successful biological weapons programs in the world. Oh, wait! Have the French stopped pointing nukes at the US? India and Pakistan have rapidly increased their nuclear arsenals and India is well into a biological weapons program. So, fvck-an-a, let's saddle up and strike them all first!

While you think Clinton was weak, he was actually very intelligent and powerful. He worked tirelessly towards a Wilsonian vision of world community were no one nation state is the "Police State", but a coalition of countries accomplish the task. You will find it takes greater strength to build a community than it does to be the Lone Ranger, whipping out a gun, and shooting the "bad guys" all day. But hey, that is the problem with most of us Americans. We prefer to bomb the @#%$ out of a country, then ask questions later. That is being weak. So don't chide Clinton as weak. Real problem solving involves vision, something Bush doesn't have. Just what the hell do you think we are going to do if we go to war with Iraq or North Korea? When the smoke clears and the dust settles, what are we going to do with these countries?<br><br>The people in those countries hate us already! What would we do with them after conquering their nation? Hmmm... seems pretty short sighted to just go off bombing the living s*hit out of people without a plan as to how to fix the problem.<br><br>Maybe the United States government needs to grow some REAL brass balls and allow these countries to govern themselves. I mean, deterence only works against countries, not terrorists. We will never rid the world of terrorism unless we have full cooperation of all the nation states.
