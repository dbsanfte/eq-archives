I think there is some credit to be given to the red cross though... Im sure no one expected so many people to actually give blood the way that they did.<br>

No one who gave blood is worse off than they were before, people are only better off.  So no, people aren't &quot;tools&quot; who gave blood.

But the thing that bothers me and the thing I read into mostly was the fact that they lied to people to get the blood. To me, they took advantage of the American public's sympathy. However, I do feel somewhat relieved that they're not stealing or getting money from this in anyway, and the blood will save lives.<br>

I think you have to look at what things were like for the first week.  Specifically, nobody knew how many people were dead nor how many were injured.  There could have been as many as 50,000 people in each building reportedly, but typically they held about 20,000 each.  I think most people were expecting a lot of serious injuries, unfortunately there were mostly just deaths and minor injuries.  <br>
<br>
It's bad that some of the blood is going to waste, but I don't think anyone should feel cheated.  We should be glad that the Red Cross is brimming over with excess blood supply considering that this war isnt over, and we may yet need those supplies.<br>

<br>
That morning was the first day in my life that I truly felt amazed by how wonderful and perfect my "so called life" really is... considering I knew at that very moment that I was the luckiest person in the world to be able to look over my shoulder and see the treasures that make my life perfect, lying asleep on the couch beside the tv that held images that brought me to my knees... I admit Im a selfish person when it comes to some things.  Donating blood is something I just WONT do.  But that day, there was not one good reason for me not to, and I just couldnt help it.  I will donate all my organs when I die, I will give my bleeding heart to save a child... but I just cant donate blood.  I doubt anything could make me do it again, unless I know its going to save someone that I know, or someone that I know knows (you get the picture)... and hopefully... that will never have to happen.<br>
<br>
I dont have that "one person cant make a difference" attitude... but at the same time... if someone needs my bloodtype -- see my mom or something... I cant do eet!<br>

A lot of people were really hyped on the "omg go donate blood" kick the first few days, and the thought of "are we going to need THIS many people to donate?" did, in fact, cross my mind... but in the same sense seeing everyone doing it and knowing I had the guts to do it too made me feel damn good.

<br>
After selling some of the surplus blood to hospitals, the Red Cross has begun to destroy thousands of pints that have outlasted their shelf life. Directors of several Red Cross blood centers said their sites may discard as many as 1 of every 5 donations and the national total could easily reach tens of thousands.<br>
<br>
The charitable outpouring offered an opportunity for the $2.5 billion-a-year organization to restock its depleted blood inventory. Although the Red Cross told the public that surplus blood would be frozen, it did not have the resources to freeze large amounts of excess blood, according to documents and interviews.<br>
<br>
The Red Cross, which is the nation's largest blood supplier, declined to answer questions about how much extra blood was collected. Spokesmen said the Red Cross kept collecting blood because it did not want to turn away donors and hoped to create a reserve in case of more terrorist attacks. They noted that every blood donation yields some lifesaving byproduct, such as plasma.<br>
<br>
The nonprofit Red Cross collects more than 6 million pints of blood annually and earns about $1.5 billion, or 60 percent of its revenue, by selling donated red cells, platelets and plasma to hospitals for more than $225 a unit. </fontcolor><br>
<br>
You know... the thing that pisses me off is that people gave blood for free and red cross sold it... nice, real nice.  The red cross used the tragedy to make money, and they... more than anyone, should know better.<br>

At least once a week we load a case of flags onto our aircraft that have been donated by businesses back in the US.  During the flight to Afghanistan the loadmasters hang them up inside the aircraft, these flags then fly inside the aircraft as we drop our food over Afghanistan and return.  The flags are folded and then returned home to America where they are GIVEN to people who's family members have been deployed away from home to help fight.  Remember these were donated flags.<br>

<br>
Well, what's the Red Cross's use? Isn't it helping people all around? Most of the folks in the tower died, and really, there were a lot of other donations to their folks, as i understood, so the 200 millions were not needed. That money, as i fondly believe, will help more people and keep the red cross going.<br>
<br>
From a medical point of view, donating blood is good for the donator's health, since it promotes erythropieses (  the synthesis of red blood cells) , and refreshes the blood ( not so medical a term! heh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
So, imho, the process of collecting those donations is a good one, even if it did not go to the advertized cause. Summary:<br>
<br>
1- People felt good for donating to a noble cause.<br>
2- The Red Cross has more fundage to keep going<br>
3- Those who donated will be that bit healthier for it<br>
<br>

Anyone notice you rarely see this kind of bullshit posted on this board about republicans?  I wonder what it is about these boards that attract people like this.  I'm pretty sure it's not a conservative or republican thing, I've met enough of both who are willing to accept that some people just don't see things their way.  What's up with the unprovoked attacks on democrats/liberals? <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>
