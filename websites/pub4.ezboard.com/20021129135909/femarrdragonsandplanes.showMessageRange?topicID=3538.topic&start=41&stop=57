<br>
Except, I don't think insurance rates are based upon tickets involving age/gender groups; only accidents. This is of course my assumption, I could be completely wrong.<br>
<br>
However, I do think that womens lack of accidents has a lot to do with how many more men work than women. A study I saw once said an alarming part of accidents were caused by people speeding to work. So, if more men drive to work than women...it stands to hold some reason.<br>
<br>
Then of course you have my personal problem with the fact it would be morally unconstitutional to raise insurance rates on someone for their race, but it's ok for their gender and age grouping.<br>
<br>
Now, I realize insurance is relative to the amount of risk involved, but there is a large gap between men age 18-25 and women age 18-25 involving insurance rates. For one, women get a tax break at 21, men don't until 23. I think they get another one at 19 from 16, but I'm not quite positive.<br>
<br>
Of course, men pay these exorbiant insurance rates so they can go to work to increase the accident polls to increase the insurance rates ad nausem. It's a vicious cycle.<br>
<br>
And further more, what's up with requiring insurance on people, and then not allowing a government standard. While I agree liability insurance should be a neccesity, it it a moral crime to force people to pay these HUGE rates, without some subsidized alternative.<br>
<br>
I mean, I pay 200 dollars a month for liability because of my age range, and I have some tickets. For liability!<br>
<br>
Bah, I'm done rambling.<br>

I have been pulled over twice for speeding and have been written two tickets (I was as nice as could be and very respectful) one of the tickets was for going 36 in a 35, I got that one thrown out of court.<br>

My sister has been pulled over 5 times (that I know of) for speeding, zero tickets, once she was doing 55 in a 35 construction zone.<br>

You guys DO learn!  And Nekiah, insurance rates do involve moving violations that deduct points from drivers licenses, such as running a stop sign or speeding over 11mph over the speed limit (at least that's the limit in good ol' Georgia).<br>
<br>
My ex-girlfriend (I can call her that now, she told me it was over about 3 days ago) got pulled over for passing on a double yellow - no ticket.  Got pulled over for speeding and a missing headlight - no ticket.<br>
<br>
I get pulled over for an expired tag (2 days expired) and I got a ticket.  I got pulled over for 11mph over (I got lucky) and I got a ticket.<br>
<br>
Then this chick nails me and gets off scott free!  It's the system I tell ya! <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/kyliensigz.jpg"></CENTER>

Oh this is TOO perfect, and it happened yesterday at my friend's work (he works at QuikTrip) and it was on the news!<br>
<br>
Ok so this chick is getting gas at QuikTrip and she fills up and pulls her car up next to the building to pay.  She backs in a spot and leaves the car in reverse, and just puts the E-brake on in her Ford Explorer.  She gets out, takes the brake off and thinks she's in drive, so she hits the gas.  She goes backwards BY MISTAKE and nails the side of the building with the back of her SUV.  Now if this wasn't bad enough...<br>
<br>
there was another lady standing between the back of her car and the building.  She was smashed and died.<br>
<br>
This happened YESTERDAY.  I think it should be illegal for women to drive SUVs. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/kyliensigz.jpg"></CENTER>

People don't understand how dangerous a car can be and take it, more or less, for granted.<br>
<br>
And being a woman, I've seen how easy we can get off for tickets.  I was doing 68 in a 50 and got pulled over.  Then I couldn't find the registration or insurance because I was borrowing my best friend's car.  So after my boyfriend at the time and I fish through all of the crap in her glove compartment for a good 10 min. we finally find the stuff.  The cop just gave me this lecture about how I needed to be safer and he didn't want to give me this 100 and some-odd dollar ticket cuz we teenagers (19 at the time) have better things to do with our money than pay traffic tickets and should be having fun instead.  So he let me go.  I think if it wasn't so late at night and the highway wasn't dead I probably would have gotten a ticket tho.<br>
<br>
And while most of my road rage is directed at @#%$ male drivers, both of the accidents I've been in were cause by females.  Yay, going on the third car in 2.5 years....I'm cursed!<br>

I've already been smacked in the chest by a close friend for making fun of her soccer mom-ishness (minivan, soccer ball ornament dangling from her rearview, soccer ball decal on her rear windshield, scares the hell out of me when she drives...), yet I still can't seem to quit making fun of women drivers. &nbsp;I think it's because so many of them come close to running over me (or do they do that because I make fun of them?).<br>

In all seriousness, I personally know both men and women who have been involved in accidents, but the only lethal ones were caused by idiotic male drivers (drunk, stoned, showing off, not paying attention, offensively driving, etc.). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughiastormwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghia Stormwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/19/02 7:24:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3538.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who the hell's idea was it to give women driver's licens</span><hr size=1> When I was coming from Denver down through Nebraska last month I was zipping along at about 90 something (I don't remember exactly)  I come over a hill there's a cop so I hit the brakes get the speed down so I am only clocked at 86mph.  Pull over can't find the registration (plates are current) I haven't gotten the new insurance card into the car yet....can't find my driver's license.  So I give him the old insurance card (it's 3 days out of date and the car is new so clearly still has to have full insurance) tell him my license number (I know it from memory)  and I get a speeding ticket for 84  (he cut it down from 86 for me).  <br>
<br>
I did manage to find the registration before he handed me the ticket.<br>
<br>
Yeah Im a girl.  =p  <br>
<br>
I haven't managed to get in any accidents since I was 16 when I ran a stop sign and got hit by someone who was driving with thier headlights off.  But it was a soccer mom type that hit me...... <p>

IMO being a woman has nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
Speak directly and be calm, And 99% of the time<br>
you will not even recieve a ticket.<br>
<br>
Police are like us all. Just Reg Folks doing their best.<br>
<br>
I have never recieved a ticket for a moving violation..<br>
I would say Mostly because I am direct and honest,<br>
And I do not give them any BackTALK... Get it ?<br>

<br>
Statistics based on observation is not the same as Sexism...<br>
<br>
It may have been poorly worded, but Female (especially teenage female) drivers tend to be horrific drivers. <br>
<br>
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL WOMEN ARE BAD DRIVERS<br>
<br>
But its means that a large percentage of women drivers are sub-par. And Maybe YOU aren't a bad driver... good for you, but that doesn't make up for all the dumbasses around you that are giving you a bad name.<br>
<br>
For once why doesn't someone @#%$ do something about the problem rather than bitching about the people that are observing the problem because they are not being politically correct?<br>
<br>
Politically Correct is a joke these days in any case... Waiting hours in an airport because Racial Screening is so terrible is not the way to be doing things.<br>
<br>
No, I don't think all &lt;insert race here&gt; are terrorists, but narrowing down a small percentage of the population to aid their search instead of being indiscriminating with searches (just an example) when they could be more effective with racial, sexial, age-oriented (fakk is that a word?) and other kinds of screenings is stupid.<br>
<br>
Hell for one thing, it would make airports faster for everyone. Not just those who didn't have to be searched.<br>
<br>
But Hey! thats what i think, how about you? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=180420> Elaen</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 506<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/19/02 10:01:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3538.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTF?!</span><hr size=1> I don't know any studies on &quot;bad&quot; driving, but statistically the most <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> dangerous</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> drivers (most likely to be involved in accidents - especially serious/fatal ones) on the road are young men.<br>

A police officer pulled a guy over for speeding and the following exchange took place:<br>
Officer: May I see your driver's license?<br>
Driver: I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my 5th DUI.<br>
Officer: May I see the owner's card for this vehicle?<br>
Driver: It's not my car. I stole it.<br>
Officer: The car is stolen?<br>
Driver: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's card in the glove box when I was putting my gun in there.<br>
Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?<br>
Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed<br>
the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk.<br>
Officer: There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?<br>
Driver: Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
Hearing this, the officer immediately called his captain. The car was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver to handle the tense situation:<br>
<br>
Captain: Sir, can I see your license?<br>
Driver: Sure, here it is ... It was valid.<br>
Captain: Who's car is this?<br>
Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card ... The driver owned the car.<br>
Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a gun in it?<br>
Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it ... Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.<br>
Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in it.<br>
Driver: No problem ... Trunk is opened; no body.<br>
Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.<br>
Driver: Yeah, and I'll bet he told you I was speeding, too! <p>----------------------------------<br>
