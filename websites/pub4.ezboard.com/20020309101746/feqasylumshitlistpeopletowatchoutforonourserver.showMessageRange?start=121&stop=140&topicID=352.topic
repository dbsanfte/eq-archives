Just a thought, maybe we could even vote on what posts to put in the hall of shame, now, all of them would of course be locked threads so that they can't be responded to just read to keep us posted on the people who we all love to hate.<br>

Though I must say, Binidin is one ABUSIVE beggar, and he's still level 13, and still around. Not to mention, twinked to the gills.<br>
<br>
Shitlistable? Well I dunno. I certainly would like knowing about him, even if I hadn't met him first.<br>
<br>
Maybe move this to rants?<br>

I would suggest that as a rule begging not be placed here unless it is taken to extremes with verbal abuse, or other harrassment ( as MANY have reported here ).  <br>

Yes, Beggers are not exactly an extreme rarity. I think Begging shouldn't be allowed on here, but Like everyone said. sometimes they go too far with their responses to your &quot;no&quot; well How about Beggging is not allowed on here. But Harrassment is I think that's alot better and You can add the begging thing in if you feel he did that as well. But shitlisting someone for begging.

You just managed to look silly , by allowing your younger brother who is level 25 to come on a dragon raid and beg for dragon loot, while complaining you have no control over him.<br>

Normally, begging..even incessant begging..wouldn't warrant being on the SL.  However, this player not only refused to take a no, he also turned abusive and foul for prolonged periods when denied, and because of that, I think he should remain.  He has consistently acted without honor for a considerable amount of time, and that does warrant a warnng to the Lanys community imho. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uultimikik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ultimikik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/22/01 1:25:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Leave or lock/delete</span><hr size=1> &quot;DELETE THIS IDIOTIC POST PLEASE!<br>
..simply statede 90% of people that are now 50+ begged as a newbie. it's something character's just get rid of as they grow older in levels and experience. NOT SHITLIST MATERIAL.<br>
I begged as a newbie. i used to stake out banks and ask for 20pp to every person. i made ALOT of money. This guy is probably no longer on lanys. or has started a new character. if you ignore them instead of acting stupid and ooc'ing omg this newbie is a begger. they will leave you alone. <br>
GRANTED that sometimes there is horrible beggers. One lvl 6 kept recking my kites and annoying me so much. i solved it MYSELF though instead of /petitioning or bringing it to this list. I tp'ed him to dreadlands and left him.<br>
I'd like to express my appreciation for the lanys moderators altering the rules for this list. you've made it better *nod*<br>
but allowed this Bullshit post to stay up is wrong.<br>

 They're may be Personal exceptions to Shitlisting people, Like Binidin which I had not known how &quot; Evil and Corrupted&quot; a Begger this person is. But notice &quot;NOT SHITLIST MATERIAL&quot; I stated there it was not shitlist material, Why? Notice ahead how I do not defend Binidin at all. I simply state Begging in itself Isn't shitlistable. It isn't The only people who have problems with these type of people are people who don't know how to ignore or petition or report. So they take it to the shitlist, Which is meant to be a Punishment for that person. Not a warning to others, because if you think people don't have the common sense to know what a person is about after they say &quot; HAVE ANY MONEY FOR ME&quot; ...well I feel sorry for them. I've heard so commenly in ooc. &quot; What ya gonna do about it!&quot; &quot; I'll shitlist you!&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .

llorian, Do you have a  brother? Do you have a Sister?<br>
<br>
Imagine how I feel. I'm on a Nagafen raid, Haven't done one thing wrong Die a few times come out of the raid fine.<br>
Then come to lanys to read someone Posting my character is lacking because I didn't Discipline my brother, Instead of posting that my brother is not a Nice play by the rules player and Is a pain in the ass. Which I wouldn't have defended like I did here. <br>
You have some fucked up morals if you would pick Shutting off your brother's Computor Over a Few people That you don't know. Although Im finding I'm not surprised to find people like you. My friend's Own grandpa Just died and His grandma Changed the will of their house so that she could have Some money in her pockets and they are Houseless now.<br>

<br>
Um yes if my sister would act like your brother did, I'd talk to her, and if she wouldn't stop you can bet I'd turn off the computer.  And if you don't know a person, does that mean they don't deserve respect? Is it ok to behave like an ass to people you don't know?  Sorry you are the one with fucked up morals.  I know CC, and I think that she deserves respect, which your brother did not display.  Apologizing for others doesn't fix the problem, but it does show that you do not condemn their behavior and is trying to fix it.  If you don't have any influence on your brother, its another story, but it sounds like you simply don't care about what he does.<br>

Not life, therefore to me Real life events and people matter more to me then this game.<br>
I'm sorry a few of you don't have your own life and therefore rely on everquest to be your life.<br>
As far as im concerned with &quot;Cc&quot; I did respect her alot. She lost that respect when she blamed my brothers actions on me instead of my brother.<br>
90% of people Begging is false statement I see now. However, that does not mean that ALOT of people do not beg. I know many people that do and did. My morals are not ruined at all. My character is not wrong at all. Why? because My morals are REAL LIFE morals. Not those that are developed from a game.<br>
Far as you, or I know CC could be a hairy man who just killed two people( an example, Most likely not the truth). That's why I chose to respect my brothers, friends, and family members before I respect others on game. <br>
As I have said many times in the past, which i can see you all chose to ignore. I did Advise my brother not to do it. I did tell hiim the recourse of his actions and what would happen. But As far as shutting off the computor, he would turn it right back on. Now, If your going to flame me. try to make some sense at least and not make yourself look like a retard. The ONLY course of action that I can see that would of actually stopped my brother would be to beat him. but I think alot of your morals might say that's ok?<br>
