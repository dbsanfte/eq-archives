The sooner we in Europe distance ourselves from lunatic bellicose 'Merkin policy the better, in my opinion. Hopefully Tony Bliar and the rest will treat President Shrub's &quot;Principled Leadership&quot; (As &quot;Voice of reason&quot; Colin Powell cautions) with the utter derision it deserves.&quot;<br>
<br>
Had to make a couple of comments on this.<br>
<br>
Imperialist Roistering?  We learned from the best: The Nations of Europe (You have absolutley no proof of this anyway).<br>
<br>
Genocidal Despots?     We learned from the best: The Nations of Europe (When was the last time we could be accused of this? Iran and the Shah?  Over 20 years ago?  How far do we go back to accuse other nations of the same thing?)<br>
<br>
It's is amusing that Europe's stepchild, America, is not expected to act in the very same way all of them acted throughout their history, and only because they don't have the power anymore to do the very same thing they claim we are doing.<br>
<br>
As I have mentioned before, and will bring up again, I love it when someone in a foreign land criticizes our leader and tells us we shouldn't have elected them, because it goes against what THEY think we should be doing.<br>
<br>
I have news for you, you operate in your own best interests and we do too.  To expect any otherwise is ignorant on your part.<br>
<br>
If anyone is going to be treated with utter derision, it is nations that show us no respect, but yet everytime the chips are down, come crying to us for money and relief.  And people wonder why we constantly are having isolationist movements.<br>
<br>
It is best summed up with this old saying, &quot;Don't bite the hand that feeds you&quot;.<br>

   Then the sooner we can stop rushing over to save your sorry behinds.  I spent 7 fun filled months in Bosnia because Europe lacks the power to stop a few thousand Serbs. (and 4 years before that to save you all from the Godless Commie Hordes)  <br>
    Some how, I really cannot imagine The Serbs being a threat to any one out side Europe, but it was decided some one had to stop the killing, and God knows the Europeans can’t. <br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
However, if it's deemed that the US wishes to take the attitude of &quot;we are who we are, punch us and we will beat the shit out of you&quot;...<br>

   I can live with that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We tried the nice guy approach, got us 4,000 killed. If it takes killing every terrorist we find, invading every country that harbors terrorist, and telling Israel “go ahead and take over the Mid-East, we’ll rather buy  oil from you any way” to stop another attack, then that’s fine with me. Only 4 more &quot;days&quot; on the night shift, maybe working days will improve my additude. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

  As a side note, I love it when some country with a military the size of the New Jersey National Guard tell the USA they will not support our invation of the next country on our hit list. Like we need their help any way. 50% of the world military spending gives you a ass-kick'n military that can take out Iran with or with out Lower Slovina's help.<br>

Serbo-Croatia was a UN thing - you know little organisation based in New York.....<br>
<br>
As was Gulf War - seem to recall most of civilised world took part in that one....<br>
<br>
as for the commie hordes.... I believe I am right in saying that that was a USA decision made during the 1950's..... as we support our allies, we had to back it up....<br>
<br>
and if you compare the recent military campaigns that say the British and the Americans have been involved in, say the last 40 years, I think you will find we have done rather better....<br>
<br>
yes we are a small country, and yes we happen to have a small armed force - and yes our equipment generally sucks.... but man for man we still outfight you - why else would the SAS be requested as a top priority by the pentagon when ever anything kicks off.... the US even got so pissed off with the Brits winning the Curtis LeMay trophy they made it USA only.... <p><center>

I believe you mean NATO, UN didn't do shit. Until after NATO started.<br>
<br>
The UN rarely does actual military operations until another invovled country does something first.<br>

Assuming your British, yeah, you held your own during WW2. <br>
<br>
Your equipment sucks? rofl, your going to make me wet myself with laughter.<br>
<br>
As far as fighting harder goes, well I'm not gonna say much about that. You guys held out against the Nazi's for 2 wars, but we(america) were the deciding factor in both wars.<br>
<br>
Not to mention while we assisted you in WW2 we also fought a war in the Pacific.<br>

In the 5 years they were deployed to Bosnia they were ignored by the combatants when convenient, and taken hostage on a regular basis. A Dutch Infantry Battalion was tasked with protecting a Muslim “Safe Area” as declared by the UN. The Serbs just walked in a killed around 5,000 Muslim men and boys, the Dutch/UN just stood there and did nothing. (the Serbs were polite enough to take the Muslims out in the woods before killing them) <br>
   NATO shows up, with the US Army General publicly stating he is ready to fight the Serbs at any time, and the bloodshed ends. <br>
  BTW, my comments disparaging the Europeans militaries do NOT include the Brits. (The Germans are also great, but political considerations stop them from doing much) <br>
In my mind the Brits are definably uber. I was stationed with the British for about 4 months and love it. Most of the British I talked to did not consider them self’s as part of Europe.<br>
   Lol, I know one look at the map will show how silly the idea seems, but they took great pains to distance them self from the land mass to the South East of them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
  My only complaint about the British is trying to understand them some time. How can a fairly small area have so many accents??  And my god, trying to understand a Scot on the phone who is excited is blood hard to do.

In the longer version of my intended earlier post, I could only fathom them saying &quot;Now now, that's not very nice&quot; for a maximum of TWO years.<br>
<br>
I guess that even in criticism I'm too optimistic.<br>
<br>
The problem with the UN high foreheads is that they don't allow the peacekeepers to... well... peacekeep. The poor troops can't even defend themselves.<br>
<br>
Its as though the UN's idea of a good attack is to issue a statement along the lines of:<br>
<br>
&quot;We're not very happy that you slaughtered thousands of people, so we're going to give you a black mark on your grade sheet, look at you with a stern expression, and wag a finger at you! Ha ha! You will crumble beneath the weight of our merciless symbolic gesticulations!&quot;<br>
<br>
And then they'd go off and issue another statement that Israel and Palestine need to get along better, AIDS is a bad thing, and celebrate when Kofi Annan gets another Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to humanity.<br>

Not much to speak of in the water or in the air.<br>
<br>
The U.S. decided (with the suggestion of its allies) that the European theater was more important.  So, most of our equipment went there.  If we had concentrated on the Japanese theater, we probably could have had that wrapped up by the end of 1943.  They were basically on the run by then.<br>
<br>
And we pretty much could have been guaranteed little to no help on an invasion of Japan.<br>
<br>
We were basically fighting a two front war and winning on both fronts. You know, the very thing our allies asked us to get Germany to do,  Germany couldn't fight on two fronts, but we could.<br>
<br>
My objective is not to look down upon any of our allies, but when their anti-U.S. rhetoric gets in the way of at least being respectful to a country who has helped them out in so many ways since the early 1900's, I get a little incensed.  <br>
<br>
I don't think we were running around complaining about the way England went into Argentina and the Falklands.  It was right, we knew it was right, and we supported it.  That is all we ask in return.<br>

  I gave a class last year in Peacekeeping operations and one of the topics covered was the difference between UN and US lead operations. To illustrate my point, I displayed a photo of a UN patrol and a US army patrol in Bosnia.  The UN Patrol had a HUGE blue flag up front and every one was walking in a file. (With baby blue helmets no less)<br>
  The US army patrol was walking tactically with full armor and weapons. There was no doubt; the UN was using its “moral authority” as its main weapon. While the USA was using massive firepower, and the knowledge that if you screwed with this patrol, the heavens would open up and rain fire on you. <br>
    My students were also able to pick out what patrol was more likely to be held hostage and what patrol would be left alone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

re the far east side of ww2 - we did have a few ships.... but those craft sobs slapped us hard.... at the outbreak of ww2 we - i think - had the largest navy - but the imperial japanese navy and the kreigsmarine soon sorted us out.....<br>
<br>
air wise, we did dominate the land war - we went through burma etc - while the yanks went through the pacific - it worked - lets all be thankful...<br>
<br>
land wise, there were many antipodeans involved - but the brits were more - so much so that they called themselves the forgotten army as all seemed to have forgotten they existed... yes i am being defensive, but one of those great teachers who influenced my life was a chindit - and i will always respect him and what he stood for.....<br>
<br>
yes the UN is a bunch of pansies - if only they would get a little heavier sooner......<br>
<br>
and i assume the parrot had beautiful plumage? <p><center>
