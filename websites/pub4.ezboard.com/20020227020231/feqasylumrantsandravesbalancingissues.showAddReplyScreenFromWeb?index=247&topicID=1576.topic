<br>
&quot;Proof&quot; offered by Harabec. Well, I followed the links. The UARk link had one glaring fallacy. Paul was not an Apostle. Paul was a convert after Christ died. The second link led to a discourse on verifying the infallibility of the written word. <br>
<br>
Ok. Let's accept the Christian Bible is not only mostly historically correct, but absolutely correct. <br>
<br>
Christ teaches his disciples to gather together to worship. <br>
<br>
But modern &quot;Christians&quot; don't feel the need to worship with others, it interferes with their &quot;personal understanding of God&quot;. <br>
<br>
Christ teaches his disciples to partake of communion, and to do so in memory of him.<br>
<br>
Modern &quot;Christians&quot; don't feel the need to partake of communion. It's not really necessary to have that &quot;personal relationship with God&quot;. <br>
<br>
Christ teaches his disciples he is the Living Word. The Word made flesh. <br>
<br>
But the Word, the Bible, doesn't have to be accepted in toto, only what you agree with and accept. <br>
<br>
Hmmmm, I'm starting to understand now. You are what you call yourself, simply because you decide that is what you are. If you consider yourself a Christian, you are one.<br>
<br>
Okay. That makes it perfectly clear to me.<br>
<br>

<br>
Where exactly are you getting this information from?  There are many different denominations with different beliefs.  I don't know of any Christian that doesn't talk about God or Worship together.  An example of worshiping together is Church.<br>
<br>
[q] Christ teaches his disciples to partake of communion, and to do so in memory of him.<br>
<br>
Modern &quot;Christians&quot; don't feel the need to partake of communion. It's not really necessary to have that &quot;personal relationship with God&quot;. [/q]<br>
<br>
Umm, at my church we have communion regularly to symbolize the crucifixion and the only means through which we are saved.  There may be some churches that don't, but then again I don't know of all other denominations.<br>
<br>
[q] Christ teaches his disciples he is the Living Word. The Word made flesh. <br>
<br>

<br>
This may be true of some Christians, but definately not all of us.  I agree and accept everything in the Bible.  Some of the teachings are harder to understand then others and must be studied to determine the interpretation.  People can look at the same thing and interpret it a different way.<br>
<br>
BTW, Paul was considered an Apostle, I believe the Bible referred to him as such a number of times.  It takes a change in the heart to turn to believing, so nothing I say or anyone else says will change you unless there is a change inside.  /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zistin>Zistin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 5:33:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=249>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.houston.rr.com/rards/downloads/timbo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> I take it back, Sijand...you are an jerk, if only for this statement:<br>

Anyway, I still have yet to see one single person answer the question I've painstakingly repeated with horrified wonder since my very first post: Where is the rightness, the appropriateness, of deigning to try and tear down someone else's belief system, insultingly, and then try and ingratiate your own beliefs onto them as part of that process? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usijandistraightarrow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sijandistraightarrow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 6:41:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=250>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> Rivlas, thank you for a meaningful post.<br>
<br>
Zistin, when you refuse to accept standard definitions for belief systems, ideologies, etc. you merely place yourself on another plane. Just because you call yourself a Christian and identify with some of the beliefs of a Christian doesn't make you a Christian.<br>
<br>
As for anyone responding to your question, Zistin, I believe it's been done several times. You just don't want to deal with that portion of the discussion. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where is the rightness, the appropriateness, of deigning to try and tear down someone else's belief system, insultingly, and then try and ingratiate your own beliefs onto them as part of that process?&quot;  (...of deigning...? you'll have to explain the use of that word in this context, doesn't make much sense to me)<br>
<br>
You profess to be Christian, and have stated you respect the beliefs of others, but say they are wrong. Your &quot;Christian&quot; belief is the only right one, it even says so in the scripture. How is this any different from someone non-religious saying the same thing? I respect your right to hold your own beliefs, but they're wrong. Someone mentioned pot and kettle. Seems just as appropriate from this end.<br>
<br>
I resort to sarcasm when there is no longer any  point in trying to hold a civil discussion. Trying to be civil while repeatedly being lumped in with flamers and foot-in-the-mouth morons doesn't set well on this end either.  <br>
<br>
So far as I'm concerned, anyone having the gall, audacity and egotism to claim they know the answers to life and existence, when they don't even know the basics of the religion they claim to be a part of, doesn't deserve civility. To me you are no different than the &quot;Moslem&quot; terrorists who attacked our country. They didn't accept all the tenets and precepts of Islam. They felt they could twist and distort the beliefs they were taught to suit their own needs. <br>
<br>
This has been the hallmark of religion since the earliest days of man. In my opinion, religion is corrupt by it's very nature. Religious people may have done many great things, but that speaks of the people, not the religion. I believe, based on all I've studied in my short lifetime, that organized religions are responsible for more human death and bloodshed than any other cause throughout history.<br>
<br>
&quot;Christians&quot; came to this country and promptly started practicing genocide against the native peoples, because they were &quot;godless savages&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Christians&quot; had no problem enslaving some people merely because of their national origin/ethnicity.<br>
Of course, man has made this a practice since the dawn of time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Christians&quot; at one point in this country's history accomplished Prohibition of Alcohol. That was a really good move, look at all the gangsters and violence that resulted. The same mindset is what got marijuana and other drugs prohibited also. This country used to be quite different than it is now in many aspects. Laws against gambling, liquor sales on Sunday, age limits for alcohol consumption...the list is very long. Then there are the laws establishing the tax exempt status of religious organizations. Simply put, the rest of the country is shouldering the burden which the churches have been exempted from, this means I pay indirectly to support those churches in this country. With all the talk of school vouchers, non-religious people will end up shouldering the burden for the education of the children of religious parents.<br>
<br>
The proposed law in Washington is just another example of religious opposition to education. Real education. Not the repetition of fairy tales passed down, regardless of how accurately the stories have been repeated. Repeating a lie accurately is still a lie.<br>
<br>
For those of you who demand validation of your beliefs, not just the right to have them, when you accept the beliefs of others as just as valid as your own you can expect acceptance. So long as you continue to deny beliefs of others, you can't expect others to accept yours. I don't expect anyone to accept my beliefs, they are between creation/existence and myself. I will continue to feel free to disregard anyone else's opinion in this matter, especially those who cannot maintain an intelligent discussion.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry there were so many flamers in this thread, a lot of good discussion ensued here. When you reach the point that discussion is pointless it's time to quit. My remarks in my last post might have been tactless, but many comments directed to me have been also so I don't feel badly about it.<br>
<br>
I stand by what I said, take it any way you want to. <br>

Well, let's call them shall we? <br>
<br>
Paul being an apostle: Rivlas is correct, most Christian denominations that I know of, anyway, do consider St. Paul to be an apostle.  His conversion came after Jesus' death, however he did join the apostles, lived with them, debated with them, worshipped with them, then began his journey abroad to spread the Word and establish Churches.<br>
<br>
Calling yourself a Christian doesn't make yourself one (if  you dont worship with others, take communion, etc, etc):  Last I checked, there were over 20,000 divisions of Protestant Christianity alone.  Then you've also got the Roman Catholic Church, the various Orthodox Churches on top of those.  Within all these divisions, you have an extremely varied interpretation of how to follow Christ, how to worship, whether or not the bible is literally correct or not, whether communion is merely symbolic or the true embodiment of Christ, whether the bible is the last word of god or whether Tradition or private revelation  are divinely given, how to interpret scripture, etc, etc.  Hell, even the apostles had debates over these things, they even debated whether one had to be circumcised or not to be considered a Christian (you might finally open the bible Sijandi, and find out the answer to that one, as its pretty clear you haven't studied scripture beyond learning the basic bible stories of the Flood, the Nativity, and the Crucifixion, and that probably when you were a kid).  The point is Christianity takes a wide variety of forms, but the basis of being able to call one's self a Christian, the common denominator, seems to be a belief that Jesus Christ is the savior, and a desire and attempt to live one's life according to his teachings.  The teachings are what are open to interpretation, some will hold them to every one of them quite literally, others will interpret them more broadly, some will apply more importance to some than others, some groups do not believe Jesus was the actual son of God but that he was still the savior, some believe in the Trinity others do not, some believe you have to attend church every week to keep the sabbath, others believe that a private worship of God and prayer will suffice, some believe in infant baptism others do not, some denominations interpret the bible quite literally and believe that the earth is 6000 or so years old, others will accept the basic premise of evolution but will see God's hand in it... Who are you to say any of these people are not Christians?  If they profess a belief in Christ and his teachings, then in my book, they are Christians, no matter what outward form their worship of Him takes so long as they are trying to follow His example.  You accuse Harabec and Zistin of being close-minded and thinking others have the wrong way, but you are far, far worse, you think you can say who is and who isnt a Christian, and what is required to be a Christian, when not only do you have a profound lack of respect for Christianity, but you show a REMARKABLE lack of understanding of any of the basics of ANY of the major Christian denominations or the bible.  You are EXACTLY what you accuse religious people of being.  You're a close minded, non-thinking elitist sheep who, armed with only a MINISCULE amount of actual facts, tosses out blatant lies, evasive half-truths, and broad generalizations to dismiss the viewpoints of millions of other people.  You sir, are a hypocrite of the worst sort, and embody everything you profess to hate about Christians.<br>

Substitute &quot;political institutions&quot; for religion and I think you would be much, much closer to the truth here.<br>

Also, my citation of great Catholic minds was not done to credit the religion for their great works -- I offered their existence and their achievements to disprove what you stated earlier about religion forcing people to not question and study and investigate.  These were all religious people.. and not just in name only. Hell, Lemaitre was a *priest*, held closer to the laws and teachings of the Church than a layperson, and he developed the Big Bang theory.  Yes, these were individual achievements, not religious ones - but if the Church and religion were as you say, none of their achievements would have been possible.<br>

Christians also came to this country and lived peacefully with the Native people - ever hear of the Quakers?  They were also, along with the Catholic church, quite active in the abolition movement, and in participating in the underground railroad.  Just one example for you.  Slavery did not originate with Christianity.  The largely a-religious ancient greek and roman societies practiced slavery in a particularly harsh form.  Contrast this with the practice of slavery among very religious ancient Jews, who stood out for their compassionate practice freeing any slave that was mistreated or abused in any way.<br>
<br>
Why dont you put a *some* in front of the term Christians.  SOME Christians came here and even persecuted other Christians.  The puritans persecuted, most notably, those who were Church of England, Roman Catholics, and Quakers.  Those who were CofE mostly stayed to the more liberal climate of Boston while the puritans maintained settlements in Salem area, Plymouth area, etc.  Quakers tended to keep themselves to themselves, as the Puritans had it in for them as well.  Catholics faced persecution from both puritans and CofE, and tended to keep to themselves, many went to Rhode Island which, because of Roger Williams and others, had a more religiously liberal atmosphere, as well as further places like Maryland that were certainly more tolerant towards all.<br>
<br>
SOME people persecute others.  Its not religion that is responsible for this, its human nature.  Religion is ONE TOOL that the cruel have and can use to persecute others.  This is unfortunate, and obviously a perversion of all that is good in religion.  But it is by NO means the only tool available for the unjust to wield power over others.  As I said earlier, substitute &quot;political institutions&quot; for &quot;religion&quot; and I think your statement about religion being responsible for all sorts of ills becomes MUCH closer to truth.  There's a ton of other ways to enable persecution, religion is just ONE and it doesn't invalidate religion any more than substituting &quot;political institutions&quot; invalidates the concept of having a government to maintain order and organization in a nation.<br>

Frankly, the only people I have seen in this thread making these kinds of demands, are you, and the anti-religion bandwagoneers.  Why dont you drop the polite veneer you're trying to maintain, Sijandi, and say what you really think.  You may not type in ALL CAPS D00D and use swear words, but underneath your sneeringly polite exterior I bet you're seething with anger and disgust at the religous folk just like the other ignorant and immature flamers on your side.  Go ahead, let it all out - I bet you're just dying to start SHRIEKING AND SCREAMING AND TEARING YOUR HAIR OUT and saying OH MY GOD HOW IGNORANT AND BLIND THESE GOD DAMN CHRISTIANS ARE OMG OMG OMG!~!@$#@<br>

Returned to worship in Church of Christ at age 25.<br>
Studied with and taught young teens and adults, ran the bulletin, was a member of the adult study group. During this period of time my father became a minister in the CoC.<br>

<br>
They say that religious folks dont want to take the bad with the good -- but in my experience, most freely admit it.  Now perhaps they should look at themselves, reverse their accusation, and do the same.<br>
<br>
And Sijandi, attending a church does not necessarily mean you've looked at that religion, or any other, or the bible closely.  And frankly, from some of the blantantly wrong things you've said in this thread, I'm pretty shocked to hear that you taught religious classes -- I wonder what misinformation you helped give to the people who came to you for instruction.<br>
<br>
But, if I take what you say at face value, then my response to you would be -- if you have all this understanding you say you do, why not use it in this thread, instead of avoiding issues or trying to skirt them with generalizations?<br>

I probably should have waited to post until I calmed down, but I replied to the post, as I read it, and once I got to that bullshit of being called a terrorist by my own right, and assigned a ghost-hand in their behavior and actions, I pretty much lost my rationality and civility, and had to vent.  Honestly, I'm so mad now, I would like to put my hand through the wall to relieve some of the stress from such utter contemptuous bullshit, but instead I put it into posting, which I probably should not have.

Most modern &quot;Christians&quot; pick and choose what they decide they will consider part of their faith based on what is most convenient for them. Basic rules of the religion are ignored because they don't coincide in what a particular person thinks is best for themself.<br>
<br>
There is a huge list of things that could not be considered &quot;Christ-like&quot; that many so-called Christians do under the pretense that it isn't part of their religious beliefs. Anything ranging from fornication to drug use, cursing to having an actively gay sex life. Not that I, personally, have any problems with any of those. But if you call yourself Christian and do any of the things Christians aren't supposed to do, there's really only one word for you: Hypocrite. <p><center>

Some Churches fall in between, and say homosexuality is a sin like taking the Lord's name in vain, or I dunno, not keeping the sabbath, but it is no worse a sin than any other and that gays should be treated no differently than any other people (after all everyone is a sinner).  So its very hard to establish any one set of rules as to what Christians are &quot;supposed&quot; to do.<br>
<br>
Further, no matter what list of things a particular denomination considers as &quot;must do's&quot; and &quot;must not do's&quot;, if someone fails to do them or commits a sin, this is exactly the person the religion is FOR.  As Jesus states in the bible, he came FOR the sinners.  Christians dont believe God expects them to be perfect.  Christians aren't supposed to believe they ARE perfect.  Christians are imperfect like all people, and believe God KNOWS this about them.  The thing is they are supposed to TRY not to sin, and to ask forgiveness when they fail.  They aren't expected to be perfect.  That's the whole point of the crucifixion and the resurrection, that Christ died for the sinners, which is all of us, as no man is perfect.<br>
<br>
I would agree that there are Christians who are hypocrites, of course, and I'm sure most Christians would agree with you as well.  People who know what they are doing is wrong, but put up a false front and pretend they are righteous and pure are not exclusive to Christianity though.  You will find people of this type in any religion, including your own.  Again, this is a failing of human beings - not a failing of religion or Christianity in particular.<br>

You have something called the Bible. It outlines a great many things that you should or should not do if you wish to worship the god of Abraham. I don't recall reading anywhere in there that you could pick and choose which ones you liked and which ones you were gonna ignore. Just because your &quot;demonination&quot; decides they aren't going to follow one of the rules doesn't make them right. They are just as wrong as individuals who choose to do the same.<br>
<br>
That better? <p><center>

<br>
In any case, viewing religion as I do, I would say if what they are doing helps them to greater spiritual understanding, and hurts no one, then I dont care if they call it Tyrialisism.  Form is nothing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueqloots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqloots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/30/02 11:54:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1576.topic&index=266>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Banning evolution: It's the Law....</span><hr size=1> /thinks all people who think they have the right to judge me on my spiritual beliefs or who uses the bible to condem people can GO TO HELL!!! <br>

 Glad to see every one have beliefs and such and discuss them openly however if you think for one damn second that you are better then some one just because of your beliefs....i can honestly judge you as a pathetic person<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
See, part of the whole &quot;Christ-is-my-savior&quot; deal is that if you do bad things, you ask for forgiveness and don't do them again. The Bible outlines a WHOLE bunch of stuff you're not supposed to do. Things that are relatively acceptable nowadays in our culture. But just because everyone else does it doesn't mean a good Christian should.<br>
<br>
So you do it. You take a hit off the bong, or you fuck that cute waitress from the bar, or you say &quot;God damn it,&quot; or you fudge on your tax returns, or you hold a grudge against your neighbor because his dog crapped in your yard, or you let that guy suck your dick because, hey, it's not really intercourse! All these little things that you're not supposed to be doing as a Christian. But you are. And you keep doing them. Over and over again.<br>
<br>
How many times do you think you're supposed to be forgiven? You think your God is stupid or something? It cracks me up how Christians are always talking about their &quot;all-knowing, all-seeing&quot; God and then expecting to get away with shit he doesn't want them doing.<br>
<br>
Religion isn't flexible. It isn't something to be redefined to suit your needs or to be convenient for you. And when you try to, you insult the beliefs of those <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> few</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> who actually do adhere to the tenets of the faith when you try to put yourself in the same category as them.<br>
<br>
Not my place to police bad Christians. I'm just pointing out that most of you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bad Christians. Getting all defensive and insulting isn't going to change that. The only thing that will is YOU, by changing your actions and the way you conduct yourself.<br>
<br>
Or, you could look into the religions of your ancestors, and find one that is more appropriate to your lifestyle. <p><center>
