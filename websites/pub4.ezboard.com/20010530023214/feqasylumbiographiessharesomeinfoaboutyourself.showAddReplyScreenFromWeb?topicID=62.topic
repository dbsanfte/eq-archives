<br>
Reedamus was born in Kaladim, his father was a human monk named Piccolo.  His Mother was a merchant by the name of Lydia Kelly.  When Piccolo first visited the town he fell madly in love with Lydia, and they soon had thier first son, Reedamus.  Not long after his father was called to Qeynos to train and fight.  His mother soon died because she was heartbroken, or so the townspeople say.  Reedamus was two at the time and was soon orphanated.  The leader of the orphanage was a low cleric named Elizabeth Cirelc.  She became a cleric to heal the young orphans.<br>
<br>
Baby Reedamus was taken by a charming dwarf by the name of Dindolin.  Dindolin tried to teach Reedamus to be a warrior like he was, but Dindolin would often have to chase Reedamus around the town.  One Day Reedamus found the cleric guild.  He quickly opened the door and ran forward.  Dindolin ran inside and stopped.  He was too polite to run around a guild like that.  He bowed to the leader of the guild and eyed Reedamus.<br>
<br>
Then there was a cry from within Kaladim.  Dindolin turned and ran out the door to see what happened.  The guild leader point for Reedamus to go after him, so he did.  He ran to the middle of kaladim, to the mine.  A froglok warrior had ran through the guards and was fighting Dindolin.  Reedamus tried to help but he was too weak.  He frustratly watched his father almost die.  Then Reedamus cried out and tried to help.  He found himself using the primitive version of the skill Alteration.  He cast a spell he had learned but ever used before from his the Orphan house.  He healed dindolin and dindolin slew the froglok.<br>
<br>
Not much later the townspeople said more were to come, Dindolin did not wait long, he took Reedamus to the boats and threw him on it, missing it himself.<br>
<br>
Dindolin shouted 'Find Reedare, Reedamus! Find Reedare!'<br>
And that he did.  He searched through Freeport, crying &quot;Reedare! Reedare! Where are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
His soon found Reedare and collapsed in her arms.  She smiled at the young boy and took him to her tent, for the next day she was leaving freeport for Qeynos.<br>
<br>
&quot;As I look back on it now I dont remember much from before the traveling we had from Freeport to Qeynos, my mother and I were planning to become clerics at Qeynos...&quot;<br>
<br>
He left for Qeynos and met up with some friends along the way.  Reedares friend, Speakspells helped slay some enemies for the two to pass, but becuase of his backroung he left at Highhold.  He told them, &quot;Oh well lets just say they dont like me very much Reedare&quot; While smiling.  They went Highhold and met up with friend on the other side, Reedares old old frind Rramsa helped them through the Karanas and said them about through the Qeynos Hills.  They waved Rramsa goodbye as Rramsa went off to the Soutern part of the karanas to slay gnolls and such.<br>
<br>
When they reached Qeynos they emidiately begin to train as clerics.  Reedamus, who was 10 by then, had mastered the low level skills of the cleric and soon killed enemies in Qeynos Hills with a lonely monk by the name of Piccolo.  He did not realize that Piccolo was his father and it was probably better off not knowing who his father was.<br>
<br>
&quot;We were fighting the Gnolls in Qeynos Hills when a mighty gnoll runner, Gnasher Furgutt attacked us.  Piccolo soon became weak, but I kept him from dying, twice.  Unfortunately, *sniff* he was killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was scarred for life, he would never become better, so despite Reedare he left for Ro.  He met Aaspeakk again.  And they fought together for quite some time.  Reedamus was 15 then, and well on his way...to becoming a master cleric'<br>
