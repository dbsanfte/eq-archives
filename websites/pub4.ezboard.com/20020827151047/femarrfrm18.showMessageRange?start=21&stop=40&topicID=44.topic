We also, however, when pushed to the breaking point, are one of the groups of people who stick together and in the end, once angered, demand complete and total vengance.<br>
<br>
If you're sick of people blaming Islam, it's not your place to force them to believe otherwise.  Sure, level headed people realize that Islam isn't the problem, the terrorists are in particular, but you are not dealing with a rational and clear headed populous.  You're dealing with bloodlust.  Walk up to someone who was in the building at the time of the attack and tell them &quot;the facts.&quot;  Walk up to someone who was close to someone who died and tell them &quot;the facts.&quot;  Hell, walk up to any American with a sense of dignity who has not lived in a cave for the past 48 hours and tell them &quot;the facts.&quot;  They won't listen.  They don't want to.  We want justice, we want vengance, and most of all, we want our security back.<br>
<br>
America wept watching innocent victims jump to their death out of a burning and collapsing building... and the images of gleeful, cheering Palestinians following the deaths of thousands - THOUSANDS - of innocent people has burned a hatred in American hearts so deep we will feel it for decades to come.<br>
<br>
Emotions are the key issue here, not what you call &quot;ignorance&quot; because, as we know, when emotions run high, rationality runs low.  You criticize something which cannot be avoided, and which is normal.  We know who are enemies are, but we don't know WHERE they are, so we are afraid.  To the average American, the enemy could be everywhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukhaelwizzie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>khaelwizzie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://keith.vaughan.home.mindspring.com/img/ball3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 684<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/12/01 1:03:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick of ignorant people blaming Islam.</span><hr size=1> Speaking of emotions running high..<br>

Someone mentioned in class today that someone ran in and gunned down two Islamic men at a local 7-11 out on Long Island; they probably didn't have anything to do with the terrorist acts and yet their families are never going to see them alive again.<br>
<br>
Are these American murderers much different from the hijackers on those planes?<br>

This is normal, as far as I'm concerned.  Though I don't entirely agree with it, it will happen.  Think about it...this is the greatest tragedy to happen to the United States since the Civil War, some say...others say it rivals Pearl Harbor.  There is going to be alot of huff-huff for a long time, until the FBI/CIA gets 100% leads on the culprit(s).  Everyone needs to calm down.  This is a time where we all need to stick together and help each other, instead of pointing fingers.  There are children that don't have mom's and pop's anymore.  There are people that will never be able to live a normal day again after this.  We should all really look at what's happened and instead of getting pissed off..we should concentrate on stretching out our hands to help someone that needs it.  These were innocent people...nobody deserved this, but they do deserve support and at least our prayers... <p><center><img src="http://members.home.net/bearface78/SigE3.jpg" height=240 width=320></center>

<br>
I dont think it is right to condem(sp?) Islam as a whole.  I do however believe many of those countries or places housing terrorists are guilty by association, however i dont think that we can just go bombing the innocent people that live there too.<br>

I had many experiences with the Jew the Muslim and the Christian people in the middle east.<br>
<br>
There are many different things about the middle east and America, one notable difference is the way the have a religious apartheid added to the strong beliefs of their God. And the close proximity to each other and in some places cross-over on top of each other.  Palestine and Israel (but there is no Palestine) is the reason that there is fighting going on over there.<br>
<br>
Don't tell me that I have not done my research and had no opinions of these people before this took place.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying wipe every middle eastern country off the map just the countries that pose a threat to my life and the lives of Americans.  Like Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Lebanon, Syria and parts of Sudan and Pakistan.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
 The real issue is with the terrorists and the countries who support terrorism, either overtly or covertly. They include Syria (Islamic Jihad), Iran (Hezbollah), Libya and Iraq (multiple groups).<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
In this point I argee with you about the different radical factions that cause terror in that area.  But the whole area and most of the population infringe on humanities civil rights.  <br>
<br>
You say words like the KKK and the Natzi while the USA is trying to rid the world of people with those methods of racial and cultural cleansing. <br>
<br>
The USA goes over to the middle east to try and help settle disputes and keep the world in a peaceful equilibrium.  If the USA was not there too keep the peace do you understand what type of carnage would take place?  And then the world would pass judgement on the USA saying, why did you not step in and help, dont those people have civil rights?  <br>
<br>
Well we have stepped in and those terrorists have crossed a large ocean to cause carnage on our soil.  Like Bush sayed last night not only are the terrorists responsible for these actions the countries that harbour them are also responsible.  They are conspirators since they know what type of people they have inside their borders and fail to do anything about it.<br>
<br>
My views are clear &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; and just to make sure you wont go after my other eye I will also cut off your hands.<br>
<br>
I participated in a dig in lsrael at Mt. Meron for Rice University.  While in site we were shot at about a half a dozen time by Libyan troops standing on their mountians about 3-4 miles away (a straight shout of about 1 mile).  My best friend had a bullet fragment pierce his wrist, to this day he still has limited movement of his hand.  <br>
<br>
I attended classes in Tantur Israel just out side of Bethlehem, the day after I had left to come back to America a guy that I was in class with was shot and killed by a stray bullet.  I sat right next to him and that could of been me.<br>
<br>
It was my choice to go and visit and learn about the culture in the worlds terrorist hotbed.  If I had died over there it was my choice no one elses.<br>
<br>
America was and has been inserted as peace keepers into the middle east and the terrorist groups of each time period have challenged the US to a pissing contest.  By taking hostiges in Iran or bombing our international embassies.  But the US was never directly pissed on so we treated it as just casulties of war.  Now Ossama decides to come over here and start something.<br>
<br>
That is why a complete genocide must take place in those terrorist countries.  Take them all out and scorch the land in such a way that is unlivable for a 100 years.<br>
<br>
My capitalostic views might not be something that you want to hear but your people have crossed the line and we art fighting for a religion we are fighting for freedom.  And freedom, something that the middle east doesn't understand.<br>
<br>

You think you know what you are talking about, but you do not. <br>
<br>
You can't just visit the middle east for 6 months and claim do have done your research. The only part of the middle east I ever visited was Egypt for 2 weeks, and yet I know more then you do, because I studied the <b>HISTORY</b> of all these peoples. I know why and how this all started. I suggest you do the same before you post another message in this thread.<br>
<br>
I agree with you that the USA has unfairly been put into an "international policeman" roll by the rest of the world, because it is the strongest. But the US has done patheticly little to "keep the piece" as you say, in that part of the world. You are correct that it is in the best interested of the US, and the world to keep that part of the word "stable". But for the US and other western powers, the interests are simple: Control of the oil.  <br>
<br>
I agree that governments that support terrorism should be targeted just as much as the terrorist groups themselves. And once the perpitrators of these attacks are discovered, I would have no problem with the USA and NATO declaring war on any country that harbors them. They are criminals, and what they have done is clearly an act of war.<br>
<br>
But what you are suggesting, is that we attack all nations that have active terrorists groups. Many of the nations you listed consider these groups criminals, and wish to eradicate them too. But you would wipe the entire country out. If we do that, we might as well take out Ireland because of the IRA, or Canada because of the terrorist groups who want Quebec to become independent. While we're at it, we might as well wipe out the USA, because there is more then one terroist group working in this country. <br>
<br>
Your comments are irrational, and wrong. <b>I think its ironic that you claim the US is working hard trying to "rid the world of people with those methods of racial and cultural cleansing," yet you yourself, a US citizen, suggest cultural cleansing by stating "That is why a complete genocide must take place in those terrorist countries. Take them all out and scorch the land in such a way that is unlivable for a 100 years."</b><br>
<br>
I do think the US will never support genocide in any form anywhere. It is just one of the ways the USA is noble and just, unlike those countries that harbor terrorists. I just hope that people like you never gain control of the government here. Its people like you, that put Hitler in contol in the 1930s in Germany. People who are ignorant, and too easily get swept up in the moment. Who don't think, just react.<br>
<br>
Your views arn't capitalistic (another indication that you have no idea what you are talking about), they are racist, bitter, angry, and homocidal just like Bin Laden. <br>

The people who did this are nuts with a highly radical interpretation of Islam.  I consider them to be similar to Southern Baptist fundamentallists armed with bombs, assault rifles, and a grievous lack of respect for human life.  However, they DO have the right to believe this.  It's when they act out against other people when they cross the line.  Again, I say that we should attack the countries that sponsor these people, take them down, and then build them back up, just like we did with the Japanese/Germans in WW2.  Look how well that turned out; the Japanese and Germans are 2 of our allies now.  Make no mistake, those who did this WILL be brought to justice.  But it is no reason to make the largely innocent populations of these countries suffer; all that shall do is make more of them want to kill us.  That is unjust and makes us just as bad as the WTC destroyers.  <br>
<br>
I heard recently that the attack may have been done in response to the cruise-missile attacks launched on Afghanistan during Bill Clinton's term in office.  These attacks, the Taliban claims, killed NOTHING but unarmed civilians.  If so, we must apologize for that (and possibly make recompense), but we must also demand that whoever attacked the WTC be turned over to us.  It's time for the US to review it's response to terrorism, to make sure that we aren't really feeding the fire we are trying to stamp out. <p>Ecofreak Risingwood<BR>

It was a sneak attack, an attack of terrorism, much like Pearl Harbor except for this one was a pure act of cowardliness and jealousy.<br>
<br>
Retaliation and terrorism are two totally different concepts.  My heart aches for resolution.<br>
<br>
Also for those who question the validity of Islamic interpretation of suicide, let it be known that in the Koran and Islamic beliefs, a person who dies in any &quot;holy war&quot; is given absolute and automatic admission into heaven.<br>
<br>
Again let me reiterate that I do not believe mass genocide is the answer.  I do not feel comfortable posting my idea on what needs to happen here, seeing as I am not a politician or expert of any type.  And at some point I think everyone here needs to realize that neither are they.  <br>

<br>
NOBODY is justified in killing someone based on race or religion.  And anyone who says they had the right because they were upset, can just as well justify any killing of innocent victims.<br>
<br>
YES, I have family and friends in NYC, yes I have no confirmation yet that they are all ok.  But that does not mean I would go kill an innocent person.<br>
<br>
As we have heard, revenge is best served &quot;cold&quot;.  Meaning don;t get all hot-headed and start blaming anyone who looks &quot;evil&quot; to you. <p>Vakra Vuvaku

I've been living in the USA for 18 years, since I was 8. I have friends who I still haven't heard from that live in New York, 2 of them work in tower 2. My dad, a very successful business man, regularly flies to New York on business trips that take him to the World Trade Center. Infact, my dad was IN the world trade center, meeting with investors, just one week ago. He could have been the one missing right now. Both my parents just returned from a trip to europe 3 weeks ago, one connecting fight they took was from Washington DC, to San Francisco. A trans contentinental flight, with lots of fuel, just like the hijackers targeted. <br>

<br>
If you had read my previous posts, you would know that this thread i started is aimed at people like Cibola and Straahd2, and others that are calling for mass genocide or say things like, &quot;if your wearing a rag better look out,&quot; or &quot;kill them all, let Alla sort them out.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anger at a time like this is totally normal. And I realize that many of these people, are not thinking rationally. But the recent terrorist attacks are not a license to let their hidden racist ideas and fears spill out.<br>
<br>
Someone said earlier in this thread that a moment of greaving like this is not the time to debate and point out &quot;the facts.&quot; To a large extent I sincerely agree with that. But unfortunately it is during this irrational time, that public opinion is made. And it is becasue of this, that I, more then ever, must speak out and slap the sense back into some people with &quot;the facts.&quot; If people like me do not speak out at times like this, we could see a repeat of WW2 where <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> INNOCENT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Japanese Americans were forced into <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> American concentration camps</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> because no one said &quot;Stop!

If I catch any of my fellow &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; unjustly persecuting someone of middle-eastern decent, I will take action.  Stereotyping and persecution of an entire race because of a few is INTOLERABLE and makes us just as bad as those we profess to hate.<br>
