Why not just make 'em drop trow at the terminal gate?<br>
<br>
Why don't we allow surveillance cameras in the airport and airplane bathroom stalls?<br>
<br>
Because we as a society expect some privacy and respect. <br>
<br>
If a Delta agent cussed you up and down like the Sgt. in Full Metal Jacket, people would sue Delta, and support it.  It's perfectly acceptable to sue a company for using racial, ethnic, or gender slurs, and people would support that because we do not want businesses treating people that way, with no respect or dignity.<br>
<br>
So if someone can sue a business over mere words, why are they evil and greedy for suing over more than just words, but actions that subjected them to embarrasment and ridicule.<br>
<br>
And people argue she's being ridiculed much more now, because her name is all in the news, but suppose she was traveling with friends or family on that plane?  It mentions her husband was there, but do you know who else was on that plane?  <br>
<br>
Also, now that some of the world (the plane and Delta emplyees) knows about her vibrator, is there really greater harm in more of the public knowing about it? Being told in a newspaper that someone had a vibrator is not nearly as embarassing to my mind as having to stand in front of the public holding it up while they all laugh at me in person.<br>
<br>
As a final footnote, and not jumping on you Carathos, this is not wasting any taxpayer money.  This is a civil suit, neither party will be using any tax dollars to try or defend this suit.  The only tax dollars used will be the ones paying the judge and his staff's salary, and the facility expenses of the courthouse it's held in.  And that judge and staff gets a salary regardless of what case they listen to, and for the reasons stated here earlier, I think this case *does* have some merit and at least deserves its day in court.  <br>
<br>
As a final benefit that will actually preserve tax dollars, this lawsuit will help insure that people and the government security forces do NOT go overboard about security and think that is IS ok to strip search people in public.  This private lawsuit will cause government security measures to be reviewed so that someone does not have to sue the government run security over a similar issue, and that *would* cost taxpayer money.  Reasonable security checks, private or government run, can be performed with dignity and respect, and without embarrassing and harassing people.  <br>

<br>
Absolutely.  The error in judgment, however, was not hers.  The error was on the part of the Delta employees who treated her with neither professional nor personal courtesy.<br>
<br>
Did she make an error in judgment?  Probably.  Who when they are coming back from vacation to face work, or children, or whatever her personal stresses were, would be concerned about whether they took the batteries out of the vibrator?<br>
<br>
Forgetting that earned her no money, only mistreatment.<br>

She should get a settlement.. not millions.. but when was the last time any of the men posting in this thread had to deal with ANY kind of sexual harassment??  I am willing to bet pretty close to never.  This was a flight from Nevada to Florida.. that is a rather long flight to have to sit there and deal with that treatment.<br>
<br>
Also.. if they were calling her name over a loudspeaker.. they pretty much knew it wasn't gonna be a bomb.. and when she told them it wasn't.. they had no reason to open it there in public view.  This has nothing to do with 9/11.  that bag DID go thru screening.. they knew there wasn't a bomb in there.. this was dealt with badly by delta.  <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IF </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it had been a bomb, or some kind of terrorist's device, what was the thinking of checking it out NEXT to an airplane? on the tarmac?!?<br>
<br>
Um HELLLOOOO..bombs are, in EQ terms, AoE type devices..not point blank one shot one kill devices, but an Area Effect type of explosion. Did they believe if it was a bomb that it wouldnt hurt the passengers? or the airplane next to theirs? or the terminal the airplane was docked at? And if they didnt believe it was some sort of incindiery(sp?) device, then why all the hoopla?<br>
<br>
very, VERY stupid on delta's part. Imagine if it WAS a bomb..<br>
<br>
ho hum, says a barney fife wannabe, this luggage is making some weird noises, lets open it HERE, on the tarmac, next to this airplane, docked at this terminal, and lets call the owner of the luggage to take it out.<br>

MOST Vibrators do not have an on/off switch... most have a round base that you simply twist to turn it on/off (atleast 95% of vibrators do atleast)... with this being said, having a vibrator in a bag that's being tossed around etc, its going to turn on very easily.<br>
<br>
If she were smart she'd have either put it in a suitcase that wasnt being carried on or taken the batteries out.  I have no sympathy for someone who can be that sensitive when they have no one but themselves to blame for bringing the damn thing on an airplane without KNOWING that they'd be searched.<br>
<br>
Im sure there's no "how to deal with vibrators while searching passengers" section in the guides to being an airline employee.  Honestly I dont see how it can be so certain that an item of the sort could not have bomb capabilities.  <br>
<br>
As far as emotional scarring or whatever I think its crazy to assume those people on that airplane would have thought twice about it, nor would they likely run into her on the street or in the work place later.  I feel she was naive and careless and overreacted to their concern.   <p>Baroness Syldra Marlowe<br>High Priest ~ Affliction<p><font size=1>
It's probably wrong to believe there can be any limit to the horror which the human mind can experience.  On the contrary, it seems that some exponential effect begins to obtain as deeper and deeper darkness falls- as little as one may like to admit it, human experience tends, in a good many ways, to support the idea that when the nightmare grows black enough, horror spawns horror, one coincidental evil begets other, often more deliberate evils, until finally blackness seems to cover everything.
