No, I dint know it was taken. I never asked if naggy was taken in EC since I was never in EC with jaky nor Golems. <br>
<br>
Why did the first attempt fail?<br>
      <br>
       In my first attempt nagafen should have died. I had 33 people, I had a L51 and L42 shaman and L41 enchanter ouchy. But the enchanter indeed landed his tash but our shaman though, feared that if he maloised the beast he would get beaten and die. Therefore he could not slow the beast, naggy than droped all the tanks in a matter of a min or two. I dont want to blame the shaman since I was the one in fault. I should have told him to malois and than try to slow. But despite everything people wanted to do it again. Half the raid I should say. All who stayed told me they wanted to do it again before I ooc that I was going to do it. <br>
<br>
Why did we take too long in buffing?<br>
<br>
     It sad how people jump up and down and say nothing but BS about how it is all my fault. Maybe it was my fault, I had half the zone go LD and maybe it was my fault half of those who went LD could not come back. Maybe it was but one thing for sure is I did rush the raid. <br>
<br>
Why try to rush the raid? <br>
<br>
     I wanted RF(ragefire) for a guildie. When I found out obout the new patch I asked guild if they needed RF. One of my Guildies told me we needed him. So i rushed and tried to invite who ever I could get and try to bring him down and see if we could make him spawn(i know it is inposible since RF is random). When I saw moltaenya's tell I than felt bad since I took naggy but I already had my raid and didnt have the guts to say hey guys lets stop. I didnt want t stop till I killed naggy. I am sorry if it disturbed people, wich is understandable. <br>
<br>
    I asked all clerics to be group leaders and invite those who needed a group. But people do not listen or atleast the majority who was in my raid. <br>
<br>
    I decided not to rush my second attempt. I got the right classes. I had 3 clerics, 3 druids, 2 paladins, 7 warriors, 1 shaman,1 rogue, 2 necros, 2 rangers, 2 bards, 4 monks, and I had a L60 shaman and my self buff the room. I asked people to let dararu agroe the beast and place it near the door than all to attack behind it. But, me dying right away becasue my clerics soulbring culd not heal. I mean, he was healing with a slow healign spell after i told him not too. Not only that, he was told to buff 3 crapy buffs, ressist cold, poison, deseas. He put his 2 cents and buffed R fire with out telling me. People than complained and I told him again. Than he tried to buff again witht he same buffs. I should have told him to leave at that point from the buff line. But I wanted to give him a chance. I should have explaiend to him why I whated him to give those buffs. <br>
<br>
    I dont let my little bro play Golems. My little bro indeed has changed his way and no he is not dumb and doesnt play golems unless I tell him too. I did let him play golems one time that I recall on crombatlleaxe's raid. I had to go to work and he really needed me to buff his raiders so I had no choice. For all who posted nice remarks about me I thank you with the bottom of my heart. By the way emberial, how sad. Why did you say I did not res straif? I was the one who ressed him, I ressed everyone except my monk and haad. I think that was his name. But i ressed him this morning. After all whre ressed people whree screaming lets do it again. I told them I didnt want too do it again. I decided to let moltaenya have a shot at it. Everyone bailed as soon as i said that or atleast the clerics lol. I had my monk straned there. I was going to log my second computer and log Golems to res my monk but for some reason I couldnot do so. <br>
<br>
      PS.. Why did we get wiped out when killing the FG's. I had 2 giants coming and some of the recruits I had brought about 5 spiders and 3 bats while attacking 2 FG's. Everyone pointed at gorndax. I dont know and dont really care. Why him? when we where fighting the 2 firegiatns they saw when he ran to us than died at camp. He might have not seen our monks ooc because he was probably zoning etc. Dont know really who it was, he was the only one that was blamed by the hell tells i recieved lol. But I told them all that who ever trained us did not mean it or something like that. He did a good job though, he kicked some ass or was it knee caps o well. <br>

Ah ha!  I was right!  Once again, we see that Ragefire is the root of all evil.<br>

The raid Golems missed of ours was one in Chardok, of which we were acquiring Falilya's note off the Overking, which is given to Ragefire to spawn Dragon Ragefire.  This was ok, imo.  I believe Falilya has the camp now, I can not log on due to the fact my Butcher Block Mountains files are &quot;corrupted&quot; and I don't know how to fix them.<br>

Actually you don't give the signed scroll from the Overking to Ragefire to pop the dragon.  You give the scroll and the ixiblat fer stick to Omat Vastsea for a orb, causing Natasha whitewater to pop, you give her the note from naxot deepwater to get the shimmering pearl.  You hand Ragefire the pearl.<br>
<br>
I could see it now...<br>
<br>
clueless_cleric_04 tells the guild &quot;spawning Ragefire get ready.&quot;<br>

Zordak Ragefire says &quot;Thank you for a signed scroll clueless_cleric_04&quot;<br>

<br>
So what's the problem with this?  If someone is AFK, sleeping or camped out, that's their decision to do so during a raid.  It happens quite often and people lose out on their rez.  Sending tell after tell to someone and not getting an answer isn't uncommon either, especially if it's to the raid leader.  They get bombarded with tells.  I don't see where Jaky had much room to be pissed at anyone but himself for not staying and making sure his corpse was retrieved.  It is afterall, the players responsiblity if they want to see it again. <p>Tormentcia

<br>
Yeah, we could join uber guilds and argue over who stole Vindicator, or who stole Lodi, or who uses zergling tactics, or . . . . well, I think you get the point.  The game design makes these sorts of squabbles inevitable, and they are present at all levels of the game.<br>
<br>
I think you're correct that pickup raids can do a lot more than just the planes and the old world dragons.  Frankly, I think there are relatively few zones that cannot be raided by a pickup group or a coalition of smaller guilds right now, and the list of zones will shrink as time goes by.  I'd be surprised if any pickup raids ever take on the WW dragons or ToV because of inadequate gear, and VP and ST would be even tougher because of the key requirement.  There are also a few boss mobs that are probably not touchable by pickup raids, such as the Statue of Rallos Zek.  Everything else will eventually be within the reach of a pickup raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrechtbertolt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brecht Bertolt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/27/01 2:03:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: here is how our raid went</span><hr size=1> No golems did indeed kill himself with a mana stone once, i was there to witness it.All 36 people sent him tells laughing at him! hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Brecht Bertolt <BR>

I was, however disappointed about the dueling that went on, and he did try to stop it, short of kicking the people responsable for it out of his raid!<br>
On yet another note, while I have died quite a bit on his raids (sometimes due to my own doing, like trying to retrieve a guildmates corpse and making a wrong turn, I GOT my rez and NEVER lost exp on any raid of his I went on and I always knew what was going on! (for more on this see my thread in Rants and Raves, where THIS thread belongs!)<br>
And YES on the raid today he explained that he was trying to get Ragefire! <br>
Thanks to Golems for having me, and I hope you will allow me to join you again!<br>

<br>
I'm kind of confused. I'm not sure if you are talking about your first raid or your second raid. (I'm guessing from whats posted here that there were two, back to back). Just so you don't think I am trying to attack you...I was just trying to state what a saw from a completely new Naggy raider perspective.<br>
<br>
long buff time- from the 2nd raid...it was a long time. Longer than normal for the amount of ppl we had (24 or 25). Held up at some pt due to confusion with what should be buffed and why certain buffs were cast and not others. And also OOM time. I'm still wondering why Fire Resist was 3rd in line.<br>
<br>
I also distinctly remember in chat that we were told all clerics would be in one grp and all would heal Dararu and no one but Dararu taunt.<br>
<br>
Straif did not get a rez from you. I sent you about 5 tells saying straif had to log, that I needed a port or tl so I could log on straif to get a rez. Voom (who dragged straifs corpse to the zone), Jexielia and Byork as well as a few others who were the last to port can attest to that, and Bunisheol can attest to the fact that I was on as Zendell and rezzed not only her but Straif and Voom. If you had checked Jakys msgs you would have seen several tells from me (as Zendell) telling you I could rez Jaky. If you cast a rez on Straif I have no idea what happened. Straif said he never got a rez window on his screen.<br>
<br>
That is everything as I remember it. No embelishing, no blame. Just fact.<br>
<br>
All I would like to know is why Dararu told Straif he could roll on the CoF? Who's lie was that?<br>

<br>
You whine about groups being done badly, no main assist, etc etc etc<br>
<br>
tell me, what did YOU do to help the situation?<br>
<br>
Ever think about getting off your ass and actually helping organise?  you think perhaps that raid leaders get a special version of the game with a manual for 'Leading Raids 101' ?<br>
<br>
next time you done know the main assist try ASKING and if no-one knows then look for the highest level well equipped tank and ASSIGN HIM YOURSELF if the raid leader is too busy or does not know.<br>
<br>
Got 2 clerics and the tank group has none?<br>
<br>
BOOT ONE OF YOURS AND TELL OTHER GROUP TO GIVE YOU ONE OF THEIR TANKS<br>
<br>
not fucking rocket science is it?<br>
<br>
Lazy ass whiny little bastards like you expect to be lead by the dick to the mob, have their hands held while they kill said mob and then think they deserve some loot whilst simultaneously strutting about how fucking cool they are for killing said mob when all the time if it was not for the raid leaders you'd have difficulty finding the fucking ZONE!<br>
