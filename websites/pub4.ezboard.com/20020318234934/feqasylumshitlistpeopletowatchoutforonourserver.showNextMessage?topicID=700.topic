Tonight was the first memorable time I have seen Warbreed, and hopefully the last if the gods deem it to be.  I am shitlisting him, although quickly, with good merit.  Here is the story, at least from my view and perhaps Warbreed can shed some additional light to this for us all.<br><br>Chancellor in LoIO.  Roughly two hour spawn, has a shaman spear and this is also a piece to the HS key.  He was up tonight when myself and a couple friends logged in.  no one was setting up or in area for him so we began the march to him.  We invis'ed to just outside his room, and setup there to clear the room so we could get him without 20 additional sarnaks.  We started pulling room.  About 5 minutes into our clearing, half the room or so Warbreed runs by us, and straight at the Chancellor.<br><br>Admittedly, we had not engaged the Chancellor so it was his.  He was extremely rude and inconsiderate to barge past us, but this shows his knowledge of the actions to follow and thereby not an accident in my mind.  We were finishing the couple sarnaks we had on us, about 15-20 seconds after he ran by us, he now realized he could not take the chancellor and that he had too many adds.  He decides rather then die there he would run, training the entire room/Chancellor straight into us and run it out back door.  This of course was completely without warning, no shout or anything.  Now as many know, mobs will usually go about 3 per person and extras will fan off and wait.  This means my little group of 3 of us and my pet just gained 12 sarnaks on us.  Odds got ugly quick but we fought on.  We actually cleared them, just in time for Chancellor to come back with a small army of his own.<br><br>At this time we kept things fairly under control, focused on the Chancellor and managed to nearly finish him when the cleric ran out of mana and bash failed to interrupt his gate.  Shortly after the gate we got the 'You gain party experience' message as the DoT killed him just up the hall in his throne room.  However, cleric oom, shaman oom, SK fighting.  All healths below 2 bubbles each.  Cleric runs but failed to make it out before dieing to the horde.  SK feigned and shaman shouted train to BD and FM zone and zoned them out with .5 bubble health.  During all this, the wonderful Warbreed invis'ed and went back in to wait at the corpse.  When it allowed him to loot, he ninja'ed it and then left area.  <br><br>Now this was not all, of course he had to rub it in, with a message to the SK stating 'Thanks for the spear, appreciate you guys working so hard for me'.  So anyone keeping score, he has now trained and ninja looted all in the same fell swoop.  GM's were less then helpful, although they did state this was combination rude player and bad luck.  Train, never happened.  Seems you can't train someone unless you are intentionally trying to kill them.  Simply running for your life into a group is not training.  Ninja looting, nah, GM never saw so didn't happen.<br><br>Sorry all for the long post, just want people to hear the full story, or at least my side of it and hopefully soon a reply from Warbreed.<br><br>So, am I incorrect?  Am I missing some big key?  Has this game gone so far down hill since it's release over 2 years ago?  I hope not, this was uncalled for, and people like this need to be sent a message.  Maybe I am wrong, please let me know if so and I will save myself alot of time and stop playing for good one of these times.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>p.s.  It should be noted that along with the petition which went no where, I have requested his guild to look into this and hope they will deal with it.  I am not sure yet, and as I have not heard back I assume this is getting pushed aside.  I would love to hear from them as well if this is still under research but I am not waiting any longer to post. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughorallblackheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghorall Blackheart</A> at: 5/8/01 12:26:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utarotoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TarotofLanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 1:39:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://eqscreenshot.homestead.com/files/icon66.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1> You need to talk to Frizznik, though I'm not sure if he'll reimburse that item, since it's not a &quot;raid&quot; per se, but rather the timer going off on one mob. Dunno tho they don't really have a clear policy on that, and it's def. worth a shot.<br><br>As to the rest...well if it was just one thing like maybe not realizing you were there for the mob and running past...or just running into you when he had too much shit training I'd say no. The last thing, which was sending a tell to your SK was just the cherry on top of this pile o dung. The whole incident is a rather ugly thing, and IMO belongs here. I can't imagine what explaination anyone could have for such behavior other then &quot;Hey I'm an asshole!&quot;.<br><br>Glad you talked to his guild without feeling the need to mention the guild here, that's nice to see. Hopefully they weren't aware he was such a shithead and will take action. Also though it can sometimes take a couple of days for guild leaders or officers to look into something. The main thing is for them to try to catch the person online, and then after they get their side they still usually need to discuss it with at least the other officers/leaders. So sometimes when it looks like nothing is being done, sometimes it's just them going through their own process. <br><br>Who wants to bet that Warbreed (if he bothers posting) claims it wasn't him on the account but a brother/roomate/friend/burglar who broke in? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umyschiefmaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Myschief Maker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 4:36:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1> This was certainly a frustrating experience for your group.

However, the /tell to your Shadowknight group member was certainly unnecessary.  I hope s/he took a screen shot to give to Warbreed's guild leader.<br><br>I do have one question, though.  You said: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I have requested his guild to look into this and hope they will deal with it.

Did you speak directly to the guild leader?  Was Warbreed still online when you did?  How much time went by between that conversation and your post here?  Did you give them your email address so that they could respond to you if you were offline?<br><br>As Tarot said, it sometimes takes time for a guild leader to investigate and resolve a situation.  If you spoke to an officer, they might be wait for the guild leader before taking any action.  5-7 days might be what it could potentially take if the guild leader is not online or even out of town.  Just some thoughts about why you might not have gotten an immediate response.<br><br>Good luck to you!

I had no time to type train, or run. When I zoned into Frontier mountains Rratiz sent me a tell asking if I was going after the chancellor. I said yes and sorry if anyone got trained I did not have time to type anything. He said No prob, but your and ass. This is when I went back in and killed the chancellor. They had him down to 45% life and he gated to his original spawn spot where a friend of mine Dracol and I took him out. Rratiz got the experiance and we waited for the loot rights. Rratiz was in the hallway feigning death and he had adequate time to come loot the body. I told him thanks for the help I got the prod (the reason I did this is because he called me an ass.). Rratiz then kept threatening me with this shit list crap and woe be to me all the fury of the guilds, etc. etc. Personally I have no problems with anyone, when you call me an ass I take offense. I apologized to him and members of his party such as Dominoe, who I even offered to give her loot because she died! Rratiz you need to get your facts straight, The point is he kept whining and bothering me for many minutes saying that he was going to put me on this list. Personally it is one's word vs. another and I am guilty until proven innocent and I accept that. I even told him the reason I went back in was because he called me an ass. The Gm's even told him he did not have a leg to stand on and he is pissed because i got the loot he could have gotten but he did not.  This is my side of the story and speak to whom ever you wish to find the truth. To be honest as well, yes I am an asshole to those who are blatently rude and immature. There were many members in Rratiz's party I did offer compensation, I even made a zone wide apolgoy for them dying. I know I am here and it is my word vs. his, those who know me know how I am, those who don't, well maybe this will be a stain on my record, but aren't we having fun yet? I say before anyone posts their crying and complaining (especially from a 42 SK Rratiz) get your facts straight, then post.<br><br>Sinceraly,<br>Warbreed McGuiness <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ualundraadjani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlundraAdjani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 12:07:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/catface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Chancellor</span><hr size=1> I know I have a bad memory, but weren't you up here before warbreed?

Anyhow, I will leave the personal slams out from here on.  I would like to state my point on this.<br><br>Yes, we were setup and I was pulling from the chancellor room.  After a few pulls, Warbreed zoomed in past us.  He then engaged the chancellor as if he was a newbie.  If anyone has hunted this guy, they know that he is both tough, and that all the surrounding sarnaks will agro even on a lvl 60 so he was knee deep in a large pile of shit.<br><br>He did, then 'train' us, although I know from a game point this is not pursuable.  He was simply fleeing.  Of course, even newbies learn quickly that a train message or something should be yelled, you would think that by 47th level Warbreed would know this.  /shrug  Alas, I did message Warbreed after he went to zone, but I did not ask him if he was pulling, I asked him if had killed him and did indeed call him an ass for the train and 'pushing' in front of us while we were clearly going for him.<br><br>After chancellor came back, I will assure you he died immediately after gate to DoT death and not at the hands of Warbreed.  I also never saw his friend, only him and believe although I can not recall the exact message he stated to me thanks for killing the chancellor, meaning he knew at the time he did not earn that kill.  <br><br>Oh well, guess someone like this believes his 5 levels are enough that make him superior to me.  Hopefully Dominoe will post to here and we can get all involved to have their say.  As for me, yeah, I think I will go out of my way to cause Warbreed problems.  Maybe someday, he will learn that treating people like NPC's will not get him far and hopefully he will reform or leave gaming for good! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utarotoflanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TarotofLanys</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 12:51:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://eqscreenshot.homestead.com/files/icon66.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1> Sorry Warbreed you were wrong, just based on YOUR side of the story.<br><br>You ran in and engaged the chancellor. You ran past a group outside the room who was obviously clearing it. You obviously saw them, because you sent tells to them after training them.<br><br>The person called you an ass. Let's see...you ran past a room they were actively clearing to engage the one mob that they would have been obviously after. Then when you couldn't handle the mob that you attempted to take from under them, you ran all the mobs into them, training them. I think it's understandable why they would be upset.<br><br>How did you handle this? Were you sincere in being sorry for having not only rushed past them, but training them? Oh you ran back and KSed the mob. At that point they had engaged it and were fighting it and you KSed it.<br><br>You attempt to justify this with &quot;Oh one person called me an ass&quot;.

Im trying to piece together the two stories to find the truth.  But using vegence on someone you trained cause they were complaining that you trained them seems extreme.  Second, Why did you say the only reason you went back there to loot the chancellor was cause they pissed you off, I would think that if you engaged the chancellor you were after something.  Sounds like you saw a clear shot at the chancellor, took it and couldnt do it and brushed the mobs on a group.  Hung out and looked for the drop, and took it.  I have done the chancellor a couple of times, everytime I stop at backdoor groups and ask if they are going in(admitedly selfishly, always trying to recruits tanks to help ; D), and also send a shout to the zone asking if anyone is camping chancelor.  You will find if you had done that you probably would have got some help, iskars need the advisor and are usually more than happy to help.  So the accused here to seems to be in the wrong here, he never claimed he asked about camps, and furthermore admitedly confirmed he saw a group camping chancellor and admitted to training them.  His defense was they didnt properly address him for training them, very poor behavior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 1:09:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: being on board....</span><hr size=1> ack tarot is hacking into my box, she stole my post and reworded and posted before me : ( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucatgut.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Catgut</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 1:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Cleric's Side of this Story</span><hr size=1> For a couple nights, I had been checking in with Ghorall and Rratiz, long time friends of mine on the Lanys server.<br><br>I even parked Dominoe, my 43rd (42nd level again after Warbreed's stunt) Cleric at the FM zone to log on quickly next time we were to go after the Chancellor and the spear.<br><br>I got the call from Ghorall on my alt that the Chanc was up, he was clear (nobody else was camping him), and he had the spear, so I quickly logged my alt and brought on Dominoe.<br><br>While Rratiz held the room before the Chancellor's room and started clearing the main room proper, Ghorall ran out to invis me and lead me in.<br><br>As soon as I arrived, we started clearing the chancellor's room in a big way.  A handful of Sarnaks later, Rratiz asks if we just saw someone go speeding by.  I had seen a blur, but thought it was yet another visual glitch.  I went into the main room to check, and sure enough, there is Warbreed in there trying to solo the chancellor, and getting his ass kicked soundly.  Unfortunately, we had already cleared quite a few sarnaks, or Warbreed would never had been stupid enough to pull this stunt.<br><br>No sooner than we figure out just who it was stealing the Chancellor from us, than he comes ripping out past us with a cozy little train.<br><br>He books it for the FM zone, and I do a /who warbreed all until I see him listed as being in FM.  All the while we continue clearing leftover sarnak stragglers dumped along the way as they file back into the Chancellor's room.<br><br>Rratiz spots the Chancellor coming back, and the big guy gives us the bum's rush, along with with about 2 or 3 sarnaks apiece for each of us.  While Rratiz whales on the Chancellor, and Ghorall dots the hell out of him, I try to keep everybody alive.  I went from full mana to oom fairly quickly in the battle that ensued, and contrary to Warbreed's version of the tale, the Chancellor gated out at about 10%.  I am oom, and the whole party is at 2 bubbles or less of health, so I tell Ghorall and Rratiz that I will try to train as many of them as possible out of the area and hopefully to the zone so they can finish off the Chancellor.<br><br>I don't know what happened to Ghorall and Rratiz for the next minute or so as I stumbled through the halls looking for the way out.  I managed to do a full circle with 3 or 4 sarnaks on me and ended up back at Rratiz and Ghorall, who still were trying to handle about 2-3 sarnaks a piece, and the Chancellor was nowhere in sight.  Suddenly I get an experience message, and the only thing that would give experience to a 43 cleric in there is the Chancellor, so I know he's dead.  Unfortunately, about 3 seconds later, I dropped dead myself while telling Rratiz to fd and Ghor to gate.  I was still oom and had 4 sarnaks kicking my ass, so I was never gonna get the mana to DA or gate.  It was hopeless for me.<br><br>As I re-appeared naked at the FM zone, a kindly barbarian shaman was there and was nice enough to sow me and ask if I needed help.  Being rather annoyed at losing my level, I told this barbarian shaman how annoyed I was with warbreed, and that I had died due to his greed.  This shaman whose name escapes me seemed taken by surprise - and said that he was only here in the zone at all as Warbreed had called him and was doing something for him.<br><br>As I sat down to memorize some spells, Warbreed shows up and something happened that I did not see and this kindly shaman starts thanking Warbreed heartily.  I think I can figure out where the spear went by now.<br><br>Warbreed then says &quot;Gee, I am sorry, did my train kill you?&quot;  (He obviosuly never saw me in the sarnak fortress getting my ass kicked by his train and I can only imagine that he assumed I was some lowbie cleric that died in the many trains that followed.)  In way of recompense he offered me some lame-ass giant's face armor.  This was actually a nice thing to do, had he not just blatantly KILLSTOLEN the chancellor from us, but obviously he (a) had no clue that I was in the party that he had just killstolen the chancellor from and (b) was the cleric that he had been hunting shard wurms with him in a pickup group just the week before in velious.<br><br>So while I applaud him for offering some somewhat worthless trinket to a nameless, faceless, presumably low level cleric he had just gotten killed by his chancellor train, I must condemn him for his every action prior to that point.<br><br>Even after resuscitating myself, I still did not regain level 43.  To boot, he had attempted to killsteal the chancellor and succeeded, had run a massive train over us, and had finally taken the spear from the corpse while Ghorall and Rratiz fought for their lives against his greed-motivated train of death.<br><br>All things considered, I am saddened to hear that Warbreed is indeed a leader of the guild he is in, because it strengthens my resolve not only to outright refuse to resurrect Warbreed with my cleric, or tp Warbreed with my 45th wizard, but this resolve also extends to his entire guild until my temper cools (if it ever does).<br><br>As I have heard before, no good deeds go unpunished, as I found out losing a level while trying to help a friend take out the chancellor, but now I firmly begin to believe that bad deeds usually go rewarded, as Warbreed got to take a hike with both the spear and his life, while i paid the ultimate price.<br><br>Thanks again, Warbreed, for reminding me why I have already quit EQ twice since public release.  Sometimes I meet great, selfless people who I would gladly die for, but a lot of the time I just meet greedy, inconsiderate people who are looking out only for themselves.<br><br>My apologies in advance for my present bitterness towards Warbreed's entire guild, but I can only assume they hold the same values that he does at this point if Ghorall spoke with the other leaders and they had little to say.<br><br>Sorry for the long post, but I have *never* put anybody on the shitlist before.  This so far is the worst thing that has occurred to me in 2 yrs (minus two breaks when I got fed up), and feel I should be as explicit in recounting my version of the events as possible so that people can hear from each of the participants in this little soiree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/3dlgowu2.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 3:00:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/leaf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1> May have missed it but what is his Guild? <p><IMG SRC="http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/sig1.jpg"> <BR><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=18940"><b><i>View Caster's Realm Profile</b></i></a><BR><select name="character"><option value="char1"> Sentinent Soldiers:<option value="char2">Brambler Blackthorn - 51st Wanderer<option value="char3">Gunjack Oakblade - 20th Ranger<option value="char4">Shindo Snakestyle - 21st Monk</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 3:02:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warbreed</span><hr size=1> I also am concerned of what guild has a leader such as this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueqkov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EqKoV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/8/01 3:40:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My final reply....</span><hr size=1> Well to the cleric I know you died, that's why I offered the only item I had you could use. I apoloqized for the train to Rratiz and was met with hostility. Yes I wanted the spear, and that other shaman wanted an orc fang earring btw. Basically the Chancellor gated, we killed him, you got the exp, we did not try to KS since he was below 50% anyway. I tried to talk to Rratiz and all he said is it was his word vs. mine so, so be it. I am sure if you talk to anyone in my guild they know I treat them fairly. I am sorry any of you got grounded or missed doing homework while the chancellor got killed. I tried to apologize, I tried to compensate you, but for all my efforts they were for naught. Those who know me, know me well. Those who don't will make their own decisions.
