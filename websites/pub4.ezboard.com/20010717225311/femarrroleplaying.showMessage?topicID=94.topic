<br>
Masakato sat in a small grove in Surefall Glade, meditating and reflecting on the day's occurrences. Not far off, Natil sat quietly beside her babysitter, the druid Crystal, enthralled by the dance of two colorful butterflies. Zariel had left to take a last swim, but Masakato had stayed to keep watch over her young daughter. The child's laughter and smile brought a warmth to his soul. <br>
Looking at the setting sun, Crystal said, &quot;It is time for Natil's feeding, and then bed. We will see you tomorrow morning, Brother.&quot; Crystal picked Natil up. The young child giggled as the young druid spun her around in the air. “I’ll miss Zariel. I’ll miss you too,” she added. <br>
The taciturn monk smiled slightly and nodded. He opened one eye and grinned as he watched the pair head to the cabin. But soon the smile turned to a frown as Masakato sat there, listening. <br>
<br>
Silence. <br>
<br>
Dead silence. <br>
<br>
The sound of a broken twig sent the monk quickly to his feet, but instantly he was engulfed by shadows. Panic struck then, but Masakato quickly regained his composure. He stood there, fists ready, concentrating. Sensing an unknown presence near, he spun around striking at his would-be attacker. The blow knocked the dark figure back. &quot;Heh.&quot; The dark figure chuckled, &quot;A lucky hit. Come, monk. Let us dance.&quot; The figure leapt at the monk, his dark blade hungry to inflict pain. Masakato landed a few kicks and punches, <br>
But this dark stranger was obviously more experienced and he knew he was facing a losing battle. Suddenly, the stranger's fist cast an eerie glow and Masakato's body was gripped in agony by some dark force. Masakato fell to the ground, his consciousness fading fast. The last thing he saw was a rolled<br>
parchment fall from the dark stranger's hand. <br>
*** *** *** <br>
<br>
Zariel walked through Surefall Glade. She had just taken what she knew would be the last swim in the pure waters of Surefall Glade for a long time. She had taken longer than usual, trying to preserve the memory in her mind, against her coming trials. A gentle breeze blew fallen leaves into her wet hair. As she stopped to pull them out, a chill raced up her spine. The wind suddenly became colder. Zariel looked about waiting for an unknown enemy to leap from the dark shadows. Nothing. Quickly Zariel dismissed the thought, surely it was just the change of seasons. Or the wind on her body, which still glistened with water from her swim.<br>
Zariel made her way home, the last few moments a fleeting thought. She opened the door to find the room surprisingly dark. Lighting a lantern, Zariel gasped in horror. Crystal, one of the rangers left to watch <br>
Natil, sat at the dining table - dead. Her neck was sliced open, the gash resembling a cruel smile. Her mouth was locked in a mute scream and her eyes stared at the last vision of horror she had seen. The note Zariel had left to send to the Council was gone, as was her hawk, Onyx. <br>
Panic stuck Zariel like a bolt of thunder. <br>
<br>
Natil. <br>
<br>
Running into her bedroom, she stopped dead at the doorway. Natil laid there, giggling. Holding onto her was a knight dressed in the purest black of armor. <br>
<br>
&quot;Drazhkahn.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Ah! The monk returns,&quot; Drazhkahn grinned. &quot;Go ahead young one.&quot; he said looking down at Natil. &quot;Say it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Vin-doo-ee&quot; Natil said. Drazhkahn smiled in delight at the look of horror that crossed Zariel's face.<br>
&quot;She is a quick learner, this one is. She must have gotten it from her father's side.&quot; Drazhkahn grinned, daring Zariel to lunge at him. Zariel took one step towards Drazhkahn, her fists curled tight, the knuckles turning white. &quot;Go ahead young monk, and it will be the last word your daughter says,&quot; Drazhkahn said as he held the child in front of him and tickled her. Natil's giggling made Zariel's heart race. <br>
&quot;What is it that you want?&quot; Zariel asked.<br>
&quot;What a lovely daughter you have here,&quot; Drazhkahn replied, ignoring Zariel’s question. &quot;But why you neglect her by leaving her with such careless fools is beyond me.&quot;<br>
&quot;If you harm her I will --&quot; Zariel said through clenched teeth.<br>
&quot;I think you are not in the position to be giving threats. But what a conundrum this is, whatever shall you do?&quot;<br>
&quot;Give her to me,&quot; said Zariel slowly, reaching out. Her voice was calm, but Drazhkahn could see the flash of panic in her eyes. &quot;Give her back.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; replied the Shadow Knight silkily. &quot;Hold still, monk, or I will kill her.&quot; Zariel froze. Drazhkahn smiled. &quot;That's a good girl.&quot;<br>
&quot;What is it that you want?&quot; Zariel repeated. Drazhkahn shook his head.<br>
&quot;Dense you are,&quot; he said, &quot;like all other humans. It should be obvious what I want.&quot;<br>
&quot;Mama?&quot; said the little girl suddenly. &quot;Mama!&quot; she reached out to Zariel, who remained still, a look of intense pain on her face. Natil began to fuss. Drazhkahn tickled her again, and she calmed down.<br>
&quot;Now, Zarry,&quot; began Drazhkahn.<br>
Predictably, Zariel flared. &quot;Don't call me that! That name is not for you to use!&quot;<br>
&quot;I believe I said you were in no position to make threats?&quot; Drazhkahn said. &quot;Yes, and no position to make demands either. I will call you what I like.&quot; Zariel glared, but remained silent. &quot;Now...Zarry...as to what I want, I think I will not tell you yet. But there is something others want. Tell me, does the name Reionik sound familiar?&quot; The young woman's response to that surprised even the usually imperturbable Drazhkahn. He watched in interest as Zariel suddenly doubled over, as if in a spasm of pain. A muffled moan escaped her. &quot;I see it does,&quot; said Drazhkahn. &quot;And of course, there are Natil's father's interests.&quot;<br>
At that, Zariel straightened up, glaring at Drazhkahn in defiance. &quot;She has no father.&quot;<br>
&quot;That is not what I hear,&quot; Drazhkahn mocked the helpless monk. &quot;There are some that are interested in your child. I am interested in the mother. I will take your child to them. If you want to see her again, I recommend you come too -- quietly.&quot; Zariel glared at the Shadow Knight, but nodded her head in agreement. &quot;Here,&quot; Drazhkahn said, tossing Zariel a bottle of clear, red liquid. &quot;Drink its contents in their entirety.&quot;<br>
Zariel looked at the bottle, then at Drazhkahn. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously.<br>
Drazhkahn laughed, &quot;It is not poison, I assure you; it is merely to make sure our journey is a safe one. Now drink or I will leave you here with an empty cradle.&quot;<br>
Zariel frowned at the Tier'dal's words. She looked down at the bottle and drank down its contents. It tasted sweet, like honey, but then a burning sensation overcame her as the liquid raced down her throat. Her stomach felt warm as she gasped for air, trying to quench the fire that seemed to be ablaze in her mouth.<br>
&quot;What was this?&quot; Zariel asked. The room seemed to shift and move.<br>
&quot;It is nothing but Neriak's finest, my sweet.&quot; Drazhkahn said, as his image became blurred and distorted. &quot;Now this may hurt a bit...&quot;<br>
&quot;Mama. NO!&quot; Natil cried out, but Zariel's reactions were dulled and the last thing she felt was the hilt of the Shadow Knight's reaver against her head.<br>
Darkness welcomed her like an old friend.<br>

<br>
&quot;Masakato! Masakato, my friend. Are you alright?&quot; The voice was that of Ran, one of the Rangers who watched over Surefall Glade. &quot;Huh?&quot; Masakato asked as the man helped him to sit upright.<br>
&quot;I was on my way back from Qeynos,&quot; Ran replied, &quot;and I noticed signs of a struggle. I fear I have bad news, my friend. Crystal is dead, and Zariel and her daughter are...missing. I could find no tracks; all I have found is you and this letter.&quot; Ran's face was creased with pain as he spoke of Crystal; Masakato could tell it took all Ran's strength to keep from weeping.<br>
Masakato himself was filled with grief when he heard the news. He was supposed to have watched Natil, to have protected her. His hands shaking lightly, he took the parchment and unrolled it.<br>
It read: <br>
I have the child of Innoruuk and her mother. You need not look for them. They are now lost to you, but your Sister will fulfill my needs immensely. Do not be so foolish as to assault Neriak. By the time you reach the Third Gate, the child will be gone and her mother will be swinging from the hooks of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
The missive looked to have been written in blood.<br>
Masakato looked up from the letter, his sorrow turning to grim determination. &quot;Arikel. I must get this letter to Arikel.&quot;<br>

<br>
The darkness was slowly swallowed by a brilliant, white light. Zariel's eyes slowly adjusted to the change, but she rubbed them as she looked about the scene before her. She stood in the middle of what appeared to be the final moments of a large battle but everything was devoid of color. Shades of grey and white stood in contrast to the dense blacks, as a large group of white armored knights surrounded a lone knight in black. The white knights were all faceless, their features wiped away leaving a pale, blank appearance, but the black knight - he had a visage. Zariel's hands curled into fists as she looked at the dark knight. It was Drazhkahn. The large group of warriors surrounded him as he knelt over the corpse of a female Tier'dal. Black tears stained his grey skin as he held the dead female in his arms. Zariel refused to believe that he could feel such sorrow. Zariel stood close by, ignored by all as the scene played out before her, the faceless knights surrounding Drazhkahn, their weapons drawn and ready. Drazhkahn's pain turned to blind rage as he leapt at his enemies. His fury fell three of them but the battle was short lived as the rest quickly overpowered him. He winced in pain as a spear pierced his back; the point glistened with his glossy, black blood as it ripped through his chestplate. Blade strokes bit into his armor and flesh and soon, the dark knight fell to the ground.<br>
Zariel watched as Drazhkahn crawled to the female Teir'dal, his life quickly feeding the hungry soil. He reached out to her, his hand only inches away from her final resting-place….<br>
Time and space seemed to slow as a large axe blade swept down to end the Shadow Knight. Drazhkahn desperately reached out, oblivious to his inevitable demise. As the blade struck the knight, the sorrow and pain of a thousand lost loves wailed in Zariel's mind as a brilliant flash of white light blinded her again.<br>

<br>
Zariel woke and leapt from a large ornate bed. She glanced around, looking for her daughter, but the sudden quickness sent a rush of blood to her clouded mind. She stumbled as her hangover worsened and the room spun briefly out of control. She held the sides of her head as she looked around.<br>
&quot;This certainly isn't Surefall.&quot; Zariel muttered.<br>
A fireplace roared on one side of the room, the mantle resembling the maw of some foul demon. Tapestries and ornate shields adorned the walls, depicting hideous scenes of bloodshed and death. A large yeowood chest stuck out, an odd contrast to the bronze and obsidian. Curious, Zariel went over to the chest. Locked. She wondered what a chest, so obviously out of place, was doing in such a dark-hearted room.<br>
Suddenly the large, bronze double doors swung open. Zariel stood and spun around, one leg lashing out in a round kick automatically. Drazhkahn, however, seemed to have expected this, and she missed him entirely.<br>
&quot;Ahhh. I see that you are awake,&quot; Drazhkahn said with a sly grin. &quot;I take it you are comfortable with your new attire?&quot;<br>
In her perplexed state, Zariel had not realized that she was no longer wearing her armor; she was dressed in shimmering gossamer cloth. It felt smooth to the touch and seemed to radiate a light, white glow. It must have been crafted by the hands of a master tailor, for the seams and stitching were completely hidden.<br>
&quot;Where is my armor?&quot; she demanded, gazing at the dress in disdain. &quot;Give me back my gi! Monks don't wear dresses -- I certainly don't wear dresses!&quot; Suddenly, the expression on her face changed from disdain, to revulsion, to outright horror. &quot;How,&quot; she said hoarsely, &quot;did I get out of my armor and into this dress?&quot; Zariel looked around her wildly, afraid to see what might rest in Drazhkahn's eyes, a dull flush spreading from her neck to her cheeks, where it flamed red for a moment before she forced it down. Suddenly, her azure eyes flew wide. &quot;Natil!&quot; she cried. &quot;Where is my daughter? Give her to me!&quot;<br>
&quot;Not even a thanks.&quot; Drazhkahn frowned, &quot;After all the trouble I went through.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thanks?&quot; Zariel exclaimed, her face growing hot again. &quot;For what? You are the one that has taken my daughter from me! Now where is she?&quot;<br>
&quot;As you wish.&quot; Drazhkahn said as a young Fier'dal chambermaid entered, holding Natil's hands, helping the little girl to walk.<br>
&quot;Mommy!&quot; Natil exclaimed, her eyes sparkling in delight. She was dressed in a small green silk robe and lotus blossoms adorned her head like a crown.<br>
Zariel ran to Natil and clutched her in her arms. Neither Drazhkahn nor the chambermaid stopped her. She held her daughter close. &quot;What is it you want from us?&quot; Zariel asked, looking up at Drazhkahn, &quot;Where are we?&quot;<br>
&quot;That I can answer monk,&quot; Drazhkahn replied. &quot;You are deep within the city of Neriak, where only a few have the privilege to gain access to. There are no guards within these walls for there is no need; to enter and leave you need to be imbued with a certain mark, a mark that neither you nor Natil possess. But I doubt you will want to travel the streets of Neriak anyway; the guards will not take your presence lightly, especially if you carry a Tier'dal child with you. But feel free to wander about the halls and rooms of the guildhouse. If you require anything, tell one of the slaves and they shall oblige you, but unfortunately, they have a small vocabulary so conversation will not be easy.&quot; He grinned evilly as he glanced at the Fier'dal slave. The slave looked down at the floor as she opened her mouth.<br>
Half of her tongue had been cut off. Drazhkahn seemed amused at the look of sympathy Zariel gave the slave girl.<br>
&quot;Yes, to avoid capture, most of them preferred to swallow their own tongues.&quot; Drazhkahn continued, &quot;Now, it is seen to that they are not given that luxury. Drazhkahn looked down towards Zariel. &quot;I will have no qualms of doing the same to you if you do not cooperate.&quot; Zariel hugged Natil even closer; she wasn't going to let Natil from her sight anymore, and this monster wasn't going to take her away again!<br>
&quot;Now I have a small matter I must attend to. If you travel into the kitchen, please be careful of the ogres. They have a fondness for human flesh and it would be a shame for you to lose an arm because you got too close. I shall return upon the new moon. Then we can discuss what is to come.&quot;<br>
With that Drazhkahn left the bedroom, closing the double doors behind him.<br>
<br>
He left mother and daughter deep within the dark city of Neriak.<br>
<br>
Alone.<br>

<br>
Drazhkahn stormed into the banquet hall, his eyes burning with hatred and his skin red-hot. &quot;There you are!&quot; Drazhkahn yelled as he pointed to a young necromantic apprentice. &quot;How dare you!&quot; The young necromancer looked about for help as the others sat there, watching the drama unfold.<br>
&quot;There are many that believe she is tainted,” the necromancer replied. &quot;She must be destr..ugh.&quot;<br>
The necromancer's words were cut short as Drazhkahn lifted him out of his chair and sent him flying headfirst into the fireplace mantle. His head made a sickening crack upon the stone, and a crimson streak painted the stone as he slumped down to the marble floor. He then lay there near the fire, groaning in agony.<br>
Drazhkahn knelt beside him, a look of concern over his face. He moved his hand gently over the necromancer's jawline, wiping away the blood that trickled down from the wound near his temple. Suddenly, Drazhkahn’s face turned dark, a snarl etched across his lips. His grip tightened around the young man's neck as he pushed his head into the roaring fire.<br>
A sudden cry echoed across the chamber. &quot;Stop! Stop it!&quot; Zariel screamed, horror plain in her voice. &quot;Stop, please!&quot; She rose to her feet, but did not -- dared not -- move. Drazhkahn did not seem to hear her; he certainly did not acknowledge her. The young monk's pleas did no good. Sitting again, she pulled her knees up to her chest, burying her face against them as she began to sob.<br>
Screams of terror and pain erupted from the blaze as the young necromancer's hair and flesh caught fire. Zariel clapped her hands to her ears, trying to block out the sound. The necromancer flailed his arms wildly, searching for a means to escape Drazhkahn's wrath, but the grip of the Shadow Knight held. Within minutes, the pleas and cries for help were extinguished.<br>
Drazhkahn held up the remains of the necromancer; his eyes had melted, his hair was gone, the flesh charred and peeling. The smell of burnt flesh filled the room. Zariel was still shaking with tears, her hands still over her ears, as though she could somehow block out what had happened.<br>
&quot;Let this be a warning.&quot; Drazhkahn told all in the banquet hall. &quot;No one -- no one -- harms MY child!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udrazhkahn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drazhkahn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/10/00 4:03:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Taken (continued...)</span><hr size=1> Part 7: Father<br>

&quot;Let us get one thing, straight, Dark Elf,&quot; hissed Zariel. Drazhkahn watched her with amusement. She was striding back and forth across the room accorded her at the guildhouse of the Children of Darkness. She was obviously very angry. Both fists were clenched tightly, and he could tell by her walk that she was battle ready. Her every muscle was clenched, from her jaw to her feet in their slippers of soft leather. No sense letting her have boots; after all, she wouldn't be going outside. The green dress she wore swirled around her legs, occasionally clinging to thigh or hip in a way that was almost provocative. She had not asked for her armor back since the first day, but Drazhkahn could tell she was still as unhappy in dresses as ever. It was this, along with her determination not to hit him, that he found so humorous.<br>
Suddenly, Zariel rushed at him, stopping just short of touching him. She was tall, even for a human, and had a good six inches on her captor, which now she used to her full advantage. He was not scared a bit. <br>
&quot;She is not your daughter!&quot; the monk yelled. Drazhkahn, not moving, arched one silver-white eyebrow. &quot;Natil is _my_ daughter! Mine and no one else's, and most certainly not yours!&quot;<br>
Breathing deeply, Zariel stepped back. She longed to spit at him, that supercilious piece of filth. Calling Natil his daughter, and in front of his whole bloody (literally, in some cases) guild, no less! How could he? How dared he! Zariel was shaking with suppressed rage. More than spitting at him, she wanted to hit him. She had given that monster, Reionik, a black eye, and it had been one of the more satisfying moments of her life. The price the necromancer had extracted had been worth it. Yet she dared not hit Drazhkahn; in fact, she really hardly dared to talk back to him. She could not do anything that would endanger innocents.<br>
Zariel was no fool, and she knew he would not dare to harm Natil. Drazhkahn believed that Natil was the daughter of his god, Innoruuk. Completely impossible, of course, but he insisted upon it. That particular delusion was fine with Zariel, as it kept Natil perfectly safe. Furthermore, Zariel felt fairly sure Drazhkahn would not hurt her, and if he did, she knew she could stand it. He would not kill her, nor maim her, so Natil would not be left an orphan, and Zariel would not be incapable of caring for her once they escaped. However, she knew there were other innocents in this house of horrors. She did not doubt for a minute that Drazhkahn would take his anger out on a Fier'Dal servant, and favor Zariel with all the details later. Or worse, he would force her to watch, to hear the inarticulate screams that were no doubt pleas for mercy. And she would be unable to stop him, or to spare the poor victim any pain. Therefore, she restrained herself.<br>
Drazhkahn's eyes seemed to dance, daring her to act. &quot;Say you so?&quot; he asked, his voice smooth, almost a purr, almost seductive. Zariel looked away. &quot;I do not think I like your attitude, monk,&quot; Drazhkahn went on, sneering. &quot;We have had this discussion before, have we not? About who is in a position to make demands, and who is not?&quot; She said nothing. &quot;Answer me,&quot; he snarled, his voice like a whip crack.<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, grinding her teeth.<br>
&quot;And who did we decide was in a position to make demands?&quot; he asked, his voice silky once more.<br>
&quot;You,&quot; she spat, hating every moment of this. She thought of the pain and torture she might be sparing another person. That was why she was doing this, and it was enough reason. Who knew what depraved things he did as part of his everyday routine, things her mind could not even dream of? She could not look at him; no matter why she was doing this, shame burned inside her. But, bright stars in the firmament, he had burned a man to death in the middle of dinner last night!<br>
Drazhkahn was enjoying this. He was not certain why Zariel had suddenly become so tractable, but he could guess. He could also tell that this behavior did not make her happy; in fact, it shamed her and made her miserable. Drazhkahn was pleased. One way or another, she would learn to obey him, to accept what was to come. What he knew had to come. Innoruuk had not made a mistake in choosing this woman for the mother of His child; he had made a mistake in allowing Reionik to be His instrument. <br>
Zariel's brother Arikel, who Drazhkahn hated more than any other person, had saved her too quickly. There had not been time to corrupt her. But now Drazhkahn had her, and there was no way her brother, or any of her guild, could get to her.<br>
&quot;Now, let us get one _more_ thing straight, Human,&quot; he said, mocking her earlier words.<br>
She turned to look at him, her eyes narrowed. &quot;I...have...a...name,&quot; she growled from between gritted teeth.<br>
&quot;Yes, I know...Zarry,&quot; he said, his voice almost a caress.<br>
&quot;Zariel!&quot; she cried. &quot;My name is Zariel, to you!&quot;<br>
&quot;I will call you what I please,&quot; he informed her shortly. &quot;It does not please me to call you Zariel. It is such a hard name, for one so tender.&quot; She glared at him, but said no more. &quot;Now, repeat after me: Drazhkahn is Natil's father.&quot;<br>
&quot;I will not! You are not!&quot; cried Zariel, horror and revulsion on her face. Drazhkahn sighed. He had not really expected her to acquiesce. &quot;She has no father! Only me! There was no father! And even if there was, it would never in a million years be you!&quot;<br>
&quot;There was then, and there is now, monk!&quot; Drazhkahn shouted back. &quot;And there always will be, and he is I!&quot; Drazhkahn turned his back on her and stormed out. It did not matter if he had not sired the child, couldn't she see? Was she as blind and foolish as all her kind? Natil certainly looked more like him than she did like Zariel! Natil was his child, his daughter. Outside the chamber, he cornered the Fier'Dal chambermaid who was bringing in a freshly bathed Natil to see her mother.<br>
&quot;Not today,&quot; said Drazhkahn shortly in Tier'Dal. &quot;Today I will spend with my daughter. Her Tier'Dal is not as proficient as it should be, since her mother makes her speak Common. Vendui, beauty,&quot; he added, turning to the little girl, using her mother's favorite pet name for her, &quot;How are you today?&quot;<br>
Looking up at him with eyes like pools, as deep, as blue, and as innocent as her mother's, Natil replied, &quot;Ven-dwee, Dwaz-kan!&quot;<br>
&quot;Today,&quot; Drazhkahn said, casually shoving the chambermaid out of his way, &quot;we're going to learn a new word. That word is, 'Father.' Can you say, 'Father,' Natil?&quot;<br>

<br>
Inquisitor N`var followed the thin Feir’Dal slave girl through the elaborate hand tooled oak doors to the study of the recently reclusive Ezra Darkreign.  He couldn’t help but feel as if he had just stepped into the nest of a black widow.  <br>
<br>
Ezra stood, back to the door, looking at a large painting which hung over a massive desk.  The painting was of the legendary Teir’Dal Shadow Knight, Z’Tor the Cruel.  The scene was the moment after Z’Tor had bathed in the blood of his life long nemesis, Terrin Silvermoon, Koada’Dal priest of Tunare, when Z’Tor shoved his own blade into himself, ending his life.  <br>
<br>
“What does this story teach us?”  Ezra asked with out turning around to face N`var.  <br>
<br>
“Relevant, this is not.  Think, I do, that we…” N`var began<br>
<br>
“Answer the question!” Ezra demanded, spinning around to face the inquisitor.  <br>
<br>
“Priestess Ezra, I …” N`var began again in protest.<br>
<br>
“Exactly!” Ezra interrupted him again.  “Am I not a priest of our Lord Innoruuk?  Is not part of my sacred and sworn duty to teach and spread the way of our father, the way of Hate?  Now what does this story teach us?”  <br>
<br>
Inquisitor N`var sighed heavily knowing he would not make much progress until he appeased the strong willed cleric.  He stood and looked at the painting trying to recall all of the details of the story depicted by it.  Finally he spoke.  “Teaches us that to become so obsessed with our goals, we should not.  Teaches us, that we…”<br>
<br>
“Wrong.”  Ezra stated bluntly as if he had given her the incorrect answer to a simple mathematics problem.<br>
<br>
“Fine.  Move on we should.  Here to discuss…” He began again.<br>
<br>
“You have to know your purpose.”  Ezra said ignoring the inquisitor’s changing of the subject.  “The spreading of Hate is what a Teir’Dal lives for.  T’Zor could have killed Silvermoon at any time, yet he did not.  His exploits are well documented in his tormenting of the priest of Tunare, and our people revere those exploits.  When T’Zor finally succeeded and taught the priest how to truly hate him, he killed the priest.  Having fulfilled his purpose, he had no more reason to go on living.”<br>
<br>
“Silly, that is.” N`var replied tiring of Ezra’s speech and refusal to use the traditional dialect of the Teir’Dal.  “Find a new purpose, he could…”<br>
<br>
“And risk growing soft?”  Ezra retorted, her emotions beginning to flair.  “What if he never found another true purpose?  He would have lived his life, day by day not knowing what he existed for.  He completed his life when he taught the priest to hate him.  Anything else was a waste.  Is your life so important that you risk your purpose just to live it?”<br>
<br>
Inquisitor N`var silently glared at Ezra.  “Then getting to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> purpose, I will.”  Ezra laughed out loud but N`var, tiring of the game of cat and mouse she was famous for playing, ignored her and pressed on.  “Demand to know what is going on in your so called guild hall, I do.”<br>
<br>
Ezra raised an eyebrow at N`var.  “What ever do you mean?” <br>
<br>
“Harboring a Knight of the Holy Story within the walls of this great city, are you not?”  He demanded putting the full weight of the authority granted him by the upper class of Neriak into his voice.<br>
<br>
“Does that scare you?” Ezra replied nonchalantly, looking at her fingernails. <br>
<br>
“Nay, it does not.  However, encourage the wrath of the Knights, you should not.  Think this is wise, the noble houses do not.”  He stated as a matter of fact with all the aloofness he could muster.  <br>
<br>
Ezra’s eyes went red with anger.  “Does Cazic-Thule walk in the ranks of the Holy Storm that you should fear them so?”  Ezra said, her voice seethed with anger.  <br>
<br>
“Afraid, we are not.”  He protested.  <br>
<br>
“You quake with fear at the presence of a single monk.”  Ezra spat.<br>
<br>
“Safe, it is not.    We…” He began.<br>
<br>
“SAFE!” Ezra roared in exasperation.  “Sense when has the mighty Teir’Dal been reduced to hiding for their survival rather than fulfilling the will of our God?  When Drazhkahn raises his daughter to be a mistress of Hate and death, we win.  When the monk bitch watches him teach Natil in the ways of our Lord and rages in her heart with hatred against him and curses his name, we win.  When the Knights howl in pain and vow retaliation for the “wrongs” we have committed and lash out at us in fear, in rage and all in the name of justice and valor, but in name only for it will be hate that motivates them… then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> we win</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Survival is not an option!”<br>
<br>
“Misunderstand you do…” N`var began again.<br>
<br>
“Blind is what you are.  Blind and ignorant.  Fools all who think simple survival is what we were born for.  We are born of hate, breed in hate and die in hate.  You cower and hide in the safety of your stone walled homes and all the while you lose that which made you live… Hate.  You disgust me.  Be gone from my sight or I will teach you first hand the Hate of our God.”  Ezra fumed as she reached out and scratched her nails across his face drawing four lines of blood from his cheek.  “Wear my mark in fear coward, fore if you enter this house again, you will die!”  <br>
<br>
Inquisitor N`var was taken back for a moment then hastily ran from the study.  He ran strait into the massive bulk of the ogre shaman, Dkunblu, who had just happened to pass by.  Not knowing exactly what was going on, Dkunblu made a quick judgement call and roared a thunderous battle cry at the inquisitor, sending him scampering out of the guild house like a terrified jack-rabbit.  <br>
<br>
A few moments later, Ezra stood beside Dkunblu.  “Nice timing, luv.” She said smiling at the image burned into her mind of the “powerful” inquisitor fleeing like a halfling from a dragon.<br>
<br>
“Mez gud at dat.”  Dkunblu said smiling<br>
