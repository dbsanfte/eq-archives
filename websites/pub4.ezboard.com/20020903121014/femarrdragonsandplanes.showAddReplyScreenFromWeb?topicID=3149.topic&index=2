<br>
You want to push some morons buttons to get a reaction that involves the pulling of a knife you do it away from a place where mothers with children and the elderly gather.<br>

That other guy tried to get me on the ground, they couldn't do nothing to me in front of witnesses. I was happy to sock the guy once and leave it at that. It wasn't just about $20. He kept coming, I kept him at armslength. He tried to live up to his tough as @#%$ self image but fell short in the litmus test, I punched him. I hunched he was going to go for broke just to even out in front: he'd even kill somebody just to win an arguement over $20, that's how it goes, and I was right. Police are looking for a killer and his accomplice, robbing a 711 or something, their descriptions fit these two. Maybe I did more than just uncover his gutless heart, maybe I did people a favor and put the scent on a killer Victorian police are looking for even now. They sure as hell want him. They seemed happy with my story, most times I could be looking at a caution and possible charges myself. <br>
<br>
As I said, I had been inside Centrelink and I already knew who was around. I didn't shock anybody in there with a knife. It was the other guy's actions which frightened anyone, and that's his own call not mine. I chose not to get stabbed, and maybe killed, in front of everybody, which is a lot smarter and less traumatic for others, trust me. <br>
<br>
Most people here have seen the news: a lot of ppl are being knifed and killed in arguements with these guys at train stations and shops in similar situations. The guy is a crook, I know him, and he is using drugs and stealing anything he can to feed his habits. I know this. I know of him. I put the mark upon him and witnesses are going along with my call. As a neighbor he took advantage of my trust and to a lesser extent he took advantage of my family when a boy. <br>
<br>
The whole damn neighborhood has been terrorised by the lot of them, and their violence around here. Including me. This boy grown into adulthood just never grew up.<br>
<br>
I have gone without sleep many times because junkies would knock at my window asking for food, money, use of my phone and cigarrettes. One comes inside claiming it has been bashed and in fear of death, another is let in by her and another and another all without even asking me. Vice versa their boyfriends called on my window to be let in. This just went on and on. I ended up broke and hungry over many months because 'NO' has no meaning to their women and 'get out' is a mortal insult. <br>
I have been ripped off things I had to scrimp for to afford. It ran up my bills, left me hungry, and broke and tired and angry. I couldn't leave my dwelling until they were all out, I had my own life and it was being destroyed by dirt that abused my good faith. <br>
<br>
My life has been threatened at knifepoint a number of times. <br>
<br>
I have had fights with them before ( New Years Eve, 2 on 1 again). One night I did let in a drunk who had been evicted and he needed a bed, guess what, he pulled a knife on me. He was an abusive bastard who happened to be mean when drunk. He called around drunk again 3am at night running his knife up and down on my security door. I refused to answer, I had a intervention order on them all and had avoided them like plague for months. He smashed my front window, he smashed windows up and down the street, and he died of his cuts: he bled to death in the main street outside his own cousins window. They didn't let him in. His blood was smeared all over their window. <br>
I wasn't going to stand 'grandiose' bullshit from a punk who knew me better. None of their promises to repay me ever came good, I became a standing joke. My phone bill went up $895 for one month's service. I paid it. They laughed. They ate more of my food than I did: I went hungry. They used my shower and the laundry machine to a degree I didn't have my home to myself anymore, and that was downright invasive. My neighbors complained. They were getting called too. It seemed my fault that the junkies came around. Newsflash, they victimised the flats before I moved here too. They didn't give a @#%$. <br>
Same attitude applied to my $20 he didn't give a @#%$, and that's what I cared about more. I never seriously expected him to pay. I wanted my self respect back and I have it. <p><p><br><br><h1 align="LEFT"><font size=1>signed Mistyglen</h1></font></p><p><br><h1 align="CENTER"><font size=1>A GREEN Dragon lies beneath!</font></h1>

Maybe you will get stabbed. Maybe you will just have some ribs broken. Maybe just maybe you will wake up in a bodybag. <br>
<br>
Dude for 20 bucks it is just not worth it.<br>
<br>
Shame and anger make people do some crazy things. I know one thing from my 32 years on this earth. You have shamed the other guys, and it won't end there.<br>

And no I am not threating him. I don't even know the guy. But crap like this is what gets a small bad situation, into a big bad situation.<br>

I worried about the same thing.<br>
<br>
Certainly I've put myself at risk of a payback but having dealt with it before, pretty much lived with it before, peace is something I value as the prize. $20 is just conversational. <br>
<br>
I can look forward to more, I am no mountain of courage but I do keep the screws on. If I am not pushy when the abuse starts all that amounts to is some shoving me around and maybe another fight. Fighting back is okay around here if you win. <br>
<br>
Nobody hiding their identity wants to draw attention to the present whereabouts and a positive identitification, alas for my sinking heart (and haha been there too) I have entered the serpents nest, and I walked out again, this time. I can stand a bloody lip, black eye, broken ribs and usual melee stuff: Shukokai, ya know... Anything more just won't work to the other sides advantage, and you can bet on it, the people concerned frequently have much to hide.<br>
<br>
It wasn't smart to bring it up, I did though and I backed my next play because no-one else was clapping me over the record to date previously. I will face the fallout when I come to it. The punk in question is more likely to talk big about the whole thing and avoid me in future without letting on to his mates, we shall not meet again. The fact is I don't play their game. Police and public review are in my arsenal: their deal is not getting caught. That they cannot do and still keep a free hand the same time.  <p><p><br><br><h1 align="LEFT"><font size=1>signed Mistyglen</h1></font></p><p><br><h1 align="CENTER"><font size=1>A GREEN Dragon lies beneath!</font></h1>

Anyways, here's what happened...<br>
<br>
One day on the bus he had a pair of cleats he wanted to sell, I said I'd try them out and see if the fit, etc. so he gave them to me to take home for the night. The next day I forgot to bring them to school, and at lunch I was in the back field playing soccer with a bunch of friends (there had to have been a good 100 people around, playing and watching) and suddenly this tool from the bus comes walking out into the field mid game and grabs my arm as I'm jogging past, so I stop, the game stops, everyone stops and watches to see what's up, and this @#%$ tells me to give him his money for the cleats. I told him I forgot them at home, and they are too tight anyways, so he says &quot;I don't care, you said you'd buy them, give me my money&quot;<br>
<br>
By this time all my friends are crowded around, outnumbering his friends 3/1, and he's still being an ass. I said &quot;what about all the money I've loaned you over the years so you can get a chocolate bar here, a pop there? what about that? why not just give me the @#%$ shoes and let it be done at that&quot; and he has the @#%$ nerve to say &quot;yeah, well, you never asked me for the money back&quot; &quot;yes I did, I always did. In fact when I realized you weren't gonna pay me back, I wanted to stop loaning you money, but you would harass and harass and swear up and down how you were gonna pay me back in a couple days. I would end up loaning you the money so you would shut up&quot;<br>
<br>
His response to all this... &quot;you didn't remind me to pay you back after the times you loaned me money, so it doesn't count&quot; &quot;You're @#%$ stupid&quot; I said. At this point I'm thinking maybe he'll go away.
