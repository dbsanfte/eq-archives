<br>
Ulster wasn't sure whether to be relieved or apprehensive at the sight of the gently sloping stone ramp in front of him.   The only shelter for leagues, it much resembled his home town of Halas, carved from rock, gracefully rising from the snow toward an inviting alcove within.  Two fires burned brightly on either side of the alcove sending a warm, white smoke rolling along the top of the cave entrance and into the cold everfrost skyline.  They were plumes much brighter and much stronger than the flames that lit his hometown, but Ulster knew why those fires burned as brightly as they did.<br>
    <br>
Human fat was a preferred fuel for the dwellers within.<br>
<br>
The gnolls called it "shaakok"  When mixed with some standard brewing ingredients it produced a rather intoxicating blend, strong in its effect and stronger in it's unsavory compulsion to drink more. Few knew where the stout came from, or what ingredients lie within, yet many of the humans downed the stout by the mug, cask and barrel.<br>
His grandfather told bizarre stories of the gnolls blending dark magics into the stout, rituals that resulted in the sacrifice of barbarian youth who wandered too far from the homefires.<br>
<br>
But shaakok could also be refined easily enough into a fuel. And it was the burning of that fuel that led more than one weary traveler to his death, unknowingly following the dance of the full, white smoke that originated in the cave in front of him.<br>
<br>
Shaking, Ulster balled his hands into fists, and then unballed them in an unsuccessfull effort to restore some circulation to the tips of his fingers.  He missed the warmth of his homefire.  He craved the fur blankets of his homestead and the fiery embrace of his blood-sister.  <br>
<br>
Finding his mind drifting, Ulster refocused himself on the fight at hand.  He would freeze to death heading back to Halas now, thats why the elders had made the guildetest this way.  Thats why they called this test the bloodfire.<br>
Once you were on it there was no return unless you completed your quests.<br>
<br>
Drawing his poorly forged knife, Ulster uncurled his seven and a half foot frame and stood upright, careful to keep himself blended with the snows.  His hand was barely able to grip his knife now, and despite his tremendously think skin, cold was beginning to wear on him.  His heart was pumping hard, he could actually feel it beating in his chest as it fought to keep his immense frame from going under.<br>
<br>
Looking up the ramp he searched for movement, tensing every muscle in his body, barely moving his head to look about. He had become good at moving through the snow fluidly, barely leaving a trail in his wake. Hardly disturbing the snow, to the untrained eye it appeared a snowdrift...little more.<br>
<br>
Reaching the snowline where the flakes melted on the rock, Ulster carefully pulled off his white cloak and turned it twisting it so the dark brown bear hide within shown outward.  Freezing in place he looked for sudden motion that indicated he had been spotted.  Finding none, Ulster stayed low kneeling along the floor of the ramp hugging its side and crept up to where the elders had told him guards were usually posted.  Bringing his cloak up he commenced the stalking of his prey. <br>
                   <br>
An hour later Ulster traversed the 20 yard journey.  It might as well have been 20 leagues for the strain it put on his frame.  He was within range of the guardpost now, but dared not look directly up, as creatures oft had an ability to sense eyes upon them. Daring a look at the crest of the ramp after what seemed and endless forever, Ulster got the target he wanted a lone guard, sniffing at the winds.<br>
<br>
<i>Sniffing?</i> He thought.<br>
<br>
Than it occurred to him, the scent of the bear cloak might not be enough to mask his robust barbarian odor. <br>
<br>
Freezing mid sniff the gnoll stopped and drew his rusty scimitar. He was cloaked in a red cape undoubtedly a trophy from one of his victims, however Ulster was able to quickly assess him.  He was half his size, but Ulster knew better than to judge an enemy by girth alone. Its muscles were thin but wiry, and appeared to have a surprsing reach.  It stalked limberly as if good at running and leaping. And his knuckles and forearms were almost a solid mass of callous undoubtedly as hard as the stone he walked on.<br>
<br>
Ulster would have to get inside his reach and down him quick.  Almost casually the gnoll turned and walked inside.<br>
<br>
Fearing he would get others, Ulster leapt out from his hiding crouch and in three paces was on him.  Slamming his left shoulder into the gnoll's gut he lifted up the gnoll like a child's toy and pinned him against the cave wall, three feet off the ground.  The gnoll in response having dropped his scimitar, slammed his calloused fist into Ulster's temple, getting enough leverage to momentarily stun the barbarian.<br>
<br>
Hitting the ground running, the gnoll started to go deeper into the cave. Ulster reached out with his offhand grabbing the cape and in a twist and jerk motion yanked the gnoll back to him, and onto his waiting shank. Quickly Ulster wrapped the cape around it's head to muzzle it's dying yelp and brought the blade deeper into the gnolls spine.  Squirming, twisting the gnoll flailed wildly, ripping its nails out in the cave wall as it tried to escape.<br>
<br>
A quick yank up produced a 2 foot gash in the gnolls back, its fluids spilling all over the cave floor, sopping themselves into the dirt which seemed to devour them. <br>
<br>
Throwing the gnoll onto his shoulder, Ulster ran as adeptly and quietly as possible out of the cave entrance dragging the corpse to a shadowed corner.<br>
<br>
Flinging it to the floor he worked quickly.  Cutting open its chest, he warmed his hands for a brief spell in the chest of his victim, then withdrew the heart.  Getting out a glass vial he drained it of fluids, crushing the heart into a fleshy pulp. Then opening it's mouth Ulster rammed his dagger into the upper gumline and ripping downward pulled out its fang.  Dropping it in the jar, he froze and listened.<br>
<br>
It appeared he had not yet been heard.  <br>
<br>
Cleaning the excess blood off him with the gnolls tattered cape, Ulster lifted the body above his head and flung it into the bonfire that lit the cave entrance.  Sizzling and popping the gnoll's corpse sent an acrid black smoke twisting into the air.  Right now his village would see this at home and rejoyce, and drink in his honor.  <br>
<br>
Ulster crept out of the cave entrance much quicker, sailing lightly on the thoughts of home.  He would wear the tooth in honor of his first enemy kill, and the blood he gathered would be blended with the ices of permafrost to form his warpaint, enchanted and blessed by the shamans, and applied by his blood sister.<br>
<br>
Ulster glided through the snows of everfrost thinking of little more than the fireside, the embrace of his blood sister and the welcoming smiles of home...<br>
