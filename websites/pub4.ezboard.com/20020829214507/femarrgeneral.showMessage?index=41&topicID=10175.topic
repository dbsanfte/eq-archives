<br>
If you cant kill Aaryonar, you have no business in NToV.  Period.  As a couple people said already, Aaryonar is there for a reason, we did not create him and put him there, VI did.  WHY?  Because they obviously wanted to make it less trivial than the other wings of ToV.  Do you have to kill a big nasty to get into West wing?  NO!  The named there are relatively hidden so you can avoid them if you can't do them (except for LtK at the zone out, and port outs get you around her).  Do you have to kill a big nasty to get into HoT?  NO!  Again, the named there can be easily avoided by guilds who may be capable of farming HoT for armour, but are not quite ready for that &quot;next step&quot;.   <br>
<br>
Aaryonar is NOT an easy fight!  You CANNOT get past him to the rest of the dragons if he is up.  You can not CoTH past him.  There is no safe place to do that.  You can not run past him invis, he will see you.  Good CoV faction will not get you in past him.  NToV stuff is kos to everyone.<br>
<br>
I don't care for lengthy rotations either.  They suck.  I agree with everyone on that.  However, sometimes there needs to be order and respect, and if a rotation assists that end, then so be it.  In the case of NToV, there are only 4 guilds in there right now who can kill Aaryonar, and have demenstrated that by doing so.  Yes, the stuff in North is a week spawn time, longer than Trak or VS.  However, even if it were ffa, it would still be a week spawn, you cant change that.  When Affliction started killing in north, we were the only guild there, that is true.  Not more than a couple weeks later, KX killed Aary for the first time.  The two guilds came to an agreement about the spawns that worked well for both guilds.  Shortly after, DG offed Aary and entered NToV.  At this point, KX decided that they did not want to have to wait an extra week for the shot at north, and that is when these problems started.<br>
<br>
Then, a couple of smaller guilds, who want to be in NToV, but who could not kill Aary, started going in behind the guilds who could and attempting to kill named, after one of the other guilds had killed Aary.  Now, I am not bashing or flaming here at all so dont take it that way.  RoD proved the day after this happened, that they could indeed kill Aary, and kudos to them for a job well done.  But I agree with Breus in that they should never have killed Dagarn untill they had killed Aary.  The other guild in question, just pretty much walked in, yes, they had to kill some drakes and some flurry drakes, but um, comparatively speaking, that is easy, so, so what?  Killing some drakes and walking to PoM with out killing even one single named, is just wrong.  This does not, in any way, make you 'capable of killing in NToV' all it does is say that you can kill normal West or HoT stuff.  And not to belittle the guilds who farm there, but, um, so what?  <br>
<br>
What is the big deal about getting a full spawn every month anyway?  I would rather know that once a month, I get to go in, have all the named up at once, and kill them all.  This is much better than ffa, and going in to find that a guild farmed the hell out of one or two dragons and left the rest up because they did not need that loot anymore.  I mean, how many times can you only kill, for expample, Dagarn and Lord Koi 'Doken(sp) ?  before you no longer need those two dragons loot tables.  It is sooo much easier to just go in and get what you need.  And eventually, the guilds doing North, will be done, just like Magi and MF were done, and the up and coming guilds will have it to themselves.<br>
<br>
And lastly, again, not the opionion of my guild, even though some may agree with me on this.  This matter should be taken care of in a polite, adult and honorable manner between the officers of the 4 guilds involved.  It should really not be here on this board at all.  AND, IF YOU ARE NOT INVOLVED, OR NOT A MEMBER OF SAID 4 GUILDS INVOLVED, AND HAVE NOT KILLED AARYONAR OR ARE NOT EVEN REMOTELY ABLE TO EVEN THINK ABOUT ATTEMPTING AARYONAR, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!  YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS EVEN STICKING YOUR NOSE IN TO THE TOPIC AT ALL!  Alll you are doing is stiring the pot.  If you are that bored, go get a life or something.  Stay out of it, let it be handles by those who have business there in the first place.<br>
