  I don't know, guys... why is this terribly bad?<br>
<br>
  It allows people with strong resources to obtain their epics when they may not normally be able to do so.  For the most part, I would think, the epic pieces which are sold are gained when a_Mob is killed more time for it's loot than for it's epic value (case in point, Venril Santhir).<br>
<br>
  One could say that one doesn't deserve the Druid or Ranger epic unless one's guild is capable of killing VS, but one can also say there is no real reason to draw guild lines and that lines of friendship can have a guild help an individual in the slaying of a mob for an epic item.<br>
<br>
  There's no real reason to require that an individual build a guild over the course of months, even years, up to the standard of killing epic mobs, all it really takes are friends.  This has happend and will continue to do so... people with friends in powerful guilds have an edge, even if they are not themselves in the guild.<br>
<br>
  With that hopefully accepted, then comes the question of selling such items.  Epic items have value, the value of that is determined by the market, prices are set and epic pieces and bits are sold and traded.  Traded in some instances when two guilds have differing epic items, sold in many instances.  Sold to produce guildfunds, most likely.  It is hard to grasp the intense expenditure an end game guild experiences.  Nothing short of peridots will suffice, continual purchase of stones, continual use of amassed guildfunds to finance the purchase of needed items.<br>
<br>
  I'm working completely off a limb here, trying to guess the arguments before they arise.  I can promise, though... regardless of what logical traps you might set for me, the sale of epic items will continue.  G'day and have fun in the game.<br>

If a guild that is capable of killing thse uber mobs wants to sell the spoils of victory then so be it. People can basically buy then if they want to or get the fuck outta dodge if they dont, there really aint no big fucking morality issue here. Too many people treat EQ like its some kind of bizzare religion and go on about what shud be traded and what shudnt be traded too damn much. I have one rule if there is a market out there then why not sell? I mean honestly do you expect MS and Da'kor to just hand over these pieces off uber mobs to people who need them without some kind of payment? Look at the time and effort that goes into killing them in the first place, its only right that they profit off of their efforts.  <p><img SRC="http://www.geocities.com/mysigs2000/jerusig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cendan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/7/01 11:18:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selling Epics?</span><hr size=1> I thought about this and I see both sides to some degree.<br>

I could understand if those guilds said that no one who didnt earn the epic didnt deserve it and they destroyed the extra pieces.<br>
<br>
I understand people selling items, even see people trading items but for some reason I see epic items as different. Why? Don't know just think that epic is different.<br>
<br>
I know that I want no part in selling epic items, and I am looking forward to when we take out some of these mobs soon. Hoping their are other guilds out there who will be a little selfless when their time comes too. <p>Cendan Tankenpriest<br>

i see nothing wrong with selling the epic pieces, alot of people dont have time to dedicate to major stuff like that, hell alot of people cant even make a plane raid after the servers come up cuz half the guild is at work. its also kinda pointless for the guild killing venril to let the things rot, they spent their time to kill him,and deserve something for it, but if they wanna be super nice and give it away thats really cool too ^_^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushinryuumoondancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shinryuu Moondancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/8/01 3:04:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selling Epics?</span><hr size=1> I have to agree with Maeghant.<br>

If you can affort it, and not able to obtain this on your own rightnow... why not<br>
I see no difference with other items, except these items are related with Epic's.<br>

And when the time comes for other guild's to hit those mob's, i personally think that guilds like MS and Da`Kor act like gentlements .... and give you the change to get these items <p>Shinryuu the wanderer

<br>
We're also trading our spare Trak BP's and such for Epic pieces or other rare no drop loot we need, like Cazic skin, Mage staves, Necro Focus.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't see a problem with this. I got my epic with the help from Affliction. And i gave them my Staff of Battle as a thanks. that could be treaded as a trade.<br>
They were in PoH, i had trouble getting my hand because it's a rare drop and the plane is often occupied. The Staff of Battle i gave them was an item they would have some trouble getting back then.<br>
<br>
<br>
If a guild don't need a piece really. as in far away from completing an epic, or perhaps see them needing a trak bp more for example trading between guilds would, at least, in my opinion be a good way to help each other out.<br>
<br>
example, Guild A can kill Trak, have a few spare BP's, but have a hard time getting a rare drop from Cazic for instance. while guild B, is killing Cazic alot but have no chance agaist trak, this would be a nice scenario where guild A could trade their trak bp to guild B, and guild A would egt their epic done where guild B have a trak bp they could not get yet. <p><A HREF=http://www.dakor.net/profiles/pview.asp?x=85 ><img border=0 src=http://www.geocities.com/dafreako/eqpics/catsig1.gif HEIGHT=193 WIDTH=271></img></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 691<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/8/01 3:58:19 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/mysigs2000/jeru.jpg HEIGHT=213 WIDTH=163></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selling Epics?</span><hr size=1> Very Good explanation Cattie, I agree entirely. <p><img SRC="http://www.geocities.com/mysigs2000/jerusig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 858<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/8/01 5:49:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Selling Epics?</span><hr size=1> I agree entirely with Maeghant on this one (no really), and further i know of one good friend who was given her epic piece free of charge by one of the aforementioned guilds so its simply not true that they are out to screw people over for the peices, and even if you paid 25k its still a fair price (IMHO)<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with 2 people/guilds trading things that they each would like to aquire and further i take heart that Meaghant has at last (and wonders if the irony will be lost to longstanding readers of this board) totally reversed his stance on high level trading of things that are hard to obtain.<br>

Remember so very very long ago when it was like Da`kor and Ice Clan only down in lower guk killing the mobs and sellling stuff to those who couldnt get it, just like this.  It set a standard that was exactly as described above by meg.  Only, later when more and more guilds became capable, we started seeing all the flame wars about farmers and stuff because everyone wanted in on the action and it suddenly was not about being helpful, but became about who could cash in.<br>
<br>
But then... that will happen anyway, so you can hardly blame Da`kor for getting their goods now while there is little competition.  They are pretty noble chaps (and chappettes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) so i wouldnt think they would farm an epic mob while another guild is trying to kill it for their own member's epic.  That is were i would draw the line for what is wrong.  <br>
<br>
(my general thoughts for everyone) Get the stuff you can for you and yours, but need comes before greed.  Let those who dont have but can get or are trying to get have a shot at getting it.<br>

<br>
Am I ashamed?  Nope.  Am I a little bit disappointed that I can’t say my Epic Weapons were "totally" completed by my own guild and I?  A little bit.  <br>
<br>
I will complete my Epic Quest and receive the Swiftwind and Earthcaller in the next few days and will proudly wield them everywhere I go.  Sure it would have been nice to do the entire quest myself – but I have a life outside of this godforsaken game.  As do most of my guildmates.  This is not a slam on any of the Uber Guilds or meant to mean you guys don’t have lives outside of EQ – many of you have been playing since Beta and have come by your current position because of the time you put in and a hardcore commitment that others simply cannot make for one reason or another.<br>
<br>
I have not been playing that long and quite honestly I am not as hardcore as most.  I’m 33 years old – I have a wife (who does not appreciate the time commitment necessary to EQ), I have a business to run – hell I have a dog to walk!  I can only commit to long drawn out raids (6+ hours) maybe once or twice a week.  <br>
<br>
I used to play EQ in the EC tunnel back when I was in the Lions Denizens – I have relatively good equipment for my level.  Ultimately – 25kp to 50kp (well maybe 50kp is getting pretty crazy) is not a huge amount of plat if you work at trading.  In the end – what I paid for the stone is VERY minimal given the stats of the quest reward.  Look at what people pay for a Lam or CSS – compare the stats to the Ranger epics.  <br>
<br>
Sure – it’d be great if everyone playing EQ had the commitment, resources and drive to be VS, Sky Isle 7 or Trak capable like Da`Kor, MS and SF – but many of us don’t.  <br>
<br>
As an analogy (since I just got my big brown envelope in the mail from him and it is fresh in my mind) – I “COULD” spend hours on end studying and going back to school to become a CPA (or at least gain that knowledge) and do all of my own business taxes. OR – I can find myself a good accountant I can trust that has already put in the time and effort to get to the point in his life that my business taxes are a breeze for him – and pay him to do it for me and be comfortable that it will be done right and for what I consider a fair price.   <br>
<br>
I can then spend my time doing things I find enjoyable.<br>

That’s my 2cp for what it’s worth.  I am sure many others will disagree and that's fine - you play your game - I'll play mine.<br>
<br>
p.s. - it IS only a game.  <br>
<br>
p.p.s. - sorry again to all the Da`Kor peeps I pestered the living shit outta for the last month or so - Vendrix, Tsunamineko and Kerrol.  I know I was a royal pain in the ass. :) <br>

What I want to avoid is people going there ONLY for the loot that they can sell. Most the time the good stuff ends up in the hands of twinks. <p>Cendan Tankenpriest<br>

The mobs that drop epic quest items aren't all done just for that reason. The ones that are sometimes, are the ones that have shitty drop rates (see. ct/inno/vs (wiz staff))<br>
<br>
VS - legs / epic - wiz staff + rng/dru stones<br>
Trak - bp's + stuff / epic - trak guts<br>
CT - done mainly for skin, which is extrememly rare so no one does him just for the fact of getting a skin to sell<br>
Inno - stuff / epic - rng something and mage staff, again, mage staff extremley rare, no one is doing inno just to sell it<br>
Various Kunark dragons - drop scales for epics, they are done for other reasons so extra scales can arise ofcourse<br>
<br>
No one is farmining epic items, but when you do VS and he drops 2 stones EVERY TIME, and you kill kunark dragons and get a scale or two off of each of em, you only have so many druids/rangers/warriors *shrug*.. <br>
<br>
I personally don't see why this topic even came up, the only &quot;extra&quot; items are VS stones and some scales, and are guilds that get them expected to just give them away to people who can't kill them?<br>
<br>
Might as well use it for guild funds, any idea how much peridots and other stuff costs when your doing raiding like EVERY day? Hell I used about 60-70 peridots last VP raid, we tried hoshkar a few times so every time I had to rebuff ~12 peple or so... (next time I'm only going to use less since we are going to BRUTALY BEAT HOSHKAR DOWN!) Point is, if guilds get extra epic items, they aren't farminig them for that purpose as you can see, and the money goes toward needed guild funds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usalashpenumbra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salash Penumbra</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.cnsj.net/guild/10pixel.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/8/01 10:06:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> All this talk of VS stones and dragon scales... where's the hordes of Crowns of Elemental Mastery I'm looking for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=1590.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=1590.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=1590.topic&start=61&stop=61>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2419.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=2415.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=1590.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=1590.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1590.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1590.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br>
