I LOVE it when this stuff happens.  <br>

<br>
I will make a prediction right now in front of you all. <br>
<br>
Every speech the Prez makes from now to election will mention the 'war' whatever<br>
that means at the time. Its the only issue he gains support on.<br>
<br>
The Prez will order an invasion of something somewhere before the election,<br>
most likely Iraq in October. We will NEVER stop hearing about it. <br>
<br>
It wont make a damn bit of difference to the unemployed. This Prez is in serious trouble and I laugh at his party. It didnt have to go down this way. They never learn. <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

When the economy is bad, it must be those damn gun weilding, hot headed, opinionated, NRA supporting Republicans.<br>

Now, I am not enfatuated(sp) with the government either, but until there is substantial evidence to link the Republican Party to a dwindling economy, I am going to think before assuming the Republicans did it.<br>
<br>
Maybe if the Government wasnt giving so much money to crack addicts squirting out babies they could do something about it.<br>

Democrats: Little wusses with no opinions on anything, because if they had opinions it would offend people.  People who believe that guns are the root of all evil and there are no two ways about it.<br>
<br>
Republicans:  Gun weilding, baby eating, crazies who would like to revert the US to an old west style state because most of the head Republicans are old enough to have lived back then.<br>
<br>
Independents: They have a senator in Vermont, they must be pedophile supporting gay leaders.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the Democrats havent had their good share of times, but I AM saying that i get cranky when people assume that whenever something bad happens it must be those Wacky Republicans.<br>

It is that attitude that helps keep the political apathy going which has been plaguing our polls for the last 20ish years.  People make wild assumptions one a card that they hold...a card which says &quot;Democrat&quot;, &quot;Republican&quot;, &quot;Independant&quot;, etc.  Grow up and get your head out of your ass.  Must be awful dark in there, but that would explain your short sightedness.<br>
<br>
Second, obviously my assumption that you have an inkling of an idea on how the market *naturally* goes up and *naturally* goes down is my fault.  Pure and simple.  The market is on an average incline since the 9-11 attacks.  That has mostly nothing to do with our <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> President</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (Yes, that's spelled:  P-r-e-s-i-d-e-n-t..Go ahead, I know you can!).  We, as a country, will have good times and we will have bad times.  When the market crashes as a direct result of what our President does, then you can start talking and someone might actually believe you are competent enough to know what you are talking about.<br>
<br>
I try not to make blanket statements myself. Such as: &quot;All Democrats are large-government-loving, tree-hugging, politically-correct, minority-coddling assholes&quot;. Why do I try to not do that? Well, you see, it's because it makes me look like a close-minded 12 y/o that is repeating what his mommy or daddy keeps saying to the TV.  <br>
<br>
Have an opinion! It's healthy! However, don't let your foot get in the way of your mouth.  It gets rather messy.<br>
<br>
And though this will likely be brought up anyway...Yes, I am a Catholic &amp; a Republican.  That definately does *not* stop me from listening to other peoples opinion regardless of their political or religious affiliations.  Try it sometime, Chiteng.  You'll be surprised at what you can learn. <p><center>

I certainly think so, and as much as it pains me to say it, I woulda prefered to see the Robot win (actually, would have preferred McCain, but that is first-past-the-post for you).  Has he caused the poor economy? I really don't think it is that clear cut.  He has sent very conflicting messages with a lot of his economic policies, and yeah, he is more in bed with corporate interests than I personally think is healthy for a president, but when all is said and done, for better or for worse, he has surrounded himself with people who are all pretty bright, and he is at his heart a moral man who really does want to do what is best for his country.  We may disagree on what that best is, but I cannot fault a man for being devoted to a goal like that.<br>
<br>
Qool... do a little deeper digging than what you hear on Rush Limbaugh, however, neh?  In terms of comparisons, the Clinton Administration was far more open to the concept of globalization than Bush has been (steel tariffs vs NAFTA, anyone?), and did a lot more with the world community at large than Bush or his administration has done.  Americans post 9/11 were shocked and dismayed to realize that they are not the benevelontly considered superpower they felt themselves to be, and in large part it is because of the actions committed by people such as Wolfowitz (sp), Bush himself, and the rest of his administration with the notable and arguable exception of Powell.  Bush, or those in his administration, have done more to harm international views of America, and more to harm our standing in the international community than Clinton ever did.  I will not get into domestic politics with you, because frankly most of what I consider progress it sounds like you would greet as the 3 Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and vice-versa.  Argue that Clinton was a snake; I will not disagree.  When all is said and done, however, in my view he did a lot more to further America's interests than Bush has done, specifically in the long turn.<br>

You put in $10 today and get back $100 at the end of the month! Woo hoo. Works great until the bubble bursts. Every month you have to raise 10x the money you did last month to pay the 10x more people that joined, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Well, its not exactly the same, but social security is damn close in my opinion. People are now, and will be in the future, be getting more back from SS than they put in. Its that simple folks. Could you cover it if you invested wisely? Maybe. Its going to bust folks. Its just a matter of time. There are more baby boomers than tax payers younger than them right now... and they are creeping up on retirement.<br>
<br>
If you want to force an retirement supplement on someone, that is fine. (Since people have a hard time saving.) But make it a 1 on 1 thing. And give the poor smuck some control on how it is invested.<br>
<br>
As far as the political party affiliation goes, I don't care. All I want is a guy that is a straight shooter that is smart enough to surrond him/herself with people a lot smarter than him/herself. From there just make the best decision you can on the information you have. That's a leader. <br>
<br>
When George Jr. was asked if he got a DUI, he response was basicly &quot;you betcha.&quot; That's integrity. And the American people respected that and let it go and still elected him. People, no matter how good you think you are, make dumb ass mistakes. The real test of character is living up to them. <br>
<br>
Is he the best choice? Probably not. Good old Mr. Powell would have been much better in my opinion. (Another person with integrity and leadership skills.)<br>
<br>
I was in the Marine Corps during the entire Clinton reign. We, and I mean 99% of us, despised that man. But we kept our mouth shut because you have to respect the office and not the man. Doesn't say much for &quot;The Commander in Chief&quot;. Most people would not have wanted to follow that man to the 7/11. But we had to. Sucks, huh?<br>
<br>
Straight up, he was a dirtbag from the word go, and I don't care if he called himself a Democrate, a Whig, or a Confederate. The man was a disgrace to his people because he did not have the balls to admit when he was wrong, the balls to make hard decisions without sugar coating them first, nor the common sense that there are always people out there a lot smarter than yourself and you might want to &quot;surrond yourself with greatness&quot; as the Romans always said. (I know they fell, but that was a currency debasement issue and a totally different thread.)<br>
<br>
My point? Clinton was a mistake. I'll give him one thing - he put the nation in the black on the budget. (So he'd make a good Ferrengi on Star Trek.)<br>
<br>
Bush might be simple as all hell, but he's honest, he knows how to lead, he got the balls to make hard decisions, and he actually has respect from the people that work for him. <br>
<br>
One more thing, you will not see the effects that Bush Jr. has had on the economy for several years. Anyone that has read Economy 101 knows that.<br>

Manufacturing was up, equities were up. The dollar was strong compared to the Pound and Yen. Clinton seemed to be an apt businessman and a frugal planner.<br>

From an outside view Bush seems to very easy with the idea of war. I won't say trigger happy but he doesn't appear to have the tolerance that other presidents ( barring his father ) have had. This is not necessarily a bad thing as America has to be shown not to be weak but if you're going to say Clinton was a bad president because he chose a more diplomatic approach I'd say that was an error.<br>

I think Bush is doing a good job, except where Israel is concerned. But thats nothing to do with this. <br>
<br>
I think blaming the current politics for the economy at the moment is ludicris.<br>
<br>
9/11 shook the american confidence pretty hard.<br>
<br>
Only on very few occasions have politics had any directly noticiable effect on the american economy. For the most part the economy is an independant entity with its own strong time and weak times, ebbs and flows. Most of these fluctuations come from the outlook of the investors. And since the investors are human, they let outside factors affect their judgements. <br>
<br>
The confidence shatter caused by 9/11 has some pretty long ranging effects, especially on an economy that was at the time on a slower pace than it had been.<br>
<br>
Winning a war would probably reboost our confidence, though I would be impressed if we can ever actually have a victory in this war. <br>
<br>
When politics do affect the economy the lag effect is 2-3 years. So the slowdown that was happening at the time of 9/11 would have been a result of Clinton politics if it was politically caused at all.<br>
<br>
If Bush's politics do manage to turn the economy around, we will probably see the results during the next Clinton presidency.<br>

<br>
But I don't know what rock you were hiding under last(or any) election year when every bloody economist in the world was saying that you couldn't attribute the economy to Clinton policy..it was all part of a growth pattern started by Reagan...<br>
<br>
I don't believe any of it. <br>
<br>
Most economist agree that any election will boost the economy. At the same time they agree that outside of sweeping reforms (which are nearly impossible in todays political environment) politics don't have much effect on the economy and it is in fact the other way around.<br>
<br>
The Economy effects politics. More precisely: we blame politics for the economy and a bad economy will result in political changes.<br>
<br>
The biggest factor that the president can play on the economy is how he talks about it. If the president says we will have it rough, the economy will stumble. If the president says we can expect to see significant growth...the economy will get a push upward...<br>
<br>
Those effects are immediate.<br>
<br>
But the time it takes for policy to effect the economy is 2-3 years, mostly because from the time a policy is announced to the time it takes effect is about 1-2 years.<br>
<br>
Most economists study the economy to see how we will fare in the upcoming months. Those that study politics are trying to make more money and sell a book or something. Economics is boring, politics are still boring but sell more books.<br>
<br>
The single biggest factor in the economy is the outlook of investors. If they are happy and positive the economy will improve. <br>
<br>
The second biggest factor in the economy is innovation. If something new hits the market that everyone has to have, that drives the economy forward.<br>
<br>
Presidential statements have an effect on the first of those two factors, but in the big picture it is the economy that affects the economy most, not politics.<br>
