But I have read a lot of them. And I form my opinion on who is obviously in the right and who is being an ass. Hmm. Could be I am as guilty as others on going by appearances.<br>
<br>
Since I am in CD, one of the founding members, and married to one of the officers, father-in-law to be of another, please know this up front. Also know that Thrasy is Enantiomer's rl brother, Aziline his rl gf. <br>
<br>
First Enantiomer has in the past done an incredible amount of good for our guild. He was our main tank, and one of the reasons we were able to do some nice successful raids. I spent a good portion of my time in groups with him and we had a great time. We played well together. Extremely well. One group, with Tokum, Truely, Redawen, Daydrem, Enantiomer and myself broke Fear in 30 minutes for the guild. We were surprised we could do it that fast. Great to have him at your back.<br>
<br>
Iizzard, regardless of how his posts look (I know, they are a mess) is one of the nicest people I know. He has never been less than honest to my knowledge, and is extremely generous in game. He has never been a loot whore. Ever. Really. Ever. He is also witty and fun to be around. If you judge from posts here, I can see where it looks like he did something wrong. But notice he did not post the sale himself, his friend did. I disagree with that action. What he was actually guilty of was THINKING of selling it. (I know, some posts supposedly made as to it being sold before others were posted public).<br>
<br>
One major thing I see from Enantiomer and his family, and others as well, is that when arguments are made, the following posts rarely show consideration of the arguments, or acknowleding points that are valid, only taking issue with the points that from their perspective are wrong.<br>
<br>
For me, knowing very well who these people are and the kind of people they are, the decision is based on not whether someone can hammer a fact home, but what are their intentions in making that fact known. I have no doubt that Enantiomer believed he was doing the right thing. Or that members of his family believed in him. The point though is that I have seen him lose his temper before. Not a nice thing. He has great disdain for those that disagree with him. He has set up raids and then not shown up because he was mad at someone or something. Understand, it is not always known to me what he is angry at or why.<br>
 But Enantiomer on the warpath is not to be denied. When he is right, you CANNOT disagree with him. It makes no difference what viewpoint you take, he cannot be swayed. The attacks become personal, he takes things said personally. Even a suggestion that he might be wrong is taken as an affront to the respect he feels he is due.<br>
<br>
The decisions made by the officers of CD was not a case of doing the &quot;easy&quot; thing. It was debated a lot. I had some say in it, as did others in tells and on the boards. But not a vote. It was done by the officers, to remove someone showing destructive behavior to the guild. And to all our friends as members of the guild. Not to protect Iizzard. He stands on his own for this, with moral support from his friends, but still responsible for what actions he takes as are all of us.<br>
 This was the first item of such large value to drop that was not a really needed accessory for someone in the guild.  None of us were prepared for what followed, as none of us are people that are anything but interested in having fun and sharing with all our friends. <br>
<br>
Rules were made, and posted on the board, but you know rules never cover every situation. I personally felt that if you legitimately won an item on a raid, it was then yours to do with as you please, provided it was not needed by another guildie and you just entered the roll to sell it in spite of that. I see this is not the consenus of most of you, so I will correct my thinking on this.<br>
I know some of this won't matter to many of you. No problem. But I do want to say that if you were to watch our guild chat (with the exception of the last few days), had been with us on a guild raid, you would see that this is really a great guild, with great people, having a wonderful time together. <br>
<br>
And for mentions of Truely being a part of a conspiracy with Redawen to get rid of someone. If you have EVER talked to Truely in the game, and god knows she talks to a lot of people (I am in the same room with her and can't get her to answer me because she's too busy typing. Sometimes I have to send her a /tell), know that how she treated you is how she treats everyone. With love, respect and fun for all. It would be impossible for her to conspire to do something like this. <br>

Iizzard, I didn't like your attitude in ToV, and I don't think I was wrong for not liking it.  It is shown here that you are just a d00d who DOES think he's too 'l337' for anyone else.  Sucks that you deprived a deserving person of an awesome item, doesn't suck that you are getting a bad rep out of karma. <p><a href="http://www.radianteclipse.net"><img src="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/geraldt2/images/Moltaenya.jpg" border="0"></a><br>Officer of <a href="http://www.radianteclipse.net/">Radiant Eclipse</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=88689">My Warrior</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=88700">My Wizard</a>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How to Prepare Insects for Cooking</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
  <br>
Those who are accustomed to eating animals probably know that most animals must be killed, cleaned, and cooked before one can eat them. The case is similar with insects. While there are many people in other countries who prefer to eat insects live and raw, and while it is true that you could probably get the most nutrients that way, I prefer food that won't crawl off my plate. I have tried eating live ants and mealworms, and in fact present a &quot;recipe&quot; for live insect consumption below; however, I would advise that beginning insect eaters start with cooked insects.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> To prepare a batch of crickets or mealworms:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Take the desired quantity of live insects, rinse them off and then pat them dry. This procedure is easy to do with mealworms, but fairly hard to do with crickets. To do so with crickets, pour them all into a colander and cover it quickly with a piece of wire screening or cheesecloth. Rinse them, then dry them by shaking the colander until all the water drains. Then put the crickets or mealworms in a plastic bag and put them in the freezer until they are dead but not frozen. Fifteen minutes or so should be sufficient. Then take them out and rinse them again. You don't really have to clean mealworms, though if you want, you can chop off their heads. Cricket's heads, hind legs, and wing cases can be removed according to personal preference; I like doing so, since cricket legs tend to get stuck in your teeth. You are now ready to use the insects in all kinds of culinary treats!<br>
<br>
_____________________________________________________<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mealworm Chocolate Chip Cookies</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
  <br>
1/2 cup butter <br>
1/2 cup brown sugar <br>
1/2 cup white sugar <br>
1 egg <br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla <br>
1 cup all purpose flour <br>
1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
1/2 teaspoon baking soda <br>
1/2 cup oats <br>
1/2 cup chocolate chips <br>
1/4 cup mealworm flour <br>
Cream butter well, then mix in sugar, egg, vanilla flour, salt, baking soda, chocolate chips, oats, and mealworm flour. Drop batter by the teaspoonful on a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees farenheit. This recipe doesn't have much in the way of palpable insect content, but is an excellent way to introduce others (or yourself!) to entomophagy. Even many rather squeamish people will try mealworm cookies, since the cookie format doesn't look &quot;gross&quot; to most people, and since it is rather difficult to actually taste the mealworms, though they enrich the cookie with a somewhat nutty flavor and extra protein.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> To make insect flour:</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Spread your cleaned insects out on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Set your oven 200 degrees and dry insects for approximately 1-3 hours. When the insects are done, they should be fairly brittle and crush easily. Take your dried insects and put them into a blender or coffee grinder, and grind them till they are about consistency of wheat germ. Use in practically any recipe! Try sprinkling insect flour on salads, add it to soups, your favorite bread recipe, on a boat, with a goat, etc.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Chocolate Covered Crickets</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
  <br>
25 adult crickets <br>
Several squares of semisweet chocolate <br>
Prepare the crickets as described above. Bake at 250 degrees until crunchy (the time needed varies from oven to oven). Heat the squares of semi sweet chocolate in a double boiler until melted. Dip the dry roasted crickets in the melted chocolate one by one, and then set the chocolate covered crickets out to dry on a piece of wax paper. Enjoy! This is a little time consuming to make, but definitely worth it...the crickets are deliciously crunchy!<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Ant Brood Tacos</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
  <br>
2 tablespoons butter or peanut oil? <br>
1/2 pound ant larvae and pupae <br>
3 serrano chilies, raw, finely chopped <br>
1 tomato, finely chopped <br>
Pepper, to taste <br>
Cumin, to taste <br>
Oregano, to taste <br>
1 handful cilantro, chopped <br>
Taco shells, to serve <br>
Heat the butter or oil in a frying pan and fry the larvae or pupae. Add the chopped onions, chilies, and tomato, and season with salt. Sprinkle with ground pepper, cumin, and oregano, to taste. Serve in tacos and garnish with cilantro. (Not living in an area exceptionally prolific with ants, I have never been able to try this recipe. But it sounds perfectly delicious! I found it in 'Creepy Crawly Cuisine', an excellent recipe book.)<br>

<br>
The latter makes sense yours did not.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
Happy to admit it. It appears that the thread Tokum is referring to in Officer's only is gone.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
I admit I have no explanation for why that particular thread is gone. I am a man and I am not going to cover anything up or lie or try to cloud matters with tangents. Again, my experience with the EZboard is that it resets stats when a thread is deleted, so I assumed nothing had been changed. If it was removed, it must have been removed more than two days ago.<br>
<br>
Now, Enantiomer may I ask you why you removed this post? Or should we just take you for your word that nothing was deleted and everything you say is the god’s honest truth? If so I am having a really hard time especially since your web page link is so cut up a line here, a line there, here a line, there a line, where are all the line lines? (Sorry it was there I had to)<br>
<br>
I would love nothing better then to believe you Enantiomer but as a person in the guild that has seen and experienced your temper, I cannot with the fragmented data you submitted, unfortunately you have control of all the data on this issue so some of us will never see the post you deleted, just the people that voted to remove you have this knowledge...<br>
<br>
Yes I am friends with Iizzard he has been a friend of mine for a long time, and anyone that knew Iizzard would know this is not like him, However, things were done and said that we really wont know about unless there is a log of any and all conversations between Rexfel, Enantiomer, and Iizzard in game, which unfortunately only you have and we have already seen your butchered copy of. <br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
You know why I cut it up? Because half of his dribble I couldn't understand and anyone with IQ higher than the quantity of weed you smoke a day wouldn't either.<br>
<br>
Yes we know why you cut it up Rexfel. Let us see it all half the people, if not all of them here have read enough of Iizzard’s posts by now to make a good guess about what is being said.<br>
<br>
Anyway Enantiomer, to make a long story short you weren’t Kicked because you brought this to the attention of the guild, this has been a long time coming and you just didn’t figure it out, your continual abuse of your power just got to much for people to bare anymore, plus the added fact that I think in your pursuit of “Enantiomer’s_conspiracy_theory_01” you didn’t take the time to listen to other opinions or ideas other then the one you had already formed, you just bashed anyone that came along that objected with your opinion, and thus you were removed.<br>
<br>
Enantiomer I ask you the same as I did Thrasy before he stopped posting on the board what exactly do you plan on going away with here? This matter will be handled as it should have been in the first place, it wont be rushed through trying to lash out at anyone and new rules for loot will be established for future uber loot that no one wants as regular gear. We all made mistakes on this on Enantiomer step up and take the blame with the rest of us, yes you jumped fast to react after the random but man you did role the damn thing and to my knowledge 3 against one in officer chat says they both told you they wouldn’t use. @#%$ happens at raids we just do some of us have never done before and get some cool ass @#%$ hearts race…we all make mistakes…This one cost us friends unfortunately  <br>

<br>
I don't know of any guild where NBG isn't the norm. Most guilds work together to make each other stronger because you cannot achive anything in this game with one person. Your guild does not believe this to be the case.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, when this was noticed by one of your officers he was removed. He was removed for being unselfish. It was a choice of the selfish officer or the one who acted in the interest of you and you all lost out.<br>
<br>
If you don't approve of that you have two choices. You have a vote of no-confidence in your leadership and elect new leaders ( although this rarely if ever works in EQ ) or you quit. If you quit CD and post here as to why I'm sure you'll be guilded somewhere better within the month.<br>
<br>
Enantiomer. You're a good guy and a capable player and more then that you've been shown to make sacrifices for your beliefs. You won't have trouble finding a new guild and new friends who treat you better. Several of the people posting here against you wont. Thats all you can take away from this. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
Beneg, I asked Enantiomer about the removal.  He hasn't reply because he doesn't care or isn't awake yet.  He removed the thread about 3 weeks ago.  He told me that he removed the thread because Tok asked him to drop the matter.  And it was dropped, Beneg.  Despite the fact that you never apologized to him -- which was one of the conditions for allowing you back in.<br>
<br>
This means two things.  1) You had access to the Officer's forum at least three weeks ago.  2) Yes, I read the post about three weeks ago when it happened.  *shrug*  I did read the officer's forum on occassion because occassionally Tokum would post things there that were directed at me.<br>
<br>
What were you doing in there?  Curiouser and curiouser.<br>
<br>
Wdar and Truely I have nothing against except insofar as they have something against Enantiomer.<br>
<br>
Wdar:  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  P.S. Just as I finished writing this, I found out that Enan also posted to Emarr the same link as above.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Talk about making assumptions, being brash and unreasonable and flying off the handle.  &quot;He can no longer be my friend?&quot;  He didn't even do it.<br>
<br>
And <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  When he is right, you CANNOT disagree with him. It makes no difference what viewpoint you take, he cannot be swayed.

<br>
What about you man?  Did you ever reconsider after you assumed Enantiomer posted the link?  Is this suggestion that you are wrong so bad that you will take personal affront to my even bringing it up?<br>
<br>
Truely, again, I'm sorry that I even had to mention your name in this at all.  But you were one of my officers and I was supposed to be able to trust you.  I assume, as you posted, that you felt that RL is more important than EQ.  Thus you sided with your family who had already made up their minds.<br>
<br>
Beneg, I would never be in a guild with you ever again.  I now see your true character shining through.  I honestly believe that the officers couldn't consider the right course of action in this case because somehow they feel they either owe you or love you or who knows what.<br>
<br>
Beneg traded for Enantiomer is a very poor choice.  Good luck to CD'rs who remain.  I hope they make some rules for you so that this sort of thing doesn't happen again!<br>
<br>
And I'm not losing another billable day worrying about this BS.  Don't know why I feel so compelled to get involved in this other than, wow, Beneg really sucks and Redawen made an unfair choice.<br>
