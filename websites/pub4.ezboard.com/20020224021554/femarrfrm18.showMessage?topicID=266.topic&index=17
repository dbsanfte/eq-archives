A nearby community to where I live in has a strong Norse heritage. They celebrate this a lot and many signs in the community are printed in Norwegian. My community has a strong Irish heritage. I went to a school that had an Irish flag. We celebrate Irish heritage here. A city an hours drive away celebrates Oktoberfest. These are all examples of white races saying I am of X ancestory and am proud and remember my ancestors.<br>
<br>
Let me disassemble the arguments against it. <br>
Cendan says<br>
Its racism plain and simple. The pledge of allegiance represents all Americans. No where does it exclude anyone, what do you think the words &quot;one nation&quot; and &quot;indivisable&quot; mean?<br>
It excluded a lot of different religions when &quot;under God&quot; was added. The teachers stress that it is not used to advocate seperatism.<br>
<br>
Kytherion says<br>
But in my opinion if the Black Liberation Front (or whatever) wants to do this, then they can build their own damn schools and salute whatever they want. If the students find the ideals of seperatism uplifting, then the students can use their own money to preach it.<br>
It was the students who discovered it while researching kwanza. If they want to explore there past and honor those who fought for the rights they enjoy I applaud them. We teach them to honor Jefferson and Washington, do you know what they did for blacks? <br>
<br>
Gladetree says<br>
replace the word &quot;black&quot; with the word &quot;white&quot; and then just imagine how long this shit would last<br>
<br>
Replace the word black with the word Native American and less people would be complaining. We afford two standards in this country. We are eternally apologetic to the point of idiocy with Native Americans, but we still deny racism against blacks occurs to this very day. This was written by a group who fought for rights the rest of us have taken for granted. I admire the children for actually coming up with something positive from there past when all pop culture wants to show them is that blacks were slaves at one time and are pimpin' da hoes now. <br>
<br>
Poppen says<br>
Hmm..ok in a nutshell its sad..its a disgrace..and it's rediculous. This kind of action is fundamentally no different from a group of hooded white thugs walking down main street screaming white power. Sick...devisive, and smacking of a hollow struggle that no longer has a central driving force. Two hundered years ago..this would have been appropriate..but today..its a waste of time for these young black AMERICANS who should be busy bettering themselves with education rather than learning new ways to falsify a dead oppresion<br>
<br>
Two hundred years ago they would have been naked on an auction block. This is NOT ancient history. This kind of action is different. The white thugs motives are to keep the blacks down the blacks motives are to empower their youth. I look at the fact that it was brought to prominence in the school by the children as a point that they are bettering themselves. In fact I applaud the efforts of anybody able to expand history beyond the text book without changing it. <br>
<br>
Cendan further says<br>
Blacks don't deserve special treatment based on the suffering of their lineage.If you think that then should we still blame Germans for Hitler? Should Jews get special treatment too?<br>
I don't care if you are green, blue, black, red, or white. You live in America and you are American. Otherwise, move along, hope you enjoyed your visit.<br>
<br>
Do I deserve special treatment. I am part Irish and we celebrated St. Pat's day at my school. We did this because the Irish have strong roots here and it is a small community. Nobody was offended. Do you think if somebody from Britain, seeing a school with an Irish flag in the halls, who had suffered at the hands of the IRA would feel anger. Maybe, but he can fuck off. We celebrated the strengths of our culture. That was in our elementary school. I didn't even know about the IRA till several years later. A nearby town with an even smaller population has had a large influx of jews, russians and mexicans and already had strong backgrounds in Chzeckoslowhatever (can't ever remember that spelling you know where I am talking about) as well as a few other European countries. They have multicultural festivals during the summer. If we had multicultural festivals at my school it would still be Irish, this is a black school in the above example.<br>
As for giving the jews special treatment, i had an enlightening visit to the Holocaust Museum and hope I can take my kids someday to the only planned, but objected to for the same arguments as above, Underground Railroad Museum. <br>
<br>
Tell the children that what they have dug up on their ancestors past is blasphemy and evil and see how much more research they will be willing to do in the future. We are the ones taking it out of context. We view it as offensive, but read again how the children and teachers view it. Jesus fucking Christ in a country where education has become a dilemma and school violence is a national problem can we please let the children see something uplifting as just that and not be the ones to make it into an issue. In fact it says they say the pledge of allegiance as you and I know it standard anyway. <br>
<br>
You can tell them that we are one united country all you want nonetheless chances are they are going to be called nigger at some point. That is America. You can say you will never say that, but you cannot guarantee that the next person will not. In my opinion I would rather them gain racial identity through the people who helped shape their past then through some of the ways popular culture presents blacks as today. As much as I disagree with some of the teachings of Malcolm X, I would rather see a black youth reading Alex Haleys bio of him, then getting their lessons on how to deal with racial divisions from gangsta rap. <br>

<br>
Then likewise you should have no problem with white students in Georgia using federal funds to explore the glory of the Confederacy, to rewrite the pledge of allegiance, and to advocate for secession.<br>
<br>
Or with German students spending tax dollars to &quot;explore&quot; their 20th century &quot;heritage&quot;...followed shortly by a nice Heil Hitler before the rest of the student body.<br>
<br>
What's the matter, Ritta? Fair is fair.<br>
<br>
This pledge of allegiance isn't exploring a damn thing, other than the limits of my fucking patience. It's not history. It's right now.<br>
<br>
Black, white, Christian, Jewish, Moslem, red, I don't give a shit what little ethnic identity someone has or decides they have. If they want funds for a street festival of an ethnic theme, fine. That's attendance optional.<br>
<br>
Schooling isn't optional, everyone goes. So I want politics and religion kept the hell out of the classroom.They can explore it on their own time with their own money.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We teach them to honor Jefferson and Washington, do you know what they did for blacks?&quot;<br>
<br>
We also teach them to honor Carver and King. We teach them to honor these people because they contributed to our society. Because that's factual, whereas this pledge isn't factual...it's a statement of political intent.<br>
<br>
The black pledge doesn't honor anything except the desires of the majority student body to inflict political ideals on the minority. I wouldn't tolerate it from whites, I won't tolerate it from blacks.<br>
<br>
Having pride doesn't make you right. The Nazis were some proud motherfuckers, I can assure you. Ethnic pride should be encouraged so long as the ideas it supports are SOUND. When those ideas become seditious or oppressive, encouraging the pride makes it worse.<br>
<br>
Sedition and oppression should not be encouraged in the schools. End of story.<br>

Before I didn't think it should be allowed even then, but this is America after all and people have rights.  As long as a school adheres to the academic requirements of all american kids and it doesn't take money from the government I guess that it has a right to teach any extras it feels the need to.<br>
<br>
One thing doesn't change though, I view it as racist.  To be fair though, I couldn't care less about my heritage... so I wouldn't know about the motive of researching "roots."<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned the Indian Nation.  While we are on the subject I just want to say they piss me off.<br>
<br>
It is one thing to live on free land (they did own it after all) and pay no taxes.  Its another if they want money for social improvements (schools and roads), since taxes pay for those and they don't pay them.  Its another to sell tobacco and beer tax free to make profit.  Its another thing to run casinos that are illegal elsewhere to make a profit.<br>
<br>
I have respect for those who want to honor a different way of life.  Those who live in a traditional way, the "old way."  I don't respect those who use it as an excuse to make a profit. <p><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" height="1">

All of the people who commited acts of slavery are dead...long dead...sure they have decendants..but these people owe zero monetary payback to anyone becuase they are not the offenders.  My view on this was why be devisive.  Why rewrite the pledge of allegiance just to make your race feel better.  If they understood the pledge, they would understand it does already apply to them and is the best they could get...by being devisive all they accomplish is prolonging an already dead era of slavery and oppression for which there is no one to hold accountable.<br>

Ok and that was 30-40 years ago.  What is your point? The people who made decisions back then like that not the ones making decisions today. (in general)<br>
<br>
And no, there shouldn't be any racial wounds in society today.  The only reasons those wounds are still there is because people want to hold on to those wounds.  Heaven forbid they realise most people today had absolutly 0 control on what happened in the past.  Yet some choose to act as if we did.<br>

<br>
When you say blacks also didn't keep people in slavery.  My response was, neither did any white people today.  Nor did many whites &quot;beat and kill&quot; blacks anymore than blacks have done to whites in recent years.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

That's the problem, you see it as a long time as many others do.  Why does it matter how long ago? What matters is how it is today.  So just how long is &quot;long enough&quot; until it should be let go Kanibaal? 1 generation, 2..3..5?<br>
<br>
To coninue on about some black people choosing to hold onto the wounds.  Some sure do.  To be general, anytime someone uses the excuse of like &quot;my people have been opressed for hundreds of years so I deserve this&quot; to try to get something free today, that is holding on to an open wound for benefit.<br>

<br>
Kanibaal raises a very good point. The people who have been oppressed by racism simply because they are black are alive today and remember the hatred many white people showed them.<br>
<br>
A wider issue is that the US Federal Government had done little to stop racism and in particular the South. In general, I can see the perspectives of some that want the US Federal Government to compensate them for the extreme hardships they underwent.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when will this cease? Does financial compensation really reverse the sins of the past? For that matter, doesn't having a &quot;Black pledge of allegiance&quot; simply reinstate segregation... a &quot;reverse segregation&quot;?<br>
<br>
I believe that all US Citizens should be concerned when the fundamentals of the country are tampered with openly. The Pledge of Allegiance is one of those fundamentals. <br>
<br>
The Pledge of Allegiance has already been used to divide the US. In 1892 when the pledge was first formulated it simply read &quot;I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&quot; In 1954, after the Knights of Columbus lobbied heavily in congress, the pledge was changed with the addition of &quot;under God&quot;. The change was a blatant message in response to the so-called &quot;Red Scare&quot; that the US was not an atheistic communist country. However, the change also continues to be used to erode the fundamental pursuit of liberty in the US. Many athiests, such as my self, and other non-christians have been attacked for our beliefs by Christians who like to claim that the US is a &quot;Christian&quot; nation. Usually they pull out a dollar bill and point at the Pledge of Allegiance as evidence (when in fact it is not).<br>
<br>
It is best not to tamper with the Pledge of Allegiance. Sure, if some black private schools want an additional pledge to their race, then have at it. However, there is a large difference between a pledge to country and a pledge to race. One is a pledge of loyalty to all countrymen/countrywomen; the other is a racist pledge. When whites utter such a pledge (like the KKK and Neo-Nazis) they are at once denounced as scum sucking garbage. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
The flag of the United States is not red, blask, and green. If one wants to salute another flag, then fine, but to pledge allegiance to &quot;one nation of black people&quot;? What nation is that? Not the United States. And, just what is the &quot;land we must obtain&quot;? Does that mean all others that are not black are going to be rounded up by these people?<br>
<br>
The United States is a multi-ethnic country. The above &quot;black pledge&quot; seems to deny that with statements that would count as racist if you sustitute &quot;black&quot; with &quot;white&quot;. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

The mention of the flag and there homeland is because so much of this identity was stripped from them. Do you think plantation owners who took there names from them allowed them to keep memoirs from there past? No. So, in the sixties there was a big search for identity amongst the blacks. They went to the trouble of rediscovering there roots and by rewriting the pledge they are showing there youths there is another part of America. A part not decended from the Union Jack. I don't think it means they are going to force whitey out i think it means they are going to obtain America like they weren't previously allowed to. They began to vote, to open businesses, and to own property. That is how are ancestors obtained America. Well that and genocide. <br>
<br>
I do not need a pledge because my ancestors were allowed to fly there flag from the day they got here. They were allowed to cook there foods, teach there songs, myths and legends. They were allowed to pass there names onto there heirs. I am not an apologist, but i figure allowing them some concessions they have been stripped of is not that big of a deal. You want to deal with racism in schools find out why New York is dropping cops in schools that have an unremarkable violence rate, becuase the students there are at &quot;risk&quot; (read minority). White people don't want there schools looking like prisons so they don't. You know what the end result of uniformed police in a school is: higher drop out rate. Turns out cops aren't trained to deal with kids and kids don't feel like being in a jail like environment when they don't have to.<br>
