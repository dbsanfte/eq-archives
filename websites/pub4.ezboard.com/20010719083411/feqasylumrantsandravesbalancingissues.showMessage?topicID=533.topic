<br>
So naturally we need something new to waste ezboards memory. Because of abortions highly debated status, it would be stupid to move to something which noone has an opinion on, thus we'll move to something which seems to be very well "studied" and "documented" by personal at this board.<br>
<br>
Now you ask why censorship AND drugs, what on earth do they have to do with each other. Well both are some of the governments "primary" concerns regarding protecting children. School funding in half the country is lower then money spent on presidential campaigns, yet drugs sex and violence are what we wanna protect our children from, even though these things more popular in school then the actual schooling. Anyone who's been through the public school system in america knows this.<br>
<br>
So lets start with drugs and my views, since i'm sure they'll have as much impact on the rest of the thread as they did in the abortion thread, ha ha. <br>
<br>
Drugs are a recreational activity with addictive qualities. The government for some reason considers use of these substances illegal and has imprisioned more drug users then actual criminals in the last 10 years. Penalties are in line with burglary for growing, and murder / rape for dealing. Nothing special here, this is common knowledge, just standard introduction spiel.<br>
<br>
Reasons for illegalization are sketchy usually, but usually are in line with health care, and the addictive burden it can put on people. While both can go for alcohol and cig's, its usually discarded. Both bring it great revenue for the government through special taxes applied to both. <br>
<br>
Now you wonder, marajuana, pot, dope, grass, whatever you call it, a somewhat harmless plant much like tobacco, is probably the most used drug in the world if you don't count alcohol and cig's, could lead to that same revenue but in much higher amounts. Legalize dope and stick a heavy tax on it, free up prison space, reduce crime, insure unspiked product. Many good things could happen, the reason it hasn't? Well a typical response to a question like that is, its a gateway drug. It does have harmful effects if used in excess or at a young age, and a bunch of other things that alcohol and cig's are responsible for anyway. <br>
<br>
Now i'm not saying that it is harmless, I know many a stoners and those that do it way too much and at a way to early age are to put it nice, morons. So put a 21 age limit on it, sure teens will get it, who cares, they get it now anyway.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is just one drug of many. Most have harmful effects,  the question is, who cares. Legalize them, let people kill themselves if they want to. Why do tax payers have to waste money on prisons to house these people hell bent on destruction. Thanks, thats all I have to say about that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Right on to censorship, the main idea behind this is to protect our children. Well protect them from what? This is really just a stupid idea brought on the government by religous groups that think its sin. I really don't know any kid that doesn't know as many 4 letter words as me, so the FCC or whoever polices the radio and tv are not really doing anything that seems to be working. Same goes for sexual content. Hell it should be mandatory that a guy see's some sort of porn before 14. This of course to avoid him from making some big mistakes in his future. Maybe theres not much to talk about for this part of the rant, mainly due to everyones view of it as stupid, but hey, no one talked about religion in the other threat so who cares. <br>
<br>

So, personally I really couldn't share any first hand experiences.....except for all the friends that I knew in highschool that were drug users. I grew up in Germany, and Amsterdam wasn't that far away and it was easy to get to by train...take a bunch of American kids who would rather be in the states, an excellent public transportation system, lots of extra spending cash, parents who are too busy to track them down, and easily available legal drugs and you have 16yr olds who disappear for two weeks and have no idea where they have been, what they have done and how they got home.  Luckily most caught diseases that were treatable, no one to my knowledge died but at least five or ten kids from my graduating class (of 100) were in and out of rehab.<br>
<br>
As for censorship?  The idea of &quot;childhood&quot; is a relatively new concept...maybe a 100 years old?  It only developed when more and more people had expendable income and could afford to let their children be children.  Prior to that, you were just a short adult who didn't get paid as much.  Think about what children saw in the mills and factories during the industrial revolution and shortly after it, what they saw on farms, and in bars and others places they went to meet their parents.  <br>
<br>
I was raised in an incredibly &quot;open&quot; environment, no questions were ever dealt with vague answers, I got infomative lectures on everything...nothing was spared.  And I don't belive it hurt me that much probably because the information was imparted to me in an responsible manner.  Only rarely did I wish my parents would just say &quot;No,&quot; but that's when I had a difficult decision to make, and they would tell me I had all the tools to make the right decision, and that they would offer advice adn let me know what they expected me to do, but I still had to be the one who decided and followed through.<br>
<br>
  I rode the bus to kindergarted my first day of school and I learned to swear in a few different languages...when I brought home my wonderful new words, my parents sat down and explained exactly what they meant and when and where they were appropriate and how I would be treated if I did misuse them.  <br>
<br>
I grew up on a military base; there was one book store and they carried pornography (nothing to incredibly hardcore I'm sure, but playboy, hustler and the like).  The magazines were kept on a rack in full veiw of every one, their packages were designed so you could only see the title and I assume you had to be a certain age to purchase them.  I always knew they were there, and I knew what was in them even if I had never seen one up close.  And thanks to my parents,   I was never in the dark about what was okay and what was not okay.<br>
<br>
My point?  If parents talk to their children and nurture them, there is no need for censorship.  Isn't it after all the parents' job to raise their children as they see fit?  If they don't want them to use certain words or see certain things then it's their job to make sure their children don't...and if they do it's their job to repair any &quot;damage&quot; they think may have occured.  I am not saying we should live in a free-for-all world, where anything and everything is allowed, but when is it the government's job to decide what is appropriate for me to read and not read?  Or further more, do they have the right to tell me what is and is not appropriate for my children to see and hear?  <br>
<br>
I suppose both issues relate to responsibility...who's responsibility is it?  Are we asking the government to take the place of responsible parents?  Are we asking congress to take the place of a caring community that keeps an eye on everyone's children?  And, as an adult, if I do become hooked on an addictive substance...who's fault is that?  Should the government then be responsible for my care and rehab, because I knew better and did it anyway?<br>

As for censorship I once heard a Jewish activist quoted as saying "Neo-Nazi groups should not be banned, if you ban them they go underground.  When they are free to voice thier opinions, you can follow thier movements and developements."   Well, thats not an exact quote, but its the message.  All things that are banned develope an underground unregulated market, filled to the gills with crime. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umegillagerilla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Megilla Gerilla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/17/01 6:51:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion is done, Censorship and Drugs turn!</span><hr size=1> government would make more money off marijuana if it was legalized, I really don't see why they dont do it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spirithowl</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/17/01 8:09:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dreamingwolficon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion is done, Censorship and Drugs turn!</span><hr size=1> Back in the 30's the only company that defended marijuana was a birdseed company, I cant remember the industries that supported banning it.<br>
<br>
Legalized drugs can have several bad social repercussions, some of which you can see readily in addicts across the nation.  Legalized drugs can have the appearance of acceptance, and promote use.  As in the case of alcohol and cigarettes, both smoking and drinking are things I enjoy.  Being a trapped smoker, I can imagine that there would be many people who would try say heroine that normally wouldnt cause of its legality and its presence in the open market.<br>
<br>
I am all about personall freedoms, and that people should be able to make decisions on thier own.  However, I dont ignore that people are stupid and make poor decisions.  When deciding on major social change you must always the social cost against the revenue.  Will the heronine clinics be worth the revenue, will the influx of people that need rehabilitation be worth the revenue<br>

The guy selling weed is already underground, so he doesn't care what age he sells to. The guy selling beer has something to lose by violating the regs, so he sticks to the regs more. Not saying people under 21 who aren't the President's daughter can't get beer in this country, but there are repercussions to it at least.<br>
<br>
IMO ... Most drugs of abuse should be available for free to those who self-identify as addicts to those drugs. These drugs would be given out in limited amounts (amount needed to keep one person high each day) to those who identified as addicts. <br>
<br>
Addicts would NOT be able to hold some types of jobs. They would NOT be eligible for driver's licenses, (depending on your point of view) might sacrifice their right to vote, and they would also receive no subsidized health care for any disease they got from being an addict.<br>
<br>
Long-term gains to society -- children immediately cease viewing drugs as glamorous and start viewing them as ghetto. Drugs are no longer even a market ... so no *black* market. Those who value the drug more than anything else, have all the access they need, so don't have to steal, lie, cheat etc. And cops could go back to being cops. Jails would empty out ... We'd save more than enough money in law enforcement and prison space to cover the cost of the drugs.<br>
<br>

It's odd though. We fear drugs because it's evil and will lead to crime and other social disorders... Yet the countries that have legalized specific drugs have a much lower drug related crime rate. <br>
<br>
Drugs are expensive.. Therefore people steal to get drugs.<br>
<br>
Legalized drugs are cheap and plentifull. Like cigs they are cheap enough most people that want them can afford them.<br>
<br>
As for Censorship.. This country is pathetic. It claims that we don't censor yet their are committees and boards that do just that. You can't put this in a movie, you can't do that in a movie. You have to put this warning here. But we won't censor you as long you only do that in a specific place and put all kinds of warning and red tape in front of it.<br>

<br>
The economic damage that Hemp (low-THC content version of cannibus) would do to the Oil &  gas industries, cotton, paper, and tobacco industries.<br>
<br>
Thats right. It's all about money. The use of hemp and the various (multitudinous) products that can be processed from it directly challenges the 'Big Four' industries that have been in play in the US since before the formation of the union (excluding Oild & Gas, which came later but still hold the same power).<br>
<br>
Imagine, a single plant that could produce products of similar or superior quality while being less harmful to the environment. Such thoughts are Revolutionary and Subversive!<br>
<br>
Not really, but the republicans and bought democrats think so.<br>
<br>
In fact, Marijuana is illegal because it's legalization would also legalize the legalized growing of Hemp (as it's low-THC content could not be banned if the higher intoxicating strains were legalized).<br>
<br>
Plus, the fact that hemp can be grown almost anywhere would reduce the south's stranglehold on the cotton market, such as it may cause a greater crash in the economy because of reflexive responses. <br>
<br>
Now, I ask you, what other reason would their be for keeping a plant that would eradicate the massive deforestation of our northern lands and mountainous areas, or that would create a fiber stronger than cotton, rendering it's value much lower on the open market because of viable substitutes, or a plant that can produce oil's that can be used in energy production processes that not only are easily obtainable (as easy as growing wheat or corn!), but renewable as well (which oil is not).<br>
<br>
The continuing push for the government to 'Open the topic to further study', even though it has been throughly studied for over 100 years, is as obvious as it is transparent. <br>
<br>
Consider the fact that Legalized marijuana could also cause irreprable harm to the Alchohol and Tobacco industries while, as has been proven, causing less debilitating and long term harmful effects than the other two, and you have your reasons for the continued fight to keep marijuana and other plants of it's type illegal.<br>
<br>
Such is the sad world of Pork Barrel Politics that you can't enjoy a good healthy, enviromentally safe buzz, but are free to enjoy sucking up chemical laden carcinogen delivery devices and bio-logical by products that great inhibit your ability to reason.<br>

Although there is a big difference between &quot;hemp&quot; and pot you would smoke (industrial hemp has basically no THC) there is a huge debate going on over whether or not growing it in the US should be legalized.  It's uses are extremely wide spread and there is no doubt that its introduction would cause great harm to many industries (Oil, Lumber, Cotton, basically all the things he already listed.  In fact the only limiting factor on it's use right now are the tariffs placed on its importation (its legal to grow it and is a major cash crop in Canada and much of Europe, France in particular, and it is legal to import it), thus relegating it to use in expensive premium products such as expensive clothing and top-grade stationary/paper products.  <br>
<br>
Even if you just look at the environmental impact it could have within the paper industry alone is staggering.  For starters far more paper can be produced per acre then could ever come from timber, and thats just for a single harvest.  While the trees take decades to grow, hemp can be harvested 3 times a year in the right climate.  Hemp fibers are also stronger then wood and produce a higher quality paper (hence their current use over wood in premium products).<br>
<br>
As for the oil, theres little argument it could provide a clean, renewable, and efficient alternative to fossil fuels were the money ever invested in the infrastructure to support it.  The problem?  The hemp industry is an emerging market with neither the established business base nor the money to support the full time lobbyists the industries it would compete with can and do throw at the government daily.  As Korrso said, these major industries are big time fund contributors as well as the employers to large numbers of constituents so theres little political capital to be gained by doing anything that might hurt them.<br>
<br>
The arguments against it?  Drugs.  The constant thing you hear from the politicians is that they want to keep it illegal because it would let people hide &quot;dope&quot; crops among legitimate industrial hemp fields.  Anyone with any knowledge of basic botany can tell you this is nuts since the industrial and THC-full crops would cross pollenate like crazy ruining both.  Yet they keep spitting this excuse out over and over.  If pot were legalized, their argument would become moot and it'd be tough to find another reason not to let it in.  Industry controlling the government = no legal pot for j00!<br>
<br>
edit: as for the birdseed companies being the only thing to defend it, I think your info may be a bit off here because hemp was a pretty big crop in the textiles industry.  Also, hemp seed oil as an large scale energy source has become a viable option only due to fairly recent (last decade or so) technological developements so that basis for its defence didn't even exist at the time of its illegalization.  Not to mention that environmental concerns weren't even on the radar yet so why would they really want to grow fields of it and harvest it when they could just chop down trees and drill oil that was already there? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/3dlgowu2.jpg BORDER=0> at: 6/19/01 5:16:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udreamingwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreamingwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spirithowl</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/19/01 6:37:44 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dreamingwolficon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion is done, Censorship and Drugs turn!</span><hr size=1> I wasnt saying that the birdseed company was the only company that used hemp products, just the only company that stood up in hemps defense.

<br>
The Duke of Nuke's post was very well written and I have to agree with his statements.<br>
<br>
I just wonder if we'll ever see one earth shattering all encompassing topic/event that finally wakes the huddled masses from their biggie sized televised coma, that they may grasp the fact that politicians accepting ANY money from a company or individual should be illegal.  No questions asked.  No speaking fees, no free lunches, no campaign pledges, nothing.  I'm sorry, I may be wrong in my viewpoint here, but I think it's about time influence buying comes to an end.  That might be a good starting point for change...<br>
<br>
and yeah, censorship in a &quot;free&quot; country bites rat ass<br>
<br>
marijuana legalization = good<br>
&quot;hard&quot; (cocaine, heroin, meth, etc) drug legalization = bad<br>
&quot;hard&quot; drug treatment programs = good<br>
<br>
No, I don't have the answers to how treatment programs would be implemented or administered yet, so don't ask me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrambler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brambler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/3dlgowu2.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/20/01 3:11:45 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://eqbrambler.homestead.com/files/leaf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Abortion is done, Censorship and Drugs turn!</span><hr size=1> Only problem is getting the politicians to vote yes on cutting off their own campaign funds. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
