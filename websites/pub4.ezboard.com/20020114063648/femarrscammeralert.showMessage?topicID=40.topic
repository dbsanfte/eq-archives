<br>
He did in fact leave EQ...He lived a few doors down from me, then he moved cross country...he was RL friends with my little brother (Casto). He was in fact hacked...by an ex PC...who at one point was tealunns friend...that is what I was told by my brother. He was absent from EQ for so long because he was moving. <br>
<br>
Okay...just a note don't come on here and ruin...or try to ruin someones reputation...especially when you don't KNOW the FACTS..Wodaman! I think it is fairly stupid also that you booted him cause of that...Do you have a guild policy that says we don't tell stories...or we BOOT YOU? He was your guildmate for christs sake. show a little more respect to him, do you treat all your members like that? Okay I will stop...I just think you should post an apology on here saying that what you did was compulsive and rash.<br>

<br>
Put yourself at our place. You have a member of your guild trying to scam people inside the guild. What will you do? For the sake of the guild and the honor of his name, you kick him out and warn people about his behaviour.<br>
<br>
Now, if what you say is true, this is even worse. Tealun account have been hacked? And by a member of PC?? Give us his name. Hacker should be banned, even if they are friends. Deguilding Tealun was the right thing to do in both case. If the right owner of the account can come back and tell us things that only him can know, no problem at all, we will reguild him and help him to get his stuff back. But sof the moment, the person who has hacked Tealun's account stay out of the guild and in the mind of everyone a scammer.<br>
<br>
I will be the first to come here to make an apology and to reinstall Tealun in the mind of EM player when he can come back and prove us he was hacked. <p>Nosfy Vifargent <BR>The Lil'yoddling Paladin <BR>

Not to mention he is my brother and I know what he does. Now just because all mighty chukzombi says he found by some source he doesn't want to say that casto was playing tealunn I quote &quot;grubbing&quot; doesn't mean shit. As I said before Neither my brother nor I know tealunns account info. And that statement at the bottom chuk was un needed...let us announce that we quit your guild...trying to put that on here to maybe take a cheap shot at our rep is lame.

I knew that Tealunn had moved across country.  But here is what happened when we decided he needed removed.<br>
<br>
Tealunn logs in and says all my gear was stolen and could we help him to get it back.  A lot of us are feeling bad for him and offer to help him get his gear back.  At this time Shenmerlan gives me a tell saying to not believe Tealunn.  I am like why.  Shen informs me that he gave Tealunn a lift not 20 mins earlier and had all his crafted armor and his yaks.  At this time I have Shen give Tealunn a tell and ask him something that only him and Tealunn would know.  Shenmerlan hates lower guk and only went there one time and left not long after this.  Shen asked him how he liked all those times that they grouped together in LGUK.  Now what does this tell me.  One, that this is not the original Tealunn.  Two, that he was armored not 20 mins earlier and now all of a sudden he is naked.  Now here is the kicker for you Dalthar.  After about an hour, he says over guildspeak, that someone just walked up and gave him all of his gear back without question.  We promptly remove him without hesitation.  This was of course a scam and will not be tolerated by anyone in my guild.  We help each other get gear all the time but we will not be taken advantage of.<br>
<br>
Dalthar if you want to slam my guild for not being there for him, get your facts straight.  The original Tealunn was a great kid.  Don't come on here and try to defend him when you have no clue as to what is going on.  If you have any questions regarding this, feel free to give me a tell in game and we can hash this out.<br>

The next day I was on and I got a tell from him asking for some money so he could buy stuff (he was on as a caster in an oracle robe)- I said you have a full set of crafted with 2 yaks (on Tealunn) and an oracle robe on this guy - why dont you sell some of your stuff? - and he said he didn't want to sell it and could he please have some money to buy stuff... He then asked what equipment Purifyre had and I told him SMR etc etc - then he insisted about 8 times in a row that I log on as Purifyre - which I refused - he then asked me to give him my SMR (he made it out to be a joke but it was obvious he really wanted it) - his begging for equipment and money really annoyed me to say the least - I never met the original Tealunn but I can't imagine Phoenix Crusaders would ever have someone like that in the guild (the person playing him now I mean).

It is not for everyone to know who i think it is so i will not say. When i first got back, I had no clue this all happened, and then i got EQ to work on my computer and when i logged on i wasnt in PC anymore. I talked to Togam, an elder for Pc and we sent each other emails. He asked me questions about things we did together that only we would know, and i asnwered them just like he knew them. He said he was going to talk to all of you or whatever, and nothing ever happened. If you guys have any questions for me, just email me at jpbiker@aol.com or post here, i will be reading this now that i know of it.<br>

<br>
What did I tell you to do the day you told me you'd been hacked?  <p><HTML><CENTER>

That problem is that I(the real tealunn) did not hear this question from you, because it was the person that was on my account. Ask a question to me that i would know from before i moved. <br>
<br>
Woda, I know stuff that only you and me would know, as well as most other PC's i did stuff with. Just email me, and i can prove to you that this is the real Tealunn. My email is JPBiker052@aol.com . I am also playing now, only on weekends tho, so you can talk to me then.<br>

The hacker, hacks the account, takes all the gear, tells the guild he has been hacked, talks to me for 1/2 an hour and then (and this is why I asked the question) almost 4 weeks later talks to me about our previous conversation?<br>
<br>
During which time the Tealunn who is the hacker goes round asking people for gear when hes wearing full crafted and thousands of PP worth of gear, generally making an ass of himself.<br>
<br>
Tealunn, I can only think the worst here. Either the hacker played on your account for a month on a daily basis (which is a really stupid thing to do) during which time you dont hear any of the reputation your character was getting.<br>
<br>
You got hacked twice by the same guy.<br>
<br>
You never got hacked.<br>
<br>
Or something entirely different went on. <br>
<br>
Then you got all your gear back and some extra stuff judging by what youve been seen in lately.<br>
<br>
Tealunn. If you were hacked Im really sorry mate. Its unfortunate but you have your gear back so we werent abandoning you. But looking at the events the way most of the PC tell it can you blame us for being suspicious? My point is this. You can tell Woda things that only the real Tealunn would know but you cant prove that it wasnt you when Tealunn was begging for stuff. Theres very little way of doing that. <p><HTML><CENTER>
