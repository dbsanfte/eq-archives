Lawrence Poe  on Graffes Message board<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to sit down and write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple quick notes. <br>
<br>
The &quot;problem&quot; with rain spell pulses always being resisted if they will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an intentional design feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse poof buf. If the Rain killed the NPC and the server was unsure where the damage came from the corpse would poof, so these spells were coded in this manner to prevent that from happening. I'm working with the coders to come up with a better solution. We're all pretty busy right now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when a better solution will be implemented.<br>
<br>
Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't have to be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both Wizards and Druids evac spells. <br>
<br>
Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense for the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have the self version work indoors. <br>
<br>
Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells on test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose slam, sorry for the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way to give SKs skeleton form.<br>
<br>
Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're working on some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. More stacking issues should be resolved in the coming months. High level players should be pleased to know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will no longer conflict after the next patch. <br>
<br>
New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells up on test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you can expect that cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again. <br>
<br>
Now on to the &quot;Burning issue&quot;. I know the Wizard community has been *patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal testing. It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have seen it in a parser – cause I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is group utility. <br>
<br>
As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels where they seem to be struggling for usefulness. <br>
<br>
The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some people but the need for multiple wizards to &quot;Anchor&quot; an NPC won't really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers. For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells implemented and ready to go before the next patch. <br>
<br>
Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who have reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over the past couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Take care all!<br>

Now being honest - other than western wastes in dragon raids  - how many of you really have had problems in groups with monsters gating from you ? Is this a major problem that will ensure Wizards being picked for a group if it came down to either a druids pet or a wizard for that one final group slot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (jk-- dont flame- inside joke) <p><br>

I can't trust my computers lag for soloing so grouping is the only safe way I feel, for me to level, well I could camp Cyndreela but come on people... she's dick exp at 54 and a 6 minute spawn, after taking 12 seconds to kill her.. that's over 5 minutes to sit and ponder fate.. that gets fookin boring.<br>
<br>
So this new spell is resistable per upgrade huh? I'm guessing one's at 51, highly resistable and chance of mob gating it lessened by 10 percent, 55, mob's chance of gating lessened by 25 percent, and half of the time resisted, 60 is unresistable and 40 percent chance lessened, remember, this spell doesn't make a mob NOT gate, it only lessens the chance that the will, reason why multiple wizards have to cast it, you know, people kill shit in DN all the time without this spell, I see this peice of crap just being a nice addition for security, sort of like how wizards are used for snares.<br>
<br>
I see groups having to do CR's in OS all the damn time, why? Cause no one evac'd when they saw ten mobs coming at them. Why no evac? Cause the fookers never picked up a wizard or dr00d. And don't hand me that bullshit that the evac'er didn't have time to evac, cause you'd have to be the dumbest peice of crap group in the world to die in less than 6 seconds in OS, with healers, tanks, and enchies. However there is the odd occurance when the mobs all gang up on the evac'er and he dies pretty damn quick, and that's pretty much the only exception to the rule. <br>
<br>
Why don't people pick up evacer's? Cause they won't need them. Cause they don't plan on dying, and if they do then damn, oh well, a CR is always fun.<br>
<br>
What's this spell done that helps wizards? It's given us a place on uber raids. oh boy, we have a use on raids now, great, more exp to slowly lose. Hell, I love raids, I'm a raid kinda guy, but hell, I don't only want to raid...<br>
<br>
And people CAN survive without having a wizard to cast this spell you know.. if there is truly an uber mob, like that named chetari in DN that gates and gets everyone killed, do you think a lvl 51 spell is gonna get me on that raid? That's like me using a level 8 nuke on a 100 k hitpoint mob cause it's weak to that spell.<br>
<br>
I thought this &quot;ehancement&quot; would actually be gayer, but it seems that it is only slightly better, cause it gives me an excuse to give raid leaders when I wanna do DN!!<br>
<br>
uber_d00d_00 tells you,' no, we don't need a snarer, go away'<br>
You say,' but I can evac!'<br>
uber_d00d_00 tells you,' evac in a raid? Are you insane, go home!'<br>
You say,' I can cast unresistable DD's!!'<br>
uber_d00d_00 tells you,' You mean sometimes unresistble, I seen you  try to fight Vindi and he resisted every lure you hit him with,'<br>
You say,' ok, take this one. I.. can sometimes make mobs not gate!'<br>
An uber_d00d_00 shivers with the thought of messing with you.<br>
uber_d00d_00 tells you,' Okay, you're on the raid bud! We have only one mob that gates, he'll prolly resist you, he'll prolly gate ven if that spell sticks, but what the hell!!

<br>
Do you play a wizard? If so are you in an uber guild?<br>
<br>
If the answer to the first question is no, then you obviously haven't sat down during whole fights just to med up, cast snare, sit down med up cast a nuke every few mins. You know, I have been in groups where I cast snare and no one seems to notice? Fun fun!<br>
<br>
If the answer to the first question is yes and so is question two, then you probably don't have to worry about groups because you have guildies to get you those groups, congratulations on being with the top ten percent of wizards.<br>

If the answer to the first question is yes and the other is no, then are you on crack bro? Seriously, I think we need to get you help..<br>

<br>
Until we see the effectiveness of the spell, it's hard to say what it's worth, but lets say best case scenario, and it works pretty damn well.  <br>
<br>
Gating mobs... sebillis comes to mind a lot, I bet quite a few folks have seen that froglock wiz gate in chef, and realized it's a race between you camping, and getting summoned and doing a CR.  <br>
<br>
Dragon necropolis, those rats love to gate, and doing a CR is a pain in the arse.  <br>
<br>
ToV, can think of some definite uses there, saves my ass from mana draining ceruleans and glimmers *YaY!*<br>
<br>
There are lots of different zones where this is a nice boost.  It's not the overpowering change that you were maybe hoping for, but it's still a nice upgrade.  Hell, it makes me wonder if I'll ever need to sieve again (yeah right, but I can wish).  <br>

WOO!<br>
<br>
I believe Kerrol was referring to the fact that Hoshkar is one of the hardest mobs to kill in VP (and therefore Kunark) because of his propensity to gate. He's the major hurdle between a guild being VP-capable and being able to clear VP. I can't think of a single person I've talked to about Hoshkar that didn't have horror stories about his gating. The &quot;thank your lucky fucking stars&quot; is probably directed at the guilds yet to kill Hoshkar, and not the wizards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And if that's all you do as a wiz <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've always found what you put in is what you get.. you need to look for ways to excel and put some effort into pushing the envelope of your class abilities, or you're taking a lot away from your gaming experience, through no one's fault but your own. One of the best memories I have is when I was level 50 and I got dared to try to kill the froglok yun priest inside the live tower in LGuk, solo, with the tower at full pop. I remember asking Aatelin for help (OMG, 50 necro, POWERFUL!) and getting told no because he thought it was suicide. Three deaths later, I had my own pair of silver plated leggings and an experience I can still remember over a year later. <p><FONT COLOR=purple>~<b><i>Khael Incantare</i></b></FONT><br><FONT COLOR=silver><i>Proud Officer of Affliction</i></FONT></b></FONT><br><FONT COLOR=silver><i>Sorcerer of Erollisi Marr</i></FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sagemon>Sagemon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 6:09:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ode To Joy-- wizards future class defining group enhancment</span><hr size=1> I'm sure all the wizards wanted something cooler than an anti-Gate spell.  That's just human nature.  Every class wants some cool addition to make it a lot more powerful.<br>
<br>
Verant thinks that wizards are balanced.  A lot of wizards would disagree with that, and they may be right.<br>

Let's set all of that aside and take a look at the anti-Gate spell without all of the other baggage.  Folks, this is a very useful spell for a group in a lot of places, including OS and Chardok.  Anyone who has had a gate-summon-death wipeout in one of those dungeons can tell you that.  Even when I'm firing off clerical stuns, and the enchanter is firing off color stuns, and the tanks are bashing away, a mob occasionally manages to gate.  If the enchanter is dealing with adds, and I'm healing near-dead tanks, gate spells are a real danger.<br>
<br>
This spell is going to make wizards more desirable for groups.  When this spell is added, wizards will be the most upgraded class in the game (the TL changes have already made wizards more popular).  Good for Verant!  Wizards needed upgrades more than any other class in the game, with the possible exception of paladins. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufitzroygreymalkin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fitzroy Greymalkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 6:45:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ode To Joy-- wizards future class defining group enhancment</span><hr size=1>       Anti gating spells are akin to spell interupts and stun .... we all have on ocassion of mobs CHing themselves or others .... comes down to the caster burning or chain casting stuns so the mob doesn't get a chance to accomplish it ... imho anti gating spells are just another lame excuse on Verant's part to placate us ....<br>

3) DL is evil.  And a waste of Batwings.<br>
<br>
As for the anti gate spell..ummm.....huh?  I'd like some sort of AoE concussion. (or a spell called Form of the Drake, just so wizards can turn into something :P )  An Ice dmg shield that stacks with O'kiels would be neat too, especially for the added CR, but that's just dreaming on my part. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sure, you weren't as bad as people made you out to be, but the simple fact was, in a game built around sociablity, you need something that makes you &quot;needed&quot; which you never had.<br>
<br>
So you get an Anti-gate spell. You know just how many oh my god CR's this is gonna fix? Gating mobs is one of the most ANNOYING things in the damn game. As for it's place, I dunno if they should implement it or not, makes the game easier imo, but I guess to each his own.<br>
<br>
But, even though you get something that will make you astoundingly more important for uber mobs, you still bitch. The simple fact is, that you want something that will make you the cream of the crop. It's simple really, you played a wizard, of course you're going to be power hungry. You have a good dmg/time ratio, you have the ability to travel the world abound, you can stun, and you can stop gaters. What do you want? I understand and sympathize, partially however. It doesn't matter how good you are, as long as the rest of the populace doesn't feel you're needed. My main being a ranger, I can understand all too well, that a classes actual ability is not in his strength, but in the eye of his peers. <br>
<br>
Personally, I think Verant should give you guys higher nukes. With mobs by FAR exceeding the hitpoint marker of the old world, it seems atroscious to increase your dmg output by merely 400 points. I think you guys should have a spell you can cast 3-4 times that hits for a nice 7-10k dmg, that would at least stay in tune with old world logic.<br>
<br>
It's a fine line between balanced and overpowered, and all I've seen is bitching, and not advice. Feel free to tell me how I'm wrong, if I am though.<br>

<br>
As for the new TL's, I pray to god they require a component, why? Have you ever rellied on porting people around some days to make cash? Halk my business got stripped when TL's came out, I just think it seems wrong for someone to pay me, to use only half of a portal mana, and not even zone. I get tells all the time for TL's in OS. And I tell em I'm in *put camp name here* if you can get here without training us, then I'll port you. Sure, I like not having to zone, but the thing that bites is that carrying money around for portals, is going bye bye. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uxastlingloveburner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xastlin Gloveburner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 9:29:46 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.cet.com/~ostliek/xastlin.jpg WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=130></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ode To Joy-- wizards future class defining group enhancment</span><hr size=1> Dont think there bitching per say- but when it was discussed , and the thousands of posts that were brought up with ways to improve the wizard class. I dont remember many anti gating spells being tossed out. I think in a guild raid or epic mob cleaning these spells will rock. But in your everyday group look for exp days. Not much help. If they fix the rain spells   and make it less resistable that in itself will make alot of wizards jump for joy.<br>
<br>
 The other thing that is a big bone for wizards-- WE WILL NEVER AGAIN have to go to KANORS (unless its to jump some guilds rotation) and ever have to deal with someones train at the entrance for EJ trips (Ode to JOY being played in the background with the thousands of druids, and wizards who will never have to  step foot in KC ever again)<br>

Anti- gating not much to say untill I see it work-- would be perfect for the chumps who just win the random NBG, and decide whooo got homework I have to do because Im failing 3 of my 8 classes, thanks for the group bye---- Wizard casts anti-gate so now they have to walk out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In fact, if this spell works with any reliability, it could make some epic encounters much easier than they were intended to be. <br>
<br>
Nobody has even mentioned it yet, but how much mana this spell costs is really the determining factor in how useful it is in a group setting.  Being a wizard in a group is all about controlling your mana pool and not overextending yourself so you have to med out fights.  As long as this spell doesn't overtax the mana pool, it should be at least some help. <br>

These percentages are based on the old world 32K mobs and the IC doing 3.59% of their hps. This way if a wiz were fighting the dino in OOT for example, they would be no better off than using IC but if they were in Velious fighting a 100K mob, they could do 3500 damage at 60, which is an equivelent contribution, and enshrines them as Masters of DD. <p>Ziktiny Totenstille<br>

One of the better strengths of the paladin class is their ability to stop spell casting easily.  We get bash and up to three stun spells, which if you chain cast can either stop just about every spell a mob is going to cast and/or keep it completely immobile for everyone to beat upon freely.  Sure enchanters and clerics possess these same spells but usually they have better things to do with their mana.  If you have no clue what i'm talking about then you probably have never grouped with a well played paladin before.  Now more recently Velious has been released and the majority of mobs on this continent are either stun proof or highly magic resistant, thus effectively removing one of the paladin's better strengths.  So what did we ask for in our balance thread you ask? You got it, an ability to be able to block spell casting on mobs which cannot be interrupted.  The biggest you pain in the asses you can imagine are mobs which CH and you cannot do anything about it and mobs which gate and you cannot do anything about it.  Sieve(enchanter only, paladins sol) is certainly the largest step towards correcting this but that still won't always block a mob gating away and causing all sorts of nastiness.  Wizards have just been tossed a very big bone and I think they should be fairly happy.  I'm still waiting for a bone bigger than a 200hp buff.  Once again if you are wondering what the hell I'm talking about then you should if you can start playing more high end game stuff on Velious and a few other spots.  Also from the way I interpret the sentence about getting 3 spells working with different resistances I think that either means the higher spells have improved success rates or hopefully means they will check against difference resistances(fire, or disease instead of magic).<br>
