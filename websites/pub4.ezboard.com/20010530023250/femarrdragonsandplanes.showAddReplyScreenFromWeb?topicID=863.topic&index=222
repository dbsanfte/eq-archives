<br>
That was great!  Tweety, I know how ya feel man!  I am a customer service rep myself, and I did tech/help desk support, and I can't tell you HOW many times I've wanted to say "I'm sorry sir/ma'am, please pack your computer up and send it back with a note telling the company that you are too friggin STUPID to own a computer!"<br>
<br>
Then you have the true idiots:<br>
<br>
Hello, technical support, how may I assist you? <br>
<br>
Your software has done something really weird to my computer! <br>
<br>
May I ask what that is sir? <br>
<br>
Well, every time I try to use it to dial out with my modem I hear the computer speaking at me and well I am starting to worry about my sanity? <br>
<br>
Well sir - do you hear the modem actually dial? <br>
<br>
Oh yes but then there is this muffled female voice <br>
<br>
And what does this voice say to you sir? <br>
<br>
"The number you have dialed is not in service,please hang up and try your call again" <br>
<br>
Let's not forget:<br>
<br>
This was related to me as an actual tale and the tech guy, working for a sizeable firm, was actually fired from his job after the call was listened to by whoever monitors those calls for quality control.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, tech support? I Just got this (model) a week or so ago, and was working tonight and now I can't see the cursor on the screen any more. One minute it was there, and the next minute it was gone.<br>
<br>
Okay, sir. Is your work still onscreen?<br>
<br>
No. that went away too.<br>
<br>
You need to check to see if the cable from the monitor is still plugged securely into the computer.<br>
<br>
(at this point, the tech can hear the caller scoot the chair back and grunt a little as he gets under or behind his desk.)<br>
<br>
It's so hard to see here. I can't tell cause it's so dark.<br>
<br>
Can you turn on another light?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
You can't?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Can you swivel the computer around so you can see the cables in the rear?<br>
<br>
Yeah, but it won't make a difference. I still won't be able to see them.<br>
<br>
Why is that, Sir?<br>
<br>
Cause the lights are all out.<br>
<br>
Can you turn them on?<br>
<br>
No. I told you that.<br>
<br>
Why won't the lights go on?<br>
<br>
Cause the power went out 10 or 15 minutes ago.<br>
<br>
(Lights come on and the tech realizes no one's home.)<br>
<br>
Okay sir, I think i know what's wrong. Do you still have the original boxes that the computer came in?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Well, you need to pack the computer back up and return it to the dealer where you purchased it.<br>
<br>
Well, what do I tell him when I get there?<br>
<br>
Ask him politely to refund your money because you're too stupid to own a computer! (Tech hangs up)<br>
<br>
and last but not least:<br>
<br>
Customer: "Hi. I have a Macintosh. I had a disk that I wanted to put in the computer, but it wouldn't go, so I pushed harder, and it wouldn't go, so I pushed REALLY hard, and now it's making funny noises. I think there was a disk in there already." <br>
Tech Support: "Unplug the computer, now." <br>
Customer: "I don't want to lose my paper!" <br>
Tech Support: "Unplug the computer right now. Your paper is lost. Your floppy drive is lost. If you're lucky the Mac will be OK. Unplug it now." <br>
Customer: "But I don't want to lose my paper!" <br>
After a few more repetitions of this, I heard someone, presumably the client's roommate, scream. Then I heard the dorm fire alarm go off in the background. Those things are awful loud, but she didn't seem interested in unplugging the computer, fleeing the fire in her room, or anything else other than arguing with me. Figuring I was doing her a favor, I hung up. <br>
<br>
