If he is in w/ this guy i am sure the next person to get ripped off would like to have known. Are you then, willing to except responsibilty for paying then next victim back because no one can mention a name on these boards w/ out total concrete, substatiated evidence? <br>
<br>
WTF Everything on these boards is in someones opinion. And is here to be A) suported or B) refuted. And if benz isnt involved, he needs to  get his ass on the boards and explain whether he condones Geebus's actions.<br>
 <br>
 I will say again, THE GM'S TOLD ME THERE ARE MORE INVOLVED IN THIS THAN JUST DANDATE! what about that is hard for you morons to understand. So, yes. I would throw anyone who defends or condones this assholes actions into the same box.<br>

He had just gone two blocks away and burglarized, destroyed the property of, and criminally trespassed upon his ex-girlfriend's house.<br>
<br>
Was I in the wrong place at the wrong time? No, this act was avoidable. How was it avoidable? Simple, he was a trouble-maker, he'd been doing some shitty things all week, and he bragged to me all the time.<br>
<br>
It's already been stated that while on an alt, Benzor was heard bragging about Geebus going to give him items, about the lamentation scam, and that Geebus is his good friend.<br>
<br>
It's a bit more complicated than accusing someone by association. That doesn't hold up at all. What makes his statement even less credible is it's being made by a coward who can't even give his in-game name.<br>
<br>
If I recall as well, there were two people who blindly defended the accused, just as you are right now.<br>
<br>
I suggest you don't associate with Geebus or Benzor, or if you're one of the two yourself, realize the severity of being shitlisted. <br>
<br>
Those items you have will be worthless as long as GMs keep giving character names, you'll never ever see the high end game, and you'll have trouble finding groups later on. Among the...nicer...things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutilforse95.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brutil Forse95</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/22/01 11:25:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> EKG is Dandate</span><hr size=1> Obviusly EKG is Dandate because what other ass hole would defend a person who stole form over 20 people.....<br>

1) He is a 26th level Paladin.<br>
Maybe he doesn't know about Lanys.com. Its possible. I know, I know...EVERYONE knows about Lanys.com. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Maybe, he can't come here to defend himself because he doesn't know that this board exists. <br>
2) He bragged about getting equipment from Geebus.<br>
I'd brag about getting a Lam from a friend. I don't usually ask where my friends get stuff that they have given to me. I guess that teaches everyone to stop accepting gift from people cause they may get shitlisted for it.<br>
3) He condones Geebus' actions.<br>
Hmmm...I'm not sure about this. Do you mean he told you about the scam? Did you log and report this to the GMs? Or did you mean that he condones Geebus' actions because he is accepting his gifts. If its the former, I hope you /report 'ed it. If its the later, I hope that you understand that some people don't ask about gifts and some people don't know about the shitlist. I'm waiting for more information from Tell to make a decision on this point.<br>
<br>
So, is Benzor guilty of anything? Did anyone see him do anything wrong? Does his name deserve to be slandered? I don't think there is enough evidence and I think EKG is stated this fact. There is not enough evidence yet unless we get some more information to condemn Benzor. <br>
<br>
BTW, if you want to talk to me concerning this issue. I can be reached in game through tells. My game character IS Nizbar. Feel free to contact me about my views. Again, I do NOT support Geebus and his scamming. I don't particularly support anyone. I just think its really wrong to slander Benzor cause he talked about getting a lammie from a friend. Get some evidence and post it. Otherwise, leave his supposed &quot;friends&quot; out of it.<br>

I happen to believe Benzor and Geebus are two separate individuals, but it is guilt by association plain and simple, I don't remember you being in the group while he was talking his way here, unless you have grouped with them and listend to the chat, you really are reaching.<br>
<br>
I have stated the FACTS as I know them and if Benzor would come and sign in as himself and explain his disdain and abhorrance of Geebus's acts then that is a step in the right direction, his own words and actions have linked him to this scam and if you don't believe my word, then nothing I can say will disuade you. Nor do I really care.<br>
As I said before, he can come here and post his name instead of EKG and explain, I could owe him an apology and would do so if needed, but from my time spent with him, I think it was very evident he knew what was going on and at the very least condoned those actions.<br>
Had this not been a guildmate and been a single occurance, I may not of even posted here, but you screw over one of my guildmates and then pal around and defend that person, you get what you asked for.<br>
I kind of hope he does come here (Benzor) and does the right thing, so I have to apologize, I would do so with pleasure if I am wrong, but so far it appears I am not.<br>

Damn zone, everyone there is SOO greedy. <br>
<br>
BTW, I do think that this EGK bastard is either Benzor or Geebus. How could he have posted on the SL about Tell's actions in disbaning him from a group if Tell hadn't actually done it. <br>
<br>
Let's see: <br>
1) in his SL post on Tell (complete Bullshit), this calls Tell a dictator cuz he decides to enforce ML loot. Tell sez that that Benzor referred to him in this way in-game. <br>
2) EGK admits that GM was petitioned. Tell petitioned a GM to discuss the actions of Benzor.<br>
3) This guy claims that he was disbaned, and 3 ppl came with him. Tell says that he disbanned Benzor, and that Benzor convinced others to go with him.<br>
4) EGK has yet to post anything in his BUllshit SL claim; and I think he's just doing this in defence for Geebus. Stupid punk doesn't deny his association with Geebus, and the 2 stories I heard from both parties in the SL post directed towards Tell (again, no way in HELL I believe anything that Messiah piece of trash sez. I back my fellow guild-member TEll all the way. He's the man, I've grouped with him, he does nothing wrong. He did NOTHING wrong in the HK group. If it was me in that position, I would have done hte same thing). <br>
<br>
So Messiah, everyone knows you're either Benzor, or his BBB Geebus. So stop hiding behind ur anonymous tag and say who you are. Adn tell you're BBB to post here too.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unizbar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nizbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/22/01 9:25:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dandate/Sonedarin/Saralro/Geebus ...thief</span><hr size=1> Personally...I don't think you have STATED the facts. What did he say that makes you think that he had involvement or that he knew of the scams that Geebus was pulling off? You have stated that he said things that made you BELIEVE that he was associated. hmmm...I'd like to make the decision myself. Could you perhaps post some of the things that leads you to beleive that he is involved. That would be fact. You have posted your OPINION. I would like to see a brief idea of the things he said to convince you. It doesn't have to be exact, but a brief overview would be appreciated. <br>
<br>
As far as I can see...EKG could still be a friend that is relaying this story. Even if he is Benzor, he clearly states that he doesn't think that Geebus' actions are correct. He states in his posts that he isn't defend him. He IS cautioning us to look at the EVIDENCE rather than relying on conjecture. At this point, if I were Benzor, I wouldn't give my name here either. Many of you seem to be blinded by your anger. Again, if you clearly read the sequence of posts and how things were posted...you will find that EKG cautions us not to simple throw names around and shitlist people without looking at the facts. He also posts that he does not support the theif. Now...if you PRESENT facts, then perhaps we can all become informed on the situation. But, from reading all of these post careful, I can only gather that Benzor was excited about getting a Lammie from a friend. Please post some of the things that he said to make you believe that he was involved. Thanks.<br>

<br>
I shit-listed Dandate and Dandate alone. So yes, we should get back on track and be talking about him. <br>
<br>
I could care lees who benzor is, and whether or not he is a friend to Geebus. however, EKG has made a few idiotic posts on more than one thread, and still stands behind a mask. So until he reveals himself to all of us, he will continue to be flamed. So, in that regard ...you are fighting a losing battle Niz. He has shown himself to be quite an ass, and through his defiance in keeping his identity concealed, he has not given us any reason to believe he is not one of the people in cahoots w/ said perpetrator. We know there is another person involved, so quit w/ the defense of EKG ok NIZ....<br>
<br>
If you are a moron and you post stupid shit on the boards, you are going to get flamed.<br>
<br>
Especially when there are people involed who have yet to be named as accomplices.<br>
<br>
If EKG werent geebus or benzor I am pretty sure that he would have answered one of the many people asking for him to reveal his identity. Even in his own SL thread. He still has yet to do that, but continues to post, disregarding our requests.<br>
<br>
Niz your defense of benz is a correct one...he is not shit-listed and I am sure i would have taken some gear as a gift at his level also. But it is EKG...whom ever it is that i flame, not this benz guy. If you would read back ..no where in any of my posts did I mention his name until a number of others did first.<br>
<br>
So..What i ask of everyone, is that we leave Benzor out of this thread until more evidence of corroberation between the two is established.=o) that ok Niz?<br>
<br>
And btw..i love it when people come to the defense of others on the SL and the accounts first post is here.../hmmm<br>
makes one wonder...<br>

<br>
  Yes it is horrible what he did to us all not just the ones that he took from but the ones that feel that they must make it right. I sold off the things i had on my character to try to replace some of what he took. I then had some RL problems i needed to handle, So i took two weeks off from the game thinking that when i returned this crap would be over. I have greatly underestamated you all.<br>
  Yes this is just a game and yes if he is dishonest on the game then he is mostlikly the same way in RL, But who cares. Yes he got us all, and yes there is nothing we can do but go off the facts of the matter. We are all better then what i have been reading here. Lets list it.<br>
<br>
1) Yes Geebus is indeed Dandate this is fact Frizz himself pulled it up to let us know to watch for him<br>
<br>
2) Yes this person is shit<br>
<br>
3) As for EKG do any of you know who this person is? NO we dont so why do you all insist on making yourselves out to look just as bad as Dan?<br>
<br>
4) Yes EKG may or may not be Dan or a friend of his but who are we to say if he is or is not it is not our place to accuss him of this just becuase he defended him.<br>
<br>
5) EKG is right we should not Bad mouth or shit list people that are or have been around him. <br>
If indeed the players he has played in groups with and been around then i guess i myself am just as much a shit as he is for i have been around him before this happened.<br>
<br>
6) If we cant do anything else cant we just keep what we have to say based on facts and atleast keep it clean?<br>
<br>
  I mean my god folks i sold off my character to make things as right as they could be made by one person.<br>
<br>
 You all piss wine and moan about what was done to you, Well let me let you in on a secret.<br>
I am a 28 year old father of 2. who is at this very moment fighting to keep his kids after his wife of 7 years walked out on him. When i have had a long day fighting with her and i am depressed and feel like shit i turn to EQ to the people i have come to know and love. He took that away from me so know tell me who has been FUCKED, and who has the right to wine about.<br>
<br>
 If i can do what i did to stop this shit why cant the rest of you.<br>
<br>
                           Thank you <br>

I did not at the time realize how connected you were all to the game and how much it would hurt you, I figured you would all take it as &quot;just a game&quot;...My deepest apologies. I did start stealing however because I dislike Verant tremendously...you'd think with their millions in profits they could hire some non-union technical support and keep the servers from crashing...I do believe they are the Standard Oil Company of MMORPG. However there is nothing I can do to refund your things, I have already traded my account, got a nice deal for an uber wizard on another server because of all the nice things I had stolen. I'm sure the person I traded with will be uber pissed when you all start harrassing him =/. Anyway don't bother replying, flaming, bitching, crying, or moaning to me because I will not be coming back to this board or thread.<br>
