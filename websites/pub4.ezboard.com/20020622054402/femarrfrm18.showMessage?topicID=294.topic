Now, before you left-wingers go off on me, take a second to objectively consider the following.... Does a nation have the right to defend themselves while pursuing total victory? Is a complete and total victory &quot;genocide&quot;?<br><br>There has been much talk about &quot;let them have at it&quot; etc, but, are we really willing to let it happen? Would the US / UN let Israel or Palestine achieve &quot;total victory&quot;? It is something to consider.<br><br>I know that Mr. Ditto-head is pro Israel and its obvious from the quote below, however, he makes a point in calling out US policy and how it applies to [only] us - the US. This is what I meant earlier in a previous post about &quot;We do need to establish a clear set of standards that we apply to both nations….our standards, not theirs. ..&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;-Friday, December 7, 2001 <br>   <br>  The only way some form of quiet will ever exist in the Middle East is if Israel is given the latitude to totally defeat its declared enemies. Only then will the terrorist attacks on Israel's civilians come to an end. Perpetual negotiations, diplomatic half measures, or land for peace deals will not bring peace to the Middle East. For those who believe this is an irresponsible notion, I use history as my guide. <br><br>Today marks the 60th anniversary of Imperial Japan's unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor, in which 2,500 Americans were killed. There are lessons to be learned from our victory in that war. <br><br>In his April 16, 1945 address before a Joint Session of Congress, President Harry Truman stated: &quot;So there can be no possible misunderstanding, both Germany and Japan can be certain, beyond any shadow of doubt, that America will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance remains. We are deeply conscious of the fact that much hard fighting is still ahead of us. Having to pay such a heavy price to make complete victory certain, America will never become a party to any plan for partial victory. To settle for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize the future security of the world. Our demand has been, and it remains, unconditional surrender.&quot; <br><br>On August 6, 1945, just 16-hours after the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, Truman issued a statement which said, in part: &quot;The Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor. They have been repaid many fold. … We are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories, and their communications. Let there be no mistake: we shall completely destroy Japan's power to make war.&quot; <br><br>Truman understood that there could be no peace without total victory. This lesson has not been lost on President George Bush. On September 20, 2001, Bush also addressed a Joint Session of Congress and announced America's policy - &quot;the Bush Doctrine&quot; - in responding to the atrocities of September 11. He stated: &quot; … Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.&quot; <br><br>Bush stated further: &quot; … We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.&quot; <br><br>Since September 11, Bush has refused all offers by the Taliban regime to negotiate any settlement of the war - including the status of Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenants in the al Qaeda terrorist network - short of outright surrender. As Bush once eloquently put it: bin Laden is &quot;wanted, dead or alive.&quot; And for over two months, the U.S. has been systematically bombing the Taliban and al Qaeda day and night. Already, the Bush administration is planning the next phase of the war, which may involve U.S. military action in Iraq, Somalia and elsewhere. <br><br>So, in the two most recent examples of the U.S. being attacked on its own territory, America's predicate for peace has been the total annihilation of its enemies. And there is every reason to expect Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to have learned the same lesson. <br><br>Since 1948, Israel has been forced to fight 4 wars with the hostile nations surrounding her. Despite defeating her enemies on the battlefield, the international community has never permitted Israel to completely destroy any of these regimes - none of which are democracies. They've always been left largely in tact, free to start or support another war, including the current terrorist war now being waged against Israel's citizens. And between wars, Israel's enemies have convinced the world, including the U.S., that her borders and security are not only legitimate subjects of constant negotiations, but that Israel's refusal to accept most, if not all, of her enemies' demands is an obstacle to peace. <br><br>This week Hamas and other terrorist groups - which, like certain of the countries that surround Israel, seek the destruction of Israel, not co- existence or even the establishment of a Palestinian state - intensified their war against the Jewish state by unleashing 5 fanatic suicide bombers against innocent civilians, mostly children. The result: hundreds of casualties, including 26 dead. In the past 14 months, more than 230 Israelis have been killed - the proportional equivalent to the U.S. losing some 11,000 people. <br><br>In addition to Hamas, which receives support from Palestinian expatriates, wealthy Saudi Arabians, and Iran, Israel is under attack from, among others, Hizballah, which is supported by Syria and Iran, and Islamic Jihad, which is backed by Iran, Sudan and militant Islamic groups. <br><br>On December 4, in an address to his nation, Sharon stated: &quot; … A war has been forced upon us. A war of terror. A war that claims innocent victims daily. A war of terror being conducted systematically, in an organized fashion, and with methodical direction. … We will pursue those responsible, the perpetrators of terrorism and the supporters. We will pursue them until we catch them, and they will pay a price.&quot; <br><br>Ironically, the major obstacle to Sharon implementing the Bush Doctrine has been U.S. Middle East policy. When attacked by terrorists, Israel has been urged to show &quot;restraint,&quot; to make more negotiated concessions and even accept the creation of a hostile Palestinian state on its border. This week's carnage appears to have caused some positive change in America's rhetoric and position. The president has now pointed the finger of responsibility directly at Yassar Arafat for ending the terrorism committed by his people. But accomplishing peace requires more - much more. <br><br>Truman was right to insist that peace would only be realized after the &quot;obliteration&quot; of the Japanese war machine, just as Bush is right about &quot;defeating&quot; the Taliban, al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. It is, therefore, necessary that in the pursuit of real and lasting peace, Israel also be free to destroy its enemies - meaning the terrorists and, yes, their sponsors, who are at war with her, and that she do so before they obtain devastating weapons of mass destruction. &quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br> <br> <br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>54</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 501<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/19/02 4:02:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=294.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The right to defend...</span><hr size=1> <i>"Now, before you left-wingers go off on me..."</i><br><br>Jes<b></b>sus Fu<b></b>cking Ch<b></b>rist, Joesph and Mary. Rheaton here you go again!<br><br><pause><br><br>Hold on let me read the post further, then I can go off on you objectively! :)<br><br><i>"Does a nation have the right to defend themselves while pursuing total victory? Is a complete and total victory "genocide"?</i><br><br>No, and yes. Let me explain.<br><br>"Pursuing total victory" means, if anything, using whatever tools are at our disposal to force the enemy to unconditionally surrender. Ditto head misapplies history due to his ignorance of history. The Japan in the 1940s is completely different from the Palestine of today. Nothwithstanding the homogenous nature and isolation of the Island country, Japan held to a strict militaristic discipline of traditional warfare. From their perspective, it was more honorable to die rather than surrender, but not at all costs. Hence, when the US nuked Japan surrender was forthcoming.<br><br>Ditto head doesn't understand that Palestine is not homogenous, it is not an Island, and those fighting don't understand traditional military discipline; instead, they resort to guerrilla and terrorist tactics to wage war. What this means is that even if Israel dropped nukes on Palestinians they will not surrender. They will wage war until there is not a single Palestinian alive.<br><br>Israel has no right to defend itself under the terms of pursuing total victory, in this case, since it entails the complete destruction of the Palestinian peoples. In short, the greater good is served with Israel pulling back to it's 1967 borders and leaving Palestinians alone.<br><br>A complete and total victory doesn't entail genocide. However, given the Palestinian problem we can expect that Palestinians will never surrender under any circumstances. Hence, if Israel pursues a "complete and total victory" (as defined above) they will have to wipe out each and every Palestinian.<br><br>Another fallacy Ditto head is guilty of is painting all Arabs with the same brush. He assumes that all Arabs hate Israel and will stop at nothing short than to see every Jew slaughtered and dumped into a large hole in the ground. That is the furthest from the truth as I know it and is certainly not the way of Islam. Arabs only require that Israel open up Jersusalem (via partioning it off) and that they recognise a Palestinian state (which entails moving back to their 1967 borders). They have handed an olive branch to Israel who has promptly spit upon it. I have to go.. more to come. :)<br> <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer <BR><BR>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/19/02 6:14:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=294.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The right to defend...</span><hr size=1> Horse feathers!<br><br>Doesn't the US have the &quot;right&quot; to shut down, or attempt to, every terrorist organization that poses a threat?

Israel did a GREAT job in keeping the innocent separate from the 'guilty'.   Most likely did a better job then the US does in regards.<br><br>    JENIN, West Bank — Palestinian officials yesterday put the death toll at 56 in the two-week Israeli assault on Jenin, dropping claims of a massacre of 500 that had sparked demands for a U.N. investigation. Top Stories <br><br>     The official Palestinian body count, which is not disproportionate to the 33 Israeli soldiers killed in the incursion, was disclosed by Kadoura Mousa Kadoura, the director of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement for the northern West Bank, after a team of four Palestinian-appointed investigators reported to him in his Jenin office.<br>     [Two weeks ago, when European and particularly London newspapers were reporting estimates of &quot;hundreds&quot; massacred, Israeli sources in Washington said they expected the Palestinian toll to reach &quot;45 to 55.&quot;]<br>     U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested yesterday, in the wake of the Palestinian body count, that he may disband a U.N. fact-finding team that was to visit the camp to determine whether a massacre had taken place.<br>     Mr. Annan was responding to a decision by the Israeli security Cabinet earlier in the day not to cooperate with the U.N. team.<br>     The U.N.-Israeli dispute appeared unrelated to the Palestinian admission there had been no massacre.<br>     The Palestinians had suggested that most of the bodies were buried beneath the rubble of houses bulldozed by Israeli troops. No digging for bodies was taking place here, and there was no stench that could have come from decaying human flesh.<br>     The earlier Palestinian claims had sparked international outrage and prompted the Bush administration to press Israel to accept a fact-finding mission by the United Nations, an organization that the Jewish state regards as having a pro-Palestinian bias.<br>     Mr. Kadoura yesterday showed a reporter for The Washington Times the official Palestinian list of those who died. It contained 50 names. Six additional bodies, he said, had not been identified.<br>     He no longer used the ubiquitous Palestinian charge of &quot;massacre&quot; and instead portrayed the battle as a &quot;victory&quot; for Palestinians in resisting Israeli forces. &quot;Here the Israelis, who tried to break the Palestinian willpower, have been taught a lesson,&quot; Mr. Kadoura said.<br>     He insisted that Israel had tried but failed, thanks to the heavy fighting, to destroy the entire warren of homes in the camp that had housed 11,000 people.<br>     The destruction, pictured graphically on television, appeared linked to Israeli bulldozing of the houses from which the remnant of the resistance forces were firing.<br>     In fact, it covers the size of a large football field and constitutes only about 10 percent of the housing in the camp, and a far smaller proportion of the housing in the city, which was largely left untouched by the Israeli incursion.<br>     The figures shown to The Times included 233 injured persons, mainly men. The figures revealed that 18 persons had been injured and one had died after the fighting had ended, the result of accidentally detonating either shells left after the fighting, or booby traps that were set by Palestinian gunmen throughout the camp.<br>     A British expert attached to the International Red Cross said these booby traps were almost identical to those used by the Irish Republican Army.<br>     The British claim suggested to analysts that IRA guerrillas were schooled in terrorist weaponry and irregular warfare, as were many radical guerrilla movements, in Palestinian, Syrian and Iranian training camps in Lebanon.<br>     From behind a desk bedecked by portraits of Mr. Arafat, a string of past &quot;martyrs&quot; and of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the Palestinian chief official in the city, who is also the Fatah leader, portrayed in an interview the events as another chapter in a long saga of resistance to foreign invaders — from Crusader times onward — that, he said, had made Jenin &quot;the heart of Palestine&quot; for centuries.<br>     The propaganda war continues, meanwhile, in the refugee camp itself. Families whose homes had been destroyed were ordered to sit and lie inside tents pitched near the destruction, to be available for interviews and filming with foreign reporters and photographers. At dusk, with the press opportunities concluded, they returned to houses offered to them in the undamaged city or in the rest of the refugee camp.<br>     Other young men, members of various factions, have been on duty in the camp's narrow streets, eager to conduct foreign correspondents to places where they say Israelis killed militants after they surrendered or had been captured.<br>     Others in the city say the resistance to the Israeli incursion had been carried out by only about 10 percent of the militants who had originally been in the area. Most had retreated into the hills or into city back streets as the Israelis entered the area, they said.<br>     Families living in houses directly opposite the destroyed area have told The Washington Times that Israeli soldiers, who temporarily occupied their houses just before the final battle began, treated them without violence and assured them: &quot;You will not be harmed.&quot;<br>     They confined the 36 members of the Abu Khalil family to two rooms, allowing them out one by one, and set up a snipers' point upstairs through two holes in the wall — under a family framed message in Arabic: &quot;There is No God but Allah and Mohammed is His Messenger.&quot;<br>     They confiscated identity cards but left them on the table before slipping out during the night.<br>     At the United Nations in New York, Undersecretary-General Kieran Prendergast said &quot;a thorough, credible and balanced report on recent events in Jenin refugee camp would not be possible without the cooperation of the government of Israel.&quot;<br>     &quot;Since it appears from today's Cabinet statement by Israel that the difficulties in the way of deployment of the fact-finding team will not be resolved anytime soon, the secretary-general is minded to disband the team,&quot; he told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council.<br>     Diplomats said Mr. Prendergast told council members that Mr. Annan was leaning toward disbanding the three-member team, which has been joined by numerous advisers. The team, which was to have arrived in Jenin on Saturday, remained in Geneva yesterday.<br>     The Security Council is to take up the issue of whether or not to disband the mission at a meeting today.<br>     The United States put forward the resolution adopted by the Security Council welcoming the dispatch of a U.N. team to find out what happened in Jenin during the Israeli military's attacks.<br>     Israel initially agreed to the idea, but subsequently raised questions over the composition of the team, its scope of inquiry, who could be called as a witness and what documents would be presented to the panel.<br>     Mr. Prendergast said that &quot;with every passing day, it becomes more difficult to determine what happened&quot; in Jenin. U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte said Mr. Annan was considering whether to let the fact-finding team begin its work in Geneva or &quot;simply abandoning the mission on the assumption that satisfactory terms of reference could not be worked out.&quot;<br>    <br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/world/20020501-5587072.htm">www.washtimes.com/world/2...587072.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br> <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font color=#00bb00>to</font><font color=#00aa00>n</font> <font color=#009900>St</font><font color=#009900>or</font><font color=#008800>m</font><font color=#007700>ca</font><font color=#006600>st</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>54</font><font color=#00cc00>th</font> <font color=#00bb00>Se</font><font color=#00aa00>as</font><font color=#009900>on</font> <font color=#008800>Ma</font><font color=#007700>gi</font><font color=#006600>ci</font><font color=#005500>an</font><BR><font color=#00dd00>Co</font><font color=#00cc00>un</font><font color=#00bb00>ci</font><font color=#00aa00>l o</font><font color=#009900>f U</font><font color=#008800>nb</font><font color=#007700>ro</font><font color=#006600>ke</font><font color=#005500>n H</font><font color=#004400>on</font><font color=#003300>or</font></B><BR><a href="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://unbrokenhonor.homestead.com/files/rheaton5.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 433<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/6/02 6:20:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=294.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The right to defend...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2002/05/jenin0503.htm">www.hrw.org/press/2002/05/jenin0503.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br><br>Among the twenty-two civilian deaths documented during this investigation were the following:<br><br>    * Fifty-seven-year-old Kamal Zghair, a wheelchair-bound man who was shot and then run over by IDF tanks on April 10 as he was moving in his wheelchair equipped with a white flag down a major road in Jenin;<br><br>    * Thirty-seven-year-old Jamal Fayid, a paralyzed man, who was crushed in the rubble of his home on April 7 after IDF soldiers refused to allow his family the time to remove him from their home before a bulldozer destroyed it;<br><br>    * Fourteen-year-old Faris Zaiben, who was killed by fire from an IDF armored car as he went to buy groceries when the IDF-imposed curfew was finally lifted on April 11; and<br><br>* Fifty-two-year-old 'Afaf Disuqi, who was killed on April 5 by an explosive charge that IDF soldiers had placed at her front door as she went to open it for the soldiers;<br><br>In one case involving a wounded Palestinian militant, IDF soldiers for several hours prevented medical help from reaching him. The soldiers then killed the man, who had been left close to a hospital near the camp and was no longer armed or taking active part in the fighting.<br><br>Human Rights Watch also found evidence of indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force by the IDF. U.S.-supplied helicopters fired anti-tank missiles and other ordinance into the camp, in some cases making insufficient efforts to identify legitimate military targets and avoid hitting civilian houses. The helicopters struck many houses in Jenin refugee camp that were inhabited only by civilians, and where no Palestinian fighters were present. In one of many such cases, a tank shell and two helicopter-fired TOW anti-tank missiles hit the house of Kamal Tawalba, a father of fourteen children, on April 6. No fighters were present in the home. When Tawalba and his family tried to leave their burning home, IDF soldiers in the vicinity shot at them.<br><br>In another case, a sixty-year-old woman was killed when a helicopter fired a missile directly into her top-floor apartment although there were no armed Palestinians in the building or the immediate vicinity.  <p>----------------------------------<br>[58 Troubadour]<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78662">Maeri</a>&lt;Anlah'Shok&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 562<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/6/02 7:38:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=294.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The right to defend...</span><hr size=1> I think Maeri provided good examples of the War Crimes, Rheaton.

There was some concern from the Vatican (and Ireland) that the definition of Crimes Against Humanity, which mentions forced pregnancy in the section on rape etc, could be used against laws banning abortion. The wording now includes: &quot;Forced pregnancy&quot; means the unlawful confinement of a woman forcibly made pregnant, with the intent of affecting the ethnic composition of any population or carrying out other grave violations of international law.
