Someone else would take over pulls and then he would come back and double pull. He was afk so long a few times that we removed him from the group. Finally everyone had enough and said, &quot;If he come back in the group I'm leaving&quot;. Even while grouped he was shouting to the zone for someone to PL him. He went on the list that night. <br>
 Later I saw him selling in EC and heard many complaints about him there. Then several months later I log on and see him in Guild Chat. WTF? He smooth talked his way in by sucking up to a few people. I sent a tell to the Guild leadership, they looked into his rep and he was removed the next day. All his troubles have been brought on by his behavior, or lack of it. Good luck in the next adventure Freez. A last word of advice. Even if your only 13 or something...time to grow up bud. You need to act maturely in EQ for people to truly respect you.<br>

<br>
I have had several dealings with FF. I heard of his rep but still took him along on a Vox raid and allowed him on my Kael roster.<br>
<br>
On the Vox raid, we got wiped out (I wasn't leading this one BTW). During the fight, he FDed, and took off as soon as he could. He didn't help with CR.<br>
<br>
On the Kael raids, he showed he could be a competent puller, but he would not shutup in channel. He would send tells to me to let him random on any items.<br>
<br>
Also, we conducted our plans through email. I was using Outlook, so anyone could just hit reply all and a message would be sent to all on the list. Well, the roster was for me to pass on the plans, not for everyone to beg for help nwith stuff. If they wanted help, they could pass me an email and I'd add it in my next update.<br>
<br>
FF used it to ask for help with his epic. I warned him, he did it again, so I warned him again. He did it a third time, as well as sending me some really abnoxios emails. He was kicked from it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulorelorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lorelorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/26/02 10:55:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3574.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Freezingfists</span><hr size=1> Bye.<br>

Freezingfists first made my ignore list I *think* during the whole 150kpp Fungi auction ordeal back in the EC days.<br>
<br>
Later, I met him in Lguk, where he was farming a chainable epic drop admittedly for cash.  I found that slightly distasteful, but to each his own.  After the brief conversation I had with him, he went back on ignore.<br>
<br>
Later, I joined Medion's short-lived e-mail listing for Kael raids.<br>
Freezingfists was also on that roster.  Several times he pulled for the raid, and at various points was placed in my group.<br>
I took him off my ignore list that first raid, as having the puller on ignore can be dangerous when I was the primary slower. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As a monk, he proved himself competent to pull Arena, and pulled his share of the weight in group.  He did have a tendency to go AFK w/o warning, and often used the raid # when it wasn't necessary.  His personality was a bit annoying, but nothing evil or rude.  I re-evaluated him at that time and have kept him off my /ignore list.<br>
<br>
FF hasn't made being popular one of his priorities, as evidenced by the Helius thread, and this thread <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub32.ezboard.com/fkeeperfrm7.showMessage?topicID=46.topic"> here </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> on my former guild's boards (which also references the Helius thread).<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, it was his decision to publicly announce quitting the game.  I'm sure if he's changed his mind, FF regrets posting publicly here his intentions to leave the game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   He has my sympathy.  I offered to help on his epic in LoIO a few weeks ago, but he couldn't gather sufficent forces, and I wasn't going to sit around forever waiting.  I'll STILL help if he can get the clerics &amp; DPS required for that battle &amp; guild responsibilities aren't keeping me busy.  I can get to LoIO pretty quickly any time via Cabilis firepot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If FF did any of the things you suggested (and the greed and selfishness ascribed to him by others would be in keeping with what you said), then he is a pathetic human being.  However, your initial posts suggested a lack of culpability on the part of the woman involved, and that's not right.<br>
<br>
In any event, it's usually best to leave real life out of the game and off the board. <p>-- The <select><option>SOB</option><option>Grump</option><option>Bastard</option><option>pwner of Chiteng</option></select> formerly known as Raedwulf</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=freezingfists>Freezingfists</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/27/02 4:42:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3574.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm ya ok medion</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Originally posted by Medion<br>
To clear up a few things...<br>
<br>
I have had several dealings with FF. I heard of his rep but still took him along on a Vox raid and allowed him on my Kael roster.<br>
<br>
On the Vox raid, we got wiped out (I wasn't leading this one BTW). During the fight, he FDed, and took off as soon as he could. He didn't help with CR.<br>
<br>
On the Kael raids, he showed he could be a competent puller, but he would not shutup in channel. He would send tells to me to let him random on any items.<br>
<br>
Also, we conducted our plans through email. I was using Outlook, so anyone could just hit reply all and a message would be sent to all on the list. Well, the roster was for me to pass on the plans, not for everyone to beg for help nwith stuff. If they wanted help, they could pass me an email and I'd add it in my next update.<br>
<br>
FF used it to ask for help with his epic. I warned him, he did it again, so I warned him again. He did it a third time, as well as sending me some really abnoxios emails. He was kicked from it. <br>

Your not telling whole truth or whole story here.  You were the one leading this raid u were the one who posted it on boards and the one who was leading.  Were in buff hall and about to charge u charge and u mr super leader runs straight instead of taking first left and u run have the raid crew into one of the pits then someone ends up training vox to buff hall.  So what do i do i run. I tried to fd then her ae hit me so i had to get up i ran out as far as i could then /q ed cause i didnt feel like dieing.  Not my fault that u were an incompetent leader and didn't know wtf u were doing.  Not my fault that u got half the raid crew killed and not my fault that someone trained vox.  O and to guy who i married his wife in game.  I've never said anything bad about you for one.  She told me u beat the crap out of her for marrying me ingame and u went to jail and you guys were getting divorced and thats the last i heard from her.  Shes been on once since ive gotten married to her so i dont know whats up.<br>

You and Tumyeto both /t me out of the blue &quot;ROFL you payed 25k for an RFS?!!!! YOU DUMB!!11!11!&quot; .  How you even knew i never guessed, maybe there is a serverwide gimp channel that you people use or something.<br>
<br>
Lets just say my first impression wasn't top of the notch, and it's small wonder to me why so many people feel the way they do about you.  On the flip side you never seemed to care what other people thought of you, which is something to be proud of, i think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
However, I envy you for quitting.  If you stay away from this game, you will succede where several people in the past have failed.  Good luck with RL and may you choose your actions wisely in the future.<br>
