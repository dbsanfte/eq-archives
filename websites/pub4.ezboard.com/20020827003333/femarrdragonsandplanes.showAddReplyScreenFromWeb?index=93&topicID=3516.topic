There is NOTHING I can say that<br>
will convince you. Why do you even want me to try? Besides, he is ALSO<br>
an abusive player.  Ok what did I see? With my own dark black eyes?<br>
<br>
I saw two clowns I had never seen before. You know I dont remember if he had a pet out. Isnt that weird? But anyway, I never would have noticed if Remdar had not said 'Son of a bitch, its 'S'<br>
So as is my way when I dont know what the hell people mean, I said<br>
Who the hell is 'S'?<br>
Remdar - He is level 30?(memory fails me here between 30 and 34 anyways)<br>
Chiteng - So?<br>
Remdar - That makes him the highest level player on the server at the moment.<br>
Chiteng - So?<br>
Remdar - Never mind Chiteng, hold up on the next pull please.<br>
<br>
But player 'S' isnt alone there is another player with him, lets call him player 'K'<br>
I had no clue to this day what class player 'K' was.<br>
But they are both on the west side of the Courtyard by the fence. <br>
Player 'S' starts casting, and casting, and casting, and casting...<br>
Remdar casts something, no idea what. About this time I realize that Remdar<br>
is talking to this guy with tells. After I guess maybe 10 minutes:<br>
<br>
Player 'K' opens the side door and walks in. Now you have to understand,<br>
not a whole lot of people had done that yet. The last time I had seen it,<br>
Barak had walked in that door, and 5 seconds later I saw his life stats<br>
fall 75%. He didnt yell train, he pounded that door and all I saw was a freeze frame<br>
of Barak with like a dozen ickies on his ass. So I had a healty respect for that door.<br>
(oddly enough Barak actually lived he was a good tank)<br>
So when I saw 'K' just walk up to the door and walk in, THAT got my interest.<br>
My postion was by the tree with Remdar. <br>
Anyway suddenly 'S' starts casting, He moves to the fence and it looked like<br>
(to me) that he had straddled the fence somehow, (you must remember this was<br>
all happening VERY fast)<br>
Suddenly, player 'K' runs out the door. I didnt see anything following him<br>
right away. He backed up to a point north of the tree. But 'S' stayed in/near<br>
the fence. Suddenly, well you all know what is in unrest inside that building<br>
including the basement walked out that door.<br>
Remdar - @#%$! (cast - no idea what - hell I am not a cleric)<br>
Chiteng - huh? (I was of course already FD'ed)<br>
<br>
I must apoligize at this point - I am NOT a necro. EVERYTHING I know about necros<br>
would not fill a stamp. I cant tell you what he cast I will just tell you what I saw.<br>
<br>
As they came out the door, player 'S' hit the leading mobs with some spell, it looked blue to me, and it seemed to me to affect more than one mob. <br>
They ALL ran over to 'K' and proceeded to make a 'K' shaped hole in the ground.<br>
He didnt even try to run. He just stood there. Player 'S' threw another spell<br>
and it lighted up BOTH him and &quot;K' <br>
<br>
About this time the train started to spread, and other players started to get hit.<br>
OOC started to spam.<br>
<br>
Remdar - didnt even move. He just stood there. He did NOT cast.<br>
I must comment here that Remdar, however much he exploited, was a damn good player, and I had learned to trust his judgement. <br>
<br>
Player 'S' cast again, and this time one of the mob on 'K' went DOWN, and I mean<br>
DOWN. But it was too late. Player 'K' died horribly. His body laid in that CY for a whole week. He never even looted it.<br>
<br>
I could hear player 'S' Casting but I could no longer see what was going on. I am sure you all have been in an unrest train. I think they even had the hand out.<br>
<br>
Eventually things literally died out. All I saw was the long line of undead shuffling<br>
back to the house.<br>
<br>
So I sent player 'S' a tell - 'what the hell was that?' - no responce<br>
<br>
Then it suddenly dawned on me. No one else was alive in Unrest but us three.<br>
<br>
I must admit, I was not quick on the uptake, it suddenly dawned on me.<br>
Player &quot;S' was totally untouched by it all. Not a scratch. He had not even been <br>
noticed by the mobs. They poured right past him. <br>
So like an idiot I said - How the hell did you do that? Not a scratch on you?<br>
No responce.<br>
<br>
At that time all hell broke loose in OOC. With LOTS of unhappy people asking who did that.<br>
<br>
So since I got no answer from 'S', I asked Remdar<br>
Chiteng - How the hell did he avoid dying?<br>
Remdar - Not now Chit, help me pull bodies to the front.<br>
Chiteng - sure, Im on it. <br>
<br>
And that Ice is how I know how many people died.<br>
<br>
I took a SS because I had never seen a hag before but sadly It is long long gone.<br>
<br>
&quot; S&quot; vanished. I dont know how. I do know he didnt walk past me.<br>
<br>
Much later that night:<br>
<br>
Chiteng - So why arnt you dead?<br>
Remdar - invis to undead and moving fast<br>
Chiteng - whats invis to undead?<br>
Remdar - its just a spell that clerics get.<br>
Chiteng - Is that how he lived too?<br>
Remdar - I dont think so.<br>
Chiteng - why not?<br>
<br>
Remdar WAS this patient. Really too bad he exploited. He was a nice guy otherwise.<br>
<br>
Remdar - because I dont think you can cast DD and stay invis.<br>
Chiteng - WTF is DD?<br>
Remdar - Nevermind Chit, just pull another one.<br>
<br>
later<br>
<br>
Chiteng - How in hell did he avoid dying?<br>
Remdar - well I am not sure, but I 'think' it was the fence<br>
Chiteng - THE FENCE????????<br>
Remdar - or the porch, yeah there are some spots in every dungeon where you can stand and the mobs cant hit you.<br>
Chiteng - Really? Jeez they should fix that @#%$.<br>
Remdar - Chit the game has only been open 26 days, give them a chance.<br>
<br>
And THAT Ice is how I recall what the day was. Not really a mystery is it?<br>
<br>
<br>
I will add here that 'S' never said a damn thing about the cause of the train.<br>
Never apologized to the crowd.<br>
<br>
So, I wish to emphasize here that since 'S' has never deigned to explain<br>
diddly, this is only 1/2 of the story. <br>
<br>
Later on after bugging practicly everyone I knew I found out that Unrest<br>
had several such spots, all related to the graphics. I dont know if its true.<br>
It didnt interest me, until MUCH later.<br>
<br>
Ok Skerry, that is what I saw, in Unrest, that night.<br>
<br>
There were however a couple more incidents in Lguk.<br>
<br>
<br>
(as for my apparent dumbassness, I dont believe in not telling the whole story<br>
if it wasnt monk related, I simply wasnt interested. The word is 'focus')<br>
