VS is the most fought over mob on this forum. Why? becuase of the rotation. when Magister finishes up its wiz epics we will  relinquish VS for all time. The legs are trash, i wouldnt even put those on my twinks.<br>
<br>
The first 2 months of FFA  maybe VS will be quickiekilled but after that interest will drop sharply to the point of him remaining up for weeks on end.<br>
<br>
Go FFA and move on already. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742"target="_blank">

As far as Subby and Torm go.. that's hard for me to even try to think about because yes, both are friends of mine. I refuse to take a side in it.  The only one in know in game more hard headed then the 2 of them is me.. gah a fine grp we made. heh.  I digress....<br>
<br>
As far as VS rotation, there is only a simple lack of communication for whatever reason.  I would hate to see VS go FFA over all this like some people think it should.  Maybe if one leader per say was delegated in the pick up groups rotation or 2 leaders.. whatever, and everyone who needs to go goes.... just my 2 cents... <p><font color=magenta>Fori Shadowmoon</font><P>

Ive kept myself from speaking to sage or jumping into his flames since the time he flamed me in the Valric post and called every one of my friends &quot;cronies&quot;.  His constant pokes, egotism throughout all of this rant, aligned with Torms views and kiss my ass attitude, was typical.  After reading over all of that I find out he subtly disgraces Submina, well its my duty as a friend to Sub to get involved.

I will not respond to Submina as she knows the reasons, and due to people, like Malamber, I will not make it a public spectacle, which would almost make friends choose sides over it, which Submina is content in doing.  Oh yes Submina, I've had several tells from mutual friends asking why you were starting your smear campaign.  It's funny really.<br>
You can believe whatever you want from what she told you, however until you get both sides of the story you can blow your opinions out your ass.<br>
<br>
Gorndax, the issue of the 9 group raid to Fear is a rarity to us.  We rarely take over 6 groups, ask anyone.  The reason for it last night?  Because Dracoliche was up, in addition to Fright, Dread and Terror.  Why is this so important?  Our raid has never seen these golems up and so many people on our list wanted just a shot at the random.  It was because of this that we bent our 6 group rule and allowed extra people, so they could have a shot.  We had so many shamans last night asking to be on it, in addition to warriors and we just had to draw the line somewhere.  Tell me where that's such a bad thing?  Our confidence level is just fine however, thank you.<br>

<br>
I'm sure that Submina's version makes us look pretty bad, Gorn.  I can assure you that the connection between her version and reality is tenuous at best.  Anyway, I'm not going to get mad at you for coming to the defense of your guildmate.<br>
<br>
As for us having 8-9 groups last night, that was a LOT more than we would have liked.  We like to run our raids with about six groups.  Last night, it seemed like half the server showed up in Feerott.  We actually had to turn away a fair number of people, which is something that we hate to do.  We like to give people from small guilds a chance to go on a raid, and many of our participants are under level 51 and are inexperienced on raids.<br>
<br>
We handled the break-in with four groups of seasoned raiders, then brought in the horde.  We split the raiding group into two task forces with separate main assists, and it went pretty well.  By the time we fought Dread, we had consolidated the raid down to seven groups, which was much more manageable.<br>
<br>
To say the least, that is not the way that we would run a VS raid.  But I think you already knew that.<br>
<br>
If you don't like the way we run raids, that's your privilege.  We never force anyone to attend one of our raids.  If someone does not like our style, they don't have to join us. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

Submina said she was banned from my former guild the Silvermist  Wolves. I was the guild leader,so I know what happened. <br>
<br>
1) Torm and myself had grown tired of leading a guild and wanted to join one of the uber guilds,so we left SW( it did not work out,but we have no ill will towards any guilds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
2)Alot of our former guildmates decided to deguild after we left.<br>
<br>
3) Submina decided to try to get into RoD and went on a raid with them to   ToV. During this raid, she dropped the SW guild tag. Here is her post from the SW board saying she was leaving. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fsilvermistwolvesfrm4.deleteSingle?topicID=132.topic&index=18">pub37.ezboard.com/fsilver...c&index=18</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
4) After that,she went her own way, I never told her she was not welcome to be a SW,neither did Torm.  <br>
<br>
I did not like being accused of banning her from my former guild,when I did not  do it. I can  say, I was accused, because as Leader, it was always my final decision  if someone was to be kicked out.<br>
<br>
Again, I can give a rats ass if torm and you are fighting, Sub. And Torm being my RL fiancee has nothing to do with it either. I have always tried to keep my personal feelings out of what was best  for the SW. I even had to punish a couple of RL friends and had them guild removed. If you are gonna accuse an entire guild of doing you wrong,please make sure it actually happened. <p>Tormentcia

Granted they may not be entirely the same in game and in real life as they portray themselves on this board, but how they act, what they say, how they treat people here does reflect truth on what they are really like.<br>
<br>
I have read many differnent posts by the two of them. What I have read reflects the kind of person I would not want to know. They accuse people of stuff that doesn't happen, then when someone who was there and knows it didn't comes to refute their accusation they make excuses instead of appologizing (see Valric thread). They take every oppurtunity to bash those they don't like (see the many times Torm has insulted Darmu). They try to force another raid leader to bend to their rules saying her own are not fair (see the Jex/Vet thread). And of course bitch because they want to run a VS raid but another person beat them to it(this thread). <br>
<br>
Everything we have seen from the two of them has been Holier-Than-Thou BS and frankly I would not want to get to know these two people. I am sure Gorndax feels the same way that I do. All I know of their character is they are arrogant pricks, why would I want to know more?<br>
<br>
I am not surprised you would defend your friend, in fact I think it is an honorable thing to do. But don't be surprised that we don't like them, don't say we obviously know nothing about them. We know enough to stay away and that is good enough for me.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what happen between Submina and Torm but honestly I would believe Submina, because she is my friend, and I dont believe she would lie to me.  <p><div align=right><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33250><img src=http://www.eqeclipse.com/kiesig.jpg></img></a></div><BR>

As far as the sudject of raiding VS, if either group of people invite me I will go and enjoy. I will not take any stance between other peoples private and personal business, nor will I let it cloud my judgement as to whom I will raid with. It only saddens me to see friendships in jeapordy. As far as how many groups went to fear, who cares, next time lets go up with 15 groups, it has no bearing nor importance to anything pertaining to VS and the pickup slot. For that matter the personal mudslinging has nothing to do with the controversy over VS either. lets just put together the needed people to take out VS and go kill the bastard.<br>

I suppose I would be the same way.  There are just soo many good people here, you, Gorndax, Submina, Sagemon, Torm.  All of them.  Some I know better than others, granted, but it's incredibly frustrating to see this for me and others.<br>
<br>
Perhaps perspectives will change eventually.  I sure hope so. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27492"><img src=http://inferno.wittsend.com/smw/sig.jpg></a>

<br>
I was not trying to join RoD, actually at the time I was waiting for Radient Eclipse to join and Fori invited me to come with RoD to their ToV raid with them which I was eager to experience, this is not to say that I did not have some nice positive feedback from the RoD members saying they liked me, which by all accounts they did, I was not vying for entry though.<br>
<br>
Torm, Sage, my &quot;version&quot; is there for everyone to see in black and white, feel free to poke at it and correct it if you think it needs it, I dont see any point of lying about it, and as for creating a smear campaign, I would not do that, so you can laugh all you want, I'm annoyed at how you treated me, sure I might have been hot headed when I was talking to you on the day in question, but I was pissed off at the matter and you made it worse by not caring.  No matter how ill treated I feel about what you've done to me recently does not change the fact that I once called you friend, and two of the dearest to me in the game, and for that I respect it, so I wont run around lying to people, I'll just tell them what happened and that I'm very annoyed and slightly hurt by it.<br>
<br>
All I've seen from both of you so far is snidey little remarks of &quot;your bad conduct&quot; and threats to &quot;publicly descrace me&quot; and the thing that made me take up the arguement fully was sages &quot;your bridges are now burnt&quot; I wont let the 2 of you look down your noses at me and make snipy little belitting comments at me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usiilverain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siilverain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Wind Caller</span><br>  Posts: 410<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/28/01 5:52:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Suggestion</span><hr size=1> Suggestion_01 says,<br>
<br>
Leader who is interested in running VS raid expresses interest no later than <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 10 days</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> prior to expected pickup rotation spawn. This can be done either via email with interested raid leaders or via Emarr Boards D&amp;P.  Given no issue with other leaders, the initial leader would plan and execute raid.  If there is an issue with another raid leader, the leaders in question would be expected to work out an agreement.  If no agreement is reached, that particular VS spawn becomes FFA to whatever leader can mobilize forces first. <br>
<br>
I believe this would be the most effecient personally.  10 days prior to VS spawn would give all interested leaders a chance to respond &amp; discuss the upcoming spot.  My preference is to discuss via emails as not everyone has 24/7 access to the boards. This I speak from personal experience....  As I've expressed before, I'm open to further suggestions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usagemonprayeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sagemon Prayeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/28/01 8:23:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suggestion</span><hr size=1> Gorn, you still have your panties in a wad about my use of the word &quot;cronies&quot; eight or nine months ago?

<br>
Kieara, I'm impressed with your ability to draw conclusions about people you've never met.  However, this statement caught my eye:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They accuse people of stuff that doesn't happen, then when someone who was there and knows it didn't comes to refute their accusation they make excuses instead of appologizing (see Valric thread).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What in the world are you talking about?  I have no recollection of anyone disputing any of the factual statements that I made in that thread.  Gorndax disagreed with my opinions, but no one denied that things happened pretty much the way I said they did.<br>
<br>
This statement also caught my attention:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have no idea what happen between Submina and Torm but honestly I would believe Submina, because she is my friend, and I dont believe she would lie to me. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sadly, I know exactly where you're coming from there.  Torm and I did the same thing with respect to all of Submina's prior troubles on raids.  We believed her because she was our friend.  Now, I really wonder about all of those prior blowups. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>
