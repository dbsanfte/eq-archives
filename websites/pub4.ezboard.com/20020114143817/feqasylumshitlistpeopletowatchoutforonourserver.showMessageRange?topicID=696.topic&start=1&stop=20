We are derailing trains that are constantly being pulled to the zone. No biggie, same shit different day. Miramicha calls the tower on camp check yet he and a few others keep running to the zone pulling trains. They dont come back, we call camp check, tower is not called. We take the tower. Sounds simple so far yes? Well...... this guy has the nerve to come up to the tower saying we &quot;took his camp!&quot; ( yet there was nobody up there ) so we tell him sorry - you can't call the camp if #1 YOU AREN'T HERE! #2 Training everything to the zone every few minutes is not &quot;camping&quot;. He gets all pissed off and threatens to train us!<br>
<br>
[Thu Nov 08 23:52:34 2001] You say, 'how dare you threaten to train us' <br>
[Thu Nov 08 23:52:59 2001] Miramicha says, 'i am saying, you think its fair to take this over when it has been called?' <br>

[Thu Nov 08 23:53:34 2001] Miramicha says, 'i will bring basement here' <br>
<br>
 I couldn't believe it! Then he has the balls to actually do it! He died in the process ( LOSER ) even though I didn't ( cause he is a LOSER ) <br>
<br>
Lucky for us we had a Lv 60 cleric tagging along with us so the others that he killed got the best rezzes. I logged all the text and yes - this idiot actually said the following:<br>
<br>
[Fri Nov 09 00:12:46 2001] Miramicha says, 'i trained you, and expected to die' <br>

However, what he was doing was just trying to get the Captian but could not hold the camp. This went on for over an hour. They had been gone for over half an hour. We went up to the tower after the whole place had respawned. How long are we supposed to wait? Is there a time line I should be aware of? <br>

<br>
A group will assemble at the entrance and call a camp maybe even if they cant hold it but just the fact that its an open camp and people respect the fact that if you call something its yours.  So they will either try to break in and ussually train to zone OVER and OVER again.  Now as far as Verant states, if you leave the zone for ANY reason your claim to that spot is gone.  <br>
<br>
Now in defense of this whole &quot;pulling mobs to the zone is a good way to break camp&quot;.  Very true but you can single pull Tower to the entrance generally if you dont have any pops on the way down, so zoning is just some bullshit excuse to have someone else do your dirty work, Noni was in the right Miramicha was in the wrong, enough said. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utellwar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TellWar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/12/01 7:35:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TRAINED by Miramicha</span><hr size=1> Karnor's is a terrible place, I have seen camp calling more than a few times by peeps  at the zone line begging others to join.<br>
My own experience was that someone was calling tower and didn't even have a group, we moved there and held it.<br>
As far as training someone goes, that is bullshit... If they were zoning every few mins to break the spawn in the tower, then they didn't have the camp to begin with...<br>
So yeah Miramicha was definately in the wrong on this. <p>Tell Lespartan<br>

Is that how folks break the tower camp now a days?  Granted it been about a year since I spent any amount of time in KC.  But I sure things cann't have changed to much.  I see derailing trains at the zone is still a good way to get pulls.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I never remember breaking the camp by watching our puller pull everything there to the zone.  What I remember the pullers doing is pull mob to group.  Group kill critter.  Group move up a little more to next spot.  Puller goes and gets next critter.  Until we reach the bottom of the stairs.  The final critters at the top of the stairs were not pulled.  The group rushed them.  There only 2 or 3 up there in argo range and noone should be trying to break tower without CC high enough to mez all the critters. <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br><b>

You made it sound like only the good players make it to Velks.....so what happens to the idiots?<br>
<br>
Our server has actually gotten too crowded in my opinion and it leads to alot of these camp calling problems. I once had someone insist that I stole their camp. <br>
I responded with &quot;huh? my friend an I have been here for 15-20 minutes and we've cleared the whole thing in that time. Nobody was here in all that time and not one mob had been touched before we got here&quot;<br>
He claimed that his group was planning to do the camp and were waiting for members to show up before coming to the camp. (they were not waiting anywhere in sight of the camp , altho he claimed to be nearby. Of course he never opened his mouth about it until we had cleared the whole thing.<br>
<br>
This loser gave me a bunch of verbal shit for 20 minutes and his entire group tried to KS us the whole time we were there.<br>
<br>
If i am at a camp that I can see was recently inhabited and a person runs up claiming it ...I give them the benefit of the doubt and give it back. People who claim camps simply because they were dreaming about it before I got there is another matter tho lol.<br>
<br>
I have even had people run up to my camp and claim that because I never answered their camp check that they have a right to the camp. This one really cracks me up. I can't even respond sometimes because I am laughing so hard at the fool. <p><img src="http://server38.hypermart.net/danii1/Tiger2.GIF"><br>    <img src="http://server38.hypermart.net/danii1/TigerJump.GIF">    <a href="http://www.nemesisfury.com/" target="_blank">        </b><br>Roguish Nymph<br> Officer Nemesis Fury</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzxing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zxing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/12/01 9:08:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TRAINED by Miramicha</span><hr size=1> I used to pull tower to zone to break it...but wtf man, I would at MOST get double pulls.

We grouped with this guy the night before in KC at the left moat and he seemed like a really nice guy. I am sure he is. People have bad days/nights - whatever. My issue and the reason for the posting on this Shit List is because first he threatened to trains us with the intent to kill our group, then he trained us and then told us he did it on purpose. So, if you play with this guy ( who is not in a guild btw ) And he does not get his way or feels he has been wronged - This is what you can expect in return. There is no excuse and this is not how I expect High Level people to play. He should be ashamed. I bet some of you know the people he got killed and know that they are GOOD players and well respected. They are:<br>
<br>
Mistresseliz Lv 54 Druid - She got killed twice. Once from the original train in the tower and the second time just after she was rezzed and Miramicha went back up to drag his body out of the tower bringing everything back to zone with him.<br>
<br>
Fernassassin Lv 52 Monk <br>
<br>
Wrethard Lv 51 Cleric<br>
<br>
I also want to note - the other people in his group ( if he was still in a group ) never said a word or came up to the tower. I don't think they even knew what he was doing.<br>
<br>
His actions are cause to be banned. I have emailed the text log and a screen shot to VI on Friday and I am just waiting for a response. There is nothing that justifies what he did. Trains happen and people die all the time - That is NOT what happened here. <br>

We had a nice group, and had been pulling the tower for 1-2 hours when we got a nasty train. I don't know who trained us, it does not really matter, these things happen in KC all the time. I do know I got killed in it. I got a res pretty quick. After I had been rebuffed, and while the group was medding up, I went back to work on the tower to keep it broke.<br>
<br>
I was pulling mostly 1 at a time, but on one pull I was doing, someone came out from courtyards with a small train, and that caused some problems at the zone. <br>
<br>
I never seen these others call for a camp check, maybe they did that when we had to zone out from a train. I do remember them saying they were claiming the tower. Which I could not understand, as they had never asked if it was camped, I informed them it was taken already. <br>
<br>
My last pull out of the tower was just 3 dawgs, which we handled with no problem. We had a very good group that night. <br>
<br>
As to the steady trains to the zone? I never had a train to the zone while breaking the tower, I did have lots of pulls, and I did encouter someone elses train from the courtyards. I don't know how you all do it, but when breaking a camp in the front part of KC, it is standard procedure to pull to the zone. <br>
I finish breaking the tower, and go up and find all these fools sitting in it. I asked them why they were taking our camp over, and they told me there was no one here, so they were claiming it. <br>
<br>
I never knew that the drolvarg captain was up at that time, in fact, I never seen it once that night. I would never pull the entire tower to the zone to get the captain. Is this why you wanted the tower so badly? Because you seen that the captain was up? Maybe you had wanted the captain to your selves.<br>
<br>
One thing I do know, just because a group has to zone due to being trained does not mean they have given up the camp they were holding. If this was the case, people would be training all the time to get the camp they want. So what right did you have to ruin a good time we were having that night?<br>

I did say I was going to train you, but it was never my intention to do it. And I do appologize for that as well. I have never trained anyone before on purpose, I play this game to have fun. Since this incident, some members of your guild have trained me on purpose, and interfered with groups I was in, which I find just as wrong as the other night. <br>

I'm not saying that anyone would intentually make up a text, but I am just trying to make a point. Just because something is written black and white doesn't make it true. The bottom line is that there will always be two sides to the same story especially in situations like this. I hope that the partys involved can just find it within themselves to say that their tempers got the best of them and that they are sorry. Also, I hope that noone is offended by me mentioning their name in above text. <p>Grandmaster Fyst

Training someone is no excuse.  <br>
<br>
Some people respect your &quot;claim&quot; to a camp if you've been trained out, but they're not obligated to.  The way I see it, if you're not there--at the camp site--then it's not your camp.  If someone chooses to move into the camp while you're gone, consider it tough luck, and move on. <p><IMG SRC="http://home.swbell.net/sdspies/images/mustelasig.jpg" BORDER="0" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="212" alt="Image courtesy The Ferret Company http://www.ferretcompany.com/"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umustelafuro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mustela Furo</A> at: 11/13/01 4:39:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udarkomen42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOmen42</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/13/01 5:24:47 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/37/1570037.gif?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TRAINED by Miramicha</span><hr size=1> It looks to me as if Mir was at the camp, and was making pulls from it when the other group walked in and sat down. <p><a href="http://www.oboo.org" border=0><img src="http://darkomen42.freeservers.com/harabec1.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubouldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bouldor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(11/13/01 8:18:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TRAINED by Miramicha</span><hr size=1> I have encountered Miramacha over the levels in various places and have found him to be a decent guy.<br>
<br>
This sounds like a misunderstanding...and perhaps a crime of passion. One thing is for sure, jumping someone's camp is highly likely to cause an angry response from the group you are trying to strong-arm.<br>
<br>
You should respect their camp (per the unwritten rules of the Lanys community). If you did not know it was their camp, then once you do finally learn it was theirs, do the right thing and back off..<br>
<br>
Training is clearly wrong, I can see where it came from in this case..I have had people jump camps on me and it is absolutely infuriating..<br>
<br>
Good luck getting Miramacha banned..However, I bet he lasts longer than your surname, Ms. Deecups.<br>
