As you stated, 2 SEPERATE camps...so what Domestic did was CAMP steal not KILL steal. They were fine pulling their room, Domestic was the one who couldn't maintain his satisfaction level.  He was asked not to do it but chose to ignore it, so then when it was done to him, he said he would retaliate...you can't have your cake and eat it too. Sorry.<br>
<br>
As far as what Poopuu's group did, he admitted it wasn't the proper thing to do. However, if Domestic was SOLO in the Lookout room and still pulling from the Guard room I'm quite sure death was not imminent for him. Thus considering he didn't die, yours is once again a moot point. Not the brightest move to make, but it did make a point. <br>
<br>
As far as the naming conventions, that isn't the reason this was posted, and whether or not you take someone seriously based on a name is pretty irrelevant. I would recommend to stay on topic.<br>
<br>
As Poopuu is a fellow guildmate, I have hunted with him on numerous occasions and know that this action was not taken lightly. He is not thin-skinned nor oversensitive, so in my own experience this means that this conduct exhibited by Domestic was WAY outta bounds. <br>
<br>
Makes me wonder why some attack those that post, rather than READING what was posted. This List is for posting problems just like this...and he did break VI's rules with the language issue in the tantrums he threw. Two wrongs may not make a right, however this individual deserves this one IMO. <p>Alganorn Redthorn <BR>

I did.<br>
<br>
I have hunted with a couple of characters in HHP. I've spent a good deal of time in both the guard room and the lookout room. While camping the lookout room, I've pulled mobs from the guard room that were unengaged. I've never had a group in the guard room take issue with me over that. Then again, I'm also certain not to be overly greedy. <br>
<br>
Poopuu (which is still a moronic name) and his group were completely and totally out of line in their response to the situation. They escalated it, instead of trying to resolve it.<br>
<br>
Your guildmate is not entirely without fault. In fact, this whole situation might have been avoided if he had acted like an adult and tried to work the situation out, instead of responding in what was a very childlike fashion.<br>
<br>
EDIT: One more thing: I fail to see where Domestic/Soulcollector used any foul or insulting language. Regardless, cursing or insulting is not shitlistable. Camp stealing is, but the poster of this is just as guilty as Domestic is.<br>
<br>
This isn't shitlistable. At best it is a rant, and should be moved. <p><center><b>Tyral the Kithless - Guildmaster of Nyaa!</b></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utyralthekithless.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyral the Kithless</A> at: 1/8/02 3:59:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukayshasoulsinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaysha Soulsinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/8/02 6:25:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=737.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulcollector aka Domestic</span><hr size=1> Sorry, Tyral, but if you have read the first message then you apparently didn't understand it completely.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1. The Lookout Room is considered a separate camp. It sounds as if you guys had an issue with the fact that he chose to take it, thus depriving you of two more mobs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You insinuate that they took MoBs from the Lookout Room, and didn't agree with the other person to let them be for Domestic. If you understand Poopuu's (agreed, the name appears ... unfitting. However, he is a Shadowknight, and if he is a Troll, it might be fitting) first message, he wrote that they were in Guard Room, and only fighting the MoBs there. Not taking any from Lookout UNTIL Domestic started pulled from Guard. Only then did they start pulling from Lookout. If Domestic had not made the Guard pulls, the conflict would have never occured.<br>
<br>
In itself this is a bit weird - it means that MoBs were up in Lookout, while Domestic was pulling from Guard. Odd to say the least, if Domestic was supposed to be in Lookout ... details lacking here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2. You guys blocked him into the room. How cute. You realize if he tried to escape to the guards because the mob was kicking his ass that you would be guilty of causing XP loss?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Read Kenlail's message. Understand it while you are at it. But agreed, two wrongs don't make a right.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Obviously your group was busy with another mob or you would have pulled the mob before he saw it. It doesn't matter anyways, because you didn't engage it, therefore it wasn't a KS.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Pathing sucks. Agro sucks. Blame Verant, not the group.<br>

<br>
You are contradicting yourself here. Domestic/Soulcollector is accused of camp-stealing by Poopuu, which is shitlistable and therefore it's posted here. In other words, not a rant. Whether or not Poopuu and his group are guilty of the same is absolutely irrelevant. <p><br><A Href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=30878"><IMG
