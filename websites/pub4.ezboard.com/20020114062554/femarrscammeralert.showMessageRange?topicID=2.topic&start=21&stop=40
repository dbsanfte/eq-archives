You all might want to have a chat with him, those of you who have never had trouble with him, as this is all BS. Or at least it started as it, he never stole Dambala's manastone, Dambala is just pissed at him from waaaaaaay back when while Misty was camping a few gnome guards and wouldn't let Dam take one. Or so his story goes, and according to a friend of mine who's also a RL friend of Misty, well this shit is all made up. Misty wasn't training in Karnor's, you guys were pulling onto him, so he brought it back to your asses, bottom line. He was exploring that night and you kept running pulls near him, so instead sitting there to die he assisted you in pulling them to the fooking group.<br>

That's all I have to say about it. <p><img src="http://www.darkfleet.com/signature.gif" height=106 width=298>

Antilles, it seems as though someone is blatantly lying here.. either Misty or Dambala. Now I'm not going to point fingers about who did what cause I don't know shit. But anyway you look at it,  it's pretty freaking sad that someone (Misty or Dambala) would fabricate stuff  about someone else. You'd think that the people who play this game, especially the higher levels would have the personal integrity to at least not MAKE STUFF UP about other people.<br>

Misty can seem like a nice guy very easily as he was friends with a Druid in our guild. His treachery is not apparent til motivated by greed, a lesson I hope you dont have to learn. This druid gave a set of GE boots and one other item to Misty to hold for his main character. Misty promptly logged and denied for quite a while that this ever happened despite our druid's logs etc. Another guildmate has logs of him ADMITTING that he took the boots and I am sure if it is necessary I can get him to pos those here. Our druid, as well as others who have dealt with this fellow have been victimized for very good pieces of equipment. This fellow has been reported multiple times for similiar actions but no sanction has been placed against him and since most people on the server dont read this board, he will likely dupe some other person into trusting him. Then he will screw them too.<br>
<br>
One person I might be able to accept as a grudge. Not multiple, and not when I was logged on and watching the Guildsay as he stole the boots. Yes, I was on when it happened and I know the anger that went through our druid at his loss. <br>
<br>
In the end, Mistywolf is a thief of the lowest kind, one who you call friend until through your trust he can place the knife deeply in your back. <p>I'm sorry, I don't have a k3wl signature.<br>

Right now to clear everything up, I am on nobody's side. Haven't had problems with Misty other than him wanting to trade accounts, which really wasn't a problem, and though I find it hard to believe so many people have been stupid (pardon me, no offense meant) to fall for this if its true, though I also find it hard to believe Misty's story of Dambala making this crap up. The earlier post of me ranting on and on, well that was me pissed off for some reason and just blowing steam, though not much. I'm going to refer Seek, the leader of the Guard to this board and let him deal with this however he chooses. It would help if any of you had any evidence of this though, I mean we all know if you want to lie its not that hard to pull it off, especially on the net :P<br>

   now yeah i may just be too trusting, and therefore a perfect target for such an act of thievery, but i am not a liar, and not especially a liar about events that took place in a video game, one that i don;t actually get the urge to play much anymore, so why would i take the time to make up an elaborate story bagging on this supposedly innocent guy that sooo many other people have had the displeasure of meeting and getting ripped off by? what could i possibly stand to gain from any of this?......<br>
   nothing. all that matters to me is that this guy is prevented from screwing over any other unassuming people out there, and as for my credibility and additude towards people in game, i have never had a problem with anyone else since last may when i started playing, but, as Misty is an extremely talented liar, i can see how you would be fooled by him too Antilles. How much do i post here? How many people have i flamed, how many arguments have i jumped in on? none, im just a quiet, easygoing guy, i read these boards often and see no reason to comment on anything unless it involves me, and the situation with the manastone really did occur and i do not doubt for a second anyone else that says they got scammed by him too, some people are just plain old bastards, Mistywolf is a perfect example.<br>
  Now, i dont know if this following log means much since i started it at the end of our conversation, but this is the same conversation in which Misty told me that he had bought the account and that he wasn;t the same person, so if you have talked to him at any time since that day, you will now see how blatantly he can lie...<br>

<br>
  the 12 year old kid he is referring to is the &quot;old&quot; Misty, part of his story was telling me how he emailed him asking for a refund after finding out how bad his reputation was, the &quot;old&quot; Misty emailed him back telling him to F**k off because it was too late...so i guess the whole point of this long winded post is to say that mistywolf is a lying doo doo head.<br>
so there.<br>
<br>
ps. sorry for lack of punctuation/good sentence structure or whatever, it's pretty late to care about that stuff and my cat continually struts across my keyboard messing me up<br>

Ill add my complaint again, since this board is for that specifically.<br>
<br>
Long long time ago:<br>
<br>
Mistywolf KSes from my group at the icy orcs in everfrost. We then start to pay attention and make sure he doesnt get any more kills from us. So what does he do? Runs to perma and trains an ice giant on us. It doesnt work. He then charms a wooly mammoth and tries to KS that way. Finally he gives up and goes on his way. <p><IMG SRC="http://fareal.com/Destian.png">

He tried to scam but as I have never been real big on druids no offense to my good druid friends I didn't bite nor did I entertain any notions of a trade. Eventually I put him on ignore because he wouldn't stop harassing me with his sob story that he needed a fbss. He along with Ridas where the two druids I hated the most simply because they had no morals. Mistywolf has scammed quite a few people. AS for Antilles a scammers most important ability is to appear very nice and pleasant so you begin to trust them. Then bam they scam you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhorrashalfpine.showPublicProfile>Horras Halfpine</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/00 11:29:31 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~darkdragoon/horraspic.jpg height=224 width=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mistywolf closer to being banned</span><hr size=1> ahhh, finally found this freakin board, Chuk's been tellin me about this thing for a while now.<br>
<br>
Well it's all true, I did get my GE Boots and Molten Cloak stolen off me by Mistywolf... it took 3 weeks for anyone to do anything about it.<br>
<br>
I had talked to the GM of the server that whole time and all she kept telling me was &quot; I need to look into it further &quot; blah blah blah... so finally 3 weeks later, there comes a GM online that goes around checking all the servers.  He actually DOES something about it, cause me and kazuma had man logs of him addmiting to the theft of my stuff.  He suspended Mistywolf (I was pissed that he didn't get banned, but still good enough).<br>
<br>
Anyways this prick is still on the server, yes he WAS in Stone Guard, but I finally got a few friends to talk to Seek and they rightfully booted him *cheers*. <p>Horras Halfpine<br>
