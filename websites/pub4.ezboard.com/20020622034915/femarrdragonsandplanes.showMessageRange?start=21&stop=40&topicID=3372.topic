&gt; My original post was not directed at any specific event or person<br>
consistant with this<br>
&gt; It would irritate Raedwulf and the other guy because they hate when I am right<br>
<br>
Oh, sure, you can claim that you were simply mentioning them rather than directing your comments at them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, now to your main point.<br>
&gt; If I were to find a post, that proved beyond question that everything<br>
&gt; I had ever claimed on this board was true, what effect would it have?<br>
<br>
Your hypotesis is flawed.<br>
<br>
I'll quote Ice:<br>
<br>
&gt;You claim everyone else trains people out of spite.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but I've never trained anyone out of spite. If you were to prove without a doubt that every OTHER person trains people out of spite, I'd be incredibly disappointed. I have a great many friends in this game who I don't believe would to this, and it would be incredibly disheartening to be proved wrong.<br>
<br>
&gt; You claim women who dress nicely are using sexual appeal to torture men<br>
&gt; or for some sick self-gratifying ego-boost.<br>
<br>
If this claim, and most of your other misogynistic drivel were proved true umm... sorry.. it's just really hard to try to imagine a world which is as twisted as imaginary the one you've created for yourself... well.. I guess I'd be really wondering how the human species were to proporgate for another generation.<br>

It is shaped by the views of everyone involved. That is why for every event there will never be an exact retelling of said event because each individual will remember the details differently. <br>
<br>
The reason that no one cares as you say it is due to the fact that people do not like to be continually bashed over the head with the same question nor do they want to hear someone saying this is the truth. Aside from true empiricism which is normally a quantitve symbolism nothing can be shown to be &quot;true&quot; because you cannot isolate said events in a vaccuum free from bias, limited, erroneous interpretation, and the the possible variables that can effect the retelling/explanation of an event/story.  Your primary failure lies within the simple phrase &quot;to err is human&quot;. Everyone looks at something with completely different viewpoints hence the word perspective. <br>
<br>
Man has been searching for &quot;truth&quot; since his origin.Yet he will never find truth? Why? It's a crusade for a non-tangible ideal of nothing. Truth of what? God, man's existance, what exactly are you looking for?<br>
<br>
It is intellectually dishonest to suggest that you know the truth, because that is a physcial impossbility because no such thing exists because no paramaters have been set. Even if there were parameters you could set enough of them to state the &quot;truth&quot; (Empirical date notwithstanding). <br>

<br>
I don't like lying - I prefer using the truth to get things done, and if you don't believe me, I have people who can vouch for me (yes, even <i>monks</i>). &nbsp;When someone shows me evidence that I'm wrong about something, I accept it. &nbsp;I don't call the person a sheep, a bottom-feeder, or a wannabe. &nbsp;I won't say I don't stoop to namecalling, because honestly, it's fun at times. &nbsp;I just won't make an unsubstantiated claim about someone (I'll call you delusional, but I won't say you're a Gopher wannabe).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your not a peer unless I agree you are. ... To be a peer, you must tell the 'whole' truth and not just the parts you want to make your points.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In going along the lines of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> true</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> definition, a peer is someone of equal standing with another in a group.  We are all of equal standing here on the message board (we all signed up the same way, we all have the same posting rights), save the admins of course, so don't go pulling this &quot;I don't have to explain this to you because you aren't equal to me&quot; crap.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I'm just plain disgusted by your lack of consideration for ANY opinion other than your own.  Your self-serving crusade's only beating a dead horse these days, yet you still insist you are right and we are wrong... <br>
<br>
By the way, before you go saying that I'm a sheep or some other predictable response to say my post means nothing (cause I know you will), feel free to take a long look at yourself in the mirror and ask: &quot;Am I an admin of this board?&quot;, &quot;Do I have some power over the other persons on this message board that automatically makes me right and them wrong?&quot;.  If you can answer yes to both of these questions, I can only assume you've been doing drugs again, cause the obvious answers are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NO!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>

Therefore, you may well choose to argue with them in the hope of 'learning'<br>
or 'exploring' an issue.<br>
<br>
That isnt what is happening here. For example in NO post anywhere did I say<br>
'a very close friend of you gave me personal information about you'<br>
YET, that is exactly what 'Ice' would have you believe I have said. That is not true.<br>
You see not even VENDRIX claims everything I say on certain topics is invalid,<br>
he just thinks its amusing that I care. Ice would have you believe that unless<br>
you 'prove' something (that of course means to 'his' satisfaction) that it isnt true.<br>
No 'Ice' it means 'YOU' wont accept it as true. Not the same thing.<br>
<br>
I am not interested in you little parsing games. That is why I wont explain things to you. You ARE dishonest and I know you are, and so do you. Anytime you comment on a topic where the 'conclusion' YOU portray is contrary to the observed<br>
facts that anyone else has seen, you just proved you were dishonest to them also.<br>
I have no doubt whatsoever that you have given yourself away to many people,<br>
no they wont come here and support me, likely because they dislike me more than you. But they are still aware of what you are doing. You demand 'proof' of you being dishonest and then turn around and preclude 'any' proof as sufficient.<br>
These little mind games 'may' impress 'you' but they dont 'me' and frankly<br>
I doubt they impress as many people as you think. Yours is the arrogance of intelligent youth. You think you cant get caught. Well you go one and believe that.<br>
<br>
Listening to you is like listening to a 'Goodfellow' demanding proof. I am not a cop<br>
or a jurist, I dont need 'your' standard of proof. <br>

I will admit you get baited alot on these boards, but damnit man, admit when you are wrong once in a while and im sure you would gain a hell of alot more respect than you do now.  And if you feel you are above debating with people on these boards, then why post at all?  Simply to get a rise?  That means you are no better than Dwarkarn.

I refer you to the DAOC forum of this board and suggest you look under<br>
'Apology to Celdor'<br>
<br>
Celdor is hardly one of my fans.<br>
<br>
It isnt possible to 'prove' anything to someone who doesnt wish to see the proof.<br>
To 'try' to 'prove' anything to the likes of 'Ice' is simple folly. He just wants to show off. I am not impressed with his stunts. To continue to joust with him<br>
'implies' that his argument has some type of credence' If I dont see it that way,<br>
why bother doing that? As I said in my first post on this thread, <br>
<br>
Even if I proved to EVERYONES standards that everything I have ever said<br>
on the board was gospel, it would have NO impact whatever. None.<br>
<br>
So why validate 'Ice'? That means I am willing to play 'his' game. I am not.<br>
And I am also doing him the 'courtesy' of telling him I wont.<br>
As I have said before, if you want my participation, we do it 'my' way.<br>
I dont need Ice's participation. His absence wont even be noticed.<br>

You've learned from the master dodger well.  Good job at ignoring most of my post, and just responding to a single line.  Way to go on Out-Of-Context 101!  I give you an A-.<br>
<br>
There's nothing within my post that could possibly demonstrate anything like your &quot;semantic logic&quot; conclusion.  [Did you read the college course catalog again?]  In any event, of course I think my opinions are right, and those of yours that disagree with mine, wrong.  That's pretty much a given regarding anyone.  You have asserted the same position, Mushroom Boy, so you clearly do agree with it (just with the subject of the pronouns changed).  Validity isn't the question.<br>
<br>
I could try and explain the difference between facts and opinions to you, but you clearly aren't going to try and comprehend these things.  Suffice it to say that I don't think you can prove my opinions wrong, and I can't prove yours wrong either.  You have your opinions and I have mine.  I can demonstrate that some of your facts might be in error or that you are ignoring certain facts in an effort to get you to change your opinions/conclusions, but I can't prove an opinion wrong.  I can hold the opinion that your conclusion is wrong, but I can't prove it.  Neither can you.<br>

He doesn't speak the same language we do!<br>
<br>
Even simple terms, he gets wrong (like in an earlier thread where he didn't understand the term &quot;fanatic&quot;).  In this case, he doesn't understand the meaning of the word &quot;peer.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In common parlance 'peer' means someone whos opinion you respect.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
<br>
BZZZZZT!<br>
<br>
Peer has nothing to do with respect.  The dictionary definition is:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A person who has equal standing with another or others, as in ran<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1 : one that is of equal standing with another : EQUAL; especially : one belonging to the same societal group especially based on age, grade, or status<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As individuals who play the same computer game, we are all peers.   I don't have to respect you, but in this game, you are my peer.<br>
<br>
So, I think this point illustrates a typical frustration experienced when attempting to converse with Chiteng (and I'm sure his frustrations when he attempts to talk to us!) he has a poor vocabulary and has no idea that he frequently uses words incorrectly or assigns them an invalid meaning.<br>
<br>
What we really need is a Chiteng to English dictionary in order to get our point across using words incorrectly so he can understand us.<br>
