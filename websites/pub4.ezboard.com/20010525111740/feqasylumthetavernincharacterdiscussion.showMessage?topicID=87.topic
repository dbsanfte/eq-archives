She is a Halfling that you are rumored to be acquainted with. I have come to tell you her story, as we have not seen her in an age now, and we are worried about her safety. Perhaps in return for this bit of history that I have come to offer to you…you could tell me something of her present whereabouts?<br>
<br>
Now I will only tell you all of this because as I hear it, you are her friends….but please do not let on that you have heard any tales from me, indeed, it would cause her great embarrassment, yes it would.<br>
<br>
As you may know, we pride ourselves in Rivervale for turning out more druids on the continent of Antonica than any other city. It is a normal thing for our children to grow up schooled in the druidic ways, what with all the forest we have, the rolling hills and all the animals living so close to town. But Saippenu did not….. ahem, well she did not fit in with the other children of Rivervale. You see, Saipp was afraid of the animals and if the truth be told…..she was very afraid of the dark! Oh she tried….yes she did. Many’s the night I saw her run by our hole in a fit of fear, tears streaming down her face, with some animal or another nipping at her arse because it sensed her fear and decided to take advantage.<br>
<br>
  It was very sad to watch her struggles, very sad indeed. Most of our young ones were so very independent…..always out charming the animals, romping in the hills by day and even during the night. It is not uncommon for our children to spend much of their time alone and without fear of anything in the woods….but not so for our little Saipp. &lt;sigh&gt;<br>
<br>
Oh, and please do not ever let on that you know about the fear of darkness thing…..but be aware that you should not leave her alone in the night .…the poor dear is terrified by the mere sight of the moon looming overhead. We worry so for her safety…..how will she manage out in the big world, when merely coping with life at home was such a burden for her?<br>
<br>
Now where was I? Oh yes…..and so it went for many years…laughed at by the other children, and fearing that the adults viewed her as somewhat “inferior”, little Saipp became sullen, often sulking alone in her room, reading (of all things) silly books about whole groups of people who traveled the world, adventuring together like a pack of wolves. We do not condone such behavior in our children. There is nothing beyond our own forests that needs discovering, and to waste time on such idle dreams is ……well…it is to be discouraged is all I will say on that.<br>
<br>
  And so it was bound to happen I suppose. One day in late autumn, with skies as bright as the bark of a firebeetle tree, a stranger passed through Rivervale. <br>
 She was bad news I tell you…..a ranger by profession as I recall. You could see it in the stride that she bore, the bow carried loosely over her shoulder and the travels worn into her boots, that this was no ordinary tourist, no she was not.<br>
 We Halflings can smell trouble from far off …... not that it would require a sensitive nose in this case, since this one still wreaked with the stench of the High Pass gnolls.<br>
<br>
 The adults in town offered the stranger no more than a passing nod and most of our children know enough to keep their distance from the foreigners who occasionally pass through on their way to Kithicor (especially the big folks….big folks are trouble I tell you !) ….. but Saippenu was spellbound by this particular traveler (no doubt the product of reading too much nonsense about such people in her silly books).<br>
<br>
I myself ran to Saipp’s family burrow and warned her relations that Saipp had been seen in conversation with the stranger on the commons, but her family laughed at the notion that Saipp might ever be brave enough to get herself into trouble on any account.<br>
<br>
So there they sat, the mysterious ranger and our own Saippenu, eye to eye by the fire. (We always have a fire burning on the town commons once the fall season arrives).<br>
<br>
 As early afternoon passed into late evening, the stranger rattled on about some adventure or another…..and Saipp sat there spellbound…..not even noticing that night had wrapped around them like a blanket of smothering black smoke.<br>
 Finally, after many hours of story telling, the stranger let go of her grip on Saippenu’s imagination, and off she went into the night, as unremarkably as she had appeared in the first place.<br>
<br>
 The weeks followed in their usual uneventful style, one after another (as they often do in these parts) until one day, as if fate had simply wanted it to be so, the ranger returned.<br>
<br>
 Limping slowly up the old dirt path that leads to Rivervale the beleaguered traveler, who appeared to be suffering from mortal injuries, stumbled and fell at the entrance to town. <br>
<br>
 The community’s entire population rushed out to see what all the murmurings were about (Rivervale’s rumor mill is nothing if not efficient) and there they stood at the edge of our Halfling haven, their eyes full of shock and horror at the sight of the ranger lady……on her knees, bleeding everywhere….one hand clutched to her chest, the other held out in a gesture of pleading desperation. <br>
<br>
<br>
Horrible it was to see I tell you. I  shudder to this day whenever I think of it.<br>
 There was nothing we could do for this poor lass. Although we Halfings have some renowned skill for the healing arts…. our druids tried of course, yes they did….but their healing powers were of no match for wounds such as these, no they were not. <br>
<br>
So there the ranger lady knelt, in such pain and agony as we have ever seen, when all of the sudden, Saippenu rushes out of town…..all out of breath and eyes darting around crazily like water spiders in a windstorm. She stood in front of the ranger lady with the most forlorn look wrinkling and distorting her fair Halfling face.<br>
  Her fat little fists were clenched tight with anger, her forehead was lined with grooves as deep as any furrow in our fields, and then, to all our amazement,  Saippenu appeared to be sucking all the air out of the nearby forest and held it in her lungs for what seemed like an eternity. Blue she turned I tell you …positively blue! Her chubby little arms began waving about madly in the air….she looked like a windmill that had been seized by a wizard’s gust of air spell….and turning bluer by the moment I tell you ! We feared she might explode! It was a terrifying spectacle to behold, yes it was.<br>
<br>
And then, just as we were sure that Saippenu would drop to the ground (as dead as the ranger lady would surely soon be), Saipp let go of that big breath she had been holding for so long. Her arms stopped flailing and pointed straight at the dying ranger lady’s head and she blew out a great gust of blue air that rushed around the lady like a swarm of angry bees. Angry blue bees….can you imagine!  So hard did Saipp blow on the lady that the currents made by her tremendous exhale bent the trees all around us ! <br>
 It was magic such as we have never seen. Yes it was. There were no Halfling children throwing cruel javelins of jest at Saippenu that day I will tell you….no indeed there were not. The whole crowd of Halfling onlookers backed away from Saippenu (and the now fully healed ranger lady) in a united display of awe.<br>
<br>
Well, I need not tell you what happened next, as I am sure that you have already guessed. <br>
 The Ranger lady stood and embraced Saippenu long and hard. Tho we could not hear what the stranger was saying, Saippenu was listening most intently to every word.<br>
<br>
  Eventually their embrace came to an end, and Saipp slowly turned to face the Halfling crowd, a mob who’s only features appeared to be saucer sized eyes and gaping mouths …(it is a most undignified look I can tell you).<br>
<br>
Blinking humbly into the crowd of onlookers, Saippenu stuttered for a bit, then stammered even longer, and finally managed a little croak of a voice: “ I must go now my friends, we have much to do, this ranger lady and I. Yes we do. Very busy I will be, but no time to talk of it now……”<br>
And with just those few words, she waved to the crowd and scurried off, trying to keep pace with the ranger lady, who was by now halfway across the forest that surrounds Rivervale.<br>
<br>
So you see, the Ranger lady took our most talented Saippenu away that day. Yes she did. For many years our young druids anxiously awaited Saipp’s return, in the hope of learning how to blow the healing blue bees on people….but alas, it did not come to pass.<br>
<br>
 So if you see our long lost child of Rivervale, please tell her Hullo for all of us<br>
……oh….. and tell her that we ALWAYS loved her…..even before she blew blue bees on the ranger lady. We are just a teasing kind…it is not meant to hurt…all in fun you know.<br>
<br>
Burrbold waves to you all. “Thank you for listening…and please give her our message”<br>
