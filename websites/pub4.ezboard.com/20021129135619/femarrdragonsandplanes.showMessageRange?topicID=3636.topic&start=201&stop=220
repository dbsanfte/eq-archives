The fact that you mis-represent that dissappoints me. I didnt think you were a liar. I did make a post<br>
where I asked Stratiss and Donetello where I should START working on my epic.<br>
Asking two fellow monks for advice is hardly a sin. Yes you are correct in that<br>
you were not guild leader of DB. I had honestly forgotten Cuchulin. But you do prove that you did know who I was, and what I was. I have copies of almost all<br>
of our e-mails. In NONE of them do you state that the 'reason' is me posting<br>
on this board. In ONE of them you do tell me to stop. You didnt bother telling the readers that I did stop. Thank you for addmitting the duality of your policys.<br>
Good for one person, ignored on another. By  the terms of the merger I was addmitted as a full member. Every surviving member of AoR knows it. Thats means I expect to be treated as one. Not a recruit, or probationary. Thank you for addmitting you feel free to change the terms of the merger at will. That is another form of lying Til. As a member I had the right of complaint against both<br>
your officers. Like I said Til, I have copies of all our e-mail. In NONE of them<br>
do you bother to inform me that you are unhappy with me being absent.<br>
So why would that be a consideration? I am hardly gratefull for 'chances' that I dont ask for. That is 'YOUR' ego talking. Show me even ONE post where I ask<br>
you for a 'chance' please by all means do so. Do that and I will shut up forever.<br>
I spit on your 'ex post facto' charity, and your self-serving statements.<br>
If you had asked me to de-guild I would have. But you didnt. Thank you for addmitting that too. <br>
<br>
The ONLY thing I asked you for was consistancy. Which you refused to give.<br>
But at least the plebs in the guild now know that they better not cross<br>
Hoppkins and Dews.<br>

At the point where you tell your guild you are leaving the game, why do you feel that guild is obligated to leave you in its membership?  My guess is that most guilds would ask you to remove, remove you from membership lists, however may or may not remove your access from the board.  No one infringed on your rights Chit.  YOU quit.  Plain and simple.  Im sorry that you feel that you can quit and still have full member rights, but thats simply not the way we do things.  On a case by case basis, you may be allowed reentry once you return to game.  If you are allowed reentry, you will be on trial status during which time you are expected to be an active, contributing member.<br>
<br>
You sent a complaint to me in August this year and in that complaint you said your issue with hoppkins is about something that happened over a year ago.  Now let me just say this.  Why should anyone in CE care if a retired member has an issue with an active member that dates to before that member even joined the guild?  Chit, you had already quit eq (according to YOUR post) before Hopp even joined CE.<br>
<br>

Perhaps if you actually played the game you would know this to be false both Tilian and I informed people that you would not be continuing to post.  It seems to me before you calling people liars that perhaps you should learn about what it is you speak of.  Just because you perceive something to be a certain way does not make it true.  <br>

Exactly what terms of the merger stated that members who quit the game will continue to enjoy full active member status?  It is also standard guild practice to put members who have been inactive on trial when they return to playing (unless they have a very good reason that was posted in advance).  Are you saying that because you joined under the merger that our guild rules dont apply to you, that somehow you have special privileges?<br>

I didnt see that point in question anywhere *shrug*  I agree, he should have asked you to deguild.  But then again, who knew that someone that quit the game a year ago could cause so much trouble.<br>

<br>
Why? First CE has a policy of signing up for raids. If you dont, you dont go<br>
(unless they are nice - which they usually are)If you DO sign up, then you better<br>
damn well be there, or you face Ninya. I like Ninya, I would not wish to dissapoint her. There is no raid that I signed up for that I didnt attend. My obligation ends there. Anything else is a courtesy. If I had not signed up, why would anyone<br>
expect me to show? That doesnt make sence. At least not to me.<br>
<br>

*************************************************************<br>
Even though many in your guild (Who never realized you were a member because you were never on) had seen your posts here?<br>
*************************************************************<br>
Why should that matter? Hoppkins posts here all the times. That is one of my beefs. I dont respect inconsistancy. In fact I actively fight it. I dont give<br>
a damn what people think of what I post. Truth remains truth regardless of<br>
belief. So if people are upset to find me a member, that is THEIR problem<br>
not mine. So sorry - I wont miss you. ONLY the Guild leader who invited me<br>
and his wife do I feel an obligation to. They WERE informed 'in game' that I would be absent, they were also informed on this board. The fact that Til read it and replied, means he knew it.<br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
Now that Til posted his side, I can see mistakes on both sides. Til should have deguilded you at first oppurtunity when you returned, leaving it to you to re-apply since it had been so long.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
To deguild me w/o warning would have caused exactly what you see now.<br>
There is no guild policy that says if you are absent you must de-guild. If there WERE such a policy, CE would be minus quite a few people. I woudl resent that action and complain, as only I can =)<br>

*************************************************************<br>
True and they are.<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
At the point where you tell your guild you are leaving the game, why do you feel that guild is obligated to leave you in its membership?<br>
*************************************************************<br>
Why would I feel that they are NOT obligated?<br>
Because if they are NOT so obligated, you should be informed.<br>
I am not a mind reader,I wont guess at what you 'might' do.<br>
I read your policy(mostly non-existant) I asked a few questions and I left.<br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
My guess is that most guilds would ask you to remove, remove you from membership lists, however may or may not remove your access from the board. No one infringed on your rights Chit. YOU quit. Plain and simple. Im sorry that you feel that you can quit and still have full member rights, but thats simply not the way we do things. On a case by case basis, you may be allowed reentry once you return to game. If you are allowed reentry, you will be on trial status during which time you are expected to be an active, contributing member.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
If all that was true, I should have been told that Ninya. You cant tell me I was.<br>
And since you had BOTH my phone number AND my e-mail dont tell me I could<br>
not have been.<br>
<br>
<br>
**************************************************************<br>
You sent a complaint to me in August this year and in that complaint you said your issue with hoppkins is about something that happened over a year ago. Now let me just say this. Why should anyone in CE care if a retired member has an issue with an active member that dates to before that member even joined the guild? Chit, you had already quit eq (according to YOUR post) before Hopp even joined CE.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
If the famous policy, actually means anything. Then the identity of the informer<br>
should not matter Ninya. Since no attempt was made by anyone to inform me<br>
that I was no longer considered a member, why would you be surprised that<br>
I still thought I was? Since you personally were on the raid with both <br>
Hoppkins and Myself, how can you turn around and tell me that I was not a member on that raid?<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Perhaps if you actually played the game you would know this to be false both Tilian and I informed people that you would not be continuing to post. It seems to me before you calling people liars that perhaps you should learn about what it is you speak of. Just because you perceive something to be a certain way does not make it true. <br>
**************************************************************<br>
I said READERS Ninya, not members. I have no doubt whatever that you told<br>
Hoppkins and Dews that I would stop. I also have no doubt whatever that you didnt tell THEM to stop. Which I resent. If I had known that at the time I would<br>
NOT have stopped. <br>
In the quoted phrase Til did not tell the readers of this board that I complied.<br>
That is what I mean, in the quoted phrase.<br>

Quote:<br>

 By the terms of the merger I was addmitted as a full member. Every surviving member of AoR knows it. Thats means I expect to be treated as one. Not a recruit, or probationary. Thank you for addmitting you feel free to change the terms of the merger at will. That is another form of lying Til.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You gave up your full member rights when you quit the game in September of last year. Exactly what terms of the merger stated that members who quit the game will continue to enjoy full active member status? It is also standard guild practice to put members who have been inactive on trial when they return to playing (unless they have a very good reason that was posted in advance). Are you saying that because you joined under the merger that our guild rules dont apply to you, that somehow you have special privileges?<br>
**************************************************************<br>
All of that is ex-post-facto rationalization. You didnt tell me any of that, you didnt <br>
warn me I would be giving up anything. Since you didnt, I ignore it. I consider <br>
Til in violation of the agreement of the merger. That makes him a liar.<br>
You have no such policy anywhere on your board. Believe me, if it was there<br>
I would have seen it. At no time did the guild leader of AoR warn us that<br>
if we joined CE and went inactive for a period of time, that we would no longer be members. That is self-justifying tripe. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

 If you had asked me to de-guild I would have. But you didnt. Thank you for addmitting that too. <br>

<br>
I didnt see that point in question anywhere *shrug* I agree, he should have asked you to deguild. But then again, who knew that someone that quit the game a year ago could cause so much trouble.<br>
**************************************************************<br>
<br>
Ninya you have known me for almost three years. How could you possibly have not known what I would do? I mean seriously? You really should have both replied to my e-mail. What was so damn hard about asking Hoppkins to stop posting<br>
and Dews? I mean lets get real here Ninya? Are they on lifesupport that will shut<br>
off if they dont meet their Emmar post quota? That is ALL I ASKED YOU TO DO.<br>

This is to prevent CE from looking bad for having a member who is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> foolish</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> flamer.  Note the use of the word foolish.  Not everyone who posts on R &amp; F appears foolish by their posts. <br>
<br>
If someone from CE posted to flame the idiot who virtually raped that girl character in G Fay (c'mon you're an old timer, you should remember that) should they be gagged and kicked out of the guild because they have violated this policy?  No, because they haven't violated this policy.<br>
<br>
Chiteng, according to almost unanimous public perception of you, this perception being reached based upon your posts here: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you appear to be a fool</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (Fair or unfair, and I'm not about to enter into that debate with you, that IS the perception of you of the vast majority of people on this board)  <br>
<br>
Thus your posts make CE (by being a member of CE) look like fools for having you.  This is exactly what CE's policy is designed to prevent/stop.  CE doesn't want to be associated with a fool on the R &amp; F board.<br>
<br>
You claims of unfair application of this policy because Dews and Hoppkins post here in R &amp; F is not unfair as you claim, because the people that enforce this policy (the officers of course) apparently do not feel that Dews and Hoppkins posts on R &amp; F make themselves (and thus CE) look foolish.  <br>
<br>
That is the difference.  Reading your quote of the CE guild policy in your initial post, it doesn't say members of CE cannot post at all on the R &amp; F board.  It indicates that people who &quot;actively flame others/stir up trouble&quot; are not desired.  The inference is members should not make the guild look bad in R &amp; F.  That is a difference. Since Dews and Hoppkins do not appear foolish in their R &amp; F posts, CE does not look foolish by association.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, Dews and Hoppkins are NOT breaking the meaning of this policy, whereas you are.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the policy could have been slightly clearer in wording, but you are the first person to have this much trouble with it and bring it public to the R &amp; F board.  (Others may have problems with it, I have no idea, but you are the first to bring those problems if there are any to this board.)<br>
<br>
Take your (un)righteous indignation and draft a policy that does not require any inference or interpretation to get to its true meaning and purpose and the world will elect you lawgiver.  Until then, being intellectually dishonest about what that policy is really  supposed to do is just...dishonest.  And you are too moral to be dishonest, right?<br>

First if the policy isnt absolute, then it is subject to 'interpetation' much like what you are doing now. If I dont agree with the interpetation, we are now off to a bad start. Does anyone on this board think I would subordinate my opinion to anyone else? Only Ogmuk or Mitch would have a chance, and only if she asked me to. Which she would not do. (Luv ya Mitch)<br>
Even then, it isnt certain. Since as stated many times by me, I consider the majority of the posters here sheep, no one is surprised that<br>
your attempted rationale falls flat.<br>
<br>

it. Therefore it isnt possible that I create trouble on the board =)<br>
It is only a sign of the un-enlighted that they dont see that and fall to their<br>
knees in acknowledgement. =)<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
<br>
I already posted Til's permission to post. Either he is lying to set me up, or<br>
I have permission to post. In either case, I will post with a totally clear conscience.<br>
I will keep my righteous indignation, exactly where it is.<br>

CHAPTER 1<br>
<br>
<br>
The Rassendylls--With a Word on the Elphbergs<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder when in the world you're going to do anything, Rudolf?&quot;<br>
said my brother's wife.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear Rose,&quot; I answered, laying down my egg-spoon,<br>
&quot;why in the world should I do anything?  My position is a<br>
comfortable one.  I have an income nearly sufficient for my<br>
wants (no one's income is ever quite sufficient, you know),<br>
I enjoy an enviable social position: I am brother to<br>
Lord Burlesdon, and brother-in-law to that charming lady,<br>
his countess.  Behold, it is enough!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are nine-and-twenty,&quot; she observed, &quot;and you've done<br>
nothing but--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Knock about?  It is true.  Our family doesn't need to do things.&quot;<br>
<br>
This remark of mine rather annoyed Rose, for everybody<br>
knows (and therefore there can be no harm in referring to the<br>
fact) that, pretty and accomplished as she herself is, her family<br>
is hardly of the same standing as the Rassendylls.  Besides her<br>
attractions, she possessed a large fortune, and my brother<br>
Robert was wise enough not to mind about her ancestry.<br>
Ancestry is, in fact, a matter concerning which the next<br>
observation of Rose's has some truth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good families are generally worse than any others,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Upon this I stroked my hair: I knew quite well what she meant.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so glad Robert's is black!&quot; she cried.<br>
<br>
At this moment Robert (who rises at seven and works before breakfast)<br>
came in.  He glanced at his wife: her cheek was slightly flushed;<br>
he patted it caressingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's the matter, my dear?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;She objects to my doing nothing and having red hair,&quot; said I,<br>
in an injured tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh! of course he can't help his hair,&quot; admitted Rose.<br>
<br>
&quot;It generally crops out once in a generation,&quot; said my brother.<br>
&quot;So does the nose.  Rudolf has got them both.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish they didn't crop out,&quot; said Rose, still flushed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I rather like them myself,&quot; said I, and, rising,<br>
I bowed to the portrait of Countess Amelia.<br>
<br>
My brother's wife uttered an exclamation of impatience.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish you'd take that picture away, Robert,&quot; said she.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear!&quot; he cried.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good heavens!&quot; I added.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then it might be forgotten,&quot; she continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hardly--with Rudolf about,&quot; said Robert, shaking his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why should it be forgotten?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rudolf!&quot; exclaimed my brother's wife, blushing very prettily.<br>

As you are aware, we keep detailed attendance records on our raids.  I have no record of you attending a raid since 6/23/01.  In your email to me you referred to that raid where we fought a nasty dragon.  Well WW has dragons..is that what you are referring to? It is the last raid that I show you attending and therefore does fit in with you saying you didnt attend any more raids after that.  If so, Id like to point out that Hoppkins joined the guild in January 2002 some 4 months after that raid.  I asked you what he did to you during this raid and your response was he made it quite plain he didnt want me in this guild.  We are supposed to take action against a guildmember for that?  What did he do?  Did he look at you cross eyed?  Tell you to go jump in a lake?  What?  You claim that he is feeding information to people.  On what grounds?  Because you have a hunch?  We obviously cant go around punishing everyone that someone else has a hunch on.  That would pretty much be the end of a guild wouldnt ya say?  Any time you have a large number of people in one place, you are going to have people that you dislike and people that dislike you. Its a fact of life.  Generally speaking, we try to work together to overcome that.  That doesnt mean you have to fall in love with that person, but it means that you put your differences aside for the good of the guild.  <br>
<br>
Rules of guilds change over time and as a guild grows.  At one point we used to random NBG on loot.  Then the rule was changed to our current loot policy.  Does that mean that we have broken an agreement to the people that were in the guild before that?   If you want a guild to grow, you have to adjust as it grows.  Sometimes that means things change.  Why did this particular rule change?  Cause its very unfair to active members who carry the guild for raid after raid after raid to have someone show up who hasnt even logged in in 7 months and loot something that the active member has been coming to raid after raid to try to get.  As our records indicate, normally when this happens, the person who was gone for 7 months plays a week or two then vanishes off into the wild blue yonder again.  Im sorry, I may like that person, but they just wasted my time and 50 of my guildmates time obtaining an item to rot on an unused character when it could have been used to advance the guild.  If you come back to the guild after a long absence, the atmosphere will have changed and may no longer be the guild that suits your needs.  This time period allows the guild and the returning member to reaquaint themselves to make sure they are still an appropriate match.  Nowhere in the merger did it state CEs rules may never change from how they are now.  Just because you dont like it, doesnt mean the guild didnt have a right to do it.  Btw, not every rule is posted.  We dont have a rule posted that says if you scam someone you get kicked out.  But yet common decency demands it (at least in my view) and we would expect our members to expect that.  We cant possibly make a rule for every single event that may happen in course of years that we spend playing eq.  Even if we had the foresight to predict every little thing that could happen, we would be so busy writing rules that we would never get to actually play eq and no one would ever read the 1200 page post totally anyway.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I said READERS Ninya, not members. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Why should we post what we tell our members here? Its no one elses business but the people involved.  If you were looking for a public pulling down of a member, Im sorry but as you can see, you were misguided in thinking that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I also have no doubt whatever that you didnt tell THEM to stop. Which I resent. If I had known that at the time I would<br>
NOT have stopped. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Well Chit, Im sorry but they were told to stop.  You complained they started again and I asked you to point me in the right direction and you gave me undated, pulled out of context cut and pastes including Hopp posting...people leave bandit rings on their bodies so they can loot more and sell them and come back to get the one off their body.  Thats a flame?  Some anon person made a flame about your skills and therefore its Hoppkins?  Do you think that I can come to a fair conclusion on if something was a flame based on a one sided arguement.   Our policy doesnt say no one may ever post on the emarr board about anything.<br>
<br>
If you didnt think attendance was of value to the guild why was this comment included in the above mentioned email &quot;....When you reproach me for non-participation, remember that I have reasons...&quot;<br>
<br>
I would think it would be a common assumption that if you quit a game, you are no longer a member of a guild.  They do have to replace you, you no longer serve the guild as a whole in any way.  <br>

As for my leadership, Ive been accused of everything from an @#%$ to dictator to a good leader.  One thing though I have always done is look out for the guild as a whole.  Unfortunately you didnt make CE your permanent home, you made it your vacation home, to come and go as you will.  Used to work that way, it doesnt anymore.<br>
<br>
Our policies are pretty clear in where it matters, loot, spells, and epic stuff.  That is what our foundation is on.  We have a few policies that are not in writing, but common practice, one of those being if you disappear without letting us know, you are on trial when you come back in relation to loot and spells.  I think most any would agree on this.<br>
<br>
We dont run a complicated guild.  We are not hardcore, but we can do most of the hardcore stuff in the game.  The key here is participation, that part is where you fell short.<br>
<br>
As for me being a liar, I dont have the time to go back and review what I said to you or Hoppkins or Dews or anyone for that matter.  In fact I would consider it a waste of time at this point.  The only thing I know is I told everyone in the guild to leave you alone and give you a chance when you showed up out of the blue that day.  You didnt run with that chance.  Dont blame me for that.  You started right in with the conspiracy theories acting like a paranoid maniac about everything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwyvernwyrmsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wyvern Wyrmsong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/20/02 12:39:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> What about the stipulation to leave CE out of whatever you post?  That permission was not carte blanche as you claim.  The stipulation was to avoid bringing up CE in your posts, thus to avoid making CE look bad.  Hey what do you know, we are right back to the purpose of the policy.<br>
<br>
Of course policy is not absolute, that is my entire point.  By definition, policy is a guiding principal, not an absolute rule.  <br>
<br>
Someone must always interpret policy, and apply it.  No one has ever written a law/policy/rule etc that does not require some interpretation and someone to apply it.<br>
<br>
The law for murder does not read: &quot;If you kill someone you are guilty of murder.&quot;  There are exceptions, interpretations, extenuating circumstances.  The law must be applied individualy to each unique set of facts, because no two set of facts are exactly the same.  The *policy* behind the law against murder is to prevent people from killing other people, but you cannot write the rule or law up the same was as you can state the guiding prinicpal of laws about murder because it is not that simple.<br>
<br>
What about the fact (according to you) Tilian did tell you way back to stop posting on R &amp; F, and that by your own admission, you did stop posting.  Why did he tell you to stop posting?  Because it violated the stated policy.  Why does CE have this policy?  Because posting the way you did and do makes CE looks foolish by association on R &amp; F.<br>
<br>
It does not matter what you know, or what opinions you have, the CE policy is not in place for your opinion alone.  It is in place to protect the public's opinion of CE.<br>
<br>
Your entire complaint as I understand it was that CE applied the policy unfairly against you but did not put a gag order on Hoppkins and Dews as well.  Unfair application of the policy.<br>
<br>
My point is Dews and Hoppkins were not judged by the CE guild leaders to be violating the policy, thus they were not gagged.  You interpret any posting by them to be violating the policy, the guild leaders obviously have a different definition of what violates the policy.  And their definition is the one that matters.<br>
<br>
Your continuing to post here is not the point either.  CE's policy no longer applies to you because you are no longer a member of CE.  You cannot make CE look bad by your continuing to post here, you can only affect people's perceptions about yourself.<br>
<br>
If you can convince this board (i.e. the public) that the posts made by Dews and Hoppkins on this board make CE look bad/foolish/etc., then you might at least have a valid point about the policy being unfairly applied to you.   But you cannot, so you do not. <p>Impresario Wyvern Wyrmsong <br>
