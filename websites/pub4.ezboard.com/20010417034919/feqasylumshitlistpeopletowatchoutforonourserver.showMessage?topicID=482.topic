I had hoped never to have a reason to post in here. However I regret to say that a situation has occured. I should say is occuring. Since I am merely on my 2nd computer typing this while I am also still online and looking at the offender in question. <br>
    For thirteen hours Adikt Shunn guild leader of The Bleak Cabal has been online camping the AC in the Ocean of tears, I know because not only am I an officer in the guild but I have been on off and on throughout the night to play and he was allways right there in oot camping the AC. At about 9:30 am pst I guess Zarton was in South Ro attemting to camp the faster spawning "non-static" AC. He was supposedly KS'ed. This is regrettable of course. then however he decided to come over to the Ocean of Tears proceeded to walk up to Adikt and stands there next to the spawn.<br>
    When Adikt walked up to him and asked him what he was doing he responded with "I'm camping the AC" Adikt proceeded to point out his pet and said that he had been there for 13 hours and was allready camping him. Zarton then responds with "you don't own this camp!" "Share, FFA, or I'm calling a GM!". He then proceeded to Kill every spawn from that point forward. As a 55th level mage he didn't need to do much to steal from a Necro 4 levels lower.<br>
This is when Adikt sent me the tell along with a few other close friends to come help him once we started to arrive he continued to do everything he could to steal our kills. We had a 51 Necro ( Adikt ) a 54th level Necro, A 52nd level Shaman among others, each with a pet where applicable. He then proceeded to call us bully's for ganging up on him etc. and since there are currently no GM's online there was not much I could think of to do He is also being relatively slanderouse in Out Of Character etc. but still will not leave. However since Mages do dish out alot of damage, almost as much as wizards in nukes, he is still rarely but occasionally stealling kills. I think this behavior is inexcusible, and amidst rumors ( unconfirmed ) that the character was purchased off of playerauctions.com. He at best seems extremely immature. I was starting this thread as a way to let others know what is going on and a way for others to post similar experiances if there are any. Where are the GM's when you need them. I will post back if and when he finally leaves the beach.<br>

I understand that he I'm sure was frusterated but I will not consistantly sit back and try to explain to someone why what they are doing is not acceptable behavior. I am not his mother. Furthermore I remind you that I did sit there for over an hour listening to him taunt us after stealing whatever spawn he actually put effort into. We are not cruel or quick to condemn however give me a break. at 55th level this guy should have known better. whether I had waited 1 day 2 days or 15 minutes wouldn't have made a dent in my decision to post here. Talking to him.....every time we tried....simply made things worse, he consistantly responded with childish remarks and comments.<br>

And that's just in the public channels; I have no idea what transpired before that in the private channels.<br>
<br>
I know that the &quot;play nice&quot; rules don't strictly forbid Zarton's actions. If a GM or guide had to settle the dispute, the answer would have been to go eenie-meenie and whoever is lucky enough to get the AC is...well, is lucky.<br>
<br>
But the OoT ancient cyclops has always been a respected &quot;camp&quot; ... he only spawns in a relatively small region of the zone, and it's easy to pick out the placeholders. In all my time in the zone, I've always seen players respectfully waiting their turns, sometimes for several days, before getting a chance at the cyclops, knowing that their own camp period would also be respected.<br>
<br>
But to recap, this guy was being an all-around jerk right from the beginning. He was also stealing legitimate placeholder kills from the necro...even if you're going to be a jerk and contest a respected spawn site, don't go all-out and deny the original camper the right to a little pocket change and experience for his time (the necro was low enough level to actually get a little experience from some of the kills....Zarton couldn't have gotten experience from anything in the entire zone except the dino and the warrior guildmistress).</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#D5D4D5><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzartonthetank.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarton the Tank</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>n00b!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>4/10/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>2:22:46 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Time? was right.</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Slanderous remarks?<br>
<br>
I was only defending what I felt was right. I showed up in OoT to see if the AC was camped and when I get there I asked if he would like to take turns because of what happened to me in SRo(3 hours of clearing the desert for some monk to show up in 10 minutes and kill ac in 2 seconds), and to my suprise I get mouthed by the shorty so it pretty much put the Icying on the cake and I made it my mission to stay there. I don't always do that sort of thing, only to those who think EQ revolves around them. I didn't even curse and I was polite the whole time.<br>
<br>
Making fun of you guys when I actually got a kill from you's?<br>
<br>
I never did that even though I was kind of suprised that a lvl 57 rogue, 51 necro, 54 necro, 52 warrior and you couldn't do enought dmg to KS. I am not going to mention any names.<br>
<br>
Why I left?<br>
<br>
Because I figured the lil feller had enough punishment and misery, and if the AC did spawn I wasn't gonna take the ring anyway. Instead I went to SK and then back to oasis.<br>
<br>
P.S. Sorry you had to witness all that but it was for his own good and him calling a ton of people didn't help the situation 1 bit, I mean look at what you have done, You didn't even know half the story and you ran to here and started postin. I bet you do that allot.<br>

Well the multiple petitions sent to Frizz (which won't be dealt with, due to how smoothly things work when you just leave it up to GM's) all came from others in the zone also I believe your story is a little flawed.<br>
1. There is no way that 1 monk showed up and KS'ed you in South RO if you could still KS us and there were 5 of us 4 above 50.  You probably got confused by the fact that you <u>can't CAMP a non-static spawn</u>. Like the AC in South Ro. The AC in OOT however IS a static spawn, something you <u>CAN</u> camp. Hence unless you hit the AC in ro first ( which I doubt ) The monk wasn't KS'ing.<br>
2. Defending what you felt was right? how the heck can coming in and trying to take over someone elses camp be right. Are other players required to bow to your wishes? I had not read that in any of the new patch updates so I'm sorry I just wasn't informed.<br>
3. As far as the slander goes, I never said you swore, I said that you were simply making slanderous remarks at the fact that you could take the kills whenever you wanted to, amoung other things. All of which many ears heard not just mine.<br>
4. Regarding my posting here "without knowing half the story"? I did know the whole story. I was in contact with Adikt the whole time, I was simply in The Overthere hunting untill you made it clear you were going to KS his camp, and began doing so. Thats when I ported over to help out. I also have a wonderfull little gaggle of witnesses to your behaviore who were there talking about it in ooc and shouts. It was also at THEIR request ( the members in my group as well as others in the zone ) that I should post here. <br>
5. Most importantly Zarton <u>no</u> I don't post here all the time and right away. I read here all the time yes but This is actually <u>my first post</u> to this board at all. I'm sorry you had to be the target of it.<br>
<br>
P.S. I also was E-mailed the logs from my guild leader regarding the period where you make it quite clear how badly you needed those boots etc. I know you had no intention of "not taking the ring anyways" what other reason is there for you to be out there. at 55th level you would get soooooo little experiance and even that on only the highest level cyc that spawns.<br>

I'm sure it's just easier for you to try and turn this around throwing around accusations at others to take the focus off of you. Consequently there IS no justifiable reason to steal someones camp OR kill steal. Even on the chance that ( and I am not saying that this was the case this time ) someone was getting something for another character. If that person is still getting experiance for all the kills he can camp it till the mobs are giving no xp and as long as the player <u>waits their turn</u> and informs whoever is next on the list when he logs he has every right to solo that camp. This rule goes for nearly every static single spawn. i.e. hermit in S.K., rangers in W.C./E.C. guards etc. you ask first then if you can't get in a group or are refused, <u>you get on the list and wait</u>. Next time consider that before demanding that you be allowed to group.</font><P><center><img src="http://fp1.centurytel.net/sect/Stored%20Sigs/AeonSigniturelrg.jpg"></center>

If someone is in need of the item I don't go and farm the damn thing, I let them take it. And like I said before, I changed after adikt said what he said and I was no longer after the ring but was just enraged yet I kept my cool. If Adikt was insulted by common words then thats not my problem. Talking about accusations, who was it after 20 minutes to start posting about me here, You. Oh I am sorry that I am not like the rest of everyone on EQ and waits in line, is that what you are all paying for? to wait in line? especially if the person already has the item? I don't think so. And I was going to let him have the stupid ring anyway because he sure fooled me. I understand that you have to defend him because he can't defend himself. he's a Liar and a Cheat, and your just defending that.

<br>
Yes I was there at the time  when all this took place, you were intentionally kill stealing Adikt our group had dealt the first damage to the mobs yet you felt it your right to join in.<br>
<br>
You had made it clear to Adikt and indeed all of us that your intention was to kill the AC despite the fact that Adikt had been there many hours before you.<br>
<br>
You were using your ability for DD casting to steal kills and you knew there was little we could do.<br>
<br>
You were not gaining xp from the kills you were simply stealing the kills and depriving Adikt of experience so that he would get angry and leave so that you would then take the spawn.<br>
<br>
There were other people in that zone before you had arrived that also wanted to camp the Ancient Cyclops. They were on a list and would have been told  when Adikt had got his ring ( for whatever character he needed it for ) and to come take over. That is how it works in OOT and has done for a long time.<br>
<br>
Your blatant disregard for fellow players is disgusting I hope never to meet  you again in game.<br>
<br>
You quote Verants rules on spawns and at the same time break the very same rules by stealing kills, there is no justification for your actions whatsoever..<br>
<br>
You are a fool Zarton and all you have managed to do this day is go to great lengths to prove it.<br>
<br>
I spoke to Frizznik re your actions also when he sent me a tell regarding my petition and hope that he takes action against you.<br>
<br>
To Adikt I am sorry you had to go through all that crap today and hope you got your ring in the end you deserved to get it unlike Zarton.<br>
<br>
You gloated in OOC channel re your ability to KS a group including a 57 Rogue and a 54 necro and others, these others including myself were there to primarily be witness to what you were doing.<br>
<br>
People if you see this guy hovering around your spawns beware.. he will it appears not think twice before stealing your kills.<br>
<br>
I had hoped that I would never have to post  on these boards indeed this is my first post on this forum and please god let it be my last.<br>
<br>
By the way to the person who asked if Zarton was guilded the answer to that is no.<br>
<br>
Zarton has been added to this list after abiding by the rules stated at the header ,  he is dishonorable and is to be avoided. <br>

<br>
I dont know you Zarton, but you sound like a pretty big dick to me.<br>
<br>
First off, what makes you think it is your place to teach someone a lesson.  So what if he was a little short when you asked if he could share the spawn.  He had been camping if for a long time, was probably tired, and really getting anxious about getting the ring.  If I had camped the spawn that long, I would be short with you too.  Not to mention a little upset of the fact that you even assumed I was going to share it.<br>
<br>
Second, what is all this crap about you not waiting in lines.  Sorry, there is a thing in the game called &quot;play nice&quot;.  Some things require a lot of time to get and most of us EQ players are respectfull of others invested time when it comes to a long camp.  It is an unwritten code so to speak.  It starts a very low lvls and I am sure if you had any sense at all you would realize that.  Following this &quot;code&quot; will get you much further in the game than being a total f***ing asshole and KS others long camps.<br>
<br>
And lastly, you must be either five years old, or have th maturity of one.  I still cant believe that you think you were right in comming up to this guys camp and just start KSing him because he was short with you.  Get a life!  And the fact that you said you left because you felt the little one had learned a lesson shows great maturaty on your part.  I give you a big two thumbs down dick head!!!<br>

No I am not his mother nor yours, and grow tired of having to constantly remind people like you of the ethics, and general guidelines that should be followed "in game". I'm sure there are many others who feel this way as well. I won't even bring age into this being as how I know a number of younger players with greater etiquette. Maturity is not distinguished by age alone. I do however refuse to let my "in game spirit" be brought down by those people. There are those who can just shrug it off and say "oh well some people just don't play/work well with others, that's life for ya" and sometimes I wish I could be one of those people, less offended but I'm not. I just don't have the self control I suppose to "let things slide". I hope this to be my last post in this thread as well.

<br>
The FIRST time I was going after the AC, I was in my Late 30's-early 40's(I forget..), and, I went to SRO. There was a 55 Chanter there, and she was allready hunting the AC, going around and wiping everything out. I asked her if I could join her, then take a turn going after the AC after she got her ring.(I wanted to help her get hers, so I could have MY turn, hehehe)<br>
<br>
The AC Popped, and, between me, her, and her pet, we killed it. Something else then Agro'ed on her, and, she had to fight it. I was right next to the AC at the time. Because we were grouped, I could have very easally Ninja Looted it.<br>
<br>
I did not. I went over and helped her. I was happy that she had gotten the ring, and now maybe I had a chance to get the AC.<br>
<br>
She looted the ring, paused, then she said she had a problem. She needed the Boots for a friend, but, in her opinion, I deserved a shot at the ring for helping(She would Multiquest it). I told her that it was cool, I expected nothing, was just helping her so I could get closer to my turn. She would not accept that. She told me to take on of two choices.<br>
<br>
1) She would allow me to ROLL for the ring. whoever won it, won it.<br>
<br>
2) She had an Extra pair of GEB's she would let me have if I passed up on my chance to roll.<br>
<br>
I told her she did not have to again, but, you cannot argue with a woman. Understanding what a pain it is to wait for the AC, and, knowing that the GEB's were just Extra loot to her. I accepted the GEB's. I then asked, just for fun, that we roll to see if I would have gotten the ring.<br>
<br>
We rolled.<br>
<br>
I lost.<br>
<br>
Hehehe.<br>
<br>
(All my guild was ragging me about getting GEB's, a certain Ceela wanted mine, hehehe)<br>
<br>
The thing is, I played with integrity. I could have easally Ninja looted, but, I did not, and, I treated her with total respect, expecting nothing other than helping her to get done with the AC, so I could have my turn. She turned it around on me, and showed just as much integrity.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (/hug that Enchanter, who's Name I somehow lost over time, but, thank you again. Drop me a tell in game if ya see me!)<br>
<br>
The OOT AC spawn is a Static Camp. First one at the camp gets it. Take a number. Wait your turn. <br>
<br>
The AC in SRO is a random MOB, and, it has always been respected that whoever has first contact with it gets the kill. Stand back and let them have it.<br>
<br>
When you play with integrity, maybe you do not get all the PHAT LEWTZ that others who bully and Kill steal get, but, you get even a greater reward:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <br>
