<br>
Im sorry that you got dragged into this thread. That was not my doing nor my intention. <br>
Laaw on the other hand has defined himself by his actions: he ninja looted. Plain and simple. <br>
<br>
He also proved to be an unpleasant puller that night. The major thing here is that he was REMORSELESS and GLOATING.<br>
<br>
 ...FYI, that means his conscious remains clear after breaking a rule in EQ that is BANNABLE. You should be happy I didnt /report /petition his ass off the server. But Im not the kind of person to be that big of a jerk.<br>
<br>
 There are many facets of this game that people dont consider 'that big a deal' when they indeed ARE. Laaw still seems to think the game is a FFA game that he can play in his back yard without any consequences....keep dreaming.<br>

Generally our first or second kills, this was a while back (read a month or so) and while I don't really believe in the shitlist, I think most of these posts tend to be witch hunts or bruised egos, in this case I think its justified, this guy has no remorse for what he does which is just wrong.

However I disagree with you about Laaw...it does not appear that he has changed a bit nor is remorseful about his actions, so he definitely belongs here. <p><img src="http://alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/sig2.jpg">

Hope to see u again ultimikik and all of u who are posting against laaw, if u can group with me and see i am really a good person and up here maybe just maybe u can try giving laaw a chance also. i am just acting in his defense because he can not post because his ez board is messed and i dont want this to go on and on without anyone saying one good thing about him.  he might not be all good i admitt but certinaly not all bad.  JUST NEVER LET HIM PULL and u will be fine. and buddy if u read this and dont believe your pulling sucks from all these people believe your buddy orcalan!  so lets all give laaw one more chance to prove he dosent suck and see what happens.  those of u who already made up your minds and do not know laaw that is fine just be fair before u judge.  I see he has jioned a new guild and is trying to start his over so one more try wouldnt hurt.  sorry i had to post here.  <br>
