Working within a guild is like working in a company and each individual reflects that guild or company accordingly.<br>
<br>
Have any of you ever gone to a store, for example, and ran into a unfriendly, uncaring, or just simply a rude employee? Did you ever complain to a manager about them? Or did you decide that if that place employs and retains people like that, that you won't shop there any longer? If so, are you blaming the company for their employees?<br>
<br>
Looking at an entire guild based upon the actions of just ONE of their members is the same thing. One person CAN, and often does, impact a person's opinion of that guild, good, bad, or indifferent. And further, if they condone or defend that individual's actions, then one can naturally assume that is part of their &quot;culture&quot; and you must make the decision to accept it or not. Ultimately, it is all a matter of opinions: the wronged, the accused, and their affiliations and defenders. However, if a company/guild does NOT address an obvious complaint quickly and with the thought of &quot;making things right&quot;, then I would submit that they simply condone it, regardless of words to the contrary.<br>

<br>
I would say that DT isn't responsible for Alnaron's actions -- but seriously, this forum is supposed to be a last resort.  However ineffective the guild might have been at making Alnaron act sensibly, it should still be tried before this.  At the least, the guild officers are aware of the problem before it hits here, they're not surprised, and when it's all over the offender can't strut around telling his friends you apologized -- because they'd know better.<br>
<br>
It's just better all around to try everything before coming here -- and that most definitely includes the guild leadership.  If there's anyone on Lanys that can keep a renegade in check (and often, there isn't), it'll be his guildmaster.<br>

<br>
This is not the normal shitlisting. This is a person who has been on this list more then once, and more then a few people have had problems with him in game. <br>
<br>
Also, the guild he was in previously to one of his shitlistings booted him over what happened. Sadly that obviously hasn't had an effect, for here he is once again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Again, I truly don't think Alnaron is malicious. I don't think he does anything he's been shitlisted for to be an asshole intentionally. I think that he simply doesn't think about his actions, or the consequences they may have on other people. Therefore I think it's more of a maturity issue then anything else.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly this has adversely effected other people's gameplay, and as such people may wish to avoid him. And that is what this list is for. I think people are able to make up their own minds based on what happened if this is a player they would wish to avoid or not. /shrug. <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

This list *IS* a flame board you ever count how many off the topic things were posted on this thread? <br>
<br>
If the moderator was smart they would look at the main topic of the post and think for a minute. Maybe i've been up here more then once but they accually had a reasonable being for being there. This one is ermm... Alnaron killed me in the arena im gonna shit list him. You cant account for it personally being a GM hosted event blah blah blah if you were there you would know how un oganized it was. all frizznik did was ask for your money then told everyone in the arena to a pillar then he locked the door and said fight =P<br>
<br>
My point is, the other events said to on this post dont really matter because they wernt given their own place on the shit list. Everyone could care less how you feel about someone or what happened with you and them. The person whom i killed i guess had a reason he thought i should be here, cool. But it doesnt fit under your *RULES* for something being on the shit list moderators :) <br>
<br>
Stop making up damned rules as you go and keep to the list, the ones you already have up. And it might be smart to cover yourself professionally in a flame war or, well dont even get into it since your a moderator. Your job is to moderate the boards so poor posts who dont fit the criteria are removed, and instead you stuck your heads into the flame yourself and changed your views in such a way that you over looked your own posted rules. <br>
<br>
Think for a minute, heh. <p><FONT COLOR="black">

<br>
This is about your actions ruining something for someone else. Why? Because *you* thought it was funny to do. It obviously wasn't only not funny for the other person, but completely ruined a GM event for them.<br>
<br>
You seem to still think it was funny. /boggle<br>
<br>
Look, this guy was level 31. He obviously didn't expect to live 'til the end of the event. He wasn't there to be the last one standing, unless he's on drugs. But he didn't expect to be ganked by his own teammate for no reason, while that teammate screamed &quot;You're a gnome&quot;.<br>
<br>
Bullying is *never* fun for the victim and that's exactly what you did. You were a higher level then he was, and you killed your team mate because you could, and because <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> found it amusing. Obviously he and many others did not. And even your apologies are half-assed. You seem to just miss the entire point. <br>
<br>
Let me give you an analogy. It's the BIG football game. Your team is getting wiped out, so the coach puts in the fourth string bench warmers. What the hell, you're going to lose anyway, and it's the last game of the year. Timmy has never been in the game because Timmy barely made the team. Maybe some day he'll be good, but he's a little freshman now and he sucks. But this is his big moment. Yeah you're gonna lose, but today he feels like a star. He scans the stands hoping to see his friends and family. He knows he's not going to score that touchdown or anything, but he can dream of it. Suddenly the ball snaps and out of nowhere he's tackled from behind...by his own teammate. &quot;What the fuck??&quot; he says. AHHHH you're a COW (The Bulls being the name of the other team) &quot;What the fuck, no I'm not get the fuck off me goddamn it!&quot; The play is over, and so is the game. Timmy's big moment is fucking ruined. Why? Because some bully thought it would be funny to tackle him. I mean they were losing anyway, why not have some fun?<br>
<br>
Because for the other person it wasn't fun. Plus, I'm sure there are other people on the team who regardless if they're losing still want to play to win.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's just a game...but when your idea of fun <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ruins</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the game for other people, then you need to stop and fucking think.<br>
<br>
As to the shitlist rules, let's look at them.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #1 - All posts must be made with the subject heading bearing the name of the specific person being shitlisted. Posts must be done by players actually playing on Lanys T`Vyl, by a registered EZboard account. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yup that was done. The topic is Alnaron.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #2 - No posts may be made anonymously. Your characters name in game must be made known if you are to put another character's name on the shitlist. <br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yup that was done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #3 - MOST posts are given a trial lifespan of 7 days. During this time, players may add other similar things happening with the shitlisted player, defend them, etc. However, the lifespan of a post is not guaranteed. Posts such as &quot;JoeDr00d didn't port me to EC&quot; will be deleted on sight, as will any posts that are deemed by the moderators to be unworthy of even a trial. <br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yup that was done. I haven't added the other things you've been shitlisted for because I think that would be inflamatory. I'm sure other some other people don't remember those incidences, and quite honestly I think there is more then enough on this one issue without bringing up old issues. However I'm sure a few remember them well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #4 - During this 7 day period, if the story is still being uncovered or added to, the post will be allowed to stay until a relative period of stasis. At the end of this period, it will be determined by the moderators whether or not this person is going to be deleted or remain on list. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> During this time, you and the person you ganked have been able to respond. As well as your guildmates in Dark Trinity. I think for the most part people's posts have been rather well thought out and not overall flamage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #5 - Shitlisted Players that are deemed worthy of their placement here will be kept on the shitlist permanently, accessible from the main page of lanys.com as well as the forum itself. To be deemed worthy means that there has been enough testimony and evidence brought forth to make a substantial case. In the world of EQ, 100% proof is nearly impossible to come by, but common sense and good judgement are more than enough. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The person who posted laid out what happened pretty well. You agreed that it did indeed happen. Most people agree that it was a pretty fucked up thing to do, and it ruined that person's gameplay in the GM event. Seems pretty cut and dry to me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> #6 - Shitlist posts that are deemed insufficient based on their merits will be locked and taken down, with an explanation given by the moderator. In some cases the explanation may be left open so players can respond, but in many, the case is closed when the moderator renders it so. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There's no debate on the facts. He said you did it, you agreed you did it. Your only explanation was that you found it amusing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We'd like to stress the severity of being posted here. A post here means that the said player should be avoided at all costs, as they have proven themselves to be dishonorable. Please make every attempt to resolve the issue with the player's guild, the player's friends, the player, etc., before posting here. Please treat this as a last resort. <br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Given not only this post, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> but your previous history on the shitlist</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> this belongs here. This is not a case of one time your actions have ruined game play for others. The other posts no longer exist, though they also amply had enough to keep them up here. (Personally I don't think *any* posts should be removed once they met the old rules, they can be bumped off if there's nothing to add to them, but that's just my opinion). <br>
<br>
The person who shitlisted you did try to speak with you about it. And obviously there was not only no resolution, but the exchange added to the conflict. The poster has more then enough based on his experience with you to believe you should be avoided at all costs. Whether or not other people feel the same...I think they have more then enough information here to make a valid judgement.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also please realize that situations or cases arise where the moderators have to make a judgement call. In these cases, the decisions of the moderator are final, but must be made unanimously by the moderators<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
And this caveat basically says regardless of the previous rules <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> special circumstances</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> may arise where the moderators decide to remove a post that has merit (such as in the case of your previous shitlistings being removed. Or leave one up.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I think that this shitlisting not only meets the rule requirements of the board, but even if it did not, there are more then enough &quot;special circumstances&quot; of people having had problems with you in the past to merit this shitlisting remaining.<br>
<br>
Again Alnaron, I don't think you're acting this way to intentionally be a prick. I think that you don't think. However I also think it's sad that in hindsight you still seem to think that it was funny, regardless of the obvious impact your actions had on another player. Now perhaps if someone had done the same to you, you wouldn't have had a problem with it. However, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> they</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> did. And it's not unreasonable for them to have a problem with what you did. <br>
<br>
There's enough up here to leave it. And there's enough information here for people to make up their own minds about both the shitlisting, and if you're someone they wish to avoid in game. <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

<br>
so here's the short version:<br>
<br>
#1 - you asked us long ago to remove your shitlist post.  We resisted. but we did it.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WHEN WE DID IT WE TOLD YOU TO KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
#2 - you're back here, and for good reason.  Acting like an ass and ruining someone's entire experience, and finding it amusing.<br>
<br>
#3 - the moderators have made a decision.  in light of your past history, your post shall stay up here.  There will be no taking down this time.<br>
<br>
you had your chance, you blew it.  end of story.<br>

I have been laughing my ass off so hard reading this thread due to the sheer size of it. We're on page 8 for Al killing a newbie at a GM event roflmao. This is some of the funniest shit ever posted. Al's just a immature teenager, who give's a flying fuck if he did this and that to you LOL. <br>
<br>
Man you people get so emotional over all this bullshit. Frizz DT'd me because I was using an illusion which I wasn't aware of. What did I do? I floated over back in, killed a few more people then ran from frizz for 3 minutes while he tried to DT me. Should I be Shitlisted for cheating? ROFLMAO, the whole event was just a gag full of fun, I saw ton's of elves bound inside the arena, killed most of em over and over and over, it was a blast. These event's aren't really regulated and thus things like this come here. But they don't belong here, and shouldn't be here for any other reason then a laugh.<br>
<br>
Man I was cracking up the whole time, couldn't read most of it because it was so funny. Oh and that gnome who mentioned the dick to body proportions is my new personal God.<br>

<br>
I think there needs to be some sort of IQ test before a player can log onto EQ. Keep all the blithering idiots like Alnaron and Sepnir out. <br>
<br>
I detest stupidity. Especially when someone feels like they are required to be an asshole because of it. Alnaron and Sepnir are two examples of this.<br>
<br>
It's a shame that bein' an idiot doesn't preclude you from playing a video game well. If that were the case, Alnaron would still be struggling to get past level 5, and Sepnir would still be tryin' to figure out how to make a character.<br>

What does your cheating have to do with the whole thread? If you HAD read, you would *maybe* have understood what the issue was.<br>
