You can judge for yourselves whether Im overreacting.<br><br>I grouped with a wood elf warrior named Joeler, she was the leader, in FM fighting giants. We killed a couple, and then she invited 3 others. Out of the first 3 giants we pulled, whether or not you can believe this, one dropped a lumberjack cap and one dropped a forest loop! Let me type real quick the report I sent to the GM's.<br><br>Draques has looted a Lumberjack Cap.<br>Joeler says to the group &quot;Roll on cap.&quot;<br>Joeler has looted a Forest Loop.<br>You have been removed from the group.<br>Taking a screenshot...<br>You told Joeler, &quot;Are we going to roll on loop?!&quot;<br>Joeler tells you, &quot;No sire&quot;<br><br>Then Joeler /quit out.<br>Now 2 members of our group had died in this battle. We had not agreed to roll on high items, but I think the fact that she said &quot;roll on cap&quot; proves that she wanted to roll on high items. I reported the story to a gm and petitioned. He said that he'd send it to the server GM and that he wasn't sure if anything could be done about it, but that he would do his best, and that at least there was proof. But that was upsetting enough without what happened later. I was brave enough to actually tell the zone not to group with this person, even though I have never before maligned a person to the zone. <br><br>I got on later to have some fun with Kharne and try to forget about what had happened. At the bank in Firiona Vie, I got a tell from Joeler asking me to tp her to WC!!! I told her that she had to be kidding and that I was in the group that she had stolen the loop from. She then said to me, &quot;ha ha there's nothing you can do about it&quot; She then SHOWED ME THE F$&amp;#ing LOOP IN TRADE WINDOW and said haha I have a loop and you dont. She emoted /laugh at me over and over and over. Kharne, ever valient, =) was right there and when I gated to get the $&amp;^# away from her he told the zone what she had done. She then went to EC and tried to sell it there. Kharne followed her and told about her to that zone while I /petioned again, this time about her harassment. I reported all the lines of chat about her laughing at me, and this time talked to a different gm, who said the best thing to do was to go with the /reports and he'd give them to the server gm who would be on at 4pst tonight. By this time word had gotten around from Kharne telling the zones and myself and the people I grouped with doing the same. Well, one of them at least. Kharne told her guild officer, which was Oracles Of Fate, I believe, and they said they'd get in contact with me later. <br>Here's the kicker. While I was talking to the GM, the b$&amp;*^ ran by me AGAIN in Lake zone and emoted /makes a rude gesture at Kemidra. Tillbone tells me that she is going to try to say that I had just joined as the giant died, and that she didn't let us roll for that reason. But one of the people that died, the necro, says he'll stand up for me if I give his name to the gms, because he knew I was in the group the whole time.<br>Please don't misunderstand. I couldn't care less about the damn loop. I just want that #&amp;^%$&amp;*^%#^&amp;@%#^% punished for what she did. I am so upset, but really glad that everyone I talked to was so supportive, including when I told the zones. Kharne says they were supportive when he did it too.<br><br>Anyway, that's my rant. Any thoughts you have would be greatly appreciated. I've never been this upset at someone in the game in my life. I have also let them know on Caster's Realm, since a lot of people read that.<br><br>Kemi<br>One seriously pissed off druid<br><br>BTW, whoever it was that said in guild a while ago that they wouldn't want to be on my bad side, Ive just proven them wrong. =) I get so upset when confronted that I just sit here with my hands shaking so badly I can hardly type hehehe<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzarshaeshaedee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarshae ShaeDee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/1/00 1:10:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Joeler</span><hr size=1> Indeed a sorry tale.

Actions have been taken.<br>And I just got word from her brother, that Joeler will not be adventuring in Norrath for a very long time. <br>It seems she is having trouble finding a group now.<br>Her other character Penasite however, is another story and I must get word out to everyone on that one. My high council and myself will be in touch with Kemidra in game to give an in character apology to her and make sure that proper restitution is made.<br>The Oracles of Fate were forged in the fiery pits of honor and dignity.

Because I was having problems with locking up when zoning and due to the fact this was an out of the way request, I requested payment of 20pp, and payment up front.  They kept insisting they would pay after port (note: I normally will port folks for free, but this time I really needed the cash).<br><br>They insisted they would wait at the ring if I had to reboot when I zoned.  Well, I zoned, and locked up as I expected, when I get back on Joeler, is not there, I send them a tell and they are in EC, and tell me to 'come to the tunnel if I want my payment'.<br><br>While its not a big deal, it shows that they are not a person of their word, and its made me decide to stop porting people that I do not already know through having grouped with, or assisted.  Likewise, no longer will my enchanter be handing out free crack, and when my cleric can res, that too will be restricted to known people.<br><br>It is people like Joeler that ruin the game for us all.
