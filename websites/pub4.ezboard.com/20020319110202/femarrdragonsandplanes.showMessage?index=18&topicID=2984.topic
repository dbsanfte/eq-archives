The only train I saw called was the FD one that ended in like 2 mobs.  Was no big deal, was just the 3rd time in as many minutes.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I haven't sat around saying how much I hate LoR or any other thing, but being my first real run in with any one group of you, sure it's going to be what I remember until I have a different experience.<br>
<br>
My only point other than that is that it's not hard to give some kind of warning.  I had six+ mobs on me when I stopped in front of Afflction, said &quot;watch out guys&quot;, and pulled them past them until I had to zone.<br>
<br>
Sure, I could have run right past them, and maybe they didn't need the warning, because they killed that particular train, but I know from my conversations with them that the courtesy was noted and appreciated.<br>
<br>
I'd have done it even if it meant me dying right there.  I had a cleric right there to rez me back in, so it was no skin off of my nose, but instead of enveloping them in a shitstorm, I took a second just to give a heads up.  <br>
<br>

<br>
    I am not going to flame on anyone.  If hatred exist let those that have it worry about it.  I have seen many people come and go, the same holds true with Guilds.  That said, remember that real folks play this game.  The heart and soul behind any character is a real person.  Before we decide to jump on a band wagon let us be slow to anger.  I don't blame anyone or fault them.  I will leave that judgement to a higher power, one that has authority to do so.<br>
<br>
    Instead, I think that there are many avenues to approach any conflict.  One way to accomplish this was done by Suh.  He openly offered a forum that would air concerns to be considered.  To vent and flame on someone that you may not know is pure stupidity.  I read the post, it was an honest approach.  If you plan to fix a problem, you have to know that it exist.  I think that he at least tried to find out what it was.  Do we condemn a man for trying to do the right thing?  Or perhaps could we offer him an ear and maybe some helpful advice?  If we only offer negative feedback, or we any better than the issue?  Perhaps we could rise all learn a lesson with this.<br>
<br>
    Suh, it takes time to get a car finely tuned.  Once you have it race ready it will do exactly what you desire.  Working out the kinks is a good way to start.   Take things as they are.  These are only opinions from people.  Continue doing what you think is best, that is a mark of someone to follow.  Conviction is never easy to understand until the rest of the folks see the big picture.  I offer you no advice.  I have not heard of any such hatred.  However, I applaud your effort to trying to fix a problem.<br>
<br>
    Perhaps what you view as hatred from others may very well be jealously or envy.  I have to agree that your guild has done more than others in record time.  This is something to admire, not hate.  And I have seen other Guilds join you in mulitple raids.  This is not a sign of a power hungry person.  I have also seen many of your folks grouped together doing alot of different things.  What I have observed certainly does not justify what I have read within this thread.  <br>
<br>
    Past all of this, I think your idea of a Guild is novel.  Your approach may be different than others are used to.  This should not make enemies.  This should create friends for you and others to come to the table with.  Offering experience from each others past is a resource not to be put aside.  The mark of a good player is their ability to rise above an issue to solve the problem.  Maybe, it is the very people that knock you who have the problem.  Rather they have personal issues or just gaming issues.  Take this as a duck does to water.  Let it go, just as a duck allows rain water to run down its back.<br>
<br>
    If you raid, and others have agreed to the conditions of loot distrubition.  Then there can be no objections to it.  If they did not win due to a random roll that is just luck.  However, to hate a Guild solely on something like this is childish.  Ask any veteran player.  It takes months sometimes to get an item.  Patience and fortitude are necessary to getting anything worthwhile.  To expect every loot to go your way isn't reasonable.  The mature method to this is simple.  You make a goal, then you go to the zone until you get it.  This may take time, so pack a lunch.  Once you have the desired item you will have accomplished a great ordeal.<br>
<br>
   For now, I leave you with this one thought.  <br>
<br>
    If any enemy approaches, what do I do?  Do I use the sword to dispatch him?  Or do I treat him as my brother and shower upon him gifts and honors?  Surely, by making him my brother he will no longer my enemy.  Therefore I am stronger for the effort.<br>

As far as I know, no one in PC hates LoR. But I must admit it gets tiring to see PC getting blamed for actions that are pretty despicable and highly unlikely.<br>
<br>
PC member trained CoV faction mobs on LoR over a scout spawn conflict. (I was online when I heard my guildies surprise to find the tools turned in and captain walked over them at charrissa without warning.) (btw, that is a bad place to fight, wanderers) (and possible chain aggro) (Is it not also possible that a KoS member picked up the aggro when he was out hunting dragons and picked up aggro while coming in?) blame the fat guy, eh? /nudge Zeno. That was just a F'd up situation and it was sad to see people pointing fingers. Even after PC left the captain alone and offered to help rez.<br>
<br>
PC tried to KS Lodizal. (Lodizal is a race of force, 1st people to engage the mob with resonable force gets the kill) (80-90% of PC didn't even engage. The 10-20% that was on it was not likely grouped together and backed off within 5-10 seconds after hearing confirmation that it wasn't PC's mob.)<br>
<br>
Both are pretty gross accusations and I can understand if people get upset by them. To me, they are just situation that got blown way out of proportion. I pesonally hold no grudge what-so-ever against LoR, I just wish some members were a little less quick in judgement and even slower with the finger pointing. I have grouped with many of you before and after these incidents without ever giving it a second thought.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, I was one of the 10-20% that had engaged the mob and backed off when I got confirmation that it wasn't PC that had first engaged the mob. If by some miracle, we had KS'd it, I don't think any of our members would have looted it without straightening out who it belonged to first.<br>

<br>
Yes, I was in velks on the infamous night.  <br>
<br>
I was in a ledge group with several other members of Chaotic Delusions, you can verify this with Iizzard, Rexfel or Aziline.  Zarukami who isn't in our guild  was also there and a friend of mine.  In the previous three hours before the 'Tymex comment' we had two members of League of Ronin join our group and leave us on a moments notice.  (I would have kept their names but I didn't know this was gonna be a cry fest).<br>
<br>
Now, having a shaman leave ledge group w/o waiting for a replacement or giving any warning ain't that big of a deal but its annoying as hell.  So...when Tymex made a comment about Munji or whatever her name is, I simply said /ooc well thats League of Ronin for ya.<br>
Banisher (whom I've known awhile and think of as a good friend) understandably said /ooc wtf? or something like that.  To which I gave a '<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ' to show that I was saying said comment in jest.  (because honestly pal, I don't hold an entire gulid responsible for something a couple people do).<br>
 <br>
About five minutes later I get a tell from Tokum (our guild leader) asking me what was going on.  I told him I cracked a joke about LoR, and would refrain in the future.<br>
<br>
So Mr. LoR guild leader, we already took your advice.  You advised my guild leader of the situation, he sent me a tell we got it resolved.  I haven't made any  public comments  about your guild since.  However, resolving the issue by the terms you stated in your first post is not enough for you, you still flamed us and won't let it go.<br>
<br>
Your real problem lies in the fact that some of your guild members are in fact flakes and giving the rest of you a bad name.  There are LOTS of people in LoR that I consider friends.  But you have some real bad apples in your guild.  YOU have given them your name and YOU don't take responsibilty for their actions.  You flamed my whole guild for something I did, yet when people in YOUR guild screw up you won't accept it.<br>
<br>
What you need to do is take your own advice, and look into these matters BEFORE you do something so stupid and post it here.   Good god man, if you read your first post you'd see the horrific amount of hypocracy  you've displayed.<br>

However i would like to say that the matter had been delt with as soon as i got a tell from Parra.<br>
If any1 ever has a problem with any members of CD at any time i am normally on and expect a tell to inform me. I would like to keep CD's rep on Emarr a good one and can only do that if i know when one of our members is havin a problem, feel free to talk to me anytime.<br>
<br>
ps: for the record CD has absolutly no problems with LoR to date, a few of your members have reflected poorly on you and i hope u can solve the problems you are havin in guild, keep in touch guys and hope the wrong perceptions have not been gathered from this post even tho i feel they probally allrdy have.<br>

In several instances people say that there have been several people in LoR that have impaacted and given the guild a bad rep. Yet in just about all these cases you fail to point out who those people are. Now i'm sure quite a few of you are not putting any names simply not to accuse that person/s wrongly incase you are wrong. I can see some justice in that but if you are going to make the point at all in the first place that people in LoR have been giving them a bad rep why not tell them who those people are so that they can fix the problem eh? That would be more help than just posting how &quot;its not my guilds fault. Maybe its those people in your guild that have been giving you guys a bad name.&quot; And i dont mean just post so and so is the one giving you a bad name, give them specifics so that they know your not just busting someones chops because you have a vendetta against them. That way the issue can be resolved and all can get on with their lives and just play the game. Its a GAME. It was created so that people could have some fun. Arguing with other people is not my idea of fun as i am sure most of you don't enjoy it either. Therefore if you think the problom is with LoR members then point out those troublesome members for them and what they have done (with some decent evidence, not just idle accusation) so that the matter at hand can be put to a rest.<br>

We think and use refrain before we post.  Ok..example of someone who may be causing problems for LoR..well lets start with the cleric who gates on a pit group in velks with no warning and leaves his group dangling.  That's a problem child.  Why isn't his name here?  Becuase Tymex is a class act who refused to bring the poor sap's name to the boards and destroy any rep that he may have had.<br>
