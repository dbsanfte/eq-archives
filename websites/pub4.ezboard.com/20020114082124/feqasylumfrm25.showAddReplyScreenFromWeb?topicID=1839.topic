Wow, 66 people.  Let me tell you I was still shaking hours after the whole thing had finished.  That was a LOT more pressure than I had expected.  As many of you know it was my first major raid (anything more than a 2 grouper on Phinnigal or guild fun day).  I have to say I really enjoyed it, I love the pressure.  <br>
<br>
Firstly, a raid is only good/successful if all the people that turn up work hard.  For that I want to thank every one of you that came, coz we could not have done it without you.  Well ok, we could have done it with less people yes, but I am still very greatful that you all came.<br>
<br>
The raid went a loooooong time, that is no exageration.  We had not even started by 3.5 hours after the meeting time.  I apologise for that, 66 people are a lot of people to organise.  I did not want to restrict the numbers because naggy is such a long spawn (7 days) but in future I will limit numbers because it is simply not fair to everyone that attends.  My goal is actually Naggy down, loot distributed in under 2 hours with 20 people - but give me some time on that one :)<br>
<br>
I had intended to break people into groups of same class for buffing then into proper raid groups.  But it seems that if people are not practiced at this, it can take too long to do.  In future will set groups up then buff them as they are.<br>
<br>
2 x orbs of Tishan - woot, some NICE sticks that I would love to have - effect tashania.  Grats Gloomx and Gorgaron.<br>
Gaunts fiery might - grats Ashtoroth I believe.<br>
Gold Plated Koshigatana - grats to the winner, didn't record that one.<br>
Mithril arms - nice work Daihing<br>
Prayers of life - grats Beaumont I believe<br>
Crown (cash item) - nice work Cazzinia.  If you know what this crown is for (can't remember proper name, but all all no stats) then let us know below.  Cazz did not sell it in case someone could use it.<br>
Jacinth - Abzsu<br>
Words of Bondage, icon is a playing card.  I still have this.  Mages use a words of bondage for their 49 pet so Aethimyr or Rommulus if you can use them, let me know.  I'll keep an eye out in game.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know who Macaroni was, standing invis in the corner in the buff room?<br>
<br>
The Raggie part of this raid did not go ahead which was expected.  As he is random and can take a long time to spawn.<br>
<br>
Special thanks to Jackii for some marvellous FG pulling, and for getting the whole thing inzone happening.  Tusslefoot, I could not have done it without you.  Kaithlar thanks for the buffs and I am sorry to hear you did not manage to hold your naggy camp (decided to entertain the other 3 monks that were also FD in the lair by singing '99 bottles on the wall"... 9 is his key to stand hehehhe better luck next time.  Hope I can come and help).  Uladar, thanks for recruiting the clerics and doing all the ports.  I am sorry the nice druid stick did not drop this time, but it will at the next one I promise.  Thanks to those others that got the few (5) clerics along, we can't live without you.  Next time I'll hand out peridots before the raid, saves me trying to chase you up the next day - my mistake.   Citric and everyone else that helped the whole thing along - big thanks.<br>
<br>
---END DEBRIEFING<br>
<br>
We are close to having enough people, we just do not have all the right classes.  We must have the following as well before it can go ahead.<br>
<br>
AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE A LITTLE SHORT ON THE FOLLOWING CLASSES<br>
Clerics x 6<br>
Chanters x 2<br>
Shammies x 1<br>
Wizzies/mages x 5 (got 2 so far)<br>
<br>
This is nothing new, but would you mind checking out your friendly casters listed above to see if they would like to come.  It would be handy if they could sign up before the raid to save finding and porting them in on the day.  We'll get them either way, just more efficient if we can snare them upfront.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Hi all.  I will be organising a raid on Lord Nagafen and Ragefire on Saturday 5/Jan/02 at 1700 PST (Sun 1200 Sydney time) (to clarify that is Jan 5 2002 not Jan 2nd).  The plan is to take out Naggy and then camp Ragefire (who can take up to 18 hours to spawn).  <br>
<br>
I am after the red scale for my [bard] epic, however with the Naggy raid there is no loot defaulted (NBG of course), therefore I will roll with the rest of the angry mob.  However with Ragefire the cleric that spawns him gets the cleric item.  At this stage it is intended that Ronitune will spawn him, however I am very open to letting someone else take that spot.  Post below your details and reasons.  I will post a list of loot and how I believe it should be rolled in the next few days.<br>
<br>
PLEASE NOTE - It is frustrating to see the spam that happens after an epic battle with a dragon such as this. Some nice things WILL drop, and some people will end up with some ubber gear, most of us will not.  However one thing is for certain, we cannot do it without several groups so please come - but come with the intention of having an epic battle, and adventure and some satsifying fun.  If you win, then walk away with some REALLY nice stuff.<br>
<br>
The Lavastorm rings are the best place to meet, time being 1700 US PST on 5/Jan/02.  Depending on who shows up we will need a minimum of 20 people, up to however many wish to join (I don't particularly like closed raids, however if too many wish to come it will just get messy).<br>
<br>
If you are 53+ and are interested I am sure something can be worked out with the fire giants and Ragefire, and perhaps even Naggy depending on your class.  High level clerics and shammies are particularly good for obvious reasons, and with Naltron's Mark over Symbol it will save a LOT of peridots.  A high level FD puller for FG's would be great too, even if you just hang around for the giants.  In any case if you have FD and would be interested in pulling, please indicate so here (even if under 53, we'll need one either way).<br>
<br>
Otherwise the soft level requirements are 45 to 52.  High fire and magic resists are necessary.  +80 unbuffed for both is optimal, however you can get away with less depending on the group makeup and your level.  If you are struggling with resists then speak to a kind shammy and get hold of some greater Null and cold potions to give you that extra +25 resist (costs around 45p each shot.  If you will have such potions for sale on the day please indicate here).<br>
<br>
It would be very helpful if a Mage with CoH would be available to bind nearby the lair.  I have a mage in mind however availability is not certain.  If you can fill this spot please post below.  The mage would be a normal part of the raid and welcome to join in on any rolls.  Their help with the FG's will be much appreciated, plus they can help out with CoH during the Naggy battle, help with assembling peeps with Ragefire and of course virtually solo Raggie :)     The binding and CoH for Raggie is quite an imposition so I don't expect this to happen, looks like we'll have to fight our way through again.<br>
<br>
If you are one of those big fat ugly ogres/trolls then see if you can organise yourself a shrink, it is bad enough having to look at you at all, let aloeg as large as life :)     <br>
<br>
---<br>
After grouping up at LS rings (groups may change for actual meeting with Naggy) we will make our way according to the linked map<br>
<br>
(copy and paste this first link)<br>
http://www25.brinkster.com/victusfortis/images/nagafenslair.gif<br>
<br>
Thanks to muse at <br>
http://www.eqatlas.com/<br>
for the initial map that I scribbled on, which is located here<br>
http://www.eqatlas.com/nagafenslairmap.html<br>
<br>
At the reassemble point "the lava" we will stop and make sure all members are present.  You will need lev to run over the lava past this point.  A scout with FD will run ahead to check if clear and we will fight at the next stop.  After clearing the area we can make a way through as per the map.<br>
<br>
You can buy FR +5 earrings at the gypsies in LS just south of the rings for around 26p each.<br>
<br>
On the day I will designate crowd controllers for the FG's.  They cannot be mezzed, however they can be charmed.  Those that can charm will get the first adds, any additional adds should be agroed by a hybrid with root and taken away from the fight and rooted there.  This may not work as planned, but is the intention.  (Anyone had trouble rooting them?).<br>
<br>
If you can bind yourself in the lair and don't mind doing so, then please bind at the spot located on the map.  Make sure that you don't bind in the agro range of any FG's in case you have LD problems on the day and cannot come back in time, or alternatively you forget to rebind yourself outside hehehe.  I know you have all forgotten to do so at some remote time in your glorious pasts :)     <br>
<br>
It is intended that, depending on numbers only standard fighting buffs from within your group will be carried out at the LS rings.  Real buffs will happen at the buffing point inside.<br>
<br>
Ideally 4 fake buffs would be good (for he mass dispells) in the following order -<br>
1 - see invis (longer lasting buff would be better, please suggest)<br>
2- resist disease<br>
3- resist poison<br>
4- resist cold<br>
<br>
Druids/lower level clerics can do these.<br>
<br>
with fakes up dispelling should not be an issue unless we only have a small number of people.  HOwever if you have a bard in your group and you get dispelled too many times (you lose all your fakes) make sure you click off the flashing bard buffs so that next time they cycle (up to 12 seconds later prolly) they fill the first spot and get dispelled recast each tiem.  You can also call for another fake from your group.  This is why I have suggested an order for fakes, so that person can keep up that one fake (eg see invis) and cast when needed.<br>
<br>
Next mellee steroids and brain buffs, then HP buffs then resist buffs.<br>
<br>
HP buffs should include cleric HB or similar, symbol and AC and also the 2 shammy buffs.  Please don't ask for more buffs than you need, coz it will only make the raid take longer.  Also keep in mind that you need those MR/FR buffs, so keep enough slots open for them.<br>
<br>
Lastly resistance buffs.  These include<br>
Resist magic (hopefully chanter GMR)<br>
Greater Null potion (shammy made resist mag potion +25)<br>
Resist Fire (or better still circle of winter if we can convince a nice very high level druid to help out).<br>
Resist fire potion<br>
Mage fire DS (which will include FR component as well).<br>
Bard songs which up Mag/FR and also Mag resist.<br>
<br>
Shammies and clerics are under lots of mana pressure during buffs so for shammy would like a standby healer so shammy can convert HP to mana.  A twitch would be good too if we are lucky enough to have a necro along.<br>
<br>
Necros please steer clear of the cool "change to skellie form" spell as it can make life difficult in these intense times.  (Come on, we know you are itching to solo him, just give us a break :)     .<br>
<br>
Make sure you stay by your group leader in one area so you are easy to find.  This is really important, yet .......<br>
<br>
I will bring a bundle of peridots for the enchanters and clerics.  However I ask that if you receive a nice item, you help cover the costs of the peridots (they are 11p each about).  Either bring some peridots or some plat.  <br>
<br>
Don't let naggy fall into lava or press against wall.  If this happens a command will be given to move back to original fighting area, please do so quickly.<br>
<br>
You will need levitation to get over the lava area as indicated on the map.  This will be cast either at LS rings or reassembly point.  Please make sure you have a lev.  Talk to your group leader if you don't.<br>
<br>
Don't move ahead of person designated as "person not to move ahead of"<br>
<br>
If you have complaints/suggestions whilst on the raid send tell to me (Lunitune).  There are always ways to do it better, but we may already be committed to a particular way.<br>
<br>
Healers heal from around the corner at the Assemble point.  This way you avoid the AoE blasts (until you get summoned :)     .<br>
<br>
If you have the new agro management spells from Luclin (chanters) please let us know here, and also how they work.  I understand they work as a short duration buff that lasts 12 seconds and has a recast time of 24 seconds.  We'll have to see how many chanters turn up before we know whether to use this.<br>
<br>
Ideally it would be good to have one chanter help the MA up the agro list if we know we are going to be able to keep the MA alive, and another chanter keep the healers/debuffers down on the list.  This in addition to mana seiving duties of course.  A chanter's work is never done :)       CoH from high level mage will also be good here to clear agro list of debuffers and healers.<br>
<br>
Naggy fears, so please turn off run before we start to attack him.<br>
<br>
This is of course a complex plan with the possibility of not finishing as intended, however I would like to run with it as far as possible.<br>
<br>
This post will be updated regularly so please visit regularly if you are interested.  I will make sure Naggy is up the day before and also a couple of hours before, and will indicate here if the raid has to be postponed.  In the absence of a notice of postponement here, please assume the raid will go ahead.<br>
<br>
If you are interested and can possibly make it, please note it here, even if tentative. Equally importantly, if you have to withdraw (which happens to the best of us) please indicate so here.  The more we know here on the drawing board, the faster and smoother the raid will be.<br>
<br>
---<br>
RAGGIE PLAN<br>
This is a little more sketchy as we don't know when he will spawn.  The cleric for whom Raggie will be spawned is Ronitune but as stated above I am open to letting someone else spawn him if they are more ready for him.<br>
<br>
If we can get a CoH mage to bind inside, Raggie will be relatively easy.  We can CoH in the group members, clear the couple of FG's that will be in our way, buff up as above and fight Raggie.  A wizard (Taallon) will be bound inside the lair and able port/invite peeps so that they can be CoH'd to the lair.  I don't think this is going to happen though, so may end up having to fight through FG's again.<br>
<br>
If we can't get a kind mage to do that for us, then we'll have to fights our way to the lair again as per above.  This should be much easier though as there is no level cap for Raggie.<br>
<br>
Here's to a successful raid, not by my making, but by the cooperation of all of the people who put the time aside to join us.<br>

NAGGY LOOT (Unfinished)<br>
If you already have the item please be honest and don't ask to roll on it.  If you have a similar item and would like to upgrade, I think everyone at the raid would appreciate it if you offered your old item up for grabs.  This is not expected though.<br>
<br>
Treasure Hunter's Satchel 100% weight reduction bag (all/all) this pains me greatly to do this with such a nice item, but I feel it should go to the monks only.<br>
Red scale Bard/War epic so only they can roll.  After much thought I have decided not to add a second roll to lev 52's.  This is because the red scale can be found from many sources post 52, and with alt adv points enabled at 51 via Luclin, one can if one chooses not level past 52 without losing out.  I am not however bound to this if you guys want to put a good argument forward :)<br>
Selo's drums of the march (bard only)<br>
Gaunts of fiery might (mellee types only including hybrids)<br>
Coat of flames (mellee types only including hybrids)<br>
Heirophant's crook (druid only)<br>
Bladestopper (mellees)<br>
Blight, Hammer of the Scourge (shammies only)<br>
Red Dragon Tooth (all/all) may not drop anymore.  I am thinking that as it summons a necro pet, perhaps necros need not have one.<br>
Gold Plated Koshigatana (those that can use)<br>
Orb of Tishan (very nice item - those that can use)<br>
Prayers of Life (all/all)<br>
Book of scale (pally epic)?<br>

If you are to be the one that will spawn him then you camp there until he spawns if you want to make sure we get him when he spawns (basically as soon as he spawns several guilds head straight in to claim him).<br>

Depending on how things pan out, there will prolly be a wizard bound there too in case you decide you need to get out (and the FG's have respawned (8 hours)). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upimm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pimm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/01 3:13:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oppz</span><hr size=1> (This message was left blank) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/upimm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pimm</A> at: 12/28/01 3:14:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usunlight1986.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sunlight1986</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/01 3:16:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy and Ragefire Jan 5 2002 at 1700 PST</span><hr size=1> Hey sorry i forgot that im going on a chardok royals raid on the 5th so i cant come there for naggy but i can be there for ragefire if im online so look me im really sorry <p><img src=http://members.home.net/eldae69/tylorsig.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulunitune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lunitune</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/lunitune60x60.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/01 3:23:36 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/staff/graham.hannah/eq/resources/lunitune60x60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy and Ragefire Jan 5 2002 at 1700 PST</span><hr size=1> Hi there Taylor.  I believe that you were the one sending tells in game regarding bringing friends on the naggy raid for a roll on the scale.<br>
<br>
I don't think many people would be very happy about that, because it would be in essence the same as say giving a druid the chance to roll on the red scale.  However I can see where you are coming from, esp if you were there to help out with the FG's.  In any case I'll say no to you/your friends rolling on the scale if you (being over 52) can't make the naggy raid.  However, if you are able to make the Raggie one then you are most entitled to roll, that is your right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uillumine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>illumine</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://shaftware.home.mindspring.com/mogicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(12/28/01 8:34:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://shaftware.home.mindspring.com/mogicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Naggy and Ragefire Jan 5 2002 at 1700 PST</span><hr size=1> Yep Yep, I'm in there like swimwear :)<br>
