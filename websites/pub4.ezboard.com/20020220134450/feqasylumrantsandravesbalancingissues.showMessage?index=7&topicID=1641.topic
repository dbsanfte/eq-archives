Come 5pm PST there are still a good number of &quot;bosses&quot; up between Velious and Luclin on Lanys.  Also we don't seem to have as strong euro/asian guilds here as on other servers.  There was actually a very good rant about this on Lagacy of Steel's webpage, it might still be there. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net">www.legacyofsteel.net</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
One solution are randomizing spawn times.  This can be very frustrating on two fronts, 1 is for those who have a rotation, the other is for raids/guilds who need a large amount of time to plan something.  Right now, due to the amount of emerging 'casual gamers' along with SoL abilities and spells, there are a good number of boss mobs that can be taken down with the right leader.  Doze, CT, Vindi, Statue, Rhags could all probably be taken out by open raids.  The problem is that these open raids require a week or two to plan.  If the spawn timer in random, it's very difficult for the casual gamer to perhaps get a chance at one of these.  Yes, these are all pretty much dead on a patch day, but if you plan a raid for let's say 2 weeks after a patch, you have a fairly good shot at having the forces avalible and ready to get the mob.  I think randomizing spawn times would only hurt the casual gamer, and frustrate the power gamers.<br>
<br>
Another option, would be to increase spawn times.  As EQ ages and more players come into the &quot;end game&quot; another way to give everyone a chance at the mobs would to be to have them spawn more often.  The flip side to this is, if boss mobs spawn more often, loot enters the server more often, a lot of the aura of having it is lost.<br>
<br>
A third option is more content.  There is still a bunch of content in SoL that has yet to be unlocked.  Depending on the fights/rewards, you might find uber guilds pretty much leaving Velious all together as more of it's unlocked.  But right now since a lot of it is still a.)being discoverd b.)bugged or c.)not implemented yet, the content we do have avalible is becoming more crowded.  Perhaps we need another Velious type expansion next. <p><center><img src="http://merkabaeq.homestead.com/files/merky.jpg"><br>

There is a pretty steep learning curve for up and coming guilds in EQ.  They start out being able to put plane of hate/fear on the calendar, then even Venril Sathir or Trakanon.  Once they are ready to start farming TOV for armor, they again look to the calendar and get upset when people tell them their days of reserving things to do are pretty much over.  Lanys turns into the wild wild west pretty much after you're done with the planes.<br>

To get off topic here a bit... Merkaba are you insane? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I think of this list MAYBE the first Rhag could be taken down by an open raid.  I think you have been casting complete heal after someone all night a little too long to realize exactly what an open raid is capable of.  I invite you to plan an open raid on Vindi or Dozer to prove me wrong.  Hell, Vindi is up every single day, if you plan him on a day without Statue I'm sure you could get cooporation to get an open raid in there for a few tries, see what happens.  Everyone knows what to do, you take a warrior, give him a good amont of time to fight by himself before others engage, and cast the CH's in order.  What could go wrong?<br>

This comes to light very easily when you use last week as an example.<br>
<br>
Last week there was no patch.  Anyone notice?<br>
<br>
I personally had to cancel a planar raid, because a mob was up, and an unnamed guild said they couldn't wouldn't wait for my guild to finish.  I knew what was happening.  Other guilds who will also remain nameless, but have a much more common reputation for doing it, had done it to us before.    Rather than have X guild run me over, and flex its muscles, I avoided the pain of a CR, and more complaints and name calling, and bowed down.  <br>
<br>
Apparently, respect is something Lanys doesn't have.  Guilds helping each other?  Not a chance, the big guilds have the maturity of a 10 year old when it comes to their spawns if you are in their way.  They have fine people, but if X mob is up, it's their god given right.  <br>
<br>
There's always a bigger fish.  Its a stupid line but its true.  If Visions leaves NToV FL will compete with ROTA over it.  Where one guild was the casual gamers, they quickly realize that they MUST have loot.  They deserve it, and they will do it.  You can argue they are more organized.  That they have better people.  And they do in some ways, if you can get the loot being an asshole, you can be better equipped, thats Real Life too.  It's the American way.<br>
<br>
It's a game.  You want to be an ass to others and that's what floats your boat fine.  You want to help others, group and have fun?  Do it.  The problem is that unfortunately those that fall in the second category will never see the cool stuff, and I'm one of them.  Even tho, I have every confidence that my guild can take down Cazic Thule, I know that until every other ass guild gets their Cazic loot, mine will not.  Because we aren't the ones who will walk into Fear and claim it.  It's FFA but we don't ignore the calendar.<br>
<br>
Verant can fix spawn timers.  It can't fix players. <p><center>

<br>
I guess I could be called a casual gamer, although I have spent whole weekends playing.  I have a job and can only play a couple hours at night if that.  Lately I have been working Saturdays too.<br>
<br>
The player base of any server is a creature that from the exact moment of creation of a server, becomes a critical mass gaining momentum, day after day, until eventually all fairly regular players have a level 60.  What is Verant going to do about this?  Probably nothing.  What can they do?  More expansions?  With SWOG coming out within the next two years, I am sure their priority is not to keep this game running full steam.<br>
<br>
I see someone say they are going to do something about twinking.  What can they do about that?  All it does is punish everyone who doesn’t already have a level 50 or so character and who has not had a chance to farm like the rest. Most people have twinked the hell out of their alts now if they have a level 50 character.  It is not uncommon to see a level 6 character in gear that should be for level 45 and above.<br>

<br>
I think randomizing the spawn times would cut down on the uberguild competition somewhat, but wouldnt do a thing for the more casual players.<br>
<br>
The problem is, on the day of the patch, the uberguilds run around with &quot;priorities&quot; of what to do first, based on the loot they want to get (or the loot they dont want their &quot;competition&quot; to get).<br>
<br>
After a day or 2, they are basically sitting on their butts, because everything is dead.<br>
<br>
If you randomize the loot, you space it out more, sure, but the uber guilds will generally have more people online than casual guilds ( even casual guilds with power ...), and will tend to mobilize faster than casual guilds.  <br>
<br>
Spacing it out, means that the uber guilds have a shot at killing EVERYTHING.  Leaving it the way it is, means that they cant be in more than one place at the same time, so around patch day usually SOMETHING is available.<br>
<br>
I wish i had an answer for it, but i dont.  It sort of becomes a ' when in rome, do as the romans do&quot;type of thing.  Unfortunately, unless the server set up some sort of rotation ( which , due to the style of players we have here, i dont see happening ), even casual guilds have to &quot;play like the big boys&quot;, if they want to do anything.<br>
<br>
I agree with the original poster quite a bit, but dont have any ideas of how to fix it with the current game engine.<br>

I say this from a semi-casual gamer's perspective.  I play weird hours.  I'm likely to play prime time one night, and early A.M. the next.  I accept the fact that this will, at times, limit the content available to me.  If I want to see content that gets WTFowned during prime time, well, I guess I better play prime time.  The only limitation to the content available to me is one I set myself.  Fault lies with no one else.  Its the same for everyone.  You set your play time and hours.  Live with it.<br>

<br>
50,000 to 5,000,000 pp buys you a guild hall, in a special zone created for the purpose. This would have entry restricted by guild (e.g. a teleporter that won't work unless you have the right guild tag).<br>
<br>
In the guid hall there would be some special NPCs, such as guild bankers, guild-only merchants, and, the key thing, guild-only quest NPCs.<br>
<br>
Some of those NPCs would effectively be triggers for epic encounters:<br>
<br>
/say 'I want to visit the Plane of Spicy Food'<br>
/say 'I challenge Rogan Josh'<br>
<br>
Some of these would work at any time, the best risk/reward ones would be triggerrable once a week or less. For the affected zones, you simply couldn't enter if another guild was already there.<br>
<br>
Buying a better guild hall would get you some extra NPCs. Others would require quests to activate ('I will gather the components you need to cast the summoning spell'). <br>
<br>
This allows each guild to progress in power independantly, without the risk of having all of the spawns they need taken by a guild further along the power ladder.<br>

It's a nice idea, but it won't happen, and I very seriously doubt will help.<br>

Most patches end at more like 12pm PST anyway, not 5am. <p>Harabec Woodwalker<br>

My main character(see name above heh) is only a 45th enchanter and i've owned EQ for over a year and a half now.  I've only logged 18 days played time.  It doesn't really bother me much that i won't see all the excellent loot that some of these other guild probably hand out amongst themselves.  But the idea of 3000 lvl 60's running around does, especially with the new AA's out i would imagine alot more will be running around trying to earn AA points now.  <br>
<br>
         Possible solution might be to allow the transfer of characters(50+) to a new Extremely high-end game.  Maybe there it would be possible to get over 60th level.  But of course once they switch over they won't ever be able to come back. Anyone have any other ideas? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showPrevMessage?topicID=1641.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showNextMessage?topicID=1641.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1641.topic&index=31><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/bluesparty/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.emailToFriend?topicID=1641.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.threadControl?topicID=1641.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1641.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1641.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues>Rants and Raves </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
