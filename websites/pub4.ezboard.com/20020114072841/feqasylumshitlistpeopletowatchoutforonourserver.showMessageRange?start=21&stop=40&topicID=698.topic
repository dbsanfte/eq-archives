A post here means that the said player should be avoided at all costs, as they have proven themselves to be dishonorable. Please make every attempt to resolve the issue with the player's guild, the player's friends, the player, etc., before posting here. Please treat this as a last resort.&quot;<br>
<br>
From the front page of the SL.<br>
<br>
While not numbered, this is definitely included in the moderators directions for posting to the SL.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to make light of his despicable actions, nor the severity of his abusing his presence in the raid party. My statement was simply that this post did not meet the above qualification. <br>
<br>
Yes, we should all be made aware of players such as this one. Zulander makes a good point also. By accepting an unknown player in a raid party the leader must also accept the possibility that player will abuse the opportunity. <br>
<br>
The point I attempted to make is still valid. Posting an individual should be a last resort. Posting an individual should only be done after following the rules and instructions laid out by the moderators.<br>
If the guild takes no action that is a point of information I'm sure we would all be interested in. Regardless whether the guild takes action or not, the player can still be posted. Such posting should only be done after all the other instructions have been followed. I personally would much rather see a post such as this contain information on the response of the players guild. <br>
<br>
Take it for what it's worth. My opinion.<br>

Even if Deris were to contact the guildleader and the guildleader talked Cata into MQing it with Deris, he would STILL belong here for ninjaing, gating, and /qing.<br>
<br>
There is no other side of the story to be heard here (unless you doubt that Deris is telling the truth, and we have already heard from someone else on the raid).  There is no possible misunderstanding.  This is a clearcut case and in that regard shitlisting could be called the ONLY resort.<br>
<br>
Of course the guildleader should also be notified of these actions and this posting, and I would hope that he/she would subsequently boot cata from the guild for it.  If not, the handling of the situation by the guild would also definitely be a pertinent bit of info to post here -- but it would do nothing to resolve the problem.  The only resolution is 1. GMs take the BP from cata and give it to Deris (and Deris has already initiated this course of action), 2. Cataclyzmic is shitlisted so that everyone knows what he has done and (hopefully) he is never allowed on another raid again.<br>

And I'm also sorry if this get's to be a bit long. To begin with, as soon as I see Cataclyzmic, I assure you, he will no longer be a member of my guild. A guild as small as mine cannot stand to have a bad reputation.<br>
<br>
As is mandatory with people I invite into a guild this small, I get to know them first. When I told Cat I wished to group with him in DL for a while, he didn't have a problem. He usually just sat there and PL'd himself with his 52 cleric off of his other account. I have plenty of log to back up that this other character is indeed him.<br>
<br>
[52 Cleric] Pheramone &lt;Riders of the Apocalypse&gt;<br>
<br>
While my guild is in no position at all to restore the item (we just don't have the money/ability) I figured I could at least warn you of his alt.<br>
<br>
If there is ANYTHING at all I can do, don't hesitate to contact me in game (I'm on every night from 8pmEST-4amEST) <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/dragonsofluclin/tringle.bmp"><br>

<br>
Seeing how Cata and Pheramone are the same person and was also on that kael raid..and had a problem with the 1 peice rule..This finally makes sense now..<br>
<br>
I spoke with Cata today and he layed down some story about how my guild was doing Kael and they screwed him out of kael robe,and ninja looted my bp out of revenge.<br>
<br>
I also offered him several times to simply MQ the BP with me,and said I would drop this post and petition to GM Jannakka.He told me no..The GM's will deal with him now,and will not show as much patience as I did.<br>
<br>
[52 Cleric] Pheramone &lt;Riders of the Apocalypse&gt; = Cataclyzmic.Both of these characters are played by the same person and are at fault for the ninja looting of the plate BP.Only,Cataclyzmic was set up to carry the blame..Now Pheramone is also responsible and will share the same punishment as Cataclyzmic.<br>
<br>
However,when I spoke to my guild leader and officers today about this..they recalled no sort of situation.TaH has never seen a kael robe drop..It was a lie.<br>
<br>
What does this mean?<br>
<br>
Cataclyzmic/Pheramone sacraficed cata's reputation to obtain a kael bp for thier main (pheramone).<br>
<br>
Pheramone was a good cleric and did a good job..but I have lost all respect for the player behind the character now.This was obviously a well planned-ninja looting.Please keep an eye out for Pheramone wearing a Thurg quest bp..If she has one on,then that is the one she ninja looted and stole from my raid.I assume she already has it..and used to robe excuse to distract me today.<br>
<br>
Pheramone also won a book of stategy on my raid over several monks..This sickens me.<br>
<br>
I will talk to Errtai or Simc soon,seeing how Pheramone is in RoTA,and inform Jannaka that two characters on two seperate accounts (played by the same person) were responsible for this action. <p><br>

<br>
We have now asked her to please post her side of the story here before we take further action..however should she not do that then ROA will have no other choice then to assume she is lieing as she did not respond and remove her.<br>
<br>
As for the BP i'm very very sorry if Pheremone has anything to do with this.  ROA does not have any extra BP's in the bank nor the money to purchase you one..however should we get a spare BP and you have not got another replacement you will be offered it first.<br>
<br>
As for Cataclyzmic this person seems very very bitter (yes we talked to them for a short time) with Daris....all he would say to us is : I'm not Pheramone and she has no control over me...this is a personal issue between me and Deris for screwing me over with his other guild (i'm assuming he's talking DT).<br>
<br>
<br>
I will post more information if we receive it...otherwise like the rest of you...we await Pheramone and Cataclyzmic to post regarding this.<br>

<br>
When I spoke to cataclyzmic he made a strong point that he was screwed out of a kael robe a -FEW- days ago by my current guild truth and honor..Screwed by DT? DT hasn't done Kael for 2+ months and is pretty much dead...Also,If an event DID happen where a bad roll occured..I am in NO way responsible for such.In the convesation he basically laughed at me and said,&quot;a eye for an eye&quot;.All of the events he spoke of never happen,but I did offer cata multible chances to do the right thing and MQ the bp with me,but seems like he wants the suspension/ban an event like this can do to your account.<br>
<br>
I was never an officer or loot officer of DT or TaH nor have I ever done a bad act to either of these characters before.Loot was not my job and I had absoulutely nothing to do how it was handled.If her acusations are true (highly doubtable),It still provides NO excuse for ninja looting the bp.That was a raid *I* lead,and *I* was kind enough to invite him/her on..As far as Cataclyzmic stateing that he is NOT pheramone..I would like to see some of the proof you speaked of Ronx that proves cata=pher.(Will contact you tonight.)<br>
<br>
All guild officers do not recall ever seeing a person by the name cataclyzmic attending *ANY* TaH kael drakkel raid,and a thurg robe has not even dropped for TaH yet..All of these events he claimed happened..didn't.<br>
<br>
Thanks Simc,Dont worry bout the BP tho..If I'm uber enough to solo lodizal while rezzing a hoard of starveing gnomes with a staff of forbidden rights,I think I can earn my own bp hehe. <p><br>
