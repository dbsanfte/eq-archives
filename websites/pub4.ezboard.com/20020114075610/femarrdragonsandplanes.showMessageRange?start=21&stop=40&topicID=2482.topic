Dracco, anonymous flames are prohibited on this board.  Show some courage and admit who you are.

On second thought, maybe you should just keep typing like the retard you obviously are.<br>

I just don't understand why Domination takes fucking losers like you.  There are some good people in that guild, but then some turd like you winds up with a Domination guild tag and I find myself losing all respect for the guild.  And the guild tag doesn't do shit for you.  You're pond scum with a guild tag, instead of just unlabeled pond scum.

The point, my dimwitted friend, is that we could give a rats ass we got trained.  Joy.  I have even stated this.  However, for them to sit there and be beligerent about it, almost proud that they did it, is not very nice behavior, and I'm almost certain something that Domination doesn't appreciate their members doing.  Tell tells and shouts Dinile was spouting were out of line, plain and simple.  If Din had said hey sorry about that, all would have been forgotten.    <p>Tormentcia

<br>
I was there (as Skayle - 26 Iksar SK) and was slain by Xicotl. I had been helping guildies with Epic Mobs and Quest Mobs a few days earlier and this guy was one of the ones we were after (for Pally quest). I called him an Epic Mob in group chat accidentally.<br>
<br>
My issue isn't the train. Trains happen. I've created them myself on occasion. MM, Unrest, SolB etc. You hear someone yell 'train' and zone out or get out of the way.<br>
<br>
The issue (for me) is that a member of Domination (a guild I have friends in and respect) showed no inclination to warn the zone or help with CR afterwards. Not even a 'sorry about the train folks, we got jumped big-time'.<br>
<br>
Just a /ooc shout 'to all the Noobs whining about the train shut up and watch yer arses' [sic].<br>
<br>
I expect this from certain guilds and individuals, but not Domination.<br>
<br>

Add Kraag to the list.  I think I ran into this moron the last time I helped Domination with an epic mob (which I used to do frequently).  Every time I asked whether the mob was up, Kraag would make a penis joke.  Very impressive.<br>

Like the giant fort in FM?  You think those are trains, fuckwit?  You're obviously another loser who has spent his whole time in EQ in Oasis, then LOIO, then FM, then OT, then DL.  Or did you just have someone PL you?<br>
<br>
Yeah, there are trains in MM.  Anyone who hangs out on the train tracks takes a risk.  People who know their way around MM go to spots that aren't on the train tracks, like the Graveyard.  That's what we did.  Think you can handle that concept, dumbshit?<br>
<br>
Here's another radical idea: when you pull a high level mob through an area with lower level characters, you should warn them first so they can get out of the way.  But that's probably too deep for you.  You probably like to train spectres down the beach in Oasis for kicks.<br>

<br>
What the hell is that supposed to mean, dipshit?  So your guildmate is so weak and feeble that he (or she, if you believe the player is female) could only save himself by training the mob into a group of characters in their low 20s?  I guess your buddy was so inept at playing a bard that he couldn't outrun the mob or take the time to say something complex like &quot;Look out!&quot;<br>

<br>
Oh, yes, good point, I forgot KC.  I bet a dipshit like you knows that zone really well.  That seems to be a prime recruiting ground for Domination these days.  I guess Dinile was demonstrating his/her KC pulling tactics in MM.<br>

When I see a flame I always have a good laugh at the fools making asses of themselves but I have no reason to sink to there level be responding in kind. <br>

This is *your* problem, not just Torm's.  This turd had a Domination tag after his name, just like you.  The fact that you don't seem to care speaks volumes about your guild.<br>
<br>
In a way, though, I can understand.  If Domination started doing something about all the punk turds in its ranks, you wouldn't have enough people left to raid Unrest.<br>

<br>
This obviously pissed a few people off.  I've never seen Sage rant using the language he has in this thread.  Not that it's a bad thing, Sage.  You're expressing your feelings and I salute you for it! <br>
<br>
The fact that Domination, what I thought of as a highly respected guild, is not commenting on the actions of one of its members is showing everyone how little they deserve that respect.<br>
<br>
I have friends in Domination, too.  To think that they are not handling this problem internally concerns me.<br>
<br>
Your actions IG directly reflect on the guild to which you belong.  Like it or not, that's the way a lot of people see it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uterekih.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terek IH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/4/01 6:07:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dinile</span><hr size=1> /wave Vanje<br>
