"So this leads to another question...If she was diagnosed with these illnesses....and the one where she was advised not to have any more children...why didn't they tie her tubes? "<br>
<br>
I believe Ms. Yates is a Catholic.  Tying her tubes would be a form of birth control, and therefore sinful.  If her insurance was through a Catholic Hospital, or if her doctor worked for a Catholic Hospital, they would have refused to even discuss such options with her, much less agreed to the operation.  Of course, many Catholics do have this operation and practice the use of birth control, but as stated above, the woman is psychotic.  Insane.  Not thinking straight.  It's entirely possible that while refusing to commit one sin, she committed one many times worse.<br>
I'd also like to thank Salenie and Raedwulf for their insightful posts on the death penalty.  I agree entirely -- except for the part about public hanging.  I believe that if people knew exactly what goes on during one of these state-sanctioned murders, they would be appalled enough.  And if not...well, that's just sick.<br>

I live in Texas, and have followed this story from the beginning.<br>
<br>
This is not Darly Routier, who murdered her children, then claimed an intruder did it.<br>
<br>
This isn't Susan Smith, who's boyfriend didn't want kids.<br>
<br>
This is not the family that locked their child in a closet for years, perpetuating a family secret, and the slow destruction of a child.<br>
<br>
This is not a woman who methodically murdered her children over the years for insurance, boyfriends or the attention. (It's happened, all over this country.)<br>
<br>
This is a woman with a CLEAR history of mental illness, who potentially had a psychotic break, and murdered her children in the midst of it.<br>
<br>
I don't condone what she did.  I don't pretend to know what to do with her, I do know that I can't judge her as harshly as the others I listed above just yet.  Because, if she did suffer a psychotic break, subsequently murdering her children, nothing the State of Texas could do to her will ever be as bad as what she'll do to herself.<br>
<br>
I think Yates is probably in her own personal hell right now, but then, that's just my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2383<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 7:09:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Public Hangings?</span><hr size=1> Without knowing more about the case there's not much I can really comment on without resorting to speculation.  I don't know what kind of medical advice she was under, whether her physician and/or psychiatrist (or other mental health professional, whatever) was competent, whether she understood the severity of her condition, and whether she actually followed whatever medical advice she was given.  I do know that if you drop acid, it'll mess you up.  There's no variable there, it's an objective fact.  Yates' situation is much more complicated.  I dunno, maybe you know some things about her medical history and/or health care that I don't.  This is why I prefer to leave judgement to professionals.  They understand her condition as well as any rational person can, and they have all of the information available on the topic.  Maybe she's a straight-up murderer.  Maybe not.  I don't pretend to be in a position to judge.<br>
<br>
Maybe my point of view is easier to understand explained like this.  You've admitted that you can't even fathom Yates' state of mind.  You don't understand.  I think we're agreed upon that.  Now, bearing in mind that you don't understand and have only a cursory knowledge of mental health care (no offense, but a nurse is about as much a psychiatrist as I am a quantum physicist), what would you do if you were in a position to decide this woman's fate?  To me, that's a scary thought.  All the more so because you strike me as a rational and reasonably moral individual.  If I thought you or any of the other people responding here were some kind of misanthropes I could handle your opinions better.  As it is, I have to say to myself that you guys are overreacting and talking shit like people do on the Internet, because the idea of regular non-psychotic people seriously calling for this woman to be publically executed without due process and without knowing all the facts horrifies me nearly much as a psychotic woman drowning her kids does. <p>Erevan MacQuaide, cleric of Nimue <BR>

Again, I wasn't calling for a public hanging.  If I were sitting face to face with this woman, I would not attack her.  I would be more inclined to say &quot;Okay, so could you attempt to explain this to me in terms I can understand?&quot;  <br>
<br>
My original post, quite simply, was a rant.  I read that she is being charged with 2 counts and that her defense attorneys are pleading &quot;Not guilty by reason of insanity&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I am not even a nurse yet.  I'm simply a student.  I'm a mother of 3.  I know I'm not a psychiatrist and I have not yet claimed to be one.  <br>
<br>
Like I said, my original title was a metaphor.  Based on how I was feeling at the time.  My initial reaction to abuse, neglect or flat out murder is WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD???<br>
<br>
It makes me ill.  It makes me want to rant.  That's what I did.  Had any of my family been awake (Those over the age of 7 anyhow) I would have ranted to them.  I brought it here to the boards to rant to my peers.  The quasi-family I have on EMarr.<br>
<br>
I've rarely disagreed with you, Arikel.  I'm not disagreeing now.  I enjoy hearing the various opinions and points of view brought here by everyone.  <br>
<br>
I have a research paper due at the end of this semester.  I'm doing it on &lt;No title yet&gt; the evils of extremist activism.  I'm one of those people that is usually considered to be &quot;on the fence&quot;.  The reason for that is that I try to always keep an open mind to things.  How can a person claiming to be pro-life shoot a doctor performing abortions?  Isn't it wrong that someone that is against people wearing fur will vandalize property in the name of their cause??  <br>
<br>
Conversely, isn't it okay for someone that doesn't agree with something to share that view in a non-violent, non-hostile way?  I believe so.  That led me here.  A place to vent it out and see what you all had to say about it.<br>
<br>
No matter what her mental state...and yes, I realize that severe mental illness can leave you totally out of control....somehow, somewhere, the system failed those kids.  I was raised Catholic.  I had my last child at a Catholic hospital.  They tied my tubes.  Consequently, the same doctor, a year later, performed my hysterectomy.  Mine had nothing to do with post-partum depression.  It was simply medically necessary for me to A.) not have any more kids and B.) to have that hell they call a uterus removed forever!!!<br>
<br>
I digress....<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I'm not arguing a certain stance here.  I'm simply mortified when I think of what those kids went through.  I look at my babies asleep in their beds and I thank the powers that be that I have healthy kids.  I am not a perfect parent.  We don't have perfect lives...but we don't do too bad.  All in all, I'm one lucky girl.  <br>
<br>
Intelligence can be a curse.  To be a perpetual seeker of knowledge can break you down.  To see what goes on in the world around you can keep you awake at night.  In order that I not keep it all locked in my head...I bring it to others.  I rant, I talk, I jump on a soapbox.  When it all comes down, it's just my 2cp.   <p>Analorne Silversong <BR>

Have you ever been inside a prison?  Or stayed there?  I have gone there as part of ministry efforts and let me tell you it sucks when you know you are going home Sunday.  What do you see a movie or a TV show that says 'cable and tennis courts' and think it's a joy ride?  Imagine spending your life living with strangers being told what to do and when to do it - when you can wake up and go to bed - and also remember - you never leave the building you are in - ever.  Prison is not some country club - yes I'm sure there are exceptions but not many.<br>
<br>
2.  Did you know that most of the criminals in the prison system are there for drug offenses?  Did you know that if you are married to someone that transports a drug accross state lines - even if you didn't know it - that you go to jail automatically for 10 years (assuming they are busted).  There is no trial there - there is no sentencing - if your spouse gets busted and convicted you get AUTOMATIC 10 years.  Ok don't bust on the prison system - bust on the crappy laws that we let run this country and then wonder why our prisons are overcrowded.<br>
<br>
3.  If you think death is the answer I hope you are forced to kill every inmate.  If you are a christian I surely hope that you believe 'judge not lest ye be judged'.  If you are a Wiccan there would be no way in hell you go by 'an it harm none'.  I don't know any mainstream (satanism being not mainstream in any way) where you can find an excuse to kill people.<br>
<br>
4.  It is more expensive to kill someone than to just keep them locked up.  Why?  Appeals... and appeals... and etc.  You know what - HOW MANY DEATH ROW INNMATES HAVE BEEN LET GO BECAUSE THEY WERE PROVEN INNOCENT BY DNA IN THE LAST 5 YEARS?  I'll give you a hint - the answer is greater than 1 and that's just in my state of Illinois.  I sure as well hope that if I were put on death row for a crime I didn't do that I had the chance to prove myself before someone pulled a trigger without thinking because 'swift' justice leaves the sense of vengance and satisfaction to those who want to have rage in thier hearts.<br>
<br>
This topic makes me sick - the woman was sick - the killing of the children was sick - the lust for HER blood makes me sick, and the thought that our prison systems that go by the code 'let 10 guilty men go free than punish one innocent' is 'too easy'.  I won't claim we are perfect.... but we are damn sure better than other places.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah... on another note - just think if we handed over every one of those prisoners in Cuba to the Afgans for punishment - they would have seen a .45 about 30 mins after they were handed over - in between the eyes.  Yes we are so merciful we give people life.  That's what God gives everyone.<br>
<br>
And if you believe in God - you also believe he has the power to kill/stop anyone on this earth at any time.  If he wanted someone dead - he'd do it.  Don't think you know more than he... or she... or it... or whoever/whatever you pray to.<br>

It isn't going to stop the next insane person from killing someone.<br>
<br>
Simply you are not thinking about that sort of thing when you go insane.<br>
<br>
The only deterent to crime is a higher prosecution rate. People are more scared of 5 years in prison for something they think they will get caught for then the death sentence for something they think dont think they will get caught for.<br>
<br>
I believe the figures were 37 years incarceration, considering bulk buying of food, and group accomodation, is the same cost as the death sentence ( including accomodation till death ) Are we going to have to have an actuary attempt to determine what is most cost effective?<br>
<br>
Calling the police afterwards is actually evidence that she is insane as opposed to evidence that she is not. Sane people rarely try to get caught.<br>
<br>
I don't see how anyone can say this is not clearly a matter of diminished capacity.<br>
<br>
People who avoid the death sentence do not go free. Never has this happened in the USA or UK. These people go through lengthy counselling in secured institutions, commonly with large doses of Thorazine and rubber wallpaper.<br>
<br>
The Catholic Church does not condone murder of one's children.<br>
<br>
I will not support the death sentence whilst there is any issue of making a mistake in any criminal court. This is across the board, and because of that I believe you should not have a death sentence for any case, no matter if the defendant pleads guilty.<br>
<br>
We abolished the death sentence in the UK over a hundred years ago. The murder rate here has gone down since then in relation to the overall population of the country.<br>

It's also worth noting that the UK has an overall lower per capita crime rate than the United States, despite not using public caning or other stupid shit.  Hell, some of their cops don't even carry guns.  The point being that brutality is not necessarily the way to reduce the crime rate.  The facts don't lie, and in this case they're pretty simple and easy to understand.<br>

What I want to understand is the number of people pointing fingers and saying kill her.<br>
<br>
You are able to say that someone should die? What this person did?? She killed people. What would you doing if you were the jury? You would kill someone. Where is the difference?<br>
<br>
I can undertand the anger of someone losing a parent, a kid from a murder. I cant understand the murderer. I cant forgive him either. But I will never kill him. <br>
<br>
By condemning someone to death is exactly a murder to me. Those people doing that are acting the same way of the people they are judging.<br>
<br>
Self defence, war are different things. Judging with a cool brain that someone should be killed is exactly the same as killing someone. So, we should condemn all jury voting death penalty and kill them too. <br>
<br>
Vicious circle. Someone has to stop that. Murder is wrong. From any side it come. <p><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief//nosfy01.jpg"><BR>Officer of The Phoenix Crusaders - Guild of Erollisi

Why in the world can a person get out of murdering FIVE PEOPLE because she is &quot;mentally unstable&quot;?  She was found mentally fit to stand trial for MURDER.  Then she should be mentally fit to have the proper sentence carried out for the FIVE MURDERS she committed.<br>

<br>
I agree with you.  I read an article yesterday about a man who had been in prison for 5 years (for rape?) and a DNA test cleared him of the crime.  I think it is positively wonderful that our science is progressing to this point to better ensure we get &quot;the right man&quot;.<br>
<br>
However, that is not the case here.  This woman murdered five innocent children.  There is a reason our society has laws to govern what happens to people that kill other people.  Do you know how many murderers actually commit the crime, yet get off the hook due to their lawyers calling an insanity plea?  Perhaps you should check.<br>
<br>
These people do not need to be roaming around the streets being a danger to anyone that might &quot;trip her trigger&quot;.  If it would ease your conscience, keep her locked up.  Why waste money.  <br>
<br>
Science has not progressed to the point where we can safely say, &quot;Yes, I can cure that person of her illness and then she will no longer be a danger to anyone else&quot;.  All we can do is dope them up in a mental institute until they die.  Why waste money. <p><table rules=none border=0><tr><td><img src="http://www.clanbattleaxe.com/mine/siilver.jpg"></td><td><font face="comic sans ms" size=2">

That's a misconception on the part of the general due to the terminology of &quot;not guilty&quot; and the arguments by the vested interest of death penalty proponents<br>
<br>
The problem is that we can't justify the death penalty for those cases of admission or irrebutable evidence of guilt, when we continue to use it in numerous cases where the evidence is circumstantial and capable of being wrong.  17 people were let off of death row in Illinois a few years back, leading to the moratorium there by a Republican Governor.<br>
<br>
Until there is a 100% foolproof way of determining guilt, death is too high a punishment in cases where we could be wrong. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96910">My Crappy Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulorentic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lorentic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/20/02 2:14:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3066.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> My 2 cents:<br>
<br>
If a "Sane" individual murders another individual NOT in self defense or the defense of another whom is in fatal danger, then TERMINATE that individual.

If an "Insane" individual murders another individual NOT in self defense or the defense of another whom is in fatal danger, then TERMINATE that individual.  Do not waste money on prison OR treatment, do not let them out of jail, etc, etc.  This person has PROVEN a threat to society.  End the threat with extreme prejudice.  Mental state is no excuse for fatal crimes with no foundation.  If they are insane enought to murder in cold blood, why do they deserve treatment?<br>
<br>
PROBLEM:  the US legal system is not dependable.  Captitol punsihment is difficult to enforce at best in crimes where guilt is marginally proven.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER:  This person admitted to it, we know she did.  Kill her the way she killed them.  Drown her on Public television.  Cruel?  Well, perhaps after that people will pay MORE attention to the mental state of their family members and spouses.  MAYBE it will deter sane people from using a false fuckin plea.  <br>
<br>
NOTE: " Sane " and " Insane " are entirely too relative to define and therefore should not be applicable in legal proceedings.  What the Romans, the "craddle of civilization" did in their spare time when not murdering and raping nearby military targets would be considered inhumane and insane by the current definition.<br>

<br>
She KNEW she was committing a crime.<br>
<br>
Based upon what we know, she wasn't hallucinating when she killed them. She didn't think they were attacking her, or confuse them with vermin. No messages from God or the mothership.<br>
<br>
She KNEW who they were, when she killed them.<br>
<br>
Did her husband arrive home to find her knitting some socks and trying to wake up the children from their nap? <br>
<br>
She KNEW they were dead, and that she had done it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The question isn't whether or not she's fucking nuts. I think that's pretty clear. The question is whether or not she knew what she was doing, and whether or not she was able to control herself. That's the insanity defense.<br>
<br>
She controlled herself long enough to wait until her husband was gone, controlled herself long enough to drown four children and then chase the fifth around the house, and knew enough about what she'd done to call the police as soon as she was finished.<br>
<br>
<br>
Crazy? Yeah, duh. Psychotic? I'm not so sure. I hear she's got an affect flatter than a pancake.<br>
<br>
Crazy enough not to be held responsible? Not from the information I've seen. Unless something is being held back, I doubt I'd support the insanity plea if I were on the stand.<br>
<br>
It serves no purpose to execute her, but I don't think she was out of control when she killed those kids. She knew what she was doing, and she knew it was wrong.<br>

Let me point this out to you because so many seem to be misquoting the facts.<br>
<br>
Taken from the Texas state review performed, i.e. not a newspaper ; she murdered her children one by one until all were dead. At this point she carefully laid them on her bed, dried them, and wrapped them in the sheets.<br>
<br>
At which point she then phoned her husband saying she thought something was wrong and that none of her children were moving. Her husband told her to phone the police and the ambulance service. She did. Police officers found her at the scene crying over the bodies. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

My personal opinion is that yes, she murdered her children in cold blood and whether or not she is suffering her own personal hell for it at this point she desrves to be incarcerated and dropped into the genearl population for the jail system where she will suffer a torment that she subjected her children to.  The hell of seeing your brothers and sisters drowned in front of your face while screaming in terror knowing that you are next .. she deserves to be beaten routinely by her cell mates until she no longer has the will to live .. because while she lives her 5 perfect innocent little children are in heaven .. never having had  chance at life and their only crime in life was being born to an ill begotten bitch that never should have had the oppurtunity to reproduce let alone be a mother or a wife.. because she is neither.<br>
<br>
That is my proper Christian attitude about the bitch and where she belongs.  and I hope that when she does pass out of this world whether or not she goes by natural or unnatural causes.  Her one solace is that she goes to hell knowing that her genocidal acts against her own kids will come back to her 10 fold by the master of evil.<br>
