If you want to become friends with the people here on this forum then try having a conversation with those that are active in the community. That is what this place is - its a community forum *looks up at the glaring title above every page* please treat it as such. The fact that the majority of people here play everquest is almost a moot point. If we wanted to just come here and get game info or items or plat or anything having to do with IN GAME activity, we would probably just sit in EC and overuse the shout channel. <p><font face="Lucida Handwriting" size="3"><b><a href="mailto:yensidthewiz@attbi.com">Wiley Coyote/Yensid</a></b></font><br>

<br>
It would be a more apt comparison if the cabby had been rescued and placed out of harms way, and a few days later goes to the surrounding towns and places a full page add in the local papers there. In that add he explained that he got his license a few months ago after migrating here from a horribly oppressed country. He worked very hard to scrape up enough money to buy a cab and start working as a cabie. BUT a few weeks ago he misjudged a corner and he wrecked his cab <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   NOW he has not source of income and is very sad. He even said that he may just move back to his old country. UNLESS some of the nice people who read this add give him money for a new cab.

That was about five minutes after that Officer started looking, mind you. He could not tell where he had died in OT as well.<br>
<br>
So either he was scamming here about having died in OT, or he really doesn't care about the gear on it. Since the next best f00l would be kind enough to give him new gear anyway. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> THAT</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is the value he attaches to his gear.<br>

Same story different circumstances, cabby obviously more severe.  Severeness of circumstances necessary to make the point sometimes.  Let's make it so the cabby had NEVER visited LA.  First time visiting LA and got trapped under a car... woops it's your first time to LA can't help you, &quot;fuck off&quot;.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the heads up on the OT incident... however it should always be a given that you help people and then ask questions later, if ONLY to set the example.  Be nice to even your worst enemies, and fight jerks with kindness.  And that's assuming that she lied or whatever.  For all we know she didn't want the officer to spend so much time helping her out of pure selflessness.<br>
<br>
And I still have yet to see anyone dispute that fact that she was treated badly after her first post, not her last post in which she struck back.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A> at: 2/6/02 8:04:09 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utsbaity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tsbaity</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.millan.net/anims/giffar/syellow1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 11:01:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: somoene stole my $hiot</span><hr size=1> I think the point Kaysha wes trying to make was that the stories that Veeta told our guild and the one he posted here did not connect. In guild, he said he had died in OT and when an officer went to help look for his corpse, he said &quot;don't worry about it, I'll let it rot&quot;.<br>
<br>
Then, here he says that he lost everything because it fell to the ground during a transfer (as an aside, he could not have lost everything as his inventory must have been full if it fell to the ground).<br>
<br>
When I talked to Veeta, he was wearing full FP and crafted armor, wielding a wurmy and centi LS (said the weapons were given to him), nice equipment for a level 30, and was trying to sell the wurmy in EC.<br>
<br>
Three of our officers discussed the post here with him, myself being the last, and he was rude each time (much worse than his posts here). Personally, I don't believe anything Veeta says as he can't seem to stick to a story. He broke our rule against begging in the first couple days of his probation period, and he was rude to our officers. Thus, he was removed.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to give him items, that's their business, but I will not have any more dealings with him. <p><a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=44763"><img src="http://members.home.net/fran98765/yenen2.jpg"></a><br>Channeler of the 54th season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uphalladarlevoleur.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phalladar LeVoleur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 11:34:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: somoene stole my $hiot</span><hr size=1> quack quack <p><p><p><p><p align="center"><img src="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/bandwidth/phalsiwnew3.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwilleycoyote.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Willey Coyote</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 2:31:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.tripod.co.uk/panikos/Odds/panikos.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: somoene stole my $hiot</span><hr size=1> Venen did you even read past the first paragraph?

I never claimed it was a perfect analogy.  If a person needs help, then a person needs help, whether it's with passing the salt or saving their life.  You can call any and all of it begging.  Have you ever asked for help when you could have done it yourself given a certain amount of work?  Thus my point... the guy could have spent the last 6 months building muscles to prepare for the incident.  That doesn't make it right to not help him.  But let's just suppose that the guy had no right to ask for help and it was all his own fault.

<br>
It's like someone claiming that they lost a son in the WTC event. Then just before Thanksgiving lost another son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren in a horrific car accident.<br>
<br>
Then telling people they're going to have problems with the funeral expenses.<br>
<br>
Then people are suspicious. Someone wonders aloud why they're putting a sign in their parking lot attendant window (where they work). Some sanctimonious people shush them. How DARE they question a tragedy. <br>
<br>
The more cynical people among them start to sniff a mouse. After all, why put a sign in the window when there are numerous organizations that can better help. They see other people giving this guy money. They don't have a problem with people being charitable. They have a problem with people scamming others.<br>
<br>
Later it all comes out that there is no record of anyone with the son's name dying at the WTC. Nor is there any record of the car crash. The guy begins to get defensive. He removes the sign. He refuses to talk to reporters.<br>
<br>
People weren't picking on him because he was a poor old parking attendant who put a sign up. They had a gut instinct that something wasn't right. And maybe they're unable to verbalize that process. SOMETHING about it didn't seem right.<br>
<br>
So they say, &quot;Geez, why put up a sign, that kinda stinks&quot; and someone thinks &quot;HEY! That's the only way the guy has to reach out, he's not rich, he doesn't have the knowledge base you have. How DARE you!&quot;<br>
<br>
They're not bagging on the sign. They're pointing out things that frankly question the credibility of the entire thing.<br>
<br>
Some people were furious that it was ever questioned in this case. And yes, it's a real life scenario where a reporter got involved. They took the moral high ground of how DARE people question it. They're just picking on the poor old guy. In some cases I think it's because they like being able to take the moral high ground. It gives them the santimonious self righteousness of &quot;See, you're all bad, bad people. I'm a good person. See <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> what</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a good person I am&quot;.<br>
<br>
In other cases it's because they don't want to look like a fool. No one likes being fooled. In other cases it's because they don't want to believe people are that shitty.<br>
<br>
Regardless in Veetas case, it's been more than proven that this person was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lying</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. They didn't have help refused because they couldn't spell for shit. They had help refused because most people sensed that something was wrong with the story. It didn't ring true. Even still, some people gave the benefit of the doubt and extended help. Others may have thought it seemed untrue, but didn't say anything. Some maybe because they didn't want to look like a jerk. Other people voiced their opinions that it was all a bunch of bullshit.<br>
<br>
And some nice people who helped got burned. <br>
<br>
Who gets hurt? As always the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> real</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people who <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>do </u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->need assistance, whether in real life situations, or in a game. It makes everyone just a little more cynical the next time someone asks for help.  <p><a href="http://www.anarchyboard.com" target="_blank">

The only thing she was supposedly lying about was the school she attended, big whoopidy doo.  We don't really know that for sure either.  The moral high ground thing could be said about any stand anyone makes, so that's just a blanket statement /shrug.  It would seem easier to just go with the flow rather than risk making a fool of oneself.  I'm not concerned that it was question... by all means, question away.  But don't flame and tell someone to fuck off.  Just asking for a little decency and understanding, but apparently it's a bit much to ask. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 4:22:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.crocker.com/~denise/amflag.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: somoene stole my $hiot</span><hr size=1> Errr questioned &lt;edit thx ~&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umustelafuro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mustela Furo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boardaholic</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 4:30:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1664.topic&index=101>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.swbell.net/sdspies/images/ferret-d.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: somoene stole my $hiot</span><hr size=1> Not that Veeta's probably going to respond to this post anymore, but I'd just like some clarification on this.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> i do plan on paying him back im now making money resaling items<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is probably yet another reason why people think this person is a liar.
