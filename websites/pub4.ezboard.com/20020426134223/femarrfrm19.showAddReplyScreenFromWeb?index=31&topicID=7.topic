They were tired of Everquest, and wanted to move on, so I decided to go along with them. I'm not really tired of Everquest, in fact I used to be very tired of it, and would have been overjoyed at DAOC's inception, but here recently, I've been on an EQ kick...perhaps...hell, I dunno why.<br>
<br>
After reading up on the game, I saw a slew of features I liked, and had often wished EQ had, as well as a few down sides. Trivial loot code being among them. Not that I hate Trivial Loot Code, I just don't like the premise...but that's a different post entirely.<br>
<br>
Getting in the game was fine, but the interface sucks, at least to me. EQ had such a simplistic, easy interface that I think was part of the &quot;magic&quot; that Tuan was talking about. Not all of it, but part of it, at least for me.<br>
<br>
However, I'm now stuck. I just can't see myself getting into a game like this. Maybe I'm seeing it wrong, but here are my major complaints with the game, that I think could quite easily be it's demise.<br>
<br>
-class uniqueness<br>
I understand that each class is different, and that you need healers, tanks, blah blah blah...but I'm not seeing the same 'recipe&quot; I saw in Everquest.<br>
<br>
Enchanters mez. Shamans slow. Clerics heal. I have always had a problem choosing the class for me, because each class had a major advantage I loved, with a major disadvantage I hated.<br>
<br>
Enchanters own in groups, and have amazing spells, but low hitpoints and no healing spells. <br>
<br>
Shamans slow rocks and can heal, canni, buff, haste, pet...so many cool things, but no mez, and can't melee.<br>
<br>
Monk melee rocks, and pulling is wonderful, but no spells. Rogues damage rocks, but no pulling (normally for aggro) and even so, are hitting from the back.<br>
<br>
Rangers I love, but shunned from groups a lot, and if not, not actively sought after, and even then, wish I could tank like a warrior.<br>
<br>
You all know the pros and cons I list. They're part of our everyday life in EQ, but they made teamwork crucial.<br>
<br>
Right now, I see the same thing in DAOC, but it's all mushed together. Be the class you want. It sounds like what I really wanted, but it takes away the spice. Perhaps I'm just being masochistic...<br>
<br>
-dungeons and items<br>
<br>
This one may take time. I remember Everquest in the newbie days, but at least there was Crushbone to go to. there was a Shiny Brass Shield to camp, or a Dragoon dirk. I don't want a random item dropped from a random mob. <br>
<br>
I want the prestige of getting this, whether it's uberly rare, or perma camped...or any other reason. I had pride when I first looted my FBSS, because it was coveted. Not only from it's effect, but the Frenzy was a tough battle on a group still in bronze and crafted. I wasn't sitting, patrolling the zone area killing wans when I got this, moving only so our group got the xp bonus. <br>
<br>
And while I hear there are cool dungeons, either I haven't heard of them, or there is not nearly enough. Probably both. My fondest memories (and sometimes worst) are great fun groups I had in CT, or Lguk or SolB.<br>
Which brings me to my next point.<br>
<br>
-chatter.<br>
<br>
yea, chatter is annoying. It's also personal, and adds that human depth that made Everquest the 3 year saga it is, rather than a one month sleeper.<br>
I rarely, if ever see anyone talking in /broadcast. Maybe you guys adore it, but I WANT to talk to people. And even then, that's not neccesarry. I just want to see other people. I rarely see that, since the counry side seems to be so vast.<br>
<br>
-endgame.<br>
<br>
It'll be great to raid other realms, and fun. Something that DAOC will always own EQ on, probably. But, I want some big ass monster I may never see, that drops some insane sword I'll probably never weild, because it gives me ambition, and desire. I'm sure they'll have these, but who knows.<br>
<br>
I guess my real problem, is that I like the newness, but I'm too new. I want to know something, so I can get by, instead of groping in the darkness like I am. Maybe it will really by the game for me in 6 months, but right now it seems to be a solo fest, EQ lite. No insult, merely an observation.<br>

<br>
when I first installed the game the controls seemed completly out of place, the insane feeling of newbieism was overwhelming, and understanding the classes was a change.<br>
<br>
However, if you go in thinking its EQ with EQ defined classes, it wont work.<br>
EQ classes were defined rather than let the player build them...this was cool at first, but the end game character was defined by gear..that kinda sucks. Everyone knew which stat to raise to make their mana pool higher, make them hit harder etc etc. The change DAoC has to the character creation kinda puts that idea up to the creator. This can be good and bad depending on the decisions made. Gives it more of a uniqueness, In my opinion<br>
<br>
<br>
Go in thinking its a new game (which it is) and that with a new game there are gonna be changes.<br>
<br>
trivial loot code can suck, especially if you just found out about a lowbie quest that would be cool to do, but the MoB is now greyed out. eh it happens i spose.<br>
<br>
 But on the other hand, with anti-pharmer code, anti-loot whoring, anti-tossing items in a bag to claim NBG on a daily basis, I think it has great potential. A plus for the weekend gamer or casual player. Guild structure is a definite plus..with emblems for the guild, and banks(if they get around to getting it in).<br>
<br>
Another plus is no more late-night-I-need-to-get-to-sleep corpse runs. definite advantage to the casual gamer.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the game seems to open up a whole new set of ideas that were once not viable in the MMORPG's previously made..with the exception of AO, which shot themselves in the foot due to bad release.<br>
<br>
I think it will be an interesting high end game, rather than camp Uber MOB101, players will be camping other players..a new excitement. <br>
<br>
My opinion would be that it does definitly have a life span, up until SB comes out. SB seems to gear around the same PvP aspect(seiges, city control, guild strucure), and once gamers get a taste of the 'non-grief-killing-PvP-blood', it will become more mainstream.<br>
Just my thought<br>

They've taken all the things that people didn't like about EQ, changed them and then paraded it around (admittedly, the fanboys are largely responsible for this) as &quot;lookie here, we fixed all this stuff from EQ, come play our game&quot;..<br>
<br>
And then they hired Tweety and Lum, which I see as just a jaded publicity stunt to attract all the people that were fed up with EQ.. <br>
<br>
It may turn out to be a good idea, or it may turn out that the flaws of EQ weren't so bad after all (like the previous poster mentioned with random drops/trivial loot).. <br>
<br>
Either/or it kinda rubs me the wrong way.. I'll still try it and see if it is better, when my amazon order gets around to arriving <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

One thing I see in favour of Shadowbane at the moment, they're presenting it as a game in it's own right, rather than &quot;Come here little boy, I've got some candy for you, and we don't have EQ's downtime!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugirolamosavonarola.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Girolamo Savonarola</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/23/01 5:24:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My personal problem</span><hr size=1> Actually, I play both, quite happily at that.<br>
<br>
DAoC is it's own game.  There is honestly nothing in DAoC stolen from EQ. (however you might want to rephrase that sentence its still true)<br>
<br>
In DAoC I have fun, in EQ I have fun.  All you people who are too small minded to understand anything except by comparison are hilarious arguing all these completely useless points.<br>
<br>
It comes down to whats fun, wherever and however you have fun I don't care.  If you have fun arguing with each other here, great, I dont mean you.  If your just too damn stupid to understand the difference between things without your little laundry list of items you have seen other people discuss, please forget you have ever heard of EQ or DAoC so I don't have to bother with you.<br>

The trivial loot code in DAoC is only for the trivial loot though.. if you do a quest (which all the one time drop magic items are considered quests..) then you still get the reward.. even if the quest is to kill a grey mob.  I love the fact that you can't get alot of the items more than once.. eliminates camping and makes you really think about whether you want to trade or sell that thing away.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I love the interface.. expecially how the battle spam is seperated from the chat and the fact that you can move anything anywhere, change the color of all the text, and set the transparency of the windows all from the screen itself.. no hacking through a ini file.

I rarely, if ever see anyone talking in /broadcast. Maybe you guys adore it, but I WANT to talk to people. And even then, that's not neccesarry. I just want to see other people. I rarely see that, since the counry side seems to be so vast.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

the thing is.. there were no big mean ass monsters in EQ when it first started either..

I understand that each class is different, and that you need healers, tanks, blah blah blah...but I'm not seeing the same 'recipe" I saw in Everquest.</font><br>
<br>
In my opinion, daoc rules all in the class uniqueness category. Not only do you have 10-12 classes to pick from, you can choose which path you take within those classes. You might want to be a healer for that fact that you can wear plate and res people, but instead of specializing in mend(the big heal spec line) you might spec in pacification(the mezz/stun line) so you can control a fight much like an EQ enchanter.<br>
<br>
When you level up in daoc some skills go up automatically. For others, you have a choice to make on where you want to spend points. You can be well diverse or really good at one of your spec lines.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00>-dungeons and items<br>
<br>
This one may take time. I remember Everquest in the newbie days, but at least there was Crushbone to go to. there was a Shiny Brass Shield to camp, or a Dragoon dirk. I don't want a random item dropped from a random mob.</font><br>
<br>
There are dungeons, about 4 of them per realm, you just need to look for them. As for the ‘I want mob A to drop item X’, well, I loathe that concept. That’s the entire basis behind “CAMP CHECK”, quite possibly the most annoying thing one can hear in any zone.<br>

<br>
I havent personally played it, but it has enough of a base and has done a good enough job so far to prove it is worthy of status at least equal to AC, which, though dying, will probably make it to the 2 year mark.<br>
<br>
Its still gonna be tough to unseat EQ as king of MMORPGs though. DAoC is a good game but not good enough to claim the title. It may be prettier, it might even offer decent gameplay, but EQ has one thing that DAoC doesnt. Establishment. EQ was the first to really get MMORPGing right. <br>
<br>
Someone pointed out that DAoC is evolutionary, not revolutionary. I dont think we will see anything Revolutionary until more hardware technologies evolve. EQ was definately Revolutionary. We probably cannot even concieve of what it would take at this point to make a game revolutionary from the current MMOGs. THe people that can concieve and implement that, will be as rich as Verant. <br>
<br>
I think there will definately come a time when Evolution of the genre alone may unseat EQ. EQ is still limited by some of the technologies that they started with. I would definately keep an eye on some of the games coming up, like Warcraft Worlds and Horizons.<br>
<br>
One thing has been proven over the last three years. New MMoRPGs do not replace old ones. They simply carve a niche for themselves in a continuously growing market. DAoC made it past the make or break point, they released their game without flopping on release.  They should be around for a few years.<br>
<br>
It is, however, a safe bet, to say that EQ, in some form, will still be around when DAoC goes away. Simple business logic means that Verant(SoE) will be able to acquire the resources needed to keep EQ competitive. <br>

The PK system has not yet kicked in. There is no way to tell if it works<br>
until it is actually time to go raid. It is possible people on the Merlin server<br>

 I personally dont think hardware has anything to do with evolutionary VS revolutionary.  Shadowbane, promises to let the players reshape the world. IE if you leave EQ and come back 6 months later Freeport will still be where it was when you left. IN SB if things go like they plan you leave for 6 months That city you visited just before you left could be a smoldering pile of rubble. To me that kind of game will be Revolutionary.<br>

 Maybe your talking about somthing completely different than I am. In UO you could place a building correct? But once placed noone else could destroy it. In SB you will be able to build a building but somone with enough power can come by and knock it flat. Players changing the face of the world they play in. Thats REVOLUTIONARY.

**************************************************************<br>
why not just upgrade everything else?<br>
<br>
Some things in a game call for an upgrade of classes and some thing call for a nerf, usually it’s a well defined line of demarcation between the two.<br>
<br>
In beta, Archers were God up until a point(and I believe I posted about this here before). They get a critical shot ability that gives them a multiplier of damage and they also get the hide skill that renders them almost completely invisible, totally invisible at a distance. So archers would roam the battlefield, or stand in one place, completely unseen and just snipe people. It doesn’t sound all that bad, pretty neat actually, but the broken aspect was that hiding was instantaneous. Meaning, Archer would snipe someone and appear for a split second before going inviso again. Even if you managed to target him in that brief instant, you lost the target when he went into sneak mode again. Insta-hide was very, very broken and no amount of buffing to other classes would have brought it in line.<br>

An email went from me to Sanya to Marc Jacobs and sneak gained a 10-second reuse time in the next patch. They’re still hella-powerful, they just have to put more thought into where they shoot from instead of standing in an open field while mowing people down. <br>

Vendrix, <br>

The concept of 'fairness' offends you? What you are saying is that unless<br>
you can get enough people together in one spot for enough time to get that<br>
one item or dead monster, your not happy? That is exactly why EQ sux right now.<br>
<br>
Listen, Crack-head Bob, I don’t know which post written by whoever you read, thought I wrote and then felt the need to replied to - but it wasn’t mine. At no point in time did I pen-out anything in this entire thread that made a veiled or distant reference to ‘fairness’ in any form what so ever.<br>
<br>
Quit making up shit you fucking psycho! <br>

<br>
Ok the first post:<br>
<br>
This is of course the most revealing thing about Varixx.<br>
The underlying implication is obvious: Varixx opinion supersedes anyone elses.<br>
That is implicit in the post.<br>
<br>
First we have the 'problem' identified obviously by Varixx.<br>
Then we have the name dropping, and in theory a possible solution to the problem.<br>
Then we have an imperfect solution but better than before.<br>
<br>
We (the reader) are to infer that Varixx has vigilantly contributed to the overall<br>
game system. We are also to infer that he is on a first name basis with the people<br>
running the game and the implication therefore that his word carries greater<br>
weight than (for example) the reader's.<br>
<br>
I have an alternative reading:<br>
There are a few things that Varixx left out: <br>
First he and his cronies have chosen to focus on Midgard.<br>
That particular realm has a shocking lack of archers(compared to the others).<br>
It is therefore somewhat obvious that they are at a BIG disadvantage when<br>
facing say 9 Rangers. I daresay they would be gunned down quickly.<br>
However why is this 'bad'?  Obviously because they are not doing the killing.<br>
I must assert that I suspect the other side would say it was 'good'<br>
In fact I would assert that anytime Varixx can be PK'ed and cant fight back<br>
is ALWAYS good and should be encouraged.<br>
<br>
As for the not very subtle name dropping and implied 'inside' connection<br>
to the people running the game. Beware Varixx, that is an obvious ploy.<br>
If you think the designers dont know that, you are greatly mistaken.<br>
They are MORE than aware.<br>
Nothing would give me greater pleasure than running over you in a faction fight.<br>
Fate is inscrutable, only time can tell.<br>
<br>
I will state flatly Varixx that nothing in that post impressed me whatever.<br>
I find Ogmuks posts to be FAR more informative and much less pompus.<br>
But then he is more concerned with actually imparting information, than in<br>
trying to build up an image.<br>
<br>
Now his reply to me:<br>
<br>
It is possible that I erred in my identification of the original writer.<br>
Ah well, thats the way things go.<br>
<br>
As for his semantic content? Again vintage Varixx. <br>
First we have Doctor Varixx practicing medicine without a license again,<br>
(you know thats is illegal right Varixx?)<br>
And then the inevitable banal invective. Apparently Varixx holds you all in such<br>
contempt that he feels that mindlessly attaching invective to flame is<br>
enough to win an arguement. <br>
<br>
Bring it on child.<br>
