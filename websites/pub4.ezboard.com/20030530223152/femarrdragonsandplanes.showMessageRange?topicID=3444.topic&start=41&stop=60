Da NeXt Generation!</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;but it does keep you coming back here... must be doing something right.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
this seems to be crux of the matter to you--JUST as I said. winning is more important than being right to you.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Where was that link someone posted to ad hominem attacks? Someone here needs a debate lesson.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
this isnt a debate. You are not presenting any evidence. You are throwing around lies and incorrect facts and non germane stand alone statements<br>
<br>
 &lt;&lt;Attacking a person's character doesn't make your arguement correct. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
character? what character? You are a loser who feeds his obsession by scheming ways to trap people on a message board. What does that have to do with character?  You started this whole thread to have an excuse to call me your cool board guy names like a 6th grader and then you talk to me about attacking someone's character? pretty funny<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;By the way.. where have I lied or cheated?&gt;&gt; <br>
<br>
go back and re read my posts. I have pointed them out to you all along. Here are a few of my favorites:<br>
<br>
You lied when you said it wasnt personal. No one could possibly go through so much trouble to &quot;trap&quot; a complete stranger on a message board if it wasnt personal, never mind brag about it afterwards.<br>
<br>
You attempted to &quot;cheat&quot; by blatantly leaving out the IF part of my statement when you copied and pasted it.<br>
<br>
You repeatedly attempted to &quot;cheat&quot; by switching your words for mine in supposedly attacking what I said. <br>
<br>
You lied when you made up that comment about Hamilton's slave activities. You were clueless and were too prideful to admit you had no idea what I was talking about.<br>
<br>
For the many other examples you will have to go back and re read my posts. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Im not obsessed with you.. just keeping your overeager typing fingers occupied&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
If my fingers are so overeager, why would I need you to help keep them occupied?  You once again are so eager to attack me that you just make no damn sense. You yourself admit that you arent achieving your goal. I post on all those threads that interest me. I guess you are as bad a trapper as you are student of history.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; I'm far from dumb&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I see   you are not a moron, you just play one on this board? You have been proven wrong over and over and over. You have not been able to contruct a post that didnt contain lies, fabrications or mistaken facts . . . and yet you are a genius. I see. How interesting. Your words belie your words.<br>
<br>
On that note I owe you an apology. While I find it hard to imagine anyone as smart as you claim to be could be as ignorant as you appear to be, it is not a metaphysical impossibility. So, while you repeatedly prove yourself to be ignorant, that is not the same as stupid. I suppose that it is possible, although I dont see how, that you are as smart as you claim to be AND as ignorant as you prove yourself to be. But for someone so smart . . . you sure dont know much.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;.. and as far as being an egoist.. it's not hard to feel superior to you.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
how can you feel superior to anything after you have been proven over and over to not know what you are talking about?  Each time I prove you wrong, you move on to attempt to find something else to attack me on. How many times do you have to be shown to be wrong and a buffoon to realize that your amazing ability to be impressed with yourself is misplaced?<br>
<br>
How can a pathetic little sicko like you possibly feel superior to anything when you feel the compulsion to &quot;trap&quot; strangers on a message board? How can such a sad little loser possibly feel superior after setting traps so he can act like a 6th grader and jump out of the dark places in which he normally skulks just to point a finger and call someone names?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Actually.. I work nights&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Gee  why am I not surprised. I can just imagine you skulking around in the dark<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;And that's soldier&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
no, actually it isnt. There ya go trying again to substitute YOUR words for mine. Soldier is something honorable.  Soldiers dont have to skulk around on message boards trapping people. Soldiers arent pathetic little losers like you have proven yourself to be. You are a lil sojer boy. The kind of macho moron who who couldnt make it in the real world until his superiors told him the difference between wiping his nose and wiping his ass. The kind who had to go into the military so they wouldnt be a drain on our society. There is a big difference.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Your view of this world is straight out of someone's lecture hall... try experiencing life and speaking from that&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
drop and give me twenty and admiring the rear end of the guy marching ahead of you is not experiencing life. The military is not real life for a loser sojer boy like you. You dont have to get a job on your own merits. You dont have to be responsible for anything because some real soldier tells you sojer boys when to wake up, when to eat, when to @#%$, shower, shave, everything. That is a refuse from the real world. Obviously you were a total waste of time for the real soldier who tried to turn you into something productive because here you are, still a loser sojer boy. Still trying to pass himself off as someone who knows something but doesnt have the good sense to quit when you are shown for the know nothing you are . . . over and over. Time after time I showed your lack of knowledge on a subject YOU brought up and you didnt have the good sense to skulk off with your tail between your legs. Heck, you didnt even have the good sense to at least check your facts the next time! Dont you have any pride? You are like that dumb dog you kick when you come home that doesnt have any better sense than to keep coming back for more.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If I wanted to hear your teachers speak.. I'd swing by the local elementary school.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
first good idea I have heard from you. If you went back to school, maybe you wouldnt sound so stupid showing off your lack of knowledge. .<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Something needed done, so I did it&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
there is that ego again. maybe you could have it surgically removed when you go to get your foot removed from your mouth . . . or your head from your ass.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Not only did it work like a charm.. but it STILL is  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Gee  what a surprise! You contradicting yourself. How long has it been that you told Tuan that your plan wasnt working because I was still on other threads? LOL  What a loser!<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;So far you've managed to insult pretty much every faction you've spoken about.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
so is this a clue to your delusion? do you think you are still in the game? Do you think I see a message after each of my posts leaving you dead or dying telling me my faction has gone up? WTF are you talking about? I havent spoken about any &quot;factions&quot; and i couldnt possibly insult you as much as your own words and deeds do. You get more scary and delusional with each posts. First you set out to protect the message board from evil trolls and appointed yourself some kind of protector of all that is good and holy. Now you are seeing factions and consiracies in a game related message board? You need serious help. No @#%$ here, you need help.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Are you now throwing the armed services into that one as well&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
again, trying to change my words around. I insulted little sojer boys like you. I did not insult the armed forces. My saying Clinton is a lying scumbag is not insulting the whole US. Neither is my insulting YOU an indictment of the whole armed forces. On the other hand just as Clinton was an insult to the U.S., YOU are an insult to the armed forces. Do your superiors know you skulk around message boards setting traps for trolls? Do they know you see factions and conspiracies everywhere? I am sure they know how little you know about American history. Just another attempt at cheap theatrics to change the topic. if nothing else, you are predictible. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You ostracize yourself better than anyone I've ever met.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
ostracize . . . to banish from a group, society, etc.<br>
<br>
now just how does one drive oneself away? One can withdraw from a group as in becoming a hermit. But I dont think one can banish oneself. Maybe if I was a king, I could banish myself in a legal sense, but alas I am not a king. Not even a guild leader, so I have to take your terms in the common sense.<br>
<br>
Even at the low rates teachers get paid, you must owe me 5 months pay. I realize you havent learned anything but that is the student's fault, not the teachers in this case<br>
<br>
 <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

You said <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &lt;&lt;I'm firmly aware of Hamilton's slave business.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
lol nice try . . . thanks for playing . . . here is your home version of the game . . . dont let the door hit you on your way out. Like I said, do your homework. Hamilton, pretty much singlehanded, laid out and built our nations financial plan and institutions including preparing a comprehensive study of our nation's financial, economic and commercial position and infrastructure making him the single most appropriate person to describe the nations economical underpinnings at the time of its founding. If Hamilton had a slave business, it would not make him any more singularly qualified than any other slave trader to describe the Nation's early economic underpinnings. But (golf clap) nice try at BSing your way through that one<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  In your unequaled intelligence, you denounce my lack of knowledge of someone you obviously know everything about.  UMMM... The Alexander Hamilton that was one of our founding fathers despised slavery.  He hated it.  He founded an abolitionist movement.  Surely you (who obviously have his bio for toilet bowl literature) would know this.  here's a quote from a page about our glorious founding father..<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That Hamilton was frowned upon as a youngster can be reasonably assumed by his behavior later in life: primarily his preoccupation with matters of honor and character, and his often visceral reactions to criticism aimed at him. The harsh and shameful circumstances of his childhood haunted Hamilton throughout his life; and even long after he had proved himself a brave soldier and a brilliant statesman, the whispering continued. <br>
<br>
Oddly, after his family situation had disintegrated, Alexander's life seemed to improve immensely. His experience as bookkeeper in his mother's store landed him a job as a clerk with the international trading firm of Nicholas Cruger, a New Yorker whose business hub was on St. Croix. Here he mastered the intricacies of global finance and experienced first hand the material interests of peoples and countries. He also saw the darker side of international dealings, as the island was a center for the slave trade. Hamilton came away with a deep hatred of slavery, and he eventually co-founded an abolitionist society in New York. Nothing Hamilton experienced ever went unused. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  or click here to read it yourself <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://franklaughter.tripod.com/cgi-bin/history/hamilton2.html">franklaughter.tripod.com/...lton2.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

poor sicko little sojer boy. He thinks he defends our rights on the batlefield while he comes to message boards and tries to deprive us of our rights. Maybe I should have asked just WHOSE military it is you you are a member of? Since you attempt to deprive people of their right to free speech here on this message board, maybe you are a member of the Cuban military? Or the Iraqui military? It sure is hard to imagine some AMERICAN soldier (or even lil sojer boy) putting his life on the line to protect Americans' rights and then working in his off time to deprive Americans of their rights. Oh well, wouldnt be the first time you have contradicted yourself.<br>
<br>
It is really sad how your delusions cause you to think you are actually popular. I would bet that everyone is sick of BOTH of our posts, but while I admit to and apologize for my long posts, you actually believe everyone sees you as a hero! You admit that you are intentionally perpetuating this ridiculous string of senseless posts just to stroke your massive ego and then think anyone finds you heroic? You are seriously deluded. <br>

I responded back here because unlike YOU, I am not out to irritate other readers who have no interest in this little pissing match. And yes, that is just what this is.

Da NeXt Generation!</span><hr size=1> Re: your quote on Hamilton . . .<br>
<br>
I am almost embaressed to point this out but it was YOU that said Hamilton was involved in the slave trade. I quite clearly called your bluff and showed you were too prideful to admit you had no idea what I was talking about so you made up that comment about Hamilton's involvement in the slave trade.<br>
Have you given up on failing to disprove MY words so you are gonna start disproving your own now?<br>
<br>
This has to be the single funniest thing I have ever seen on a message board. You have forgotten which statements are yours and which are mine and now are arguing with yourself!<br>
<br>
Hint . . . mine are the correct ones!<br>
<br>
BTW   you might notice that my corrections of you come immediately. I dont have to look these things up. You on the other hand have let 20 posts or so go by while you actually look up a fact . . . and then can only find one that argues with yourself.   LOL   too funny <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

I know that someone that talks out of their ass like you could never make it there.. so I'm positive you dont know what you're talking about.<br>
<br>
I still haven't lied..You're saying I took it as a personal attack.. I've explained numerous times that I didn't feel it was a personal attack and that you're just a fvcking idiot (but you cant grasp this).  I'm sorry.. you must know what all I'm thinking the same way you know what all the founding fathers were.  I'll explain once again.. I didn't trap you because it's personal.. but because you are a friggin moron who's sheer volume of post is offensive.<br>
<br>
Your cheating comment is laughable.  Oops.. the 3rd time I pasted Merentha's BS volume XLII I missed the beginning of the sentence.<br>
<br>
As far as the faction comment.. you should have looked it up when you were trying to find out what ostracize meant.  It means a clique.. or a group of people if that is easier for you to understand.  That includes the servicemen that risk their ass so you can run that little mouth of yours and the people who were informed by you that their religeon was outdated because we have refrigeration now.<br>
<br>
As far as a drain on society.. I had a full scholarship as a pre-med student lined up when I went into the marines.  I did my duty first (you should try it sometime) and got my college education after I got out.  Oh yeah.. and I've held a job since I was 13.. means paying taxes.. we already had that conversation.. remember?  Should I go into some of the other things I have done to help my society?  Would helping handicapped children at an equestrian center so they can realize that they're functional and able people count?  You have no idea who I am or what the fvck you're talking about.  Thanks for trying though.. play again.  How about volume XCIV?<br>
<br>
P.S.  I could work the morning shift (in the computer command center for a major credit card company) but the night pays much better.  I was on day shift for over a year before I decided to change to this shift.  Money will do that to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umerentha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merentha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/29/02 4:10:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3444.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Troll wars...

Back to the dunce.  I never said Hamilton was a slave trader.  I said I was firmly aware of his slave business.  Once again.. he was an abolishionist.  That means he was doing away with it.  I posted it because I was disagreeing with you.. like most everything else you utter.  I seriously doubt that someone who hated the slave trade that much would say it was our saving grace.<br>

You think I'm trying to be these people's hero?  I'm sure almost everone who glanced at it quit looking a long time ago.  It's not to win their praises.. it's to occupy and annoy you.<br>

This is an outright lie and you know it!  have you no shame?<br>
Abolitionism is NOT someones slave business. It is the antithesis of the slave business. So damn prideful you cant just admit you are wrong. You are lying pond scum. No one, not even you would describe abolitionist activities as slave business. You obviously think the whole world is a dumb as you are if you think anyone is buying your damn lies. Even if you were wrongheaded enough to refer to working towards the abolishment of slave business as slave business, It is NOT germane. You STILL had no idea why I said Hamilton was uniquely qualified to determine the level of slavery's import to the newly formed country. Deny all you want but you are lying. You took a guess and were wrong. Later you forgot who had said it and ended up arguing with yourself. What a pathetic joke you are.<br>
<br>
Then, just to double my pleasure . . . ONCE AGAIN you try to change my words. NO ONE said slavery was our saving grace. Why do you keep attacking me on things i never said? It was a linchpin of our country at the time of its founding. THAT is what I said.  I said that Hamilton as our first Secretary of the Treasury and the man who prepared the first report on our nation's finances, business and commerce, was uniquely qualified to assess slavery's place of import in our nation at its founding. This has nothing to do with his personal opinion of slavery. If I wasnt afraid of exposing him to a sicko loser like you, I would just let my 10 year old nephew continue with this. It would be just as onesided. <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

maybe someone else can help me with this. Wouldnt someone who admits he has nothing to say but posts ad nauseum with the self stated intent of annoying and occupying others' time be considered a troll?  Since I dont speak Dal's cool guy talk, I am asking someone for help on this one. From what I gather, Dal just pretty much identified himself as a troll. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I see you followed the advice and came back to your troll trap.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
well, yes,  except that it is YOUR trap. To me it is a thread on a message board. Unlike YOU my sole purpose in being here is NOT to annoy. Not to deny others their right to post and enjoy the boards. SO I took your petty little obsession with me back to this thread so that you could continue to get your rocks off without annoying those who dont want you dragging your pissing match all over the board.<br>

If you really have a job and are working now . . . dont they mind the sticky keyboard you leave after getting your perverse pleasure out of annoying other people while you are supposed to be working?<br>

NOt only is that a lie, it is not your determination to make. I may post as much as I want as long as it is within the rules of the board. I am SURE that your posts with admitted sole intent of annoying other posters are NOT within the rules of the board, but they show very clearly what kind of loser you are. Nice logic though. You think I post too much so you decide to trap me into posting even more . . . yup  you are some genius.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Your cheating comment is laughable.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
maybe my comment is laughable but your need to cheat to win a message board flame is pathetic.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; you must know what all I'm thinking the same way you know what all the founding fathers were&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No, actually i had to read many books which included their private letters to know what they were thinking. You are much more obvious. See, they were deep thinkers . . . you are just deep doo doo<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;As far as the faction comment.. you should have looked it up when you were trying to find out what ostracize meant. It means a clique.. or a group of people if that is easier for you to understand.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
well, you did come up with part of the definition of faction so I guess that shows improvement on your part.  Just like you cant leave out or change words in my statements, you cant leave out parts of a word's definition. but I will give you partial credit for that one. You tried your best I am sure<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;That includes the servicemen that risk their ass so you can run that little mouth of yours&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
 again you try to put words in my mouth. I never offended them, just you. And you are here trying to deny people their rights so I am sure they would be ashamed at that from one of their own. Question-  Were you the ass they risked?  if so they sure werent risking much.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;people who were informed by you that their religeon was outdated because we have refrigeration now&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again . . . all together now . . . That is not what I said so stop making things up. I keep trying to focus this mess and you keep insisting on generalizing.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;As far as a drain on society.. I had a full scholarship as a pre-med student lined up when I went into the marines. I did my duty first (you should try it sometime) and got my college education after I got out.

LOL     you get caught being wrong in every single factual post you make and DARE to talk about people who dont know what they are talking about?    wow    some set of balls you have. <br>
<br>
Of course I remember. You seem to think that because you pay taxes today, that negates the impact of the Whiskey Rebellion. Another example of you stating things smugly as if they had ANY bearing on the issue at hand.<br>
<br>
Is this the fabrication you put on your resume?   You have been caught lying so many times now, you dont really expect us to believe this one do you? You have equally no idea of who I am, yet you have been down in the mud attacking me personally since you came here to trap me. When I get down in the mud with you, all of a sudden you cry foul? pretty woosy move for a big tough marine isnt it?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I could work the morning shift (in the computer command center for a major credit card company) but the night pays much better. I was on day shift for over a year before I decided to change to this shift. Money will do that to you.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
LOL  that figures. Probably at First USA. I remember how messed up their call centers were when they tried to get off PS2 workstations. LOL   the internal folks were so clueless they had to call in outside consultants. Care to guess who that was?  Isnt computer command center a little fancy term for help desk? You sure do have a way of stroking that ego of yours.  Hmmm what were those big 3rd party servers that routed the calls to each center and then on to each operator?  Ask some of the techies from that vendor what happened when they let the internal IT guys on those systems. Thanks  you are always good for a laugh. If on the other hand you are at Capital One, kudos to you. Their systems guys are top notch. Of course my familiarity with that industry is years old and limited to those two companies. But Ill bet First USA is still messed up.<br>
<br>
As for what money will do to a person . . .  That sounds like the first honest statement you have made for your motivations since this thread started. Dont include me in your little dollar lust though.  I have a pretty good record of turning down big bucks that came with a lifestyle altering change.<br>
<br>
<br>
Trouble with you is that you want your cake and to eat it too.   You try to compete on the factual front and are way outclassed (no brag . . . just fact) and so you lower it to the mindless verbal sparring level. When I follow you down . . . you run and cry about character attacks and offending factions. Cant you find any level where you can play on a level playing field? Maybe next you will threaten to have your pixels beat up my pixels?  <p>I think, therefore I am . . .

Here monkey monkey monkey. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umerentha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merentha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/29/02 6:10:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3444.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Troll wars...

I can tell how critical that monitoring must be and how much production work you must do by all the time you spend on this board while at work.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Most of that is the same nonsense you've been spouting so I'll bypass replying to it.&gt;&gt;<br>
