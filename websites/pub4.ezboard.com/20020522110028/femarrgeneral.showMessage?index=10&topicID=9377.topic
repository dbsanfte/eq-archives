woot! i don't feel like i'll be wasting 15 points then that could be spent elsewhere. at one point i had my druid to 200 wis without anything special (including gebs) but its not likely again. wis and int casters are sooooooooooo different when it comes to gear, i'm still getting back into that mode. but its good to know that i just didn't pull that out of thin air. ;&gt;<br>

i told secardius last night after reading posts here and on the mage boards that i'm going inny - i just think it sucks that he hates you even though you love him and goody two shoes tunare loved my druid because she worshipped her. <br>

So if that holds true, anything over 200 is still a waste until you ding 51.<br>

I really dont think it will make any real difference if you worship Inny or go agnostic-do what you feel like.  The gear that worshipping Inny will allow you to wear is not all that great anyhow, and is easily replaced by other gear.  As for starting stats, well, depends on if you are planning on playing this mage to 60 and what kind of guild/raids you plan on doing.  Int is not that huge a difference pre 50-especially if your twinking anyhow-but post 50 int is useful when you put on resist gear and still want to have respectable int.  Myself, when i started 3 years ago, i maxed int and put a couple into sta and agi.  If i had it to do over again,i would max int and put all the rest into sta, tho its not a big difference anyhow.  If you want to be a little different, split the points between int and sta, if your twinking it wont matter for the first 50 lvls anyhow, and by the time you get post 50 your gear will matter more then where you put your initial points.  Your god choice will not affect geting your focus items-unless your god can make the rare stuff drop faster <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I dont play a whole lot anymore, but if you see me online i think i still have some stuff for the focus items that you can have. I dont know what lvl pets the focus items help, i was lvl 40ish when the focus items came into game, and even then i cant say i ever saw a big difference using the focus items, but it makes you feel better to think they are making that pet an animal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

Well really, a good worshiper of Innoruuk would hate him, not love him. =) They would worship him for other reasons, primarily the promise of power.<br>
<br>
As for Tunare, well it would be easy to hop into a philosophical debate about exactly what a worshipper does for them, and the feelings of the deity for their followers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But I suspect that it would be rather long winded, and a lot of people would simply not be interested. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1) i want to thank everyone for the responses, as i said, i went inny. (for power not love! haha. :p i'll look into that, i keep forgetting that inny does NOT = love, unicorns, flowers. inny is NOT tunare. :/ its gonna be hard, but i can do it. ;&gt;)<br>
<br>
2) thankyou to greell/reyia and domminique for the offers in gear, i actually have everything for myself, emrian (secardius) is only missing legs (just a simple pair of silversilk leggings) and GEBS. he's going to port his druid twink around for a bit for money for those two items. GEBS are sold everyday, however the legs are another story. he found my pair finally, so if anybody has an extra pair laying around, we'd be more than happy to pay going price. we seemed to do very well, i had lluna and my warrior twink's gear to sell. emrian's warrior was sac'ed down to 46 bringing a decent hunk of money, and his armour was all sold. in the long run both of our int casters are very much better equiped than our old mains. (haha. ironic, however, a lot of it had to do with luclin items.) again, thankyou so so very much, i've updated the magelo profiles, so please take a look and tell me how we did - we went for armour that would last until at least planer level. (i've been told that int casters don't need &quot;armour&quot; like a melee does - but its always nice to upgrade ;&gt;)<br>
<br>
magyk - thankyou for the info on the focus items. they start effecting pets post-24, but actually start doing &quot;notable&quot; difference 34+. i havn't read tooooooo much about the items as of yet - however, any help in questing would be appreciated. :&gt; if you don't mind parting with the quest items. i've never been to nejena (?) &gt;: so it will be a challenge. and i got the final advice to put my 5 extras into STA. (others have said that - i put my 5 on my druid into AGI and i wish i would have STA instead &gt;:)<br>
<br>
<br>
3) now, i realise that these characters (mine at least, emrian is only sitting at 197 int) won't benefit from the 20 extra points of int they have. i wasn't trying to see just how much int i could get, it just sorta ended up that way. i went from int/mana/fashion/hp/ac in that order. (haha, i'm not joking about fashion :p i like to be pretty ingame as well as RL :p) i just hope that when she gets a little older it won't take her forEVER to med back all that pure mana :| but if it does - its my own fault :p <br>
<br>
4) if i've forgotten anything (gear wise/faction/etc) please post back and let me know. it probably sounds as if i'm running a mage/necro bootcamp here, but fun to me is having a character that can live up to the best of her class/ability. any pointers on where to level up, etc would be appreciated as well. its been a long time since i raised a newbie in the nek/EC location and i'm looking to get out of there ASAP - yet still staying within an hour on foot running range to get back to train/bank since i'm evil and qeynos catacombs hates me. &gt;: <br>
<br>
phew! i've been in the car for 16 out of the last 32 hours, i've had a lot of time to think about this. :p haha. i'm not usually this rambly. :x okay, maybe i am. ;&gt;<br>
<br>
edit : bleh, i put inny = love, etc not DOES NOT! haha. :p <p><center>
