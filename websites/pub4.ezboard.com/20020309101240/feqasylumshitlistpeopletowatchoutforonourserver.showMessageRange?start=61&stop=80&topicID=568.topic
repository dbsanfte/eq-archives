I did not bring your name here to bring flames to it, i brought it here because you would not listen to anyone in game, you would not take the /ignore command as a hint. People say they asked you to leave them alone many times, i tried to talk to you about it. You would not listen. You can think i brought you here cause i'm out to get you and i only have malicious intent, you seem to enjoy playing the victim, and the martyr. For this i'm sorry, and i do agree with Kailya, you seem to have a lot of issues IRL that only you can resolve. Maybe you're having trouble coping with something?

I would like to say that I am not, nor are most of the others playing anything out. The person bringing the huge 'playing out' of anything is Nom. I can understand he feels he needs to defend himself, but he's starting to sound panicked about things, and no offense nom, but you're getting more and more incoherent with each post, which is never a good sign. If you feel ready to defend yourself you really should do so calmly instead of name calling, blaming people or accusing everyone of lying. Acting this way only makes you seem more guilty than anyone could have written you off as. Don't make a show, make a point.<br>
<br>
I'm not here to create drama, i'm here because this is the shitlist, and this is where you post your story and name of the person you feel needs to be avoided. The fact that other females have come forth and said anything let's me know at least to a degree that i'm not insane, i'm not just imagining my guildmembers concerns, and i am not blowing them out of proportion. <br>
<br>
If you're here to flame him do that on your personal time, i did not post this to be a flame war. I posted it to get a message across to the lanys community. This guy acts and seems unstable.<br>
<br>
As for talking to him, people have tried. It is his choice what he does from here, but i definately hope it has something to do with changing the way he treats women, as it seems those are the ones who get the brunt of his harsher and stranger (if not uncalled for) actions. <br>
<br>
As far as i am concerned he belongs up here to warn others before they jump into his llittle mind game, trap, whatever you want to call it.  <p><center><img src="http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/jumping.gif" width="50" height="50"><img src="http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/xianle.gif" width="233" height="49"><img src="http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/tarepanda.gif" width="50" height="50"><br><img src="http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/whipaeka.gif" width="372" height="278"><br><font color="#FF00FF" size=3 face="Abadi MT Condensed Light">59th Season Ranger Princess.....Nyaa!<br></font><font color="#8080C0" size="2" face="Tempus Sans ITC">"Well, whatever it is you're not doing... go don't do it somewhere else!"</font>

<br>
as to the issue... i just can't lock this yet.  i'd like people to refrain from -telling- Nomaru what to do RL.. we don't know him, we're not psychologists/psychiatrists, and we're not going to help by saying stuff like that.<br>
<br>
I would like to suggest that Nomaru perhaps put EQ into perspective... a lot of this drama is easily avoidable if you don't put so much of your life into it.  Certainly, you should leave Xian le and all of her guildmates alone.  no more tells.  to this nand person, to xian le, to whoever else.<br>
<br>
i would like very much nomaru if you would just take a break from EQ... do that RL thing a bit... you've gone so deep you're rambling in your posts, youre irritable and haughty... you're just way too involved.<br>
<br>
as to this post... i'm not sure it belongs on the shitlist.  i might consider moving it to R&amp;R seeing as then i don't have to touch it.  once its in R&amp;R... it's pretty much FFA aside from real blatant violations =P<br>

I never harassed her, simply talked.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IF she didn't want to talk to me, there is ignore command and she knows that, and so do all of you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Anyway.

Only thing that still bothers me is what you posted Xianle about me and nandy, but i told you the way it was.  I didn't harass her, i just talked to her, though lately i coudln't tell anymore who it was her, or her hubby /shrug.  He plays her often.  They tell me to go away and put me on ignore i leave.  Next day i'm off ignore /shrug.  Either way.  I won't talk to her or any of your guildies again.  sorry. <p><center><i> Do not ssssssstep on my tail....</i> </center>

   He goes by many names such as, Nomaru, Akashae, kuraiame, Inspiration, Vindication, Whilma, and his many other names.....he is the same person under all of these names. This is my first post and it's a good one. So here goes, It all started a long time ago.....in June 2001. I was fighting in oasis and he begged me to group with him. So, I did. He then was very friendly to me, seemed like a nice kid. As time progressed, everytime I logged on, he was there, sending me constant tells and following me around. I was in a huge group in Cazic and me and one of my guild memebers were making jokes on each other and Inspiration got mad....claimed I am his women and no can talk to me like that. We all started laughing at his silliness but the game went on. My RL husband and I share an account, meaning that yes, he sometimes plays my character...we'll one night my husband was playing my character and Inspiration got mad and demanded for my husband to get off with my character or return all of the gear that he gave me. He gave me some nice gear in the beginning for free, as a gift. I did not know that giving someone gear meant that they owned you. He cussed and threatened my husband. This is the first time he had been reported and petitioned. My story is so long, it would take a week to tell all, so, I am getting to the most recent problem. He stalks my husbands characters, my characters, my real life sisters characters, my friends in the game, and most of all my guild. He will send messages to a certain person, guy friend in the guild, that he is jealous of, telling him to tell Nandy that he loves her. Now, this game is for fun, not to hear messages that some guy says he loves you. I love my real life husband and I would never leave him for a toon. I am tired of dealing with Nomaru. So, here goes once and for all because I am sure that you will read this. I love my husband, I don't know you, you will quit this childish stalking game that you play on me and all that I know, You should apologize to the entire Nyaa guild for your rude comments to Xianle and Lista. Xianle and Lista are two of the best people I have ever met in this game. They are great, so you leave them alone too. No more cussing at me, no more telling me that you are going to post bad things about my character on the forums, no more telling me that you will degrade my characters name, no more sending me messages, no more of anything. I will continue to record, report, and petition you everytime you talk to me in the game. I will not put any of your characters on ignore becasue I am sending your nasty, rude comments straight to the gms everytime you harass me. Oh, and by the way, he has asked me for my real life phone number and saying we need to meet in real life. Now, for anyone who can't understand how much crap he has put me through in this game, please talk to me one on one in the game. There is just to much to say. He also will make a new character to try to get me just to talk to him, and when I don't, he cusses at me calling me names. I warn any female that encounters him. Beware, for he who seems nice is evil in disguise. Thanks to all who read this and to my guild for all of your support. Nyaa really is a great guild!!!  Nyaa!! Oh, and one other thing, he changed his last name in the guild to mine, said we were now married....and if anyone sees his character, click on him and read his message box....He claims he is married to Nandanine and Serrpenta.....Serrpenta is one of my chars...I am not married to him, but he claims he is married to both of my characters. Thanks again for reading my message.                <br>

  This thread is very scary, if you have an issue with this guy talk to him one on one.<br>
  You are not dealing with someone that needs to be shitlisted.  This is a psychological issue and needs to be dealt with in a more private forum.<br>

You can hack my account all you want but it will not work. My account password has been changed. Why dont you tell everyone that you posted stuff about my character without my persmisson, tell everyone how you created a hotmail account under my name, tell everyone how you tried to be me by sending people emails with my name, you really are a head case. You told me a long time ago that you could change anything in this game to read the way you wanted it. By the way, Nomaru claims to be a computer gooroo with the ability to arranged stuff the way he wants. Now, I know that my husband would not tell you he loves you., and if you told my husband you loved him, well, you really do need help man. You can post and rearrange what ever you would like. You can make it appear that my character has said whatever you want, but here goes, I have a lot of proof and witnesses to your actions. You don't scare me. My entire family plays this game, and they all know how you stalk me and what you do. You stalk my sister, you stalk me, and my husband, and my cousin. Don't you get it? We would love for you to leave us all alone. I never told you or asked you to help my sister. I would not dare put her in the hands of you. Why would I need your help anyway? Like I said my entire family plays this game, and they are all very high level characters. I have not and do not need you in anyway shape or form. So, don't send me any tails, quit posting stuff on the forums using my characters name, and quit making email accounts using my name, and stop your obessesion with me now and for all. I really think you have some real life issues at hand. My real life profession is in the medical field and I really want to advise you to seek immediate help before you hurt others and yourself. This has gone way out of hand. I am going to trade accounts with a family member so that I can get away from Nomaru, or whoever you are at the time. You will not be able to find me. So, farewell and leave me alone. I am calling game headquarters to discuss this issue. For all whom read this, don't bother replying to this kid. It will not help, it will only turn out to be a huge war of the words. My final words are, all who know me, thanks for all of your help and I will contact you with my new characters. I know that I will not be able to get away from this sick kid unless I change my account. I will see you all soon, all but You nomaru. I don't care what crap you talk about my character and what all you rearrange to suit your emotional needs. The game ends here and now. Nomaru and all of his characters are deleted to my existence.   Also, if you try to hack my account again, I will report you and take legal action upon you. I mean real life legal action. If you can't understand this, call your local police department or legal office and look up information on hackers.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhsianlichen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hsian Li Chen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/12/01 10:12:18 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindication..imean..nomaru...i mean Inspiration..i mean.</span><hr size=1> i have edited the post by Vindication containing very personal and private correspondance between two people who were under the illusion of confidence.<br>
<br>
i will now explain why.<br>
<br>
i got an e-mail from nomaru (vindication) this morning with those very logs, which to him, prove that Nand 'loves' him.  he asked me to swear not mentioning them, not to tell anyone about these logs, not to post them; he gave them to me just to explain his side.<br>
<br>
not more than 3 hours later, i see those very logs posted by himself.  i'm putting a halt to this.<br>
<br>
here by decree of Xian the Tyrant (C)Arios2001:<br>
<br>
#1 - under no circumstances are logs and screenshots of a personal nature that were given under the illusion of confidence and trust to be posted on this messageboard.  This board is not to promote or to antagonize the already soap-oprea-y nature of these threads.<br>
<br>
#2 - anyone violating this order on this thread or others on this topic involving these people will be banned from the messageboards PERMANENTLY. (more importantly, if you want to know if something is appropriate... ask me, ok?)<br>
<br>
#3 - this thread will be locked soon, and i've decided to leave it here.  after experiencing the 'nomaru whirlwind' i know exactly what Xian Le means.  he is playing head games and EXTREMELY bordering on severe stalking here.  He has hurt far more people than other people i've banned from the messageboards.  at the point of locking it, i will edit the title to include the known characters of Nomaru.<br>
<br>
#4 - i will not lock it immediately. if you have major problems with it or feel i'm being rude or whatever, please let me know.  hsian_li@yahoo.com or post here<br>
<br>
the reason for all this:  STOP THE DRAMA!  Vind, just walk away.  Xian Le et. al, use 3 very important commands:<br>
1) /ignore &lt;name&gt;<br>
if he creates a new character/logs on another:<br>
2) /report &lt;name&gt; <br>
3) /petition i have instructed &lt;name&gt; not to talk to me and put him on my ignore filter. he is now logging onto other characters to talk to me and i cannot prevent this.<br>
<br>
my decision to suspend/ban posters to this messageboard is arbitrary and my own. i do not want to do this, i do not want to be so firm and mean, but this shit has to stop.<br>
<br>
Xian-monkie-not-the-Nyaa-princess-Xian-Le-so-THERE!<br>
<br>
p.s.  i'm going to suggest to Nomaru/Vind the very same thing i just e-mailed him, in the hopes he reads it soon.<br>

First its funny how fast nom changed his story.  Second nom you are a fucking sycho.  You really need help.  And to nand I am so sorry that you had to go through all of that with that stupid nut case.  just /report him if he does it again then send a gm a direct tell till they anwser and tell them that you have to talk to frizz soon and tell them what is going on.  I am sure even though as useless as gms are they would react to something like that very fast if you send a direct tell instead of waiting for a petition.  And if frizz is online explain to the gm what is going on and he most likely will tell frizz right away seeing how this goes into RL issues which is much more important then the game.  If they ignore you say you got to log soon and don't ave time to wait for a petition.  It worked for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .
