 Public forums for guild issues makes the guild seem lame.<br>
<br>
 Any guild that deserves decent folk will at least check the characters prior guild history and would uncover this event anyway.<br>
<br>
 Guilds that come to the public forums to talk about in guild issues are commiting a far worse crime than gating and causing a 3 hour CR.<br>

As far as buying my account on ebay. that is so funny. send a tell to glagg or bullvai. ( same RL person on emarr) He was the won e that got me started on EQ. so to acuse me of buying my account is funny. I try my best at all I do. and so far being guildles hasnt bothered me. i have learned more without a guild. mastered all speeches minus frog, gob, old eruidite and kobalt which i need to get kobalt. just the other day i gave away 2 stacks of fuzle ctter 500, a stack of liquified grobb meat, mass stat foods over 500 pp worth. so i try to help out when i can and as much as i can even at the cost of me going broke. before i tarted playing EQ i was playing Betrayal at Krondor.  if i wasnt getting the blamed then why flame me. i camped as soon as i gated to save my hide from the messed up hole raid.  and so you all know i have gotten guild invites but they didnt match the requirements. from of coures bludysky's guild, ICoN among others.  Ka will be a mid level guild with its head in the clouds dreaming of the day that they can do the good raids. you can also send tell to purescale 50 monk we have grouped before. I would have never known you people were blasting me had  a poster on this not sent me a tell. you know who you are.  it wouldnt surprise me one bit if they threatrened the current guildees of being deguilded if they grouped with me. that is ok swords of sacriface also invited me too because i had hlped them in the past on many occasions. as i had helped on the last known ragefire raid that was the storms of dragon guild so regardless of being in a guild or not is totally 100% irrevaluant. yes most time i ask whats in it for me. if no prize at that time i get offered a guild favor with that guild soregardless if i get picked up a by a guild or not :P<br>
<br>
yes i have a few dreams as far as EQ is concerned. 1: learn all the different kinds of speech so you people couldnt say lies without me knowing what you are saying.<br>
<br>
2: some day be good enough  to apply to magister. but that is a ways off still.<br>
<br>
when i was lv 50 or 51 cant remember. i was in Ka. and can you guess what? when in a zone with guildees that had room for me where we could grp and no one lost exp. they refused to let me in so that says alot about  Ka too. that particulr lv took me almost 9 months to get cause i had to solo 95% of it. some guild  to this day i would still buff Ka members. even those who are talking a lot of BS but if their 56 shaman is on go get the better shaman buffs.<br>

As a matter of fact I was looking for Shantara so that I could pull the mobs off her so that she could evac us if needed.  Of course you were prolly too busy learning your &quot;speeches&quot; to be bothered to pay attention to what was going on around you.  Since you weren't slowing, and we had buffed up prior to zoning in, and really there had been no reason for you to cast a spell for like 10 minutes or more, why were you so low on mana, and nothing had been slowed???  Way to go sparky, your skill as a shaman knows no bounds.<br>
<br>
And as for all the wonderful neat and keen things you have been doing since the night of the incident.  Whoppity fvcking do.  OJ was a good football player and he was really funny in the Nakid Gun movies do you think that makes his dead wife feel any better?<br>
<br>
I guess I will have to say this again.<br>
<br>
You were booted for logging off and leaving your guild mates in the lurch.  You were booted for being a selfish prick.<br>
<br>
If a guild chooses to invite you after having this knowledge that is their loss.<br>
<br>
Ghie - I guess we will just have to disagree on this.  A guild's dirty laundry would be a member coming here and posting about someone in the guild getting special treatment from the officers, or that someone in the guild sent naughty tells.  Coming to these public forums(as an officer of the guild) to warn the public about the misdeeds of a person who has been removed from the guild is the same idea as the scammer section.<br>

I have no RL emotional ties to ka. i have no GF or wife and my daughter is only 4. so to leave them because i feel that i have out grown them isnt out of the ordinary.  but what good would a lv 54, 56  and anyone higher then 45 or so be doing in a guild with mostly 30s or abouts that. not to mention at any given time no more then 5 or 6 on. yes i know that he school year has stared and that can account for some but during the summer most i saw on from ka was 5 or 6. except for the arena deal. after all when was the lat time you ever saw a guild of lv 20 - 30 get to the top of  ToFS. that is a rather hard task to do at that lv. i saw it once. about 4 months ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 782<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 8:57:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3663.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mid lv guild</span><hr size=1> paragraphs are your friend.<br>

<br>
lets do the math <br>
3 malosi 175 each =525<br>
3 cripples 225 each = 675<br>
3 turgurs insects 250 each = 750<br>
so that total comes to 1950 mana<br>
my personal mana pool is 2040 total that left me 90 mana and gate takes 70 mana. leaving me 20 mana points what was i suspossed to do? cannibalize at 74 hp a time and already at 25% hp from the debuffs yea right.<br>
 shantara should have gated and ran back you should have BSed the imp protectors. and no then i didnt know all the speechs i know now. you are just a jelouse, person that cant stand that the fact that you died and i lived. you lost more exp then you gained and i lost none. just like a theif. hide and  expect others to cleap up your mess. not all rogues are that way i have to add. just like all druids arent as oblivious to the gate spell. that is one spell i have up any time i go into a zone that i can die in. gate is a casters last resort of escape sink or swim, do or die.<br>
<br>
its not my fault that there was a suicidal shaman, inempt druid,  now the cleric did a great job. i have to admit. i saw 4 complete heals on the pally. but when things got to the point of no return all casters should have gated. i know CHs cost mass mana. i recieved no heals or cast none as i didnt have the mana. so no one was looking out for me but me. to blast me for saving my hide when no one else had or was. who abondandon who.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 785<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 9:38:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3663.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: yes you were afk</span><hr size=1> Any player that has Gate memmed while raiding is a N00B.

In the process of failing valiantly is where much of the comraderie of being a team is developed. Ideally the occasional victory against the odds is the holy grail of team building.<br>

<br>
Logging after gating because you can't be bothered to act like the rest of decent humanity = Pretty friggin stupid.<br>
<br>
If you put in an investment into a raid, especially in a place like the Hole where CR's can be kinda a b!tch, it is somewhat assumed that you will not squeal, take your toys, and run home when things get complicated.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was I supposed to do?&quot;  Gate or die, doesn't really matter.  Its the logging thing afterwords that is what makes you an azz.  You stick around to help the folks who went down with you, and because they are in your guild, you cut them a little slack if they didn't raid awesomely.  You knew the type of people they were before the raid, and you have no excuse whining about a death as your justification for leaving your guildmates in the lurch.  I personally know folks (myself included) who die at least once on a fair number of raids.  Heck, I know pullers who absolutely get reamed xp-wise because the stuff they are pulling is so nasty.  You suck up the death, get back in there, and if there is criticism to be made, make it after the raid when everyone else is out and accounted for.<br>
<br>
Stuff got messy, and you panicked and split, and followed it up by slinking off.  That really is the jist of it, and whether or not there were folks overslowing or what your mana situation wasa doesn't really come into play. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.

<br>
If you want to play the highend game, and someone yells &quot; Clerics Camp&quot; I think it would behoove you to try and take agro from the cleric and DIE!! So that the cleric can safely get out of there.<br>
<br>
Yes, on raids YOU DIE!! So that the important ones can live. You throw yourself between the MOB and the important ones (generally clerics), and take the beating. <br>
<br>
Again, YOU DIE! There is no gating on many a raid Ive been too, in fact, your a tool if you even have it mem'd.<br>
<br>
Clerics First, FD'ers save their own bacon to help with CR but generally make sure cleric is out safe. Everyone else DIES to allow clerics to camp out.<br>

oh and BTW, I have known all languages for 'bout 40 levels now, and not once have I had to use them...other than to goof off. So, regarding the language skills, its kinda like having alcohol tolerance maxed...doesnt really do a damn thing for you. (especially if your not a research class)<br>

<br>
I never have gate memmed during any exp group or raid, EVER.  I am a caster, I have no twinks (besides some level 10 folks I like to dress up pretty).  And I'm also a shaman, one of the classes that can make a bad pull turn out okay.  You dissed root parking, but it is a viable tactic in a CC situation without a mezzing class.  You had 2 shaman a cleric and a paladin, no one was rooting?  <br>
<br>
This might come as a bit of a shock to you, but very few of us received any free handouts on the climb up.  <br>
<br>
Most of us started back in the painful days when you made your own leather armor, prayed for banded and bronze was special.  A lot of us made tough choices over which spells to buy, saved up for backpacks and wore stuff like gold rings looted from mobs because we didn't know any better (okay, but it wasn't for very long!)<br>
<br>
High level people didn't get to be high level with nice gear by just standing around waiting for the Nice Gear Fairy to show up and do some free handouts!<br>
<br>
You're still new to the upper game, learning your role in a group, learning what it is expected of you as a group mate and a guild mate.  Hopefully you have learned that it is considered VERY bad form in a group to gate out of a group and then CAMP without helping with CR.  It is considered VERY bad form in a guild, to camp out without helping the people who are supposed to be able to count on you!<br>
<br>
Don't ever stop expanding beyond what people think is a shaman's role (do more than buff and debuff), you should really send Snoww a tell and ask her what is a shaman's role!  If you'd saved some of that mana you WASTED on cripple (yes, WASTED) you should have had plenty for enough roots to keep 2 of those mobs off the group.<br>
<br>
You said rooting was a poor tactic for crowd control, I use it constantly.  I love rooting 3-4 mobs, all dotted, slowly cooking while we melee them down one by one, by the time we reach mob 4, it's nearly dead!  <br>
<br>
You definitely picked the best class (severe bias here), now it's time to go find out why we're so great, it ain't because we gate out on bad pulls.<br>
<br>
Finally, trust me, if you want to experience the high end game with an excellent, close knit raiding guild like Magister, you should listen to what's been posted here.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kilmal>kilmal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 10:51:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3663.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> what could i do</span><hr size=1> You tell me what good would i have been.

If the 56 shaman was there, why were you slowing?<br>
<br>
2) That comment about the heals is pathetic.  Seriously.  <br>
<br>
3) You wasted a TON of mana on malosi and cripple (two spells I NEVER use in a typical exp group).    <br>
<br>
4) You still aren't getting it, shaman are a wonderful jack of all trades type character.  We CAN use root parking as a form of primitive crowd control.  We CAN choose to wear high AC/hitpoint gear that allows us to take some hits like a melee (in most exp groups I don't even stop using can 4 (148 hitpoints a pop) while a mob is beating on me) we CAN use our heals to act as a healer (we are one of the the three priest classes!!)<br>
<br>
If I had been in that situation (dungeon I don't know, grouped with a cleric, paladin, druid, rogue and another shaman stuck in a pit someplace) I would have used root to control the adds and acted as a back up healer.  Since I would have saved nearly 1000 mana by not wasting it on malosini and cripple, I might have put on some dots, that would keep the mob's attention on me.  If they break root, I just walk them back over where I want them and re-root them.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and I would have been cannabalizing like crazy.  Most overpulls, I end fights with more mana than I started (and this dates back to before big mana return spell combos like can IV/V/torpor).  I probably wouldn't have meleed, it's not really my thing, although a lot of other shaman really enjoy it.   <br>
<br>
If I had died, I would have consented the rogue to drag my body and waited for the cleric to rez me.<br>

Irrelevant, it really doesn't matter where you are, the basic principles of grouping remain the same.  The mobs might have new pixels and a few more hitpoints, but basically, mobs act the same while exping in Crushbone or exping in Sol B or exping in Sraa temple.  <br>

Yes, in an exp situtation (especially one without an enchanter so you could be expected to help CC and haste) I think cripple is a complete and utter waste of time.  <br>

You had no chanter or bard, and I'm telling you that root can be quite viable.  I use it ALL THE TIME successfully.  Who cares if something breaks root, root it again!  Use one of the upgrades which has a chance to last longer.<br>

We are what the group needs, just think on that for awhile.  Your group needed a back up healer and some sort of CC, you wasted a thousand mana on cripple/malosi and then gated out.  You didn't think through the situation, you didn't react to the special needs of that group, you demonstrated poor flexibility and skill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 787<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/26/02 11:27:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3663.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: you dont want to be bothered</span><hr size=1> Kilmal,<br>
 You know nothing about the high end game. The only way I can explain you even having a level higher than 12 is that you soloed most of your life.<br>
  I hope you liked soloing because, thanks to your eloquent words, you will not likely find a guild that will take you in again.<br>
  I started the game in patchwork just like everyone. Did it three times actually. The fact that I now have an army of very twinked twinks is testament to work(ok so its really play) I put into my main. <br>
 As I said, you know NOTHING about the high end game and it looks like you never will.<br>
