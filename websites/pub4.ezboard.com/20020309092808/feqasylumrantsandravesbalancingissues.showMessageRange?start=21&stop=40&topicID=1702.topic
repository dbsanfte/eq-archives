Not gonna even try and defend a lot of the bullshit Ted Turner does, but this statement is completely untrue.  He's right at the top of the largest charitable donors list (top 2 or 3, I know Bill Gates is ahead of him) and among his recent donations was a 1 Billion (yes, billion) dollar gift, fully one third of his net worth at the time.  I would hardly call that greedy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueuripedmoped.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euriped Moped</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bored Whore</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/12/02 8:26:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1702.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/zdance.gif height=40 width=40></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turd Turner Speaks Out</span><hr size=1> I have always liked ted turner. <br>

There was no bravery in the attacks. The actions of that day were brought out by cowards who felt the need to strike at those who have done nothing to them. They decry our way of life and our culture, yet themselves practice horrible things.<br>

<br>
First of all, I despise Ted Turner.  He's just a rotten human being.  Okay, he gives a billion dolars to the UN.  Wonderful.  But:<br>
<br>
* what the hell has the UN done to promote peace?  I mean, really?  Just because a bunch of people come to New York and beat their gums about world peace doesn't mean it's gonna happen.  The majority of the UN hates the US simply because they envy our prosperity and freedom.  Do we do some godawful things?  Yes.  But we also do far more than any country you can name as far as humanitarian efforts around the world.  <br>
<br>
* if Turner is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> really</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> interested in philanthropy, he would've given in private and kept his damn mouth shut.  It's obvious that he made the donation to the UN for publicity, and to &quot;embarrass&quot; the US over the non-issue of &quot;delinquent&quot; membership dues.  If he doesn't like the way we do things, fine.  That's his right.  But don't show up your country just to suck up to a bunch of assholes in other countries.  And besides, the US wasn't delinquent.  Who do you think has been carrying the water for the UN since 1945, paying for its overseas operations, supplying the UN miltary forces, even giving up some of the most expensive land in the world for a meeting place for the world's diplomats?  Bolivia?<br>
<br>
* he's one of the biggest bigots you'll ever run across.  I'll give two examples.  He berated a bunch of CNN people bcause they held a Bible study during their off time, raving at them for being &quot;Jesus freaks&quot; and threatening their jobs if they didn't quit their religion.  Lou Dobbs was so incensed that he quit his job hosting &quot;Moneyline.&quot;  Turner also dumped Hanoi Jane when she found religion.  He blew up because she decided she'd actually like to go to church for the first time in about 30 years.  I don't have a problem if he doesn't believe in God.  But for him to rant about intolerance all the time, while being that intolerant himself, is well beyond hypocrisy.  <br>
<br>
As others have said, Turner has made an ungodly amount of money in his lifetime.  He's one of the most astute businessmen of the last century.  You have to respect that.  But that doesn't change the fact that the man is a raving lunatic.  Other countries may hate us, and the majority of the world's population will never make as much money as a typical American welfare recipient.  Not to be rude, but so what?  We do our best to feed and clothe the world.  What country has done as much for the way people dress, eat, act toward one another, etc., in the last 50 years?  Granted, that's a double-edged sword because some of our customs really aren't exemplary.  But we've done our best.  What have America's critics done to help the starving people in Africa, or to stop the millennia-old fighting in the Middle East?<br>
<br>
The sons of bitches who attacked America deserved to die.  They were cowards.  They disagreed with other people, and decided the best way to resolve the dispute was to kill thousands of innocent people.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> There is no way anyone can justify this unless they're either totally evil, absolutely insane, or both.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  While Turner was no doubt looking for publicity, what he said was so wrong, so totally fucked (beg pardon), that the guys from Belleview should be sent to his office before he hurts anyone.  There is no way anyone can defend what he said on the merits of his words.  If you do, you're trying to justify mass murder.  And to me, that's like trying to justify the Holocaust because Hitler had a problem with the Jews' religion.  If Turner had said anything like that, would anyone be defending him? <br>
<br>
Now, to address something else that has popped up in this post.  The next person to jump Adjani over her opinions gets a flaming wrench up his ass.  I personally disagree with a lot of her opinions here.  But she's entitled to state her opinions freely without being beaten to death.  More importantly, she's one of the sweetest people I know, and I won't stand for people clubbing one of my friends over politics.  Now, maybe I could see it if she blew a mez.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Seriously though, lay off, okay?    <br>

<br>
First of all the pilots KNEW they were going to die and they died for their cause, yes they died attacking america which is the dumbest thing  anyone could ever do but thats what the grew up believing was right and proper. They have a sick sense that they are fighting for freedom when they do this. They were in no way shape or form justified in their attack but doing something KNOWING your going to die from it isn't cowardice<br>
<br>
Second as revealed in the Osama video only the pilots knew what was really going on, all the other terrorists thought it was a regular hijacking. They didnt know they were going to kill thousands of innocent people. Yes i know hijacking in and of itself is still one of the shittyest things a human could possibly do, but hijacking and crashing a plane into a fucking building are very diferent<br>
<br>
Ok now remember my comments are ONLY about the people on the planes Osama is a coward because he would never sacrafice himself for his cause although he tricks other people into it.

I guess what im trying to say is someone isn't a coward just because you dont believe in what they are doing and that bravery/cowardice shouldn't be part of any of this discussion because its based on a person to person basis not what a group choses to do with its members <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umendan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mendan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 5:21:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1702.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turd Turner Speaks Out</span><hr size=1> Soory, but for a moment I have to play devil's advocate.

Guess what, your country is founded on freedom of speech and ideas. Get a grip Vanamar, your world isn't going to collapse overnight and be filled with gun-toting Taliban camel jockeys from Afghanistan because one guy spoke his mind.<br>
<br>
Do I believe in what those terrorists died for? Hell no. I want religious tolerance and some semblance of peace, not this &quot;Allah or Jihad&quot; bullshit. However, by the dictionary definition of &quot;brave&quot; you could call those terrorists brave. It's probably not the smartest thing to do in a room of right-wingers, but it's probably true on some level. <br>

It is possible to make an objective observation on a horrific event without supporting the bad guys. <p><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=81496">Dolalin</a> Bonewielder<br>

<br>
In order to save hundreds of thousands of our soldiers scheduled to invade Japan?<br>
<br>
A resounding YES is heard.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget why we were fighting that war in the first place.  We put economic sanctions on Japan because they killed 300,000 Chinese citizens in a week!  And Japan used those sanctions as a reason to say we forced THEM into a war!<br>
<br>
I would trade 100,000 Japanese citizens for 100,000 of our soldiers, at any time and at any place, especially in a JUST war.<br>

Why did they hit the Pentagon and the WTC instead of an NFL game? They could have taken out a lot more people by hitting a staduim filled with 50,000 people than the WTC that early in the morning. Not to mention the citizens of countries other than the US who work in those buildings. They were trying to do more than just kill Americans. They were people from poor countries making a statement about capitalist business and political practices. <br>

You disagree that the attacks were an act of desperation? I don't see how you could. As for Americans lacking an understanding of a willingness to die for their country, what about the flood of enlisted people trying to get out of the armed forces immediately after 9/11, just to save their own skin? You think they understand a willingness to die for their country? I have to say that even after the attacks, there are too many Americans who are only willing to let someone ELSE die for our country.<br>

He may not be the brightest of people, but he's entitiled to his opinion. (So is his ex-wife, by the way.) It's not un-American to be opposed to government policies or to be contrary to the mainstream. To quote another non-traditionalist who opposed his government's policies:<br>

Why cant we have the economists work on this also? Maybe when somthing is discovered it could be implemented slowly without crushing the economy. The fact that we are such big consumers of oil means that in the end we fund these terrorist groups and give them power. I realize that an endeavour like that would take many years, BUT that shouldnt deterr us. This would be an endeavor worth working towards and no one should say it is impossible. Many things that we used to think were impossible are now possible and in  use.<br>
<br>
Finding an alternative that is not harmful to the environment and takes financial power from the arab countries seems like a long term goal we should be working on.<br>
<br>
Silencing those we disagree with would make us more like the Taliban than America. Wishing people dead who have an opinion different than your own is getting dangerously close to the ideals of those we oppose.<br>
<br>
Hunting down murderers is totally understandable. Punishing those who have committed crimes is ,of course, quite reasonable. Hunting down those who are conspiring to commit crimes is quite reasonable. Wishing people death who make statements you dont like, its well...so...talibanish. <br>

And in a terrorists mind they're saving thier own soldiers from having to die by commiting large scale attacks with a small amount of people.  In my opinion killing innocent people for ANY cause, war or otherwise, is wrong.  I was trying to point out that whether you like it or not we've acted in the same fashion terrorists have, and that there are many ways to look at what they've done instead of saying they're asshole chicken-shit pussy-wipes that deserve to die and leaving it at that.  The war on terrorism can't be won just by killing all terrorists, it has to involve looking from thier perspective and finding a way to change it so they see how horribly wrong they're actions are. <p><center><img src=http://members.aol.com/amergin22/myhomepage/sig.jpg><br>Wanderer of the 52nd Season-Lanys T'Vyl</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubjarkibearskin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjarki Bearskin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/13/02 8:30:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1702.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turd Turner Speaks Out</span><hr size=1> I may have misunderstood and I accept that, but my point is, I would gladly trade 100,000 innocent Japanese citizens in exchange for the probable loss of 100,000 innocent G.I.s, given the circumstances that lead to the dropping of two weapons of mass destruction.<br>
