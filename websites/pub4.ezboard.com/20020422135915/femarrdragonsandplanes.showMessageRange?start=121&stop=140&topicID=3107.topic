Second, there has been no logic applied by anyone in this post.  There are facts (or actually, fiction) spouted and opinions spewed.  When asked for more information, the result is a bunch of &quot;you sound stupid&quot; responses for disagreeing with them.  <br>
<br>
Third, and I will type this slowly for you, I do not respond because I care one whit what any liberal thinks of me, I respond because this AMUSES me.  Just like Ms. Cleo, this board is for entertainment purposes only, it is not to be taken seriously.  <br>
<br>
I mean, c'mon, who can read THIS paragraph:<br>
<br>
&quot;Why get rid of the epa, because it doesn't do its job right. For the love of God man, Last year was the first year to mankind's knowledge the North Pole melted. The government just released statistics saying every human born since 1951 has recieved radiation from nuclear testing done in Nevada and the Pacific. The Son of a Bush wants to end the endangered species list. He's cut funding for renewable resources last year, becuase they are not feasible even though Woody Harrelson toured the west coast speaking about them in a hemp oil powered bus. He's revoked rules that reduced acceptable levels of arsenic in drinking water. He has eliminated the laws to protect coral reefs which grow at about a half an inch a century. Cut funding by 28% for research into cleaner, more efficient cars and trucks. Suspended rules that would have strengthened the government's ability to deny contracts to companies that violated workplace safety, environmental and other federal laws.OK'd Interior Department appointee Gale Norton to send out letters to state officials soliciting suggestions for opening up national monuments for oil and gas drilling, coal mining, and foresting. Abandoned a campaign pledge to invest $100 million for rain forest conservation. Suspended rules that would require hardrock miners to clean up sites on Western public lands. Pulled out of the 1997 Kyoto Treaty global warming agreement. Cut Environmental Protection Agency budget by $500 million. Proposed to curtail the ability of groups to sue in order to get an animal placedon the Endangered Species List. Rescinded rule that mandated increased energy-saving efficiency regulations for central air conditioners and heat pumps. Abandoned campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide (CO2), the waste gas that contributes to global warming. Nominated David Lauriski - ex-mining company executive - to post of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health. O.K.'d Interior Secretary Gale Norton to go forth with a controversial plan to auction oil and gas development tracts off the coast eastern of Florida. Announced intention to open up Montana's Lewis and Clark National Forest to oil and drilling. Proposes to re-draw boundaries of nation's monuments, which would technicallyallow oil and gas drilling &quot;outside&quot; of national monuments. Appointed recycling foe Lynn Scarlett as Undersecretary of the Interior. Allowed Interior Secretary Gale Norton to shelve citizen-led grizzly bear re-introductionplan scheduled for Idaho and Montana wilderness. Refused to fund continued cleanup of uranium-slag heap in Utah. Proposes to reverse regulation protecting 60 million acres of national forest from logging and road building. Nominated Linda Fisher - an executive with Monsanto - for the number two job at the Environmental Protection Agency. Canceled 2004 deadline for automakers to develop prototype high mileage cars. Nominated J. Steven Giles - an oil and coal lobbyist - for Deputy Secretary of the Interior. Nominated Bennett Raley - who advocates repealing the Endangered Species Act- for Assistant Secretary for Water and Science. Proposes to ease permit process - including environmental considerations - for refinery, nuclear and hydroelectric dam construction. Washington Post, May 18, 2001. Proposes that $1.2 billion in funding for alternative renewable energy comefrom selling oil and gas lease tracts in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve. Forced out Forest Service chief Mike Dombeck and appointed a timber industry lobbyist. &quot;<br>
<br>
and not chuckle and remember the tale of Chicken Little.  (you know, the sky is falling?)<br>
<br>
<br>
and when you say this:<br>
<br>
&quot;Corporations are just pools of people's money working to produce something and give people jobs.&quot;<br>
<br>
it gets translated by liberals as:<br>
<br>
&quot;You think corporations exist to give people jobs, and you wonder why your arguements aren't going to change anyone's minds?&quot;<br>
<br>
Can any freakin liberal possibly just respond to something without filtering it and making into something else?  <br>
<br>
This statement was pointing out the use of the corporations to society, not the reason they are created by the investors.  But if you want an exercise in logic, here's one:<br>
<br>
Corporations DO exist to produce goods and give people jobs.  Anyone can just make something and sell it, government allows people to create corporations to ENCOURAGE them (through tax and liability benefits) to risk their capital.  This production does many things, but among the benefits are that it provides the people of the society with needed goods and also provides jobs.  Not everyone is going to go open a small business.  But the Ford plant would not be running if government did not CREATE corporations.   Sooooooooooo....the only reason any corporation exists is because the government lets it exist so that it will produce goods and give people jobs.<br>
<br>
No, that isn't usually the reason the owners had for making the corporation to begin with, but it is the reason it is allowed to exist at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And I'm still waiting for more info on the Northampton teachers who are on food stamps. And OBVIOUSLY we are talking about teachers working full time with 0-3 children, my flawed logic made me overlook that.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Lobbyists are thoughtfull and powerfull creatures, given to long periods of pondering the full ecological ramifications of the laws they support.  But when need be, LOBBYISTS can be forcefull and cunning, using their abilities to let the minority special interests' ideas be heard above the cacophony of the masses.<br>

And that of course has nothing to do with corporate PACs, does it?  Don't delude yourself, corporations make at least as heavy use of lobbying as anyone else, and they have more money to back it up.  <br>

Or do you really care about what I think of you?  If you do, you have very poor social skills if your continuing comments are directed at raising my opinion of you.  <br>

Falljaeger, why do you wish unpleasantness on the &quot;privileged gentry?&quot;  Because they have money they deserve to have bad things happen to them?

Hehe..i never once said that i think teach teacher's aren't underpaid. In fact, i do think they are underpaid, and i believe increasing there salary will attract a better teaching base. <br>
<br>
I, however, merely took a purely economically stance. Let me rephrase: do i personally think teachers are underpaid, yes. Does labour economic theory believe teachers are underpaid, definately not.<br>
<br>
And teachers college, i guess it doesn't exist in the US, but before you can teach any grade (elementary through high school) you must undergo 1 year of teacher's college in Canada. Entrance to teachers college every year in Canada is numerous. MANY applications are turned down. In fact, finding a job as a teacher in Canada usually now entails years of searching. <br>

If one has a HS degree, one can be a recess monitor, but that's about it.  I have a BA, therefore I work in the classroom, as a teacher.  Last year I worked 4 or 5 days a week.  This year, there are contract problems, and the teachers are working without contracts.  I'm working less than I'd like.<br>
Therefore, I have two other jobs.  I'm in the process of applying for another.  I don't think this means I'm lazy.  However, it does mean that I work when I can and don't make nearly enough to support myself.  No, I'm not on welfare, but I am also unmarried and childless.  If I made my current salary and had a child, chances are I would need food stamps, too.  "Choosing to work less," am I?  Funny, I would have thought someone with 4 jobs might be "trying to work more.<br>
Cenelron, I am clinging, against all good sense and advice, to the idea that deep down, you are intelligent enough to know that when I say teachers are underpaid, I mean "teachers" and not "teachers in outrageous circumstances."  I also believe you know 15 children is an outrageous circumstances.  (And how could anyone with 15 kids find time to work, anyway?  *grin*)  Teachers around here make $20,000 to $23,000 a year.  Many of them are supporting spouses who have been laid off due to our lousy economy.  (Please note, the economy here is terrible, however good it might be elsewhere.)  Around here, family with 2 adults is eligible for aid if their income is less than $23,000.  I never said all teachers were on food stamps, but some are.  They have 0-3 children and some are married.  Helpful?<br>
I have to wonder why you aren't picking on firefighters, too.  I believe they are underpaid.  So are the police in many cases.  This is terrible, too.  They make very little money when you think about the jobs they do.  Another underpaid group of workers -- nurses.  This isn't just about teachers.<br>
And one last note -- my "story" is none of your @#%$ business.  I don't have a sob story for you.  Do I wish I worked more often?  Yes, of course.  Do I wish I could find full-time work in my area?  Damn skippy, I do.  Do I wish I had more money?  Well, it would sure reduce some of the headaches.  However, the fact is, I'm pretty damn happy.  Shocker, huh?<br>

1. Do you have a purpose here? It started out as a debate about superfund. Now you have run to the rescue of GW less someone say something bad about our great leader. You keep running the argument off the main issue for God only knows what reasons. If your only here for entertainment and aren't going to post anything usefull toward the debate or even your own cause please just let us know now. <br>
<br>
2. Do you realize you are doing more harm than good to your cause? When I offer numbers that give both the republican and democrats estimates or figures you mock it, and yet when Zariel makes a claim you criticize her lack of numbers. Correct me if I am wrong, but I assume you are a republican. I assume this because since I disapprove of Bush's stance on environmental issues you attack the democrats. I, personally, ally myself down neither party-line, however I think the Republicans are going down an awful path. There are to many self-righteous people like you running that circus. This perhaps has become less obvious do to the extreme patriotism shown post-S11, but remember Bush's no compromise stance cost him the Senate, after a member of his party felt so alienated he went independent. Colin Powell himself, pre-S11, was being shut out because of his differing opinions.<br>
<br>
3. Do you think of yourself as a martyr here? You make many baseless inferences, and when we counter them you immediately play the &quot;I never said that, you said that&quot; game. <br>
Instead of implying someone, we won't name who, in this thread is looking for a free ride ,say it. Say Ritt wants a free ride and I'll completely blow that idea out of the water. <br>
<br>
4. Do you base anything you say off of anything that's been previously posted? You say how people know about this, but didn't care (reread the first page). You managed to reqoute a whole section of one of my posts, but failed to put the follow up statement that summed up its purpose. ( This is why environmental policies are crap)  You say that we are posting to amuse each other, when I have made strong attempts to post facts, I have checked into. <br>
<br>
5, As a lawyer do you work pro bono (sp?) ? How do you feel about those who get court appointed representation? Do they deserve as much out of their attorney as he who can pay? <br>
<br>
6. Do you posess the ability to obtain a fact? Your only counter to any stat is to call it propaganda, or to call us extremists. You ask for more information from us but fail to provide us with anything substantial. Whenever has a company been fined because their dirt isn't clean enough to eat? Or is that just your extremist propaganda to make those who point out the polluting done by the likes of Jack Welch to the Hudson seem less unsubstantial. <br>
<br>
Seriously, some of us are interested in the goings on of the country beyond mere party-line quibbles. If this is just a defend your party argument, great we understand your a diehard republican who can see no-wrong in them. Good for you. <br>

<br>
1.  I'm just responding to the posts.  You were the one who started the personal attacks and wrote the never ending paragraph of all of GW's faults according to you.  Hasn't been a debate since then.  If one arises though I'd be happy to play along.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2.  &quot;The number of superfund sites is expected to rise under Bushes lenient watch and penalties.&quot;  This is giving out the democrat and republican numbers?  You make such biased statements and expect not to be mocked?  I too, am an independant, so we have something in common....I have never voted for a democrat and likely never will, but I can still call myself and independant like you.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   How am I self righteous?   Don't really know what the point of the rest of the paragraph is but you are probably wrong about the reason Patrick Jeffers (or whatever his name is) left the Republican party.  He was promised positions if he switched and expected the Republicans to lose control when Strom Thurmond (again, spelling?) died or when the next elections occured.<br>
<br>
3.  No martyrs here.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   How do you counter my inferences?  What inferences have I made?  If you are refering to where you make up stuff and then I respond with I never said that...then what's your point?  You need to stop INFERING that I'm IMPLYING something.  Believe me, I am not being subtle about anything.  So lets get specific about the Superfund, do you want others to pay for superfund cleanups rather than yourself?  If the company responsible for the contamination cannot, for whatever reason, be held liable do you still want it cleaned up?  In that case, do you think that you should have to pay anything for it to be cleaned up?<br>
<br>
4.  I dispute your &quot;facts.&quot;  And yes, I do know about most of what you mentioned and don't care about the majority of it and neither do many other people.  You give one side of a story and then seem to think people should be out in the streets with pitchforks and torches.  Fact is, most people simply do not agree with you.  But that's ok, most people don't agree with me either.  People can have differing oppinions.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
5.  Sometimes, but not too much.  People who get court appointed representation are those people who have the state trying to take away some right of theirs, I feel their attorneys should get paid more to receive a more vigorous defense.  Depends on what you mean by deserving as much out of their attorney as he who can pay.  Do I think everyone deserves to have Johnny Cochran?  Nope.<br>
<br>
6.  What facts do you want?  &quot;Whenever has a company been fined because their dirt isn't clean enough to eat? &quot;  Whoever said they were?  Volume of the soil that can be ingested safely over time is one of the standards to determine if a site is &quot;clean.&quot;  The cleanup continues until the standards are met.<br>
Our basic philosophies are different.  You point at Jack Welch and use his actions as justifications for vilifying the rich and corporations.  I point at Jack Welch and use his actions as justifications for vilifying Jack Welch.  It is that simple.<br>
<br>
You think you have a monopoly on concern for the country?  What do you think you are accomplishing?  Flashing a list of things you disagree with GW on is how you show you aren't just a political hack?  There are quite a few things that I think the Republicans do wrong.  They just aren't the same things you think they do wrong.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In response to Arikel:<br>
<br>
You say &quot;We in turn are free to laugh at you and think that you are a tool. I'll disregard anything after this, since Ritt and I did trash you after this point. I'll also disregard absurd statements about the purpose of corporations (it's to make more money, you friggin' boob, not to provide jobs), since you are after all entitled to your opinion on the situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then I say &quot;And I'm gonna ignore you from now on because you obviously lost this argument and are stupid and you stink and are dumb and your mother dresses you funny and I'm going to tell the principal on you! Nyahhh-Nyahhh! (in case you dont' catch it, I'm again making fun of your childish attitude) &quot;<br>
<br>
The mockery is just lost on you isn't it?  Even with the caption telling you it is mockery you still just don't understand....maybe you need me to draw you a map so you can catch up?<br>
<br>
<br>
In response to Zariel:<br>
<br>
So teachers are not paid enough to support a household of two adults on their one salary?  If their spouse is unemployed then they can get some public assistance.  What's the problem with that?<br>
<br>
Now we're talking about households with two adults and one of them working, or possibly single parents of multiple children.  Sorry, Zariel, but I simply do not believe that teachers are underpaid just because they have difficulty supporting such families on their income alone.  I think that those are outrageous circumstances to use as your baseline.  Underpaid is relative to the work done.  What does it take to support a family of 2 adults or one adult and 0-3 children?  $30,000?  So is your position, then, that every job that does not pay $30,000 per year is underpaid?<br>
<br>
And I did not ask for a sob story from you.  You were the one who offered up the fact that you made $4,000 last year as some sort of proof that the poor work hard and need help.  Then turn around and say that you don't need help, but others do in similar situations.  If you worked 4 or 5 days a week for the entire school year (which is about 8 1/2 months out of the year after you subtract holidays, spring break, summer break and Christmas break) and only made $4,000 then I would definitely agree that you were underpaid, except for the fact that you did it.  So if someone is willing to do the job for that rate of pay, then obviously the pay is good enough to get the job done.  Although Andmunn is correct in pointing out that better pay would bring in better teachers and help retain the better teachers in a job where you want to have the best people available.<br>
<br>
I guess those people who were arguing about the shortage of teachers were mistaken.  Here is a teacher looking for full time work but cannot get it.<br>
<br>
And I'm not picking on anyone.  I'm just disagreeing with you on whether certain professions are underpaid.  I would especially disagree with you about nurses.  Here in Atlanta you can make $55k+ working 36 hours per week as a nurse.<br>

<br>
I teach for a pittance for two reasons.  The first is, most of the jobs around here are unskilled labor, and aren't interested in hiring someone with a BA.  I have to support us somehow, and I fill the qualifications this school district has for an in-classroom teacher.  The second reason is the more important reason.  I teach because I LOVE TO TEACH.  I love kids.  I love explaining things to them.  I love the look on their faces when they really "get" something.  I love the wild logical leaps their minds can make.  I like spending my day with people who have yet to be locked into a certain kind of behavior by societal conventions.  I think most teachers would not list pay as the reason they teach -- I think most, like me, would say they teach because they love it.<br>
You're sounding more reasonable now, at least in reference to me.  However, you seem to be under the assumption that I am looking for full-time teaching work.  That's not the case.  Why?  Because I do not consider myself qualified to teach full-time yet.  My BA is in Religion & Biblical Literature, not Education.  I have no formal training in education, just a knack for it.<br>
This coming fall, I will return to school to get my teaching certificate.  After that, it's off to graduate school for my Master of Education degree.  At that point, I will consider myself prepared for a full-time teaching position.  As things stand now, I can follow a lesson plan but I've never created one of my own.  I can explain something 50 ways until I'm sure each student in my care understands it, but I don't know which of those ways are the best.  I can teach a child to read or work a math problem, but I can't identify a learning difference.  There are many skills I need to aquire before I'd be a fit teacher.<br>

<br>
When you said &quot;Do I wish I worked more often? Yes, of course. Do I wish I could find full-time work in my area? Damn skippy, I do.&quot;  That led me to believe you were looking for full time teaching work.<br>
<br>
If you enjoy teaching, then good luck to you, I hope you get to do it.  But you are proof that people take the job knowing that they are only going to be making $20K to $23K (and probably a little more with a master's degree).  That is why I do not have sympathy for teachers regarding their pay.  They take the job knowing what it pays, and generally there is no shortage of people willing to do it.  <br>
<br>
And you are perfectly qualified to teach without a formal education in teaching.  My wife had to take all of those education classes getting her master's degree, they are a waste of time.  More of an indoctrination program than an educational program.  <br>
<br>
So you may wanna rethink the cost-benefit of another 3 or 4 years of school.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Cenelron Tank'n'Puller <BR>

Lesson planning and the like. My father was until recently a senior lecturer in education. I recall being kinda surprised when I started to realise just how much there was to what he was teaching. I've also heard a lot of teaching horror stories, from both parents (my mother is a school counselour), and why this knowledge is important. Seems like Zariel knows it too. Cenelron, is your wife a teacher or did she do the coursework and not actually work in the environment where it's implemented?<br>
<br>
As for teachers salaries, I think teachers are incredibly undervalued. In my opinion, education is possibly the most important element in our society. And a broad general education for all is even more valuable. No corporation gains obvious economic benefit from it - though most corporations would collapse if they could not employ literate staff. Thus the traditional economic rationalist view would probably lead to no public schooling, and completely unpaid teachers. Teachers provide THE most valuable service to our society and community, yet receive quite poor financial rewards, and often do not receive the recognition from other people that I believe they deserve. I have enourmous respect for those that choose to teach.<br>
<br>
I'm glad that you, Zariel, feel rewarded by the passing on of knowledge and sparks of childhood intelligence. I can see the attraction in it too, and have often considered trying to move into teaching myself. I think it may be much more personally rewarding than software development. <p>----------------------------------<br>

Herein lies a pretty serious problem... the only means teachers have to force higher pay and better benefits is to refuse to enter the profession in the first place, or to strike.  Now, if there are not enough software developers available to work (whether due to strikes or to a labor shortage), the worst that's going to happen is that The Return to the Return of Castle Wolfensam 4D isn't going to come out on time, or the next EQ expansion is going to suck (arguably a foregone conclusion).  If there are not enough teachers available, children's education suffers.  Their situation is not much different than the situation fire fighters and police are in, though without the immediate short-term consequences; is it really right to place your own economic wants/needs over those of people who _need_ you?  It's a fundemental failure of capitalism, and one that's not easy to solve.  It's not like pure communism actually works outside of small and limited environments.  I suspect the solution will involve elements of socialism, but it will most likely remain a basically capitalist system.<br>
<br>
And on top of all that, I still don't buy into the assertion that people should be punished for choosing a profession that they love.  Some people love to practice law, some love medicine, some love psychiatric counseling... they aren't punished financially for that.  Differences in educational requirements notwithstanding, why should it be any different for teachers?<br>

I get lots of solitude and can read a lot on the job.  Why should I be punished with low wages for doing a job I love?  I guess it is because if they offer $8 per hour for the job, someone qualified will take it and the job will get done.  It's all about finding someone qualified and getting them to do the job.  <br>
<br>
Not everyone has the capacity to be a doctor.  In order to get those few that can do it to go into the field, they are paid at a very high rate.  <br>

Few people love being a lawyer.  It is hard work and not nearly as glamorous as portrayed on LA Law.  If it did not have the potential to pay very well I would not be doing it.  It's all about finding someone qualified and getting them to do the job.  <br>
<br>
Teachers strike all the time.  Johnny is not going to be a derranged human being for the rest of his life if his teacher strikes for a year.  The problem is that someone else WILL do the job for that rate.  That is not a failure of capitalism.  That is a triumph.  The services are provided without unnecessary expenditures of tax dollars.  If the job has five people lining up to do it at $20k per year, why should they pay $30k per year?<br>

Socialism is BAAAAAD!<br>

If they are working a 40-hour week, why not make decent pay?  It's an interesting circle -- you hate welfare, yet the refusal to pay unskilled laborers more than $8 keeps them on welfare.  The gas station attendant job requires little skill, but if he were paid more, he could get off welfare.<br>
I know a LOT of lawyers, seeing as my father is one.  The majority of them LOVE their jobs.  I have a friend who got a summer job as essentially an errand-runner at a law firm.  The next summer, she was hired for paralegal-style work.  She majored in European History, and is currently working as a paralegal, saving money for law school.  Why?  Because she loves it.  No one _has_ to be a lawyer...if they hate it so much, they could always be a gas station attendant.  *shrug*  It bet it's less demanding.<br>
As for my education, it's like I said.  _I_ won't consider myself worthy of a position as a full-time teacher until I have that education.  I hate school; I want to make sure I can do what I set out to do.  I want to keep other children from hating school if I can.  Hopefully, the more I know, the better a job of that I can do!  As I said when debunking the class-envy argument, I have wealthy parents who also think I should have this schooling.  3 years is not much to sacrifice to do a good job at something I love.<br>
