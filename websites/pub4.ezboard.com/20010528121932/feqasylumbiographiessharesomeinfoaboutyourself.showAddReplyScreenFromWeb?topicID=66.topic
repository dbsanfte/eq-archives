<br>
<br>
Maids and servants scurried around, frantically trying to save what items they could. Headservants shouted orders over the rising chaos. Erudin had never needed an evacuation before.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
A heretic team outside wove intricate spells into the web, forming a linking chain of dark magic. Sacrifices, sometimes their own, were made in preparation for the siege. They unleashed the first of their barrages. The war had begun.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The building shook with incredible force as the first wave of dark magic collided with Erudin's conjured defensive shield. High Mages of Erudin watched as their barrier braced, buckled, and miraculously, held. Waves of shadows rose over the shield, blocking out the sun for moments. <br>
<br>
A shout of triumph rose up over Erudin.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&quot;Go on, Erushan, boy!&quot;, his father called, tending to the wounds of the men returning from the scouting party sent into the forest. Clerical magic ebbed as the sky darkened for a moment, and spellbound sutures and salves weakened and strained against the wounds they sought to control. <br>
<br>
Erushan looked back, with regret. He knew he had to leave. There was no other option.<br>
<br>
He set about his task obidiently. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
At the docks, Erushan saw the boat he was to take to Qeynos. Militia and Mages bearing the Qeynosite coat of arms disembarked from the boat and rushed towards the portals nearby. <br>
<br>
It all seemed like a fantastical story told to him by his <br>
father. Of fantastic armies assembled to further the cause of their dieties, of dragons, archmages and astounding magic. His thoughts drifted back into the days when, sitting upon his father's lap, he would listen with fascination... he smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;All's that's a-goin'aboard, get's aboard!&quot; he heard someone shout. <br>
<br>
The smile left him. This was no time for daydreaming. He rushed aboard the boat with his belongings, and quickly found a seat. Others followed suit and jostled around, looking vainly for seats to occupy.<br>
<br>
Through the mahogany and ironwood hull, he could hear a mage's incantation. He glanced outside of the porthole. The world seemed to slow. The haste spell had taken effect on the boat. <br>
<br>
Erushan could not resist his ebbing spirit. He had to see Erudin one more time. He stood up, gathered his packs, and went abovedeck. A teenage girl with infant in her hands sat down in his place, giving him her thanks. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
On the sundeck, Erushan breathed some fresh sea air and felt calmed. He put on his red silk-brimmed cap and looked at Erudin, in all it's splendour. It was magnificent. If only he had had the forthought to have looked back when his family took him vacationning to Qeynos. If only he could keep this image in his mind forever...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The haste spell sped the boat away from Erudin, within minutes, Erudin was out of view. A young erudite boy with a red hat went to a quiet, dark corner and cried until they arrived at Qeynos.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The arrangements were already made. Young Erudites would be placed in the care of foster homes until this battle was over. <br>
<br>
Erushan sped to his foster home, not even seeking a bind. He was among few lucky erudites who knew their guardians. And he knew them well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ho there, little one! Now where're ye off'ta, so quick and lightfeeted, hmm?&quot; a guard said, smiling. He gently tried to halt the young speeding Erudite.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave me be! I've things to attend to!&quot; replied Erushan. He mimicked the tone his mother used on intrusive servants.<br>
<br>
The guard watched him go, grinning. Erudites.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
&quot;Auntie Cass! Uncle Ian!&quot; squealed the young lad, he bounded into 'Uncle Ian', nearly toppling him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoa there littl'un! I could've taken such a mighty blow when I wore the clothes of a man half my age!&quot;<br>
<br>
Erushan drew back, wrinkled his nose, and charged him  again. <br>
<br>
The man toppled under the new attack and fell comically on his rear. Erushan screamed with delight and entered the house. <br>
<br>
Shaking his head to clear it the man turned to his wife, and asked, smiling: &quot;Why's it that we're able ta bring out the very BEST in erudites?&quot; <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Months passed in his new home, Erushan never hearing of his parents. In this small scribe's home, he read stories of far-off lands, magnificent creatures and powerful magics. His hunger for lore here was satiated. <br>
<br>
The day came, however, when his guardians came to the conclusion that it was not right to keep a lad like this bound to a house. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
My patience writing this story has run out, sadly.<br>
I meet up with Utadin, we go separate ways, he learns on his own, i take a mentor... etc etc etc<br>
