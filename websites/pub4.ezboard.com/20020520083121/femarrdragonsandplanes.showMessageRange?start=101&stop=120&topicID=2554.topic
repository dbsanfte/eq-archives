Take her out for a drink, it costs less.  And if you witness 'attitude' you can toss down a couple bucks and walk away, whereas dinner you have to wait for the check and continue hearing how rude you are.<br>
<br>
Never hope for sex.  If she's a tease, it's probably because she a horrible screw anyway.<br>
<br>
Never ask her about you're size, technique and such.  Who care's as long as you bust you're nut in or on her.  If you talk to her, ask her what feel's good to her.  If she can't decide what feel's good, then concentrate on yourself.<br>
<br>
Never worry about them faking it, just don't get a shared bank account.<br>
<br>
Never worry about being the best lover she's ever had, just worry about getting drunk and telling her that her sister was better.<br>
<br>
Never tell them they look fat in last year's dress.  Truth hurts<br>
<br>
Never tell them that you crashed the car looking at another girls ass, because the only ass you've seen in months has been her cottage cheese lookin one.<br>
<br>
Buy her flower's, chocolate's and such.  And have them delivered to her work, where her friends will see it.  When she screw's up and loses you, her friends will bang you thinking you're kind and considerate.  And it'll piss her off mightily when you do more for another woman than you did for her, and she has to hear about it everday.<br>

The truly 'dumb' person is the one who ends up alone 30 years down the road.<br>

Seems there were a few things I missed in this thread.<br>
<br>
Quote Ananiel,<br>
Thirdly As for trapping a man by getting pregnant..holy shit man..you have no bloody idea as to what your talking about...you think being pregnant is a cake walk...shove a ten pound bowling ball up your ass carry it around for 9 months...and then pass it again...thats how fun it is.<br>
<br>
Ok. I can see your veiw,BUT, You go through that for 9 months. Why ?<br>
Unless your Married and Planned the Kid, Why the FUCK have it !<br>
<br>
And further more,, You go through all that pain dont ya ? Well,,,<br>
<br>
Try Busting your GODAMN ASS FOR EIGHTEEEN FUCKING YEARS<br>
paying for that FUCKING KID  !! Your 9 months means nothing <br>
compared to Fucking up a mans Life cause you were A Horney Slut<br>
Wanting a GDAMN Kid.. Hello abortion.. Hello Rubbers..<br>
<br>
Hello Birth Control. OH you forgot to take it for FIVE GODAMN DAYS.<br>
You fucking SLUT !!! Now someone has to PAY ! Cause you wanted<br>
a Real GODAMN DOLL TO PLAY WITH !! Fucking Sluts..<br>
<br>
Preach your Bowling ball Bitch.. Cry a Godamn River... OH you had<br>
to Have that baby did you ? Who's choice was that ? Yea. so Fuck you !<br>
<br>
Abortion is LEGAL !! Its not killing ! Its fucking legal.. Deal with it..<br>
<br>
<br>
Next,,Ananiel,,<br>
and hey...give me a bloody break if you think all women do this on purpose.. <br>
<br>
Yes they do..<br>
And I can tell you why, For 1/2 the dumb Bitches.<br>
They do it on Purpose cause at 14-18 Knowing they can get ALIMONY<br>
for EIGHTEEN FUCKING YEARS at 200-300 a month is alot of money !<br>
<br>
Yea. Dumb bitches think thats a ton of Bucks at that age. Not knowing<br>
that when they are 30+ they are nothing but a Used old RAG.<br>
<br>
One drink whores looking for a new Daddy !! +30 .. Just like YOU..<br>
<br>
<br>
Next,,<br>
As for the bitch part, you bet your ass I can be a bitch. You make kids out to be possessions, things, trinkets to be toyed with, well , they are not, they are not possessions as you seem to think they are, they are children. They are small helpless human beings that need to be nurtured and loved..<br>
<br>
No ! No No NO NO NO.. Women make kids toys in relationships.<br>
Women make KIDS Trinkets to hold in front of the men &quot;They want<br>
to Fuck money out of&quot; for EIGHTEEN GODAMN YEARS !!!<br>
<br>
Right. Children are Helpless. so why have them unless your Sex partner<br>
wants to have that child also ???? ABORTION is CHEAP ! And LEGAL..<br>
<br>
<br>
Next,,<br>
Get a vasectomy if you dont want to be strapped into having a child or burdened with their well being. And if you have a child, god , I am saying a prayer for them now on your callous attitude towards parenthood.<br>
<br>
Now, Since when is it the mans problem ? who was the Flirting,Busty<br>
babe laying down saying &quot;Put your Penis HERE &gt;&gt;! <br>
<br>
Its just as much a womans problem as the mans. The responsibility<br>
is on both sides. that is true.. But the Ultimate decision is the <br>
Dumb ass bitch that &quot;OOPS&quot; forgot to take the fucking PILLS, Or<br>
forgot to Make sure the man used a Condom. <br>
<br>
And its the Woman that decides to have the KID !! <br>
Don;t Dare blame a man for a Woman having a Kid cause it was the<br>
RIGHT THING TO DO !. Thats BS..<br>
<br>
MEN,, <br>
Read up.. Learn. Your young. Learn the way a Woman thinks. <br>
They can own you for EIGHTEEN FUCKING YEARS..<br>
<br>
Use a Condom.. Use TWO Condoms ! Don't buy into that &quot;I wana feel you&quot; Crap.. They wana get Pregnant !<br>
<br>
Tobasco is Awesome in spent condoms !<br>
<br>
It's late. I need sleep. Read up guys.. Learn..<br>

<br>
abortion -- there are several reasons why women do not want to have abortions.  well some people actually have morals and think it is wrong for one.  some people are really religious or come from really religious families and do not believe it is right.  you also can't control a person's views who have been conditioned to believe in their religion, some of those people are so fucking brainwashed nothing will get through to them that opposes their religion.  another major reason is guilt.  i don't think you understand what that must feel like to know that you have killed a growing being inside your body, a being that is a part of you.  you may not think about it the day you get the abortion, but that shit will be with you and on your mind the rest of your life.  not to mention abortions are physically and emotionally painful due to the procedure and chemicals and hormones involved.  women are emotional cus of hormones, not choices or stupidity.  also you have to take into consideration the disgusting number of girls out there who use abortion as a method of birth control.  in terms of my own views, if i got pregnant at this point in my life, i wouldn't think twice about NOT getting an abortion.  i have no desire to have children until i've established my career and am married and at least 30.  abortions wouldn't be a big deal to me.<br>
<br>
birth control -- hi, your penis is probably the most involved aspect in sex.  most the girls you're referring to who you seem to sleep with aren't there to get off with you, they're there to feel loved and attractive and to fulfill the empty void that another one of you bastards left her with.  most women don't get off from the old in out from a motherfucker like you who couldn't give two shits about reaching down and touching her source of pleasure called the clitoris or reaching inside and looking for that g-spot.  they're there cus they want attention or affection.  don't fool yourself into thinking you're a stud.  back to the point, you're probably the one who cares most about putting your dick inside the girl, therefore, you're equally responsible for birth control.  the girl would probably be satisfied just fooling around or cuddling, she could care less if you enter her, most do it out of obligation and to satisfy the guy.  putting on a condom is not that hard.  personally i don't like condoms and they irritate me, but i also don't like children, they irritate me too, so i choose the condom.  you suggest birth control pills, well you're only digging yourself into a bigger hole.  birth controls alter a woman's hormones.  they not only make the woman gain weight (which i'm sure would disgust you), but they intensify her emotions which only leads to more problems with you.  most other forms of birth control aren't even worth mentioning cus they aren't very effective on their own.  i mainly use birth control in order to prevent getting diseases from you nasty motherfuckers who stick your dick in everything that walks and will lie about it, i trust none of you.  you know how many of the guys i slept with i supposedly took their virginity from?  yah like i buy that one.  but i don't have to worry about that with my bf and that's the way it should be.<br>
<br>
financial support -- what decade are you living in?  last i checked most women out there were working now-a-days.  unless you live in some hick town which still prescribes to the theory that women should stay home and take care of the babies.  actually most of the colleges out there have a larger female population than male.  women can support themselves, you might be dating the skanks who don't want to do this, but that doesn't mean all women are like that, it just means that you have no taste in women.  i personally have always intended to support myself.  i've never even thought about having my husband or boyfriend support me, it never even occurred to me as an option.<br>
<br>
and god forbid if i ever got pregnant from an asshole like you and wanted to keep the kid (no way in hell), i sure as hell wouldn't expect anything out of you.  and i'm not saying cus i don't want to punish you for being an asshole, cus trust me, having your child seems to be a great revenge for you, but i wouldn't want to expose my child to such ignorance.  not to mention that i wouldn't want your fucking money.<br>

and this whole tobassco sauce thing must be a joke.  i don't know one woman that would crawl through the garbage after sex to find some nasty condom that has your filthy sperm in it and insert it into her already tainted from you body.  that would make me vomit seriously.  and if you hear her screaming in the bathroom after sex, it's probably cus she's trying to finish the job you couldn't even start without your pathetic cock. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=patric>patric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 975<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/3/01 6:31:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2554.topic&index=108>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Men who like sex</span><hr size=1> Zolmaz you crack me up, that tobasco thing is great! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=patric>patric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 976<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/3/01 6:32:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2554.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Men who like sex</span><hr size=1> and before anyone pops a blood vessel screaming at me (meagan).....i dont think of women like Zolmaz does, not all of em anyway.
