I believe that either 1) You are lying and trying to get another 15k out of me or 2)  Someone loged on your account while you were offline, because I paid you (read: the character Seolblade) quite a few weeks ago.  After I paid you you loged on a few days later and asked me to pay you yet again.  Immediatly this sturck me as odd and I put you on ignore because I thought you were trying to scam me.  If it really wasn't you I paid then i think you should talk to whoever has your account info instead of trying to get another 15k out of me since I am not responsable for whoever logs you on.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you ARE trying to squeeze an extra 15k out of me then you may fuck off and die, I have been scamed before and I detest people who steal from others.  <br>

Jeez, yeah, they say that, occasionally.  <br>
<br>
Honestly, do you trust your friends, your guildmates?  Do you know where each of them live?  You don't, and don't lie about it, either.<br>
<br>
I frequently trade spells/plat with a member of a large guild.  Sometimes the spell is on a mule, when I give the money to a different character.  I trust this person to log in the mule and give me the spell.  He's always done it.  <br>
<br>
Why?  Because he's honest.  But besides that, if I bitched to his guild, I guarantee they would make it right.  I might be a mouthy bitch, but I don't lie.  Do I trust him? Sure, I do.  But even if I didn't, I trust the guild.  But then, I'm well known enough that if I bitched about it, someone would know I wasn't blowing smoke out my ass.<br>
<br>
Even if I got screwed, it's PIXELS ON A SCREEN.  <br>
