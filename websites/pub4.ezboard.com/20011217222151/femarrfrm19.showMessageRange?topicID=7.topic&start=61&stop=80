do you know anything about daoc .. and if you do how do you know the info , because you have stated many times on this board that you would never play a PVP game , where you had to pvp. Since alot of the game  at higher level is PVP did you start playing this game thus becoming a hypocrite or are you just talking out of the side of your mouth .. <br>
<br>
if you are not playing the game it seems the only reason you are posting is to continue this childish i must beat the mighty empire of dakor game you try to win.. <br>

MalQanar said :<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, but in order for freeport to be destroyed you first need the 3-d models/textures/other things of the rubble/ruined buildings that'd be left behind. That's why there is a level of hardware/graphic engine that would need to be attained in order to have that dynamic.. EQ can't do it without making you download the whole freeport zone, along with ecommons and nro as well (if they show freeport in the background, can't remember)&quot;<br>
<br>
 I would think that the 3d models or ruins etc would be more software that would be included in the game. In the burning forest in Kunark you see smoke billowing from burning trees, etc. Those trees were included on the CD. Now for the sake of discussion, could there have been files included in your original EQ software that showed Freeport as a smoldering pile of rubble? I think it could have been, but it is not becasue there was no need for it.<br>

2)  Hibernia has kickass archers.  Many, many Hibernian players agree that archers were broken, in fact many of us consider them borderline broken as they are now.  <br>
<br>
3)  Referring to Vendrix as Varixx sure makes you sound old school, Chiteng.  I wasn't going to listen to a word you said, but now that I know that you knew Vendrix as Varixx I totally respect your opinion.  Wait, check that.... no, I don't.

I call him Varixx because he IS Varixx. I dont really care what YOU call him<br>

<br>
Arikel?,<br>
<br>
I AM old school chum. From a time long ago when monks kicked ass and<br>
warriors could only envy us.<br>
<br>
So Sanya is a developer. So what? Are you saying that Varixx would NOT use<br>
an internal relationship to win a fight if he had to? If that is what you are saying<br>
I suggest you dont know him as well as you think you do. It is EXACTKLY this<br>
aspect of the game that I have the MOST reservations about.<br>
<br>
Celdor,<br>

Man you are the absolute best audience I ever had. Ok<br>
I DID start a kobold hunter on Merlin. Sure ONCE HE HAD A BOW<br>
he kicked some ass. Getting there, not so much fun. His solo ability<br>
not great. Ability to say solo a Giant...not good. Usefullness in a dungeon<br>
questionable. Ability to carry arrows heh what a joke.<br>
If ANY class gets next to you your DEAD. That plus you need to take up <br>
fletching and spend a minimum of two solid days getting your skill up<br>

Sorry, can’t take credit for this one. The fix was already in the works before I sent my short email the next day asking them to analyze that specific aspect of Archers:<br>

<I><b>Actually, I watched a battle this weekend where that was a problem. Maybe it was yours =)It struck me as total cheese, but our fault, not the players'.

This is the second time I’ve had to defend my position as a beta tester, the other time was from Mitch – what a total shocker. Thinking back, the only change that was made to Midgard per our(guild mates and myself) emails was a little less rain and an hour or two more daylight. I guess that could still make me evil though. I didn’t give a second of thought to the fragile ecosystem of Midgard and all the poor, innocent creatures that relied on those daily tsunamis for life… <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

No one denies that the archer system extant was flawed.<br>
It is your exploitation of the flaw to promote yourself that grates.<br>
I am certain that other people (cronies of yourself) have found additional<br>
'flaws' but we dont hear about it because the DONT promote themselves <br>
in such a self-serving manner.<br>
<br>
You should realize that doing so betrays your own fears.<br>
<br>
I have absolutely no doubt whatever that is faced with a technical conflict<br>
that you feared you might lose you would bring to bear any and all relationships<br>
that 'you' feel you have with the developers. <br>
<br>
What you dont realize (or possibly care about) is that they KNOW what you are doing. You will just have to trust me on that.<br>

It seems to me that YOU cant let is go.<br>
That then is YOUR problem.<br>
<br>
My beef with DK is over. <br>
If you can read then you should know that.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are serious in what you both have said to me in private,<br>
are you not doing exactly what you claim I was doing?<br>
Projecting your opinion as to motives as fact?<br>

Chiteng, you're an idiot.  Really.  I want you to go back and read that lime colored text again.  Then think about that for a minute.</p><br>
<p>  Guess what Chiteng, the reason for beta testing is to find flaws in the game and correct them.  If you never report the problems what is the point of having a beta test?  Vendrix made a keen observation about the archers, and reported it.  They didn't have to change it, but they did.  You know what that means? It means he was <font color="red">RIGHT</font> the archers WERE/are over powered.</p><br>
<p>  So Vendrix is developing a relationship with the game developers.  So what, are you Jealous?  Vendrix is the EXACTLY kind of person I would want to have beta testing my game.  Vendrix is a dedicated gamer, and he wants to see the game improve.  He has no trouble stating his opinion clearly and precisely, and getting his point across.</p><br>
<p>Honestly, quit posting here, no one wants to hear your shit anymore.  NO ONE enjoys your posts(althought I do get a nice read every time Vendrix and Kerrol decide to come stomp you into the dust like they do EVERY fucking time).  You might say people enjoy them, but we all know no one really does.  Somone told you IG that they liked your post?  Does acid tripping ring a bell?  Lay off the shrooms, they are bad for you.<br>

I thought it was about opinions of the lifespan of DAoC?<br>
<br>
&lt;-----goes back to read over to see if he missed something.<br>
<br>
ok re-read...and im lost.<br>
<br>
Chiteng, can you PLEASE start a bashing thread on another post?..everything here was based on DAoC and the opinions of the game, its future, its makings, etc..until you and hawaii decided to try and edumacate us with slander and people bashing. Hawaii is now gone *HINT**HINT*.<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
As for the hardware / software battle, the only place hardware needs to be upgraded is the internet connections. Desktop computers are fast enough to handle the software you speak of as far as changing worlds(look at some of the incredible graphics coming from single player games). The internet connection is the slow part&lt;insert technical jargon here&gt;, but by 2005 that should all change *wink*.<br>
<br>
As for Vendrix, if he really does &lt;looks up for black helicopters&gt; have ties with sanya..then PLEASE PLEASE fix the pure rogue classes.<br>
<br>
That is all, k thanks buh bye. <br>

No motherfucking one denies that the fucking archer system extant was flawed.<br>
That shit is your sorry exploitation of the fucking flaw to promote yourself that grates. Mind if I wallop your ass? I am certain that other people (cronies of yourself) have found additional<br>

Chiteng, you and your hemorrhoids're a motherfucking idiot.  Really. RARRRRRRRRR! I want you and your hand-job to go back and read that lime colored text again.  Then think about that for a motherfucking minute.<br>

Guess fuckin' what Chiteng, the fucking reason for beta testing is to fuckin' find flaws in the fucking game and correct them piece of shits. Caw caw! The ravens are singing, I should neglect your neck. If you never report the fucking problems fuckin' what is the fucking point of having a motherfucking beta test? Shut your mouth when I'm asking for answers. Are you ready to burn? Vendrix made a motherfucking keen observation about the fucking archers, and reported that bastard. Wanna burn? Them lumberjacks didn't have to change that piece of shit, but them shitheads did.  You know fuckin' what that means? Fuckin' you should know. That piece of shit means he was RIGHT the fucking archers WERE/are over powered.<br>

No. I will do whatever I want. You have zero impact.<br>
If my posts offend you dont read them.<br>
It is a very simple concept to grasp.<br>
If there is no information and no validity in what I post,<br>
what are you a masochist that you just have to read them?<br>
<br>
As for the Beta testers finding flaws. Indeed they ARE supposed to do that.<br>
However I do not see them all telling us how great they are because they found<br>
&lt;whatever&gt;<br>
<br>
Personally I dislike the way you fall thru the most innocuos features and have to<br>
walk back to wherever you were.<br>
<br>
Arikel: I am very glad you understand that(what you said in your post.)<br>
<br>
As for Varixx and whatever he thinks he is doing. He chose to pick this particular<br>
fight. Ok get on HIS case. He could have said &quot;Chiteng you flammed the wrong<br>
person&quot; THAT would have embarassed me. That is not what he chose to do.<br>
<br>
As for the issue of making freinds with the game designers. I want to thank you<br>
all. I just mailed a couple of them that 'I' know, this thread. Along with some comments.<br>
Nothing will diffuse the potencial more than dragging them into an argument.<br>
Especially on a topic that doesnt matter at all.<br>
Influence is like Intrest. The more you use it, the less you have.<br>

This is fucking retarded. You start a thread with absolutely nothing to do with Da`kor or whatever and he takes it over halfway through and it turns into a flaming pile of doo. Hard to even come to the board anymore as this asshole constantly makes every thread another showplace for his da'kor hatred. Hell, I never got along with Da`kor that well but LET IT FUCKING GO MAN. We all know your positions, and nobody gives a fuck. I am seriously begging you Ogmuk, ban Chiteng before it becomes impossible to start any relatively interesting thread without his wonky ass screwing it up. Thanks.<br>
