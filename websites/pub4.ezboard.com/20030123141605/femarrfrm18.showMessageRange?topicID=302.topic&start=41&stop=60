<br>
I think a represenative's responsibility should be to represent the whole community that he/she is responsible for.  It is similar to a household with 3 kids (2 girls and 1 boy).  If you ask the kids to vote on what they want to do for fun, the boy may never get a chance to do something he likes since he is in the minority.  So parents will try to make sure his wishes are represented in some form (e.g. taking turns deciding).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your not ramming atheism down my throat by not praying before a meeting any more then a Christian does by praying before a meeting.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It is hard to justify a nonaction as ramming something down someone's throat.  But I do know what you mean.  Some nonactions can create awkward social situations (like not saying &quot;excuse me&quot; after belching).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There has to be 'morals' in law. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is where I have to disagree.  The problem is determining what are correct morals.  Some Christians do not believe that women should wear jeans.  Afghanistan is a country that placed a lot of 'morals' into its laws.  I think we have seen how destructive that can be in the long run.<br>
<br>
Laws should be based on 'rights.'  Rape violates another person's rights.  So does murder and theft.  There is no need to appeal to morality to justify such laws.  What does become a sticky issue are laws designed to ensure the country's prosperity.  These are stuff like seat belt laws, establishing national laboratories and maintaining a military.  However, these types of laws can be easily be changed to morality laws when people are not watching.  States use these types of laws to determine who can marry, which should be a morality issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, at the same time I do not want my children to have to leave their religion and beliefs at the door. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't think anyone is trying to stop people from having a religion.  Like one of the prayer in school cases that went to the supreme court was based on a change of wording in the law.  The law use to say that there could be a quiet time for meditation.  They changed it to be a quiet time for meditation or religion.  The judges felt that there was already time for students to pray with the original wording.  The additional wording showed that the school was starting to push students to pray.<br>

There are two very familiar signs we see today...one is No Smoking and the other is No Concealed Weapons... What’s next, an R in a circle with a slash through it?"</i><br>
<br>
There is a difference between "wearing a religion" and being religious. Those who wear religion do so as a badge and flaunt it. Those who are religious need not prove to others their faith. They are content with being meek, showing humility rather than the pride those who tend to wear religion display.<br>
<br>
<i>"In America, we elect our representatives based upon how well we think they will represent us. If we are conservative Christian, then we vote for thus...Likewise if one is liberal atheist..."</i><br>
<br>
I am not so sure I follow the "conservative/liberal" dichotomy you present. In general, atheists tend not to follow any religion so can't be considered "religious liberals". Atheists can be politcally conservative as well as liberal. Christians can also vary in political alignment, too.<br>
<br>
However, I do follow your point on electing officials, but I wonder why one would want to elect an official on the basis of religious affiliation? After all, just because one is a professed Christian doesn't negate that the individual is actually a child molester, rapist, murderer, etc. I think you get the point.<br>
<br>
I also fully agree with Quath on this point. The best politicians are those who can represent all their constituents... even the atheist. After all, we atheists don't drink blood, or sacrafice babies. We tend to be very moral (more so than many professed Christians) and strongly promote liberty for all. Personally, I found but a couple Christians who promote liberty for all. Most Christians, in my experience, want to see government legislate from the morals of the Bible (of course, those they pick and choose from) and not from common sense, as Thomas Paine put it. <br>
<br>
<i>"There has to be 'morals' in law. There are many 'moral' laws that we can all agree with already that no one would want to change. Can anyone think of a few? These are more then "common sense" laws..Why is murder and stealing a crime?"</i><br>
<br>
Can you please explain why these are more than common sense laws? From my perspective we are all born without a religious faith, but with natures such that we are virtuous. After all, murder was frowned upon long before Judaism and Christianity were born. Somehow, people managed to live by laws for thousands of years without Judeo-Christian ethics. :)<br>
<br>
<i>"As far as prayer over the schools PA system, I am not for it. The reason is that I do not want my children to be 'pressured' into praying to a god that I do not approve of."</i><br>
<br>
Yes we agree. :) So, what is the difference then between that and a Senator praying into a microphone before a captive audience? I don't want my fellow countrymen and countrywomen pressured into praying to a god not of their choice. Again, such prayers are not protected by the Constitution. They are an abuse of power.<br>
<br>
<i>"There is alot of crap we do not want our children to watch and see. How do we fix it? We turn off the TV."</i><br>
<br>
Public prayers by elected officials (or paid public officials) before those who are not of a like minded faith is an abuse of power not protected by the constitution. Fellow senators can't just "change the channel" if one of their colleagues step up to the microphone and begin to pray to their God.<br>
<br>
I recall debating a Baptist minister over this very issue. He remarked that atheists, such as myself, should be grown up enough to accept the prayer and move on. I then asked him if he thought Jehovah's Witnesses were Christians. He said no. I then asked if he minded being forced to hear them pray to Jehovah. He was visibly flustered proclaiming that such a prayer is bothersome because it is to a false god. I asked this Baptist minister if he was narrow minded for believing that when Christians pray in public, then automatically all other faiths become illegitimate. Needless to say, he was not happy with logical reasoning on that score.<br>
<br>
The score is that those of a like minded faith will tolerate the public prayers of those supporting their own faith. God forbid that any other type of prayer be presented! It is with foresight that our founding fathers saw fit to seperate Church from the day to day affairs of running the government. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 741<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/30/02 2:58:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Rheaton</span><hr size=1> I just wanted to post this reminder that I am not trying to prove you (or anybody <i><b>wrong</i></b>) and I don't feel that you are doing that, too.

<br>
Mah personal feelings in wraps are thus.. <br>
<br>
I have no doubt that there are forces or powers that be that are wanting and motivated to move our society away from any moral and or Christian 'value'. Not so much because its by some considered 'politically incorrect', but cause its not 'their bag'. There is a large and politically involved group of peeps in this nation that desire carnal freedom whom wish to remove and un-tie any and all past constraints that 'bind the flesh'.<br>
<br>
Again..these are my personal feelings in regards to many of the 'social issues' or moral arguments we find ourselves engaged in nowadays..<br>
<br>
I try very hard to remain open-minded to these arguments...to see 'both sides of the coin'. However, much of the time my personal convictions drive my attitude, disallowing me to form what some may consider an un-bias point of view....Im ok with that lol...  It is indeed a passion that we have in us.<br>
<br>
When talking about constitutional rights, and esp. freedom of religion, I try very hard not to use that as a crutch of sorts.. But I feel very passionate that it was / is indeed the moral 'fabric' of the constitution that has gotten this country where it is today. The founders of this nation were never seeking freedom from God. The freedom that they sought was that of which they felt was entitled to them by and from God...this is the moral fabric of which I speak of.<br>
<br>
NEway, no offense taken in any way. I do enjoy coming here to this message board and participating in open-minded discussions with you gentlemen.<br>

<br>
While I don't think we NEED public prayers I do feel the need to point out that Jesus never spoke against them.  In fact, as I recall he spoke against <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> pronouncing your beliefs to others.  Also somewhere in this thread someone asked what constituted an &quot;acceptable religion,&quot; and I believe I can answer that question.  An &quot;acceptable religion&quot; is one that does not advocate infringing on someone elses rights.  Even the constitution had this loop-hole. Freedom to excercise your rights without infringing on others.

&gt; I have no doubt that there are forces or powers that be that are wanting and<br>

<br>
Thought provoking. Amongst my thoughts are fear, and surprise, and ruthless efficiency...and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope.... err.. sorry wrong thought train.. Amongst my thoughts are:<br>
* the question of what is meant by society in this context. The society in which I move is not particularly Christian at all. I'm motivated to prevent Christian beliefs being forced apon it. (clarification here: I'm not rejecting most Christian morals here, but I don't want all of them, nor the capital B Belief backing them)<br>
* not only my section of society. I don't want to see one section of society (even though it may be the majority) impose it's views apon another.<br>
* then there's the question of exactly which brand of Christian values should be those of &quot;our society&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt; I try very hard to remain open-minded to these arguments<br>
<br>
Just wanted to applaud your open-mindedness in these debates. I think it's a great virtue, and hopefully I'm not behaving too narrow-mindedly here either. It's wonderful too be able to have a rational debate. I really gotta stay away from Chiteng and the R&amp;F board.<br>

&gt; refusing to allow people to pray in public<br>
and Rheaton again<br>
&gt; One is not promised the right to not hear what they wish not to hear.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't want to ban praying in public. To me it's a matter of how one goes about it, and in particular, how the public is expected to interact with the prayer. The (mythical) baby eating Satanist should not be allowed to  practice &quot;religious&quot; rites in public (or private for that matter). I hope you would agree that a muslim should be allowed to kneel down and pray to Mecca in public, but it would not be appropriate to do it on a busy stairwell, nor to require everyone else on the train station to join in.<br>
<br>
Again, I think the matter has to be dealt with with considerable tact by public figures. If an elected representative of the people wishes to pray for guidance, that is ok. On the other hand I don't want to see prayers starting with &quot;We, the people of America..&quot; (or Australia as the case may be). I think what I'm saying is that I draw a distinction between public prayers, and prayers in public, and that the line comes into play when you are dealing with an official figure. This could also be a school principal.<br>
<br>
&gt; Here is a profound thought and I challenge anyone and everyone to prove<br>
&gt; me wrong... : The only rights WE have as a nation and people are those<br>
&gt; rights which are NATURALLY given us by GOD.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, your premise relies on the existance of God, and not believing in Him, I can't easily address it. I suspect however, that we may find that we would agree on what many of those rights are, whether they are granted us by God or not. <p>----------------------------------<br>

I agree with you Aphroditex. However, that is not the issue. The issue is over public officials (including elected officials) who pray in public over "captured audiences". That is a form of intimidation, and is an abuse of power. Both of which are not protected by the constitution as free speech. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 761<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/31/02 10:41:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=52>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> <i>"The only rights WE have as a nation and people are those rights which are NATURALLY given us by GOD."</i><br>
<br>
Rheaton, I have to disagree. First, for your conclusion to go through you MUST prove the existence of your god. That would be a rather difficult task, to say the least. However, even if we grant you that there is yet another problem.<br>
<br>
You are saying what <i><b>ought</b></i> to be drawn from statements you think <i><b>is</b></i> the case. However, the best that the theist can do is speculate on what is the case. Drawing conclusions of what <i>ought</i> to be done from such is folly.<br>
<br>
In order to claim that your god gives us rights you will not be able to work backwards from moral statements we humans used long before there ever was the Christian statement of God. "You ought not murder" is common sense, not divine mandate.  <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/1/02 6:43:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> In regards to the scripture, Matthew 6:5-6, we need to ask a couple of questions.<br>
   Does praying openly make one a hypocrite or is being vain in one's prayers make them hyps.? I personally do not think that Jesus was saying &quot;if you pray in public, you are a hypocrite&quot;. I read that as to mean that there were those who would flaunt their religion in the faces of man and that they would stand before men to try and prove they where holy by praying loudly and out-loud. By praying FOR men to see their prayers were in vain and fruitless.<br>
  The same for those who would fast.... They would 'disfigure their faces' to let everyone know they were fasting.. What Jesus was talking against, IMO, was the vanity of men of religious tradition. &quot;When in Rome, do as the Romans do&quot; does not work when communicating with the Father.<br>
   There are numerous scriptures that speak of collective prayers and openly praying.<br>
<br>
Men ought to be free or men ought to be govern by men is the question. Your a necro, you conjure up the founding fathers and ask them heheh. They believed that God created men to be free and that He intended for mankind to be free....and not oppressed or enslaved by other men. The same applies to their thinking in regards to religion in that men are not to be captive to the religions of men, but free to worship.<br>
<br>
Without the belief that freedom was God's intention, freedom would merely be speculation and 'want to'. Common sense does not give us any rights to freedom making civil rights only a wish.<br>
<br>
The entire foundation of freedom does not stem from wanting to be free, but that we are suppose to be free. And that God created mankind to be free. If you disprove God's existence, then you disproved our rights to freedom ...cause... without a mandate of God's intentions of freedom, one can only wish to be free and has no rights to be free.<br>

<br>
<i>"Does praying openly make one a hypocrite or is being vain in one's prayers make them hyps.? I personally do not think that Jesus was saying "if you pray in public, you are a hypocrite".</i><br>
<br>
I think Jesus was saying it is better to pray in your "room, close the door". God can see "what is done in secret". So, while praying openly doesn't make one a hypocrite, Jesus warns his followers to be seperate from the hypocrites who pray openly by praying in a private place. In short, I see Jesus saying it is better to not put prayers on display.<br>
<br>
<i>"Your a necro, you conjure up the founding fathers and ask them heheh."</i><br>
<br>
ROFL, BTW I did already. ;)<br>
<br>
<i>"Without the belief that freedom was God's intention, freedom would merely be speculation and 'want to'. Common sense does not give us any rights to freedom making civil rights only a wish."</i><br>
<br>
I don't see that as truth. Our basic nature guarantees to us certain rights such as liberty. Where one percieves a "law giver" granting rights another sees the same law giver taking them away. Freedom is a natural state not contingent upon the laws of one or many. We are all born free (don't sing the song!) with no intention involved. Common sense tells us that such liberty is taken away. Common sense tells us that all should return to freedom. As Thomas Paine put it, "Government even in its best state is a necessary evil". Our rights are not granted by God or government but are a part of who we are as beings.<br>
<br>
<i>"The entire foundation of freedom does not stem from wanting to be free, but that we are suppose to be free. And that God created mankind to be free."</i><br>
<br>
Aside from the god part, I get the gist of what you are saying and agree. Again, we are born in a natural state of liberty. Our freedom is not granted to us by any power at all. The struggle is a return to nature. Freedom is part of who we are as individuals. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/1/02 12:26:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> I find this very interesting!

I am interested in your thoughts in regards to freedom and all living creatures. For example: Cows and chickens being 'enslaved' to serve us as food. Many Christians justify this by quoting the bible in saying that God gave humans dominion over all creatures. How does a 'natural state of liberty' apply to creatures other then humans in your mind?<br>

<br>
In my view we are <i>all</i> animals preying upon each other. This all goes to the root of our basic biological functions and natural selection. We humans just happen to be the most successfull species for the time being. Putting the issue crudely into perspective... we are top dog and can eat whatsoever we choose. I have found that we usually feel discomfort eating species we use for pets, or we believe have a certain degree of intelligence. However, again, this is all part of our basic animalistic nature. That nature, viewed in and of itself, is amoral. It is that very nature that has guaranteed our success as a species.<br>

<br>
But in the excerpt it stated very clearly that the audience wasn't captive, it stated that many of the senators got up and walked out.  The priest chose to pray in public, the senators that didn't want to hear it chose to leave.  No one locked them in the room and chained them to their seats to force them to listen.<br>
<br>
As for the scripture that you quoted, Jesus does not say that praying in public is wrong, he simply says that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the reasons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for which some people pray in public are not the reasons for which you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be praying.  You should be praying for forgiveness and a bond with God, not for the admiration/acceptance of men.  As with all his teachings, Jesus provided the people with a way to be secure in knowing you are praying for the right reasons when he suggested that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  He was not saying that praying in public is wrong, he was simply saying that you would be secure in knowing (as God knows) that when you pray in private, you are doing it for the right reasons.  This was more a lesson to teach praying for the correct reason than a lesson denouncing prayer in public. <p>________________________________________________________<BR><a href><font color=#CC90FF><i><b>"I am a Child of the Universe.

<br>
I agree. However, Jesus directed that when you pray "go into your room". Not my room, not our room, not outdoors in the town square... no, in <b><i>your</i></b> room. He is obviously saying that it is better to pray in private than to pray in public. Why? <i>Because</i> public prayers tend to become nothing more than puppeteering to the audience. Remember, Jesus said "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners <b><i>to be seen by men</b></i>" Jesus is telling his followers not to pray in public for purposes other than conducting the business of their ministry. So, yes, Jesus speaks out against public prayers under certain conditions and tells his followers it is better to pray in private. It doesn't get much clearer than that.<br>
<br>
<i>"But in the excerpt it stated very clearly that the audience wasn't captive, it stated that many of the senators got up and walked out."</i> <br>
<br>
A "captive audience" is not one locked in a room, or chained to walls. A "captive audience" is one that assembles for some sort of business only to have it disrupted due to no choice of their own. Usually, the disruption is provided by a speaker who makes a presentation that was neither requested or planned.<br>
<br>
Besides, why the he<i></i>ll should I be put into a postion to have to leave a public gathering because some joker is abusing his power and authority? I take it, then, you would be all for a school principle chanting a Buddhist mantra over the PA system? Or, presenting a Baptist prayer over a PA system? The students could all get up and walk out, right?<br>
<br>
Or do you understand what it means for people of authority (especially public officials) to use their position of power and push their religious point of view onto those underneath them? That sort of coercion is flagrantly wrong. Yes, it is coercion. It is applying pressure upon those under you to bow their heads in prayer when in fact they don't want to.<br>
<br>
There are certain things we all can't do in public. Public officials should have enough guts (temperance) as to not wear their faith on their lapel. Idiotic prayers in the Senate will not make this country great. What will make it great is when the praying idiots in the senate stop lying to the public and actually do their damn jobs. <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/2/02 4:14:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waaaaaazup!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Or do you understand what it means for people of authority (especially public officials) to use their position of power and push their religious point of view onto those underneath them?

Is there such a thing as 'pushing religious' beliefs upon someone? I mean, is it really that great of an offense...or a offense at all? Most likely depends on the individual.<br>
<br>
I've heard that term many times in my life, and in some cases I would have to agree that some are zealots. But more then likely, if a Buddhist got up and started chanting his 'shaazams' over the PA or anywhere else, I would fall over laughing.<br>
<br>
Is the power and conviction of prayer so strong that it 'pressures' someone into guilt of obligation to bow their heads? Some forms of Christian religion promote raising ones hands and face, eyes wide open while speaking loudly and clearly to God. However, most of the time those prayers end with a Holy Ghost train formed and circling the room...talking about a 'captive audience'.<br>
<br>
Lurikeen, what kind of church did you attend when you were a wee lad and what was the turning point in your beliefs? I cant help but to think that at some point you were 'forced' to attend church.. Forgive me if ima wrong.<br>
