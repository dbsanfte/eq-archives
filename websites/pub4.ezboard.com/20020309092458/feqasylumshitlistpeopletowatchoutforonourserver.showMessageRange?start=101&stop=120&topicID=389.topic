<br>
Ahhh, I see. =) I had hoped that I was illustrating my experiences with Laaw.  I really do believe that a person can turn a corner, and rehabilitate ones image.<br>
<br>
But then, I *think* I get along with most people, too, so what do I know. =)<br>
<br>
I really only play a monk, so I take issues regarding the monk class pretty seriously, and Laaws image isn't the best.  Obviously he can still turn it around, but he has to really want to do it.  I can offer some suggestions, but Laaw is an avatar only. The player behind Laaw has to want to rehabilitate some as well.<br>
<br>
I recommend the following:<br>
<br>
1) Don't borrow your character or account to other people or friends.<br>
2) Don't loot for a while.  Just because something CAN be looted does not mean it NEEDS to be looted.  The majority of the issues revolving Laaw seem to be regarding loot. So, unless a group says loot, don't loot.  If you're accompanying a group, don't loot. Let the group loot unless they say take the loot from that mob.<br>
3) If you sign up for raids, be ontime or don't show up at all.<br>
4) You're a level 51 monk. Act like one. hehe.<br>
5) Please be courteous in game. I know sometimes you are, sometimes you aren't. Overall, being courteous means asking before inspecting, it also means not being quite so pushy.<br>
<br>
Anyway some food for thought. Hope all is well, and peace. =)<br>

But I was in Fear once with him awhile back...he was about...49?  I guess.  Anyway, I think this was his second mb even first Fear raid, I forget, but I know he was in my group for the majority of the raid.  I never saw any problems with him other than he talked alot.  He also liked to bug our Ranger and druid to see if Shiverbacks were on track (not rare, lots of people new to Fear bug druids and rangers, I hate it but what can ya do? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, he didn't get any loot that night, and he stayed the entire raid from start to finish, about 5 or 6 hours, that's just my experiences with Laaw, he did say something about the shitlist, which he was obviously worried the group knew of him, so he seemed like he was acting on his best behavior.  That's all I know about him, I won't speculate anything else.<br>
<br>
*Edit* Oh and I just remembered, this was a raid that started late because TA (ugh) went up and cleared Fear before the raid, so we had to wait for repop, raid started 2 hours late, and ended up going on until 3am CST, alot of people left, so the ones that stayed I believe were the most committed to going. <p><img SRC="http://user.netomia.com/dammned1/sig2.jpg"></br>

<br>
Many people stay extra and go that extra mile. Laaw has not really shown himself to be that type of person, yet. He may well in the future. It'd be a good thing when you looked a raid list and saw Laaw's name and could say, &quot;Wow, I'm glad he's coming along, we'll do well.&quot;.<br>
<br>
I suspect currently, that's not the case.<br>
<br>
Given the case where he did stay for the entire raid. /boggle. You're *supposed* to stay for the entire raid. Not getting any loot on a raid and staying for the entirety of it does not make you a hero.  It simply mean you fullfilled the expectations when you signed up to do a raid.<br>
<br>
=)<br>
<br>

I just stated the situation and what happened.  I know people are *supposed* to stay the entire raid, but from that raid being postponed because TA went up and cleared it before our raid, it started 2 hours later.  Like I said the raid  went till 3am CST, which was on a week night.  MANY people couldn't stay, so I believe it was valid to mention it.  No he's not a hero for staying late and I never made him out to be one, just posted my experiences with him as everyone else on this board has. <p><img SRC="http://user.netomia.com/dammned1/sig2.jpg"></br>

<br>
1 You are spossed to stay for the entire raid.<br>
<br>
Yeah if it wasnt for a thing called real life it would be a true utopia we live in, I for one have been on raids and have been fortunate to have been invited to them. although on 1 occasion a multi run naggy/lich in Everfrost/Vox raid I made the naggy dropped him, made the lich dropped him made the vox died massive CR took place of course people were gearing for the second and then my daughter started crying so i went afk she was very sick so i informed people I had to go I was the Healer for my group.  So the thing is we all want to stay but there are times we cant rather he did get called away by his dad who knows but id hate to think 1 person with a brain in EQ would exclude a person from having fun cos a true real life event occurs things happen.<br>
<br>
In fact I do believe there is a person in Tampa Fl who is up on manslaughter charges that played EQ so intently his daughter did die because he refused to leave the game and see what the matter was, very more criminal then son go to bed but just like i said throwing my 2cp in I know several people in EQ who are HS students and we might get to a place and pull 2 things and they have been told time to log do i curse them and say no more Trakanon for you or bah i ported you only to hear u have to log no cos that is REAL LIFE as opposed to the much more disirable world of EQ at times ;p<br>
<br>
2 if anyone ever told me it is a raid or my daughter guess id be leaving EQ<br>
<br>
<br>
As I said just my 2cp thrown in, I havent seen Laww since a time in Karnors where he stated nb4g loot and pulled rather well till we were trained very very badly atleast 4 times so I really hope he is on right track cos he seemed to be ok and that was a while back.<br>

<br>
Obviously real life concerns &quot;trump&quot; EQ. Hence, if you're on a raid and there's an emergency, etc, yes of course you should take of RL matters.  I've never said that you shouldn't, nor do I play the game that way.<br>
<br>
However, when you say you are going to do a raid, you should do so with every intention of actually being there at the beginning and at the end.  In the case of Laaw, the case was he was NOT there at the beginning, then showed up very late, looted one thing (without being asked), then left.<br>
<br>
That is a completely separate issue than someone neglecting his or her own child to play the game.  To even suggest that I even subscribe to a playstyle that would lead to that situation is fatuous nonsense.<br>
<br>
But, let's both take a step back and look at the big picture.  Everyone is completely entitled to join and leave a raid at anytime depending on what the raid leader decides, or even not (special circumstances, etc.).  We all pay our $10 a month.  Just don't expect some other people to be very happy if one does decide to just show up and then leave. Heh.<br>
<br>
Anyway, got some RL stuff to take care of right now. Peace. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulaaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/17/01 1:24:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Laaw -  Iskar monk, ninja looter</span><hr size=1> I know i usually can not stay the whole raid becuse something in real life comes up and well this is a Computer game.

However, when camps are called, you don't need to run through them all the time. Unintentional aggro can kill a group, or even the soloer.<br>
<br>
Also, if you really want to see if a mob is up, for instance, a fire giant or even King Tranix, please do a / druid, / ranger, or even / bard before trapsing through a zone/camp. These three classes have the ability to track mobs.<br>
<br>
You'll gain better faction with inhabitants of the zone that way as well.<br>

I dunno. To be honest, I've been in SolB only to hear the constant /ooc of &quot;Laaw, WTH you doing? I called this camp&quot; - paraphrasing of course.<br>
<br>
I dunno. Still way too much gray, and in groups he may do alright, individually when he's by himself and in zones, I'm still hearing alot of bad stuff.<br>
<br>
- Camps are called, and he *has* as recently as a week ago decided to go through those camps with aggro in SolB, or just waited in a spot close to the party causing aggro that trains the camp spot.<br>
<br>
This happens, and as recently as four days ago was the standard norm.  For every good post that someone puts up about him, I hear three bad things in /ooc and /shout.<br>
<br>
