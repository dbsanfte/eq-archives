Read this if you have no knowledge on this subject. (very graphic at points)</a><br><br>I Detest these things enough as it is.  With the more recent media exposure, I think this is becoming a more commonly accepted trend. This isn't going to be something I just sit back and "Accept."  I'm tired of people thinking they can just throw whatever ludicrous concept they want into the world, and everyone will have to come to terms with it, and accept it in their daily lives.  We have to tolerate all kinds of insane shit in our society today, but we shouldn't be forced to accept anything.  Thats for us to decide on our owns.<br><br>People that want to be animals, having sex with animals/people emulating animals/stuffed animals, of the same gender in many cases, all for the purpose of roleplaying.  Honestly, this is insanity to me.  I don't know how I would ever take a practitioner of this seriously.  I think one of the main reasons people are furries is due to the fact that they're interested in homosexuality, but are too afraid to experiment on their own, furries just being a veil for their already perverse interests.  Now, before you set your replies to "Flame with no remorse," let me say this:<br><br>I don't hate homosexuals.  Their sexual preference is their choice.  But, in the same sense, I don't have to accept them either.  I have, do, and will always think of homosexuality as nothing more then an extreme fetish, one of many.  Its the same as if someone came up to me and said "I eat shit for sexual arousal."  Why should I accept this? They consume the waste our bodies produce! Where is the logic in that?<br>I view homosexuals in the same light.  Because their choices defy what I belive is one of the prime physical staples of us as living beings, it's my opinion that homosexuality is wrong; the same way i think about most other fetishes. If this makes me "an ignorant gaybashing redneck" to you, then I don't think I'm the person with problem here.  I have alot more issuses with furries either way.<br><br>I thought that the Vah Shir was a neat concept for a race, but, this falling in with the furry crowd really ruined it for me.  I don't like having things I like being pulled under a perverse title.  I'll never accept claims like Felicia (my favorite darkstalkers character), the numerous kinds of cat-people seen far and wide in anime titles, and even concepts such as the Japanese tengu or kitsune hengei youkai (or all hengei youkai) are now considered "Furry things."  I don't want to have to defend the things I stand for because some guy dressed up like a lion happens to jack off to them and then makes this apparent to the world.<br><br>I potentially pissed off alot of people with this, but I felt it needed to be said, and I know someone out there must agree with me... <p><BR><img src="http://azuza.homestead.com/files/azuzasig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uderisweikath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deris Weikath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 2:18:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1656.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.destroyersofthefaith.com/~myg0t/pldecal13-ct.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Furries.</span><hr size=1> Rawwwwwwr!<br><br>Azuza does make a fine point... Those type of furries are quite sickining. I personally think that when a furrie begins looking more like an ANIMAL rather than a skimpily dressed catgirl with skin a tail,and a human face... It starts to get really sick. <br><br>The thought of sex with an animal or anything that resembles one is simply sick. It in NO way should be accepted in any form or fashion,It's as bad if not WORSE than eating shit as a sexual fetish..<br><br>If you did not take the time to read over the documentation carefully,let me quote the three best lines for you.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Tyger's St. Louis home boasts the best of furry art.

Most simply have sex with one another or with themselves, or they are merely nerds who love role-playing games, spend hours chatting on the Internet and occasionally download dirty pictures, albeit ones featuring human-animal hybrids.

Otherwise you need to lump in all the crap that also comes with being heterosexual as well. Some gay men prefer certain types of men, just as some straight men prefer certain types of women. Homosexuality has been both accepted and damned by various societies since the dawn of human civilization, and frankly I don't want to get into another discussion thread on it especially in one dealing with bizarre sexual fetishes. It's sexuality plain and simple. And personally I think if anyone is going to label homosexuality as a fetish, then you need to label heterosexuality a fetish as well. Frankly I don't think either fall under a fetish, and since that's an entirely different topic of discussion, I really doubt that belongs here.<br><br>Now, there's people out there into things that quite frankly boggle the imagination. I could provide a list and links, but this site already does. Feel free to look through them, it's like visiting a freak show on spanish fly.<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.odd-sex.com/info/index2.htm">www.odd-sex.com/info/index2.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br><br>Now here's my opinion, and solely my opinion. I'm going to call this <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Jerry Springer Syndrome</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br><br>Even 'normal' couples, whatever they are, sometimes engage in fantasy roleplaying. I know completely normal people who have confided in me that they have certain fantasies that they roleplay with their partner. This may envolve costumes, such as Superman, or a police officer, or it may envolve more indepth roleplay where they play out scenarios, or pretend to be certain people.<br><br>Unhealthy? As long as they're not hurting themselves, or other people...and as long as they're not obessesing on it to the point where they're unable to maintain any form of normal arousal without their personal little fetishes, I'd say probably not.<br><br>However...<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> they don't publically discuss it</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br><br>Most topics surrounding sex do not come up in polite conversation. Hence the Jerry Springer Syndrome. <br><br>Some people feel the need to publically disclose all the gory details of their sexual escapades. Some to gain the titilation of the attention. That's a fetish unto itself. It's akin to publically exposing yourself for the gasps and screams you'll get from others. They literally get off on it. Other people seem to need validation. See, I'm not a freak, there's other people that are into this, right? And finally some people are seeking other people who will play their sexual games with them. And I'm sure there are many people who are a varying mix of all three of those.<br><br>Do I have to accept that Bob likes dressing up like a tiger on the weekends and stares into a mirror while jacking off? No, I sure don't. Bob can do whatever he likes, and frankly Bob can keep it in the bedroom. However I'm sure as hell not going to go picket Bob's house because he likes to do that. He's not hurting himself or other people. I think it's strange, and bizarre. And I may think Bob's probably not as happy as he could be, and maybe he's engaging in some of that behavior because of some underlying problems. We all have weird things about us (though not that weird) and he probably functions pretty well beyond his fetish. However, no the mainstream doesn't have to accept it. They do have to respect his freedom to engage in that behavior if he chooses. He's not going to get locked up for it. However, they also probably really don't want to hear about it.<br><br>As far as beastality goes? Illegal. And it should be. I have 2 dogs, 2 cats, a parrot and fish. I assure you that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> none</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of my pets want to be sexually assaulted by a human being. And yes, beyond the fact that it's absolutely abusive to the animal, it's pretty fucking sick. Falls under hurting someone else, because they're harming that animal. That's not something that society should be forced to ever accept. <br><br>Anyone who harms animals in order to obtain their sexual gratification has some serious fucking problems.<br><br>There's arguments that people who are into beastality put forth, and far more valid counterarguments. I assume I'd be preaching to the choir getting into them, so I won't. <br><br>The fact of the matter is, regardless of what you're into...most people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don't want to hear the details. <br><br>People are free to engage in whatever sexual behaviors don't harm themselves or other people. I'm free to think some of those behaviors are disgusting, and in some cases pretty fucking pathological. Accepting something means pretty much that I accept and uphold their right to do it. And they have that right. However I also have the right to think it's pretty fucked up and freaky. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As long as they're not hurting themselves, me or other people, I really don't care though.<br><br>I think the same is true of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> sexual practice. You don't have to like it. You can think it's pretty twisted. You can think it's wrong. But if it's not harming you, or others than live and let live. Why should you care what other people are doing with their lives in that fashion, as long as it's not hurting you or other people. I'm just not that obssessed with what other people are doing in their bedrooms.<br><br>And in some cases...I really don't want to know.

I'm talking about mating displays between two male ostriches, in the wild, that start as the normal heterosexual display and end in a significantly different manner.

Sort of a live and let live attitude. For example I dont give a rats ass about drugs in this country because if an educated person wants to smoke crack knowing what it will do to them wants to smoke..be my guest..its thier life, smoke all the damn crack you want.  However I must concur with the original posters idea that Homosexuality is a sexual fetish. The dictionary defines the word &quot;normal&quot; this way:<br><br>SYLLABICATION: nor·mal <br>PRONUNCIATION:   nôrml <br>ADJECTIVE: 1. Conforming with, adhering to, or constituting a norm, standard, pattern, level, or type; typical: normal room temperature; one's normal weight; normal diplomatic relations. 2. Biology Functioning or occurring in a natural way; lacking observable abnormalities or deficiencies.  <br><br>So no, Homosexuality is NOT a normal thing to do.  Trying to assertain that Heterosexuality is equal to Homosexuality in terms of being a fetish could not be more incorrect.  A heterosexual coupling by design fits the intent of our biology to reproduce ourselves and therefore a normal condition.  While homosexuality does not fit the function and design of our species or produce anything. I am not placing a value judgment on people that choose to do this or trying to start a debate but I totally agree with the original poster's viewpoint; that having things poseing as normal or mainstream being forced down our throats that we must accept, I find intolerable. <p><b><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=68788'>Oxoxo Xoxox</a></b> lvl 57 Evoker<BR><b><a href='http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=57344'>Rubix Stumpyshorts</a></b> lvl 30 Cleric <br>Oxoxo Xoxox lvl 17 Lukreen Eldritch<br>Xoxox Oxoxo lvl 24 Lukreen Mentalist<br>Ouji lvl 10 Lukreen Nightshade<br><A HREF="http://www.mithrilweb.com" target="blank"><img src="http://www.queensidecastle.com/eq/Luclinepic.jpg" border="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uanathae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anathae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3! </span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/6/02 11:48:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1656.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://tsaule.freeservers.com/a2.gif WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Furries.</span><hr size=1> fet·ish also fet·ich (ftsh, ftsh)<br>n. <br>1: An object that is believed to have magical or spiritual powers, especially such an object associated with animistic or shamanistic religious practices. <br>2: An object of unreasonably excessive attention or reverence: made a fetish of punctuality. <br>3: Something, such as a material object or a nonsexual part of the body, that arouses sexual desire and may become necessary for sexual gratification. <br>4: An abnormally obsessive preoccupation or attachment; a fixation. <br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[French fétiche, from Portuguese feitiço, artificial, charm, from Latin factcius, artificial.

What does that mean really? If you dont agree with the homo-sexual lifestyle then uhm.... dont have sex with another man. I just dont get what people mean when they say they wont accept it, are they saying they wont engage in the activity? Are they saying they will make it hell if homo- sexuals move into their neighborhood? Are they saying if they are in charge of hiring they would refuse a job to a homo-sexual? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? I dont accept my next door neighbor is 80 yrs old, does this change his age in any way. Is it my place to accept it or not accept it. Isnt he, who he is, whether I &quot;accept&quot;it or not?<br><br>Fetishes, could care less what people like or dont like. If its illegal, then they should go to jail (like adults who like children sexually, that is illegal and should not be tolerated). But people who like to dress up in Furry costumes and have sex, I dont care really. I think its strange but not my problem, they arent bothering me in any way. <br><br>There are people who dont &quot;accept&quot; inter-racial couples. There are people who wont &quot;accept&quot; that my son is a product of an inter-racial couple. He is mixed, his dad is black and I am white. For people who dont accept this, my only reply would be that I dont recall asking for or needing their acceptance. My son exists whether they like it or not, I exist whether they like it or not, their non-acceptance dosent change this a bit. They have every right to avoid social interaction with me, and I would have to agree on that  since I wouldnt want to be involved with them socially any way. They dont have to engage in inter racial relations in any way. Why do they feel the need to tell me they dont &quot;accept&quot; me or my son. Why do they think their acceptance is so dam important to me. I imagine gay men and women feel the same, but I dont speak for them, just a guess on my part.<br><br>BTW be careful, homo-sexuals were accused of being the child molesters of the world also, this was found to be completely untrue. If you dont agree with homo-sexuality, dont use illegal sexual behavior to prove your point against them. It isnt valid. If it was then hetero-sexuals are just as deviant. Rape is illegal, yet it is committed by hetero-sexuals in many of the cases, does this prove that hetero-sexual males are all dangerous rapists? There are sexual deviants of the gay community and also in the hetero-sexual community, what does this prove? It proves that humans can do some fucked up shit. Lots of strange but legal sexual fetishes out there, straight and gays do them. So what? How did strange sexual fetishes become a gay issue? Oh I know, the original poster has somthing against gays and saw somthing he thought was inflammatory and attached gay to it hoping people would then all proclaim the gay community evil and abolish them at once. hahhaha good luck, havent been able to since time began.....<br><br>I heard some married couples do this thing called &quot;swinging&quot;. I think thats perverted and I think we should abolish marriage, so they cant do that anymore. /nod. I will submit the petition next week.

I wanted to uhm... well you know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I never THOUGHT about it, I just felt the attraction and strangely only for men, not all men of course. When I saw a pretty girl, I could see she was pretty but I did not feel any attraction towards her sexually at all. I may have felt I didnt want my boyfriend to see her, cause maybe I wished I had hair like hers or a body like hers, but I DID NOT want to touch it. I didnt decide to be straight, I just am.<br><br>My gay friends second question was this<br><br>&quot;if for some reason you had to move to a community where gay was the norm, would you be gay to fit in and be accepted as normal or would you find yourself at the underground straight clubs?'<br><br>I thought about it, I tried to imagine myself being with a women sexually, etc. To be honest, I dont think I could do it. Not saying it would kill me, but truth is there is no sexual attraction there. I would be found in the underground straight club and deal with the bullshit that followed instead of trying to feel somthing I dont.<br><br>Yes sex between man and woman can make babies, but lets be honest, straight people have sex alot and we dont do it to make babies except a few times in life. If I had a kid for everytime I had sex I wouldnt be able to afford them!! If I wasnt allowed to have sex unless it was for the purpose of making a kid, dam life would suck. There are couples who cant have babies at all, they are still a valid couple and normal, there are couples who dont want kids at all, we dont deny them the title of normal. <br><br><br>I wont say that if my 10 yr old grows up and tells me he is gay that I will throw a parade and be thrilled. I would worry for all the reactions he would get, and yes think about the fact that I may not get grandchildren from him. But I would love him the same and respect my son and welcome his boyfriend into my home. I would bitch his boyfriend dosent take care of him properly and be the pain in the ass mother in law I look forward to being.
