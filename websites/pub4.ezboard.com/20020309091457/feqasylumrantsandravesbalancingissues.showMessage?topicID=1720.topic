Grouped pets do /not/ steal exp unless by some miracle they outdamage the whole group. And Fluffy may not be in the league of a mage or necro pet, but drop haste, dex and str on him and you have a permanent no-mana DOT. Plus he looks cute.<br><br>I hate shamans like you who insist on nuking every fight and then complain you're out of mana. Out DOTs are the greatest gift Verant ever gave us, and even in a fast-pulling group the poison ones are still well worth the casting. They're far more mana efficient than nukes.<br><br>I hate shamans like you who drop every buff known to man on the tanks at the start of the group, then complain you're OOM. /Selectively/ buff. And stagger the casting so you spread the different buffs out over 20 minutes. Plus cast them /all/ on yourself at the same time you do the tanks - it doesn't take that much mana, and you've got a timer for every buff - when it fades, reapply on everyone. A shaman who has to be asked to renew buffs is not doing his job, IMHO. Get your group used to the idea that they'll get the buffs, they don't have to whine for them. The next good shaman to group with this lot will bless you for training them well  <br><br>I hate shamans like you who 'won't cannibalise'. WHY NOT!!!! Cannibalise plus regen or even better chloroplast is the nearest you'll get to clarity without retraining as a chanter  <br><br>I hate shamans like you who haven't learned that while you may be the backup healer, in the absence of a chanter you are /far/ more use slowing the mobs, as it'll reduce the damage taken by the tanks ten times more then you could heal. Just keep that bit of mana for healis if it all goes pear shaped.<br><br>I hate shamans like you who don't do enough soloing to keep your weapon skills up. You are not a tank. But you can produce a damned good imitation if all else fails. You get decent AC. Use it.<br><br>I hate shamans like you, because it means that every time I group with a group who've had a bad shaman. they don't like me summoning a pet because he sucks mana, whine at me for every buff from the word go, panic if I cannibalise, and say they don't want me to apply any damage spell as I need the mana for heals, and don't dare let me tank even in an emergency because I &quot;can't take the aggro&quot;....<br><br>Shamans are one of the best classes in Norrath. And most shaman players are some of the best players in Everquest. So why, why, why must a small minority mess up things for the rest of us. Read.

Most groups I've joined in DL ask/tell/beg me not to summon without making damn sure that Gore is down. When in dungeons or on raids, I don't summon unless asked/told to... too damn hard to control sometimes AND keep the group buffed/healed/sped and the mobs slowed.<br><br>Nuking: Most fights I've been in don't last long enough to get the dot off and still have time for a tick or two.. nuke is much easier. In a good group, but the time you slow there is no time left for a dot. When the shit hits the fan and the cleric/chanter have aggro and the tanks haven't caught it yet Slow and Nuke are our biggest taunts.<br><br>Buffs: Most groups I've been in complain if they don't have all the buffs they want as soon as I am in group. If I'm in a good group, I'm gonna be there for hours... and after the 3rd round the buffs are spread out. But I don't like spreading them too much.. then it feels like I am constantly buffing.  The timer is the best thing EVER. If for some reason I've gone LOM (hardly ever OOM) I let the tanks know that I don't have &lt;insert buff&gt; timed due to mana/battle constraints .. they always understand and I either refresh sooner or they let me know when it starts to drop.<br><br>Cannabalize and Slow: AGREE SO MUCH!<br><br>Weapons skill: If it comes down to me needed to tank a mob, I hope we are not relying on MY MELEE attacks to kill it. I can tank em pretty good, but a true tank is a meat shield not a damage dealer.<br><br>Groups with Bad Shaman experience: FUCK EM ... either tell them to do their job and you will do yours THE WAY YOU SEE FIT, find another group, or turn the damn tables on em.. tell the monk he can't pull for shit, tell the tank he should let the chanter be the meat shield because he's dieing too fast. ROFL its not the shaman's fault that some people are asses and have no clue how THAT DAMN GOOD we are!<br><br>ps, sorry for the length, but this hit the spot OH SO WELL.. everything I'd been thinkin for quite some time now.<br><br>/cheer Shaman!!!<br> <p><center><TABLE BACKGROUND="http://www.elltel.net/ethernexus/images/daback.jpg"BORDER="1"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><B><h4>Lelanie Frostspirit</h4><BR>Tribunal Shaman of the 49th Winter<BR>Assistant Guild Leader of the <A HREF="http://www.dragonsalliance.com"> Dragons Alliance</A>.<BR>"Bringing the Spirit to you,<br> cause the Frost is just too cold"<BR></B> <IMG SRC="http://www.elltel.net/ethernexus/images/medals/level40.gif"><IMG SRC="http://www.elltel.net/ethernexus/images/medals/officer.gif"></TD></TR><tr><td>Raid count:<br><b>PoH: 6       PoF: 1       Vox: 1/2       Naggy: 1/1 </b></tr></TABLE></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigottomuchgameforyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>igottomuchgameforyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/15/02 1:38:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1720.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate shamans like you...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I hate shamans like you, who turn up in a group and won't summon a pet because &quot;my pet sux and he steals exp anyway&quot;.

Hopefully you shamen can set me straight with reguard to bear form.<br><br>Bear form has caused me no end of trouble. I am a necro which meant I twitch. I do not twitch Shamem though. Why, because i can pact them 320 hps over 20 sec, for 5 mana. Then they cani that down to get 150 mana or so. I then tap my hps from the back from the mob for 200 mana. doing this i could keep a shaman buddy nearly full mana forever as long as the pulls keep coming. twitching gives 150mana for 400 of my mana. So for 200 mana i get the equiv of a twitch and 300+ dd to the mob.<br><br>So whats the problem? Pacts will not stack with bear form.

Period.  Fido might do about 400 to 500 DPM, if is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> lucky and just sucked up about 1k mana in buffs.  Generally, its not worth the effort to keep it buffed.  If I need a mob dead, quick, I EBolt it and move on.  Pet requires maintenance:  Heals, buffs, and occasionally multiple back down commands.  If I'm root parking mobs, they complicate my positioning of mobs.  If there is an enchanter in the group... I end up on more than just a MOBs hate list.  Unless my shaman has a permanent &quot;ass goes here&quot; spot on the floor, pets simply don't get popped.<br><br>NUKES:  I've used nukes once.  That was on a hate raid, 2nd floor, and then simply because I simply couldn't get slows to land anymore and got tired of feeling useless.  Otherwise, I have no use for them.  Might be nice for those shaman with JBB, but unfortunately not an option for Iksar.<br><br>DOTS:  I tend to reserve these for named mobs, only.  Don't have enough mana otherwise, to use them every time.  If a mob needs to go down, fast, they go in.<br><br>BUFFS:  Yes, I try to time these.  The problem with timing buffs, however, is zones like Sebilis.  The froggies dispel.  A lot.  It is nothing to have the puller loose a couple buffs one pull, then have the primary tank loose a couple the next.  This complicates timing.  And the froggies <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> fucking dispel the most expensive spells first.  Never fails.<br><br>If people start getting dispelled, I don't time.  Period.  They either ask or they don't get it.  If they are too lazy to ask, they must not need it anyways.  (Believe me, a melee <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ask for a buff, if they feel its important.)<br><br>MELEE SKILLS:  LoL.  Unless I get my shaman a weapon <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> close to a 1/1 ratio (i.e. primal, NToV, or Ssra drop) I'm not even gonna try.  My little spine chill spear (10/2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  doesn't do much to the mobs at 58.  I actually think the mobs laugh at me when I try to use it.  Can't see using a 2HB either, cuz I need the WIS and mana the spear + shield combo affords me.<br><br>As to what I define the shaman roles.  Well, in order of importantance:<br><br>1 - Debuffer:  Nothing is more important than getting a mob slowed, ASAP.  On named mobs, or anything with massive damage, I malosini first so slow--generally--will stick on the first try.  Sucks getting hammered by unslowed mobs.  Otherwise I just slow, and (if mana is holding good) I cripple.<br><br>2 - Crowd Control: After the mob is debuffed and pissed at me, I root park it somewhere away from the camp if I'm the crowd control.<br><br>3 - Buffer: Melee need STR and haste above everything.  Regeneration is the next priority.  After that, damage takers get stamina and agility.  Casters get stamina and Kragg if they want it.  Dexterity and charisma are luxury spells; they only get cast if asked for (I don't work with chanters or bards often enough to remember using charisma).<br><br>4 - Damage:  If mana is good, the party is buffed, and the mobs are debuffed I might land an ebolt or plague.  Never before I've buffed/debuffed though.<br><br>Petting has a priority on my list between buffing and damage, if I plan to use one, though generally I do not.  Pets, to me, are just a pain in the ass.  Maybe when I get /pet HOLD I'll change my mind, but until then... /pet get lost.<br><br>Beyond that... *shrug*.  I think its a moot point.  Each to their own.  What I do works for me.  What other shaman do works for them.  If they aren't getting a group killed, just leave 'em the fuck alone. <p>Shallandra McKnight, Uba Monkey<br>Zassazy Moonkiepett, Sexy Leezard Shaman<br>Daxes Solvaires, Naughty Flute Girl<br>Daemonica, Evil Daughter of Innoruuk<br><br>"Train?
