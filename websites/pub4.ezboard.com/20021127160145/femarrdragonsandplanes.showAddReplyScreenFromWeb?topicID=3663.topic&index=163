How about someone bring up something to flame about my post's (other then bad spelling/typos *snicker*). Almost everyone on this thread has been attacking Kilmal in game and IRL. Have you nothing better to do then insult someone with the same crap? Take a minute to read my post on page 6. And then argue with me about it. I think i am able to think a little more clearly then Kilmal can about this, as I am a little less angry (not that i am not pissed about this, but just for different reasons) then he is. <br>
<br>
Legion of Ka was a guild that mine once respected. No longer. The fact that the leader allows such trash to be posted by her members makes me think less of them then a newbie guild filled with LVL 10s. If you would have stuck with contructive critisim and/or just kept it as a &quot;warning&quot; I really would not have had much to say other then to speak on Kilmal's behalf as far as his personality. But the more posts I read about this, the less I think of all of you that are posting this garbage. Gloriana, I can respect what you tried to say, and perhaps Kilmal should have tried different tactics, although I do not see how he could have in that situation (i.e. the area that they were fighting in, and the fact that the group seemed, at least to me, like they wanted him to be slowing / debuffing the mobs so he wouldn't have had the correct spells for many other tactics). Perhaps he should not have had gate up. But there are only a few times when I (necro) do not have FD up. Part of it is to lose aggro so i can over DoT mobs when we over-pull, but also the only time I do not have it up is when i am with people I feel i can trust not to screw up so badly that we can not recover. I seriously doubt that there was a whole lot of trust in this group at least between Kilmal and the others. You may be on raids with people you know well, and trust or so they know what they were doing. Now this group for whatever reason, did not seem to know what they were doing in this zone. Dark feel into a trap (not blaming, just making a point) Kilmal and the pally had never been to the zone before, and I am not sure about the others. But my point is that they were not working as a team, and when you are not working as a team you feel like you have to look after yourself (i.e. get yourself out if things go badly).<br>
<br>
To the rest of you posters that do not know anyone involved, were not there and are just posting as you can insult someone to make yourself feel better. Langree, you happen to be one of the worst. I do not know where you come off insulting people like you are better then everyone, but I got news for you, your not impressing me or anyone that I know that I have had read this. You are a laughing stock for your immature insults and petty behavior.<br>
<br>
I generally try to keep the peace between people, but my god, if none of you will see reason, and just continue ranting on and on without even trying to understand then you need to grow up. If you would like to discuss this as an ADULT then feel free to quote anything out of my first 3 posts and I will more then happy to DISCUSS them with you. Not bitch back and forth like 14 year old girls. Most of you posting (not all, but most) are trying to act like you are just being noble. I'm sorry to say but I am not buying it, nor are the people that  have talked to. Although they will not post as they do not want their reputation damaged by this, and they do not know Kilmal nor do they have any information that is relevent to this, although seems like very few of you do. I am not so weak hearted. I will defend a player if I feel they are being truely attacked with no reason other then to harm the person behind the player.<br>
<br>
I encourage you to find flaws with my points in my previous posts, as I learn from others points of views. However if you are just going to TRY to insult me, don't bother as if you are someone that is like that, you are most likly beneath notice. I hope that someone here has the guts to even try to have a real discussion of the ISSUES of this whole event with me. I noticed not one person from Ka has even tried other then to try to question whether or not I have REALLY known him that long.... As if I would be here defending someone whole heartedly that I barely knew? Or to question where I came up with my information on whether or not the druid was lost, when it was stated in their own guildie's post. Is that it? Is that all you can come up with? You got to give me something better then that. My posts are on pages, 2, 6 and 7 if you would like to try. If not. Stop posting, as posting any further insults, just makes you look ignorant and unwilling to have a real discussion of the issues.<br>
<br>
Also, feel free to send me a tell in-game. I will be happy to discuss it with any of you in-game once I am not in the middle of a fight and have some time to sit down and talk.<br>
<br>
I'll be waiting.......<br>
<br>
P.S. Once again sorry for any spelling errors / typos <p><h4><font color="#00ffff">_______________________</font></h4><h4><font color="blue">- If ignorance is bliss, why aren't more people happy?</font></h4>

Issues? As in more than one? I only see one issue myself. He gated out of danger (no problem here), then left his group to fend for themselves for no other reason than it not being worth his time (very big problem here). That's the only issue I see.<br>

<br>
I call horse-puckey.<br>
Post the day you entered active service.<br>
Your PEBD, or Pay Entry Base Date, would be fine.<br>
Then post your last day of active military service.  Obviously not your original EAOS (End Active Obligated Service), since you were disabled.<br>
<br>
That's not classified information.  I'm not asking for your social security #, mission names, or other information that would get you in trouble.  Not that a bulk ammo delivery driver would have been privy to much anyway.<br>
<br>
I Read Stormin Norman's, &quot;It Doesn't Take a Hero&quot;.  Why don't you read it &amp; get back to us.  Oh, yeah, I was serving on active duty during Desert Shield &amp; Storm, and I'm still active duty today.  So I take your little negative remarks about the military personally.  Even if you were mainly talking about ground-pounders.<br>
<br>
You violated the UCMJ several times according to your own posts.  But the Code of Conduct is not the UCMJ.  Your lack of knowledge here also makes your vet story suspect.  Note the fact I'm not calling you a liar about your supposed service.  Yet.  Because once again I've served w/ people who were CLUELESS about actual military policy when they were getting out after their 4 year minimum tour.<br>
<br>
Your continued failure to realize what a horrible mistake it is to abandon your groupmates to CR on their own is what makes your mistake so much worse.  It is really the only point the original poster was making and it is a valid one.<br>
<br>
The preoccupation you have with wisdom for a troll shaman merely displays your lack of knowledge about shaman equipment priorities.  The fact that you don't see why this isn't a good thing merely emphasizes my point.  You posted your spell lineup (HoS? /boggle), which I quoted in my post.  If you don't see the mistakes there, I'm not going to point them out to you. <br>
<br>
Langree, thanks for the offer to drag my bearhide across Velk's.  But I'm pretty much done w/ that zone unless I need to farm Velium.  Got my stupid threads, I own shawl #6 (but don't wear it, how's that for irony), so no reason to go back there.  Thanks also for your words of support. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We need to group together again.
