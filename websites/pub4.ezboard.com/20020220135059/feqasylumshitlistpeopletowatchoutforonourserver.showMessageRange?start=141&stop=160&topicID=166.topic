I'm sure the real life person behind Uzziell has a chance at redemption, however, in the eyes of the server, the character Uzziell does NOT.  If he *really* wants respect, he'll scrap Uzziell, start a twink, and ACT HUMANE all the way up to level 60.  He'll stop KS'ing, play honorably, and not backstab.  But he doesn't care that much. There will *always* be a guild for a level 60 wizard.. even if he's naked.  Though I don't agree with it.. that's the way it is.<br>
<br>
A word on the &quot;Guild by Association&quot;: If your guild allows a member of the community with a reputation as bad as Uzziells (he either has the worst rep or the second-to-worst, being surpassed only by Lumi), then you accept the consequences that go with it.  All we have in Everquest are our reputations, if you hang out with an asshole, you appear to be an asshole yourself.  Relation to real life: Osama Bin Ladin (OBL) is currently known for being an &quot;asshole&quot; because of the WTC.  Even though other sections of the Taliban may not have known about the WTC events until they happened, they're guilty - BY ASSOCIATION - and are being persectued too.  In law, it's called aiding and abetting (can't spell that).<br>

<br>
The clarification of exactly what happened, (although brief) is all mself and Glor's close friends sought.  Perhaps the entire even went to shit, and perhaps he ahd a part in that.  What I appreciate is that your most recent post admits, that there is NO real &quot;blame&quot; to be laid in relation to this incident.<br>
<br>
A strong salute, and the utmost respect.  It take true courage and vast integrity to come to a post on page 6 and openly admit that either the post was wrong OR it was misinterpreted.<br>
Either way, I am most pleased to see some integrity.<br>
As for the comments about the maturity level of some folks on this board, /agree.  There are a LOT of pointless posts about nothing.  I will point out that there are a lot of useful, insightful posts as well.<br>
Still, filtering through the trash for gems is a pain in the ass. <p><center><br> With love comes purpose, commitment and dedication.<br>With these, come ferocity and courage.<br>With these, success is only a matter of time.<br>

We all know what a rotten piece of shit this player is. How could a guild possibly take this character?<br>
<br>
A member doesnt reflect a guild....<br>
<br>
Why not? It reflects the guilds moral values. Is IRIS a guild that supports and harbors the crimminals of norrath? Sorry to say, but quite a few members that were shit listed are in IRIS.<br>
<br>
What does that say about the guild? Think about it...If you hang out with a bunch of thugs and people walk past you everyday and see you hanging out with these thugs. What the hell do you think these people are going to think you are? A THUG!!!!<br>
<br>
Think for a change!<br>
<br>
Any guild Uzziell is in, is a guild I know I want nothing to do with.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
A note to IRIS, I would slow down on your admissions of new members into the guild, that it your problem right there...<br>
<br>
I went on a mini-arena raid with IRIS a while back... I was the only non IRIS guild member in the group.<br>
<br>
YOUR OWN GUILD MEMBERS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER?!!??!<br>
<br>
Guildie_01 says 'Hi, everyone else from IRIS too?'<br>
Guildie_02 says 'Yeah! never seen your before, hi!'<br>
Guildie_03 says 'who are you guildie_01, and guildie_02, I don't think I have met you yet'<br>
Guildie_04 says 'Hi everyone, I'm guildie_04, nice to meet you all'<br>
Guildie_05 (officer I believe) says 'who are you guildie_02'<br>
<br>
That right there tells me a lot about your guild =)<br>

I promised myself I wouldn't but hey, what the hell. <br>
<br>
First. I will be the first to admit we got too big too fast. Officers got a little too into the /guildinviting. That ok though. Pink Slips are being handed out to those who dont deserve a job here.<br>
<br>
Second. I keep a very close eye on Uzziell. Whether you like it or not, he's one of the best wizards on the server. Yes, everyone has character flaws. I do, and you do...deal. <br>
<br>
Third. No one is forcing you to raid with us. No one is twisting your arm to do ANYTHING with us. If you hate us so god damned much, then dont ask me for help nor my guild. I dont care. Im here for my guys and those who respect them.<br>
<br>
Neesha. While I understand where you're coming from, but it's bullshit. Why dont you talk to the wizard in Vita who got the VS staff from an Iris only raid and I LET him in because he was on his last peice and I had wizards there. ALSO, this was AFTER you made the decision not to let my guildmembers participate on Vita events. I will never stoop as low as to prevent a person from entering a raid because of a guildtag. This pisses me off. I got an email from you saying you were sorry for your harshness and I get this shit on the boards? Nice.<br>
<br>
Personally, I dont care about what happened in the past. If Uzziell fucks up in the present, feel free to tell me, email me, post it on our boards, get logs, screenshots, do what you have to do. And FYI I did NOT invite Uzziell because he was a 60 wizard. I invited Uzziell as his alt. I could care less if he was lvl 60...I like the guy. He may think and act differently than you, but given the right setting, you'll learn to appreciate his skill as a wizard and passion for being the best.<br>
<br>
If you would like to alienate people for Uzziell's membership, thats cool. I toyed with the idea of removing him to save face, like a coward, but when I brought it up to my members, they wouldn't have it. Hell, I would have lost more members if I disbanded him than because we are looked upon as bad people. <br>
<br>
About Kedge. I think it was a misunderstanding when Glori was posted here. I dont think she meant any ill intent be doing so. I'll stick up for Glori to the end but honestly I just dont think she meant to start this flame war, (which is all this board is good for anymore). Perhaps something constructive can come out of this. <br>
<br>
My little 2 cents...(NOT cp...)<br>
<br>
This is a game...If Uzziell's presence in the game bothers you so much, quit. OR perhaps avoid HIM not US. I dont know what you people want from me as a guildleader. As neesha said, should I &quot;do the right thing&quot; and remove Uzziell? I think not. Im not down with that kind of bullshit and I dont feel it's the &quot;right&quot; thing to do to remove him. I have 2 people in my guild that have been shitlisted ( to my knowledge )<br>
<br>
Uzziell-haven't seen an infraction of the play nice policy since he's carried an Iris tag...<br>
<br>
Zoccola-wow all those nice things people had to say about her. Perhaps people CAN change...<br>
<br>
My suggestion to you is to is remember this is a game...loosen your panties a bit eh?<br>

<br>
Perhaps you should look at the dates of my post, read my email, and not jump to conclusions.  You may or may not know this, but recently, there was some confusion regarding the Monk Epic between a Monk in your Guild and one in mine.  Without getting into details, Vita took down the final mob for the Monk Epic while a few members from Iris were waiting to do the same.  There was some miscommunication involved, but ultimately, I asked my Guild to help your Monk get his Epic three hours later.  I could have easily said &quot;he is in Iris... Uzziell is in Iris, so screw him&quot; but I didn't.  I wanted to help, and I made sure my people were there to do the same.  Actually, there were more Vita members there than there were Iris members there and we had nothing to gain other than seeing someone get his hard-earned Epic.<br>
<br>
As I told you in my email, I don't discriminate against people because of their guild tag (regardless what I may have posted here).

<br>
He's a charmer. <br>
<br>
He will actually talk to you, as he did with me once when I was still playing and refused to group with him.<br>
<br>
What he generally says is either rationalization, justification, or apologizes for his previous actions. Yes, he's changed. Time and time and time again, he's changed. Reminds me of how they portray Saddam Hussein on South Park. And he's completely disarming and understanding. Very much not a dick...when he has a motive not to be a dick.<br>
<br>
And that tends to impress people. <br>
<br>
And that would work.<br>
<br>
Except...that pattern has played itself out numerous times with this person with numerous people.<br>
<br>
He has an absolute history of winning time and time again people's trust and completely and <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>totally</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> betraying that. From the first time he ninja looted a crown off the FGs (which was I believe the first time he was shitlisted) until now.<br>
<br>
Sure, you can judge people on your own, and make what decisions you will about how you run your guild and the people you have in it.<br>
<br>
But when you have this volume of people with history on Lanys telling you repeatedly that this is the exact same scenario he's worked on other people, then frankly you're a fool not to listen. <br>
<br>
Doesn't hurt any of these people. It will eventually hurt you, the people in your guild, and your guild. Reread this post. See how many people here gave him numerous chances. See how many people here previously <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> defended</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> him.<br>
<br>
Sorry, at what point do you finally realize no matter how many chances someone is given, no matter how charming or disarming they are, when they repeatedly act out in ways he has that they're not going to change. And he never did. He just managed to fool people, to get what he wants. <br>
<br>
Granted, my mind was made up back in the day when he ninja looted and gated with the loot. However READ THE POSTS, and see how many people here have given him numerous chances and have only been burned by it. <br>
