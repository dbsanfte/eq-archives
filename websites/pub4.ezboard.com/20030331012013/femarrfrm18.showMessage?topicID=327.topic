<br>
Here is the problem:<br>
<br>
1) Iraq must allow for new unconditional weapons inspections per agreement in 1991. If not then the US and her allies will strike militarily even with out support of the UN Security council.<br>
<br>
2) Iraq has agreed to the terms of unconditional weapon inspections as defined in 1991 after the Gult War, but that is no longer good enough. The UN Security council needs to frame a new resolution, which Russia is sure to reject if it involves any unilateral military action by the US and or Britain. In which case, the US will claim that the weapons inspections per the already agreed upon terms lack enforceability and will wage war against Iraq any way.<br>
<br>
In either case, Iraq is sure to get the living snot bombed out of them all because the President is not willing to see any other viable solution to this problem. <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 308<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/2/02 5:02:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Recipe for War...</span><hr size=1> &quot;This isn't about weapons inspections..it's about disarmament&quot;<br>
<br>
The U.S. claims it has absolute proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. However, the UN wants to scrap the last 11 years and start the process all over nice and new (back to the beginning - 91 resolutions).<br>
<br>
Obeying the law:<br>
The existing resolutions are law...law that Iraq has broke time and time again. How many &quot;clean slates&quot; are we going to give him? How many times do you tell a child to clean their room before you act and punish them for disobedience?<br>
<br>
I heard it explained like this:<br>
You have a child whom you suspect has Crack in his room. You have a standing rule in your house &quot;No crack in this house, ever!&quot; Yet the child will not let you search their room... locking and barring the doors.<br>
<br>
You impose sanctions.. You ground them, take away allowance, no TV, no phone, etc, but still he will not let you search his room.<br>
<br>
You tell the child &quot;Crack is illegal..we are calling the police and they will take care of it!&quot;  Under fear of the police the child then agrees to let you search only parts of the room. Closet and dresser are off limits though. <br>
<br>
Is this negotiation acceptable?<br>
<br>
I think that most of us are missing the point all together. Saddam wants weapons of mass destruction. ..he will continue to build them... he will continue to employ them when he can. No, we dont assassinate the child cause he likes his Crack, but we do totally remove his ability to obtain and use it. <p><font color=#FFaa36>

<br>
I have to disagree with you. Firstly, the analogy you use of punishing a child who has done wrong is not fitting. Iraq is not a "wayward child" in need of US "parenting".<br>
<br>
Secondly, UN resolutions only have the teeth the Security council puts into them. What does that mean? It means that if the security council in 1991 had voted to enforce its resolutions with force the world would be kicking Saddam in the a<i></i>ss today. The fact is that the Security Council voted to use sanctions, rather than force.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, Saddam is where he is (weapons and all) due to the blunder of former President Bush. Our military might in the Persian Gulf would have completely dislodged Saddam from power if President Bush (the commander in chief) had the will to use that power to complete the job. Former President Bush lacked the fortitude to commit our troops to urban warfare in Bagdahd.<br>
<br>
Finally, it is the faults of the UN Security Council and the Former Bush administration that puts us where we are at today with Iraq. We can't reasonably see it any other way.<br>
<br>
The solution is <i><b>not</i></b> to wage a new unprovoked war against Iraq. It is put faith in the process of peace that the UN Security council implemented and hope it works. If Saddam does allow inspectors and they find nothing I think the world will be completely relieved and we can all move on to what really matters and that is securing our borders against terror. <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucnjmorris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cnjmorris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/2/02 9:01:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Recipe for War...</span><hr size=1> Its lose lose.  I am glad I don't have to be the one to decide which it the bigger loss.<br>
<br>
Saddam is insane.  He claimed they could beat the US back int he Guilf days and I think he actually believed it.  It was at that point I knew he wasn't working with a full deck.<br>
<br>
So now we are faced with the decision to let him stockpile more and more weapons or try to stop him.  So we attack and he uses chemicals and hides behinds civilians.  Or we don't attack and next time they fly a plane into the sears tower, only this time there was a canister of air born virus in a suitcase that just loved the explosions spreading power.<br>
<br>
You know what... this isn't about Bush, this isn't about Clinton or Bush Sr.  There is no Republican or Democratic... or, there is and shouldn't be.<br>
<br>
This is a time of tought decisions.  Do you have a solution?  Think hard before you say yes.  Think really hard.  You have a solution that will save lives not only now but in the FUTURE.  You have a solution that will protect us not only from Saddam but from the terrorists he is KNOWN to support?<br>
<br>
I don't have the answer.  Should we attack?  I don't know, but I don't know that we shouldn't either.  <br>
<br>
People saying that this is all about Oil... where have you been, what planet has your mind been vacationing on?  Maybe oil is an issue, but to act like its the only motivation... do you think that Bush didn't know anyone who has died to terrorists?  I give him a little more credit than saying this is all about oil prices.  I don't know anyone who died to terorists, I haven't even heard about a friend or an acquaintence dying to one... and yet I feel the powerful need to do SOMETHING.<br>
<br>
Should the US sit and do nothing because it doesn't know what to do?  It may be that war is a mistake, but the bigger crime would be to sit by and watch our children, our fathers, and our heroes be systematically slaughtered by un-named sources, hiding behind pawns who have been promised untold treasures in the afterlife.<br>
<br>
I am not close minded.  I am NOT saying war is the answer.  What I AM saying is that people who do nothing and sit back and criticise, ESPECIALLY those who do it on a political basis, are NOT a part of the solution.<br>
<br>
Why do I get the impression that most of these people would be supportive if some Democrat was sitting in the Whits House under the same exact situation.  All of a sudden war would be an acceptable need, and it would have nothing to do with oil... <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

<br>
You make very sense and stated quite a number of excellent points. Especially the point that we don't have the answers and we should think very hard before we do say we have the solution.<br>
<br>
I believe the Bush administration is giving this little thought from an ethical/moral view. I believe they are giving it considerable thought from a &quot;US Interests&quot; perspective.<br>
<br>
Where I disagree with you is over the point that those who think this issue is just about oil have &quot;vacationing&quot; minds. Truth is Cendan is that many of us who think this is &quot;just about oil&quot; can remember US history well and the intrusions into other countries solely on the basis of oil. One case in point: Tampico Mexico (around 1913) was invaded by US Marines to &quot;liberate&quot; Union Oil from Mexico's decision to incorporate all it's oil resources (in other words the government owned the oil and not private companies).<br>
<br>
US history is rampant with military invasions to soften up countries for corporate interest. So, please give a little more credit to those who are saying this is just about oil. We aren't brain dead imbiciles. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/2/02 10:50:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Recipe for War...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Former President Bush lacked the fortitude to commit our troops to urban warfare in Bagdahd.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are right.. he did indeed. Yet his reasoning was so to adhere to the (then current) U.N. resolutions. Now little Dub has upped the ante.<br>
<br>
There are certain issues and certain types of people that are totally repellent to diplomacy (Re: WWII / Hitler).  The analogy about the child with crack was to make a statement. Saddam has, under current U.N. resolutions, a dangerous &quot;controlled substance&quot;...and a willingness to use it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps our resolves differ. I say: Kick down the door, toss the child aside while you comb his room looking for the contraband. After it is gone and out of his reach, THEN start talking diplomacy. We cannot merely stand on the other side of the door, talking through 1 1/2&quot; of wood telling him its bad, etc... &quot;and hope it works&quot;<br>
<br>
Taking Saddam out has enormous political complications... Oil being one of them. Although I would personally like to see Saddam gone, I feel we need to take care of the immediate business at hand..which is destroying his aggressive WMD arsenal. There is only one way to do this and diplomacy  / inspectors isnt it.. We must seize completely he ability to make war / WMD.<br>

<br>
In my opinion, Former President Bush opted not to go into Bagdhad because the elections were coming up. Should body bags by the dozens of come back from the mideast he would have not stood a chance at re-election.<br>
<br>
It turns out that he was beat to hell anyways! eheheh Point is that Former Bush was ill advised and he opted for easy street rather than the hard road to victory.<br>

I said it isn't ALL about oil.  Is oil a influence on decision?  Maybe it is but my point is that people have said that is what this is about... and my point is simple; where have you been?  Remember planes flying into buildings and innocents dying?  <br>
<br>
You would have a tough, if not impossible, time convincing me that revenge, justice, or other motivations are not involved in the desire to attack.  It can't be all about oil.<br>
<br>
We may never know if Bush wants oil and figures he will get revenge at the same time, or if Bush wants revenge and will get oil at the same time.  In either event, it isn't ALL about oil.  I wouldn't even say it is the major factor.  I will admit that to think it hasn't crossed their mind would be naieve (don't feel like looking up the spelling). <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

Concerning getting "revenge" that is not a convincing point. It wasn't Iraqis that flew the planes on 09/11. They were Saudis. Now why isn't the US kicking the snot out of Saudi Arabia right now, following the revenge idea you present? <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeenmalikyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen MaliKyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/4/02 7:54:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Recipe for War...</span><hr size=1> Sorry for the double posting... didn't quite finish my train of thought, Cendan. :)<br>
<br>
Revenge would be appropriate but only against those directly responsible for 09/11. Those who indirectly gave aid to al Queda should be dealt with, but not with violence.<br>
<br>
The Israel/Palestine conflict has demonstrated that violence does not work at resolving issues from the standpoint of exacting revenge.<br>
<br>
The "WOMD Argument". Is the possession of weapons of mass destruction good enough reason to strike a country first?<br>
<br>
Condsider the number of countries possessing such weapons and the reconsider how many of them hate the USA.<br>
<br>
If we took the same logic of the WOMD Argument and recursively applied it to history, then the USA would be solely responsible for the destruction of the world. We would have attacked France under DeGaul (sp?) in the 60s, since France had ABMs pointing at us. We would have invaded Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Pakistan would certainly have recieved our nukes. Korea and China would have been attacked, too.<br>
<br>
The facts are that we have used diplomacy very successfully against the likes of Stalin, Breshnev (sp?), and Mao to name three. All three of these leaders have used WOMD against their own populations and US intelligence was aware of it.<br>
<br>
Consider that if we used GW Bush's "First Strike" logic in the above situations that either the world would be a burnt cinder by now, or we would still be in a very bloody conventional war.<br>
<br>
So Cendan, I have to ask myself if Bush is thinking at all about this issue, or is there some other reason that Bush wants to go into Iraq? (The idea here is that Bush obviously doesn't want to apply first strike logic to China, Pakistan, India, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.) The only other reason remotely rational is US oil interests.<br>
<br>
Revenge isn't the reason, as demonstrated above, and the WOMD argument fails. What other motivation is there? Oil interests, and the US has attacked countries over Oil before. <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucnjmorris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cnjmorris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/4/02 8:16:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Recipe for War...</span><hr size=1> I think that reaction to possesion of WOMD should be reviewed on a case by case basis.  While you can point to other governements successfully negotiated with, the fact remains that each situation is different.<br>
<br>
Negotiations with Saddam have resulted in half truths, and a constsnt tendency to go back on promises made.  One of the keys to negotiation is resolution.  Why negotiate when the obvious outcome is only more time for a country to prepare to do more of the same?<br>
<br>
Regardless, I didn't say we should attack.  I still know this isn't all about oil.  There are other factors involved.  Is oil the major factor? I haven't stated it is or isn't... but really... is it logical to assume that it is only about oil?  It just isn't given all the things that are involved.<br>

<br>
Negotiations are compromises. The entire process of negotiation is to give each party something they want.<br>
<br>
Iraq wants economic sanctions lifted and the no-fly zones dissolved, I am sure. I am sure the US wants to maintain its presence in Iraq, through the no-fly zones, and is probably viewed as being decietful by Iraqi leaderhsip, too. Again, that is part of the negotiation process.<br>
<br>
Is Saddam presenting half truths? I can't say for sure. All we know is what the US government wants us to know. If Saddam was so deceitful, I would find it hard to believe that both France and Russia would be fighting the use of military force against Iraq. You see, there are other players here and thinking that the "US way" is the only way is a bit short sighted. Indeed, after 9/11 I can't help but think our judgements is being clouded and rushing into war is not ideal. Maybe the French and Russians are right in this case.<br>
<br>
We also have plenty of Democrats and Republicans that <b>disagree</b> with Bush's proposal and believe we need to have full UN Security Council support prior to using military strikes against Iraq to remove Saddam. I am inclined to believe that these people know just as much as the "hawks" at this juncture in the game. So, again, why should we invade? What is the motive here?<br>
<br>
I see it as economic interests plain and simple. If Kuwait had been "Bungfung, Egypt" the US would have cared less. "Bungfung" could have pleaded for US military assistance and we would have ignored them just as we have multitudes of small countries that have been annexed by their larger more powerful neighbors.<br>
<br>
We went into Kuwait for one reason and one reason only: <b>OIL</b>. We are going back into the region for that reason.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I do see your point and accept it. I just disagree on the motivations and wished that our country was doing the morally right thing. I don't see that they are and I am disappointed. <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 535<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/5/02 4:53:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Recipe for War...</span><hr size=1> I'm certain that Saddam IS being decietful, and I suspect that France and Russia believe it too. I think there's deciet involved in any internation diplomatic negotiations of this sort. On both sides.<br>
<br>
Here's a few articles looking at some of the things which concern me:<br>
* <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.nhpeaceaction.org/news/US_Iraq_policy_1.shtml">US Iraq policy hasn't been what you thought it was</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
* Whatever happened to ... <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/1999/05/27/p23s3.htm">US Ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
And a summary of some of those issues:<br>
* An uprising against Saddam by the people of Iraq, called for by alliance leaders towards the end of the Gulf War, received no support, and in fact it looks like implicit support was given to Saddam in putting it down.<br>
* The &quot;Our policy is to get rid of Saddam Hussein, not his regime&quot; quote from a National Security Council staffer.<br>
* Turkish planes bombing Kurds in northern Iraq, where the forces patrolling the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone are explicitly told to return to base so they can't see it happening.<br>
* The sanctions, which have done tremendous harm to the Iraqi people, but if the Blair document is to be believed, have not achieved their stated aim of stopping the development of WoMD.<br>
* Depleted uranium used in the Gulf war is probably responsible for a staggering increase in cancer rates in southern Iraq. Depleted uranium used in Kuwait has been cleared up, but not in Iraq (equipment to even test radiation levels is under sanctions).<br>
* Did April Glaspie give a &quot;green light&quot; to Saddam to invade Kuwait? I doubt it, but maybe she was ambivalent enough that he thought she had done so.<br>
* <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/dec2001/kiss-d19.shtml">US approved 1975 Indonesian invasion of East Timor</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> (relevant to Iraq in light of the previous point)<br>
* Sale of biological weapons material to Iraq in the 80's (licensed by the US Department of Commerce).<br>
* Similarly with other weapons and nuclear reactors, immediately prior to the Gulf war.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A US Department of Energy official discovered that advanced nuclear reactors were being shipped to Iraq.

<br>
You have provided some great documentation and I should hope it is food for thought for others who may frequent this thread.<br>
<br>
One interesting point you make is that there is deciet involved in any diplomatic negotiations. While I am inclined to agree with you, from a realist perspective, I would give careful attention to semantics. I know that is a dirty word amongst some. However, it is usually the foundation upon which most political/diplomatic policies are built.<br>
<br>
Iraq may very well be decieving us, which would be intentionally providing erroneous information for the purpose of hiding something.<br>
<br>
In negotiations, a good negotiater will not put all their cards on the table. However, that is not deciet, since it isn't providing misinformation.<br>
<br>
Another issue is that we know Iraq is providing disinformation regarding their capabilities towards Weapons of Mass Destruction. The question is, in which direction are they leading us?<br>
<br>
When the US developed atomic weapons we only had two, at first. However, our government quite purposely misinformed her allies and allowed to "leak" that we had more than two nukes. Isn't it possible that Iraq may be doing the same thing? Wouldn't be in their interests to allow leaks that they have far greater weapons capabilities than they actually do?<br>
<br>
I think such a move, while slight, is not far out of the realm of reality. It is surely a possibility that would serve them well, since it would cause countries like the US to carefully reconsider invasion.<br>
<br>
Another idea I propose is that the US intelligience agencies know very little about what Iraq's WOMD capabilities are. If the US did have rock solid evidence why not make it public to the world? The US could simply say, "See here Husein, we know that you have such and such in this amount. Time to disarm or pay. Trust us, we will know if you have disarmed or not." I think the US government really has only small clues and are grasping at them frantically in order to justify an invasion to soften up Iraq for US oil interests.<br>
<br>
The counter argument is that if the US does know what their WOMD capabilities are they can't publicly divuldge that information for fear that an intelligence network in the country would be exposed.<br>
<br>
There are several problems with that counter. Namely, if the US wants to prove their case for invasion into Iraq, then they bloody well don't need whatever intelligence network is in Iraq. After all, we will have thousands of troops in country to provide us with intelligence as allied forces clear the streets of Bagdahd.<br>
<br>
Secondly, if we did have that quality of intelligence in the country, then why not use them to take out Saddam? After all, they would have to be pretty close to the inner circle at times to be able to obtain accurate intelligence. This is why I think the US has crap. We don't have good human intelligence about the WOMD Iraq alledgedly posseses. If we did then we would certainly use it to persuade France and Russia. Seeing they aren't persuaded we have yet more evidence that the US hasn't a clear cut case proving Iraqs weapons capabilities. <p><HTML><IMG SRC="http://64.81.30.48/lurisig.jpg" HSPACE="150" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="185" BORDER="0"> </HTML></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 536<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/9/02 8:09:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest Recipe for War...</span><hr size=1> Todays snippets:<br>
