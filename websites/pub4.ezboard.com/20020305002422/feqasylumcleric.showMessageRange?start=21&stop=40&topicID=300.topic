<br>
So, the container is NO DROP but not NO RENT.<br>
<br>
With the full loot being on him, this means farming. Sigh, they improve things only to ruin them again by a couple of bad choices.<br>
<br>
Ok, he spawns faster now, due to the fact he is not linked to Nagafan.<br>
<br>
But with all the facts now available, this change has actually made the quest harder not easier, as at first it looked. First there is the fact there are now TWO things on long spawn timers to camp, not one. Second, we have farmers to contend with. Third, it will STILL end up being an FFA/greed race, and not a triggerable finale like many other epics. And fourth, clerics who are not even at this point in the epic taking these kills from those who are (though I can see 'last piece' being used as a criteria in cleric epic raids now, like in other epics).<br>
<br>
The only other positive points are, firstly, failing on him doesn't mean re-starting the epic, and secondly, the random 1-3 day timer means he will be up more often.<br>
<br>
Sigh. Opportunity lost to actually make the quest more fun and less unpleasent.<br>
<br>
Ho hum. Let's see how it works.<br>

All the others who gain their Shimmering Pearl after this period will very probably find a Zordak &quot;Buy from me&quot; Ragefire up in Sol B.<br>

<br>
In my opinion it had been really easier if they only changed the spawn point of Zordak from Sol B to Skyfire and all other things should be the same. That had prevented that Naggy will conflict the Ragefire spawn and also that the Dragon can be farmed like it is now.<br>
<br>
Also what epic it is now if you can do the final battle at every time in your epic.

<br>
Actually, it's unbearably difficult to get to him at most times of the day in a raiding guild. Being committed to raids basically nightly means you don't have time to sit around in Naggy's lair, and even if you did have a monk on a second computer, the raid force would be out doing other stuff, thus you would be SoL.<br>
<br>
The new change will improve greatly. The container is no drop, this means that any cleric can loot it at any stage of their epic, thus reducing the bottleneck at the very end. Since now you could theoretically start with Ragefire, and end with the pearl. Farming is not and probably will not be that - it will just be a huge debate over who gets the container based on who is closest to actually having their epic.<br>
<br>
It will increase the rate at which epics enter the game, and it will increase your chances of getting an epic. It's also amazingly easier to camp.<br>
<br>
There is virtually no downside to this, save for having every cleric on the server theoretically ready to loot the container.<br>
<br>
Then again, I could always be wrong.<br>

<br>
Dar did bring up a good point about raiding guilds being busy alot of the time, but on the flip hand, SF is very accessible and 2 strong groups can probably take out Ragefire making it very easy for strong guilds to dispatch a small number of people to take out Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Hopefully Verant will make the container no rent.  This would keep only those clerics at that final stage in their quest going after Ragefire and not every other cleric.<br>
<br>
Of course only time will tell what actually happens with this.  At least we will see a slight increase in the number of Ragefire spawns which is about the only good thing Verant actually managed.<br>

How pissed would you be if you just looted it and then went LD... Oopps sorry your screwed!<br>
<br>
Sure having it easy to get now will make it difficult to get for a little while.  But there are only so many clerics...<br>
<br>
I know on most epic pieces they go to the people who are the closest to being finished.  No raid leader is gonna give the container to a person who doesnt already have the other piece unless their are no clerics their with the other piece to combine and finish the quest.<br>
<br>
Everyone needs to realize that this is a benefit not a punishment.<br>
<br>
Sure it will be bottlenecked for a few months but It will clear up and it sure as hell is better than camping RF for 80 hours.<br>
<br>
just my 2 cents... <br>

<br>
Gonna have to disagree with you.<br>
<br>
It's no longer a bottleneck. He spawns more often, and is generally more accessible to everyone.<br>
<br>
There is no more -real- bottleneck to the cleric epic anymore. If you want to call this a bottleneck, it's pretty comparable to the Gimblox camp, and even the Begurgle one. I personally sat in SolA for a combined 9 hours over 3 days till I got my ring. *shrug* It's a lot easier to keep track of, it's a faster, more guaranteed spawn, and it's a helluva lot more accessible.<br>
<br>
There is no downside. And this is going to release the pressure on the old bottleneck, because those clerics with pearls ready right now are going to be the ones most actively camping him, and organizing the raids for him. a_guild_00 isn't going to get a level 50 cleric to loot the container. I think everyone probably knows at least 1 cleric who is at or very close to the Ragefire stage in their epic.<br>
<br>
I fail to see how this is a downside at all, unless you look down the road a few months and see this thing being looted by people as the first piece of their epic.<br>
<br>
The comparison to the red scale or burnt book off Naggy, is a very good one. It's really no more different. There are always an abundance of warriors / bards needing the scale, and there are always an abundance of them leading the raids. You will have no problem finding a cleric to loot the container no matter when you take him down.<br>

<br>
one fault that I find with this reasoning for the loot table is this:  The cleric epic is one of the most &quot;benifical for others&quot; epics out there; I would think that most people would help to get the epic for it's uses if rage droped loot or not.  Furthermore, there are many epic mobs out there that are just as hard if not harder then rage that drops nothing but the epic piece.  I think VI will find having the loot tables still entacted will prolly cause problems <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Also have they posted at all that they have not made ragefire tougher since they changed him?  I would think since the change was also based on the fact that clerics can get more people for thier mobs that he would be buffer now. <p><center><img src="http://students.washington.edu/zip/eq/sig.jpg"></center>

After a long long session online, at after 4am my time, I logged my little level 29 druid in, she is camped at Fire Giants in Sol B. She sees Zordak Ragefire on tracking. OMG!!! Flustered, I camped her, switched to Felishanna (camped in the same spot), and went looking for him. No-one around, totally  uncamped, no FGs up, I wandered everywhere, I can't find him lol (it was just nervousness I think hehe). I switch back to the druid and track him, he is not far away, I just need to use my EYES lol. Felishanna came back on, and hands in one pearl and receives the other.<br>
<br>
It's done. The druid was moved to Skyfire then. The more unpleasent part begins.<br>
<br>
But progress is still nice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But, uninterested, you get up and walk down the steps into the ante chamber directly infront of you. There is a table and a large chair in there. There were two rather mean looking giants in there before, but you and you colleagues had already sent them to the pits of whatever hell they worshipped. You click on the portcullis, and is clanks and clambers its way up for you, and you pass beneath it.<br>
<br>
You look around. To your right is a fissure containing steaming red hot lava, running away into the distance. To your left, the same, except when your eye follows it, you see it bends to the right around a corner. Ahead of you, is a path, that allows you to move only a few steps, then there is a wall of stone, forcing you to turn left down a slope. Move forward, and as you walk down this ramp, the lava running parallel alongside you on the left gets closer, as the ramp gets lower.<br>
<br>
Then you stop, halfway down that ramp as you are descending, and turn to your left. Looking over the fissure, there is a ledge on the other side of the lava-filled divide, partly obscured by the hot and noxious vapours rising from the bright red molten earth. On the ledge, you can make out the figure of a man, in a bright red robe!<br>
<br>
There is that evil missionary you seek. Give him your Shimmering Pearl, and he is forced to release to you the Swirling Pearl, and is thereby driven back to his void.<br>
<br>
(It is easier to describe more accurately coming from the King room; in practice of course, you have no need to go there, nor indeed fight a single giant, as long as you are careful not to get in range of those in the ante chamber, as I did the first time I was wandering around there *smile*).<br>

<br>
Actually no rent is not that bad, the chance of going LD in the 15 secs after you loot the container to combine the pearl with is pretty remote.    It is just an idea to keep clerics at that stage going after him.  Don't no rent items stay with you for a little while if you go LD?  For some reason I thought they changed that.<br>
<br>
I think the what we need to find out is if Ragefire has been buffed up a bit or not.  It would be nice to know what kind of force will be needed now to get him.<br>
<br>
I wonder what will happen to all the cleric monk twinks now? Turn them into SF Ragefire tracking Ranger twinks? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And yes last I checked no-rent items stayed with you for 30min after exiting the world, so unless your computer or ISP or the server or EQ went down for over 30min you would be okay. <p><center><img src="http://students.washington.edu/zip/eq/sig.jpg"></center>

Yes, the chance you will go LD just after looting the container is remote, but it is still there.  Last night, I went to Chardok and went LD at the most inopportune moment.  Then a couple of hours later, I went LD again in Velks.  Then while on a HoT raid, I went LD again.  shortly after coming back online in HoT, I went LD once more.  Normally I don't have these problems, but yesterday was a bad day.  Could happen to any cleric out there and I would hate to see them get so far in the epic and then get fuxored.<br>
<br>
Also, I think they should remove the loot table from Rage.  He only needs to drop the cleric piece.  What is the motivation to help kill the triggered Faydedar?  None, if you are not the druid looting the piece for the epic.  <br>

If you can't find enough people that have the motivation of helping rather then loot, then perhaps you need a new pool of &quot;friends&quot;<br>
