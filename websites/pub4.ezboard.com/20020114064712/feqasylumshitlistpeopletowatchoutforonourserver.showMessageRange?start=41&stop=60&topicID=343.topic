You made a difficult choice, but it was the right one.<br>
Jesy did not see the value in giving up a 5k item for his guilds honor.<br>
<br>
Item's will come and go, but your honor, rep, friends and guild are more important.<br>

<br>
I am editing this post because I wrote what I did here out of anger. No guild should be judged on the actions of only a couple of members. A bad day is sometimes all it takes to have ppl do things they wouldnt do usually. I also didnt go out and went through all the channels I could before coming here, as I should've done.<br>
<br>
So, to UPON, I am sorry for this. I know the matters are being taken care of, and I trust your officers and guildleaders in doing what has to be done. <p><P><p align="center"><IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/favreaumat/kinsig.JPG> <br>

<br>
Although I am the leader of Kits guild I believe this should not be an issue between guilds but rather between players. Therefore, i hope to adress this matter as a concerned member of Lans rather than a representative of our guild.<br>
FIRST  I think that it is imporatant to state the the actions of one individual should not be the source for judgement of a whole guild.  The leaders of any organization should strive to maintain the virtue of the whole by policing the actions of the individuals, but they canot be there every moment.  Although I would not have handled the issue in the same fashoin,  Namin was faced with a very HARD challenge and he did his best.  I was very disappointed to see a tone in the posts that questioned the integrity of UPON.  I have fought along side many members of UPON, they are a very good people both honorable and generous <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I hope that we can all put this behind us and return to the happier parts of EQ.<br>
SECOND  Ive know Kit a long time.  She plays with honor and honesty, and is a great person in general.  Jesy should be ashamed of his actions in this.  He wronged Kit and im glad that his guild took the actions they did.  It works best when we all work together in this great adventure, and it is distreesing to see an individual act as such.  It is interesting to see how many people had bad things to say about their interactions with Jesy.  I think that speaks volumes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
I have retyped what i have in screenshots, and will post any screenshots requested, but because it's a lot, decided to type it up.<br>
<br>
This player:<br>
1) threatened to sue me and write a letter to verant<br>
2) insulted me MANNNNY times<br>
3) harrassed me about duelling him<br>
4) when i declined, spammed me (reported and dealt with by frizznik) and spammed EC with stories of my cowardice<br>
5) created 2 new characters to get past my ignore filter<br>
<br>
Here's what i have in screenshots (like i said, i'm keeping the screenshots for anyone who doubts their authenticity... they're not 100% proof but they're what happened ;D)<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'if it is not removed by the end of the day, I will write a formal statement to verand concerning you'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'I didn't post it, i only moderate the board'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'then remove it 6 hours left'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'you cannot petition me for something that happens off the game silly'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'not that kind of petition you ignorant little girl.'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'have you heard of a lawer?'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'ill introduce you to mine'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, '6 hours left'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'and counting'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'im going to log off now and check the message board.  you'd better get moving.'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'you cant sue me for anything you dork =P'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'you better hurry'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'i didn't post your name on the shitlist =P'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'i merely moderate it ;D'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'you keep thinking that you are responsible for all posts.'<br>
<br>
---------jesy logged for a while----<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, the post is not gone yet.  I sugest you get moving.'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'Ummmm sweetie.  I'm not taking it down.'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, &lt;GRRR lost in screenshot&gt;, ends with 'quit dragin your knuckels and get typen.'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'not only do you have no legal recourse (being posted for doing something bad is NOT slander), i'm not the one that posted you, you have no WAY to sue me, and verant doesn't care what happens off the game.'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'how bout this, how bout you come over here and i beat the tar out of your wana be high level butt'<br>
<br>
You tell Jesy, 'lol um ;D no thanks greeny i'd win and it'd waste my time.'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'you're level 36 sweetie... you wouldn't last at all.  I don't hide behind my guild, i'm telling you upright you're nothing but a waste of time ;D'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'then come on over unless you are afrade of a 35 level'<br>
<br>
[did who all jesy, level 36 =P]<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, ' come on put your fat mouth into action and ask for a port' <br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'you talk alot. but that is all you do.'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'heehee you're pretty funny =D'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'come on over and i'll impruve your looks'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'oooooooooh ;D'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'excuse me i have a post now the screenshots of you backing down from a 35 level you are a coward.'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'LOL imagin that you a 55 level that just took down trak backing down from me.  LOL that will make a great post'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'i'm not backing down from you =P why would i waste your time killing you?  I think i'm gonna exp thanks ;D'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'you do that and while your at it you can add that you are a coward and would not defend your guild.'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'if you're doing the same, read this: i'm level 55, you're level 36.  Not only would i kill you, i'd kill you quickly.  The time spent porting to get you and kill you would be far more than the 20 seconds it would take to destroy you.'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'well come and do it if you are so sure.'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'ill tell ya what i'll pay for the port'<br>
<br>
You told Jesy, 'you don't understand.  I don't want to waste my time ;D what could you POSSIBLY do to me?  hit me for 12 dam once in a while?'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'and when you die ill pay for you to call a cleric to rez LOL'<br>
<br>
You tell Jesy, 'uhhh heehee ok =P i might feign to let you have a few shots... but only out of pity ;D'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you 'you wont defend your guild and you wont defend yourself. that makes you a coward.'<br>
<br>
Jesy tells you, 'you are a spineless little girl.'<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Then came on as 'xxaaiinn' (level 1) and sent me tells about how i was a coward (gave up screenshotting), as well as spamming EC (morganth, frizznik, viren, etc all witnesses) that i am a coward who won't duel jesy. =P<br>
<br>
/ignore xxaaiinn<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
then came on as 'hakanekny' (level 1 warrior) and sent me tells about how i was a coward again =P<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
anyway i logged.  By the way, during all this, I was a) fighting trakanon   b) getting rezzed   c) finishing off tolapmuj and d) helping a guildmate get re-invited  My declining to duel as cowardice... ya right =P<br>

You talked down to JESY like he was some sort of lower life form.  You used the words sweety, dork, silly, greeny, said that he was nothing but a waste of time.  The whole converstion was you talking down to him in a way that would make you show up in the best of light.  I have seen you in action before thats the way you do things.  You act all sweet and nice, but if someone does somthing you do not like, Heavan help them because you go out of your way to get revenge.  It has happened to a few people.  There are a few people who have felt the wrath of Xian, and I for one will never forget it.<br>
<br>
Ok so now for my main points.<br>
1: Xian you are not nice or sweet or even fair. Someday you will slip up and people will find out that you are manipulative, closed minded and power hungry.<br>
2: Back to the best of light statment, you put in there cut off by a screen shot.  Well the part that was cut off was: Jesy said about haveing her remove the post &quot;Perhaps you'll accually become a homo sapien, get of your monkey ass, quit dragging you knuckles and start typeing.&quot;  Lol, I can see why you would not repeat that, xianmonkey - that is insulting.<br>
3: If Jesy is such a waist of time, then why did you spend so much time documenting all of this and then as soon as you log goto the board and happly type up your rant?<br>
4: Oh yaah, this is a good one, umm sweety I was just wondering how someone could do all the things you were doing and still talk with him in tells, take screen shots and contact a gm. Most humans say somthing like fighting or go away.<br>
5: I hope people read this and I hope you get whats coming. I had to suffer from yuor wrath because I was annoying and you did not like me.  You just about raped me of the will for playing eq.  You hurt me and backstabbed me, and all because you did not like me.  But after some time and hiding, I got over it, and I came back to EQ with the mind set it's just a game.  Hey XIAN it's just a game!!!!  If this were real life and someone pulled what Jesy did Or what you do or half the shit on the shit list the would get there ass beat or killed.  But it's JUST A GAME.  Stop trashing people and just learn to ignore and move on.  If you are such an advanced player and so honorable, why do you linger on the falts of others?  Do you need to prey on that to make you more than you are?<br>
<br>
P.S. <br>
I fear what you can do, so I will be completly anonymous.  I will not have you take away my EQ fun again.  I will have the power to say NO! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/unuvassa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nuvas SA</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/13/01 4:20:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: jesy </span><hr size=1> Someone needs to delete lameass2001's post... <p><b>Elidrin Blade'Storm</b>

You committed the wrong, you did so with ill intent and you have no remorse about what you have done. People like you are the primary reason this board exists.<br>
<br>
If you dont like the fact that you are up here, perhaps you should not have done what you did. Granted this is only a game but real people play it and you have to interact with those people every time you play. The game may be virtual but the ill feeling you create is very real.<br>
<br>
So if you are whining about your name being up here remeber that you have done 99% of the work to get it here. The other one percent simply came from the person doing the posting. Your reputation and how people consider is completely in your hands. So if people think you are a theif and scum it because you have to look no further that yourself.<br>
<br>
P.S As a 3 year law student I can also say you would be hard pressed to file suit for anything done over a MMORP, such as EQ, concerning slander unless your real name was listed. While the character Jesy may be registered to a person, Jesy's existance is limited to a virtual scope of a internet game, and therefore does not affect your actual being. You would be lucky if you even found a lawyer who would look at your grievence, much less represented you in a civil suit. So I would suggest that you drop the idle threats, because we all know that you are bluffing.<br>

BTW starting the official pool on how old Jesy really is - im taking the under 14 bet.<br>

<br>
Let me be clear with this.  Talking with you about your shitlist post was not a waste of my time.  You spending more than one hour on 3 different chars challenging me to a duel WAS a waste of my time.<br>
<br>
You didn't come on and say 'hey can we talk about my shitlist post' ... you said 'i understand you're in charge of the shitlist... well if you don't take down my post i will write a letter to verand(sic) etc etc'<br>
<br>
You then challenged me to a duel and spammed me with 3 different characters.  A level 36 (despite your insistance that you were 35... ummm learn your level) bard is a WASTE OF MY TIME duel-wise.  A complete waste.  It would be like a Grade 10 bully challenging Mike Tyson... it would a colossal joke.<br>
<br>
You, at that very point, became a big waste of my time.  Just so everyone knows (and I KNOW i have support on this.)<br>
<br>
I was killing trakanon at the time.  I even shouted in open channels 'LOL someone named jesy is gonna sue me cuz he's in the shitlist'.  So they'll verify that.  After killing trakanon it took us nearly an hour to finish off everything like loot division and kill tolapmuj.  After that we evacced out, and I was helping a guildmate (nippo) get back in. During this WHOLE thing, i was dealing with your lame ass challenging me to a duel.<br>
<br>
You spammed me with tells, i /reported and petitioned, and Frizznik ordered you to talk to me civilly.  I know, cuz Frizznik was the one that told me to take you off ignore.<br>
<br>
You create a level 1 named Xxaaiinn and continued to challenge me.  I ignored that one.<br>
<br>
You created another level 1 named hadenekey or something and continued to mock me from 'fleeing' from your bard =P<br>
<br>
I tried to be fair (and I call EVERYONE sweetie, just so you know, i was not being condescending), and tell you that i can't just take down your post cuz you ask me to, i have to look into it.  You didn't even let me get that out, you threatened to sue me and petition me.<br>
<br>
As to the part where i lost due to screenshot what you said exactly, uhhh... ok?  Ya thats right you called me some gorilla or whatever, the point i was making is you were being an asshole ;D thanks for proving it.<br>
<br>
look bottom line.  You're a coward.  I don't have to accept your duel to defend my honor, because you aren't an insult to it.  Your a tiny wind gusting at a brick wall.<br>

<br>
I am know as Mars in EQ. I am Jesy's wife, in the real world and not in EQ -- I guess I win the poll on how old he is, huh?  Well, I am here to post that I have been an eyewitness to the things that Jesy is accused of.  As far as the EQ regulations go, the Kit girl was in the wrong for farming lore items in the first place.  Since I saw no agreement between my husband and the young lady with the problem, I do not see a problem at all.  I told my husband to contact a GM the day of the incident, and come to find out 2 GM's were on my husband's side.  Kit did not like the actions the GM's took, and seemed to me to be pouting.  Crying over an item is just plan childish.. Like everyone says, &quot;IT IS JUST A GAME!&quot; <br>
<br>
Ok, now second on my list of things I am concerned about...  I was again watching the conversation between my husband and the character &quot;Xian,&quot; and yes is was not a pleasant conversation.  Yes, some of the things my husband said were rude, but also &quot;Xian&quot; was rude in the same manor.  See, that is the thing with some players -- they will rat on other players for the things they do wrong, yet when they do the same they see nothing wrong with it.  <br>
<br>
I have known a few times that &quot;Xian&quot; herself has been on the Shit List and it has been removed or locked so that no replies could be sent in.  I find this disturbing.  I am not saying who is in the right and who is in the wrong.   What I am saying is that I believe this &quot;Shit List&quot; is just a place for everyone to come and spread rumors about one individual and I do not agree.  I left rumors in Grade school -- why can't everyone else leave them there??  <br>
<br>
So please accept my apology because from my perspective I am not here to judge and I am not here to point fingers... I am here to JUST PLAY A GAME !<br>

To me it seems obvious, anyway.<br>
 Regardless whether they are one and the same, and regardless of the age of the involved party(ies), behaviour such as that demostrated only confirms the immaturity of the person(s) involved. Grasping at straws, trying to foist off the blame for immature behaviour on others.....sounds very familiar.......oh yeah, spoiled little brats I have known.......lol.........  ;-)<br>
 I went back and pulled out the blatant mistakes in both posts, not counting the punctuation...results follow.....<br>

(would tend to indicate this is the last significant change of life for this individual, so I would guess the person is in Junior high or High School)<br>
<br>
* one can only assume this should have been &quot;it&quot; not &quot;is&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
 The omitted letters..signs of hurried typing....the lack of proper punctuation and the pattern of those omissions tends to show one person's work. Just thought I'd add my worthless 2cp...since I'm one of the people that sees a world of difference in mildly contemptuous terms such as dork and greeny, and calling someone a condescending Beech. <br>
/sigh  wish there was an emotional age requirement for online activity...then I could totally avoid immature, self-centered, spoiled rotten twits such as this. Good hunting and safe travels to all.<br>
