I had to turn away from the evil lurking in his words. Then i saw a girls gone wild add and it brought happy days to the tv! Not really but its clear to see why things turned out the way they where. You all take the internet thing to freely. People cant reach through your screen and beat the living hell out of you so you take it to your head. There is no reason you cant try to act with decency the best ya can. Your gonna get pissed but its no excuse to start stuff.<br>
<br>
I would like to say as a final point. I blame this entire thread on the misuse of drugs. If your gonna smoke pot do it while listening to music or in a trippy black light room or outside in a corner behind some concrete hideing from the police~ No reason to light up behind the key board because it only makes you retarded k thx.<br>
<br>
Anyways i guess that wasnt my final point because im bored and i have no life at 5:36am so i shall continue. <br>
<br>
Lesson one to joining a elemental guild: Do not tell one of the main warrior's your tired of being patronized that you arnt going to tank at the exact time the mob your supposed to tank is inc and you had already agreed to tank it. Especially with out telling raid and especially make sure your being patronized til you say you are being patronized.<br>
<br>
Lesson two: Do not talk alot about loot and choices made!<br>
<br>
Lesson three: Do not be a gnome and if you are at least have cyberskill(250)<br>
<br>
Lesson four: Eat enrage often when not tanking to make jokes and keep people relaxed comfortable talking  to you<br>
<br>
Lesson five: A robe + mandolin when not a bard or int caster = attention. Even if the words Ru Paul, Will you be my date. And other comments occur. Your getting attention and its nice to know people are trying to accept you and let you fit in.<br>
<br>
Lesson six: Do not argue on worthless boards thinking your a leet supreme being k thx. We all play EQ for fun and cyber. Some more for cyber some more for fun. Get over yourself and just do what you do wherever you are and relax. Popping a vein will not up your hp or make people play better. Been there done that!<br>
<br>
Just to clear any confusion someone might have, most of those dont apply to me but #4 did tonight on a PoE mini rwar i got so pizowned cuz i was talking to another war during fight. Was so caught up in typeing didnt even remember we where fighting a mob /blush just to let you all know i am indeed a gimp also. Cloe you always kinda self ripped on yourself to me so i dont feel bad in using you for this because i mean it in a friendly way and you did really well when you where our only ench at raids. However i am leet blonde like cloe too rwar! Anyways if you all feel you must rip on eachother on your leet haxxor playing skills you got issue. Because mochron im sure zorabel doesnt think your p e n i s is any bigger for trying to talk smack. I am sure she doesnt rip off your clothes giving you mad lubbins for you doing your job on a raid and mezzing some mobs lol.<br>
<br>
Rwar btw the guild leader said i looked, dam i cant remember but i think it was &quot;stunning&quot; in my dress rwar you all never gave me such compliments much bitterness! I wasnt called Ru Paul just could see someone saying it for a joke. Anyways i hope you all are doing ok i talk to alot of you and i know alot of you wish you could be raiding with me still from the tells i get. Keep your chins up and openings will come your way for things youd like to do in future of EQ if you try to stick with it.<br>
<br>
Wish you all the best,<br>
Sildaorf<br>

<br>
I have the guilds most active penis! You know those 2 or 3 times I would take 2 or 3 week &quot;work&quot; vacations from EQ? Those were all bullshit, I was to busy in bed with some hot asian girl I met at the bar the previous night. <br>
<br>
So I would like to appologize to you all for contributing to the guilds demise, but I will make it up to you, I'll go bang another just for you ok, deal?<br>
<br>
On a happy and positive not I just had my Visa renewed for another year, this included getting an STD test, clean clean clean... Oh and I broke my 20th Chinese girl last night.<br>
<br>
Well off to the bar.<br>

<br>
1) Cloe, i like you, but you are just not very good at eq.  You act a lot like my sister in game, she is kind of slow acting and appears ditzy, but shes about to graduate college and is pretty smart irl.  Some people arent just that attentive in eq.<br>
<br>
2) Mochron, i never thought you were very good either, i think you were rather an annoying high-on at times because you would sit there and not do anything for 45 minutes, then get back when we wiped to adds and bitch about it.<br>
<br>
3) Devyn, HI! MISTAKES HAPPEN.  Learn to read, or at least comprehend and understand.  Havent you noticed herb posting under my name before? k? <br>
You always tried to turn sub into something it wasnt.  The reason the guild got as far as it did was a certain group of people.  There was no need to change.  What amazes me is why people join a guild, KNOWING DAMN WELL what the loot system and guild is like, then bitching and trying to change it.<br>
<br>
4) Rhuma, you are a dumbass.  Id wager to bet that you were depressed at the time and couldnt admit it when you went in with cenaris despite everything.  You were the biggest loser ive ever seen, i truely hope your life is better now, but somehow i doubt that it is.  You were in fact infatuated with Cenaris, whethere you want to admit it or not.  You blew up on me when i called her a slut, dont lie bud, its not gonna make you sound &quot;cool&quot; now.  A lot of people got taken by &quot;it.&quot;  Myself included, and yah im ashamed of it and feel stupid but im not gonna deny to try and make myself sound better, and you obviously do, i think you have issues still.<br>
<br>
5) Nurab, you have the biggest ego of anyone ive ever met, it makes me laugh irl.  I'm glad you have sex with random chinese girls, you win the prize irl, no really i care dude.  psst, i dont think youre cool because of it, because you seem to try so hard at it.  I hope you feel good about yourself, because thats all that really matters.<br>
<br>
6) Sildaorf, i act the same way irl as in game, except im a tad more serious, i would say everything that ive said here, to all of yours faces.<br>
<br>
7) and blessing if you see this, no i dont talk behind anyones &quot;back&quot; you dont know me like you think you know everyone.  You condescending ass wipe.  So.. quit trying to spread shit like you have such a knack for, to my friends, k?  <br>
<br>
Anything i say i am prepared to say to there face.<br>
<br>
Now, this doesnt mean i dont like the majority of you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  theres only a few people in sub that i really disliked throughout the duration of being guilded, but of course, i disliked a good portion of you at times which is expected.<br>

Haha, I don't know how to reply to this considering my post was a lil on the sarcastic side. Ah well, its true though, I do have sex with 'not so' random Chinese girls, I'm pretty picky or Id be in my 100's by now. No I dont try so hard, come visit and you will understand. Having a big ego can be fun, in fact if you ever actually met me we would probably get along great, you see I'd rather not cry about shit like so many other people, be positive and you go places... right?<br>
<br>
I feel great, I'm enjoying life, now if someone would show some interest in Furious that would make me that much more happy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
