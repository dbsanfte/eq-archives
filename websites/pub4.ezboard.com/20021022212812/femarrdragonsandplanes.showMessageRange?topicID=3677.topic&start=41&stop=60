I totally hate how people think they can label and define anything they want and that makes it true.  Look at the number of posts that say &quot;THIS is what's punk&quot; and why are we expected to belive it?  Because someone posted it on an EQ messageboard that makes it the truth?  And if you think anything else you're automatically some poser kid trying to fit in!  Oh hell yeah you are!<br>
<br>
It's like this girl that I see around school sometimes.  She started calling me &quot;emo kid&quot; because I had a Get Up Kids shirt on and she does it every time she sees me.  Yesterday I saw her and I had an Ataris shirt on and she said &quot;hey the Ataris suck and they're not punk you know that right?&quot;  Do I care what she thinks?  No, it just gets on my nerves that she thinks her styles and tastes are superior to mine.<br>
<br>
I've never said I was a punk.  I do what I like and I listen to what I like and that just happens to be the category that lots of people stick me in.  I've been the same way I am today for pretty much my entire life.  What used to get me called &quot;wierd&quot; and &quot;silly&quot; is now called &quot;being a punk.&quot;  Some of the bands I like got big, so now I hafta share them with screaming crowds of 13 year old blonde girls.  Big deal, I just don't go to those shows anymore.  They heard it on the radio, I met the band 3 years ago before they had a label.  Does it matter?  Not really, because THEY are still what THEY are and I am still what I am. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/kyliensigz.jpg"></CENTER>

<br>
To say that punk started in the 70's, or that it was based on a sound/band is as false as saying that Elvis Presely started rock &amp; roll.<br>
<br>
Punk as a concept &amp; culture has been around for much longer than there has been a Constitution in the US.<br>

I'm a great fan of Rush and Led Zep.<br>
<br>
I wasn't implying that the Church or XTC were punk, but was lamenting the common need for folk to &quot;dress up&quot; accordingly to be identified with a musical style. I can't talk; I've dressed in all black at times in the past just to get in the mood to stare at my feet that much better =) It just isn't a pre-requisite for the music involved. I'm sure most people understand that.<br>
<br>
Kylien, most of the music you probably like owes a debt to punk. Folk like Iggy and Mr. Lydon made it possible for people like Boy George, Kurt Cobain and your own Gwen Stefani to exist.<br>
<br>
There is little under the sun in modern music that isn't derivative of something that occured in the late 70's or early 80's. <br>
<br>
Call me old-fashioned, but there was something undeniably seductive about the whole post-punk and New Wave scene. <br>
<br>
Being a teenager during this time it naturally left a lifelong impression on me, as I imagine Elvis and Bobby Darin left one on people a generation prior.<br>
<br>
Music makes a great history subject.<br>

Kylien, I think you &amp; I have much similar opinions than is at first readily apparent.<br>
<br>
I think movements like &quot;punk&quot; or whatever do their best to broaden the human experience.  They give us alternative ways of thinking, living, feeling and doing.<br>
<br>
My greatest fear and that of many others is the 'corporate' culture that is growing.  And by corporate culture i'm not just talking about commercialism but more the hive-mindedness.  Corporate culture breeds on our worst tendencies: laziness, need-to-belong, (inter/co/in)dependencies, etc. Everything must be safe, lawful, uninventive, uncontroversial, etc.  Rebellion in any form takes those principles and pees a nice warm stream over the whole mess.<br>
<br>
Viva la resistance!<br>

Punk, In my opinion is a whole bunch of people who could give a flying fvck what people think, care and say about them.<br>
<br>
To call your self &quot;True Punk&quot; and starting a thread about how it pisses you off that people are saying that they're punk is poser.<br>
<br>
If you were a real punk you wouldn't give a fvck what they say, if they wanted to be punk fine. You would have nazis to beat up, girls to fvck and beer to drink, instead of worrying about posers.<br>

Punk as a fashion style... well that is a contradiction. Punk never had style and never was fashionable.<br>

Punk as the self proclaimed representative of "the rebel" against a conformist society? Heheheh, I was a teenager during the late 70s and knew hardcore "Punks". Those who are gainfully employeed today (that I know of) don't remotely look "Punk". <br>
<br>
Really, I don't get why some people today dress punk. That statement is ineffective because the people viewing punks have either been there done that or watched it's hey-day in the 70s.<br>

For me, &quot;punk&quot; was mainly centered around the music. I won't lie and say I didn't &quot;look&quot; punk.  The music was a medium to express the hypocrisy and injustices of society and goverment. The majority of the bands that I listened to (e.g., Crass, Faith, MDC, Dead Kennedys, Bad Religion (when they were interesting), et al.) were didactic.  The composition of the melody was secondary, the message was primary. There were a few bands that were able to balance the two...with the analog technology of the time.<br>
<br>
I never would have imagined a philosophical debate on punk...sitting in my freshman History class in high school (~1983), one of a few classes where I actually showed up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is *not* to say I've been a &quot;punk&quot; longer than you have, so if you were a punk later blah. /bonk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I do see your point about the hypocrisy of BEING punk. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   One day at lunch, towards the end of my freshman year, it did dawn upon me.  I remember it well.  I laughed as I looked around because in our efforts to BE different we were homogenous.  We were a clique that was no different from the kids that played D&amp;D, those who played cards, the stoners, etc. Albeit our way of rebelling was to dye our Ralph Lauren sweaters and rip out Izod logos, etc.  Sounds kinda funny/stupid.  The image of a family without blemishes was *very* important where we were.  Our interest in punk was in the ideals the music expressed - against injustices be it through capitalism, big government, etc. (of course, all while living under our parents' roofs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Anyway, I stopped &quot;looking&quot; punk the following year, after hanging out with my friends in San Francisco (yes, they listened to punk/hc also)...some of their friends were &quot;living the punk life,&quot; as I interpreted it then. Some were squatting, actively participating in rallies, etc.  I felt trivial. Over the years, as I visited with them in SF for the summer, I saw them create families and some die. The glazed over idealism and fighting at every step faded away by the second year of college.  Damn those take-home midterms. *raises fists* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If I had kept up the fight, I am sure in my old age <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would be looked at the same way older '70's activists impressed upon me when I was in high school. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

And here I thought punk was one of the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Those crazy dressed folks I laugh at when I am driving around downtown.<br>
<br>
2) Another name for someone who simply has no respect for anyone but themselves aqnd pretty much thinks only of how something effects themselves.<br>
<br>
3) Someone who gets thier jollys trying to make someone else uncomfortable when we are all really laughing at you.<br>
<br>
4) Someone who flaunts social mores because it draws attention to themselves (see number 2).<br>
<br>
Then again, I could be wrong. <p>Fetch tank, get my exp.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ughiastormwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghia Stormwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/02 9:29:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3677.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What Punk really is .....</span><hr size=1> I think alot of the attitudes you saw in early punk came from a very base belief that we were all going to end up crispy critters from Nuclear bombs.  I personally never expected to see 18....21...30 years of age.  It seriously affected the way we saw the world and how we related to it.  <br>

Yeah I suppose so, but then again you could say that about just about anything.  Oh and for the record I hate No Doubt's music, I just have a giant crush on Gwen and I have for like... uh... since I was like 12 years old.  Ooooohhhhh yeah I have.<br>

What the @#%$ is with those double windmill haymaker motherfuckers?</font><br>
<br>
Actually, I am…errr, was, one of those double windmill haymaker motherfuckers until a second dislocated shoulder at a Hatebreed show blessed me with a sense of mortality I never had. I then realized that it might be time to unclench my fists and watch from the sidelines(though I get tempted, often).<br>
<br>
I’ve been to a few shows many would classify as Punk and even though Hardcore shows look infinitely more abusive with displays put on by the local Straight Edge Kickboxing Team, they aren't. Sure you might catch a fist/foot upside the head, but if you fall there are 5 guys getting you back on your feet before your head touches the floor. Everyone, for the most part, is looking out for everyone else.<br>
<br>
Punk shows, on the other hand, are a total lack of concern and/or respect for everyone else there. Fags come to shows with steel-tipped combat boots and run around kicking at people’s shins then they stage dive feet-first into the crowd. Another thing common in the Punk scene is all that spiked apparel. Spiked rings… spiked bracelets… spiked collars… it’s like they gear up for battle. Punk shows, to me, say, “I'm here to hurt someone… and I brought some accessories to help me.”<br>
<br>
Thanks, but I’ll pass.<br>
