Here is the Story…<br>
<br>
My guild “Legion of Fate” has never stepped on anyone’s toes and we are a growing guild of friends.  We decided to go up to Plane of Air on Saturday Sept. 29th 2001.  Three groups of our guild goes up the night before about 7 hours before to get extra keys so that we could have more than 24 people there, a few of us where there all night to hold the place and let people know that we had the plane.  7am rolls around and people start logging on and we had 15 people up there waiting for the rest to start logging on when a group of Affliction comes up…  We did the standard this Plane is taken and they didn’t care…  At this time the Fairy’s all spawned again so that the rest of our members could come up (which they were in the progress of doing) and get the rest of the keys.  Before anyone knew what was going on the Affliction group started killing one of the Fairy’s.  We said whoa hold on what are you doing? Don’t you see that this plane is taken? No answer… At this time we now have about 28 of our own members in the plane and the group pulls a second Fairy… We asked them to Please stop and lets talk and figure out what was going on… still no reply and they go to pull a third. So we started killing the Fairy’s ourselves.<br>
<br>
After all the Fairy’s were killed and the key giver was spawned we went to give the key parts that we got so we could move to island 2 ahead of them because they gave no response at this point except that they wanted to do what they wanted with out any repercussion.  They then had the audacity to shout we spawn the key giver and you think it is ok that you can get your keys?!  At this point I wanted to shoot myself.  HELLO DID YOU NOT SEE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE AND TELLING YOU THAT THE PLANE WAS TAKEN?  /caps off<br>
<br>
I don’t know what some of you were thinking… I have grouped with a lot of you many times and would have NEVER thought that you would do something like this!  I know when it comes to GREED everyone thinks for themselves but come on some of these people I have known for a long time.<br>
<br>
All in all they came up took over due to strong arming us and moved on without a care in the world…  After picking up my jaw from the floor I had to just camp and write this.  Well I guess things are back to the way they used to be before the WTC destruction and 7,000 people dieing.  NO respect for others and do everything you can to help YOURSELF!  These are selfless deeds and in my book I will now leave any group that these people are in…<br>

<br>
With that all said it still does not fix the fact that I had a lot of my guild up there and we had the place but we were the ones that ended up leaving. <p><img src="http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0NAAlAMcSVOnZKy3eL50tUVzyNwzAERJqUqEvujnob*gBU9a!OTJVGLf1!g5woYO9!uv73qI3e17354XAlnjI7g/Nickoli.jpg" border="0"><br>

If this is the case, wouldn't Landario not sat down and talked to Toran about it? But he did and they talked. When we initially ported up, Landario asked 3 times in say what you were after. But you sat there and stared at us. You were sitting there doing nothing at all. <br>
<br>
As a matter of fact we were taking the LoF people along to get their FA's (I believe that was what they were after?).<br>
<br>
It's a shame that you logged off in a huff, or you might have got the ranger belt that dropped instead of it decaying. -sighs-<br>
<br>
So I'm the worst person there so I get listed twice? Bleh.<br>

<br>
Nickoli i don't know you but that post makes you look like an Idiot. The fact that you refer to the WTC incident is also not very stylish but well.<br>
<br>
As you know, we were gathering in SRO and talked in Say mode about POA and your people were sitting right next to us.<br>
When we asked them if they were also heading to POA they said &quot;No we head to hate&quot; and ported.<br>
<br>
10 mins later i see those same Peoples sitting on the first island in POA doing nothing but watching the Faeries.<br>
<br>
Two officers of us(Stumpf and me) grouped with two officers(?) of your guild and talked with them for about one hour.<br>
<br>
Your members said their main goal is the FA for Toran, so we said we get him up there with us to get his FA. We also said that we only want to get mobs on 4th and 5th island for epics and you guys said you don't need those.<br>
<br>
The problem was that your guild could not agree on anything.<br>
<br>
Your last suggestion was that we have to take a group of your guild along to get exp and all items(dunno which items...guess quest pieces) from island 1 to 4 and that we let you get our next Venril Sathir in the rotation.<br>
<br>
By that time i had talked for more than one hour with you guys and then we decided to just move on.<br>
<br>
Sorry if you got the impression that we are evil Overlords but maybe you should look into the mirror first.<br>
<br>
And again refering to the WTC incident makes you look like a jackass.<br>
<br>
Toran you are a good guy, i told you we take you along to get your FA and that offer still stands.<br>
<br>

<br>
A)  Affliction was in Sro the same time you guys were<br>
B)  NOONE was in Sky.  Including LoF so don't try to fool others.<br>
C)  Affliction ASKED LoF what their plans were.  LoF replied they were going to HATE.  Yes HATE, not Sky.  <br>
D)  Once everyone got up there and started killing faeries and the clusterfuck began, we TRIED to talk with you and work out a reasonable alternative.  We wanted Isle 4 and the KoS.  Nothing else.  You're &quot;suggestion&quot; was to 1) Bring your entire raid force with us.  2) have us Corpse summon/island hop your entire raid to every island we went to 3) Make a stop by Noble Isle to get a monk his epic piece 4) Get 2 people their FA pieces 5) Let your guys get all the kills (for the XP) 6) Let your guys get ALL the loots that dropped aside from a cape if it dropped from KoS 6) Let you guys take our Next VS /boggle.  7) Oh, did I mention island hop all their corpses across every island even though they had 1 necro who can't use small coffins, but, well, they had no coffins at all anyways.<br>
E)  We offered to take your entire raid force with us.  Including Summoning corpses to each island.  You wouldn't accept that.<br>
F)  We offered to take 1 or 2 groups along with us to get your Pallys and Monk their epic pieces.  You wouldn't accept that.<br>
G)  You sat around making demands to us that we could not accept AFTER you had lied to us about your intentions to go up.  We had our force there ready to move/fight.  We offered solutions that were more than fair yet you would not accept them.  So, we moved on to our goals.<br>
<br>
Yea, well, then the whole fuckup thing with Sirran on 3rd Island.  One of our Genius' forgot not to use /say around Sirran and despawned him before everyone got keys or even 1 necro that could get corpses to the next island.  That screwed everything for everyone there.  So, we left, disappointed at the entire thing.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I will admit it was a hugely clusterfucked ordeal.  However, before you come off claiming all the &quot;bad people&quot; of affliction or the &quot;disrespectfuls&quot; please do us all a favor and tell things fully for what they are worth. <br>
<br>

<br>
1) We were in Sro at the same time, we said we were going to sky, you said you were going to hate (assuming that was said to mislead us). (Lie!)<br>
<br>
2) I was told that unless we helped your monk get his epic stuff from isle 2, you guys were going to be claiming the plane (Lie &amp; blackmail attempt!)<br>
<br>
3) You guys tried to say in game and again in your post that you had a couple groups of people up there hours before us.. we ported up SECONDS after you, there was NO ONE ELSE in Sky and all the first isle mobs were up. (More lies!)<br>
<br>
4) We offered to leave Dojorn isle keys on corpses and take your pally up to finish his FA, even though you guys lied to us (repeatedly) and tried to blackmail us. You said you wanted to send more groups up (including one xp group!), and wanted our next spot on the VS rotation (wtf?).<br>
<br>
5) You tied in the WTC with some game-oriented rant, in which your &quot;facts&quot; are entirely fabricated and/or laughable? What the fuck is going on in your head?? <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> At this time we now have about 28 of our own members in the plane and the group pulls a second Fairy… All in all they came up took over due to strong arming us and moved on without a care in the world<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hi, I'm going to take a wild guess here and say we had MORE people than you in the plane and that we made SEVERAL offers to be nice, all of which you guys couldn't accept but had to add your own demands on top of.

Oh, and there were a group of LoF in Sky much earlier today. Don't know if they stayed to the time you guys mention. However, it would seem logical to stay up there waiting for keys doesn't it? <p><HTML><CENTER>

One guild can't claim the whole plane because it supports two if they are on different islands. When SF still went to sky, we routinely had either a guild behind us or a guild in front of us on the islands. Get used to it and you will find you need less heartburn meds.<br>
<br>
Secondly, if you started tossing demands like that out, I probably would have told you to go take a flying leap off the damn island. I see no fault in what Aff did, and if you plan on leading raids you should start working on your negotiation skills or you can probably expect to have this repeated a lot.<br>

<br>
The lack of respect either guild had for the other has nothing to do with the respect centered around the loss of human lives. Don't even put that in the same thread. <p><FONT COLOR=purple>~<b><i>Khael Incantare</i></b></FONT><br><FONT COLOR=silver><i>Proud Officer of Affliction</i></FONT></b></FONT><br><FONT COLOR=silver><i>Sorcerer of Erollisi Marr</i></FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufaiithmysticserenity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faiith Mysticserenity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/29/01 12:35:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What were you thinking Affliction?</span><hr size=1> First of all, the comment made about WTC is NOT what should be focused on...Nickoli was merely pointing out the fact that it's wonderful when people stand together and respect eachother, and the way our guild was treated does not show this type of behavior. GET OVER IT and don't make his comment into something it's not.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't know who told you we were going to Hate, can we have some names please? Anyways, there was no &quot;conspiracy&quot; to mislead you that we were going to Hate...that's a pretty lame assumption.<br>
<br>
Third, you all seemed to miss the whole point of Nickoli's post. I know it's fun to totally trash someone to make you feel better, or if you are just malicious in intent, I don't know...but maybe I can clear up his complaint.<br>
<br>
Friday night a few of us had gone up to PoA to acquire keys because we don't have the means to buy them for everyone, simple enough. Saturday morning we all gathered in the PoA, as well as some people who still needed to get their keys who had not yet looted the components. Gargore, a Legion of Fate member was the first one online in the PoA, followed very shortly by other members of LoF. Meanwhile, other members of our guild awaited TP's from our wizard (so yes, Affliction DID see people at the spire, but that does not mean they were first to tp into PoA because we DID have people already up there). Let me stop right there...<br>
<br>
At that particular time, Affliction should have backed off, we had been there, we already had keys, why shouldn't the plane be ours? If you all were mislead thinking we were going to Hate, I apologize, and would have gladly reimbursed your money for the stone, but for that first (and only) group to arrive in PoA when we were there to not discuss the situation and disregard us, that was just rude to start killing the fairies. Only after you had killed 2 fairies did I see any attempt to discuss the situation with Toran. Kelewala had tried to talk to you before, but was disregarded. <br>
<br>
Under the circumstances, it was nice of you to offer to help Toran with his quest piece...but what about the fact that we were there first and should have had the plane anyways?<br>
<br>
I don't want this situation to be blown out of proportion, and I don't want to fight like a bunch of infants, name calling and just being plain stupid. Let's fix this and get on with the game (oh yeah, it IS a game...). Nickoli is a good person. I'm sure he was very upset and disappointed when he posted his comment, but lets work this out.<br>

<br>
Tachyr... RoFL you are funny... The reference I had to the WTC is none other than it WAS a changing point in ALL our lives, and that people started feeling more proud to be American by HELPING each other in the fact that people accross the nation would give money blood what have you to help those in need! Pick it apart how you like and call me what you will it only shows what age you really are...<br>
<br>
The problem with big raids is that the guild chat flys by and no one really knows what is going on cause no one is telling us...  You came up they all annouced it guildchat that you were there and Toran said he would handle it and for no one to say anything to you all. I told my story out of what I witnessed and I was ther last night and early this morning... If I need to log the time that I log in evertime I go to a raid just to prove a statement then that is what I must do...<br>
<br>
Another thing, if you say &quot;a&quot; group usually meaning one at the bottom of S Ro how does that explain the 15 that we had up there by the time that you came in? we were there in numbers and you can't tell me NO ONE was up there cause there was!<br>
<br>
The whole point to this is that we were there FIRST! You think you can justify it by now offering us one of the many pieces that we needed up there? NO! LoF was up there to get many items from PoA and it was a Guild raid. We didn't need you to hold our hand by you taking us to only one of the places we need. Like you said you talked to 2 officers that were up there and yes the MAIN reason was for Toran's Epic piece (which you so nicely offered to help us get and that is it). Well I don't know how things are in Affliction but when LoF goes on a raid we tend to try to get things for all who attend (keeps people happy).<br>
<br>
My post was not to call anyone names nor tell them how messed up in the head they are or to go play in a sand box like I am better than them, it was simply a post to show how one guild came in and strong armed another... We were there first!<br>
<br>
I feel bad that a Ranger did not get that belt however I do not need it cause I have my Epics... Thank you for the concern though. I am sure one of our other Rangers would have loved to have it but it dropped on island 2 after you jumped ahead of us so were we supposed to just folow you around and pick up what you don't need?<br>
<br>
Oh and one more thing... who cares if I misspell things? I am trying to make a point and if I misspell words that means I am human...<br>
<br>
