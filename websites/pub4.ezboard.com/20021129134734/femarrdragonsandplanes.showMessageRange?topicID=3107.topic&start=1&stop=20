That article above tells us that Shrub(Bush Jr.) is pushing to change the law<br>
from making the companies that pollute pay for the cleanups, to making US<br>
pay for the cleanups. Further, he intends to take the Superfund, and use it<br>
to featherbed. Considering that 25% of the USA citizens all live within one mile<br>
of a superfund site, that means that it DOES affect you. Like it or not.<br>
<br>
Frankly I think that is outrageous, making the victims pay for the cleanup.<br>
But it is your world that you will inherit. So I genuinely hope that you will<br>
at least think about this issue.<br>

But, anyway, I've always been of the belief that if YOU make a mess, then YOU should clean it up.  Now, if this passes the Legislature, the corporate fat cats are now LESS responsible for their mess, giving them LESS incentive NOT to pollute.

<br>
The reason i brought up the fact of paying for the poors shelter ect is because GOVT , has people paying for others all the time .. In this case of the time article its going to be tax payers paying for the Rich Corporate clean up ... and in the case of the poor , the tax payers paying for their shelter food ect .. <br>
<br>
Its a example of how Govt no matter what political side does things stupid like this.. <br>

How's this stat for you-All our social programs combined from Aid to families with dependent childeren to school lunches to housing assistance amounts to 50 billion a year. That's roughly $415 a year from each person. $1.14 a day.  However each year corporations take nearly 170 billion in federal tax funded federal handouts. That's $1388 a year from each tax payer going to pay. Over three times the money &quot;wasted&quot; on welfare programs is dumped into CEO's laps to do with however they choose, and that stat was from '96 when there was a democrat in office.<br>
<br>
The average person who goes on welfare is on welfare two years total. They usually want to work. The welfare system was created to help people rise up from poverty, and I think it is a true testament to the vision the founders of America had. That America is a land of oppurtunity. The average welfare recepient will pay more in taxes than they ever took out. I wonder did Enron pay more in taxes than we are going to spend on there trial and on the unemployment we will have to pay there workers. Not to mentions all the perks and kickbacks Enron probably got as they had freinds in high places.Did the banks involved in the savings and loan scandal pay more than we paid to bail there ass out? <br>
<br>
BULLSHIT this is anything like welfare, this is the rich taking advantage of power. Welfare is the poor struggling to make something of themselves. The world once ran where the rich did not have to kickback anything to the poor, it is called feudalism. America was founded on the beliefs that wealth was something one worked for. The poor don't become wealthy off of welfare, but the rich become untoppleable when they are allowed to use there money to govern. <br>

To me each of these things are wrong .. I shouldnt have to pay my money to bail out the poor , or to give breaks to the rich corporations.. that said to me they are two sides of the same coin.. yes the corporation is the bigger heavier side , but nonetheless , the same thing to me .. <br>
<br>
On the thought that welfare is people struggling to make something out of themselves , I sure as heck dont see that living in Atlanta ... I see the people on welfare staying there and not trying to get jobs ect .. i am sure some do use it to get back on the track that they want to be on ..

<br>
I am a Voltairien. A believer in the humanity, in the human kind. With his low and his high points.<br>
<br>
There are poor people. There was and there will be. Poorness, unemployement, living in the street IS NOT something you choose to do. Sure, there are a small percentage of people who like to live like that, but think a bit and you will agree with me that this is not a life to live like that.<br>
<br>
The same goes for people leaving with the help of welfare association or programm. Do you realy think that the majority of those people like to live like that?? Being told what to do, to look for a job, to beg for some money to feed the kids... Human being hate to beg. Again, a small percentage like that and take advantage of the system.<br>
<br>
History has a lot of exemples that welfare is a need for society. Capitalism and economy know that there will always be some part of the population who will need help from the society to live. This is a result of every economic-politic system. Even communism in his paradisiac form, the on we we will never see due to the human factor, would have those "poor souls". They can be monetary impaired, physicaly inadapted, mentally insufficient, etc. they will exist in every type of society.<br>
<br>
The rich HAVE to pay for the poor. In a way or in another. You, american people more than anyone else, leave by the christian principle. Those principle (which are good for some, but do not enter in this subject PLEASE) lead the human to think to his brother. To care of his akind.<br>
<br>
Love it or hate it, rich people rule the world. Those same people knows that if they let the poor ones thinks too much, they are in danger of a revolution and they DONT want that. Welfare will continue to exist for the sake of our society. Rich will continue to pay for the poor, just to be sure thay are still in the camp of the rich.<br>
<br>
Sad vision of the world, but, halas, true one. I dont like what I just explained, and I try to fight it in my own little way. Sure, I am realy happy to not be in the "poor" camp. Sure I am not a revolutionnary (teenage dreams wear off not so long ago), but I believe in humanity and I hope we can help our children to change for a better. <p><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief//nosfy01.jpg"><BR>Officer of The Phoenix Crusaders - Guild of Erollisi

One day you may break your leg and be unable to work for an extended period of time. In that time you will be happy for the welfare money you get.<br>

By they way before anyone starts telling me how they have insurance, any insurance policy will pay a percentage of your wages minus the state welfare, which they expect you to claim, adn you will because typically you get about half your normal salary. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

Well said my Swiss friend. We here in America tend to villify that which does not have a voice. When our countries figures for debt come up this year it will be environment, and social services which will inevetibly take the blame for our deficit. I'd gladly pay twice the price of the missiles we chuck by the dozens into the sand in the middle east to see a condor fly over head or a young woman leave an abusive marriage without fear of not having shelter or food for her infant daughter. The welfare system will never be totally destroyed. The big corporations want to villify it here in America to push towards there modified version called work-fare. They do it in Wisconsin. It is modern day indentured servitude. Big Business can hire these people at low wages and get a tax break for it. These people then get a gov't kickback. Then instead of hiring full time help they can lay-off these temporary employees and rehire from the pool. Another program similar is the new prison work programs. Companies can hire prisoners at twenty cents an hour to do work for them. Calling to make plane reservations, you may be talking to a rapist. In my opinion those jobs should go to qualified workers and they should get full pay.<br>

1 in every 4 Americans lives near a Superfund site?  That's possible.  Do you realize how trivial most Superfund sites are?  We aren't talking about big holes full of nuclear waste.<br>
<br>
The Superfund is not the way that most toxic waste spills, etc. get cleaned up.  There is a federal statute called CERCLA that is used to make the polluter and other responsible parties pay for the clean up.  The Superfund is a fairly small part of the cleanup process.  It is used when someone else cannot be compelled to pay for the cleanup (for example, because the polluter went bankrupt or disappeared), and the cleanup must be performed by the government.<br>
<br>
The Democrats are pessimistic about stopping this.  Hmm.  The Democrats control the Senate at the moment.  That must mean that this has *gasp* bipartisan support.<br>
<br>
Frankly, the article doesn't contain enough information to allow anyone to make an informed judgment about what Bush is proposing.  Whoever wrote the article for Time is certainly against it, but only fools let the media do their thinking for them. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

<br>
Ellie you must have noticed by now that I say things in a certain way to get<br>
attention. This issue is BIGGER that that, we dont have time to sort thru<br>
what I really mean. So I am just flat out telling you. <br>
<br>
Before 1972 when the EPA was established there were little or NO regs on industrial<br>
waste. Industry did NOT regulate itself in any way. They just moved if the heat<br>
from the locals was too much. It was cheaper to move that to clean it up.<br>
<br>
The whole idea of the super fund was to make it expensive NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE. The locals were no longer the primary irritant. That way the companies<br>
could not economically blackmail a community into silence.<br>
<br>
Sure I dont like Republicans but I hardly hate Bush. I dont even know the man.<br>
So far every bill I have liked he has passed.  He has ALSO passed alot of bills<br>
that I didnt like. But he didnt do that alone. <br>
<br>
I used to work for Toro. In Windom MN. The public dump there is a superfund site.<br>
Because TORO dumped all that pretty green paint that they like on their lawnmowers into the site. It leaked into the ground water and started killing livestock. TORO was forced to pay for it by the EPA. Picking up and moving <br>
away from Windom would not have allowed them to escape. The cost was horrendous. The site is now certified as 'stable' (whatever the hell that is)<br>
<br>
Without the Superfund that would not have happened. Toro has EASY 11 major<br>
plants all over the USA. They would have just closed down the one in Windom<br>
and shifted production. That type of thing is what I am fighting here.<br>
<br>
So no I dont hate Shrub, I just think he is an idiot. The distinction is important.<br>
I DID hate Nixon.  My tag line is for ME not this issue.<br>

Wrong.  The Superfund didn't pay for it.  Toro did.  Bush's proposal would not shift the cost of this kind of cleanup to the taxpayers. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

Fine have it your way, just to clarify - you ARE in favor of having the victim pay<br>
for being the victim? Can you at least give us YOUR stance. Without ambiguity?<br>
