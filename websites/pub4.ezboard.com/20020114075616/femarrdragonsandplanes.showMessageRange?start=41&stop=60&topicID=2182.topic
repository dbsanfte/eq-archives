Far be it from me to say that all casters are farmers and bad people.  I would never try to say that.  What I will agree with however is that caster and intelligence gear is very common.  Tank gear is very rare, at least the high end stuff that you have to have to survive.  The whole fungi tunic- BC argument is based on the fact that there is no real comparable drop that I can work to get a fungi tunic effect.  Where the Bonecaster has become about as common as a Oracle, and thus the price has dropped, and their are comparable robes that are fairly easy to get.  This is what makes open lewt seem insane to me..becuase if I spend 6 hours pulling fungi, and dieing multiple times and doing CR why should I have to random against anyone who cannot use the robe just so they can sell it in EC at an outragoues price.  Where as if they wanted to pick up a BC robe..its chump change..and I would not even be randoming against them for the basic fact that its just wrong to gank an item like that when someone who really needs it is standing right there!<br>
<br>
If i work D1..and a BC drops and a chanter is there wearing an Oracle...its going to him.  Plain and Simple.  Im just asking for the same respect when I work Fungi and a FT drops..but what I see more often than not is..&quot;Hey we all gonna random on that..?...its worth a lot! I could seriously upgrade my gear D00D!&quot;....Thats the whole basis of my argument.  NBG seems to work well for some people some of the time..until they get the greed bug and their brains turn to mush.  This is what I have a problem with and this is what the original poster is struggling with I believe.  The only thing you can and should do is say &quot;grats man..you need it..you get it&quot;.  <br>

I think this pent up anger towards NBG comes from months of casters watching tanks abuse the &quot;player&quot; enforced rule.<br>
<br>
Although this may come to little comfort I just wanted to say that you will get what you need, patience grasshopper.  Find yourself a good guild and your equipment needs will be cared for!<br>
<br>
What all you pro-need before greed people need to understand is that getting the casters equiped is important.  You have a chanter/cleric/druid/shaman with low AC and low mana means less buffs, heals and mezzes.  A weapon that gives a tank 2 more damage could be sold by the caster to buy him a new peice of armor that increases a stat that may be helpful to the needs of a group.  The whole &quot;need&quot; concept is over done and abused by alot of ppl and they hide behind it.  <br>
<br>
I personally find it confuseing as to why people are forced to follow a player enforced rule.  Maybe I am an anarchist or a rebel but who are &quot;you&quot; to tell us whats fair and whats not?  And even worse to make us live by your rules...I dont remember getting to vote on this, I have been playing for over 2 years <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sometimes rules need adjusting...for example back in the day it was legal (I think in Arkansas) to beat your wife on the court steps with a stick no bigger then your thumb before 8 pm.  Maybe back then they had a reason for this but its changed since then.  The rule seems silly.  I think a reveiw of current loot policy is in order and perhaps its time to start thinking of a rule that pleases all, oh and we should also think of setting in place a rule that beating dorfs with a stick no bigger then an ogres leg before 10pm EQ time is legal.... <p>Trilok Izgawd<br>

Ok here it is plain, simple, and harsh.   Honor.  Thats it.  You either have it or you don't.  if you insist on living by open lewt rules and everyone agrees then fine.  If you want NBG, and have the honor to make it work...fine too.  For all of you who bitch about how tired you are of &quot;NBG Abuse&quot;..tough shit..you grouped with people who lacked the honor to make it work..or YOU yourself lacked the honor to see the real value in it.  Bitching cause you are a caster and you couldn't roll on a tank item?  Go to another camp..its not rocket science folks...bitching cause you are a tank and you couldd't roll on caster gear...you are the scum and reason why NBG was created in the first place was becuase of people like you in open loot groups.<br>
<br>
And as far as NBG being a player/tank enforced policy..I'm laffing my ass off at that one.  Where in the License agreement does it say that?  It doesnt..it just happended enough people..casters and tanks alike got sick of low life loot hogs with zero honor screaming to loot items they had ZERO..yes ZERO need for.  You wanna sell it? BFD go take up a trade hobby and make some plat that way..Christ some of you guys make me wonder if you are the asses I see on the streets with the pockets full of gold watches and shit you wanna see me for &quot;cheap&quot; cause you ganked em from someone instead of working hard for em..<br>

I've camped the King spawn many times, and have never asked to be included on the roll for a fungi tunic.  I'll always step aside for a monk or a shaman or some other tank who has a legitimate claim for need.  I'm not willing to abandon NBG just because some shamans and monks make a fortune selling fungi tunics in EC.<br>
<br>
As for your second post, I'd be more impressed by the &quot;honor&quot; argument if it was a two-way street.  But it isn't.  We're almost always talking about melee items.  As other people have pointed out, there are few caster items in zones like KC and OS and the like, and meleers just won't go to camps and zones that drop mostly caster gear.  Where's the honor?<br>
<br>
If you want to make a lot of friends among casters, start putting together some reets and juggs groups.  The conventional wisdom is that reets and juggs can be done by one group in the high 50s or two groups in the mid 50s.  What is the major loot drop?  Spells.  You may drool over a fungi tunic, but I drool just as much over level 56+ spells.  When I've tried to get reets and juggs groups going, I've gotten one of two responses from the meleers: (1) &quot;No, that's boring, let's go to Bar/Chef or King,&quot; or (2) &quot;Okay, but everyone gets to roll on the spells.&quot;<br>
<br>
So if you and the other meleers start feeling honorable, just drop me a tell.  I'll join a reets and juggs group anytime.  I'm not going to hold my breath, though.  Most of the groups that camp reets and juggs groups are guild groups, in which the tanks get an indirect benefit because their guildmates are getting the spells.<br>
<br>
Lell, I'm not going to put down druid healers, because I've grouped with some excellent ones.  Nor am I going to deny that Symbol makes my job easier when it comes to tanks.  When I can cast CH on a fully buffed tank, my mana efficiency is excellent, and I'm much more effective than a druid or shaman.  However, enchanters are a different ballgame.  I don't cast CH on enchanters, because they would usually be dead by the end of the 10 second cast time.  Instead, I use fast casting heals, which are similar to the spells used by druids and shamans.  That is why druids and shamans do a good job when it comes to healing enchanters -- we're all using the same kind of spells.<br>
<br>
The importance of casting Symbol on an enchanter has nothing to do with mana efficiency.  The extra 700 HPs from Marzin will often be the difference between life and death for both the enchanter and the party.  For that reason, most clerics will cast Symbol on the enchanter first, followed by the puller.  This is a matter of survival, not convenience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umorphiusthejeweller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorphiusTheJeweller</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/01 8:45:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> Robles - Your story represents exactly what is wrong with NBG.  SBC is by no means &quot;top end&quot; haste item.  So if you obtained a CoF today, you would have a SBC available to sell/trade.  Going by your story, you would offer your SBC up if you won the CoF, and I admire that, but can you see that many people wouldn't do that.  It would just end up in EC or on Emarr board.<br>
<br>
Ramierez - If groups are just for getting XP, then tanks shouldn't care if loot is randomed to all, right ??  Or is it that tanks just want to use NBG to get free armor (which they can use for a couple levels and then upgrade to SoV quest armor).<br>
<br>
INT casters and monks got kind of hosed with Kunark.  Other classes got a whole line of armor that only they could wear, therefore, NBG was used for these classes to get free armor.  When an INT item dropped, I had to compete against all the other INT casters.  When a low weight armor item dropped, monks had to compete against all the other tanks to get it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueugien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eugien</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/01 8:58:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> how does NBG justify a 55 th level cleric running around in full ro armor TO THIS DAY ?   <br>
<br>
sorry I have sat here and watched this thread go on and on and on<br>
<br>
Things that seem to be overlooked so far in the number of posts is that alot of the items that are put in a NBG category are that way because someone in the group deemed it neccessary for that to happen.. I personally have no problems grouping nbg because I get what I want .. I go out and earn the cash and just fookin buy it, if I am in a non nbg group .. whatever<br>
<br>
its been that way since the dawn of the damn server, people are out for number one , if nbg benefits them then they are all for it.. if not they want the 'pharm' rules. <br>
<br>
the only time I see NBG being a workable option in any group and I fully endorse it .. is when I am grouped my friends  IG and IRL .. <br>
<br>
otherwise it is just another way of fucking half the party .. <br>
<br>
I personally thing this entire argument is fucking retarded .. because the only reason it continues to go one is because you like to argue.<br>
<br>
let me point someting out.<br>
<br>
Cat people are the only people that argue against dogs, dog people do not argue endoresements of dogs because they know that they have nothing they have to prove.  Dogs come when you call them, they are always ready for affection and give it willingly and without question.  Cat people argue that dogs are sluts and that cats are above that.  why? why would anyone want a pet that thinks is superior to its owner? why would you have a pet that would rather shit in a box and  tear up your furniture rather than play in a park with you.<br>
<br>
pointless arguement right?  exactly.  just like this discussion over NBG <br>
<br>
I am in the random for whatever drops or I leave. simple. there are other groups, other things I can do.. I can solo effectively .. I dont need your imposed rules that if a spider fur collar drops .. the warrior gets is just because.  bullshit.<br>

<br>
I got it in a pick up group, I never complain about loot.. I have shit armor, I have shit weapons.. I dont care I play the game to have fun and goof off during my down time at the house.  I dont play to 'win' I dont play to 'be popular' .. I just play.. <br>
<br>
NBG groups seem to focus on the 'honor' or the 'pride' in which people seem to think there is in giving to others.  if it were that big an issue people would give things away all the time.  <br>
<br>
if Verant had never patched in the message about what is looted this thread would not exist and people would be bitching about being speed looted in naggys lair again for the CoF or whatever the hell people are getting speed looted on these days<br>
<br>
the question of honor never comes into play.. explain how honor has anything to do with pulling for a group and dying and someone else getting something while you wait for a res ?<br>
<br>
is the person who got the purple armor less honorable because they came to hate to get the armor while you died selflessly for it? do you expect thanks for doing such?  <br>
<br>
the point of the argument at hand has nothing to do with honor.<br>
<br>
the point of the argument is that people are greedy or they are not .. simple equation.<br>
<br>
I am not a lootwhore.  I was in my early days, but learned that its much more fun to just play the game and advance to get spells. which is why my armor lacks.. save for the few nice peices granted by my friends, who know they are thanked and know that I would do the same for them.<br>
<br>
how does that make me evil for not endorsing the NBG way of play?<br>
<br>
I do not belive that just because I do not have an elder spiritist breastplate and Trak drops that I deserve it because I wear Brown Chitin and everyone else has something else .. I believe that they had an active part in taking Trak down .. and they fully deserve a shot at the items available.  <br>
<br>
its not 'fair' that Eugien get the breastplate just because he is wearing a BCP ..  no because other people there may or may not be more deserving . .but they too worked to get to the loot point of the fight.<br>
<br>
I would step aside to let a guildmate have it in a heart beat because these are my friends.. but a total stranger who I will prolly never group again.  I am in that roll.<br>
<br>
please note Trak as an example as a highly prized druidic drop type of situation .. meant to prove a point, nothing more.<br>
<br>
my point is .. need before greed serves no one, makes for hard feelings when someone walks away from a 6 hour long fighting at the end of the night with 40pp lining his pocket and xp when he was there fighting the whole time and nothing for his class dropped .. but jimbo over there got two items for his class.. nice.<br>
<br>
I am all about playing nice and getting along, but when I group I group for xp and cash.  thats it, I dont want your loot, unless it furthers my tailoring ( ie velks ) and I will split that evenly with whoever else wants it, people concentrate too much on STUFF and not the game.  stuff is economics, this is about personal politics.  <br>

I am not in a dragon killing guild. I am not in vox/nag level range. So yes. This is a &quot;top end&quot; haste item for me and for most. CoF is dropped on RAIDs. I think the point of this thread is how the NBG system works in day to day exp groups. Totally different IMO because when I was able to raid dragons these loot rules were always detailed before the raid even started. You knew how it was going to be before the kill was made.<br>
<br>
And by your theory of a &quot;Future&quot; upgrade. Then NOTHING should ever be NBG'd on. Ultimatley EVERY item in the game is eventually upgradeable. You make it sound like CoF's drop off trees?<br>

I, for one, do my best to keep the enchie healed first whenever I'm the only healer in a group.  The reason?  If you die, everyone will die.  You keep things mezzed.  You keep things slowed.  I don't die.  I don't have big-time HP buffs.  I have good DS's, I have some Skins, I have chloroplast.  The rest is straight healing.  In a group where I'm the only healer, Enchie is my best friend.<br>
<br>
If I'm in a group where there is a cleric, I keep the cleric and enchie healed.  I can do this because 9 times out of 10, the cleric pops a heal on a tank, the cleric starts getting beat up.  So, I keep the cleric healed, so he can keep on healing.  Chances are, enchie gets beat up while trying to mez a resistant mob.  I keep enchie healed to keep mobs mezzed.  Simple math to me.<br>
<br>
Off the subject, I know.  And while there are times when NBG IS a good thing, sometimes it does suck.  People think that druids are rich for ports and whatnot.  Not me.  I hardly ever charge anyone for an evac or a TP.  The only time I make money is if someone puts it up in the trade window.  I don't sit around saying &quot;porting for donations&quot;.  Point?  I'm poor.  Sure, getting a Fungi Tunic and auctioning it in EC could make me a buttload of money.  But if there's someone in the group who really needs it, they have first dibs.  Now, if they want it for their twink, or whatever, oh no.... I have just as much right to it as they do.<br>
<br>
Rolling for spells?  Come on.  If the character you are playing at the moment we kill a mob that drops a spell is NOT able to use the spell, what right do you have to it?  If I already have the spell, I pass on it.  If you want it, it's yours.  But, if it's a spell I don't have, GIMME!  <br>

Can it be any simpler?<br>

<br>
About the Genni thing in the Temple of Sol Ro.  Genni is not a merchant, to get the Fire Opals you need to &quot;Quest&quot; for them.  All you do is hand 550 gold pieces (though she takes 55pp as well) to her and recieve a Fire Opal in return.  Open a Trade Window and put 55pp into the window and get a Fire Opal in return.<br>
<br>
As far as the Cleric getting the gems thing goes, it's standard and it's done for a reason.  Symbols are VERY expensive and very necessary.  I'm still new to the OS scene with my Cleric but my standard operating procedure has been to symbol the entire group before breaking any camp.  The break in is the worst part and every hitpoint added makes my job easier.  Once the camp is broken and symbols start to blink, I give one to myself, one to the main tank, one to the puller and one to the Enchanter.  On a good night of exp camping, I will easily go through a stack of Peridots.<br>
<br>
The reason that Clerics get all of the gems is that in a lot of cases, the Symbols come directly out of the Clerics pocket.  Karnors Castle, for example, has very little in the way of cash loot and in a good night of exping, I can walk away with a net loss of 300pp.  Other zones are the same way.  That is one of the reasons that Clerics go to OS so much, many view it as a place to restock their Peridot fund.  We're not going trying to go out of our way to hoard all of the cash, we're simply trying to break even from all of the times when we had to pay for Symbols out of our own pocket.<br>
<br>
With all of that being said, I'm not comfortable keeping all of the gems myself and I'm starting to learn the relative value of gem drops so that the group is getting something back as well.  To me a good night would be to recover all of my Peridot costs, come out ahead for the times when I do not recover my costs, and pass along 1 or 2 gems to each member of the group. <p>Islington Angelwatch<br>

<br>
Who the fuck are you to tell me why I join a group?<br>
<br>
Different people play this game in different ways, for different reasons.<br>
Some are interested mainly in levels, some are interested in getting the best stuff for their character, some just want to roleplay, others just want to mess around and have fun.<br>
<br>
Personally, by the way, I tend to fall into the last category. That's why I've been playing this game since beta 4 and still don't have a character above 53 (and have over 150 days on him). I've never camped for an item in my life and I've never been in an exp group for more than about two hours at a time, because I just can't bring myself to care about the exp once the fighting gets tedious.<br>
<br>
Every group I run, I enforce NBG. Why? Not because I feel that it's right or fair, but because this particular way of screwing half the group tends to make fewer enemies and draw less flames than FFA (which screws exactly the same number of people, but in a different way).<br>
<br>
<br>
As for your example of the shroom king group ... well, once again this is just emotional bullshit intended to make your way sound morally right and the other way sound greedy. Hence phrases like &quot;extremely happy little shaman&quot; when he wins, and &quot;sad, poorly equipped little shaman&quot; when he loses.<br>
The fact that, for instance, the enchanter may have spent 30k getting his jewelcraft up to 250 so that he can provide jewelry to his guild (there's very little profit selling it to the public these days) escapes your attention because it doesn't support your point.<br>
So does the fact that the enchanter may also be very poorly equipped and that fungi tunic might help him get some stuff. By your argument he should presumably spend every second in D1 until he gets a bonecaster robe ... were I that enchanter, I can say that would bore the FUCK out of me, and I'd rather fight in random places knowing I might win something I can sell and get some proper stuff.<br>
<br>
The point is .. NBG makes sense only under one extremely limited (and arbitrary) idea of how and why the game should be played, and to tell people that you're morally above them because you play it one way instead of another is not only stupid, but rather offensive.<br>

<br>
Despite what I said earlier, honor is relevant, at least to me.  That's why I still support NBG, even though I get screwed around by it.  Loot is important to all of us, but it isn't everything.  There have been many times when I've been in a group when someone got something that they really wanted and needed, and I've gotten some real satisfaction from that.  I lead pickup raids to Fear, even though there isn't a damn thing in the zone that I can use, other than stuff that drops off of CT.  Nevertheless, it was a real kick seeing Yane get her Vermiculated Tunic on the last raid, just as it was a real kick seeing some guy that I barely know get the final piece for his wizard epic.  If I got a dollar for every time I took out a few hours to help someone kill some mob for their epic quest or whatever, my monthly charges would be covered for a long time to come.<br>
<br>
A lot of people on the server share that attitude, which is why NBG endures despite all of its faults.  It's a lot more fun to play in a cooperative environment than in an &quot;every man for himself&quot; environment.<br>
<br>
What frustrates a lot of us casters is the attitude of so many meleers that NBG is an entitlement that is justified because it screws over the casters.  It was interesting to see so many meleers pretty much come out and say that in this thread.  Honesty is refreshing.  A lot of meleers are outraged that a caster might get a melee item and sell it in EC, but they are nowhere near as upset when a meleer does exactly the same thing (unless, of course, the seller took the item away from another meleer).   That's a sick attitude, and it should come as no surprise to anyone that it pisses off the casters.<br>
<br>
In all fairness, a lot of this problem is caused by Verant's game design.  But that's a subject for a different thread, and Verant isn't going to change things anyway.  We are just going to have to deal with the situation.<br>
<br>
To the person who said that this thread is retarded (or some similarly imaginative comment), I submit that this thread has served two valuable purposes:<br>
<br>
1. It has allowed a lot of casters to blow off some steam, either by posting or from reading other people's posts and seeing their views expressed.  This is always a good thing.<br>
<br>
2. Hopefully, it has provided some &quot;consciousness raising&quot; for some of the meleers.  I doubt anyone has changed their mind on NBG, but hopefully more meleers are aware of how much resentment is simmering beneath the surface when someone decides to push the envelope of NBG.<br>
<br>
With that, I'm going to quit posting and go play the game.  Some of you greedy meleers probably need rezzes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ushodo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shodo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/27/01 1:14:25 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.iconbazaar.com/alphabets/animated/mystic/mysts1-b.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: NBG... how is this fair?</span><hr size=1> Ok so say that were in a place that drops both enchanter items and warrior items.

I think the point that is being over looked here is not the rule of Need Before Greed but the abuse of the rule. Let me give an example like you dont have enough already!<br>
<br>
Warrior_01 joins your group with two Lams.<br>
Seb_Gaurdian_400000001 Drops a Lam.<br>
Warrior_01 says, I need that, I am &quot;borrowing&quot; one of the lams im useing.<br>
<br>
/em ponder...<br>
<br>
This happened to me, I wont ever bring up a name but i think this warrior used the player enforced rule to get another lam and there wasnt a dam thing I could say or do about it. I know I wasnt the only one pist about it as our cleric decided to leave in haste and I dont blame him one bit.<br>
<br>
Need before greed ONLY works when you are dealing with honorable players and lets face it, honorable players are a dieing breed.  I dont see how insulting good people buy saying they sell you gold watches on the street makes this subject any where closer to being fixed or closed. Maybe everyone with a sharp tongues should take a step back and understand both sides...Evol doers! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Keep in mind I am not opposeing NBG per say, I am opposeing its frequent abuse.  We have all seen it and know its out there so dont be blind by your need to stay in control of the game :P<br>
