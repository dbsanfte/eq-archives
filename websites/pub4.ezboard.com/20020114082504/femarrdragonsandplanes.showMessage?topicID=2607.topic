<br>
Im moving the post here as this argument should probably take place here and frankly that thread is annoying me each time I see it bumped.<br>
<br>
I dont appreciate your dire need to invoke conflict upon the fun that myself and the people involved in the raids are trying to have, perhaps that is not your intention but jesus you just dont let up.<br>
<br>
I see no reason whatsoever why I need to explain my decisions to you, but I will humor you for the simple fact that it might shut ya up... so here goes.<br>
<br>
Ok... as explained on my next raid this is why wisdom casters do NOT get to roll on the scale...<br>
<br>
int casters get to roll on - eyepatch, bag, scale (if 52)<br>
wis casters get to roll on - eyepatch, bag, and one of the following: res stick/cleric hammer.<br>
<br>
Meaning that if I let the wis casters roll on the scale it will do 2 things, shaft the bards some more and give the int casters LESS odds of winning (not that the odds are in their favor anyway)<br>
<br>
And as a wis caster who's wisdom is LESS than 185 at level 52 (with damn good gear I might add) dont think I havent thought this through A LOT... <br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>As for encouraging other peeps to not attend yer raid, i did not do that to piss you off, </font><br>
<br>
then you should have posted it somewhere other than my thread...<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>The old thing of " it has been done like this forever" is BS. </font> <br>
<br>
I've never said it was like that forever... its been like that on all *boggles* 11 dragon raids I've gone to... that is all...<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>just try not to call peeps an ass bucket etc</font> <br>
<br>
Not to sound like a whiney child but JUST to point it out to you... YOU started with the insults and name calling in your VERY FIRST post... BEFORE I said anything to you.  So for you to trip out on me over calling you an assbucket was pretty humorous.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>Uber guild leaders are reading the boards. Stuff like that tends to get ya a bad rep. Of course if ya don't ever want to be an Uber guild, then i guess do as you see fit, and enjoy yerself.</font><br>
<br>
that's just funny...<br>
<br>
Dear Jexielia,<br>
     Im sorry my friend but your application to uberguild_02 has been declined due to the fact that in one point (or 50 points in) your EQ career you called some random_player an assbucket.  Please refrain from the retortions and harsh treatment of other players, as all of use in uberguild_02 would NEVER approve of such behavior or would NEVER do so ourselves.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
Guild_Leader of uberguild_02<br>
<br>
frankly... my rep matters shit to me... Im having fun and if someone has a problem with it... then they can EAD =P<br>

I keep seeing everyone complaining about INT casters getting to roll/not roll on the white scale. Well i believe everyone forgot that Wis casters can use it too. stats are ac 10 int/wis 9 cold 25 mana 75.

I have been on these raids, and they are boring as all hell. ya sit in a buff room for an hour, sit in a chat room for an hour, then kill the damn dragon in 2 minutes.How is that exciting, you must be some poor country bumpkin that likes to watch the paint dry on a saturday night if it is.The ONLY reason peeps kill this damn dragon is for the LOOT! If there was no good loot, no one would bother to kill the damn thing.....I would love to see ya argue that point.</font><br>
<br>
(I responded)<br>
*laugh* hey, just because you're a greedy loot monger doesnt mean everyone else is... I went to kill Vox my first time because it was "something new" I didnt even know what she dropped let alone if I could use any of it... I met a lot of cool people and made a lot of new friends. I think each raid is a great opportunity to spend time with people you know or think are cool enough to get to know. If you're playing just for loot and you see no fun in it then wtf do you play? If I owned every item she dropped you could bet your ass I'd be there the next time she's up to drop her with the people who would be there with me. I've met some of the coolest people in the game doing this damn dragon, has nothing at all to do with the loot... yeah I'd like a feking eyepatch but Im not gonna cry over it if I dont get it... I think its more fun not getting it because it gives me an opportunity to try again.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>(Vetinary wrote)<br>
So until i am able to roll on the scale, i will never sign up for these damn raids, and i urge all you other casters to do the same. No casters, and the raid is not gonna happen.Back in the day ,the standard was for all casters to roll on the scale..that was the way it had always has been. It has only changed in the last six months or so, so don't believe that it has always been bard only crap.<br>
</font><br>
<br>
(I responded)<br>
Lead your own damn raid, set your own damn loot rules, stfu, and ead... no reason for assbuckets like you to come along and try to start shit and piss a fit just because you dont agree to the loot rules. <br>
<br>

If your playing this game for the purpose of getting into an uber guild and you act in a way that you think will get you in even if it isn't who you are then that is a real shame.  I am not in an uber guild so I can't speak for them but I bet they are like most other guilds, committees, organizations and they want people who are strong and belong.  I would never take anyone into my organization who would kiss my ass and not give his/her real oppinion.  Nothing gets accomplished that way.  The reason to play is to have fun.  I think what you have said is a damn shame veninari and I think it shows a real lack of charactor on your part.  Jex I wish you the best of luck and as long as your having fun doing what your doing.

You can spout that crap all day if you like but I can guarantee you if you ask any bard in any high level guild they will tell you the same thing. Whereas the cloak may give you some wisdom and some mana to get off a couple more slows/heals/casts a bard without their epic is 3/4 of the character they could be at high levels. <br>
<br>
The sword has a huge party wide buff, allows you to boost songs as if it were an instrument of any type, boosts singing songs by 80 percent so you can stack large damage shields and can provide insane amounts of attack. All this plus nice bonus stats and the ability to melee while providing your songs. <br>
<br>
A caster 'may' wear their WDSC til 60, it is not out of the realm of impossibility. A bard WILL wield thier epic sword til 60 and will continue to wield it as long as they play or unless Luclin gives some immensely ( and I mean immensely) better weapon.<br>
<br>
I normally avoid these discussions but neolithic incompetence like yours draws me out to retort. It may be a character flaw of mine, who knows. That being said, if you don't like the loot rules of a raid then:<br>

<br>
If that were true, then why the hell would you move the post to Rants &amp; Flames to bump it even more instead of allowing it to die?<br>
<br>
I agree with what Crinkle said in the first post .. you do not speak for all wisdom casters Jex, just yourself.  However, your raid, your rules - but if you do something stupid, don't expect people to jump up and down and cheer for you.  You are 100% free to do what you want, just as anyone on this board, including Vetinari is 100% free to voice his opinion on whatever you make public knowledge (i.e. your loot rules).  <br>
<br>
At any rate, how can you specifically decide who gets to random on these items anyway?  I was under the impression the raid was NBG.  If a wisdom caster needs the item more than anyone else on the raid, then why not allow them.  I guess that's just how I personally would run it and like I said, you're free to do what you want on your raid.<br>
<br>
Now go back to your neutral corners and for heaven's sake .. get rid of those flashback 80's colors in your posts Jex. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I noticed your loot rules state that the bards and int casters can random on the scale, even though wis casters can use it equally as the int casters can.  Why not include the wis casters?  <br>
<br>
I know you've stated that it evens out the rolling and spreads it out a bit, but I noted you also stated people should not come to the raids expecting to random on loot (which I agree with), but I would think you have a more stable reason than that, in case all the items you're listing don't drop and someone on the spread out loot rules gets shafted. <br>
<br>
I can't decide personally if bards should be the only ones allowed due to their epics.  I'm getting pretty sick of epics actually .. everyone is turning into greedy loot whores over them, which is why I have stopped actively doing mine, even though it's halfway completed.  <br>
<br>
Then again, everyone is bickering over something that hasn't even dropped yet.   <p>Tormentcia

<br>
Why continue to bump a raid sign up thread?  I have no problem with it being carried on here... seems stupid to keep the thread alive on "Dragons and Planes" when it has clearly become an open debate on loot rules, rather than anything to do with planning an actual raid.<br>
<br>
As far as the loot rules go, we all have our own ways we'd like to see it done.  I for one have had many opinions voiced and I feel that my actions and reasons are just and reasonable... perhaps not fair to "everyone" but I feel that it is a happy medium for all.  If not then they dont need to come.  Anyone can lead a raid, anyone can set their rules, anyone can voice an opinion.  I've heard every side of the story, I have my own personal favorites as far as loot rules, but no matter what I do... not everyone is going to be happy.<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm SO SICK of casters bitching about int/wis at 52 &amp; below.<br>
<br>
My 47 enchanter has nice gear, not impossible or highly expensive to obtain and she's at 219.  No planar gear and before her int buff.<br>
<br>
post 50's its not difficult at all to get to 200 as a wis/int caster.  Except maybe shamans. But they have canni to help them out, so I can't really speculate on what their wis needs are.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I wouldn't even let the int casters roll on the scale, it's its the wis/int you're after, stop going to dragon raids and go camp some of the easier to obtain crap floating around the server.  <br>
<br>
Beyond that, I just love folks who flame folks who lead raids and loot rules.  It makes it so much easier to identify the loot whores right from the get go. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.taloncomics.com/Cao.JPG"><BR>

Jex, no one really gives a fuck about you.  When you quit running dragon raids, someone else will take over, and probably handle themselves with a lot more class than you.  If you'd pull your head out of your ass and actually listen to what Vet and others are trying to tell you, you might actually learn something.

<br>
weren't you a punk farmer yourself not too long ago? Or am I confusing the PoG arguments with someone else?<br>
<br>
Needless to say, this smacks to me of the pot calling the kettle black, because I'm quite sure I remember some PoG threads, and possibly some dragon threads involving torm the troll and you sagemon. Even if I'm confusing the threads, are you going to deny that you ran PoG raids and set the raid rules?<br>
<br>
But, of course, if someone questions YOUR raid rules, they'd be evil loot whores.  Anyone else attempting to do something constructive in this game must be farmers.  <br>
<br>
As a few have stated, don't like the raid rules, don't sign up for the raid.  It's easy.  <br>
<br>
Say, &quot;Gee, I'm not really comfortable with those raid rules, I think I'll sit this one out&quot;  If enough folks feel the same way, there won't be a raid at all.<br>
<br>
It appears to me you have some sort of problem with Jex, who I don't know from Adam.  I could care less about that, fact of the matter is, YOU should know better than to throw out the word farmer, or question a raid leaders right to set rules. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.taloncomics.com/Cao.JPG"><BR>

<br>
That's funny, really.  Now I have Faygo on my monitor  =)<br>
However, I dont really agree with it, athough there are some people who just dont have a clue at times.<br>
<br>
The other night was my second run against Vox (leading) and I must say that other than determining loot rules, organizing groups, announcing MA, SA, going over strats, organizing the buff procedure, and randoming the loot... its a group effort.  And, well, those things are way beyond simple.  I have the highest respect for those that I have raided with and will raid with, and granted one may be deamed the "leader of the raid" but everyone is equally involved and important... some just put forth the extra effort to make sure its possible and successful.  <br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>I care about Jex</font><br>
<br>
*pinks away a tear*<br>
*hugs Snuggums*<br>
Thanks =)<br>
<br>
I dont know who Sagemon is or where his attack came from, which is why it really has no effect on me... nor do I know him enough to "come back".  So, it boggles me... but its his world.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
I know why Bradden would go off and try to attack me, and hey he can do as he wishes.  Im not going to flame or attack him because it will prove nothing.<br>
<br>
As far as being a "dragon farmer"... call it what you will, all Im doing is spending time doing something I enjoy very much.  And yes, I do it because its fun, not because of what I can benefit from it.  We all do different things in the game because we like doing them, otherwise we wouldnt play.  So what if this is what I like to do?  <br>
<br>
I didnt bring the post over here to start a flame fest... it had just become a debate, and I figured there was no better place on this board to "debate" the topic of loot that has been so wonderfully placed before me.<br>
<br>
As far as me not listening to the casters (as stated above) its obvious that I did... because I did alter my loot rules for the next scheduled raid.  Not only that I did everything in my power to explain and clarify the reasons behind the changes and rules that I made.  Im not out to win friends, I have plenty, and the rest will come along naturally with no effort.<br>
<br>
Im not out to attack or make anyone angry, I just figured bringing this here could help everyone (including myself) view things from all perspectives.  As well as get the few people who are determined on going off until the loot rules are in their favor realize that their constant nagging will not win me over.<br>
<br>
I know that no matter what my loot rules are there will be people who will come just for the sake of coming.  That means that there is no reason for me to "need" to please anyone, but this is a game, with lots of people, and I plan to have as much fun as I can... with as many of the people as I can.<br>
<br>
If Im wrong at all for anything that I have said or done, then hey, we all make mistakes.  But I have listened to every point of view, I have tried to come to a compromise and thats a heck of a lot more than I really "needed" to do.<br>
<br>

Your right there were people before and when she hits 53 there will be others to follow.  Is everyone that leads a naggy or vox raid a farmer?
