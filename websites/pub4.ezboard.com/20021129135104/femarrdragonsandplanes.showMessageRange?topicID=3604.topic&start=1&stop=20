That is a bunch of fuc<!>king @#%$. I fully understand a guild trying to get the books for their member, but only some one who is very rude or extremely greedy would roll on the CoF after being given the two books, rules or not, that is retarded and rather fuc<!>king greedy if you ask me. <br>

<br>
I may be wrong, but of the paladins I know I doubt any of them would have wanted anything other than they're books, they'd have been completely happy with that and happy to see the CoF go to someone else who was there to help.<br>
<br>
I know personally if a raid was led in my honor to obtain my epic and it was achieved &quot;I&quot; would not accept anything else... but that's just me, I cant speak on behalf of everyone else.<br>
<br>
The raid rules never said she'd be out of the roll, but I would have been disappointed too.<br>
<br>
Was everything else on the raid one win per person?  Did the other people who won items get to re-roll on additional items?  I guess if it was restricted to others as &quot;one win per dragon&quot; then there would be more reason to be upset about the situation.  <br>
<br>
Im happy to see that someone was able to get their books, and Im happy to see someone else getting flamed for dragon crap other than me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font color=yellow>

I didn't even get to roll on anything that dropped but do you hear me complaining? nope I had a great time.  If you didn't agree with the rules you shouldn't have come plain and simple.  I don't think that in the history of dragon raids has complaining about anyone getting the loot ever changed anything. Stop your little temper tantrum about you not winning and let it go.  Next time you get asked to go on a raid with the leader politley decline.  The raid was great well organized and the rules were all established before hand.  Congrats to Fystie for setting it up and congrats to Knotz for her books and the CoF, maybe one day I will be as lucky as to get one :-)<br>

<br>
Funny that the above statement was a direct quote from the same person who led this raid and justified this person winning the CoF, also, if my memory serves me correctly... this is the same person/guild/group of people who called me greedy for including in my raid rules that if 2 CoF's were to drop... the second would be defaulted to me.<br>
<br>
Defaulting 2 books and giving no one else a shot at them and rolling on/winning a CoF seems to be a hell of a lot more selfish/greedy than me "hoping" for a second CoF to drop so I can claim it :P<br>

<br>
I reserved both books well in advance for Knotz.  Loot rules were clearly stated and repeated many times before hand.  Anyone unhappy with the rules chose not to attend. <br>
<br>
The whole CoF thing is a different story.  2 dropped, and when questioned by others if epic/CoF were 2  seperate randoms I let the raid decide as I never specified one way or another.  Anyone who said anything about this, said they were seperate rolls, and no one complained until the roll between 15 ppl came up with Knotz's number.<br>
<br>
Other's that won things, were included as well as long as it was needed.  <br>
<br>
BTW the Vox and Naggy raids were two seperate raids, and many different faces for each raid.  If you won something on Vox, and then went to Naggy and won your a damn lucky person.  <br>
<br>
The whole greed thing in my opinion isnt an issue.  No one complained until after the roll, and I only remember one complaint then.  If it was such a big deal, you should have spoke up when it was questioned if epic / CoF were on different random scales.<br>
<br>
Jex my coment to you, this one...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You have become selfish and greedy.If a piece of dragon loot means more to you then your self respect, you've become more desperate than can be imagined. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

... is in regard to a different situation entirely.  It was my opinion.  If I wanted to follow in your shoes, I would have had all my 60 friends who came along to buff roll on any item they chose, and I would have defaulted any duplicate drops to me.  <br>
<br>
I was given very good advice once, I'll share it with you all.  If you dont like the loot rules, lead your own damn raid and make your own.  <br>
<br>
I tried to be fair to everyone, and when a sticky situation arose, I let the raiders decide since it was previously specified.  Majority wins. Morale of the story, if your going to biath and whine later at least have the decency to speak up when something can be done about it.  Dont wait until the randoms are through to make a point.<br>

I, however, totally agree with your post and the fact that people should have spoke up... I still, however, find it funny that someone who got their epic book would have even wanted a shot at anything else.  But... that's "my opinion"<br>

I also have an opinion on this...<br>

When you're going to say "if you dont agree with the loot rules dont go" its a good idea to cover the specifics before hand so that it doesnt bite you in the ass.  (Raid leaders or attendees) <p><font color=yellow>

It sounds like you did a fairly good job, I just think Knotz is a greedy loot whore for not removing herself from the random.<br>
<br>
But that is just a personal opinion, I would not have rolled in that situation, but she did. <p><BR><BR>

<br>
Not a damn thing. Loot rules were established as far as I see, and it seems to me the raid force was asked if the epic defaults would exclude the aforementioned Pally from being in on CoF randoms. I guarantee if the raid said &quot;No CoFs to Pally cause they got 2 books,&quot; then Fystie would of aquiesced to the will of the raid.<br>
<br>
3 Rules I follow on pickup raids:<br>
<br>
1) If you don't like the rules, dont go.<br>
<br>
2) If you don't win, dont bitch as long as the rules were followed throughout the raid.<br>
<br>
3) Posting on a public board solves nothing in the grand scheme of things.<br>
<br>
My 2 cents.<br>

Its common (like 1-2 per kill) is a 2hs thats something like 1 delay more than paladin epic.  Its doable by 1.5 tier 4 (just below AoW) groups, so EH should have no problem as a guild.<br>

Fiesti contradicts Cenyar here. Personally I'll believe Fiesti simply because he/she was leading the raid.<br>
<br>
People have made the typical response of 'don't like the rules, don't go' but considering the above it doesnt appear there was any particular rule regarding the pally books and the cof all going to the same person. How can you determine you won't attend the raid if you don't know of the rule? Hell, no one knew of the rule. It had to be determined after the event.<br>

I think the original poster has a legitimate complaint and doesn't deserve to be flamed  for posting here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uazuraine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>azuraine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/5/02 2:28:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3604.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Need Before Greed?</span><hr size=1> Knotz pretty much needed her 2 books &amp; everyone was pleased she got them, but tell me if she reall NEEDED that CoF the same night she got her 2 books?

Pally books are NOT crap loot &amp; usually take many raids to get even one. To get both books then say- hmmmm this isn't enough I want MORE! <br>

<br>
If I'm in an exp group in OS, and a buncha crap loot drops, they get handed out or rolled 1 to each person till each gets, then resets. If a heiro cloak drops for 1 person and an rbg drops later, the first person is excluded from the rbg roll unless he wants to give up Heiro cloak.<br>
<br>
If I am on a raid to Halls of Testing and a chain bracer drops, I will roll on it. If a crown drops later and I want it more, I will offer the bracer for MQ'ing if I can roll on the crown and win. Otherwise I keep my bracer and let someone else get the crown and hope one drops next time. if I get either of these peices and a BP drops, I would feel bad rolling on it even though BP's are treated as seperate from most item drops. If a BP dropped and I won the roll on it, I would reroll the part I won earlier so it could be MQ'd. But this is just me, I am sure there are LOTS of people ot there who think nothing of seeing a buncha stuff drop and rolling and WINNING each one.<br>
<br>
Freezingfists did this didn't he? He grouped up with some people and rolled on 3 drops I think, won them all, and never even offered to reroll any of the items he won. Might have been someone else from the scammer section or rants and flames section, I am not sure.<br>
<br>
I usually tend to think that if I am on a raid and I win anything I am exluded from all others drops on that raid, but again, that's just me. <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br>

<br>
To the person who lost out, well, it sounds like you were given an opportunity to sound off but you didn't, so theres not much can be done about it now.<br>
<br>
It sounds like the raid leader tried her best to be fair, but if it were me I wouldn't have left it to people to decide and would have told the pally that i did not think he should roll on the CoF.<br>
<br>
As for the pally asking to be in on the random for the CoF after getting his 2 books, well, he may have played by the rules but thats just plain greed and there is no honour in that. <br>

When the CoF dropped Fystie asked the ENTIRE raid party about it and NOT ONE of you  said ONE thing about not wanting Knotz in on the role . Since NO ONE said NO and quite a lot of people said INCLUDE her , be quite  aleady . You had your chance to speak but I guess you were not paying attention when you should have been .<br>

If you were not there then you really have no right to comment either since you didn't comment about it when it was asked of the raid party .<br>
