actually, someday i will be majority. Im half Spanish and half Italian if you must know, but i look white. <br>
<br>
There are three different categories of our species.  They are Caucasian, Mongloid and Negroid.  Those are in order from greatest number of people to smallest.  Italian and spanish people are just as caucasian as english and irish.  White really has no meaning other than someone that is fair skinned(but that is Not a race).  <br>
<br>
Don't think all people are sppossed to look the same.  There are many different type of Negroid, Mongloid and Caucasian  peoples.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urittdabard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rittdabard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/20/02 7:00:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=307.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Conservatives</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> i hate Daschle and Gephardt!

Man that is such a dirty democrat tactic, I am so glad the Republicans play so much nicer or else they would have probably wasted the entire tax income of the state of New York for the next decade investigating Clinton's every offensive passing of gas. <br>

This should be blocked, seriously. Soliciting others to spam someone you disagree with is tactless and nutless.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  He was plotting to kill americans and you are arguing for his rights? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
The whole everyone has rights thing is the point of America in my belief. Doesn't one of those documents that we use to define ourselves as a nation mention something about fair trials... or did that just mean innocent people should have fair trials and those found guilty by the fbi, cia, or whatever don't deserve them? <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Bill Clinton - he acted more like a celebrity than a President. He played his saxaphone on tv to get attention. And the Monica Lewinsky affair proved how he was a celebrity. Everyone wanted to live their life thru him, (which is so fake) by finding out all the information and scoops they could find about him. Of course Presidents in the past had sex capades, but it shows you how much of a celebrity he was that his affair became public knowledge.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Ever since the days of the fireside speeches on the radio the president has been a celebrity. Politicians do lotsa fake things in front of cameras to get attention. Its called a photo-op because it was an invaluable to get your picture in the paper making you look good, television just elevated the standard. Or the fact that his affair became public knowledge shows how low the opposition would stoop to discredit him. I think i remember him trying to keep a lid on it not exploit it for air time. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Im a conservative republican, but i didnt give democrats @#%$ about Clinton's affair, cause i dont want to stoop down to their level and bullshit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
<br>
No but the levels you do stoop to are a whole new low in mental exercises. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Oliver North is cool! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
No. No he is not. He is a drug smuggling, self-righteous, unrepitant fool who has helped undermine our respect in many of the third world nations we now have to keep nukes aimed at. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  its funny how liberals fight for rights when it is only beneficial to them and disregard rights of a fetus<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Actually, I see it as pro-choicers placing the rights of free-willed women before the rights of the fetus. I do however generally see the otherside of the argument just not when dribbling like saliva off the chin of a blithering fool. However even when it is not beneficial to me I generally fight for other people's constitutional rights. (see the case of Jose Padilla you mentioned) <br>
<br>

<br>
Guess what Mrs. Brady got her son for his birthday? A gun, in violation of the very act she helped weep through congress after her husband was maimed in a Reagan assisnation attempt. <br>
Guess who's all for fetal cell research NOW...Nancy Reagan, because Ronnie's brain is going faster than Vanilla Ice's street cred.  <br>
Seems like conservatives tend to change their tune when their interests are threatend too. Fvcking hypoctits!<br>

Good thing we beat those damn Britts to, or else our people may these days be subjected to military tribunals and executions without a public trial or disclosure of events therwithin. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Listen to this.... illegal immigrants from mexico are sueing the U.S. because one of their people died due to lack of water. They are saying that the U.S. should have water for them to drink after they cross the border. Now isnt that rediculous? Guess who was the attorney for these illegal immagrants? A liberal of course.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Listen to this...illegal immigrants from mexico were hired by a major hotel chain in minnesotta and then denied wages. It was a conservative that denied these jobs to Americans in an atttempt to reinstitute serfdom. It was a liberal who came to their defence and got them legalized and found them better jobs. He was not a lawyer. <br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  a lady sues a fast food company because her cheeseburger &quot;exploded&quot; in her face. She is sueing because as she bit into her cheeseburger, she was burned and it left permanent marks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
After teen pregnancies rose to an all time high in one community the school system instituted a sex-ed program in the curriculum only to be sued by a conservative coalition who claimed the sex ed program was the cause for the rise in teen pregnancy, when the rise in teen pregnancy was stated and documented as the reason for the class. <br>
<br>
<br>
I think its fair to say that neither side is as righteous as they'd have you believe, however I think both have valid arguable points, if your not so generalizing and closed minded. <br>
