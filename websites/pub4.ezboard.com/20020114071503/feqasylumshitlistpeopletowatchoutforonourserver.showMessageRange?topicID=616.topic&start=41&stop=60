<br>
All I see is, &quot;why is this person still in your guild?&quot;<br>
<br>
Personally, I like Ghon.  He is mouthy, but funny.  I also like Kandom, he is a good guy, even though I don't agree with all he has done.  There are many people that I like a lot, that some people can not stand.  But, then again I pretty much like everyone.  I play this GAME to have fun and make friends.  My guild is like an extended family to me.  Asking me to kick out a friend over a few people not  liking them is like asking me to disown a brother.  <br>
<br>
Belive me I have no problem booting someone that has proven themselves worthless A-holes to the guild though.  As far as Ghon is concerned how he responds to all this when he gets back from vacation, will determine my opinion on his place in the guild.<br>
<br>
Riders has been working hard on getting good people and weeding out the butt heads.  Right now I think we have a pretty good crew, with a possible few I am not sure about still.  But, I am willing to give them a shot.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough babbling.<br>

flashbacks to horror droods in various outdoor zones in the old lands.  Sheesh, I really used to hate that class.  Mostly cause it seemed BUILT for KSing people, named spawns, and just being a dick in general.  Which would probably explain why so many dicks play it.  <br>
<br>
/shrug     People have grown up a bit I think.  The class as a whole has proven its worth to me, and I am more than happy to accept a druid in the cleric/evac spot in a dungeon group.  Primarily for faster killing and thus faster exp.  59 is a holy horror of a level, sheesh.  <br>
<br>
Sounds like just an incident that was bound to happen.  Sheesh, on a PvP server someone would just got nailed and we'd have never heard about it on this board. <br>
<br>
I guess next time  . . . erm, whatever the other druid's name was . . . you should be a bit more careful with yer mana.  Anticipate a bit more, after all, you should know your class.  Or ask for help from a friend.  My good friend Fauchard who plays a 57 druid asked me for help on his corrupted barracuda.  I think he knew he could take it, but didn't wanna take the chances of a random druid coming along and . . . well you know the rest.  So I came and helped and he has his epic now.  <br>
<br>
P.S. Fear kite em, if you aren't already.  It works fantastic.  <br>

Don't worry about me, I can play a druid just fine.  If you had read the whole thread, I did mention that I was almost FULL mana and that I could have probably out nuked Ghon if I was expecting a KS.  Ghon and I were both lvl 55 at the time.  I tried to play by the rules, and Ghon didn't.  Most cheaters win in the short run, but lose in the long.<br>
<br>
BTW Lan, since I don't know my class well enough, why didn't you mention charming the Barracuda to prevent a KS?  Seems like a good idea to me.  But then again, I don't know my class.  /em rolls his eyes<br>
<br>
I tend to get a little offensive when I hear generalizations about how all solo classes are anti-social dicks, or when someone tells me how to play my class.  I ended up camping that Barracuda for a couple days (actual played time).  While I was there I talked with many a druid.  ALL of them were extremely nice.  (Heck, one nice druid offered to let me loot HIS Corrupted piece).  Every class has a dick or two.  Last time I saw any statistics on classes played, Druids out numbered any other class.  Given that fact, there will be more dick druids than any other class.  But I don't think there are more DD's (druid dicks) percentage wise than any other class.<br>
<br>
Sorry Land, but your post sounded a little like an attack.  If you want to talk about druids not knowing how to play their class and being dicks in general, take a look at the other SL post on Ghon.  That should be clear enough for you.<br>

I guess &quot;defensive&quot; is a better word.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm no more defensive now than when I first posted.  /shrug  I knew full well that by posting here I open myself up to attacks like Lands.  Sometimes my tounge may be a little sharp.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I misunderstood what Land was trying to say?  I got defensive at the idea that most druids are dicks and that I don't know how to play my class (implying that I'm a dick that can't play a druid /laugh).  Perhaps I misunderstood his intent?<br>
<br>
I understand exactly what Land is saying about bringing people to help prevent this situation.  Indeed, if I had a couple friends with me, I doubt this would have been a problem.  However, that spawn IS easily soloable by a 50+ druid.  I saw no reason to drag a couple of friends with me for a mob I can do by myself just as a precaution against a KSer.  I despise wasting my friends' time for something I can do on my own.  Thats just the kind of person I am.<br>
<br>
If I have offended you Land, I'm sorry, that was not my intention.  I merely wanted to assure you that I do know how to play a druid (no, I'm not the BEST druid on Lanys, but I'm far from the worst), and that I'm not your sterotypical &quot;Druid Dick&quot;.  (I'm an EXCEPTIONAL Druid Dick.  Just kidding! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

This was the offending remark.  (I'm offended cause you can't remember my name!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  Okay, I misunderstood what you were trying to say.  Fair enough.  After re-reading with your newest comments, I see how I misunderstood you.<br>
<br>
Emotional Baggage?  /chuckle  The 2 people involved in this are both druids.  You made a generalizaton that alot of druids used to be dicks.  Again, you probably weren't directing that at me, but since I play a druid, I felt I needed to defend myself.  I couldn't care less if you hated every druid in EQ just cause they are druids.  /shrug  Your loss, not mine.  No emotial baggage there.<br>
<br>
Do your comments cheapen the encounter for me?  Not at all.  They only prove my point more so.  You are absolutely right!  I should have seen it comming.  I DID know that Ghon shouldn't be trusted.  I knew Ghon was a typical Druid Dick and I failed to prepare properly.  I should have been memming different spells and preparing for a KS fight.  My mistake was that I put a small shred of faith in Ghon.  I'll take full responsibility for allowing him to KS me (I guess I was wrong for putting faith in another human being?).  I wasn't prepared to handle a Kill Stealer.  Does that mean that he was justified in what he did?  In my opinion, he had no right or justification for any of his actions described in my original post.  But that's just my opinion.<br>

I am extremely honored to consider him a friend, and I won't sit back and let somebody treat him like that.  <br>

To Lan- You better re-think the way you post, because that came across as an insult, whether that was your intention or not.<br>

Fortunately I've a thick skin.  <br>
<br>
Shurakair, there, I finally got it right.  Blame the name thing on a bad memory or whatever.  It wasn't personal, as I don't believe I know Shurakair and I rarely make character decisions on people I haven't interacted with.  <br>
<br>
The attitude of my post is: trusting someone you don't know to do or not do anything is ASKING for trouble.  Life's not fair, people aren't inherently good, and the less people know you, the less they will care what happens to you.  Ghon did a bad thing, he was a nasty dr00d who deserves a terrible reputation for his awful act.  Fine, but just remember that he has clones among every class and every level and they are everywhere.  They might even seem to be really nice at first!  They will have friends who vouch for them, even guilds who vouch at times.  <br>
<br>
As for my druid aversion, well I was about over it.  As I said earlier, I like having a druid in the group, at least one who knows what role to assume given group makeup, and most do at this point.  <br>
<br>
But a month or two ago, I had this urge to go see what this &quot;frenzy&quot; camp in Lguk was all about.  I had heard bout people soloing it, mostly necros, and wanted to see if I could solo it too!  Oh, and get an FBSS to use for twinkage.  So I make up a batch of ITU potions, use one, and head down.  I get there, meet my friend who is a wizard and was holding the camp, and we kill a couple of spawns.  Then all of a sudden this assling druid runs into the camp trailing (and i shit you not) about 20 undead frogs!  Gah!  He goes LD immediately and the frogs all jump on me.  I don't know the way out, got 20 frogs on me, and my partner just gated.  I die and have to call in a favor to get myself rezzed and the exp back.  I talked to Cretain who was friends with this dr00d and he told me the drood was pissed that I was camping it cause he wanted to camp it.  Good reason huh? <br>
<br>
Anyhow, I've been trained, KSed, quadkited over and killed, mocked, and loot screwed by members of your class.  Forgive me if I seem a bit down on the druid class, it's a knee jerk reaction.  Lately I've been trying to come back to neutral again, and am doing much better.  I think the arena therapy has been helping with that.  I don't feel quite so bitter after I've killed 10 or so . . . lemme see, last person who actually beat me was a lvl 60 warrior, and I was 53 at the time.  Man warriors can be real badasses at PvP, it's amazing.  Even now I have serious trouble vs. them.  All casting classes are easy tho, druids being the strongest of them.  <br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

Oh my!</span><hr size=1> As a druid, I will be the first to agree with you on a lot of those points, Landragoran.  Yes, Druids can be wonder-weenies...I have seen it happen too many times to want to remember.  It is one of the main reasons I (and from what I have witnessed and know of Shur) make exceptional effort to help others and raise the general spirit of the game.  This is also why it becomes a very personal battle for us when a druid once again drags our name in the muck, and I imagine partial explanation (pardon my assuming on your behalf Shur =) of why Shurakair is so passionate about this event.  <br>
<br>
We try so hard to show others our generosity and integrity, we deal with the snide comments, stereotypes, and being called dr00ds, and then some dinkus comes and pulls a stunt like this, or like what happened to Land in Guk, and we are back where we started.   I am too far removed from the occurances to even attempt commentary on the events with Ghon.  With the information given, I can see both sides of the coin; that he genuinely thought he was responsible for the fish's spawn, and also that he was being slimey and premeditative in his kill steal.  I wasn't there, I wasn't in his head, and I sure don't know what he was thinking, so I shan't venture an opinion either way.  I DO however know Shurakair, and there are not enough amiable expressions in the language to do him justice.  He gives selflessly, is quick to help, and slow to criticise.  A better example of a druid you shall not find..period.<br>
<br>
Landragoran, I have met you before, a long time ago.  You are a very nice guy yourself, and I am very sorry you have had less than favourable experiences in your past with druids.  On behalf of my class, I apologise.  How very sad that such events have occured to make you believe that people aren't inherently good, though this is a completely different subject I care not to broach. =)  Do however, be careful in the construction of your arguement.  I too read your initial post as a debasement first of Shurakair's abilities, and then of druids in general, though I do not believe that was your intention.  <br>

<br>
You need to remember that the list was purged not too long ago, and Ghon's previous exploits were erased so he started from a clean slate.  Now on the new list he's got 2 spots, and there's other times that I've had problems with him in Cobalt Scar.  Basically Ghon is the type of person if he comes into the zone, I usually leave because I know that there will be problems.<br>
<br>
What you do is up to you, but you should think seriously about whether or not all the people that have posted are just all wrong about Ghon or maybe there is some truth behind it. <p><img src="http://www.gusekweb.net/images/newsig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usimc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>simc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sweetiepie Honeybunch</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/10/01 7:05:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghon </span><hr size=1> plur i dont' think sola wanted it locked to protect ghon ..in fact the more we hear of ghon's actions the more we are aware that this guy needs to not only be spoken to but very well may not belong in ROA<br>
<br>
I think sola wanted it's locked because of people like kylian who is nothing but a fucking asshole who thinks he was wronged by roa because i booted is peice of shit ass out of ROA after he removed his main he started bashing ROA and one of our druids was in the zone..when asked why he was doing that he turned his attacks onto that said person. He then called me every name in the book when i explained to him he would either have to remove his alts or i would do it for him.<br>
<br>
He's just one bitter peice of shit....and Kylian remove ROA from your sig if we are so bad..but i know the truth you are a worthless peice of shit that is just taken up space and air. <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">

No offense Aethadar, we just don't kick people out of the guild simply because they got shitlisted.  If it turns out that he really is an undesirable and dirty member we will kick him, but we have to talk with him first and look into it.<br>
