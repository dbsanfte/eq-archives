[The CIA said on Wednesday that one of its officers was &quot;killed in the line of duty&quot; in Afghanistan, the first acknowledged U.S. combat death there. The statement from CIA Director George Tenet identified the man as Johnny Micheal &quot;Mike&quot; Spann, who worked for the Directorate of Operations, the part of the agency responsible for covert operations. Tenet's statement says Spann was &quot;where he wanted to be; on the front lines serving his country.&quot; The flag over the Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, has been lowered to half-staff.]<br>
<br>
Boo fucking hoo. I feel for this guy's family, as I'm sure all of us do, but is this really front page news? Does the first guy to die in a car wreck get pasted all over the media airwaves? Not quite. Of course the term killed in the line of duty is in quotes, serving up a reminder to the American people that this guy was over there minding his own business, doing a glorified and holy job for Uncle Sam, when some terribly mislead Muslim fundamentalist criminal mastermind bag of shit killed him without warning in a most heinous manner. It is, of course, no problem when we enter into mortal ballistic charged combat with bad guys and win. If our guys kill them it's ticker tape and floats. If they clip one of our own it's a media hoedown starting with the life story of a guy who probably had the drop on the fool that got him and lost his nerve when it mattered most and ending with a recap on the fundamentalist terrorist Islamic nation that must be stopped at any cost.<br>
<br>
Let me explain something to some of you out there who have listened to the media so far. You've heard a lot about the Islamic Jihad I'm sure, the &quot;Holy War&quot; that these fundamentalist terrorists are waging against America. Jihad has been given a terrible reputation by the media that has been designed to protect and inform We the People, as has the religion that founded the principle. Well let me clear a little bit of this up. Jihad does not mean &quot;Holy War&quot; in any shape, form, or fashion. It is literally translated to the words &quot;to struggle to one's utmost.&quot; It is directly related to the belief of suffrage in the Christian religion, a constant and unyielding battle with one's own self in the light of sin, oppression, and temptation.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the people we're fighting in Afghanistan are not Muslims. They are a cult based loosely on selected teachings and texts from the Islamic Word. The media did not call David Koresh and his Branch Davidian nutcase junkies Christians engaged in a Holy Crusade, but rather referred to them as a cult. How dare they slander the Islamic religion over a few bad apples! They've been feeding us misleading information from the beginning in an attempt to sway We the People to the favor of war. America loses military and police personnel &quot;in the line of duty&quot; on a regular basis without a front-page news story. This incident is a clear reflection of the terrible and misleading &quot;news&quot; we're being force fed by the media of the United States. <br>
<br>
[&quot;Although these captives had given themselves up, their pledge to surrender -- like so many other pledges from the vicious group they represent -- proved worthless,&quot; [said Tenet].  U.S. officials said Spann was in the prison at the time of his death, gathering intelligence from Taliban prisoners &quot;about Taliban intentions and whereabouts.&quot;]<br>
<br>
Number one, how can a group of people give themselves up without surrendering? Who do we have running the show over there, fucking Big Bird? Let me see if I can break this down...our boys were shooting at some bad guys in an attempt to kill them, and the bad guys were shooting back in defense. They gave themselves up and became, as Tenet says, &quot;captives.&quot; Once they had given up, ceased firing, and moved to the &quot;captive&quot; status, our now-dead spook moved in. Once he was inside, the &quot;captives&quot; changed their mind and decided not to surrender after all and killed him. I would expect a CIA operative, particularly a field operative with Marine background, to know that people in life and death situations are fully capable of lying in order to win. Next we'll have Special Forces men getting stabbed after hearing that their shoelace is untied. Of course, that's exactly what you'd expect from the Islamic fundamentalists and the &quot;vicious groups they represent.&quot;<br>
<br>
Number two, if this vicious group has broken so many pledges in the past, why in the hell would these idiots take their word this time around? I've always thought that the CIA was a cut above, employing intelligent, capable people. I know the average intelligence factor in America is absolutely horrible, but I never thought I'd see it seeping into the CIA. It makes me absolutely, unbelievably, and completely sick to know that my freedoms, my safety, and my security is in the hands of men who have no more ability to assess the situation and act accordingly than I had at six years of age. Of course he was gathering intelligence about &quot;Taliban intentions and whereabouts.&quot; Apparently the CIA hasn't quite figured out what they're doing over there. A few more body bags and they'll get a handle on it though...I would hope.<br>
<br>
[Tenet said Spann's body has been recovered. A CIA official told CNN &quot;only today as daylight broke&quot; were U.S. officials able to reach the part of the prison where Spann's body lay, but officials believe he was killed Sunday. U.S. officials say Spann was armed at the time of his death. Spann, 32, joined the CIA in June 1999. He was a former Marine. &quot;Mike Spann was an American hero,&quot; Tenet said, &quot;a man who showed passion for his country and his agency through his selfless courage.&quot;]<br>
<br>
I wonder how many unarmed Muslims died when the Marines went in to retrieve the body.<br>
<br>
If Mike Spann was an American hero who showed passion for his country and his agency though what some people believe to be selfless courage, then I hope to God I'm never given the title of hero. This isn't the last hero to come from this escapade though. Every American who dies in this war will be called a hero.<br>
<br>
I can see it now...the next big CNN story:<br>
<br>
&quot;An American Marine died this evening in Afghanistan in his sleep after complaining of an upset stomach. It has been determined that the serviceman had a mild case of the flu that had been untreated for some time. A statement from a high ranking military guy said &quot;This dead flu guy, whoever he was, is a real American hero. While we know that he never fired his weapon in combat, never came in contact with any Islamic fundamentalist terrorists, never spoke badly about anyone, and never really helped out at his base camp, we also know that he died while dreaming about the passion and energy he showed in serving his wonderful country and the corps. His courage and deeds will not go unrecognized, this great American hero who suffered so valiantly through the flu while the rest of us were looking for people with turbans to shoot.&quot; <br>
<br>
he·ro<br>
n. pl. he·roes<br>
<br>
1. In mythology and legend, a man, often of divine ancestry, who is endowed with great courage and strength, celebrated for his bold exploits, and favored by the gods. <br>
2. A person noted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose, especially one who has risked or sacrificed his or her life: soldiers and nurses who were heroes in an unpopular war. <br>
3. A person noted for special achievement in a particular field: the heroes of medicine <br>
<br>
Not all dead soldiers are heroes. I truly feel sorry for the men and women who have actually done deeds above and beyond expectations in the face of certain death to save or secure fellow soldiers. It makes my stomach turn to hear that the word hero is being applied to anyone who dies at the hands of an enemy these days. When all is said and done this man who died, most likely alone without the chance to fight back, will be placed on the same level as the true heroes. He'll probably be awarded a posthumous medal for his undying bravery and passion. The only medal that should be awarded here is the Pulitzer prize. These media assholes have twisted the deaths of everyday soldiers who screwed up in the line of duty and most likely deserved what they got into saints.<br>
<br>
I am saddened that an American operative died to the hands of the enemy. We all knew it would happen sooner or later though, and we all knew it would get more attention than Chandra Levy. How many Islamic men and women in the United States and abroad have been persecuted, beaten, and even killed because of the misleading information the media has flushed thus far though? How long are We the People going to allow the media to control our thoughts, our feelings, and our very lives? Spann's death is a wake up call to the population, a sign that we need to shut off the television, kick the reporters out, and start getting the truth about what is happening in our world and in our wars. We the People deserve accurate, unbiased, correct information on every aspect of each and every story playing out on our planet. We are not getting it. The fundamentalist groups in Afghanistan are a problem, but the real enemy is here, in our home land. The American people have a bigger war to fight than against terrorists abroad. The real terrorists are on our television sets, writing in our newspapers and magazines, feeding selected bits of information to the population of America.<br>

Good, good for you. I assume that you'll be leaving shortly to go get a handle on the &quot;truth&quot; over there.<br>

<br>
A real hero gets his start by putting his money where his mouth is. I sure as fuck hope you've got alot of cash. Your main gripe seems to be that the media is cashing in on the dead body of a field operative in order to spread opinionated commentary.<br>
<br>
Not that you would ever do the same, asshole. At least they get paid. You'll capitalize on the dead for fucking free.<br>

<br>
I should not have to leave to get a handle on the &quot;truth.&quot; I should be able to sit at home and get honest, unbiased, accounts of whatever is happening without the influence of political or emotional pressure.<br>
<br>
My apparent knowledge of what constitutes heroism is limited only to the past as documented in our own history. I've never heard of a solitary man getting killed in the line of duty behind enemy lines called a hero unless they had accomplished a great deed that was worth their life. Even those who went into the fray and lived rarely consider themselves heroes. The word is being polluted, accounting for pretty much every American and Allied death. Those who are worthy of the title are being stripped of its meaning.<br>
<br>
A real hero gets his/her start by deciding what's important to him/her, then working out any and all scenarios by which these important parts of their lives can be brought to terms. A real hero does not fail in their duties or endowments, but rather accomplishes them to a degree not generally experienced by the masses.<br>
<br>
I do have a lot of cash.<br>
<br>
You are somewhat correct in your assessment of my &quot;main gripe.&quot; I am disgusted by the media of this country, particularly the fervor and ferocity with which they bring us stories that should normally be given slightly less attention. I truly feel for the family and friends of the lost agent, though I don't believe that it is front-page news. The media is primed to bring the public only the hottest, most scandalous, and most exciting news available. This often leaves circumstances that the American public should be aware of unknown. I am equally upset by the comments being made by the spokesmen for the CIA and military forces, who insist on calling a man a hero yet deliver no reason for the title.<br>
<br>
I would do the same. I spread &quot;opinionated commentary&quot; on topics ranging from the misuse of a word to education reform. I compile page after page of this &quot;opinionated commentary&quot; on a regular basis. In the end, I am always open to discussion and comments, and will converse freely on any given topic. I will support my arguments until I am shown otherwise, which has been known to happen before.<br>
<br>
I do it for a different reason though. Unlike the mass media, I get paid literally nothing to write what I think. I do it because I have a problem with something or because I absolutely love something. I do it to open up discussions and to find out where everyday people such as myself stand on topics. If I were ever paid to write my thoughts on any topic it would be under the strict guideline that anyone who feels that they have something to say on the topic should be given ample opportunity to respond.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that you suffer from a similar writing habit to the one I have had for some time. As the page grows longer, my own words begin to grow more and more feverous. I generally begin by attacking a few points, and close with outright anger. Do keep in mind, I'm not attacking this writing style, merely pointing out that we have a similar tendency. I often end my commentary with a rather sarcastic statement as well, as you've apparently noted.<br>
<br>
I cannot, however, remember ever closing an argument with a statement like &quot;eat a dick.&quot; I invite you to disagree with anything I may say or imply in any direct or indirect terms, but remember one thing. You may be quite capable of carrying on a conversation with someone that you disagree with to the point that their stance is altered by your perception of the matter. You'll never find out if you make an enemy of them though. Never attack a person if your goal is to challenge their perceptions.<br>

No, you shouldn't. You're given a free press, not an unbiased press. If you want to see your own opinions echoed in the media, get off your fat ass and buy another newspaper. If you never see your opinions in any press, either start your own or take the hint.<br>

&quot;You are somewhat correct in your assessment of my &quot;main gripe.&quot; I am disgusted by the media of this country, particularly the fervor and ferocity with which they bring us stories that should normally be given slightly less attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
The media isn't paid to be right. They're paid to entertain you, so they print the stories people want to read. The media isn't a collection of priests who take vows of factual representation and civil service.<br>
<br>
If they don't print what people want to read, then they go out of business.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I do it for a different reason though.&quot;<br>
<br>
You can rationalize all day. You're still pissing on another man's grave to advance your opinion. No doubt every vulture feels morally justified in his actions, but it doesn't change the nature of the deed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is obvious that you suffer from a similar writing habit to the one I have had for some time. As the page grows longer, my own words begin to grow more and more feverous.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I believe in thrift when writing. Long, ponderous posts filled with self-indulgent musings activate my pretentious ass alert. When I want to insult the person to whom I address my post, I do it. I don't try to stun them into boredom with some droning build-up to a point which is dubiously made, at best.<br>
<br>
One question, Mr. Heroism. Would you have had the balls to say this to that operative BEFORE he was dead?<br>
<br>
No. I don't fucking think so.<br>
<br>
So, by all means. Eat a dick.<br>

<br>
Actually, the media is expected to be correct when presenting factual information.  A news piece and an opinion piece are two different things, and to suggest to most news reporters that they do not represent the facts accurately is a really, really serious insult.  I'd agree that your post reflects how things are, but there's no way that I'd agree that's how things should be.  The press has certain responsibilities, and in a lot of ways they've been shirking those responsibilities in recent years.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I'm not touching this thread with a 10 foot pole.  You made your bed Tove, regardless of any valid points you may have made.  That guy died fighting for something he believed in, and whether or not you agree with him you should show him a little bit of respect for that.<br>

In many ways the media plays an important role in the American foundation. The most understood planks of this way of life are presented in the Judicial, Legislative, and Executive branches of government. The media is yet another form of the so-called &quot;checks and balances&quot; in a sense, charged with presenting the People with the information necessary to complete the whole equasion. They have been shirking their responsibilities in recent years, as have the branches of government sworn to balance one another. That's an entirely different subject, however, so I'll not get into it.<br>
<br>
I don't have any problem with you avoiding the thread as a whole, considering the fact that you did make a rather valid point in closing. When writing the original text I was more intent on expressing my discontent with the representation of the events and man than actually thinking about the American killed in combat. While I still feel that he was not a &quot;hero&quot; in the strictest sense of the word, I do feel for his family and friends. Each and every one of our service personnel over there are in the line of fire and certainly deserve an immense bit of respect. Looking back, I should probaby have included something of this nature in the original post. We are lucky indeed to have men such as this who will rise up and fight in the name of the country we all hold dear.<br>
<br>
Thanks for pointing that out Arikel.<br>

Nonsense. Your TAXES pay for the three branches of government. Taxes DON'T pay for the media.<br>
<br>
It's a consumer enterprise, which I'm not entirely sure you understand. CNN has to attract advertisers in order to continue operating...they don't get any of your tax dollars.<br>
<br>
You want unbiased reporting? Reuters and the AP wire. It's not that hard, where do you think the unpolished news comes from in the first place?<br>
<br>
Get bored? Buy Playboy. It's amazing how good the reporting is when it's the porn that sells the magazine.<br>
<br>
Need more? Jane's website is spectacular. They pay the bills with other things, so again, they can print what they like...which is usually just hard data.<br>
<br>
Of course, these REQUIRE EFFORT ON YOUR PART. They require you to spend a bit more money, or to exercise your ability to think.<br>
<br>
You seem to believe that some mysterious charitable organization should exist merely to spoon feed you &quot;the truth&quot; for free. Or perhaps you feel the government should monitor all news sources to make sure that only &quot;the truth&quot; is being printed...what a nice idea.<br>
<br>
Here's a better one: Put forth the effort to find the facts, and don't rely on advertisers to do it for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I should not have to leave to get a handle on the &quot;truth.&quot; I should be able to sit at home and get honest, unbiased, accounts of whatever is happening without the influence of political or emotional pressure.&quot;<br>
<br>
You'll get the government, AND the news, that you deserve. I don't feel an ounce of sympathy for you.

<br>
Correct.<br>
<br>
So far all I've seen is a lesson about the way things are currently. It would appear that the entire focus of these arguments is a quick overview of the current state of events parked behind an all-too-common &quot;if you don't like it, go somewhere else.&quot; That's generally something one only hears from a source that is intent on speaking against anything put forth in their path.<br>
<br>
When was the last time you heard a news bit about Chandra Levy? While it really didn't deserve the airtime it was getting in the first place, it is now nonexistant on the airwaves. Whatever happened to the Microsoft suit? It went from front page news to a sideline in a matter of minutes. Where's the media attention focused on education? Each generation is getting infinitely less intelligent than the last, and nobody seems to notice. Some of the most important decisions in out country are being made behind the glamour of this war, and the media is simply refusing to report on it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bottom line: the news media claims to deliver us the unbiased facts, and yet it does not. If we apply your standards, treating the news media as a consumer business, we most certainly are entitled to get what is advertised. End of story.&quot;<br>
<br>
Absolutely correct. Would the people all start smoking if the tobacco companies started spouting false advertising regarding the benefits of nicotine?<br>
<br>
Regardless, this is my last response to the &quot;that's the way it is, just deal with it&quot; mentality. I believe that is the attitude that will eventually screw everything up in the world.<br>

Not always can you get the whole story by reading a news article in a so called &quot;trustworthy&quot; magazine, or on a television news spot. This brings us to the root of the problem:<br>

Unfortunatly, I believe there IS no solution.  The Media is a huge juggernaut that would bulldoze a few people that demand unbiased reporting straight out of existance.  It would take a change of the majority of the American people to DEMAND it, and boycott the &quot;news&quot; agencies that dont deliver.  But, this isnt going to happen.  Most Americans are perfectly willing to sit back and absorb this processed, &quot;better for you&quot;, version of the news.  Fat and happy, thinking that everything the news agencies tell them is 100% true and should be taken at face value.<br>

A rather interesting post Tovectris. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The above quote caught my eye early on.<br>
<br>
I just want to remind you that when an American dies in the live of duty they are at once a &quot;hero&quot;. The poor schmuck may have only been peeling potatoes in a mess hall that got bombed, but he will get a &quot;hero's&quot; welcome back to the states. A hero in this context is simply one who dies in the line of duty. The dictionary definition you provide for &quot;hero&quot; is historically important, but we should not neglect the everday common usage of the word, too. Shit, if my cat Buffy is rescued from a tree by a half retarded senior citizen the person who does the rescue is a &quot;hero&quot; automatically. Small town media have been known to even report such events. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, I guess what I am saying is that while you have presented a very well thought out message (and an eloquent one at that!) you may have missed a very important fact. The media only serves up what the common folk want to see, hear and read. It is called enterprise... capitalism. So, the next time you read about a soldier's death somewhere and he/she is eulogized as a hero, just remember that is not a spin by the media, or some government conspiracy to control the media, nope... it is the media reflecting the majority population of the good ole US of A! So who are the terroists now? You are pointing the finger in the wrong direction. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
