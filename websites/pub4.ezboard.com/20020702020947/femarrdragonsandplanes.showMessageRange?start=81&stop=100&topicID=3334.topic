One of the directors here is an avid Star Wars fan and this morning I asked him if he wished to have a 2 1/2 hour meeting at the UCG cinema across the road. He declined but offered that I have the meeting all by myself. I accepted with pleasure.<br>
<br>
It is better the second time. Thanks to Shara for helping me decide to go again.<br>
<br>
Here's what I never noticed the first time. <br>
<br>
The imperial guards in the first scene in Palpatines chambers. The fact that the chair Palpatine sits on is exactly the same as the Emporers chair on the Death Star in Jedi.<br>
<br>
I can understand why Threepio and R2 don't remember the Lars. ( Possibly the data was erased from their memory ) but someone tell me why Owen Lars doesn't recongnize Threepio and R2 in A New Hope despite Threepio having been there for 8 years? <br>
<br>
Little things I missed seem to make the film so much better when you watch it second time around. Jar Jar still needs to go though. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

As for owen and lars not remembering them, I could only say that in new hope its been something like 30-50 years ( i think ) and to most people droids are just tools.  Do you remember a tool you had 50 years ago?<br>

I guess it gives fans something to argue about. (Caveat, I still haven't seen AOTC, so I can only comment based on hazy memories of Phantom Menace.) If Lucas had left the droids way in the background, not interacting with the main characters at all, it would have been more entertaining for me, i.e. R2D2 saves the ship in PM, but he's just another droid, no introduction to the princess. Do you introduce your hammer to Amidala (besides the euphemism version)? Obviously different people could perceive robots in their own ways, from tools to servants or slaves to metal people, but then I would expect more tension in the background. <br>
<br>
  For that matter, given the amount of droids in PM's time, why bother with human slave labor? Humans might be more general purpose, but there didn't seem to be a lack of technology on Tat. to explain the minimal robot presence. Dust maybe, but the designs of the pod racers if nothing else suggests that's not a significant enough problem. Human slavery could exist alongside a major robotic workforce for cultural reasons, but it felt like something made just to keep Anakin's mother on the planet. (Hey Jedi, just steal her or something? Western Express some money? Forget the kid, get the old lady?) Actually, it's bad to think about PM's plot, because it seems worse the more I consider the details. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukerryndarkwater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kerryn Darkwater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1563<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/21/02 2:06:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3334.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....droids</span><hr size=1> Well, you see heres the difference.<br>
<br>
Watch the scene where Anakin goes to see Watto carefully. In this Watto says he sold Shmi years ago &quot;Hey business is business, you know how it is Ani&quot;<br>
<br>
For Threepio to end up with the Lars Watto had to sell him at the same time as Shmi putting Threepio with the Lars for several years. Reasonably we can only expect Padme and Anakin to be together for 3 years at maximum before the Jedi council intervenes so your correct when you say that 23 years will pass before Owen and Beru see the droids again. Would you remember a tool you had 23 years ago? Wrong analogy. Till you meet tools with different voices, names and personalities this metaphor will always remain wrong.<br>
<br>
I can't say what I'd remember from 23 years ago but I'm damn sure that in another 23 years I'll remember the cars Ive owned, the colours and the registration plates.<br>
<br>
And droids don't get wiped on a regular basis. They get wiped as neccessary and that's why C3-PO and R2-D2 remember things in A New Hope from before their time with Captain Antilles. But I understand that their memory would have the Lars family selectively deleted from their data files. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
Yes the film leaves you slightly disappointed, much like Empire did (as far as good guys winning a big victory, I still liked Empire the best personally)  But you have to remember this is the story of how Palpatine connived and came to power, corrupted Anakin, and destroyed all the Jedi except Yoda and Obi Wan who go hide on obscure planets.  Obviously some bad sh_t happens in this prequel timeline.<br>
<br>
The droid thing is a little weird.  I think Lucas wanted to give us something familiar in these first 3, and what is more identifiable with SW than blue fire hydrant and goldenrod?<br>
<br>
Some possible rationalizations of the droids - Lots of droids have the exact same build as C3PO and R2.  Perhaps Annakin &quot;built&quot; 3PO out of spare parts he found in the junkyard, but he knew and followed the blueprint of a standard protocol droid.  He is basically like a kit car or kit computer if you will.  No special reason to *recognize* something that is exactly the same as other protocol droids.<br>
<br>
As for Annakin's acting, recall how you felt then.  The world (your parents) were holding you back and would not recognize that you were ready (in your own mind) for the world.  You were sullen, resentful to them and the world, prone to childish lapses in judgment, and generally still too immature for the real world, which is exactly why your parents held you back.  You were also too immature to realize any of this and were just sullen, brooding, and resentful.  DING DING DING.  That's Annakin for you.  Huge potential, no clue how to control it and discipline himself yet.  I think the actor did a good job portraying that.  Remember teenagers are sullen, unpleasant little bastards.  I know I was.  That doesn't mean the portrayal of that is bad acting.<br>
<br>
What I hope the 3rd movie reveals is the exact nature of the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the force?  Is this supposed to be Annakin, as a Jedi who turns to the dark side and then returns to the light?  Is it really Luke who destroys the Dark Side and helps redeem a fallen Jedi?<br>
<br>
Ok, on to rampant speculation.  Who else thinks that the Emperor and Annakin make some sort of lifeforce pact when he gets hurt in 3?  Annakin vows he will learn to stop death (something along those lines) after his mother dies.  Intriguing foreshadowing.  I (rampantly) speculate the Emperor uses his dark powers to help keep Annakin alive until he can build his Vader suit, but the price is lifelong servitude to the Emperor.  This is also why Vader dies in RotJ.  His wounds were not that bad, and the Emperor lightning bolts he takes from throwing Palpatine down the tube were not that bad, Luke took 3-4 blasts and lives.  Yet Vader still dies, and knows he is dying.  I was also reminded of the lines where Luke tries to persuade Vader to leave and come with him, and he tells Luke you do not understand the power of the dark side, I can never leave my master.  Maybe if he left he knew he would die.  Yoda tells us the force can extend lifetimes, and the Emperor certainly lives longer than normal humans do.  Perhaps he is also able to help Vader live in a similar manner.<br>

I've now seen bits with C3PO during the final battle, and talk about cheesy lines aimed at kids. The action was really too busy to allow time to groan. In fact, that's part of my problem with PM and AOTC, the pace and scale. Clearly Lucas wants to show off the CGI he has at his disposal in an epic fashion, much as widescreen film directors once went a bit overboard. Unfortunately, too many scenes taking in the full range of huge battles just keeps us from connecting with the few characters we actually know. Throw in a hokey, contrived setup for a massive battle. (Why do the Jedis stand there in the arena? Why doesn't Dooku have missiles or bombs or landmines prepared? Why isn't Dooku dead before it starts, or at least attacked? BTW, great Jedi, try finding some freakin' cover, or move in among your foes. You are faster and they can't shoot without hitting each other then.)<br>
<br>
  Yoda, I can understand you are using the Force to get around. I was trying to be impressed, but instead I was on the verge of laughter. Flubber anyone? (Or that ball in Men in Black.) If you're so great, why did such a cheesy stunt let Dooku get away? At least it could have been a last contingent of robots AND the great big conveniently ripped down cylinder of death.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uguildon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guildon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/21/02 11:05:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3334.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance</span><hr size=1> I guess I put this in the wrong place because I'm sure I'll get flamed for my opinion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I came away from this movie thinking damn this movie was .....<br>
absolutely terrible. <br>
<br>
<br>
The acting was atrocious. Very few of the characters had on screen presence at all. Exceptions being Christopher Lee and Ewan Mcgregor. The dialogue was awful and forced. For those of you trying to suggest that the dialogue in episodes 4-6 was the same check yourself and watch the films again. Yes there was some bad dialogue but those characters could pull off that diaglogue because the dialogue was actually witty. This dialogue wasn't even suitable for Scary Movie 3.<br>
<br>
First,<br>
<br>
Anakin- Again I don't see any way that this character in Episode 2 mimics anything of what Darth vader becomes. Yes Luke Skywalker was petualant but he wasn't so whiney and he at least listened to Obi Wan and showed respect. Luke was curious about things just like Anakin was in Episode 1. Anakin would have been 1000x better had they made him much more elegant with curiousity yet hinted at dark side tendancies/elements. Essentially he was an Nysc'd version of Anakin Skywalker. Even though he would have been a bit old for the part, Jude Law would have made an incredible Anakin Skywalker in Episode II. He has that aura of refinement along with a dark, brooding, character. Not to mention he can act. The love scenes were like one night stand pick up lines. No chemistry between the Queen and Anakin<br>
<br>
Queen A- Again a total miscast. She's supposed to be ten years older no? Why not get a new actress?. Portman was brutal in Episode I why bring her back? I haven't thought of a replacement because currently there seems to be a dearth of refined strong willed actresses who have that particular on screen charisma. Portman has the charimatic presence of a rock. Her dialogue has little feeling or emotion and the love scenes were forced like the poster said above. It looked like she'd rather pull splinters out of her ass all day than be anywhere near Anakin. <br>
<br>
Mace Windu- I love Samuel Jackson but he's much too stiff to play this role. It just doesn't work well. He's better here than in Episode 1 but he still seems way out of place. Lawrence Fishburne, as someone in my office suggested would have been a better cast. If you don't believe me look at the job he does playing Morpheus in the Matrix. He's already on his way to James Earl Jones status. Stoic character with an incredible speaking voice which demonstrates great power.<br>
<br>
Obi Wan- Ewan McGregor was solid, much better than in Episode one. Looks like he's rounding into shape. He was one of the few highlights in an absolutely dreary movie.<br>
<br>
Count Dooku- Christopher Lee was the star. By far an away the best actor in the entire movie. He was credible as a power Jedi Master and he had the grace and refinement to play the part. He has a very powerful on screen charisma. Too bad his part was relatively short.<br>
<br>
Jar Jar Binks- He sucks kill the bastard now! Why Lucas insists on returning this character is beyond me. Shouldn't have been in episode one much less returning to episode two.<br>
<br>
Boba Fett- Did anyone else want to punch this kid in the mouth for his pedantic and inane behaviour. Hey I know he's a kid but he acted like a two year old instead of the 10 year old he's supposed to be. Boba Fett is a stoic character in epidsodes 4-6. He's ins't some dumb kid who acts like some prepubscent teen that's worried about getting his candy.<br>
<br>
Emperor Palapatine- Ian Mcdarmid (sp?) is excellent in the film but he must be scratching his head wondering why he signed on for this tripe. He gets his role because he was there for episodes for 4-6. He understands the context of the role.<br>
<br>
Jengo Fett- I was faily neutral on this character. Felt he was decent but didn't really impact the movie other than to explain a sub plot of Episodes four through six. Could have used a bit more background IMO.<br>
<br>
Everyone keeps saying that this is fantasy film and I agree but that doesn't give poetic license to make characters that don't make sense. Part of the allure of the original episodes was the development and continuity of the original characters. They matured but you could see a linear progression. Heck Anakin in Episode 1 was more mature and refined than Anakin in Episode two. Sure , in episode 2 Anakin is a teen but he's shown as a dolt and a whiner. He's a risk as a jedi candidate in Episode 1 because he's conflicted and fearful not because he's a whiney and ignorant malcontent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to admit the special effects were incredible but they seemed wasted on this abominable film. <br>
<br>
<br>
Overall It's a D on an A-F grade scale. Only the special effects and agood acting by a few save this movie from an F rating. I was so close to actually walking out on this movie and I haven't walked out on a movie since Pret A Porter in 1994 and I've seen some horrible films since then.<br>
<br>
Now if you want a movie with excellent plot development as well as character development and action and very good love scenes see Spiderman if you already haven't. Spiderman has very few flaws and the flaws in and of themselves are acceptable because they really don't interfere with the story.<br>
<br>
No I'm not some 40 year that can't get over the original series. I disliked the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi. I didn't make me hate the movie because the rest of the movie had excellent dramtic scenes just like episodes 4 and 5. It's that I don't sense any drama. This is a John Woo like movie with excellent coregraphed fight scenes but lacking in plot and drama to build up to the scenes. I'm 27 so maybe I don't get these movies but what made the first movies so great was the excellent balance of fight scenes drama and a climatic story like a cliffhanger.  The dialogue while not amazing in episodes 4-6 was made simply the beliablity of the repartee between the characters involved. The problem with Episode 1 an2 is that the dialogue isn't as good and this problem is magnified by the lack of credibility of repartee between Anakin, Padame (Queen), Obi Wan etc ...<br>
<br>
The movie moves at an uneven pace.which really killed me. The story was fine bu the execution was poor is simply whatit comes down to. Miscast actors and non-linear character and plot development killed this movie for me. <br>
<br>
No, I didn't watch this movie to critique it. I went as a Star Wars fan looking to watch the movie, this is stuff that came to mind while I was watching it. I didn't bring a pad and paper to write every inconsistency and issue I had. I just walked of the theatre disgruntled and wondering what happened to the execution of a movie which had a good plot yet failed mightly to provide the richness of character that episodes 4-6 gave me. In those episodes I could easily and willfuly identify with the characters. Can I identify with Anakin? Not at all. Sure I've been bitter and sure I suffered from the avarice of youth, but I wsan't supposed to be a jedi and I certainly had much greater conviction and a sense of morality at the age or what 18, 19 than Anakin did. Maybe I'm abnormal for this. Sure I act immature, but like everyone else says it's fantasy so he can be held to different standards an he should represent a sterotypical teen in today's society. Fantasy doesn't have to be realistic but why not at least keep it consistent.<br>

It's nice to have references and symbolism but good lord you don't need to bash us over the head with it. I actually like Obi wan's line that was something along the lines of &quot; Why do I think you'll be the death of me&quot; This line made sense. It was a great foreshadowing line yet in a comical sense which is the trademark of the original movies. Otherwise the movie hinted at way too much and left very little to the imagination. <br>
<br>
As for the plot it was obvious that Anakin lost his arm to relate to the fact that Luke chops off his hand in RotJ and Luke loses his hand in ESB. Great, thanks for the reminder, you already had this in two movies why recycle this theme. Why not change Anakin's physical loss to explain why he becomes a machine. Are we supposed to believe he his golden arm is a substructure/skeleton for his Vader outfit when we all know that when he gets his arm cutoff all you see is wiring and no golden what so ever? Or is he going to have his arms mechanically refitted like Luke in ESB. (This will happen in Episode 3 to cover up the inconsistency of the golden arm with the arm shown in RotJ.)<br>

I'd love to see how they would end it, but at the chance of screwing things up with a new set of characters to replace the old ones, or making a new set of characters for the story revolves around, I'm a bit hesitant.<br>
<br>
Grant it, I'd see it either way, I love going to the movies, even the bad ones.  I'd be willing to give it a chance either way, but I'm not sure how many people would be willing to not give Lucas flack over it.  Some fans tend to go overboard ><<br>

<br>
To understand what Lucas means by <i>balance</i> you must first understand that he openly promotes basic Buddhist doctrine in all Star Wars Episodes. Here is what the Venerable Sumedho Bhikku says about balance:<br>
<br>
<i>"When there is sila, there is emotional balance and we feel at peace. Because we don't hurt or steal or lie, there are no regrets, we are not guilt ridden, and there is a feeling of calm, equanimity, and humility. [...] With effort, mindfulness and concentration, the passive and active are in balance. [...]Once you know what it means to be in balance, then it's no problem - you can walk, you can run, you can twirl around, you can leap."</i><br>
<br>
The "balance in the force" is nothing more than the <i>liberation of the force</i> from the dark side. Anakin brings that liberation through the death of the Emperor. It is not a balance of numbers being spoken of. hehehe <p><center><font face="arial" color="CCFFFF">Lurikeen Mali'Kyre</FONT></center><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='Necromancer'><font size=2 color="red" face="arial"><i>NECROMANCER</span></td></tr></table></font></i></center><center><font face=arial></center><center><I>"My eyes will pierce your soul, then I will take your life!"</I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uthrasy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thrasy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cachelaw.com/~bhadfield/leafpic.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#E9D756>(5/21/02 9:42:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3334.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance</span><hr size=1> Guildon, man, after reading your post it seems clear to me that you think _you_ have a better idea about what Star Wars is and how it should be than Lucas. When you've made four (heading toward five) movies in one franchise that have landed top twenty all time box office (two of which are top four), I'll give you a listen.<br>
<br>
I say good for George.  This is apparently the movie he wanted to make and he'll weave it all into the movies he has already made.  Millions of people will give him millions of dollars because he is a creative genious.<br>
<br>
My one problem with AotC is that I always envisioned a passionate love between anakin and the twins' mom.  Apparently Lucas didn't share my view.<br>
<br>
&quot;D&quot; movie though?  Come on... the show is classic star wars.  Since when have these films been more than action/fun/rides with dark interludes and cliche dialog accompanied by rare to occassionally brilliant acting in bizarre new worlds.<br>

I was simply point out things that I found to lack credibility. Maybe I have become too jaded. I'm not dismissing that possibility, but every person I was with was extremely disappointed with the movie, and they were older than I. Perhpas it is a generational thing. Like I said I don't identify with Anakin Skywalker in the movie. Maybe you do and that's why the movie works for you.<br>
<br>
Sure he's made a lot of money but this movie won't make as much as Phantom Menace and basing the quality of the film on how much money it takes in can be a dangerous habit. Episode rode the coat tails on the Episodes 4-6, but on its own it's a mediocre movie.<br>
<br>
I hated this film because it has 1/1000 the passion, charisma, and charm of the original films. Just because it has Star Wars attached to it doesn't automatically make it good.<br>

<br>
Episodes 4-6 had character development and had the action slowed down. They were much more focused and reflective. Where in episodes 1 or 2 does the movie spend time assessing the realtionship between OBi Wan and Anakin. ll we see is bickering but we never see the long introspective Jedi &quot;chats&quot; like we do in every other Stars movie. These &quot;chats&quot; serve to set up the relationships between characters. In AotC everything is rushed and you don't get to know any of the characters. Why not slow things down a bit lengthen the movie and add some deep discussion. <br>
