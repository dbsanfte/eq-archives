<br>
let me start off by telling you the real story...in detail...although it's been a while(i wasn't aware of this thread), and i don't remember all the names, i will try to tell as much as i can...<br>
<br>
i was playing mallar when my boy steve gives me a tell and says hes getting shafted at frenz camp...he was about level 40 at the time...he said the other 2 people he was camping it with said he was to low of a level to be able to loot fbss's, and said that 3 dropped and the other 2 people took all 3(someone's alt? i can't quite remember)...now these 3 fbss's didnt drop right in a row, so it was some time inbetween the first tell, where i told him to tell his group that they werent being fair, and the last tell, upon which i decided to take action...at that time i got a port to lguk, came down to frenz and took over the camp...i made hte other 2 people apologize while taking one of the rounds of spawns, no frenz...then the cleric decided to tell me that she, yes, a high elf cleric, would rejoin scubar and a monk from scubars current guild(voe) and said about 10 times that no matter what scubar had the next  fbss...or at least tried to tell me...she was dyslexic(she told me when i said i could hardly understand her)...dibobr or something like that was the monks name..he was level 45 at the time....so i said ok, invis'd and went semi afk while the next round came and no frenz...i wanted to go back to xping and scubar said he would give me a tell if something happened so i left...approx 2 hours later i get a tell from scubar saying fbss dropped and he got it but he had to go for dinner..i said grats and said id call him...so he logged and i called him...we talked for about 10 mins and he said he was logging back on so we hung up...he logged back on and the next thing i know him and 3 others are giving me tells that scubar ninja'd the fbss...i didnt really feel like arguing through tells so i came and said that the old cleric agreed to scubar getting the next fbss and that she told me she told the new group members the rules as they came in(i thought i remembered there being loot rules at pre 50 levels? guess not)...they said i was full of bs so after about 10 mins of constant arguing i gave up and told scubar to log....it was about 4 days tsraight that i told scubar to put all of the people that were pestering him(yes, 4 days later everyone was stil on his balls) on ignore...however, one pathological liar named qundi &quot;didn't seem like an ahole&quot; to scubar and he didn't put him on ignore...it was about a week after that i decided to give qundi a tell because he was still trying to get the fbss from scubar...he then went on and on to me about how he is a priest, a lawyer, makes 90,000$ a month and some other crap that had me on the floor for 10 minutes straight...anyways, he wouldn't stfu to i put him on ignore, drove to scubars house and put qundi on ignore on his computer to...case solved, right!? nah...then we got this other chump named aamadar, who is the biggest loot whore i've ever seen...<br>
<br>
new situation..hate raid about 3 weeks ago...i'm one of only 2 enchanters, the other being level 51 at the time...so i was on clarity, haste and ended up mezzing almost all the mobs as well as the other enc had never been to hate before...if you dont get what im saying, i was goddam tired towards the end...however thats when this incident occured...there had been about 5 clerics in all..4 normal ones(including aamadar) and 1 just rotating in...about 25 minutes after that 1 cleric rotated in cleric legs drop...previously, all other 4 clerics had gotten something...1 cleric got arms, 1 gloves and 2 shields(1 shield to aamadar)...so the new cleric was told to loot the legs by EVERYONE...let me emphasize the EVERYONE in that sentence...5 seconds after that aamadar says /ooc WTF! i didnt get to roll on the legs!...i guess at level 52 he still hadnt heard of loot rules...so everyone told him to stfu or leave and he decided to stay...during all the stfu's, and due to myself being tired, i added in a little &quot;aamadar stfu, you already got something and it was now this clerics turn, damn loot whore&quot; in ooc...i guess this made him mad because he told me after the raid that he would never group with me or some shit so i added him to ignore...<br>
<br>
<br>
i know this was long, but if you got to here then hteres only a little bit further to go...<br>
<br>
real flames: aamadar, syng andqundi need to grab the 18&quot; dicks shoved so far up their ass that they walk like a monkey and learn how to play the game fair...and as you start to walk more and more erect hopefully you will start to understand what harassment is(qundi being a lawyer should know this) and how that instead of believing 3 people(scubar, the monk and myself) that loot rules WERE set they had to involve 6 different GMs(all telling qundi to stfu to), scubars guild leader and do all the shit they did to him....<br>
<br>
now as for kidin..you said that he constantly loots all the corpses...but you said he did this moons ago? well hes only level 46 now, so moons ago would be what? level 28? 30? what do the mobs have at that level, 2pp? if you need 50pp(25 damn corpses, groups that level last like 10 kills) so bad then just ask me and i will give it to you...actually i wont anymore, but i would have...<br>

<br>
later<br>

GET OFF Aamadar.  You said yourself the previous person was dyslexic and you had a hard time understanding her.  Chances are.. English is just far from her native tongue.<br>
<br>
Second.. where in the hell do you get off telling an incoming group who gets what?  Since he's your boy it gives you a right to dictate ownership of dropped loot?  I think not.  Have a right to get up the first group's butts?  By all means... but dont go dictating to an incoming group because your boy got screwed by his previous group.  It's sad it happened... has nothing to do with new people camping Frenzy.<br>
<br>
If I'm in a group and we get common loots, and a nice item drops.. everyone that wants it rolls.  Unless, definite NBG policy or some other has been set.<br>
<br>
I've seen examples of Aamadar's character and it's always been shining.  So please dont turn this into a personal attack on him.  I dont think his guild would have kicked him out and returned the item without good proof.<br>

If there is a group of people camping Frenzy, they all deserve a roll on it.  If you wished to keep control of the camp, I suggest you stay at the camp.  I dont think controlling a camp by proxy works too well.  Plus, apparently he agreed to roll for it with the new group, lost, and looted it anyways.<br>
<br>
#2  If someone ninjad from something I was camping, I'd harrass the hell out of them too.  You do something like that, you deserve to get your ass ripped.<br>
<br>
#3  You dont know me (as far as I know) and no I wasn't involved in the incident.  I'm putting forth my 1/2 cp worth as anyone allowed on these boards is welcome to do.<br>
<br>
#4  I dont know anything about VoE, nor anyone in their guild.  So I cannot make a comment on that one.  Aamadar is not a member of VoE if that is your belief.<br>

I've got balls of my own.. keep yours to yourself.. I'm sure you're used to it.<br>

<br>
In a raid, there is one default rule under which everything else lies.  You do what the leadership staff says.  You don't fight a mob unless the main assist tells you.  You don't move away from camp unless raid leader tells you.  And you don't take a no-drop off a mob (even the Prismatic Shield which is largely considered PoS by raiders anyway) unless the loot distributor tells you to.  There is no democracy in a raid, it is a tyranny.  If it is not a benign one, you never raid with them again, but until that point, when you joined the wiz group in SoRo, you agreed to follow a certain raid leader.  So you follow them.<br>
<br>
Remember this and you'll find raiding a lot more enjoyable (except for the times you really don't like the style/rules of a raid leader, in which case you just grit your teeth and ride it out until its done).  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Salenie Mithrilweaver<BR>Proud Member of <a href=" http://www.clanbattleaxe.com">Clan Battle Axe</a><BR>Ally of Vivix Protectorate<BR>Koada'dal, Magician, Grandmaster Smith, and Master of All Languages<BR>RL life pending...</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrscammeralert>Scammer Alert</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
