I really don't think you are reading what I am saying.<br>
<br>
Did I think it was GOOD that we pulled over you? NO! Would I have rather that we had managed to be there when VS was somehow all alone? YES!<br>
<br>
IS THAT EVER GOING TO HAPPEN IF THE GUILDS IN THE ROTATION DON'T COOPERATE?  NO!!!!<br>
<br>
After months of being told to fuck off and checking the spawn to see that VS was offed like clockwork, we got word that a new guild had tried and failed to do VS.  We assumed that this was a free spawn and mustered forces.  We arrive and see that there are now two crews on site.  We could have backed down and basically admitted that we are NEVER getting VS (since &quot;the rotation&quot; gave us no chance) or we could say &quot;you know what, may the most ready crew get him&quot;.<br>
<br>
If your crew of 15 had, in fact, dropped him after pulling away Koryos initial pull, you'd all be laughing your asses off at us and would return back to the &quot;you're never getting in&quot; policy, I am quite sure.<br>
<br>
If you don't want people getting frustrated and pulling over you, then try to be nice and WORK with people who would LIKE to give VS a shot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1623<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 12:48:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> Small point.<br>
<br>
''get there earlier than those other guilds! ''<br>
<br>
UI did get there earlier, sat in the room buffing usually means you are kinda prepping to kill him.<br>
<br>
Also i dont see many people flaming Magister for 'being' Magister, all that shit is dead and buried really, most of the people in SF, Aff, MS, UI etc have longstanding friends in Magister and there has been a 'mostly' excellant dialogue over spawns between these guilds for a while now.<br>
<br>
Sure there is the occaisional clash of heads but it usually starts with a miscommunication and the details get blurred very quick.<br>
<br>
For me, i just know too many good people in Magister to slam the guild as a whole for what happened with VS.<br>
<br>
Laoke summed up the known and agree methods for rotations well but just to clarify:<br>
<br>
If the guild whose turn it is (UI in this case) is not ready and the mob pops then another guild can attempt to prove thewir right to get on the rotation by killing said mob.<br>
<br>
Yesterday Legion of Fate tried 3 or 4 times to do this, and while they were doing it UI people were told of the fact (including tells to me from people in KC) and the opinion in UI guildsay was that we doubted they could take VS but if they did, well good for them.  That is after all, the only way they can get on the rotation other than having another guild step aside for them.<br>
<br>
So UI having sat by and let another guild (LoF) attempt VS with no bitching or interference, then assemble in front of VS and prepare buffing only to have Koryo run in (paraphrased here), declare he was pulling VS and then basically train it through the assembled Ui people who were not yet ready.<br>
<br>
That is not how you get a mob and Koryo is fully aware of the 'gentlemens agreement' in place for these mobs.<br>
<br>
Koryo why did you not just ask Kaane if you could have the staff if it dropped and save all this trouble?  i do sympathise that it sucks to need an epic part from VS when you are no longer on the rotation and that you had probably asked 'some' guilds but in all honesty, do you really think this was the right way to do it?<br>
<br>
This kind of thing can set a bad precedent and you have to remember that there are 4-5 guilds of 'equal' power on E.Marr now, what you do today to X guild then Y guild will do to you tomorrow.<br>
<br>
A simple apology from Koryo and handing over the leg armour to Kaane (as promised) would kill this issue dead i think.<br>

They bet someone else.  Honestly, why go to the trouble of having a rotation if it means you've got to time VS and be there as soon as he pops?<br>
<br>
  Depending on WHEN VS pops it can be up to 12 hours before SF will have a force in place to take him.  I can't speak for the other guilds, but we certainly don't sit there with our stop watches waiting for that handbag to pop.<br>
<br>
  As for contacting SF, ask any member on about rotations and they'll pass you to Nyllith, Saaril or Yenom typically.  Possibly Rimmuk if he's not drunk in a ditch somewhere : ).  Or you could ask on our public board about such matters... wouldn't be the first time someones done so.<br>
<br>
  And I ask you this:  why the hell WOULDN'T we let Magister in?  We -know- what you're capable of.  We don't want to go back to the days of racing for dragons, or at least I sure as hell don't.  I'm sorry if you got the run around, but if I'd known that Magister was looking for a shot at VS I would have strongly recommended you got your shot because (a) it's fair (b) I have friends in your guild as well and (c)  I don't like this sort of thing happening.<br>
<br>
  Explain to me how keeping Magister off the rotation benefits the guilds in the rotation, and I'll listen.<br>
<br>
  The rotation works ONLY because it's perceived as a fair means of ensuring that everyone gets a shot with minimal benefit.  I have no doubts at all that between Magister, SF, MS and DG we could effectively shut people out of the spawn if we wanted too... I, for one, prefer the more relaxed atmosphere the rotation gives us.<br>
<br>
  OK.  You want in the rotation.  It's fair to say you've got our attention now (Oh, and why the hell didn't you just ask on this message board incidentally?????).  Talk to Yenom or Khael, I believe they've got most of the details on it.  May I assume that you want in on the Trakanon rotation as well?  Be a good idea to check with them on the details for that as well.<br>

One of our rangers parks in KC every day and I often hear in /gui &quot;VS on track.  Who's turn is it now?&quot;<br>

I honestly fail to believe you spent that much time trying to get a chance at VS.  All it takes is asking who's turn it is and asking what time they're planning on taking him.  Then plan to getting your raid force there and taking him out before the guild in the rotation assembles to take him.<br>
<br>
WALKING IN AND PULLING THE MOB WHILE A RAID FORCE IS WITHIN MINUTES OF KILLING IT IS DICK.<br>
<br>
In fact,  Ealan...  When you asked Enaak about the rotation two months ago..IF you asked Enaak about the rotation at all..  UI was still planning on killing him and hadn't even gotten into the rotation yet ourselves.  Which makes me think you didn't ask Enaak at all...  why would you at that point?  Did you ask the Drunken Pirate's too?<br>
<br>
Stop your whining bullshit Magister.  You know what happened today was wrong.  How bout an apology for wasting our time?<br>

It's not like you waited till after a patch and ran and killed VS before anyone was there (which is what you should have done). Instead you just ran right over another guild and are now trying to defend it by saying you had no other way to get VS, that is bullshit.

We have been trying that route and, of course, he is never up/there is always a guild prepped.  How much time can one honestly expect their guildmembers to devote to &quot;camping&quot; a spawn that is already spoken for by definition?  Wouldn't it be a LITTLE easier for a guild IN the rotation to ALLOW someone a shot????<br>
<br>
To tell you the truth, I believe we would have NEVER found VS up and that the ONLY reason we did this time is because, as Mitch said, there was no firm belief that the guild attempting the &quot;KS&quot; would get him.<br>
<br>
You may choose not to believe me, but in all honestly we were NOT trying to KS UI.  I honestly assumed that VS was open after the other guild had failed and that is why we were there.  Maybe things went wrong once we got there, but I really dont think that anyone can truly argue that all is right and fair with this system.<br>

Kaasia, I didnt say that I asked KAANE two months ago, I said that I asked him.  It WAS a while ago, but I DID ask him.  I really don't expect you to believe me because, as you pointed out, I am your enemy.<br>
<br>
I HAVE been asking *around* for two months, however, and if everyone was as friendly and open and happy as they make themselves appear, this situation could never possibly have happened.  Any impartial observer, I am sure, would at least see that much.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I do apologize for running over you guys and causing you stress.  That is NOT how I wanted to wind up with an epic piece.  If I had thought that UI was showing up for their regular turn, I would have NOT felt that we should be there.  Have we ever been there before?  Think logically on this.  I have been asking around to try to get in the right way.  Why the hell would I then decide to KS?<br>
<br>
I was told &quot;you have to KS your way in&quot;.  Then we hear that the spawn is open because some unknown guild failed.<br>
<br>
Once we were on site and in the heat of the moment, things got fucked up and for that I do apologize.<br>
<br>
Of course I believe that certain people owe *me* an apology for telling me to fuck off (and Ana as well), but I am quite sure I will never get it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umitchtheblonde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mitch The Blonde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1624<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 1:07:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> Ealan,<br>

Ignoring the majority of that statement and giving you total 100% benefit of the doubt........would you not agree that if UI had been asked if you could loot the staff (if it dropped), then you would have been told &lt;yes Ealan&gt; and then UI would have killed VS, got legs and been happy, You would have got your staff and been happy.

What is your beef man?  What is your spin on this?  You think that I woke up today and said &quot;we are KSing VS from UI, lets go&quot; and we went and did it?<br>
<br>
What the fuck have I done to you for you to take that viewpoint? <br>
<br>
Here is one right back at you.  The system has worked for nine months because in nine months there hasn't been a guild that people ACTIVELY did NOT want in.<br>
<br>
I was literally told &quot;I think you guys wanting back in will be a problem man.  You promised to not do VS ever again&quot;<br>
<br>
On the topic of just being in on a staff I got &quot;heh, why do you think we are doing VS?  We only need the staves too&quot;<br>
<br>
So continue to think that everything is perfect and I am an asshole because you really don't know me at all and so it's hard for me to place too much credit in your assesment of this situation... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udinuvenstratocaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dinuven Stratocaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 1:10:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> Something occurred to me. I used to have a friend who went through a similiar experience with his guild. This friend KSed my guildmembers and I to get into a certain rotation. I was so pissed at him for the longest time and let me just say I feel like total shit now and complete digust with the current system. After experiencing first hand how fustrating it is to get in the rotation with no problems, I had do the exact same thing to get the guild's point across. I see that I shouldn't have been pissed at that individual but be pissed at the general people who made this stupid rule.<br>
<br>
Am I the only one that sees a problem with the current system of KSing to get into a rotation? No matter how you cut it with KSing (timing or whatever) it's still a silly way of handling things. <p>"My songs will split your soul"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 1:14:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> Mitch,<br>

That didn't happen because the situation got out of control.  You might have noticed that I did actually apologize for the way it finally went down.  Of course I will continue to get slammed, people will continue to believe that everything THEY do is 100% right and, some day, this will happen again to someone else (and no, I am not saying US KSing).<br>
<br>
Would UI have let me loot the staff?  Maybe, I honestly do not know the answer to that and we never will.  Given that I have been shown about 0% trust and consideration, though, I wonder exactly how much I am supposed to show in return... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udraekenthehalfling.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Draeken the Halfling</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 1:18:49 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~kljense3/images/MrT/T.gif WIDTH=140 Height=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> what is my spin on this? what is my spin on this you ask?

I don't like seeing people ive been friends with for 2 years get fuk'd just cus someone really wants their epic.  if some other guild other than yours did this then I would be right here posting my points.  <br>
<br>
And its quite obvious that you guys were gonna kill steal venril from UI cus you stated that after 2 monthes of trying there was no other choice!  koryo was even quoted as saying there was no other way!<br>
<br>
And I can guarantee you over the course of people killing VS there have been guilds that did not want other guilds killing it.  Because then there would be less spawns to go after.<br>
<br>
And if you guys promised to not ever do VS then hey thats tuff shit, guess you guys had enough wizards back then.  huge mistake i guess.<br>
<br>
And ya I do know a lil bit about you just from these posts.  First of all you like to get the last word in.  You also are a hypocrite!  And lastly you obviously don't know me!<br>

The rotation is now X guilds long (where X = every guild on Erollisi Marr).<br>
<br>
  If you can tell me a better way to weed out who is capable of taking down VS and who is not, I'm listening.<br>
<br>
  I also find it interesting that Magister wasn't able to get into the VS spawn for 2 months of trying, and yet roughly in that timespan United Independant, Institute and Ring of Destiny (Not to mention the failed attempts by Legion of Fate) managed to get in through EXACTLY the method outlined above.  These are not the guild that Magister is:  Magister has done things that frankly, these guilds just dream of.  They're smaller, less organised as a rule, and not as high level.  Explain to me then why they managed to beat Storm's Fury, or Midnights Sojourn, to VS and Magister can not.<br>
<br>
  It's fairly obvious there's been a communication breakdown somewhere.  That doesn't excuse you ganking VS from UI, for which you -do-, in my opinion owe them an apology.  Especially considering that they have said that they would have given you the staff had you only asked.<br>
<br>
  And, purely because I feel like throwing kerosene on a BBQ to get my steak well done enough... it's a sad, sad day when United Independent looks good.<br>

If you didn't and you pissed around with one of our officers then you are to blame for not getting what you deem to be an answer. I trust Yenom when he said he was not approached, so you DIDN'T ask every guild in the rotation. Hell, we get half of our VS spawns killed by people who want in the rotation and we can't get folks on early enough, you mean to tell me that you couldn't have done the same thing?<br>
<br>
But lets cut to brass tacks. This ain't about the rotation, or you're troubles getting back into it. It's about a group prepping to kill the mob and you pulling the mob past it to kill it. That is screwed up however you want to paint it. And it ain't SF coming to the defense of UI, as anyone knows we don't see eye to eye alot, it's the fact that you casually strolled past a buffing group and stole a spawn. Rationalize it how you want, it still isn't kosher.<br>
<br>
The least you could do is show some balls and apologize like we did when you said we didn't consult you about killing VS back in the day. And that apology was because we logged on earlier and took the spawn with No DK in the zone. We didn;t pull past you and you still got royally pissed. Can you blame UI?<br>

<br>
I have known, and been guilded with, a lot of these people for nearly two years as well...  Don't just read what you want to read, read everything I am writing.  I said that I did NOT want things to work out this way and I apologized for the way they did work out.<br>
<br>
We did NOT set out to KS UI, that's all I can say.  That may be what wound up happening, but mustering in KC, I was assuming an open spawn.<br>
<br>
I do not want to get the last word in, but I also cannot allow myself to be misunderstood and misrepresented.  <br>
<br>
As for us being out of the rotation, I have found that when it works against us, we are &quot;still Da`Kor&quot;, but when it would work in our favor we &quot;aren't Da`Kor any more!&quot;.  Talk about hypocritical!<br>
<br>
I really don't see how I am being a hypocrite here.  I was told in no uncertain terms that we were supposed to KS our way in.  We saw a chance at an open spawn and went for it.  When we got there, things got fucked up and ugly, and for that, I apologize.  To be honest, this epic is not worth this much shit and I would really rather that we had never gotten VS then have this shitstorm happen.  Ask Anastia (or do you hate her too?)  I had told her point blank that I figured on not getting VS after what I had learned of the rotation.  I had actually given up on bothering with VS until I heard today that we had a chance at an open spawn.<br>
<br>
You are pretty vehement in your defense of your friends Drae, and that is generally a good thing, but I think you are unfairly judging what actually happened.<br>
<br>
I realize I don't know you, that was my whole point.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udraekenthehalfling.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Draeken the Halfling</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/15/01 1:29:49 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.sit.wisc.edu/~kljense3/images/MrT/T.gif WIDTH=140 Height=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small problem.</span><hr size=1> How dare you say that Laoke...<br>
