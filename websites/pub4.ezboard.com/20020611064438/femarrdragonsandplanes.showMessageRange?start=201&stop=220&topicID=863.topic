I don't petition anymore because I know no matter how justified I am in asking for help I won't get any and if I do it won't be for another 9 hours when I real GM gets on.<br>
<br>
Here is a post from this morning showing the "knowledge base of the guides" cut and pasted for your amusement:<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>The other day while waiting on people to arrive outside chardok I decided to kill the sarnaks outside (I was super bored). So I charmed a pet caster and proceded to lay waste to the castle. On around my second charmed pet, one of those lag spikes that never happen according to verrant (you know...the ones where the server just stops for a few minuites) hits. During the spike I get the "your charm spell has worn off" message, which struck me as odd since I figured that would be done server-side. Anywho, when the server decided to go to work again, the sarnak was STILL my pet. Strange, I thought. To make a long story short...one hour and a horde of sarnaks later, he was STILL my pet and I had never once recharmed.<br>
<br>
So, this is obviously a bug right? Being the good little enchanter I am, i /bugged it and also sent a petition because I had some questions about it. The guide responds with the usually "hail" wah wah wah stuff, and I tell him about the bug.<br>
<br>
Here is the kicker, his responce to me was....<br>
<br>
"you are very high level, would have most likely had it charmed that long anyway"<br>
<br>
/who all cluelessguide01<br>
(50 enchanter) cluelessguide01 **Guide</i><br>
<br>
I could pull up countless others from many other sources.  But that was one from my limited reading today. I have had confirmed bugs repeatedly denied as bugs until a real GM comes on hours later only to find my rez timer is expired.  I have also received a lowly 49 rez many times for dying during a Verant outage instead of a full exp rez (OK this is verants fault, but your thier representative).<br>
<br>
I have lost all my equip to bugs twice.  Once I was reimbures after 2 WEEKS and the back-up was from a week before the loss READ 3 WEEKS lost.  The other time  was never reimbured because after 9 hours waiting for a guide response I decided it wasn't worth it and just deleted the character.<br>
<br>
So YES I agree there are idiots to deal with and such....but I have dealt with my fair share of bad guides as well to the point I doubt I will ever use /petition again.<br>
<br>
If you hate being a guide so much just quit. Force verant to hire trained staff who knows what they are talking about.  Trust me they make a mint off this product. I crunched the numbers...they can afford more CS staff.  That staff can be rolled onto the next product as people migrate later. <p><p align="center"><font color="666699"><b>Citra 55 Enchanter - </b><i>The Fearless</i><br>

My problem is with one of the guides on Povar ... what happened was I was sittin in this inn (trissa whistlesong spawn..) around level 15 when a Dark Elf came in and wouldnt stop KS'n, as a druid I could maybe manage 1/15 kills, I asked him to share and we could each take a kill and he told me to f*** off and started spamming me, i petitioned and said I'm being spammed and someone keeps KSing me and I can hardly get any kills. Well, half an hour of puttin up with this guys crap later a guide contacts me, he's pretty cool at first until he asks me to wait for a GM to come so that they can warn this guy who was swearing at the GM's. (he was claiming that he should be able to do this since i was a light race and he was a dark race, and that bla bla bla this is BS bla bla bla.. well if he was really role playing he shouldn't be in freeport unless he was on a raid hehe) well anyways after watching them argue for about 20 minutes with no GM showing up yet I said, you know what screw this I'll let you guys duke it out im gonna go somewhere else. WELL, then the guide said I got myself involved and If i left now he had the power to ban me. Being as gullible as I am and thinking him serious I stuck around for 2 goddamn hours watching all this bickering between the guide, the player and the gm (who showed up after like 30-40 minutes) THEN I said screw this I'm leaving, zoned outa freeport to then zone again and find I had been banished to mother friggin EverFrost Peaks for being abusive towards a Guide and GM! I asked them why I was banished and they said I was being abusive because I SWORE at them. I said Screw You guys i'm leaving and got banished to friggin EverFrost (and incase you didnt know, they bind you to your &quot;banishment&quot; spot too, so basically you have to run all the way back). Anyways on my way back I did happen to get killed by a giant that I didnt see in the karanas. But anyways, I messaged that asshole DE later that night and found out he got away scott free after SWEARING AND ARGUING WITH a GM AND GUIDE FOR 2 FRIGGIN HOURS! They simply asked him to try and reach compromises in this type of ordeal later on and left him there. Sorry bout saying that, just figured i'd post my little rant too heh... had to get that off my chest, this was with some alternate character druid I had made... (my original druid was like level 33, but I wanted to just play as a halfling to fool around and made another druid, dont know why I was compelled to do that)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also to Coggin : The best dennis miller rant ever was when he was talking about how 3M had to have a HUGE recall on about 100,000 locks that they made, because two weeks after shipping they learned that there was a way to open them that even children were learning... and then he was like ... this is a company that specializes in the making of FUCKING LOCKS!!! <br>

That's correct. The edit ability is disabled for this forum, since this is a flame &amp; rant forum. People often tend to flame when they're angry and remove it next day because they regret. I hope this makes people think twice before flaming other players. Plus, an empty post (all text edited out by author) with 40 replies looks stupid ;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usolroth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sol Roth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/16/00 3:18:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=863.topic&index=210>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Keep the fire burning!</span><hr size=1> You nailed the camel in the hump.<br>

<br>
That was great!  Tweety, I know how ya feel man!  I am a customer service rep myself, and I did tech/help desk support, and I can't tell you HOW many times I've wanted to say "I'm sorry sir/ma'am, please pack your computer up and send it back with a note telling the company that you are too friggin STUPID to own a computer!"<br>
<br>
Then you have the true idiots:<br>
<br>
Hello, technical support, how may I assist you? <br>
<br>
Your software has done something really weird to my computer! <br>
<br>
May I ask what that is sir? <br>
<br>
Well, every time I try to use it to dial out with my modem I hear the computer speaking at me and well I am starting to worry about my sanity? <br>
<br>
Well sir - do you hear the modem actually dial? <br>
<br>
Oh yes but then there is this muffled female voice <br>
<br>
And what does this voice say to you sir? <br>
<br>
"The number you have dialed is not in service,please hang up and try your call again" <br>
<br>
Let's not forget:<br>
<br>
This was related to me as an actual tale and the tech guy, working for a sizeable firm, was actually fired from his job after the call was listened to by whoever monitors those calls for quality control.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, tech support? I Just got this (model) a week or so ago, and was working tonight and now I can't see the cursor on the screen any more. One minute it was there, and the next minute it was gone.<br>
<br>
Okay, sir. Is your work still onscreen?<br>
<br>
No. that went away too.<br>
<br>
You need to check to see if the cable from the monitor is still plugged securely into the computer.<br>
<br>
(at this point, the tech can hear the caller scoot the chair back and grunt a little as he gets under or behind his desk.)<br>
<br>
It's so hard to see here. I can't tell cause it's so dark.<br>
<br>
Can you turn on another light?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
You can't?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Can you swivel the computer around so you can see the cables in the rear?<br>
<br>
Yeah, but it won't make a difference. I still won't be able to see them.<br>
<br>
Why is that, Sir?<br>
<br>
Cause the lights are all out.<br>
<br>
Can you turn them on?<br>
<br>
No. I told you that.<br>
<br>
Why won't the lights go on?<br>
<br>
Cause the power went out 10 or 15 minutes ago.<br>
<br>
(Lights come on and the tech realizes no one's home.)<br>
<br>
Okay sir, I think i know what's wrong. Do you still have the original boxes that the computer came in?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Well, you need to pack the computer back up and return it to the dealer where you purchased it.<br>
<br>
Well, what do I tell him when I get there?<br>
<br>
Ask him politely to refund your money because you're too stupid to own a computer! (Tech hangs up)<br>
<br>
and last but not least:<br>
<br>
Customer: "Hi. I have a Macintosh. I had a disk that I wanted to put in the computer, but it wouldn't go, so I pushed harder, and it wouldn't go, so I pushed REALLY hard, and now it's making funny noises. I think there was a disk in there already." <br>
Tech Support: "Unplug the computer, now." <br>
Customer: "I don't want to lose my paper!" <br>
Tech Support: "Unplug the computer right now. Your paper is lost. Your floppy drive is lost. If you're lucky the Mac will be OK. Unplug it now." <br>
Customer: "But I don't want to lose my paper!" <br>
After a few more repetitions of this, I heard someone, presumably the client's roommate, scream. Then I heard the dorm fire alarm go off in the background. Those things are awful loud, but she didn't seem interested in unplugging the computer, fleeing the fire in her room, or anything else other than arguing with me. Figuring I was doing her a favor, I hung up. <br>
<br>
All tales courtesy of <a href="http://www.techtales.com">Techtales</a>:)  Point being, no matter what type of customer service you go into, you still have losers...although, I almost became a guide, but now am glad I didn't...<br>
