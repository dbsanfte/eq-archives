<br>
Revenge = You smack me, i smack you, you smack me, i<br>
smack you etc etc.<br>
<br>
Vengeance = You smack me, i smack you, you smack me...i shoot you in the head. No more revenge.<br>
<br>
If you go after a king you must kill him, weve lashed out at terrorists before and they struck back once our guard was lowered. Its not revenge anymore, this ends here, now.<br>
<br>
Sorry for that grim description.<br>
Terrorism will never end, Most we can do is show we will not tolorate it in any size or shape ever again. its the only way for these cowardly &quot;holy&quot; people to mount an attack. They cant hit our military, and dance and cheer at the loss of thousands of innocent lives. And all this in the name of their religion? Which side of allah are you on? The side that says killing American's is the duty given to you by your god? Or the side that condemns these attacks?<br>
<br>
Sheesh.<br>
<br>
America is done playing defense. We are the big dogs here and its time to spearhead the eradication of the last true remaining evil that plagues civilization. There is no more super power countries stirring up trouble like the old Nazi's. Enough level headed people are in power now and a world war between major armies like in past world wars is very unlikely. And if someone were trying to rise to power only to send his army on a rampage or genocide they would be shut down quickly.<br>
Yet, these rogue nations and terrorist organizations like the Taliban that dont have an army, just a group of shady individuals with no regard for human life are able to gain enough power unnoticed to carry out these sorts of sucker punch attacks against innocent, unsuspecting civilians.<br>
Freedom and humanity are under attack and civilization have the right to defend itself. We are the good guys, and always have cherrished the idea of avoiding the loss of innocent people when we do have to enter a conflict. We are more civilized then these cowardly &quot;holy&quot; men, and dont have to stoop to their level to wipe them out. Yes that sounds funny, but its true. Our counterattack should not be a blind rage.<br>
<br>
The song 'Tuesday's Gone' took on a whole new meaning in my mind. Listening to the lyrics, it made me cry as i stared at my desktop picture of the fire fighters raising the American flag above what is left of the WTC. Afterwards this tragedy really sank in, where before i was still in disbelief hoping i would awake from this nightmare. Now my feelings are a mixture of sorrow for the victims and pure inner rage.<br>
<br>
On the news last night they showed some rare footage of an American journalist in the training camp Clinton bombed after the Africa embassy bombings. The &quot;tour leader&quot; being followed by kids wielding AK47's was trying to get a point across, it was hard to understand but kinda came out to this-<br>
 They see death and destruction all around them, they grow up with it. Then they see America, which is so free and cares for the loss of lives, and *gasp* allows people to practice any religion without being shot. For some reason this is bad to them, so they want to give us a taste of their daily life by killing our innocent men and women.<br>
<br>
Again this is just what i interpreted, he may have been talking about his flower garden for all i know...but this is what i made of it.<br>
<br>
Ive never been a very religious person, but i do follow the Christian way of treating people.<br>
You know its gone too far when you BOMB your neighbors all day long because they dont believe in the same god.<br>
<br>
Killing American's = Heaven?<br>
Killing those whos religion differs = Heaven?<br>
Living in freedom, peace, and security = Hell?<br>
wow what a concept for a religion...<br>
<br>
Honestly, im kinda worried about our counterattack. It will either result in a severe hammerblow to anyone posing a threat to civilization, or it will unleash the real terror Bin Laden is capable of. Assuming he is the mastermind behind the attacks. Believe me, taking over planes to use as weapons isnt the biggest thing he can throw at us. If he really wanted to do serious destruction, dont get me wrong, this is VERY serious destruction already, but far from what hes capable of doing. This was an attack geared at casualties, breakdown of financial stability, and American spirit. Buying tickets to stroll onto our planes only to use them as guided missles, and doing it with such ease is a terrible blow to American spirit and feeling of safety.<br>
Now lets assume he was after mass casualties, chemicals in subway systems or some such act would be more effecient.<br>
As if the loss of life isnt hard to take in already.<br>
<br>
Lets only hope our counterstrike doesnt wield consequences such as this. God help us if it does.<br>
<br>
Heart felt sorrow for the victims and their families, they did not deserve this. No one does.<br>
My salutes to all those rescue men and women that gave their lives trying to save others. And to those working round the clock to the point of exhaustion trying to keep hope alive that more survivers are yet to be found. To the brave men aboard the 4th plane that apparently tried to overtake the plane ultimately for it to crash short of its intended target, the alternative would have been considerably worse. To the congress finally working together to put the President in full command, and to all our allies showing support in the beginning of this new war, the war for Freedom.<br>
<br>
&quot;May god have mercy on you, cause we sure wont.&quot;<br>

NEW- I hear there is hard evidence linking Bin Laden to the attacks, and that hes already in hiding. This is his usual pattern. He comes on TV, strikes, then hides like a coward.<br>
If so Afghanistan is in deep shit as well.<br>
Now were recieving threats if we counterattack, why threaten to attack back if youre not guilty? Lied from the start, and they will be held just as responsible as bin Laden himself. We know who did it, and in the end if he didnt...darn hes still a threat to civilization and should have been wiped out long ago.<br>
<br>

<br>
I doubt Bin Laden could pull off another sizable event in the next month or two.  Terrorists don't have infinite resources, and their plans are usually meticulously laid and surprising.<br>
<br>
I'm more worried about the political repercussions of what it's going to take to get Bin Laden and anybody else involved out.<br>

<br>
1) Our guard is lowered and they strike.<br>
<br>
2) Massive investigation turns up those responsible- Bin Laden and harboring country.<br>
<br>
3) We counterstrike.<br>
<br>
4) The terrorists hiding out in the US use whatever resources they have to kill more innocent lives.<br>
Bin Laden is extremely wealthy, and neighboring countries would be glad to sell him technology, from communication devices to weapons of mass destruction. I believe hes proven his willingness to kill innocent people, and send his own men to die. He wont hesitate to do it again.<br>
<br>
You do have a good point though /agree<br>

Bin Laden is not the only terrorist, nor can he exist in a vacuum.  <br>
<br>
States other than Afghanistan harbor and encourage terrorism against the US.  If we lack the will to pursue these other govornments and terrorist groups, and to stand up to the consequences of going up against them (they may find allies) then we should do nothing. <br>
<br>
Ineffectually churning up some rocks and already bombed-out buildings in Afghanistan, a country that has been in some kind of war or civil war for over 23 years now, will do absolutely nothing.  <br>
<br>
Killing Bin Laden alone will do absolutely nothing.  They will simply replace him, and he will be a martyr.<br>
<br>
If he is able to evade us, we will look even more foolish and ineffective.<br>
<br>
In fact, If I were an islamic terrorist, thats exactly what I would expect the US to do.  In the longer run, a few years out when the next terrorist strikes, it would only show how ineffectual and paralyzed our political system is in dealing with deceptive terrorist organizations and govornments.  How easily the average person is manupulated, and the humanistic values of American society are played upon.<br>
<br>
And for those that think 'force' has not worked - think again.  Unbridled war worked in WW II, WW I, the civil war, and many many wars prior.  The recent examples of 'Limited War' and appeasement is what has been proven over and over to fail horribly - in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq.  Restrained use of force has a very poor chance of success.<br>
<br>
 In the Middle ages, a group of terrorists called 'Assasins' terrorized muslim and christians alike for nearly 200 years.  They were not defeated until the Mongols rode over them (and everyone else), leveled their homes and eradicated the villages and cities they drew support from.  <br>
<br>
I really don't think that as a whole, the US is prepared to go to all out war.  I don't think we are willing to stand up to countries that proffer their assistance on TV, but in reality give none, while behind the scenes they protect and aid groups like Bin Laden's.   If Bush makes a move against such countries, I suspect his support here and abroad will peel away.  I will support it, but it sounds like a significant number of others will not.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid it will take something much worse than the WTC to truly wake up Americans.<br>
