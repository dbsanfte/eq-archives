Not uncommon, I'm pretty used to it. Not many clerics hang out in that part of the world, and you do end up with some higher end folks hunting the giants. One was even as I was about to zone into BB asking for a rez in perma, so I gated back to SafeHall, ran to zone, rezzed, and started the run over. One zone isn't so bad you can't do it over. *shrugs*<br>
<br>
I really and truly don't mind stuff like that.<br>
<br>
But then, on that second pass through, I'd decided to hook up with some friends, and so was on my way to the NK area. As I ran down into BB, there were two naked looking barbarians running down the tunnel, being chased by 3 gnolls. I nuked two of them, buffed the barb that was standing there trying to fight, and ran off after giving him a heal that should have more than taken care of him considering the buffs I tossed on him.<br>
<br>
Apparently what I didn't notice was the other barb with him got dropped by the gnolls. I was zoning into WK as I got the tell from his friend "Can I have a rez?"<br>
<br>
Once in WK, I made the quick spot assesement of my situation. Meeting with friends, rez request. I do a /who all soandso, and see that he's 5th level. Now I like to help out as much as the next guy, But I'm not going to turn back around and run BACK through 2 zones just to rez a 5th level person. I'm sorry. It's just not going to happen. If I had been right there and saw his body? I would have revived him or something. I honestly thought he had just high tailed it to the zone and zoned.<br>
<br>
So I send back that I'm already 2 zones away and that he'll need to run back to BB himself, that I'm sorry......<br>

[Mon Apr 23 22:42:06 2001] [5 Shaman] xxxxx (Barbarian) ZONE: everfrost<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:42:39 2001] You told xxxxx, 'I'm sorry, I can't. I gotta move to get somewhere, and its not that far of a run from where you are'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:43:07 2001] xxxxx tells you, 'i cant find my way and i will get jumped agian i cant see in the tunnel'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:43:31 2001] xxxxx tells you, 'plz'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:43:52 2001] You told xxxxx, 'I'm sorry, I can't.'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:43:57 2001] xxxxx tells you, 'why?'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:44:15 2001] xxxxx tells you, 'i will get jumped as soon as i get near'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:44:17 2001] You told xxxxx, 'because I'm already 2 zones away :p and omw to meet someone'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:44:29 2001] You told xxxxx, 'then perhaps you should wait til you're a higher level before going to blackburrow'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:44:54 2001] xxxxx tells you, 'my body is inside and i only have a short time to get it'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:45:42 2001] You told xxxxx, 'I am sorry for that. But I can not help you'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:48:47 2001] xxxxx tells you, 'thanks alot'<br>

[Mon Apr 23 22:49:21 2001] xxxxx tells you, 'my body probably gone'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:49:29 2001] You told xxxxx, 'that isn't my problem NOR is it my fault'<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:49:37 2001] You told xxxxx, 'And perhaps if you'd spent more time running to get it, rather than expecting ME to run and get it FOR YOU, you might have gotten it. Something to ponder.<br>
[Mon Apr 23 22:49:41 2001] You told xxxxx, 'but have a lovely day anyway'<br>
<br>
Day in, Day out, I can see how some clerics just stop replying to rez requests. It gets very tiring to continually have someone else's death and xp loss become some psycho guilt trip and "your" fault. Am I sorry that Barbie died? Yes. Do I wish I had seen him fall earlier so I might have been of more assistance? Yes. Am I going to run back two zones, then run back to where I was for a person who is feeding me a line about their death being my responsibility/fault? Don't count on it.<br>
<br>
One more thing -<br>

Now that day (Celestea mentioned) I zoned out of the Tower in iceclad, excepted I lagged and I was at full health when I left the tower and was at half a bub when i came out, sow didn't matter I was ran down within a few seconds. I was kind of mad I lost my lvl etc....... I explained this to the the cleric that just zoned out of the Tower... he ignored me..... I sent another tell... did a who all cleric 49 60 again and he was in EC... SO SHUT UP THAT IS BEING A JERK. </i><br>
<br>
So in the space of a few minutes he got from Tower to EC? Did you ever stop to consider he might have been porting with someone and never seen your original tell (there is a lag time when you are zoning in where tells go through but you don't see them) and that *gasp* he may have never even really noticed your body? He obviously didn't get to Ecommons that fast by running/the boat, so it's not like he just leisurely strolled around your corpse for an hour laughing at you.. As much as we forget, this game isn't about "ME ME ME" to anyone but us....and that fact doesn't make anyone a jerk. It's just the way the cards fall some days.<br>
<br>
**note, I took the Barb's name out of the log because a side effect of my rant the other day was that the druid who was the focus of it was suddenly in a new guild two days later, and I have this weird bit of guilt that somehow my rant caused that, something I had not intended. I was just blowing steam, not looking to get her axed from something. So in the future, I'll most likely be removing names from rants.<br>
