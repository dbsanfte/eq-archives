<br>
but...<br>
<br>
At a minimum, keep out of rants and raves and don't delete the &quot;bad&quot; posts, move them to another forum where the public can see them if they wish but deleting them can, and does, cause a problem.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is pretty much how I feel about the situation also. I hardly ever post on these boards, but I've read them daily for almost a year now. That's just how I am, I'm a quiet person in general.<br>
<br>
But if I ever wanted to speak my mind about something/someone, I don't wanna have to watch everything I say, and wonder if x mod will edit/delete my post, that's just bullshit.<br>
<br>
The big problem with having a Personal Attack/Flame Policy is the mods bias. Example: Post A could be deleted by a mod, but post B could be just as bad as post A and go untouched, because the mod likes the person who posted post B better than the person who posted post A.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't like any Personal Attack or Flame rules.<br>
Although, I do feel that some rules are needed for the &quot;normal&quot; forums, but only in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> extreme</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cases. I see no reason why the R&amp;R/SL forums need to be moderated for anything but the things that EZBoards won't allow. <br>

Someone goes too far, usually the next few posts let them know they did.<br>
<br>
However, I'd be an idiot if I thought this would always work.  I hadn't realized that it bothered people so much so that they would email a moderator complaining.  I certainly don't want people run off because of some asshole.  So, although I hate it, I will recognize the need for a personal attack policy.  Like most have said, the Rants and Raves section should be clear of this.  <br>
<br>
As far as instances, where someone completely hijacks a thread in other forums with a personal attack, post should be deleted, and poster should be told to move their rant to R&amp;R. So even if it was questionable as to whether or not the post was a personal attack, the poster has the option of continuing in the other forum, and thus getting what they wanted to say off their chest. <br>
<br>
Often times, these flames come from something said in the thread, and thus are justifiably placed in the same thread. What to do in this instance, I don't know, that'd be something to discuss.  <br>
<br>
The very fact that this policy is under review shows how good our moderators are.  And I'd like to take a moment to kiss their ass <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and say, thanks. <br>

I read Tarot's message (took a while, heh) before work and thought about it on the way in.  I also read Venen's message and skimmed the rest.  I couldn't agree more.  I can't say just how much I'd prefer people to be moderate themselves, but the reality of the situation is that it's just not gonna happen.<br>

You have posted this thread looking for opinions. Well, here is mine.<br>
<br>
I, like most players (but not the few board hacks, many of whom are retired), play EQ for fun. We come to these boards to communicate with other players/characters, regarding the game we play for fun, and wish to do so in a friendly atmosphere. When speaking in ooc, we do so largely politely and expect the same in return, to be able to take part in essentially civil discussions. Most of us are adults, or at least, wish to be treated like them. Yes, some debates get hot and sometimes anger is shown, this is to be human.<br>
<br>
But there has to be a line somewhere. Most would not debate that if child porn were posted here, it should be immediately deleted and the poster banned (at the very least). But the line is fuzzy .. what about bashing those of another religion or nationality? Or using language that is designed to cause offence by its very nature to those of another culture or set of beliefs? It is a GREY line, and there is no 'right' place to put it, there are only differing opinions.<br>
<br>
Tarot walks a tightrope (as any moderator does), and walks it well. Personally, I would be more strict, as I find obscene language offensive, and would ban those who insist on using it, and I would ignore/overrule those who whine about 'censorship' and 'free speech; I would use Tarot's &quot;Not in my house!&quot; approach. But then again, I'd not want to moderate a community like this, and I know Tarot will be criticized by the malcontents whatever she does.<br>
<br>
Of course, whatever policy is adopted, it must be consistant and treat all posters the same, but I don't think anyone would disagree with that.<br>
<br>
This same issue was discussed recently on the Firiona Vie boards, and the moderator there has taken a firmer line; you can link to it from my sig if you wish to look at their rules (for reference only).<br>
<br>
My view? We enforce the 'no personal attacks' policy, and those who cannot communicate without constantly speaking like street vermin or launching personal attacks on others should be (after whatever warning system is put in place) banned from the boards. If they want a 'free community' with none of what they call censorship, they can reform 'Free Lanys' (and the silent majority who just want a friendly place to communicate will just not go there). My way of looking at it would be ... if Verant would not allow it in-game, there is no reason why the community here should have to put up with it on the boards.<br>
<br>
The same rules should be applied to all forums. We have minors and people from all countries and cultures and backgrounds who visit here, and moderation should be based on the harm that can be done to any of our visitors. In short, this board is not a free-for-all, and should not become one, or I forsee it being abandoned by more and more of the normal folks and taken over by the few trolls and board hacks, and those who would refuse to be pushed away by such.<br>
<br>
This board does not 'belong' to those few. It belongs to everyone. And not everyone wants to read this kind of thing mixed into otherwise informative or communicative threads.<br>
<br>
One final point. If for some reason a forum is created, or an existing one is used, that has no rules of acceptable behaviour, I would very much hope not to have to have otherwise decent threads put on the other forums forcibly moved to such a forum (which I would not wish to visit) all because one repulsive person turns the thread into a personal attack on someone or similar; better that the offensive post is merely deleted and the poster warned. Personally, I want a 'Rants and Raves' forum that still has basic rules of civility enforced upon it, where I can still 'rant' or 'rave' without launching vile personal attacks on others, or having to endure it from others.<br>

<br>
However, I don't agree with banning people from these boards unless it's under VERY extreme circumstances.  Therefore, my ideal policy would just include suspension for a week for each instance over the third warning.  That's enough to get people to think twice about what they're saying (a week without these boards would drive me nuts) and yet not threaten them to the point of making it a "challenge" to get banned and come back if you're a troublemaker, or to completely disassociate ourselves from someone who might be a good person, but who's a little too snippy sometimes. <p><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig2.jpg><br>

While the &quot;average&quot; poster on these message boards is very capable of moderating themselves, we're not talking about those people.  But rather the 1% to 5% of the populace who gets a perverse thrill from the attentioned received in flame wars.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I don't want to open a thread which may contain some interesting content, to find that 80% of the posts are flames between a few people.  Am I lazy?  Yes.  Do I appreciate all the unpaid/thankless work that the moderators do to clean this sort of thing up?  Yes.<br>

It's not applied fairly, not saying any names I just sit by and watch and see things that are of the exact same level of someone else's &quot;personal attack&quot; that just stay, and never have anything else said about it.<br>
<br>
Issue 2: Rants and Raves. By description is a &quot;general bitch board&quot; as the description says on the main page.<br>
<br>
Issue 3: Some people start shit just because they like to piss people off. Simply put e-mail them, tell them it's not gonna cut it anymore and if they want to continue doing it ban their asses.<br>
<br>
Last thing, no one on this board is anymore important than anyone else. If your going to moderate then you can't allow &quot;Friend A&quot; to do the exact same things as &quot;Average Joe A&quot; and ban &quot;Average Joe A&quot; and not ban &quot;Friend A.&quot;<br>
<br>
Have the balls to stand by what you say.(This isn't for just the mods.)<br>
