Brutas, sorry I missed your post somehow. I think you have made an interesting point. I would like to add that there are 3 types of relationships you have included in your post. 1) Logical relationships: If A = B and B = C, then A = C; 2) Physical relationships: A bumps into B; 3) Pyschological relationships: A loves B. Some argue that 2 and 3 really are the same. At any rate, *relationships* come to play in Metaphysics when talking about 1 and 2 above, and I think rarely 3. If A loves B, then there is no question that A has some sort of logical or physical relationship with B. Now which is more important than the other? I think that 3 wins hands down. I could really care less if the world is another's dream (an illusion), or the figment of my imagination (Solipsism) or ultimately physical. To me emotion is very powerful and is what counts day to day. When I die I will not be asking if the world is real. I will be asking for those people I love be they imaginary or real. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

I completely agree.  However, its probably that we might call it two or three different things.  Personally, I believe that 'true' perception or 'oneness' if you will, is a result of the union of love and truth, and once this union is thouroughly achieved, (this is only a theory) We move on towards the next step which is a union with God(a kind of 'bond' if you will) [I know that sounds a bit backwards from the 'Christianity' thing, whereby people think the only thing important in life is to make sure you are 'saved'].  Yes I believe in afterlife.  I believe in God.  I believe that I'm cool with him and all that.  I believe I am 'saved'.  BUT, I want more out of my life and relationship/union with God.  While the union of this relatioship is 'key' IMO, I continually work to understand.  I am not a walking zombie and will never be one.  THAT is why I see the beauty in what others say/do.  THERE is more to life than my piddly brain.   Quote Lurikeen-   &quot;Some argue that 2 and 3 really are the same&quot;   I COMPLETELY agree.  Here is how I see that statement:  Love=1 Truth=2 and spirituality=3.  Love is obvious and so is Truth.   Spirituality(IMO), as the 'union' of these two, travels beyond, or transcends the 'ignorance of 'love' and the arrogance of 'truth'.  PLEASE allow me to explain that in simple terms.  Truth, without love is arrogant.  Love without truth is ignorant.  There is a 'necassary' balance between the two.  This 'perfect' balance is spirituality.  <br>
     Now, that statement, definetly asks this so-called term, 'perfection', to tear it to pieces.  BUT IMO, perfection is not a judgement of truth(thought, whatever ya call it) as most people percieve it to be.  THIS is the temptation of our 'scientific' revolution.  I think science is wonderful and believe that it is a necassary component of our evolution(that word not meant physically).

What am I saying about &quot;existence&quot;? Not much really. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Let me seperate out two ideas I have and please knock them around a bit. There is no such thing as &quot;Existence&quot; in and of itself. There are worlds that contain things (like you and I) and one of those worlds is the *actual* world (btw, a &quot;world&quot; is simply a collection) and all the rest of them are &quot;possible worlds&quot;. What is actual is what is real and what exists. The actual world is that which contains instances of logically possible concepts. For example, the actual world doesn't contain an instance of a &quot;round-square&quot; because that is not possible; in fact, &quot;round-squares&quot; are not even real. However, the concept &quot;human being&quot; does have instances. Human beings are both real and exist. That is to say the concept is coherent and there is an instance of it. Let me toss this out while I am here.... The concept of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; is coherent. So, Sherlock is real, but does he exist? As far as we know there are no instances of the concept anywhere, so the easy answer is he does not exist.<br>
<br>
Concerning the remainder of your post, you have some well thought out ideas. I agree that passion must walk alongside the dryness of truth. I also agree that when one attempts to lose emotional content (what you refer to as &quot;spirituality&quot;) they have lost out. At the end of reason are two types of people, in my opinion: 1) dead ones 2) living one. Those who keep passion in their lives are alive.<br>
<br>
I will not leave aside what you are writing about &quot;perfection&quot; until you can elaborate more on the topic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Yep I completely agree and this is why I feel so strongly about God, Jesus, after life and all that.  People fear God beacuse they think they won't be able to feel.  WHen in fact that would be far from making any sense to a being who has made us with the idea of friendship.  I am not going to be walking around like some zombie creating the perfect marble sphere and farming my lot.  Where is the balance of love and truth there?  There isn't one.  Yep, without feelings what is there to live for.  There would be no free will.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Everything is important.  Everything will be involved.  I believe there are so many enjoyable things in society that have been perverted by people.  People then wonder, &quot;will i be able to fuck my wife in the mouth in heaven?&quot;  well, if sodomizing your wife is a balnce of love and truth then I guess so.  Will it be like sex, drugs and rock'n'roll?  No cause there is no balance there either(truth gone out the window).  Will there be feelings which equate with sex, music, celebration etc.... yea there will.  They just won't be sodomizing your wife.  Will I be sticking my cock in someone's poop-shoot?  Well, I don't now and don't intend on it anytime.  Will exciting sex exist.  Sure it will.  Passion will be the rule of thumb rather than lust.  Lust is a perverse form of love.  Will I play computer games.  Hmm I think we will be forever inventing things, searching, exploring this universe and the next(yea scientists agree that there are, not only millions of galaxies but more universes out there as well).  Do I believe the universe will be occupied and explored.  Well I think I am rambling now.  I hope I answered your question with clarity Lurikeen.  <br>

I think I see what you are saying, now. I think we agree that motion is involved in our sense of time. &quot;Perfection&quot; has always been problematic for me, though. We can logically analyze and empirically analyze items in the world, but how would we judge something as being the &quot;most perfect&quot;. It would be like grading the quality of diamonds. We can only compare those items within the realm of our experiences. Anything outside experience (not in strictly an empirical sense of the word) can't possibly be used in our analysis of perfections. In short, we don't know what the scale could possibly look like, so our talk of perfections become vacuous. I believe the philosopher David Hume covers this very well in his  &quot;Enquiry conerning the Principle of Human Understanding&quot; and in his &quot;Treatise of Human Nature&quot;. Immanuel Kant also covers ideas over &quot;perfections&quot; in his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;.<br>

Example:  Imagine something you have never seen, touched, smelled, heard, tasted.  For example, pussy.  Remember the first time you ate one?  I don't remember what the environment was but I remember how I felt after I licked her suzy.  Sounds kind of off the topic but its not.  IMO perfection(the way we view it) happens in its physical sense.  It just happens on such a miniscule scale of time that we don't notice it.  Imagine if you will, your at a stop light.  Your taking a u-turn and so are two cars opposite of you.  You see there blinkers and their timing is programed at different rates.  BUT, eventually you will notice when they blink at the same time.  Of course its highly unlikely that they really did.  Our eyes aren't a very good judge for most process'.  However lets pretend that the blinkers are some type of energy release from two different energy sources(stars possibly)  Fluctuations of their energy(mabye a solar flare type thing)  These 2 different systems are generally independent but not 'purely' independent.  They somehow feed or shed off each others 'process'.  There are so many factors that we don't know about how these two 'systems' are affecting others but, eventually something will happen along the life of its process that creates a (hmmm whats the word) harmonious condition called, 'perfection'.  I guess one could compare it to our 'prime'.  Some peps say its around mid-twenties.  Whatever, its different for everyone.  But you see what I mean.  So, perfection is in the process and not the conclusion.  (recapping a little).  So I believe in a perfection for the natural world.  And I guess there is one for humans(in their physical sense) as well.  ( I will expand more on this)<br>

<br>
Perfection in its &quot;physical sense&quot; as opposed to another sense of the word? I understand to some extent what you are saying about the harmony of the blinkers in your example so let me respond there.<br>
<br>
I think you may be saying something like the blinkers share a property of &quot;harmonius blinking&quot; for a short duration of time. The property of blinking in harmony is a example of what &quot;perfection&quot; means. Something like that?<br>
<br>
If so, then time may be extraneous to your claim. Further, you would be in good company with Platonists through the ages who believe there are things that exist called &quot;universals&quot; (Plato calls them &quot;Idea Forms&quot;). The Platonist view of Universals is that shared properties of a class are the expression of a form. For example, if you have Red hair and I have Red hair the shared property of &quot;Redness&quot; is the expression of the form &quot;Red&quot;. It is Plato's &quot;Idea Forms&quot; that evolves into the ideas of &quot;perfection&quot;. If I have &quot;red&quot; hair and you have &quot;red&quot; hair, then there must be an ideal color of &quot;red&quot;, some think.<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say there are numerous problems with that view (imo). One large problem deal with how we could possibly know what the Idea Form &quot;red&quot; is. A deeper issue is what should the scale look like with Idea Red at the top and what at the bottom and in between? Lastly, how would we overcome perceptions of red (for example) to determine the Idea Form of Red? How I see &quot;red&quot; will differ from how you see that color. If Quantum Mechanics has shown anything at all it has demonstrated the realitivity of measurement. How we measure properties (like &quot;red) is contingent upon our physical construction.

  IT Sure has.  Again, perspective.  All that shit you see is there and isn't there.  I mean come ON.  If we know of things we can't see, hear, touch, smell, taste etc.. then its reasonable(at least beyond the logic of a dog) that uuther things are there which we can't see.  Another dimension?  One based on 'thigns' we have have never sensed before?  or things we have never imagined?  Possibly a 'universe' that exists on something called Positurectal?

Yes, I agree that it is possible there is more to the universe than what we experience with the senses. In fact, I know there are things like sub-atomic particles which I have never directly experienced. How do I know? Through use of analytical reasoning.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, as far as I know I have never heard of anyone coming to believe in god through use of sheer reason or sensory experience. Most believers I have met form a belief in god at a very young age. Usually because their parents believe. I have met some who &quot;come to god&quot; because of the depravity they feel associated with their past behaviors (e.g. masturbation, drunkeness, looking at Playboy...). Such people come to believe in a &quot;perfect being&quot; only because they see themselves as less than the ideal self, the archetype of self that cultures (and sub-cultures) like to foist upon individuals usually through some moral system. Any way....<br>
<br>
I can't really lend much to the topic of &quot;perfection&quot; only because I believe &quot;perfection&quot; is a chimera! It is just a figment of the mind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

God exists weather or not you choose to believe.<br>
<br>
Just as the air you breath is there, so is God...<br>
<br>
It's pointless to argue with people such as those arguing against the existence of God... You could prove to them that the sky is blue and they would say, prove to me that what you see as blue is the same as what I say is blue- then go off on some tangent about what really IS blue anyway??? Is anything ever really Blue or is it actually every color other than blue and reflecting the blue so thats what our eyes see???<br>
<br>
 It's pointless... like I said. I'm not going to try and convince you that God exists- I don't have to do that and neither does God. <br>
Why should the creator of the universe have to prove anything to you?<br>
Does a painter or sculptor have to prove to his creation that the signature at the bottom is actually his- only to have that painting or sculpture deny that there even is a signature? Obsurd!<br>
<br>
God exists weather you believe it or not and no amount of debate over this fact is going to change anyones mind one way or the other.<br>
<br>
Oh and Jesus DID exist, it's historical fact documented and described in roman text recovered from that era. His existance is not debatable... What is argued though, Was he the Mesiah? That friends, is anoher thread of discussion- this one however began as &quot;Do you believe in God.&quot;<br>

I do see your point although I am not atempting to prove God's existence.  I AM however explaining my thoughts, feelings and opinions of God's existence.  I know he is there.  I enjoy debate.  Its exercise for the mind.  Builds character too.  I enjoy pondering others thoughts and feelings as it makes me a better person.  No matter how strange or different someone's thoughts and feelings are, they have some truth to them.  Yep, everyone does.  Even the guy who went on a rampage in Indiana.  Was he right for what he did?  Hell the fuck no.  Would I have put a bullet in his ass if I was there?  Yea, would have bullet-blown his nuts right off.  BUT, he was angry for a reason.  Something bad happened to him.  Happy people don't freak out like that.  People that are hurt do.  And when they are hurt and no one recognizes their pain, they do crazy ass shit.  DAMN, that was waaayyyy off the topic.  Shit I'm sorry.<br>
  Not comparing Lurikeen or Triff or Xamael(haven't seen him in a while) with that guy, but everyone who has a different opinion has a reason for it.  <br>
  Anyway, Lurikeen(mainly only him) has recognized my opinions and I have recognized his.  At first we were flaming the hell out of each other.  Now, I consider him a friend because of his recognition.  And we have actually found out that we have much in common.  In fact more in common than any other person I have spoken to about such a massive topic.  I believe its important to communicate with love and truth.  This is the way God communicates with me and tihs is the way I prefer communicating.  Interesting thing is, Lurikeen and probably Triff and Xamael do also.  Not sure if you have noticed, but they said they are atheist.  It doesn't matter if people believe in God.  Everyone will know.  God loves atheists too.  He loves their thoughts and feelings.  Their drive and passion for understanding the world around them.  God loves them.  Does the person who is retarded not believe in God Dunkk?  Or does it only take growing up in a Christian household to become CHristian?  or does it take a conceptual part of the brain to believe in God?  Neither I say.  Its about love and truth.  These people speak of love and truth and they are Christian to me.  They have a relationship with God just as much as you and me.  Your heartless and cold opinion of them is the truthless and loveless communication they dispise.  And calling yourself a CHristian is not a category they want to belong to because of the way you communicated.  You are frustrated, but everyone is frustrated with something.

I don't know what happens to the 2 year old baby when it dies, I don't know about the retarded person, and I don't know about life after death for the remote cannables in outer mongolia...<br>
<br>
I do know that there is a God and that the world around me has too many complex systems that could not exist unless they were created at the same time, but I digress.<br>
<br>
My arguement (since we are all partaking of this friendly debate) is that God Does Exist and that it would be easier to argue that the sky is/ is not blue to a blind person than to try and prove to someone that God Exists.<br>
<br>
Weather or not a blind person does or does not believe that the sky is blue (or perhaps does not have any idea what &quot;blue&quot; is) does nothing to change the fact that the sky IS actually blue.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is that I'm not going to try to prove it by arguing a case- Im just going to be content knowing that I'm not blind and that the sky really is blue.<br>
:-)<br>
<br>
One more thing...<br>
Have you ever stared into one of those &quot;Magic Eye&quot; posters? These posters look like trippy drug induced finger paintings but if you stare into them long enough a 3D image appears from all the squiggels on the page... (a flock of birds in flight, dolphins, airplanes, boats... etc.) <br>
Anyhow, most people can see the 3D images but some just can't... no matter how hard they try or how many times you tell them &quot;look, it's right there!&quot;<br>
 <br>
It does no good to deny the existance of God... Just as the painting DOES have a 3d image in it, weather or not you believe that the image is there (or that God exists) changes nothing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/7/01 4:41:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=357>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to Dunkk</span><hr size=1>   Hey Dunkk.  I see what you mean about the poster and agree to a certain extent.  I know their are some people who have a more deistic approach to their belief in God.  (not saying you are)  But I however, believe that God makes a presence amongst us.  Or miracles if you want to call it that.  So I feel that its not futile to express my thoughts feelings ect.. to someone who disagrees.  Like I was saying before, I have learned since speaking to Lurikeen and respect his ideals.  At first we butted heads, then, the more we expressed our ideals, the more we realized we had the same ideals.  I believe that CHristianity has a bad stigma to many people and can understand why. This stigma is a huge barrier for most people.  This, again is my opinion and I am not trying to convert or influence other people who say they don't believe.  This is where I agree with you when you said some people just dont see it.  But, on the other side of the token I believe time is relative and it makes no difference whether someone doesnt believe it at this point in time.  Its all a journey <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Many people who say they believe have very little foundation for those beliefs and are not any closer to God than an athiest.  In fact, I think its probable that they are further away from him.  I believe atheists are in the 'belief' process just like a so-called 'Christian'; the only thing that makes them different is that they are at a different level.  I believe they are at a higher level than others.  Some people are inductive learners and some are deductive.  The advantage atheists have over us is that they will have a stronger foundation than most Christians.  Not necassarily because they have learned to live without God, but because they will appreciate God more when they DO believe and because they have been searching truth and love all the while.  I know this because I wasn't sure about Jesus.  Until I learned mroe about what he was all about.  When I accepted him as my savior I felt a very strong presence(not saying this should happen to everyone, but its what happened to me).   This recognition of God(IMO), can be compared to a flood of spirit whereas the casual Christian will have a constant flow in their growth with God.  Two different process'.  One is not 'better' than the other; just different.  FOR ME, when I found out that God sent his son to live as a mortal, he was assuring us that he too knows how it feels to be 'us'.  THAT is why I accepted Jesus.  I didn't know about this.  I just thought God sent his son to let us know that he was king and shit and that he loved us.  But knowing how it feels to be me; knowing what my pain is and accepting me with my faults makes Jesus one Kick-ass friend.  I didn't accept him because someone told me to; I accepted him because I searched for him and I found him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/7/01 5:06:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=358>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://64.81.30.48/EQstuff/luri.bmp height=113 width=105></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to the Last Three Posts</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Why should the creator of the universe have to prove anything to you?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hmmm... how about for the sake of love for his creation? Or, just maybe god is a social being? I can think of many reasons why a god would want to clearly demonstrate its existence. You seem to be saying that being a &quot;creator&quot; absolves god of all and any responsibility to its creation. So, I suppose, in your view, god could arbitrarily nuke millions of people at will? And, that would be OK because he is the &quot;creator&quot;, right?<br>

I am going to make a remark here Dunkk, so don't take this too personally. Such remarks (as yours above) is flagrantly arrogant. Many, many, Christians do not even see how they come across to others when talking about the existence of god or when they talk about their church's teachings.<br>
<br>
You know Dunkk, you have no idea who I am and I certainly do not know you. But why would you even attempt to imply that non-believers in your god are incapable of hearing your case, or for that matter are &quot;blind&quot;? It is utter bull shit! One thing I respect about Brutas the most is that he is very humble about his belief in a deity. He mentioned that we flamed back and forth, but not once did he EVER attempt to belittle me, Triff, or others for our non-belief in his god. I am not going to go much further here.... What I do want to say, Dunkk, is that it is not &quot;pointless&quot; to argue over what you believe is &quot;truth&quot;. It is actually &quot;pointless&quot; not to argue about it. If you are incapable of holding an argument it may show that you have not searched your feelings deep enough to express them in the slightest. I will leave it here. /shrugs<br>

Id Like To Believe In Jesus, But<br>
(The harder, less frequently discussed questions)<br>

Many good books have been written on the accuracy of the Bible, and for that reason, I will move on now and spend some time talking about the witness of Jesus outside of the New Testament, because that witness also is abundant. <br>
<br>
Well begin with the Jewish witness. Although the original church was made up primarily of Jews, most of the nation of Israel rejected Jesus as the promised Messiah, and the Jewish priests and teachers were particularly hostile to Him. In the Talmud (an ancient rabbinic storehouse of law, wisdom and commentary) Jesus is described as both a sorcerer and an apostate. <br>
<br>
On the eve of the Passover <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Yeshu</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, He is going to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to Apostasy. Anyone who can say anything in his favor, let him come forward and plead on his behalf. But since nothing was brought forward in his favor, he was hanged on the eve of the Passover (Sanhedrin 43A, Babylonian Talmud from Tannaaitic period 70-200 Ad. Translation from Jacob Shachter, Sanhedrin, Translated into English With Notes, Glossary And Indices, Chapters 1-6 by Jacob Schachter, Chapters 7-11 by H. Freedman, London, 1948: Soncino, p.281-2). <br>
<br>
1. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Yeshu, of course, is the Hebrew word for Jesus.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;Hanging&quot; was another way of describing a crucifixion.<br>
<br>
2 Apostates were people who broke from the faith and/or preached heresy. Jesus divine claims certainly placed Him into this category. The idea of a mere man claiming to be the God of Israel was as outrageous and dangerous as false teaching could possibly be. (Unless, of course, Jesus was telling the truth). But the Sanhedrin (a Jewish puppet court, allowed by the Romans to have limited jurisdiction over internal affairs) did not believe His claim and had no recourse but to denounce Him as a traitor and blasphemer.<br>
<br>
Now heres the big question: Why did the Talmud go on to conclude that Jesus was also a sorcerer? Because, in those days, if you didnt like a religious personality but could not deny the fact that He was doing miracles, the only recourse was to call Him a sorcerer, or tool of the devil. Although most Jews today will insist that they do not believe in Satan, Jews in Jesus day did. He was mentioned in the Holy Scriptures (Job 1, 2), and He was viewed as a rebellious spirit who sought to deceive people by performing miracles, as exemplified by the magicians of Pharaohs court who imitated the miracles of Moses (Exodus 7, Kiddushin 49<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , Babylonian Talmud).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What we have then, is a fantastic anti-Christian source with bias pre-disposed against Jesus, a source nevertheless affirming that a teacher named Jesus came to Palestine with incredible claims and an ability to perform miracles.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
...There are more sources recording the activities, teachings, and &quot;hanging&quot; of Jesus. Just as the Movie Ben Hur illustrates there were hundreds, even thousands of witnesses to his miracles, &quot;trial&quot; and crucification. (Im not using the movie as a resource... just an example to show that there were others that saw Jesus and wrote down their thoughts about him and his teachings.)<br>

&quot;We now come to the issue of mention of Jesus in the Jewish Talmud. Here McDowell's lack of scholarship is again painfully evident. In fact, we are again tempted to say that because the correct information is so readily available, perhaps his failure to provide it is a deliberate attempt to mislead. We must first explain that the present Talmud contains virtually no mention of Jesus. This is because there was much persecution of the Jews during the Middle Ages, and many Jews were afraid that the presence of the numerous unfavorable references to Jesus which existed in the Talmud of the time would bring down the additional wrath of the Christians. These references were gradually eliminated, by agreement, during the many subsequent recopyings of the Talmud which occurred over the years. However, most of these references to Jesus have not been lost to our view, since they have been collected by scholars from ancient copies of the Talmud and republished several times. Of course, McDowell is blissfully unaware of all of this. If we look at the materials con-cerning Jesus which had been removed from the later copies of the Talmud, we can see that they say that he was a bastard and a magician who learned magic spells in Egypt or else stole the secret name of God from the temple and used it to work magic or miracles. The father of Jesus is also claimed to be a soldier named Pantera. At any rate, authorities are agreed that most of this Talmudic material derives from the period from 200 to 500 A.D., and represents Jewish attempts to deal with the growing strength of Christianity. It makes no attempt to be historically accurate and, in fact, is of no use in determining if Jesus was an historical person. McDowell, of course, mentions none of this, and is also in error (or purposely misleads) when he says that &quot;Comments in the Baraila are of great historical value:&quot; and then gives a quote which leaves off the initial few words, namely &quot;And it is tradition ...&quot;. This means that the Talmudic scribe was merely reporting what had been said by Christians (and this is in about 300 A.D.). The passage describes how Jesus was stoned and hanged for practicing magic. That doesn't quite sound like the New Testament account.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;When you add up all of the following facts, the case for the existence of Jesus as an historical person becomes rather remote: 1) there are no proven, legitimate references to the existence of Jesus in any contemporary source outside of the New Testament (which is really not a contemporary source, as it was written from 30 to 70 years after Jesus supposedly died), 2) There is no evidence that the town of Nazareth, from which Jesus' mother supposedly came, ever existed at the time he was supposedly living there, 3) the existence of Jesus is not necessary to explain the origin or growth of Christianity (were the Hindu gods real'?), 4) the New Testament accounts do not provide a real &quot;biography&quot; for Jesus until you look at the Gospels. The earlier Pauline epistles imply only that he was a god, and 5) the biblical accounts of the trial and death of Jesus are logically self-contradictory and legally impossible. Jesus could not have been executed under either Roman or Jewish law for what he did. Whatever you call what he did, it was not a capital offense under either system. Rather, it looks like someone is trying to make Old Testament prophecies of the death of the Messiah come true by fabricating a scenario which simply doesn't make sense legally.&quot;<br>
