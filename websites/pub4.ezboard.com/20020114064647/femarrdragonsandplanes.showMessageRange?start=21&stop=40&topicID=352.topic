<br>
Thought i'd add a little imput to this thread, as I've always spoke my mind. Two specific points come to mind:<br>
<br>
1) Congrats on the slaying of Innoruk. After failed attempts, it's nice to show that persitance payed off. In fact, I had been conversing with several SF and wishing them luck for the raid. Congrats<br>
<br>
2) On that note, although you did slay Innoruk, i must comment on 1 fact (take it as you wish). SF has been in hate 3-4 days out of the last week, and although you were 'on a mission', perhaps it should have been taken into consideration that other people would like a 'shot' at Inny, or more likely, be allowed a 'shot at the zone' solo. SF had several chances in Hate before (and at Inny), and they failed (nothing implied). Perhaps it was time to let affliction have the plane to themselves, or some other guilds. Personally, i dislike sharing planes, mostly because of the lag, crossing 'ooc' messages, and perhaps even pulling errors which can happen as a result. These probelms will hopefully be solved with the expansion.<br>
<br>
Comment Bevo: Well Said<br>
<br>
Comment: Yadan (*smiles*)<br>
<br>
As a note to Yadan particularly, I've always felt that doing a 'dragon' or doing a 'plane' is significantly different. There are several guilds that are 'planes' capable (which requires 18 people to break/hold/farm). However, to do a dragon, you need twice as much as this (usually <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), not to mention specific gear, and specific classes often to succeed. This is where the prime difference is between a dragon/plane is. In fact, I believe Nagafen was up for about 2 days after a patch (the day we killed vox) however no one took him down.<br>
<br>
Anyways, i'm done, congrats all who got some Phat L00t, but more importnatly, congrats on taking Inny.<br>

<br>
Rhamel flamed my whole guild last night.  He accused us of farming, and training.  Ok, as for farming: Affliction goes to a plane once a week.  Hate was our one plane for the week, and that was it.  However, Storm's Fury has been 3 or 4 times.  Does anyone else see any logic behind Rhamel's statement? (I am not flaming SF for spending that much time in Hate, I am pointing out that I hate hypocrites).  As for training, we had been neutral for 30 mins, discussing things in the guild and not pulling anything, yet Rhamel accuses us again of training your pulling path.  I'd like to quote Haknukum and say &quot;Roses are red, violets are blue, Rhamel can't pull and blames it on you.&quot; *Cheers Hak*<br>
<br>
Lastly, one comment you made to us really disturbed me last night Drall.  You told us to go back to farming our own corner.  What were you implying by this?  Are you accusing my guild of farming Hate?  If so, you are terribly mistaken, my friend.  We did come for loot, yes, but going to a plane once a week for one spawn is hardly farming imo.<br>
<br>
btw, I would like to tip my hat to Yadan for being a very mature individual throughout the night, and congrats to SF on your slaying of Inno. <p>Eurmuthur Edgecrusher

I was asked by my guild not to post a flame. So ill keep this civilized.<br>
<br>
Jubei,<br>
<br>
Even in your last post, when you appologized to certain people for the ass you made of youself, you still continue to ignore the facts. We did NOT in ANY WAY invoke 'play nice policy' Heres things from my point of view...<br>
<br>
I check the website. There is post there titled, 'Innoruuk Dies Tonight'. We are all hyped. There are about another three hours before the server comes up. We meet in our chat room, and complain about Verrant, blah blah blah, etc. Someone comes in and lets us know that there has been two more hours added to the down time. People kill time, we want to get online and get things underway. People are in and out of the chat room. The two hours pass and we learn that there is to be an ADDITIONAL two hours. We have people constantly trying to download the patch, constantly trying to log in, Constantly checking the server status, etc. Finally, we get the message. &quot;ITS UP!!!&quot; We rush in, by the time i download the patch we have a group up there. This is about 5 minutes after the servers came up. I get ported up and notice there are some affliction up there. I ask what is going on. Well, it turns out they are just there for loot, so there is no real problem. Some of us are kind of angry because the lag is bad, and we are losing people to LD every 10 seconds, but we deal with it. These are the facts.<br>
<br>
I guess the point is, they had NO more of a right to be there than we did. They didnt have the plane claimed. They were not there before us. They did not set up camp before us. I dont know what you were told, but you are either not able to comprehend whatever language you were told in, or you were misinformed.<br>
<br>
Everything above was simply stating that you are wrong. Now, on to you being worthless.<br>
<br>
First thing first. You insulted our entire guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I wonder why you think your guild deserves the right to enter other peoples raids when no other guild on the server does... oh wait, because you are all trash, by bad =) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
again...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  you are all trash <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You then go on to speak of greed. I, personally, find this rather ammusing. Why dont you tell us about the first SF/MS fear raid? I think that is a fine example of greed. Or the second chance we gave you, in hate? What happened then, or do you so soon forget? Perhaps you are just bitter.<br>
<br>
Oh, and one last thing. You question the respect we are given from outsiders? We get multible tells a day from people asking to join because we are not respected? I had about 25 tells congratulating Storms Fury on the death of Innoruuk from people who do not respect us? You havent a clue what you are talking about. You have made a complete fool of yourself. I suggest you cut your losses and walk away. <p><IMG SRC="http://fareal.com/Destian.png">

I am apologizing to EVERYONE in SF with the exception of Drall and Blessed who both I cannot stand =)<br>
<br>
Blessed for you to say you have never begged for gear... ROFLMAO Yes, you don't beg, but instead manipulate men into giving you them.  So I give you credit on your skills in manipulation, but no credit in your skills as a player.  My biggest regret was talking you into staying on the EM server when you thought about starting over, but in retrospect, I realize now that is just another one of your stupid ploys for attention that you seem to need from any and all that will give you it.<br>
<br>
And Drall... i think the second time, or was it third, when you disbaned SF and were guildless for a while, I distinctly remember you saying that you wanted to join our guild or Da`Ice.  To bad no one wanted your greedy ass =)  And as for my motivites, I used to think you were a cool guy, but then I started reading the Emarr board and saw how you chose to insult people and then I learned who you really are.   <p>Jubei Kibagami <BR>

<br>
You obviously made it about our entire guild when you called us all trash as i already pointed out.<br>
<br>
To go further, and i know many will disagree with this, every member of a guild is a representative of said guild. A mark on any member is a mark on everyone. Insulting, drall, my guildleader, as in insulting anyone else within this organization, will be taken as a personal insult. You speak of honor, yet fail to display even the smallest bit.<br>
<br>
Ill sum it up for you:<br>
<br>
1. Insulting a guildmember is insulting an entire guild.<br>
2. Making an ass of yourself is making an ass of your entire guild. <p><IMG SRC="http://fareal.com/Destian.png">

<br>
Lets get down to business. First off, sorry to Affliction MONKS for my additude last night.. i should of tried to explain(help) in tells instead of using /ooc /shout to express my anger. Yes, you were training the zone and you would never know because it wouldn't have time to get to you... Example: agro a roamer near back of the cleric temple. A cleric inside gets pissed and has to go out the front of the cleric temple, near maestro temple, past ramp to inno, then toward the zone in point .  Enough said on that, we got to inno, so who cares. It just took a lot longer dodging shit.<br>
<br>
-Yeah, we have been there alot this week.. for loot? nope, we cleared a straight path to inno and went upstairs. People coming in there with no intention of taking out the big dogs. that to me is a farmer. Someone mentioned that this was my 5 th guild this week. hehe, i have been a member of Insurrection, LoV, and now SF.  You would be hard pressed to find even a handful of people in those guilds to say a bad word of me.<br>
<br>
-You questioned my pulling skill as a monk.. Please find 2 ppl i have pulled for ,not in affliction smoking your pole, who would not want me pulling a plane , or anywhere else for them.. <br>
<br>
-To take it a step further how does this sound. Me(pulling single) and 5 SF VS 2 of you pullers(chaining) and 5 Affliction. Timed race on an efreeti run... It takes great pulling and speed. Let me know *kisses*<br>

<br>
This is one of the problems of two guilds in a raid at once in a plane, along with people going LD (both pointed out by Sf commments above). I'm not pointing fingers, but as affliction pointed out, it was there first time in hate during the raid, and was the one raid they do a week (as opposed to SF being in hate several times this week already).<br>
<br>
&gt;Yeah, we have been there alot this week.. for loot? nope, we cleared a straight path to inno and went upstairs<br>
<br>
The reasons are insignificant. It's equivlent of being on a mission to robe a bank and killing 30 innocent people on the way, and then saying &quot;we weren't there to kill innocent people&quot;.<br>
<br>
The prescence of 30 additional people probably caused indirectly the death of a couple affliction, our caused a loss of playing time for some members of affliction (and SF) due to LD's. <br>
<br>
I'm not attempted to downplay your succesfuly raid, i'm merely trying to point out that you had tried already twice during the week, and perhaps it was time to let affliction have the zone to itself. <br>
<br>
&gt;To take it a step further how does this sound. Me(pulling single) and 5 SF VS 2 of you pullers(chaining) and 5 Affliction. Timed race on an efreeti run... It takes great pulling and speed. Let me know *kisses*<br>

That is just plain stupid, and I think even you can comprehend that.  I ask you again: Why do you accuse us of farming?  I do not see your logic here at all.

For some reason he seems to have problums with SF,Drall, and Blessed. To my knowlage no one in SF has done anything to Jubie in the past, but if they have its up to you as a reasonable person to confront them with these things. not to flame a guild as you have here.<br>
<br>
 As to farming and the rest, well I belive that farming is happening and there is no way to stop it. Ppl will go into zones and set up camp for items they need and stay till they get them. Thats unfortunitly part of this game. To accuse ppl of it dosent stop it to whine about it only helps you vent and piss others off.You cant tell me that you Jubie have never farmed stuff just as I cant tell you that I havent. Because by deffintion alone we are all guilty of it. I belive if you read the rest of the posts here you will see that PnP was not used and I know none of the ppl in SF would ever use it to try to ruin another guilds raid.<br>
<br>
 Now on to the Rhamel issue. Rhamel is an excellent puller. He has proven it time and again in the planes. Ablazen is correct in the fact that with mutiple groups in the planes it becomes incressingly harder to pull clean, but to my knowlage none of our pulls ended with Affliction being trained or any of there monks taking the hit. Tempers did flare towards the end with a 5 MOB train going up the ramp to Inno, we do not know were it came from but I belive it was a crossed pull that caught the back end of our ppl going up the ramp. Rhamel did lose his temper and /ooc somthing unfourtinetly I was in the Arena when that happened and I  belive appologies were given afterword. As for lag well what can I say ppl LD all night it happens we lived with it and so did affliction.<br>
<br>
 As to all of us in SF being scum, dirtbags or whatever you want to call us, I wont justify this with a response. Drall is an outstanding leader and has all of our support and confidence.<br>
<br>
 If you do feel you need to complain about our guild or one of its members. Please direct it to that individule, or to Lith who is our guild officer in charge of complaints.<br>

<br>
     I keep trying to post on this and I get something else handed to me to do at work. <br>
<br>
     Anyway, Jubei I would like to say up until your post on this thread I had the utmost respect for you. I will give you credit for saying that your post does not represent MS (being friends to a few of MS members, I respect your guild for those few people I know are great people and I know they would keep only the best of company). One thing you forgot to omit was at the end of your post, stating you were a proud officer of MS. What conclusion are people supposed to come to?<br>
<br>
     I will qualify now. I was not in on the insertion to the POH nor for 90% of the raid to kill Inno but it is my undrstanding that some sort of arrangment was made with Affliction for the raid. As Ablazen and Rhamal have pointed out there are inherent problems with 2 guilds in a raid on a plane (pulling problems and LD problems). This was endured by all involed in the POH. Yes, maybe there is a better way to handle this in the future, any feedback from anyone would be greatly appreciated. <br>
<br>
     As to our being in POH several times this week. Yes, we were, but as someone stated earilier, they were not loot runs, they were what you might call training runs for the big fight. Learing the zone, getting our tactics down pat, etc. Was this unfair? Probably, and for that I apologize. However not many guilds do planes runs during the week (I could be wrong correct me if this is so). If these runs had been loot runs, I and a lot of other SF would be wearing a lot more planes gear than we are now. Yes, we got loot but it was not our primary function this week.<br>
<br>
     Drall greedy? I can go along with that. If wanting the best for those in your guild and wanting to be with them when they reach new heights beyond the norm is greedy, then Drall is one greedy bastard and I love him for it. <br>
<br>
     Farming? I think Zalig pretty much summed that up. <br>
     <br>
     I would like to give major props to the members of SF for the kill of Inno (I went LD after casting one heal and wasn't able to get back in time for the kill, you bastards killeed him too fast<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and maybe it was just poetic justice being I wasn't there for most of the raid<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <br>
<br>
     I would like to leave this in saying that ANY problems with SF members should be taken to me. If you could do this, your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.<br>

<br>
But now Lith is stating that one should contact him no matter who the problem is with i.e// &quot;ANY problems with SF members &quot;. <br>

I'm just inquiring why you have 'one official problem dude', and why cna't problems be resolved on a face to face basis, without a 'moderator' of sorts.<br>

Anyways, congrats on your achievement, and congrats to Drall for oraganizing the event.<br>

<br>
     As to the issue of a mediator. You bring up a good point. One should first try and work it out with the person in question it is always the best way to handle things. Should the problem not be solvable with said member and you feel you need to speak with an officer I would be the one to speak with.  Perahps I misrepresented myself and thank you for catching that. As to why I am the person to speak to otherwise, it is so Drall can concentrate on other issues concerning the guild. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>

<br>
&gt; Example: agro a roamer near back of the cleric temple. A <br>
&gt; cleric inside gets pissed and has to go out the front of <br>
&gt; the cleric temple, near maestro temple, past ramp to <br>
&gt; inno, then toward the zone in point<br>
<br>
This is actually correct <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  there is a specific cleric that does this. It's an easy problem to explain though, and easily avoided by the pullers of the other group (if they were told what the situation was). For someone that's never pulled in that area, or doesn't have a good knowledge of the zone layout, it's very difficult to figure out if something will aggro from the other side of a wall. If you want to fight in a plane while another group is there, you should be prepared to communicate with them on these kinds of problems (regardless of who was there first). Planes are extremely buggy. It's virtually impossible for two groups to work a plane at the same time without affecting each other in some way. So communicate, bug out, or be ready to suffer the consequences of Verant's bugs.<br>
<br>
&gt; People coming in there with no intention of taking out <br>
&gt; the big dogs. that to me is a farmer<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what this implies about 'farmers' according to your definition, but there's one thing you should understand. The 'big dogs' you mention are not very big at all. Don't let the big polygons and phat lewt load fool you. For a solid group, Dracoliche, Cazic Thule, and Innoruuk are marginally more difficult than the roamers that surround them. Their magic resistances are pitiful, their HP and regen is sad compared to even dragons, their AEs are insignificant and easily resisted, and their melee can't ever affect more than one person at a time. Maestro is the exception, he is 100% MR, but his melee is sad and his HPs sadder, so he can just be beaten down. The somewhat difficult part is clearing to these 'puppies', and getting them single, and even that is simply a matter of  finding a map (or having someone *cough* show you the way *cough*) and, ofcourse, some time and patience. So putting down others for killing mobs in the plane and not going after 'big dogs' is pretty silly... especially given that the particular group you were mentioning had 20 ppl and 1 48th cleric.<br>
<br>
&gt; You questioned my pulling skill as a monk.. Please find 2 <br>
&gt; ppl i have pulled for ,not in affliction smoking your <br>
&gt; pole, who would not want me pulling a plane , or anywhere <br>
&gt; else for them.. <br>
<br>
He only has to find one, because I wouldn't want a monk with your attitude pulling for me in a plane. Pulling takes patience, knowledge, endurance and concentration. What you did in hate, and your post here, to me speak very clearly that you're lacking in all four. And no I don't need to have you pull for me to make that call... no thanks.<br>
<br>
&gt; To take it a step further how does this sound. Me(pulling <br>
&gt; single) and 5 SF VS 2 of you pullers(chaining) and 5 <br>
&gt; Affliction. Timed race on an efreeti run... It takes <br>
&gt; great pulling and speed. Let me know *kisses*<br>
<br>
Not much of a claim. Pulling to the efreeti is actually fairly easy. 4 people and a monk can clear to the efreeti without a lot of problems. And a &quot;timed race&quot; doesn't mean much either. The spawn is 20 minutes, so you either make it, or you miss the boat. Verdunae pulled for a single group of us the other day all the way to the efreeti with no problems... and not to bag on her skills or anything... but she's still a young monkette compared to some of the old school badasses that you will never know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and who coincidentally never needed to boast about their accomplishments like you do.<br>
