<br>
Has anyone written up a list of rules to follow while on a raid?  Granted those of us of higher lvls know the rules (make a hot key for primary assist, don't attack until assist is called, breaking mez will cause the enchanter to drop kick you, etc).<br>

Some of the points might also reflect certain pet peeves of mine about such raids <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1. Pay attention! Cant be stressed enough, i've seen many deaths that could have been avoided if people listened to those who knew what they were doing. Having been on just a few planar raids, you DO NOT know what you are doing yet, so listen up.<br>
<br>
2. Make an assist key. Assisting is good, assisting is your friend. Do not ever initiate attack in any other way than hitting your assist key. Most raids will have a designated primary and secondary assist, whose names you will use when making your assist keys. Again, do not EVER start attacking in any other way than hitting assist. This will make your enchanters happy, and will keep you from looking like a dork. If you are afraid you may hit the wrong key and start an attack early, dump your melee hotkey into bank 8 and remap your autoattack key to Q, or something similarly unlikely to be used by mistake.<br>
 <br>
3. Don't go on a raid and then leave after 2-3 hours. If you intend to go on a plane raid, make sure you have at least 6 hours after the start of the raid. Myself I always make sure I can stay for at least 10 hours in case things go bad. Leaving early creates many difficulties for the rest of the raid crew. Why? you may ask... well, to get out you need to be ported by a wizard or a druid, since you can't gate like a caster would. The porter needs to get back to the raid afterwards. So, to accomplish this someone needs to kill the porter in a duel, after which he/she has to regain enough mana for a group tp, then port you out, finally being ressed back to the corpse in &lt;insert plane here&gt;, leaving a cleric low on mana and the porter oom, thus greatly slowing the ENTIRE raid cause ONE person had not planned on staying long. This is not good, as I am sure you can see  Not to mention the time it takes to remake the groups affected by people leaving. This is helped somewhat by the introduction of the Translocate spell, but many people will still demand a port to leave on grounds of not being bound where they want to go. And there might not be a wizard around with this spell, so don't count on it.<br>
<br>
4. Don't bitch about dying a lot, or about losing exp. Even a level for that matter. Dying and exp loss happens a lot in bad places. Just accept it and get on with the raid, if you're lucky you may get some nice booty to make it up. And a rep as a guy to is not easily shaken as well, which is not bad at all. Actually, in general, just dont bitch on a raid. If you ask to join a raid, you have to, IMO, accept the way the raid is run by the leaders. If you don't like the way certain people run raids, dont go.<br>
<br>
5. Don't ever be left alive with no clerics camped out after a train. In cases like that, being selfish is the worst thing you can do. Sacrifice yourself to give the clerics a few more seconds to get out. If you do so you may even end up with some rather cool screenshots hehe. Got a few of those myself, being left all alone in PoH with clerics camped out and a few dozen corpses lying around... and of course those 5 clerics of innoruuk beating on my sorry ass.  <br>
<br>
6. Get a map of the place you are going to. Though it is definitely possible to do without, as long as you have people to follow around to whereever you are going next, it -can- happen that you become seperated from the main group. And in a case like this, it is a good thing to know where you are, and the route to<br>
where you are going. If you are lost and do not have a map, just sit tight, ask for help, give your loc to a rogue or monk, and wait for someone to come get you. DO NOT try to wander around trying to find the others, as this will most likely result in one of two things: <br>
     A. You die. Not so bad, as a rogue and a cleric can remedy this fairly quickly as long as you get your loc. If you do not get the loc, it will take longer. But still no big deal. Or... <br>
     B. You find your way back, only to realize you have 17 mobs on your tail when the enchanters are low on mana from the last pull, and clerics from healing up the tanks. This is BAD. An example of where a seperation could happen is in PoH on the wall camp, when it is time to move on. If you haven't heeded<br>
point (1), you could well find yourself alone as the rest of the raid team relocates. So, in conclusion, better keep that map handy until you can find your way around the place you are going to. It pays off. <br>
<br>
7. Don't just go to the plane where your armor drops. I know it is great to leave a raid with some pH4t L3wTz (sorry, couldn't resist), but showing some sportsmanship and helping others get a shot at whatever -they- need, will mark you as an unselfish guy. And that can often help you get in when that raid leader<br>
you helped out in hate last week, is now hosting a fear raid.<br>
<br>
8. Do not worry about only getting a few kills, or even none, on a large raid. It is often the case that 1 or 2 groups pretty much monopolizes the kills. Why is this? Because it makes sense to have a few very strong groups of the highest lvl people, who can really help out if the shit hits the fan. Although I -have- seen an<br>
ungrouped wizard get the kill in the face of an entire raid crew hehe (was while a few group were being rearranged after some people leaving a raid, see (3)) If, on the other hand, you are in one of the kill groups, it is possible to get some decent exp on a raid. I got 1/3 blue bubble last time I was in hate. Just don't<br>
expect it and you won't be disappointed.<br>
<br>
9. Don't go off posting shit about a raid, no matter how badly it went. Shit happens, and hopefully everyone learned from it. How do you think it has come by that some people have the experience to pull off flawless raids? They tried, failed, and tried again until they knew how to get it right. Posting about how poorly led a<br>
raid was will do nothing but prevent you from seeing a plane ever again. Sure, I have been on quite a few raids by now, but I shiver at the thought of leading one. The people who do lead them have a VERY tough job. So cut them some slack. If you have some constructive criticism, I am sure they would be all<br>
ears AFTER the raid, but there is just not time for a long discussion while it is going on.<br>
<br>
10. A few tips on cutting down on lag, which if you are not prepared can be a major hindrance: <br>
     Make sure you have server side msg filtering turned on. This is accomplished by typing '/serverfilter on'. This will filter spell, hit, miss, dmg shield and other such spam before it is sent to your client. Without it, the info will be sent to you taking bandwidth and creating lag. <br>
     Hide corpses. Done by typing '/hidecorpse all', this will prevent all corpses except your own from being displayed, thus cutting down on system lag.<br>
     Turn off transparent polygons. This is toggled by the '~' key, usally situated on the top left of your keyboard. This will also reduce system lag.<br>
     Turn down sound detail and particle effects. This is done in the options menu under General and Display respectively. Another system lag reducer.<br>
     Turn off as many battle spam messages as you can, to make full use of the server side filtering. Done in options under Chat Filters. Affects both system lag and internet lag, if you have server filtering turned on. Otherwise affects just system lag.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah... almost forgot one:<br>
11. Always sacrifice a gnome for good luck, before starting any raid. It may not bring luck, but at least you'll be rid of the gnome <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I found myself reserving that particular date and time you stated to attend the raid to only find that I was bumped out by other druids, who were lower &amp; posted at the last minute. To top things off you didn't even put me on the reserve, I was totally bumped off. I don't know how to view it really. So it would be nice to get an answer from you since you made the list Faeadari. thanks for your time<br>

<br>
12. Do NOT bother the raid leader with non-essential crap.  If you have questions, ask your group leader and your group. If they cannot answer that, the group leader will forward that question to the raid leader. Go up the chain-of-command. Spamming the raid leader with useless crap wastes his time and distracts him from concentrating on the things at hand. The raid leader has ALOT to deal with. Bother him only with very important questions.<br>
<br>
13. If you must leave, let the raid leader know. I've been on a few raids where people just left without informing the raid leader. It's common courtesy to inform the raid leader of these things so he can make adjustments on groups. <br>
<br>
14. When you sign up for a raid, you have signed off your right to do things &quot;your way&quot;. You will abide and do what the raid leader tells you to do. A raid is not a committee decision deal.  If he tells you to run to your death. Do it. Good raid leaders do things for a reason. If you cannot abide giving up &quot;your rights&quot;, do not go to the raid. <br>
<br>
15. Signing up on a raid does not mean you automatically get you IN the raid.  Signing up is just that: signing up. You show your interest in the raid. It is up to the raid leader to decide on who goes and who doesn't. There are just some slots that get filled up very early on and some slots have to be reserved for specific classes that are needed for the raid to succeed. There are also semi-invite raids where seats are already reserved for certain people. Each raid is a bit a different. Another thing, I might want to add... if you are ACTUALLY PRESENT at the raid start up and there are no-shows, there is  a good chance that you can still get in even if you did not make the List. Take the time to be there and you might get lucky. <br>
<br>
16. Know the raid loot rules ahead of time. Each raid leader does loot a bit differently. If you cannot abide by the loot rules, don't go. Most loot is done in shout and in a quick fashion. If you are doing something else other than concentrating on the raid, you will miss it.  If you miss a call on loot roll because you were unattentive, too bad. Do NOT complain and whine. It's over and done with. If mistakes happen on the roll, tell the raid leader. Be a good sport about loot and the raid leader will remember that. <br>
<br>
17. No Drinking on raids. I've been on a couple of raids where people think its &quot;fun&quot; to drink and raid. Drinking just shows how seriously you take the raid: i.e. not very. That just shows disrespect to the raid and everyone there. I'm sorry if you drink on any of my raids, you're never going with me again.<br>
<br>
18.  Do not complain about how this particular raid is going DURING the raid. Shit happens on raids. Deal and continue with it. If you think you can lead a raid better, go run one. There are people made to be raid leaders and others are not. Until you have walked in their boots and done the things they have done, you have NO RIGHT to bitch, moan and whine about how things are going or done. Good raid leaders have paid their dues. They have earned their reputation by failing, trying again and doing it until they do it right. I have the greatest respect for these raid leaders. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps some.<br>

<br>
Only use the assist key to start an attack, and ONLY HIT IT *AFTER* assist has been called by the Main Assist.  If you see the assist called again, hit it AGAIN...  battles can shift, and non-mezzable critters can show up.  Reassisting, and waiting for the call to assist are VERY important to a smooth raid.<br>

<br>
I shout my rules out pre raid everytime. It's a short list.<br>
<br>
0. DO NOT FUGGIN MSG ME UNLESS YOU CAT IS SUPERGLUED TO YOU TELEVISION AND IT&quot;S HANGING FROM THE CEILING AND ABOUT TO LAND ON MY HOUSE!<br>
<br>
1. When you enter the Plane you will go LEFT &lt;----- Everyone knows which hand is left? It's the one you prolly don't use for self gratification!<br>
<br>
2. You will assist you WILL NOT assist untill I call ASSIST.<br>
<br>
3. Adjani is on speed/c2 you WILL MSG her for it NOT ooc shout ect.<br>
<br>
4. DO NOT shout for your mobs to be pulled.<br>
<br>
5. if you end up away from camp and get aggro DIE! Get loc and Die we will come get you and rez you.<br>
<br>
Then I add a few specific to where ever we are. Info on TT's GL's etc.<br>
<br>
No amount of rules postings are gonna help the mindless dinks that just won't listen. They will get a bad rep and eventually won't be brought on raids and will either quit or finally grow brains and listen. I'm fairly lucky in that I have a regular team I raid with and we can usually bail outta any situation a dink gets us into. I also have the advantage of hosting many an open raid and have a high tolerence for dinks and being able to work around them.  <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usthistor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sthis Tor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 6:33:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=802.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raid rules</span><hr size=1> Wow.. lots of rules heh.  I like to keep it simpler than that.  Just tell people to assist, no 1 or 2 piece loot rules, epic pieces go to those closest to finishing... yada yada heh.<br>
<br>
If someone is messing up I'll deal with them on a one to one basis.. if they can't get it right then they will be asked to leave.. simple as that.<br>
<br>
Rules confuse the issue IMO.  Just set things up as a raid leader so everyone is doing everything they normally do and make sure you have one experienced person in each group to answer questions as they arise.  The raid flows more naturally that way.<br>
<br>
I've run 6-7 hate raids each one better than the last and I've had fun as a raid leader on each and every one.  It seems like many leaders set themselves at an adversarial relationship to the players raiding with them.  <br>
<br>
The truth is that in a well organized hate raid, there is very little 1 person can do outside of the puller to cause a total disastor.  Usually if someone's doing something it's pretty obvious and you can take quick action to correct or remove the problem.<br>
<br>
One last thing heh.. what is it with all these enchanters that go apeshit if someone asks for a buff in ooc?  So what??  If they were proactive and had these people on a buff list it wouldn't be a problem anyway heh.  <br>
<br>
S.T. <br>

<br>
Trust me there's alot 1 person can do to totally screw a raid and they don't even need to think about doing so. I've done hate around 50 times and lead at least half of those fear is in the 30s. All of my planar raids were opens. I've seen 1 person totally blow an otherwise perfect break which is why i stick to 2 group breaks for Fear and Hate. When I start leading Hot Exit raids I will most likely do 2 group and coh the others in. Simply not walking were you're supposed to can screw a raid (Hot, Hole etc). After so many Open raids you learn that a raid can be screwed in ways that you couldn't even dream of. This is why Visions and other guilds prefers to raid solely in guild. You fuck up regularly with them and they'll kick you out see ya.<br>
<br>
Buffs in ooc/shout. Um no. I'll bitch and get you Tl'd off the raid long before my encs will on that. Why? I got enough going on that I don't wanna see that crap on my screen. You use ooc or shout it better be to tell me we got mobs aggroing behind us or some other emergency. Not because yur crack faded or you want a_stupid_mob_00 pulled. Buff lists? my encs have better things to do then care about who's got what buffs. I've raided with the 2 best (based on the last enc botb) Chanters on the server. I won't host a raid without one of them in my pull team and neither one of them uses a bufflist. They got much more important things to think about. In a group sure i'm sure they stay on buffs but in a raid it's not something they need to care about. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usthistor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sthis Tor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 8:06:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=802.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raid rules</span><hr size=1> Well...

I'm sure you do too hehe not trying to imply otherwise.<br>

I can see your point on the ooc buffing thing.  Buff lists aren't hard to keep track of though and generally people appreciate it heh.. no biggie.. just a personal style thing.  <br>
