Don't you know that there are only 2300 people playing on the server at peak. The chances of you grouping with a person only once is pretty slim unless it is a twink. Most of the time if you stay in a location you get to see the regulars of that location. You start to know who the assholes are also.<br>
<br>
If people were only out for themselves all the time then this game would have died a long time ago. Because why play a PvE game with a bunch of greedy pricks. Thats what RL is for. <br>
<br>
Help a stranger out in game and maybe just maybe you have made thier day a little bit better. Also maybe you could have a person return the favor one day. Thats how the first guilds were formed. And groups and friends. <br>
<br>
It will be a sad day when I finally quit everquest. Not because of the Thief Epic. Or my Shrunken Goblin Skull earring. It will be sad because I will never get to hope to see Mitch dead in a corner somewhere in DN. Or get a tell from Breckenridge that<br>
consists of &quot;Hoyas&quot;. Or running into a friend that I have had in game for 2 and a half YEARS. <br>
<br>
If people were only in it for themselves, it would be too much like real life, and I don't want real life in a damn video game.<br>
<br>
All the Phat loot you get. All the Dragons you kill, all the amazing tactics you come up with Pale besides the fact that if you help someone out they have a better day. And once the last Everquest server is shut down, and all our amazing 12 16 Luclin loots are destroyed. you know what you will remember? The people you met and the things you did WITH them. You may have a few good solo memories like killing a dragon by yourself, but most of the memories are going to be of the stupid, funny, greedy, assholeish, charismatic, incredible people you have met in you travels of norrath. <br>
<br>
So once again people Don't be a dick player and demand your roll on a peice of gear that someone WILL equip. If they get that item it doesnt hurt you, it just means next time they will already have the item and hopefully it can be free randomed.<br>

Randoming all would be the fairest deal of all to distribute valuable loot. But that would make people go to EC and I know how frustrating and useless it is going there, so I support NBG for the people in group who want it.<br>

I keep reading posts written from the perspective of people who think they lead the pack or people who are constantly giving away shit. Here’s a news flash, you're giving yourself entirely too much credit.<br>
<br>
There are people on the server who have seen tons more shit handed out, over, around them while adhering to the NBG concept, than you… myself included. I was in the first group to venture down into the crypt, kill Hierophant Prime Greko and see that cloak drop. Matter of fact, I saw four of those cloaks drop and not once was I the benefactor of said item. Three of them went to people not in my guild, people I never even grouped with before that point. Fact was, I had a White Dragonscale Cloak and they had shit. There was exactly 30 seconds worth of discussion, then the Cloak was handed to them. To this day I won’t take a piece of gear if someone else in the party/group has a lesser item.<br>
<br>
Quit taking the stand that you are going to get eternally fucked over, it doesn’t work that way. I can’t even count the number of Lamentation’s I saw get handed to people with no random what so ever. It was my group, they joined to help out and were rewarded. Play the game and quit whining about what you aren’t getting. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

Think about that.  To me, friendship is the greatest phat lewt of all.  And I'll be damned if I let a bunch of equipment pixels get in the way of that.<br>
<br>
And if friendship is not your thing, and your greedy, consider that you need an uberguild to do the big stuff.  Last time I checked, most or all uberguilds frown on those who are selfish and greedy.  Therefore, you would serve yourself to appear as one who serves.<br>

I read your post and I have to agree with that. But I have also got to tell you I'm not in that section of gaming. I support NBG in groups. I vote for it and if there is disagreement that splits the group I leave with NBG people. I haven't ever abused it and actually my current trading style invalidates me on most NBG too (I don't want to claim NBG on item that I might sell to get plats for trading when someone offers above its price). But then again I will put my nose on every random all, when there is no valid NBG argument (hell yeah I random against all people, who ask if they can get it to their twink/friend outside the group).<br>
<br>
The rogue has always been my main and I'm sort of proud of it. I have never felt useless because I didn't have DB Sash, Traka Tooth and Locustlure to start with. Yet I have spent some time getting upgrades to my gear at EC... not that much... got myself Slime Coated Harpoon at level 27 and was happy ever after until I got traded myself Traka Tooth at around 47-48 or so.<br>
<br>
One reason for me never seeing those people again actually was that at least for me not playing in peak times, I found out myself as only rogue in zone and among the last ones to get the group. Why? Because the times I made my leveling from 1-50 rogues weren't popular yet. I got told that &quot;The warrior in group doublehits the damage you bstab, go away.&quot; This wasn't always the case and I quite a few friends too, but still didn't see them ever again.<br>
<br>
So even though you're right about the gimp rogues around (many of them have outleveled me already), when I started and played my rogue  up, there were only handful of 50-60 rogues in who list, which I tended to check pretty often.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Writing that &quot;random all would be fairest&quot; - I meant that if the items used to roll on the trade circle smoothly, everyone had the same &quot;average&quot; income in loots that drops.<br>
<br>
But then again your post woke me up to the thinking back... I had forgotten one pretty solid fact. Melee's tools are his/her weapons and equipment. Casters need gear too, I'm not saying that, but melee folks don't have spells, thus the part casters get from their spells is within melee's gear.<br>
