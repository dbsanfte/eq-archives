Like it or not, Bin Laden is a hero of the afghan-soviet war. (Yes largely due to CIA funding)<br>
This is why the Taliban allows him to remain in Afghanistan.<br>
However, the Taliban has spoken against terrorism. If anyone came up with any indisputable evidence then The Taliban would not hesitate to hand Bin Laden over to the world courts. An admission of involvment would cost Bin Laden his solace. The Taliban is already on unsteady ground internationally to put it mildly. They really don't want to give anyone any hint of a valid excuse to bomb them.<br>
<br>
Bin Laden does not hate Americans because of our religious freedom. His reasoning is that he says America is trying to conquer the world. <br>
<br>
Also remember that it is not the people of any culture or nation that did this. It is a terrorist organisation, period. Whatever race, culture, religion they are is unimportant. Focus your disdain on the planners and hijackers, not on the race or culture or religion they happen to also be a member of.<br>
<br>
If we do discover that indeed it was Bin Laden, we will confront the Taliban with our proof, how they respond will determine the extent of our missile attacks.<br>
<br>
It could just as easily be an Iraqi Funded terrorist organization, assuming, as current investigations suggest that it was an arab terrorist organization and not some ultra militant, US militia.<br>
<br>
Again do not blame every member of the race, culture or religion for the actions of a handful of radicals who happen to be of the same race, culture or relgion. <br>

Why you ask?  Because they harbor these terrorists.  Arghanistan may (or may not for all anyone know) disagree with terrorist attacks, but Yet thier goverment does nothing to stop it.  The US is sending a message out.  As far as I am concerned we should Nuke the fuck out of them.  The group who did this (it hasn't been released yet what group did this but the fbi, cia, etc are stated to have said they are know who it was) started war.  In war people die.  All those people who where in the buildings and planes died because of these assholes.  For what has been done thier is no other cause of action.  Fly are fucking jets over the middle east and let the shit hit the fan.  <br>
<br>
We (the US) have balls for,  yes many people will get killed even if they had nothing to do with(it is war no matter how you look at it).  It but unlike these faceless batards, the places bombed will have reason for being bombed.  The US wouldn't say &quot;Hey there is a mall with 500 people in there atm, lets blow it up.&quot;<br>
<br>
IMO I think they need to be bombed into the ground.  They like it die anyways so why not help them.  Before More suicide bombings, killing, etc is done here.<br>
<br>
This is from one of the other posts:<br>
But to those who said any dumb fuck  can fly a plane after it is in the air, I ask our you retarded?  Alittle cessna (spelling?) yes.  But not a jumbo jet.  If you seen any of those 4 planes fight paths on cnn, they knew what they were doing and where to go and how to use all the instruments.<br>
<br>
Though truth be told...The sleeping giant was awaken when we entered WWII.  But study the war outside of what your school histroy books and base knowledge of the war.  And you will see how close the Germans were to wining the war.  One mighty say the allied forces where lucky in more ways then one.    &lt;To those of you how will read this last part and say think or say that I am anti Us in WWII...Let me say it now fuck off.  I am glad we fought for what we knew was right and wrong.  And I am damn glad the US is what it is today because of all the men and women who fought for what was right.<br>

The fact remains that Palistine has **for years** been the training ground for all such terrorists.  What Arafat is afraid of is not that they'll be tied to this, but that someone will remember that the PLO was what created him, trained him and turned him loose in the first place (probably because he was better as a loose cannon for them IMHO).<br>
<br>
I heard a report that one of the Palistinian people had called into (or whatever) one of the stations and didn't want the public to believe that the &quot;few&quot; that were on the bank cheering our losses, were representative of their country and referred to his countrymen as &quot;idiots&quot;.  Sorry, but a &quot;few&quot; doesn't fill the bank, although I do agree with the idiot reference.<br>
<br>
Then I saw where Arafat himself was giving blood to send to make sure we had enough.  These are people that KNOW if bin Laden was involved (and they must think so too or they wouldn't be quite as worried as they seem to be), the US is not going to be pleasant to deal with.  Ollie North tried to tell the world that bin Laden was a threat 15 years ago.  I can wish he would have tried a little harder right about now.<br>
<br>
However, although the reaction from Palistine was totally inappropriate in the eyes of most americans, most of us are willing to wait the necessary time to make sure that we're aimed at the right people.  As I said in another post, Oklahoma City taught us that one.<br>
<br>
One thing I think that a lot of people are forgetting, is the 4th plane.  The only one that *didn't* make it to it's destination.  Whether it was because one of the &quot;hijackers&quot; got mouthy and told the hostages that the plane was aimed at the White House (don't remember where that info came from, DO remember the reference to it on the news).  Or maybe just asked a cohort and was overheard.  Either way, the result was the same.  These people already KNEW they were going to die.  Had been told to make phone calls to let their loved ones know.  But refused to let these people take out one of our national monuments.  Chose instead to find a way to stop them.  However they managed it, along with the rescue workers at the Twin Towers, they have now become our newest American heroes.<br>

This was a horrible act of terrorism i think obviously and i also doubt that no countrys govt gave the green light and planned this.  I don't think that we should sink to their level tho, there has been enough innocent bloodshed in the past few days.  It was a tragic thing what happened but why spill more innocent blood?  To try to justify death?  Of course im all for takin down whoever did this but for those who didn't do anything to hurt us, they shouldn't be killed.  I don't want what happened after pearl harbor to happen again.  How we sent all those japanese to those evil camps, one of our many mistakes.  You can't blame gud and honest people for this. <br>
<br>
I also think however that if it was bin latin (which me and many other people are convinced it was) he should be brought to justice.  This means that whatever country he is in should help us bring him to justice.  If they don't want to i think we should go in and get him ourselves.  Hopefully that won't be necessary, im sure tho that more innocent people will die.  Innocent people always die in huge conflicts like this.  One thing is for sure tho, no matter what we do that tragic day will be remembered for a very long time.  No matter who we capture, what we do it will never help justify all the death and destruction that was caused.  <br>

<br>
Hitting the WTC isn't easy and any person who has said otherwise has used the analogy that once a plane is in the air its easy to fly.<br>
<br>
No...its easy to point in one direction but to find New York and then the WTC at 550mph isn't easy. Before you know it both have passed you. There was no messing around, they hit it dead on without a fly by.<br>
<br>
Air Force One is a moving target smaller then the WTC and you are not going to hit that. The fighters that constantly escort AF1 would take you down before you got close. Not to mention the fact that there were 6 planes that day. Not two.<br>
