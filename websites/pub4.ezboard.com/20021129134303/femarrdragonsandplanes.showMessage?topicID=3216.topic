I can not believe that anyone would blatantly lie to people in order to have them join a guild.  Essentially, you tried to steal an entire guild, I just wonder how many people knew the truth when they made the transition.  Your actions have proven that you never deserved to wear the guild tag of Eternal Haven.  <br>
<br>
  I have a special place reserved in my hatred for Caelie, you would have never gotten your epic without the help of key members of the guild that you left.  They waisted many hours logged in as YOUR character, in the hopes that your rez stick would make the guild better.  You can shove your epic up your *&amp;$%*@ *&amp;%. <br>

The guild basically broke up because of arguing factions between the officers. While one faction was away on a vaction in Vegas, things heated up even more. One member made a comment about the guild being dissolved when the officers returned from Las Vegas, so many members of Eternal Haven left and Formed Endless Prophecy. Its a real long story, and most of it could be read at the Eternal Haven forums, but Fystie took all the threads and hid them in a PW forum. I had friends on both sides of the argument, so I left Eternal Haven and won't be joining Endless Prophecy. It is really sad to see petty bull @#%$ tear apart a guild. <br>

We are just lower than whale crap. I'm glad you got some one sided info there and not gonna waste my time on it.<br>
<br>
We just up and started a new guild for no reason. Glad you can find comfort in that.<br>
<br>
 By the way, I have been away from EQ for a week and not once did I or have I asked anyone to leave Eternal Haven. Eternal Haven self destructed by moving the discussion from the Officers forum to the General forum for all to see when some of us left. If they had of left the discussion and flaming in the Officers forum, the guild members would have never known there was a problem.<br>
<br>
Thats one of the reasons we left and formed a new guild. Everything we discussed in the Officers forum about a certain non guild member that had caused problems in the past seemed to get back to him and he likes turmoil and flaming so it was never gonna end. When it gets to the point that you can't speak your mind in an Officers Forum or on the Phone with someone about problems that should stay within a certain Forum, I would say its time to move on. You know theres just some people out there that like to keep stuff stirred up and this is a prime example.<br>
<br>
Just remember there are always two sides to every story.<br>
<br>
Now, I don't know who was telling what to members about the new guild. If you ask any of them, they'll say they didn't get the tell from me.  I never mentioned a new guild that was forming to anyone. When I got an invite to the new guild, there were already members in it. Do a little research before you go accusing somebody. <br>
<br>
And yes, a new guild was formed because the Leader had posted twice in the Officers forum that she was tired of trying to hold the guild together and when they got back from Las Vegas, Eternal Haven would probably be no more. <br>
<br>
This whole thing is because half our officers saw things one way and the other half saw it another way. Neither side was willing to bend. About 3 officers on the other side guildremoved because they didn't want to deal with what was bothering us, so about 4 or 5 officers on this side guildremoved ourselfs as well, so we could go somewhere and not have to deal with it either.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every Officer in Eternal Haven with the exception of a few that remained silent thru the whole thing are guilty of what happened to the guild. You can lay blame where you want or wherever it makes you feel better. <br>
<br>
As far as getting my epic and leaving the guild. Well, I have accused people in the past of the same thing and its always so convenient when your pissed at someone. <br>
<br>
I never had any intentions of ever leaving Eternal Haven, but on the same token getting my epic didn't bind me to stay there once we found out we were being stabbed in the back by other Officers that couldn't keep private discussions private.  <p>Caelie<BR>

While some of us were away in Vegas a guild was formed and people started leaving EH to join it BEFORE we'd read and posted on our guild message board about the continuing situation .. also rumor has it that disinformation was propagated around EH about the guild being disbanded hence why people left to join Endless Prophecy.<br>
<br>
Sad thing is the situation got WAY out of hand, something that should have been left in the past was fuelled by a multitude of childish remarks from both sides and ended up causing a major rift in EH.  Sadder than that, it appears steps were taken while half the guild officers were away and unfounded rumors were spread while we had no chance to rebutt them or defend ourselves.  But we weren't there, we don't know what happened while we were gone and probably never will so why waste time rehashing the past, however recent it may be.<br>
<br>
Long story short, S H I T happend.. it was stupid then, it's stupid now .. lets just drop the whole thing for god sakes and not turn it into an even more public pissing contest than it already has been on our guild boards.  Leave it be people.<br>

Maybe you could have waited a couple of days, till they were back, so that everyone could talk things out.  I think that your group  of friends leaving may have been inevitable, but I think that your attempt to do it when the others were away was just an attempt to bring more people along with you.  I guess that is the part that really bothers me.<br>
<br>
  I put this out on the rants and flames board because no one else would.  Anyone that would consider joining your guild should know how your guild was established.<br>

Sounds like things were close to the brink as it was, it just happen to be convenient that one faction was away for a bit and the other people took the initative to try to at least salvage something.<br>

Can you say hypocrite?  All of us were gone on vacation while you (EP) recruited from our guild.  Pretty disgusting how you (EP) recruited my own brother, and the way you did it is absurd.  Telling him and several others that Eternal Haven was disbanding, but we ALL were going to EP.  Including Me and Matt.  That's one sided info there dont ya think, specially when it wasn't even the truth or close to it.<br>

I'll give in to the fact you had a reason.  Yes you did, but the reason isnt in EH, you took it with you.  As long as you have a grudge or hatred towards him, you will never have fun and enjoy the game.  Sad thing is neither will the members you took with you.  <br>
<br>
He was in the game for over 2 weeks and NOTHING happened.  Why?  Because you didnt know he was back, as soon as you saw his name in game, the fights began.  Who started em?  You.  Who wouldn't let a fight from 8 months ago drop? You.  Who destroyed this guild? YOU!<br>

I find that extremely amusing.  Does it make you feel better to lie?  Does it help you live with your pathetic self?  80% of the guild had gone before any posts were made or moved.  Most of which were gone before we even got home from our vacation.  I self destructed nothing by moving those posts, I just wanted ppl to see what kind of an ass they were dealing with.

Nothing discussed got back to him, he recieved no inside information.  How can you say he likes turmoil and flaming so it was never gonna end?  You started 4 threads in the past 3 weeks.  You flamed, you kept it going, you wouldnt let it end, hell you didnt even have a reason to.  You were simply pissed that I remained his friend, and occasionally grouped with him.<br>

None of this would be happening, there wouldnt be two guilds now if it wasn't for you.  I hope you can pat yourself on the back at night, because you used me to get what you wanted, then discarded me.  Something you flamed ppl for yourself many of times.  I wouldnt look like such a fool if I had actually made you put in at least 50 % of the effort for your epic.  I sat at that camp twice as long as you.  Angel sat there longer then you.

I thought we went over this whole a new guild was formed because of this .. thing already.  NO a new guild wasnt formed because I threatened to disband.  All of you had left prior to my post about not knowing what would happen when I came home from vacation.  I quoted your goodbyes, I posted the times you all said them, and then I quoted myself and the time at which mine was posted.  It was half a freaking day after you all disbanded.  I threatened nothing, I wasnt even given an opportunity to say my peace before you all had left.  <br>

I am glad you think your not gonna have to deal with crap where you are.  You took the crap with you.  Remember the person you didn't like, who you say caused this (even though he started nothing) wasn't even in EH.  Guess what?  He still isn't.  I'm going to really get a kick out of watching the demise of your guild, because you force your oppinions, your play style on everyone.  The first person to have an argument with you there, will see your true nature.  Hopefully it wont be after you took advantage of their generous attitudes also.<br>

I will agree no one was perfect, but at least I never claimed to be.  I will say we didnt start threads and threated this and that because of who you picked as friends.  I will say we didn't bring up old laundry over and over again.  I will say we didnt go behind your back and do anything drastic while you were away.  I will say we didnt have to lie to make ourselves look and feel better.  I will say we always gave you an opportunity to speak, and always gave you the benefit of the doubt.  <br>

<br>
You have yet to have one convesation that wasnt kept private.  You have yet to be backstabbed.  To bad we can't have the comfort of saying the same.  I never knew clerics used piercers, guess pulling the dagger out of my back proved that wrong. <br>
<br>
I wont let you win.  I will continue to play and enjoy it.  I will continue to be myself, despite getting used over and over again.  I will keep this guild, and rebuild it. You wont have the satisfaction of breaking us.  <br>

LOL I really got a laugh outta that. So you think every officer except those that didn't speak out are guilty of this horrible mess huh?? Well uh guess again toots, to be honest the only people I really think had any real part to play in this mess was you and the non-guild person you have an undying greivance with. Both of you were just too damn childish to let go and move the hell on, you keep saying how there were 2 sides that could not agree on anything .. actually there was one side, your side, and anyone not on your side that had the gaul to speak up was for all intents and purposes WRONG. We chose not to defend you and your actions, but hey guess what .. those of as that are friends with your &quot;nemesis&quot; never at ANY point EVER condoned his actions past or present either. So basically we're bad people for thinking that the pair of you have been acting like 5th graders and not actually taking sides?? <br>
<br>
The ironic thing is I can actually see your point and understand that you feel betrayed and so forth, hell I would too, but the fact is we didn't actually defend the actions of either side and rather than trying to resolve the problems amicable you chose to label us as the &quot;opposition&quot; because we know the person you have issues with. <br>

<br>
Incorrect, none of the Officers that Caelie accused of &quot;tattling&quot; did so. They told her this multiple times in the face of her accusations. She all but called them liars, she refused to believe them.  A former member of our guild (because of this fiasco) posted on our message board that, although he/she was personally called by one of the accused Officers, and told that no information was given to the other party, he/she refused to believe that Officer (how does one respond to that?).  Also inaccurate are Caelie's repeated statements that these same Officers defended the other side over her, this is patently untrue, these Officers defended neither side, telling both of them that they were out of line. Somehow this was taken to mean &quot;since you are not with me, you are against me,&quot; and was escalated to abhorrent heights. It sickens me to see the he said/she said finger pointing crap. Unfortunately, emotions ran high, and assumptions were made on partial or bad information.<br>
<br>
I am not here to accuse one side or the other, the bottom line is that both sides (in the argument, not those who were attempting to remain neutral) were wrong, and neither side was willing to budge, until it was too late. It is unfortunate that a neutral stance was taken as a sign of complicity towards one of the parties involved.<br>
<br>
A tree that does not bend with the wind will eventually break.<br>
<br>
Conflict is inevitable, it is a fact of Human existence. Being thus, it is how we respond to it that matters. In the end, the only opinion that should matter to you as an individual, is your own. Others can only insult you or slight you if you let them.<br>
<br>
Sadly, in today’s high-tech age, we work in the &quot;now.&quot; We look for immediacy in our activities and actions. We, as a society, don't want to spend the time to reflect on the moment, to gain greater clarity. This is reflected in the micro-society of EQ. We tend to act before thinking. And, because of some strange inability to admit we are wrong, some weird egocentric belief that we have to be right, we point our fingers at each other and lay blame. We judge too fast, and act too quickly. We fill ourselves with pride, and use it as a weapon.<br>
<br>
I am as guilty of the above as the next person, and I know of, virtually, no one who isn't.<br>
<br>
I wish no ill towards those in Endless Prophecy, and I choose to stay with Eternal Haven. The initial conflict was not mine, and I wish that I had not been dragged into it, it should have been kept between those who had an issue with each other.<br>
<br>
/sigh Oh well, the wheel continues to spin, and things move forward.<br>
