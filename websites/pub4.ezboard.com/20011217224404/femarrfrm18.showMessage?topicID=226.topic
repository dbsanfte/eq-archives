I hate to tell you that we are covering that next Saturday night, and you will have to wait.<br>

Why can't you just accept the post for what it was?  Lukaria provided a link to a message that she found to be uplifting, significant and important enough to her that she posted it on this rant and flame ridden message board.

Sorry, but you are not at all convincing. I think Lukaria needs to get a life. Maybe when he gets more experience he will understand that one doesn't blatantly advertise a particular church in an effort to proselytize at the expense of others sorrow. He could have just as easily said a little prayer and endorsed embracing any faith when in a time of need. Instead he decided to promote his church with a little advertising. Hell, it would be like a minister putting together a TV commercial... &quot;We know your sorrow, come to First Baptist where we are teaching why your family members or friends are dead.&quot; Want to defend such a low down action?

Why do people think that if a Christian even mentions his/her 'religion' they are trying to convert the masses? Also, if a Christian tries to share his/her religious faith, you think that it is to add another notch to the bible belt...far from it.<br>
<br>

I don't know... Evangelical Christians like Lukaria have this reputation many describe as &quot;Bible Thumping&quot;. Go figure why they have that rep! Could it be because their entire purpose is to convert individuals to Christianity? Sheesh!<br>

I didn't see a posting here were someone was asking for a church that was providing answers. Can you quote someone on this board who was asking?<br>
<br>
Martigan, it is surprising how that some would defend the used car salesman tactic that Lukaria presented. &quot;Oh, come and see what cars are on my lot!&quot; Compare to, &quot;Oh, come and see what my church is teaching!&quot; The sad thing is that Lukaria opted to prey upon those who may, in fact, be feeling very down about what happened. He demonstrated (and maybe not intentionally) the height of religious manipulation under the guise of doing something &quot;good&quot;. The best option is to not present your church or religious beliefs unless ASKED first! &quot;Let your light so shine...&quot; is what Jesus said. Bible thumpers are too desperate to &quot;add another notch&quot; in the name of their own egos. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Then why don't you spell it out for me oh, wise sage?  You said that you don't think proselytizing belongs here (it's not here, but I'll go with your premise).  Then you suggested that Lukaria should have merely endorsed &quot;any faith&quot; as a means of obtaining hope.  However, from a Christian perspective (Lukaria's and mine), that is simply inadequate (just like any other &quot;faith&quot; I've studied, and that includes several dozen).  A believer (of whatever religion) believes that only their particular faith is the source of hope, redemption, whatever.  A true believer, could never endorse &quot;any faith&quot;.<br>
<br>
Not trying to convert you, just attempting to educate you on the subject you feel some need to attack.  Perhaps if you actually tried to understand &quot;faith&quot; you might grasp where we are coming from.  But, based upon your final comment in this thread and the ridiculous new thread you started, I expect you will maintain the ostrich-like attitude and keep your head firmly stuck in the sand, or elsewhere.  That's really too bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umartigan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Martigan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 652<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/28/01 8:37:47 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.kliv.com/images/OldGlory.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Church's teachings on the current events:</span><hr size=1> Hey Muzaak,<br>

&quot;Then why don't you spell it out for me oh, wise sage? You said that you don't think proselytizing belongs here (it's not here, but I'll go with your premise). Then you suggested that Lukaria should have merely endorsed &quot;any faith&quot; as a means of obtaining hope. However, from a Christian perspective (Lukaria's and mine)...&quot;<br>
<br>
Besides the fact you are full of shit let me go on... Raedwulf, you think I need educating. Let me educate you. My head is not in the sand. You have no idea what the &quot;new thread I started&quot; (which was deleted at my request) was about. You have no idea about the thread above. Suffice it to say that I have nothing more to say to you. I am not hiding my head in the sand. If your dumb ass (let me repeat in case you didn't get it &quot;Your dumb ass!&quot;) can't grasp what I am saying then so be it. Let me just make it clear... Raedwulf, kiss my ass. If that isn't clear then send me a tell in game and I will be happy to clarify how you can kiss my ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 395<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/29/01 9:58:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a Life yourself</span><hr size=1> I got it.

Whether or not I hold my own beliefs. <br>
<br>
Do you have faith, or not: who's faith do you want, do you think changing someone else's beliefs gives you the right to practise yours? What is that faith? Surely not a religion.<br>
<br>
Self-fulfilling doctrines are faithless, isn't it enough proof of your faith that you can't believe without hearing yourself saying to others believe? Alone?<br>
<br>
Go back to the faithless religious pit you crawled from, there is no state of grace in noisily commanding another's free will to ease that selfish anxiety and baseless doubt, you true unbeliever. Remember what purity of spirit you came into Nature with, if the holy ghost dwells in people do not presume to place your church first above heaven in adjudicating an earthly primacy over God's glory. That power is not yours, so shaddup.<br>

I don't accept the holier-than-thou tone attacking him and he is more right, than Raedwulf, whom must not be disputed (being such an authority and undeniably irrefutable): I did not accept Raedwulf's proprietary usage of the term "Christian" as if he invented true belief himself, either. That would hardly establish the weight of either's arguements. Raedwulf pffft.  <br>
<br>
The damned bring judgement upon themselves since the damned cannot be saved, nor Raedwulf's infernal point of view; either way ye reaps what ya sows: sow the Wind and ye shall reap's the Whirlwind. <br>
