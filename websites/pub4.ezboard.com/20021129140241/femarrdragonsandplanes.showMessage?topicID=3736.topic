hello all this si some thing we all hate having to do but this turd whipe desrsves what he gets since the gm realy dont seem to give a dam very much SILVERADO was in my guild as well as his alt MANNDIE i didnt even realize silverado left the guild he claimed to jion a freinds guild but as of yet i see no guld tags on him like most guild im sure if some one is in your guild most exspect trust with in guild and most of the time that what you get well... on tuesday oct 8th after spending 3annoying long days with my 53 druid AUNK seling stuff around the world of norathh i didsided to delet my 39 extar pally and my lev 20 extra enc so i had trusting freind transfer all the items from my pally to my enc that could not be used for my new bard and got her up to bazzar so for next 2 days she tride to sel stuf first day was very slow sold very littel but next day on monday the 7 th wow i had sold alot of stuff after coming back 4 hours lasre 9800 plat in pockets and soon aafter that sold alot more it was my lucky day i soon after that sattred buying my 47 enc and new bard and my self up grades i got a bracer of comprehention the 15 in tel one for 10 k and abracelt of beauty for 4900 plat and a spirt tome book nice deal and a tattred hide cloak for 1k and 1 vanshier claw earing for a trade for a golden bracer since h wants only 1500 plat for it another nice deal plus 7 akeva bloods for only 650 plat another nice deal ineeded to make black arilla halberds with my 47 enc whos a 237 smith ... so after all thios buying and selling i tride to get trusted freinds to do tranfers for me they wher busy at the time so since to this day iver never had troble with any guild folk not stealing any items from me i ask MANNDIE to tranfer all i had bought the rest of her cash 1250 plat and my last 17 items i had left to my 53 druid aunk she said yes ... sooo after i handed her the items and even gave her a free 10 slot bag and crytalgrinder dagger beacuse i though she could use em soon as i got back she went afk the sec i logged out after i heled her like 20 times and 3 tells she went link dead and i am sure now on pourpose.. so after givng her the benifit of the doubt for 30 mins i petioned for help and as normal not help for while after a guide took down list of lost items and info i waited and waited after seeing him back on i told seiner guiled he was on and she made recored or some thing about her no idea what MANNDIE then logged off again and disbanded from my guild MELTDOWN for whom aunk is the leadr of asgardia is my alt and on top of disbanding from the guild she emediately went anon she wed have troble finig her i sent her many tells and was ingored later on i was back in baz trying to fined folk possbly seling my stuff and low and belhold SILVERADO was there selling all my stuff off he didnt auction all of it with a guild link but since i new exactley was was mine and stolen i took screen shot of it and satred my player loggs to what he said after confonting him about it beacuse it wasent pure luck he happned to besellin exact item i lost and some stuff he had no need for or he could make like the imbuned elven chain armor and most inguild new i was only one who could make that stuff he prety much satred making up storys and then said manndie was his freind he worked with and that he had seconed account and they shared there account and passswords which to be gine with is not allowed he clamed manndie and his al;ts and freinds alts give him that stuff to sell for him while he was sleeping i said yea beacuse he doesnt want to get in trouble for sellin my stolen good he said i dont know why he would do this hes not type to do this another lie yet again i asked him to go log on freind account and get my stuff back he then said i cant now he just changed the pass word BS he said well i belev you and all heres 4 of your items back he gave me LOL yea those 4 items wher cheap items that wher some what hard to sell but he still kept the hard to get exspensive stuff to him self he said his freind said he still has all the stuff and hes get it from him next day well next day i got nothing and he wa son for like 30 mins max and didnt come back on as ether of em for the last 2 days he wrong ad he knows it .. i found out after waitng 22 hours from gm that he lied to me in saying his freind changed the password bescue gm told me that BOTH manndie and silverado ARE both on the same account so it impossble for manndie to be on with out silverado logging out yet another lie he told me to cover his butt.. i lost aprximately 30 k work of stuff to the bunghole.. and gm wont do dam thing beacuse not enough proff yet again evcen though they beleved me on most of it.. any help any one can give to me with getting this guy back making life hell for him getting my items back from him rpalceing items or selling me those items to me cheap for very nice price i would be grateful for it if often been told that im to dernd nice some times and to genaruse and kind and LOL this time i payed for my kind ness the 5 itesm i did list and the 1250 plat are all i realy care about getting back realy heck even just the 5 items will do please if any one can help make sure this guys eq days are hell dont guild invite him dont gruop with him dont do anything with him after what he did.. it plain to see after he stole items with manndie he logged on hiss econed account tranfed the items to alt and then tranferd em to silverado to sell em off sinc he is a lev 50 druid and i was told manndie is a 28 he mage but not sure on that just sure he has a he fm caster... sorry this is so big but it needs to be told so he made to pay for his crimes... thanks all aunk 53 druid leader of meltdown  <p>The more you drive, the less

i know the actual ANUK...(not AUNK)...and she's not even close in comparison with AUNK. but then again she did say &quot;seconed i was never any good at typeing to begine with or any good at english class in school.&quot; maybe she's just not good at speaking and using the language? clearly...but still, is very rude person.<br>
<br>
then the rambling and rambling keeps going on and on....and on.....<br>
<br>
oh and then...and on and on and on..<br>
<br>
i guess you do get what you give, and because you've only taken, people felt the right to take too.<br>
<br>
remember that time at the company picnic when they hit that home run and you didn't think i could catch it but i did because im fast as sh!t.<br>

<br>
It's really gotta suck knowing that you are the joke of the server, and that your name is in danger of becoming a verb (next time you accidentally train 3 groups and kill them because you panicked, you can all laugh together and say &quot;oops, I pulled an Aunk!&quot;).  What's even worse is that from what I have heard she actually has her own guild now.  Probably the only way to stay in one without getting booted, but I feel sorry for the folks who got rooked into signing on with such a total and utter moron. <p>Malevant Faeshadow.
