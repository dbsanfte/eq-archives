The other day i was in EC on my twink named Ooggie trying to sell a dire wolf hide cloak.  Well this guy named alnaron sends me a tell saying he will trade me a &quot;catapult&quot; a &quot;glowing stone band&quot; and a &quot;circlet of shadows&quot; i said well no its ok because i didnt want a bunch of stuff to sell.  so he keeps telling me how awesome the items are and i keep saying no, is this hassarement?  Well i said can i see the items he said yea there on my twink i said ok. so he got on his twink named grevenn and showed me to 3 items, i said what does the &quot;catapult&quot; do? he says its the main peice for a SWEET bow, i said what the stats he says they are 30/40 effect knock back, so i say well thats a nice weapon.  so then i cancelled the trade and said no. he continues to harrass me about trading the items i finally say FINE what the hell. so we trade the items and i try selling the catapult and a friend sends me a tell asking what it does i told him stats of the bow he wow thats great stats so he says hold on a sec, i say ok.  then he sends a tell sayin there is no bow with those stats i say oh well hold on a sec i asked another friend if he has ever heard of one he is a 58 war...  then i told him well im sorry then and we talked a min and said bye.  after this i sent grevenn (alnaron) a tell beggin to trade the items back because i was un sure about the items selling and there value.  after a min he says NO LEAVE ME ALONE.  i say what? then he says shut up and leave me alone.  So i asked him again and he said he sold the item to a friend i say who is your friend he says his name is &quot;bingbong&quot; so i tried to send bingbong a tell but he wasnt on, so then i told grevenn he wasnt he said thats because hes in the other room sleeping i said can you wake him so i can ask if we can trade items back he says fine, so he logs off grevenn then bingbong sends me a tell saying WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!?!, i said well i was wondering if we could trade the items back because i thought it was an unfair trade he says no so i ask a couple more times he says no then he logged and i went stright to where grevenn camped and watched him log into that spot.  then i asked grevenn to trade back 1 more time, he said no, then i said DUDE I BEEN ASKING FOR 30 MINS NOW, I WANT MY CLOAK BACK YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT THE WHOLE THING. then he says so now your calling me a lier? i said yes i am, then he walks up to me and shows me IN TRADE WINDOW that he still has the cloak, then i told him to let me talk to bingbong for a sec to talk him into giving it back he said he had already left bingbong's house and was at his, but within in 10 secs of bingbong logging, grevenn logs back in? either hes lying or or he has great timing. so then i say yea right i bet bignbong is you he didnt say anything.  then i said duel my main for the cloak back he says only if i can log on my main i said who is that he says alnaron i said ok nm because my main 49 alnaron is a 60 war.  then after i leave him alone a few mins i see that alnaron and grevenn are on at same time, i give alnaron a tell telling me to give it back but alnaron doesnt know what i was talkin bout, so i thinking grevenn and bingbong are the same preson and grevenn is RL friends or just good friends with alnaron and knows his account info.  well thats what happened, all i want is my cloak back, can anyone tell me if this is possible or any info on those items i traded for? please it will be a BIG help! thank you for reading<br>

You told Alnaron you didn't want the item, yet you let him talk you into it. For Christ's sake! If you don't want something, say no. It isn't that hard! Alnaron was persistant and you were too stupid to ignore him.<br>

It's junk. The effect/use/etc of this item is still unknown.<br>
<br>
Now the only reason this should be up here at all, is if he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lied</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about it, then it's shitlistable.<br>
<br>
As to the &quot;harassment&quot; crap. You have an /ignore command. If you can't handle people wheeling/dealing and whining, then just sell all your shit to someone who trades alot so you don't have to deal with it.<br>
<br>
As to the lying part, that's not being a good trader or getting a good deal, that's total bullshit and belongs here (yet again) if he did it. You should talk to Karsys, or another officer of Dark Trinity about this, and let them know.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'd really love to see Alnaron's explaination on this one.<br>

You were the one harrassed? I was at Alnaron's house at the beginning of this &quot;ordeal&quot; (it was only about ten minutes long mind you).  He was selling the dire wolf hide cloak, I wanted it for my friend as i owed him for my FBSS. I offered the catapult and band and circlet for cloak.  He repeats &quot;what does (insert item here) do about 300 times for each one, im getting a bit annoyed. He does PC for each one somebody gives 3.5k for catpult, 1-2k for circlet, and nobody responds for band but I think it's about 1.5-2k, especially for an ogre who needs night vision, right? Well he goes through a series of ummms and err well i dunnos and i finally lay it down that either he does or he doesnt want to trade, its getting to be almost more trouble than its worth. Heres where it gets confusing.  I log on grevenn, give him catapult and circlet in exchange for cloak.  Then I switch back to Alnaron to give him band, everyone's happy.  About two minutes later i get tells from an irate ogre DEAMNDING (in not very nice words) that I trade him back.  I had already given it to my friends twink Bingbong. He DEMANDS to talk to him, I say I don't want to wake him (its 3AM here) but he will NOT leave me alone.  I log and run to Bingbong's (I refuse to share account info with ANYONE). I ring the doorbell and the door opens to a tired looking half-asleep Bingbong, I tell him what happens and he logs on and talks to Oogie for aobut five minutes, he was very calm, and I assure you he didn't open the conversation with &quot;WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!?&quot;. Oogie isnt very nice to him, so he says &quot;If you want the cloak come to Steamfront and I might trade you back&quot;.  Oogie flips out and releases a storm of obscenities.  Bingbong tells me to go home and log on, he had a port waiting for me and I picked up the cloak, he didn't want any part of this, I guess it was a good move for him as he didn't get SLed. I ported back and showed Oogie the cloak and said that I wouldn't trade back, but I had it now. Oogie flew off the rocker and cussed me out. I said &quot;Maybe if you had been a bit nicer, Bingbong or I would've traded you back.&quot;  Oogie said &quot;DUDE I HAVE BEEN SUCKING UP THE PAST 30 MINUTES!!&quot; (it had been no more than 10).  I said &quot;no&quot; about twenty-five more times and logged, I was tired.  <br>
   As for Alnaron he had nothing to do with this, leave him out, as well as Bingbong (yes he got his name from ESPN thingy, he loved it).<br>
   I was told the catapult was for the BFG (Brendil's Frigid Gnasher?) when i bought it.  I didn't pay 3.5k for it, but was ecstatic when the PC read it.<br>
   I have no &quot;problems&quot; with using Alnaron's account, I have been on maybe five times, and only with his permission. He is not my main, but I was prepared to use him if Ooggie wanted to duel me with his monk (of which he had bragged about a LOT). What is your name Igottoomuchgameforyou, I don't ever remember stealing somebody's account, I'm sure I would if i had. Send me a tell in game about it or something, don't just go postin on the list for nothing trying to make me look bad.<br>
<br>
I didn't lie plain and simple, I don't think I anything wrong, but i guess that's not up to me to decide now is it?<br>

You say that the whole encounter took place in under 2 minutes, yet you claim that you had to interupt the sleep of the involved friend of yours.  2 minutes and you had interupted sleep?  Your sounding fishy there, you should have stuck with the said 30 minutes it gives more time to corroberate the story your saying.  <br>

I know neither party here, have nothing to gain nor do I care what happend(goes back to the 3rd party trade thing).  If I were you I would return the items, and forget the incident.  Cause your story doesnt paint you well. <p> <a href="mailto:dreamingwolfmail@home.com"><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/bennyhills/flower/152/dwsig.gif" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utetsuharaminobu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tetsuhara Minobu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/28/01 11:24:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GREVENN...is long i warn you</span><hr size=1> I see some definate problems with his story... some of his prices and/or knowledge of the game if off for the kind of equipment he had.  <br>

&quot;I was told the catapult was for BFG.&quot; BFG is a quest done entirely in velious. Tinkering items not needed ... anyone who knows enough to know it's a BFG knows that.<br>

Lying out your ass.<br>
<br>
Proven by the fact that after you unloaded it you wouldn't take it back when the sucker who bought it found out what it was.<br>

I smell Alnaron's worldview at a minimum, if not himself.<br>

Hope you and your friends all had a good laugh at the noob you ripped off Al.

Yes I had interrupted my neighbor's sleep very quickly, but he leaves EQ on at the character log in screen and only gets off of that if he needs to, so it didn't take long to get on.<br>
<br>
And I was TOLD BY THE PERSON I BOUGHT THE CATAPULT FROM that it was for the BFG, I thought it was pretty cool so I bought it, I have no knowledge of the actual quest or what it involves.<br>
<br>
I didn't LIE about anything, I went solely off of the info. that i had been given by somebody else, i would have gladly traded back if Oogie hadn't been a total ass to me the entire time. <br>

These two agreed to a trade.  If you trade your item for one you have no idea the value of or what it is actually for then you're gonna get burned.  It happens every day at car lots and it happens every day on EQ.  I've turned down NUMBEROUS trades because I didn't know what the items being offered were for.  Shame on G for trading items he doesn't really know what are worth and shame on S for accepting trades on items that he doesn't know what are worth.  Either way this is not in my opinion a shitlistable offense.  It's at the worst bad business acumen.  But then I wasn't there..... <p>Laguer Bloodreaper  <BR>
