Anybody could do it.  HA!<br>
<br>
You know, a lot of professional atheletes have foundations set up to help fund one cause or another.  Whether it's feeding children in their hometown or supporting those scientists.  They set these up using the money they make playing sports and then rely on donations from supporters (which usually consist of fans).  And, I know in the NFL, players donate their time to volunteer for the United Way, an organization set up to help the less than fortunate.<br>
<br>
Plus, entertainment is a good way to keep your mind healthy.  It lets you forget about your problems for a couple of hours and, for me, watching football is one of my favorite forms of entertainment.<br>
<br>
I'm a little jealous at the salaries these guys have, too, but they worked damn hard to get them.  You have to really be the cream of the crop to play sports professionally and you don't get that way without plenty of time in the gym and on the field.  And then you have to live with pain the rest of your life for putting your bodies through such rigorous training and for what?  To entertain a bunch of ingrates. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 742<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/11/02 10:28:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3009.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Keep in mind also Carathos that footballers have a use-by date attached to them whether through age, injury, poor form or whatever.<br>
Don't know about American football, but once you hit 32-33 in Australian Rules it's usually time to find another job. Union players can occasionally last a bit longer, but they invariably come out of the sport 2/3rds as intelligent as they started or even less.<br>
Some go into coaching or administration, others become commentators. A lot end up on the shitpile, 30 something with zero real life working skills.<br>
<br>
So, if they make a bazillion dollars during the brief time they are professionally paid players, more power to them. If Nike, Brooks, insert-your-sporting-brand-here sponsors them, good on them. <br>
They need to secure their future. Like most people.<br>

<br>
I played American football in both High School and Junior College. I also played soccer (football to those non-US folks), baseball, and basketball in high school. I sucked at basketball so I only played my freshman year.<br>
<br>
American football is the most mentally tough "physical" game I have ever played. Also, you'd think that with all that stopping and starting, it wouldn't require much stamina...wrongo. You use quite a few muscles... you are not "pacing yourself" because you have to physically exhert yourself every 30 seconds or so.<br>
<br>
Also, even with the pads and helmet, I've seen some pretty nasty injuries... from broken ankles from cleats getting stuck in the grass when someone tackles at the legs, to hyperextended elbows at the bottom of a pile, to cracked vertabre, to whatever. Lots of concussions... without the helmets, you are looking at popped melons. Broken collar bone was common. Broken/sprained fingers was commonplace with about half the team. Think helmets work well? Well, you can still get a concussion with one on. I've seen people get hit so hard their nose was poking out the ear hole practically and the only reason we were able to get it turned back around so easily was the snot that was knocked out of the guy acted as a lubricant!<br>
<br>
In junior college, I had this guy on my team that, during practice, would slap the guy across the line in the face when the ball was snapped. I was pissed because my face was red after a while. I didn't do anything about it because the guy looked like a 6foot 6inch Scott Farcas (red hair and all). These were some mean-ass folks.<br>
<br>
Everybody wants to knock your block off. Kickoffs were the best for that. Your job is to go down the field and collide with an opposing player at full speed.<br>
<br>
So... American Football players are not wimps...except those foreign kickers we get every once in a while.<br>

Hell, some players don't know how to handle all their newfound wealth and tend to lose it.  They go out and buy the expensives cars, the big houses and all the toys and then they go out and get themselves a career-ending injury.  Now they have nothing but bills to pay.  They just aren't smart about it.  They go from college where they make jack shit (if they're honest and even if they aren't, what they get in college is shit compared to what they'll make in the NFL) to making hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.  They don't learn to invest their money so they'll have something when they retire, which is average at about 35 or lower, although there are a couple of players have hit 40 or better (including Darrell Green, who is still one of the best corners in the game at age 41).  But for the most part, if you are getting hit on every play (i.e. lineman) you don't make it past your early 30s.  <br>
<br>
Hell, at my last job (a moulding plant) we had a guy apply for a $7.00 an hour job that used to play in NFL europe league and also was making the league minimum with the Minnesota Vikings (he didn't get the job LOL).  But, yeah, it's never too early in the NFL to learn how to manage your money.  Some people can remain millionaires long after they retire, some have to go back to school so they can get a job.  You'd think that since the majority of them had college degrees, they would be ok after sports, but I never said they were the brightest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwalterscott.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walterscott</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1176<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/11/02 11:55:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3009.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

I have scars on the back of my head where I was stomped on and a myriad of little scars on my hand for the same reason. My nose has been broken a few times by saying hello to the ground or some guys kneecap in an intimate fashion.<br>
<br>
I'm 6'2&quot; and about 210lb in imperial talk, but I'm a little guy by union reckoning and I played mainly scrum half. I didn't have the build to be a proper forward or a centre or the pace to be a fly half or a fullback, but as a scrum half, manouevring a ball into a scrum that probably weighs two tons collectively can a shitload of fun. <br>
<br>
Getting the feed from the scrum and offloading it your team mates before you get bulldozed is a fun time as well. Nothing like a 270lb breakaway that can do 100 metres in 11-12 seconds welcoming you to the grass.<br>
I've been knocked out, I've been stretchered off, I've had problems remembering my name or where I was on a football field. <br>
I luckily avoided broken bones, though I've had fingers dislocated. I've been kneed in the nuts so many times I'm surprised I've been able to father children or sing baritone.<br>
<br>
And, keeping in mind, that union is an &quot;amateur&quot; sport played mainly by private school boys in Australia (which I wasn't) and uni students.<br>
<br>
Still, I had a blast playing it and I imagine an American footballer feels the same way with his sport.<br>
<br>
But, you're gonna get poleaxed, you're gonna get knocked out or dazed at the very least, your head is gonna bleed, your nose is gonna get rearranged...you get the picture.<br>
<br>
That's probably why I crack up in laughter seeing soccer players fall over and stage injuries near the opposing goal. Those guys don't know what they're missing.<br>

<br>
That's pretty funny. I saw that a lot in high school playing soccer. I played fullback and tripped some guy intentially once when he got past me with the ball, and the ref didn't call it. I don't know how the ref missed that... i swiped his feet right out from under him from behind. The guy got up swinging his fists and he got carded :)  <br>
<br>
Never heard of union. Sounds like fun. <br>
<br>
People also do play tackle American football without pads... but it is more the "pickup" variety at the local park. That can get pretty nasty as well, especially with big oxes that decide the want to play running back.<br>
<br>
Touch football is for wimps! Smart wimps, but wimps nonetheless!<br>

<br>
It is a very, very physically demading sport.  Much more that American Football.<br>
<br>
If you talking about the big guys, you will never see a rugby player who is anything like a lineman in football because if you were a big overweight dude you would last about 5 min on a rugby field.  Reason is a rugby game is almost NON-STOP, if played properly and with a ref who knows what he is doing (ie playing the advantage, letting minor penalties slide).  If there is a penalty you get about 10 to 15 seconds if your lucky then it is going again.<br>
<br>
There is no defense and offence and special teams, you are all on the field playing from the beginning to the end of the game non-stop (from what I remember in 15's it is two 45 min halfs with a 10 min halftime). If you have the ball you are on offence, if your team looses the ball and the other team picks it up you are on defence and you keep on going, no break, no changing players off the filed and bringing out the other half of the team.  I don't think that there are many linemen that play d-line and o-line in a single game.  (What is that called going both ways like that in Football, I know it is rare enough that it has a name like Ironman or something?)<br>
<br>
You will still see some huge dudes in Rugby still but they also have to have a ton of stamina to play at that weight non-stop for that length of time.  So no, you will never see a rugby player as physically big (fat) as the larger linemen.<br>
<br>
You also have smaller, faster, players who are like wide-receivers/runningbacks who are still tough as hell but not so heavy and really damn fast.<br>
<br>
I saw some stats once that tackling rules in rugby keep major injuries down to a minimum.  You can't flying tackle someone in the head like in American Football. <p>Athao Zarr <BR>

<br>
There is no real specialization in rugby. All 15 guys tackle, get tackled in return, all 15 run with the ball and pass the ball. They have positions on the field like any other code but there's no real offense/defense as it can turn to both in seconds and go back again.<br>
<br>
Only a couple of the guys are specialist goalkickers but they are usually fullbacks or centres and spend all 90 minutes on the ground doing their normal job as well. No-one holds the ball up for them and they rarely ever get to kick for goal from straight out in front of goal. You're expected to know how to kick for touch or ground advantage, but kicking for goal is an artform only a few take up. Like I said, it's usually the fullback or one of the centres, but can be anyone.<br>
<br>
You can't tackle anyone around the neck or above. At the very least you'll get 10 in the bin for it and it injures the guy, you'll be sent off. Sticking your arm out and clotheslining a guy at high speed is almost certain paraplegia, even death.<br>
You can't scissor tackle, up-end an opponent or use any other part of your body other than your hands and arms to tackle. No barging or tripping.<br>
<br>
The game doesn't stop to bring on substitutes off the bench unless it's injury related and the ref has stopped play. So, in that short space of time when you only have 14 guys on the field, a lot can happen.<br>

<br>
In the scrum, players begin next to each other and just push, pads won't do anything.<br>
When a footall is snapped, the offensive and defensive lines nail each other after gaining speed.<br>
<br>
Also, look at the way tackles are made. In Rugby, the way to tackle is to wrap a player and bring him down. In football, it is to hit the guy as hard as you can with your shoulder.<br>
<br>
But what's great is when my school's Rugby team (10th in the nation, actually. We graduates one person who'll probably join the Australian national team once he's done with college) ends it's season, every member who is in the scrum loses about 3-4 inches due to spinal compression. <p>Cthen Obsidius,

Ice hockey is the most fast, skillful and brutal sport in the world, especially brutal if you are in the corner with the puck and my buddy Darius Kaspariatis is coming in on you.<br>
<br>
I mean how the fuck do you play 82+ games a year while taking the kind of punishment that Ice Hockey dishes out?<br>

I had a few major colleges looking at me until I let my cousin talk me into playing in something they call a &quot;turkey bowl&quot; on thanksgiving day. Its basicly a thug tackle football tournament at a local community college. Basicly, I got my legs taken out on a pass route and ripped my knee to pieces.

I dunno if any of you have evry watched a Hurling (Ireland), or Shinty (Scotland) game. 15 man a side with a ball the size of a tennis ball but only slightly softer than a baseball, and armed with a wooden stick which splays out at one end to a face these guys whack/swing/clip and &quot;puck&quot; the ball (sliothar) around the field at speeds in excess of 90mph. Plus with all the swining stick around helmets are kinda reqwuired but the real men (fools?) go bareheaded. It is  normal to see guys after matches walking off with big bloodied smiles and gashes in the head.<br>
<br>
I am not saying one sport is tougher than another, they all require different skills and make different physical demands, but if you like Hockey you would love Hurling.<br>

I'm not arguing with you...but just wanted to share a story. I used to live in Texas and my Dad and I would go to Dallas to see the Texas Rangers play Baseball...but only when Nolan Ryan was pitching.<br>
<br>
During one game against the KC Royals...Bo Jackson was batting. People were laughing at him, cause he's like 0-18 against Nolan Ryan, with 15 strike outs. At any rate, he hit a fast ground ball straight up the middle that hit the bottom of the pitchers mound.<br>
<br>
It popped straight up and caught Nolan Ryan right in the jaw...he picked the ball up, whipped it over to first base and got Bo Jackson out.<br>
<br>
He stayed in the game, pitched 3 more innings...then he left and got 6 stitches inside his mouth.<br>
<br>
Nolan Ryan is my hero...<br>

He was exceptional and the greatest pitcher of all time (best in my opinion).  Now a days you see pitchers that go on the 15 day disabled list because of a blister on their hand.  With the ridiculous salaries these guys are getting paid I find it a joke.<br>
<br>
Last year in the Playoffs Steve Yzerman and Brendan Shanahan both had broken bones in their legs.  When the they were on the verge of being eliminated from the playoffs, Shanahan played, and Yzerman attempted to play but couldn't withstand the pain.  Hockey players as a whole show more heart and guts than about any other N. American professional athletes as a whole. <p><center>
