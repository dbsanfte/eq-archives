Wow lots of names I'd definitely have to agree with.<br>
<br>
The names that come to mind:<br>
<br>
Goeshen - known him since EQ day one, always willing to chat and have a good time<br>
<br>
Nelof - lots of mad times, a cleric that will walk from Erudin to Steamfont just to res a newb<br>
<br>
Sharmila - never met a funnier, nicer person in game, and she's a gnome!<br>
<br>
Bhrit - never even a cross word from this incredible person<br>
<br>
Nyllith - you've gotta love a fat man that can tell a good joke, always keeps things interesting and funny<br>
<br>
There are too many names... Arturi, Gailen, Mootet, Yenom, Saaril, Fizzlewiz, Lizelle, on and on and on..<br>
<br>

I took a few months off, and log back in to find all my tradeable stuff missing.. and I had some nifty little toys..  needless to say, it was quite depressing, so I gave my accoutn to a friend and didnt log on for another month.<br>

I gave my account to jasmina, I knew she had an extra comp lying around and thought myabe she could use itchy to lvl her twinks, since her shaman is on the same account as her twinks.  but jasmina decided to gather up my friends and start restoring me, when she found out VI would not.<br>
Now I dont want to imply that because I got new toys from people, it makes the game worth playing, I mean to say, that when I was in trouble, all my friends and more came together to help me when I needed it most.

<br>
- Kaane - my roommate, always been there, always will  . nt<br>
- Bubu - yes he can be an ass sometimes, but he is also a good friend who is always there for me when I need him.<br>
- Jasmina - has always been there for me when I really needed a friend, and prolly always will be.<br>
- Grokx - a troll, he smells, can't jump, not worth 2 copper pieces in trade but he's always there when you need a friend, a laugh or need to vent  <br>
- Revel - another person who's been in my EQ life since dirt was new, always looked out for me and one of the nicest people I have ever met, period.<br>
- Slashh / Fabkin - even tho he switched to a gnome, he's still one of the nicest people you can ever hope to meet.<br>
- the old UI crew , zack, areshop, lord helmet, bori, cikala, gumug, myrdral, kego, dinuven, gilgamel, virral ( I miss the gnome ) - pitched in for weeks helping me, and have always been there for me since I got back.<br>
- Caleborus and raelven, always making my day brighter<br>
- krass, lionfist, sharasali - people who just came out of woodwork to help me, it was appreciated<br>
- the MS and SF crews who let me tag along with them in fear / hate or wherever, I appreciated the invites and the help.<br>

<br>
Other people would have to be old friends from &quot;The Revellion&quot; back when i was playing my warrior, Aaed, who kept on telling me just how GOOD wizards were, and my many, many new friends:-<br>
<br>
Kars - GO THE BUMDANCE!<br>
Boruin - remember the oasis!!!<br>
Darkatar - my local SK<br>
Athilnaur - who helps me with my reltionship &amp; drug problems <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Anglei - crude, lewd, &amp; unashamed....it's refreshing<br>
Daglett - who always looks out for me &amp; ALWAYS has a space in group for me<br>
Magimookoo - I SUFFER POT ENVY MAN!!<br>
<br>
Then there's the people who looked after me &amp; goth when we were newberts:-<br>
Kzzern, Kanya &amp; a bunch of those &quot;old school&quot; players, although i doubt many of them remember us.<br>
<br>
Eldritch - for being my mentor &amp; a good friend.<br>
<br>
and finally:-<br>
<br>
Tripitaka, whom i lived with for 6 months, &amp; during that time, he informed us that he would no-longer be playing eq, so he traded his FBSS for a SMR for me, while i was at work &amp; had no idea.<br>
<br>
my thanks to all these people, you have all helped make eq for me, just absolutley brilliant!! i love you all!!<br>

A lot of old names listed there.  Been playing since the server opened and just found these boards.  I remember dancing with Lumindanu in Highkeep in our 20's.  Still smile when I think of Chukzombi auctioning for banded armor in his 40s.  Remember watching Zackulle killing some undead as I was laying on the ground in Kithicor bleeding to death.  I died anyway, but he tried (it's so hard to keep rangers alive).  Ahhh, the old days.<br>
<br>
Then a few weeks ago, while sitting on the rocks in The Overthere was chatting with a youngster that was on the boat.  She kept giving me loc's so I knew when to swim out to meet it, her name escapes me at the moment but it's written down at home.  Another one that impressed me lately was Zamb.  I was in WW and saw a paladin walking very slowly along the path trying to get to FV.  Zamb shouted looking for loc to goblin mine back to LOIO.  I convinced her to wait and guide the paladin through the mine.<br>

Khelidria (always up for goofing off)<br>
Atlus<br>
Solorn/Cendan (he was ALWAYS there for me)<br>
Destian (A person I cconisdered as a Paladin brotgher in my mid levels)<br>
Setis (This guy was a God to me wen I was still RPing. I became friends with him shortly after giving up RPing though, how ironic is that?)<br>
Floxx, Droxx, Winu, Odan, Torf, Jungle, and Glikon - the most organized and fun group I've ben a part of. There was nothng we couldn't do , and we never had a cleric either.<br>
the original Sylvan Guard - It was like a family to me, till things went awry.<br>
Cenoan, Minka, and the rest of the Fianna of Marr - After things went sout with the Sylvan Guard, these guys became the family SG usd o be. One day I logged in to hear hey were disbandd, and I as like WTF!?<br>

I've yet to meet anyone with as much heart who cares as genuinely about the people she meets and takes under her wing. I know nobody more generous or more giving of themselves..<br>
<br>
To Shazzie, from everyone that knows her, we love you.<br>
<br>
Kalayia comes in a very close second, but for reasons of defense against the assholes in the world, she's learned to stay just shy of being *too* generous and open (thankfully! ::snuggles his baby::.).<br>
<br>
Qyesa, much the same as Shazzie.. always giving, always supportive, always bringing a smile to the face of those who know her. Qye, we love you too!<br>

Nice people on EM</span><hr size=1> Thanks Gurglespit and Blancalupa, wow...<br>
<br>
I like to read this page like once a week and just saw this one.  Do you still play Gurgle???  I need to redo my friends list if so, that's for sure.  <br>
<br>
3 people?  No way, but I will try.<br>
<br>
Blancalupa - A person that really impressed me as being so overly caring that it must be painful for her quite often.  And her flames are cool too!<br>
<br>
Lumindanu - Didn't encounter her until relatively recently, but WOW!!!  Crazy selflessness.  She wouldn't even let me give her an earring one time because I couldn't carry it (lore).  What a pain she is!<br>
<br>
Althariel - she's my wife, what more needs to be said?  I met her when I needed help really bad, my body was stuck in front of Neriak guards, and I was nekked in Lavastorm, she offered to help me.  The rest is history, hehe.<br>
<br>
This is hopeless, cause I will miss many of the friends I play this game to interact with, but Desirae, Bullmoosin, Heavyhitter, Dabiggun, my mom, my dad, my 3rd grade english teacher, Albert Einstein........<br>
<br>
I think I got carried away.....<br>
