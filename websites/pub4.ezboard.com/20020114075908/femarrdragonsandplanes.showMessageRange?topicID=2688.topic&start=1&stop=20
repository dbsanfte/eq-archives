Here is the email that you apparently haven't gotten yet. Since you wish to have this in a public place, so be it. However, I do not feel Dragons &amp; Planes is the appropriate place -- so I moved it here. And to make this a tad easier for the public to understand, I have included both of our responses from Dragons &amp; Planes.<br>
<br>
Sagemon:<br>
As things currently stand, there is only one slot on the rotation for pickup raids. Although the rotation is binding on no one outside of the guilds in the rotation, as of now no one seems ready to ditch the rotation and turn VS into a FFA spawn. Consequently, only one pickup group will get a shot at VS per rotation.<br>
<br>
If we're going to make this work, the various pickup leaders will need to communicate with each other and share the slot. Otherwise, this is going to turn into another Nagafen/Vox situation, with different groups racing each other to get to VS.<br>
<br>
This will the third pickup raid in a row organized by CBA/VP. We won't contest you for this one, and we wish you the best of luck. Next time around, however, please communicate with us before you claim the slot. <br>
----<br>
Siilverain:<br>
Sage,<br>
<br>
First raid was organized by CBA, correct. The second raid, if you will remember, I did post specifically asking if someone else was interested in running the raid because &quot;I didn't want to step on any toes&quot; as I remember typing it. No one voiced interest in running it save VP. This time its down to a week until the spawn and no one voiced interest again so I took the initiative to plan a raid. I will gladly speak with you about future VS pick up spawns via email. siilverain@clanbattleaxe.com <br>
----<br>
Sagemon:<br>
Siilverain, it is one week until the next pickup slot on the VS rotation. You do not need an entire week to take signups for a raid with 24 to 30 members. As you point out, last time you asked whether anyone wanted to take the slot. This time, you just took it.<br>
<br>
If CBA/VP wants a spot on the rotation, you should just go and take it. However, the pickup slot is the only slot available to all of the pickup groups and all of the smaller guilds that are not on the rotation. When you unilaterally claim the slot, you deny all of those other groups and guilds a shot at VS for at least a month.<br>
<br>
The fact that other groups and guilds have not &quot;voiced their intention&quot; to go after VS by advertising for raiders on this board does not mean that only CBA/VP is interested in VS. If you treat the pickup VS slot like Nagafen/Vox with a monthly spawn, the rotation system is not going to last long. <br>
----<br>
Siilverain:<br>
Sage -- I am entirely not interested in having a fight over the boards. I have emailed you with my response. If you wish to continue this, let's do it over email like civilized people okay? <br>
----<br>
Email to Sagemon from Siilverain:<br>
Sagemon,<br>
<br>
Though it seems as if you are wishing to start a fight over this, I am not interested in doing such.  Knowing you are most likely the only other pick-up leader that could run a successful VS raid, I assumed either A) You would post on the boards your interest and that it would be a closed raid (IE: Only those on your mailing list would be invited) or B) Email me as it is well known I am interested in running VS raids.  <br>
 <br>
Yes I have always posted raids at least a week in advance so everyone will have a chance to sign up.  Unfortunately, not everyone has 24/7 access to the boards (this includes me) so it is only fair to give prior warning.<br>
 <br>
I will gladly step aside for the next pick-up rotation so that your raid group can take their shot at it.  As I stated on the boards for the last VS spawn, I have no intention of &quot;hoarding&quot; the pick-up spot.  However, if I don't recieve word anyone is interested -- I will gather the people.  Any questions?<br>
----<br>
Sagemon:<br>
I have not received an e-mail from you, Siilverain. However, I disagree that this should be handled privately. This issue involves more than just our raid group and CBA/VP. I am sure that there are other groups and non-rotation guilds that would like to organize a VS raid. If you don't communicate with the rest of us, VS is going to turn into a FFA mob. That may be inevitable, but I don't think any of us want to cross that bridge just yet. <br>

<br>
I might have a suggestion but you would need to check with the other guilds in the VS rotation as I am only the rotation keeper and not an ambassador for all of the guilds.  If CBA/VP are always together when they kill VS..perhaps make a "mini guild" as it were for the purpose of killing VS and try to get in the rotation. This way it frees up the Pickup group slot for those who are not in a more established guild as it were.<br>
<br>
But you would need to check with all of the guild leaders of the guilds...and make sure they express their approval either here or on the rotations revisited <br>
<br>

Attempting to dominate the pick up rotation slot however, isn't exactly what I would consider fair on your part.  If you've done it several times already, why assume you must take that again?  It's a spot that we all need to share and is not yours to take when you feel the urge. <p>Tormentcia

Damn good ones at that.  If you don't like the way she does it, or feel that she isn't being fair, then take some initiative yourself and organize one.  No, that doesn't mean muscle your way into the rotation, but rather be diplomatic about it and ask for a chance for your guild/team to go on this raid.  That is the distinct thing I see here.  <br>
<br>
In your posts you keep referring to &quot;small guilds&quot; getting a chance at VS, whereas Siilver is running a pick-up raid.  Who cares who runs it as long as they know what they are doing.  It's a pick up raid.  All have a chance to go and all have a chance at loot providing that they are of the sufficient level.  The fact that CBA/VP is organizing this raid is beside the point.  This isn't a guild raid, it's a guild sponsored raid.  I'm not an officer in either guild but only a member, and a recent one at that so these views are entirely my own, but as Siilver has already stated we do not have the muscle to do this with just our guilds.<br>
<br>
The pick up slot is for just that, pick up raids.  It is not for small guilds to go in and raid exclusively.  A pick up raid is open to all.  Where is the problem?   <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15641">Sayre L`Fey</a></b>

<br>
Torm- Sage asked for it.  Where else should the matter be taken if he felt it was a public issue?  He didn't want the matter dealt with in private, so Siilver did what was asked.  If you guys could be civil and work things out, I'm sure VP/CBA would be more than happy to work out an agreement- they are the most diplomatic and giving people I've met in all my time on EQ.<br>
<br>
Ettiquette and civility can go a long way.  Want something?  Be ready to ask for it politely if you want it given to you with the same courtesy.  That is all.<br>
<br>
I applaud you, Siilver.  You give me hope that humankind hasn't altogether forgetten about propriety.<br>

As Aishen pointed out, Sagemon explicitly said this was not to be handled privately.  And everyone should hopefully agree that Dragons &amp; Planes is not the forum for such an item.  I tried to be civil and mature, he chose otherwise.  Not my problem.<br>

Attempting to dominate the pick up rotation slot however, isn't exactly what I would consider fair on your part. If you've done it several times already, why assume you must take that again? It's a spot that we all need to share and is not yours to take when you feel the urge. <br>

Could you please elaborate on how exactly I am &quot;dominating&quot; the VS pickup rotation?  I have run the VS pickup rotation <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> once</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I would really like to know how you consider one run and offering to run it a second time dominating?  (And no, last time was entirely run by VP. I was merely there as a raider, it was not a co-raid) As I said above, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>no one</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> contacted me in any shape saying they were interested in running it.  <br>
<br>
If it didn't get run this time, most likely the pickup rotation would have been dropped as the last attempt was unfortunately unsuccessful.  However, if either of you had bothered to contact me (and yes I know both of you have my email address), I would have gladly bowed out and requested to join your raid.  But no, both of you would rather take this as a public insult and be children about it. Well so be it. <p>Siilverain the Wind Caller<br>

Ohh thats right he does this all the time.<br>
<br>
Well we had high hopes for him . Hell I even offered to help him camp rage fire. Course that would be seen as CBA/VP trying to take over all the ragefire camps. Or corning the market on the longest most boring camps in the game. <br>
<br>
We are trying to recruit some high level tanks for the purpose of claiming a spot in the VS rotation . However since we are a roleplaying and good aligned guild that complicates issues a bit. <br>
<br>
Does anyone else get the distinct impression he complains just to make himself look like a petty ass? Maybe that is just a side effect.<br>

I am really tired of the childish antics of some supposedly intelligent people , for your own sake take a nap when your cranky dont start a pointless argument.<br>

But you have to remember there is no point arguing with Tormentcia, she has to be right as she is never wrong, and if you dont agree with her, your wrong.  Sage will come here soon and agree with her, prolly cause if he doesn't she'll box his ears or something.<br>
<br>
Theres no way siilver is hogging the VS rotation, she posts with at least a weeks notice in a place that is very public and well known to people about she would like to do VS rotation this time, I've always read a request from her, and noone has gone there to challange it.  If you want to share with CBA/VP then there are easily available emails and contacts for them or you coulda posted a thread in general reguarding the pickup slot in the rotation saying you would like to attempt it, and maybe giving other groups a chance to post there to get in the pickup slot rotation of VS, instead of picking a fight about it.<br>
<br>
Now all I want is VS to spawn when I'm not sleeping so I get a chance to kick his lizzie ass! :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usagemonprayeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sagemon Prayeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/26/01 11:39:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS (Re: Sagemon)</span><hr size=1> I think it's interesting that Siilverain chose to move this to the Rants and Flames board (with my name in the title), rather than discussing this on Dragons and Planes or simply moving it to General.  If you read my posts on D&amp;P, which Siilverain copied here, you won't find any ranting or flaming.  You'll find the flaming in the posts by Siilverain's pals and members of VP.  Like Torm, I find that highly suspect.<br>
<br>
I'm going to ignore the flaming and actually discuss the real issues, which Siilverain's pals would like to skip over.  For those of you who would like to turn this into a flamefest, be my guest.  I certainly can't stop you.<br>
<br>
Let's start with what Siilverain had to say in the e-mail that I never received (no slam there -- I know Siilverain has had problems with her e-mail in the past, and almost all of my e-mails to her in the past few months have come back with an error message):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Knowing you are most likely the only other pick-up leader that could run a successful VS raid, I assumed either A) You would post on the boards your interest and that it would be a closed raid (IE: Only those on your mailing list would be invited) or B) Email me as it is well known I am interested in running VS raids.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First of all, your premise is false.  Although I'm genuinely flattered that you think that I'm the only other pickup leader who could run a successful VS raid, that's just not true.  Gorndax could do it.  Darmu could probably do it.  Kerna could probably do it.  On top of that, there are a lot of smaller guilds that run open raids, and they could certainly do it.  The simple truth is that neither one of us have any idea who might be interested in leading a VS raid.<br>
<br>
As for the things that you assumed that I would do, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you could have done all of those things yourself.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You did not post on the boards that you were interested in running this VS raid.  You did not send me an e-mail (which apparently wouldn't have gotten through, as it turns out).  You did not send me or Tormentcia a tell in game.  This is my whole point -- you need to communicate with the rest of us instead of just claiming the raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I will gladly step aside for the next pick-up rotation so that your raid group can take their shot at it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So after CBA/VP has taken the raid three straight times, you will generously step aside from the rotation a month from now.  Well, that's great, but it misses the point.  If the rotation system is going to work, you need to communicate with the rest of us on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the future VS spawns, not just the one a month from now.  Are you going to do that, or is this going to turn into another Nagafen/Vox cesspool?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As I stated on the boards for the last VS spawn, I have no intention of &quot;hoarding&quot; the pick-up spot. However, if I don't recieve word anyone is interested -- I will gather the people. Any questions?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, two questions.  First, how do you think that you're going to receive word that other people are interested in taking the spawn if you don't ask?  Second, why do you expect other people to come to you and tell you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> their</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> intentions when you don't go to them and tell them <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> your</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> intentions?  Communication is a two-way street.<br>
<br>
Setting aside the flames and mocking comments by Siilverain's pals, there were a few good points raised in some of the other posts.  Toein asked:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Has anyone considered a combined effort of the CBA/VP folks and the Sage/Torm teams?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's a question of who is leading the raid, not who the other members of the raid are.  I suspect that a high percentage of the people in both groups are the same.  Given the level requirements for a properly run VS raid, I had anticipated that we would depart from our usual practice and recruit a few people off the D&amp;P board.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of us who thrive on the challenge of organizing and running raids.  As far as I know, there is no loot dropped by VS that Torm and I would want.  Instead, we're looking for the challenge and excitement that goes with running a successful raid against a tough mob.<br>
<br>
Sure, VS isn't that tough for the larger guilds.  However, taking him down with a pickup raid remains a tough challenge.  The first CBA/VP attempt took four tries, and the second attempt failed.  We were planning to take our shot at VS this time, and Torm and I had actually discussed posting something on the D&amp;P board.  Instead, over a week before the spawn, Siilverain preempted us.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Simple. Get your raid there before she can get her raid there. Less talk, more action! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, we don't want to get into that kind of fight with CBA/VP.  In the past, we've voluntarily rescheduled our raids to avoid conflicts with other groups, including CBA/VP.<br>
<br>
If we're going to travel that road, we would just go ahead and treat VS as a FFA mob.  Why should we be limited to trying to KS one spawn a month when we could try to KS any of them?  We'd probably be able to get the spawn every two to three months, which would be just fine.<br>
<br>
For now, we're trying to operate within the rotation.  Under the current rotation, there is only one pickup raid slot per cycle.  CBA/VP has claimed that slot three times in a row.  If we have to bring the rotation system crashing down to get a shot at VS, we will do so with regret. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

<br>
I'd like to interject the topic of character here in this discussion.  In this capacity, I speak for myself and my guild; and I swear by and vouch for my allies and friends.<br>
<br>
We're not camp stealers or mob hogs.<br>
<br>
We have experienced the game through the beauty and camraderie of pick-up raids.  When we're part of the team, we follow our raid leader and intend to do so with distinction and with every spirit of fair play and fun.  When we lead raids, we take upon ourselves the responsibility for everyone who goes in, knowing they must follow our lead.  We don't push it past safety when we're leading them, and we do our best to ensure safety when we're on them.<br>
<br>
My point here is, please be assured we understand both the spirit, the trials, the tribulations, the beauty, the hard work, the pains-in-the-butt, and the compromise that pick-up raids are about.<br>
<br>
At the same time, we are guilded and allied, and are aware of what that implies.<br>
<br>
I promise you, we take the duty of walking the line between those two facts very very seriously.<br>
<br>
So my point is, we do not and shall not have any intention of &quot;hogging&quot; the pick-up rotation slot.  When our time comes, we will go by the rules established by the community in securing a slot when we are ready and able.<br>
<br>
And until then, we will continue to serve to the best of our ability the duties of pick-up raiders.  That means willingly giving ourselves in to the compromise, trials, tribulations, etc that pick-up raids implies.<br>
<br>
I picked up the ball on the last rotation because it was in danger of not happening.  I took it upon myself, on behalf of all the pick-up raiders on the server, to make sure the effort against VS went through on the last rotation.  I understood that I was doing it to preserve the purpose and spirit of the pick-up rotation; I was not doing it for VP and CBA, every VP person present understood that, every CBA person present understood that.<br>
<br>
I think, more accurately I would hope, that CBA and VP have earned that credibility.  Raid leaders from CBA and VP who host pick-up raids adhere to the spirit of pick-up raids.  We don't approach pick-up raids as power trips to beef firepower onto exclusive guild-alliance events.  We have worked to create that kind of integrity.  I would hope you all already knew that.<br>
<br>
So please folks, don't worry about us trying to hog up the pick-up rotation.  We know what it's for, both the intent and the spirit, we have and will always adhere to those principles.<br>
<br>
If and when we gun for a slot in the rotation, we'll do it by the rules, without abusing the pick-up rotation as a means to our own selfish ends.  We're just not like that.<br>
<br>
I think you already know that.  Now, if you can find it in yourselves to have some faith in us as people and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> believe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it, I think you'll find you have nothing to worry about.<br>
<br>
Yes, what we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> know</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in our heads and what we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> believe</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (ie. what comes out of our mouth) isn't necessarily the same thing.<br>
<br>
We've never had beef between us before, and I don't think we need to have any now.  I'm not trying to invalidate anyone's concerns here, only to make all the facts known for your consumption.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I wish best of luck to whoever leads the next rotation, and if I'm able and willing to make it I'll sign-up with everyone else and do my part.  I think you'll find that VP and CBA will do the same.  We're just those kinds of people, and I'm really happy about that fact.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Could you please elaborate on how exactly I am &quot;dominating&quot; the VS pickup rotation? I have run the VS pickup rotation once.

<br>
When Torm said &quot;you,&quot; I think she was referring to CBA/VP.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, if either of you had bothered to contact me (and yes I know both of you have my email address), I would have gladly bowed out and requested to join your raid. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you're going to make a big deal out of the e-mail address, let's review some history.  You are actually a member of our mailing list group.  A few months ago, I started getting  an error message for you every time we sent you an announcement.  For example, I got this one on September 22:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----<br>

<br>
We discussed the problem at some point, and you gave me a new e-mail address.  It worked a few times, then I started getting an error message again.  For example, I got this one on November 20:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----<br>

<br>
In other words, we do not have your e-mail address.  But that's really beside the point.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> could just as easily have contacted <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> us</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But no, both of you would rather take this as a public insult and be children about it. Well so be it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really?  Who moved this discussion to Rants and Flames and put my name in the title?  And whose pals and husband have been flocking to this thread to take silly potshots at me and Torm?  With all due respect, I think that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have taken this as a public insult and that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you and your pals</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are being childish about it.<br>
<br>
Crom, who is Siilverain's husband, predictably joined the chorus of flames from Siilverain's pals.  I loved his opening line:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And the pointless argument award this week goes to Sagemon.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hey Crom, if the argument is so pointless, why don't you just tell your wife to drop her raid plans and take the spawn next month?  After all, this is all pointless, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Finally, a quick response to Submina, who was banned from our raids and removed from our mailing list because of her conduct on a couple raids.  Submina, you have been trying to get a rise out of Tormentcia ever since that happened.  Hopefully, Tormentcia will continue to ignore you.  I tried my best to work things out diplomatically, but obviously I was wasting my time.  If there was any remaining doubt, you have now burned your bridges. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

<br>
The Dragons and Planes board is a place to sign up and organize.  An argument of sorts was ensuing there.  Rants and Flames is the place for arguments.  <br>
<br>
I think Siilver was right to move this discussion here instead of cluttering up the raid list with an argument.  <br>
<br>
As for the argument, I really don't see the reason for one.  I mean, to be cliche...Can't we all just get along.  <br>
<br>
Sagemon, I don't think Siilver ever said &quot;Sagemon cannot attend this&quot; it IS a pick-up raid.  <br>
<br>
CBA/VP will continue to run pick-ups until we have the components for totally guild raids.  When we are prepared, then we will, I'm sure, work for a spot on the rotation.  <br>

Now, everyone just hug and make up!  <br>
