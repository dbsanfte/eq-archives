The others of her guild never understood why she stayed at an inn in what was called the Foreign Quarter by some, and a nastier name by others.  They wanted little to do with outsiders.  What they didn’t realize was that outsiders carried information, and information was an invaluable tool to her profession.   She got many a job from the events that happened in the world, and learned to avoid other, more hopeless causes that way as well.  Yes, the inn was seedy, its keeper dubious, and the food a risk to eat in itself, but to one who had just traveled for two weeks in constant rain it was as grand as the royal palace.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How she wished she could jump out of her muddy armor this instant, settle by the fire in her room, and drink some of the wine of the only home that she knew.  The Sarnak’s had used the Neriak ambassador’s temporary absence to wage an assault on the outpost of the Overthere.  The fighting lasted for a week, and the attack was finally beaten back.  She had earned the respect of the general of the forces stationed there, the admiration of her comrades in arms, and more importantly, 100 gold coins for her effort.  Now she would have two weeks to herself, two weeks to rest and recuperate before her next assignment.  She made a note to check in with her superior and mentor, Aedeb, to find out if her services would be needed.  She was sure he would let her have the vacation, but it never hurt to check in with the Cimmerii.   <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She left the stairs and entered the darkened hallway.  At this late in the evening, everyone would be fast asleep in his or her beds, unaware of her arrival.  Good, she thought, it was best to stay out of the public eye, much safer that way.   You never know which pair of eyes belonged to one of your enemies, waiting to ambush you in the shadows and back alleys of Neriak.  She had certainly done so, and eliminated many a foe that way.  It was one of the games played in the life of a sword for hire.   She crept down the hallway, and paused at her door.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Light seeped through the cracks underneath the door to her room.  Someone was in there, when she was expecting no one.  Perhaps it was Aedeb, here to give her next assignment.  Or perhaps someone else.  Vaguely she remembered the innkeeper telling her as she made her way to the stairs that one of her kinsman, a dark elf was inquiring about her.  He gave her a physical description of a man in dark purple robes.  She didn’t recognize him.  When the innkeeper began to rant over the absence of one of his serving girls, she left to go to her room.  Perhaps the stranger returned.  She held the hilt of her sword in her right hand, ready to pull the sword out of the sheath at a moment’s notice.  And if that failed her, she had one more trick that Aedeb had taught her, a deadly surprise that aided her in more than one battle.  With her other hand she placed the key into the hole and turned it.  She heard rustling inside as the lock clicked.  She placed her hand on the doorknob and turned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She squinted as light shone into her eyes.  She made out the form of a Tier’dal man in violet robes, leaning back on a chair with his feet propped up on the small table by her bed.  As her vision cleared she noted the small smirk displayed on his face.  No, she didn’t recognize him at all.   Nor did she care for him taking over her room.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He looked into her eyes, and said, “Lithiano Kai`ahna, I presume?”  He nodded his head.  “I figured that you would wish to be warm, so I started a fire for you,” he pointed to the roaring flame at the hearth.  “I hear you have been on a journey.  I too have traveled from afar.  Come, sit and have a drink with me,” he said, gesturing to the two goblets before him, next to a bottle of wine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano frowned.  “Who are you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Forgive me.”  He put his feet on the floor and rose from the chair.  “I am Zanifer Mali`Kyre.”  He bowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve never heard of you.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He grinned.  “No, I see no reason why you should have,” he replied.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How did you get in here?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He nodded his head in the direction of the bed.  “I had a serving girl let me in.  You can find her over there.”  He sat back down in his chair.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano approached the other side of the bed.  She noted the frozen expression of astonishment on poor Lily’s face.  She remembered the times in the past when she would come home to the inn after a battle, only to be bombarded by Lily’s incessant questions.  Lily always wanted to go out and see the world, perhaps take up the sword and follow in the footsteps of the great Lithiano Kai`ahna, the Iron Maiden of Nektulous.  Lithiano never had the heart to dispel that dream, to tell Lily the truth about what an adventure was really like.  About the constant fear that each breathe you took could quite possibly be your last.  Now Lily was dead.  She had a gaping hole in her chest, the sides cauterized by flame.  Magic, Lithiano thought, remembering this Zanifer’s robes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “W-Why did you kill her?” Lithiano asked, hiding the tears she felt were about to poor out in raw emotion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I wanted my arrival to be a surprise for you.”  He turned his head to look into her eyes.  “Do I detect a note of sympathy for the girl?” he questioned mockingly.  “Sympathy from the great Lithiano Kai`ahna, the Lady of Battles herself?”  He laughed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sadness gave way to anger.  “Of course not. Only that the innkeeper will be searching for her.  An inquiry will be made. You’ve given me a lot of trouble.” She scowled at him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The disappearance of a mere human wench will hardly warrant any questions here,” He stated matter-of-factly.  “Just give the innkeeper a little money for his troubles and he will forget that he ever had a serving girl.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano slowly nodded her head.  It was sad, but very true.  He wouldn’t care, that is if he had gold to keep him silent.  Lithiano had to do what a soldier must to do every time a comrade was lost in battle.  She had to calm herself, and marshal in her emotions, so that she could think with clear head.  After a moment, when she felt composed and resolute, she lifted her head and turned her back on the body.  She looked back to the magic user, “so what do you want?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come, sit,” he said, pointing to the chair.  She came over to the chair and sat next to him.  She lifted the goblet of wine to her lips, and pretended to sip it.  He never touched his.  She noted that it was still full.  Best to play it safe.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He relaxed in his chair.  “Tell me, Lithiano, does the name Rastor mean anything to you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano nodded her head.  “A human mercenary, a decent enough warrior.  Better with a mace than a sword, and a better than average commander.  Our paths have crossed on more than one occasion, sometimes we fight on the same sides, other times we fight on opposing sides.”  She looked into his eyes.  “What’s your point?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your paths have crossed?  What a delightful way of saying that you fought each other in a duel.  Tell me, is that all he means to you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We’re mercenaries, we go where the money is.”  She tapped her foot impatiently on the floor.  “I repeat myself, what’s your point?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sighed with exasperation.  He looked intently into her eyes.  “That Rastor does not feel so nonchalant about you, Lithiano.  He does not like women,” he looked down at her sword, “especially those who carry swords.”  He returned his vulture’s gaze to her eyes, as if appraising his next meal.  “You defeated him in a duel, humiliated him in front of everyone.  For that he means to have his vengeance.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So be it. I defeated him once, I can do it again.”  She put steel to her voice. “When the time comes I’ll finish him off once and for all.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He shook his head, and leaned forward from the chair.  “It’s not that simple, Lithiano.  At least, not this time.”  He tapped his finger on the goblet.  “Rastor has thrown his lot in with the Freeport Militia.  He is moving up in the ranks to captain.  He has won several significant battles against the knights.  And what respect he can’t earn he can now buy.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano smirked.  “Rastor’s a fool.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer shrugged.  “Ah, but a dangerous one.  As I said, he has always wanted revenge for his defeat at your hands.  And now he has the means to get it.”  He leaned back in his chair.  “As of now he has hired ten of the best sell swords and cutthroats that he could find in Freeport, and offered fifty gold coins to each of them for your head.   They were to travel here, under the guises of ambassadors to the King to try and form an alliance with the Militia.  Once they snuck in they would make queries and search you out.  They would’ve found you, rest assured.”  He glanced behind him, at the window.  “I imagine that the alleys behind this here inn would be a perfect place for an ambush.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano’s hackles raised.  She was good with a sword, more than good even.  But ten trained assassin at one time?  Not even Aedeb could handle those odds.  And they could be lurking anywhere around Neriak.  Could she reach the Cimmerii in time for help?  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She asked, “And what part do you play in all this?” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer touched his lips with his finger.  “Rastor took no chances this time.  If the men were to fail, I was to finish you off myself.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano slammed her gauntleted fist on the table.  “You break in here, murder a   girl and wait for me to return only to announce you have come to kill me!”  She glared at him.  “You’re the fool, Zanifer.”  She rose to her feet, removing the sword from her scabbard.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now, now, Lithiano.  I am no longer here to kill you.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then why are you here?” she demanded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The assassins are dead.”  Lithiano looked at him doubtfully.  He said, “it’s true, I killed them myself.”  He paused, and gestured for her to sit back down in the chair.  She hesitated for a second, and then returned to her chair, laying the drawn sword on the table next to her.  Finally he continued, “As I said before, I have traveled far to reach Neriak, with the assassins for my party.  We arrived here a week ago, and all of us were tired.  The men asked around and discovered that you frequent this inn.  When they heard that you were spotted in Nektulous, they planned to make the hit tonight, right before you reached the inn, while you were fatigued from your journey.  It would be an easy hit for them.  Because they knew that they would have to leave Neriak before your body was discovered, they decided to celebrate their success prematurely.  They spent their money on all the booze they could buy last night.  The drunken fools were easier to kill than she was over there,” he waved his hand in the direction of the corpse.  “I didn’t even have to waste my power on any of them.  I just cut their throats with my dagger, and watched them bleed to death.  You’ll find their bodies in a room overlooking the Marketplace.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano had a puzzled look on her face.  “Why did you kill them?”<br>
<br>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Because,” he said in a quiet voice, “I want to join the Cimmerii.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What?” exclaimed Lithiano in disbelief.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You said it yourself, Rastor is a fool.  He concerns himself with petty squabbles, mere wealth and political power.”  Zanifer sneered with contempt.  “I seek the true power, the power that the gods wield.  That is my only purpose to this existence.  That is my only desire.”  He looked intently into Lithiano’s eyes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So what does that have to do with the Cimmerii?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A far off look came to his eyes.  “Only that you have gained my Master’s attention, an honor in itself.  He is impressed with the deeds of the Cimmerii, and the valor and power as demonstrated by her members.  Unlike Rastor the Cimmerii concern them with a greater purpose, and have served the Prince of Hate quite well.  And although my Master’s will is different from that of the Father God, you have also served his purpose albeit indirectly.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Your Master?  Then you don’t worship Innorouk?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer cackled.  “Me worship hate?  A fine jest indeed.”  He shook his head.  “Nay, I do not serve Innorouk.  Have it his way and we would all be his mindless slaves.”  He turned and pointed to the fireplace.  “Look to the hearth and what do you see?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano rolled her eyes.  “I see a fire.  So what?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer stared into the roaring flame.  “I see the essence of creation when I look into that flame.  I see the primal spark of life that forged this world from a desolate wasteland into a magnificent creation.  I feel the energy and passion that reside in all of us, that lust for power and life found in all our hearts.”  His voice grew quiet as his gaze lingered to the hearth.  “I see the energies that consume everything in sight.  I see the essence of destruction as the flames consume all that is around them, the logs upon which it feeds, the air that which it breathes.  I see the life and death struggle in that fire, the hunger for life, the thirst for existence.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sighed, and returned his gaze upon Lithiano.  “That is my Master, that is the only reality for me.  Love, hate, light, and darkness, they mean nothing to me.  All that exists is that primal struggle of the flame, the will of my Master, the Burning Prince.  It was he that showed me this truth, it is his purpose that I serve, and no other.”<br>
<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So you are a wizard,” Lithiano stated.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer nodded absently.  “Yes, my calling is wizardry, the purest power of evocation, the greatest ability in teleportation.  I have heard that the Cimmerii have been bereft of a wizard for quite sometime.  That is indeed quite a shame, for we do have our unique abilities.”  He smiled with satisfaction.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I will admit that that is true, Wizard,” Lithiano acquiesced.  “However, if you think that we will allow you to automatically join, think again.  To join the ranks of the Cimmerii one must prove his worth to our nobility, he must prove his valor in battle, and succeed in tests of pain and endurance to show that he is worthy of wearing the blood sash of the Cimmerii.  And finally he must prove to have loyalty that is undying, to the Cimmerii as a whole and to all her followers.  I may sponsor your membership to the guild, but that doesn’t mean that you will be able to join.”  She leaned back in her chair, crossing one booted leg atop the other.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An eager gleam set into his eyes.  “I will prove myself to you, Lithiano.  You will see.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano smiled.  “I’m sure that you will.”  Still smiling, she placed her right hand on her booted foot, pretending to massage it.  In reality her fingers searched for the tiny trigger found in the arch of the boot and pressed it.  A miniature dirk sprang from a tiny slit in the side of her boot, and flew straight for the wizard’s head.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp SWISH!!!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano looked to the wizard, expecting to see a mangled mess where his face once was, and gasped with surprise.  The three-inch blade hovered in the air, an inch away from his face, which was still intact.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer grinned.  “I believe this is yours?”  The dirk gently flew back to the table and lay down next to her sword.  “Does this mean that I passed the first test?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano gave a slight bow with her head.  “Very good, Wizard.  But do not think that your next trials will be handled so easily.  They have only just begun.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer rose from his chair and gave a delightful chuckle.  “I’m sure they will be quite entertaining, to say the least.”  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lithiano followed his suit.  “I will speak with the others and see how they feel about this.  I won’t promise that we will let you in, but perhaps we can at least test you.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I eagerly await them.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We will see about that.  For now I must go and speak with my mentor, Lord Aedeb.  I will know his answer tomorrow night.  Where can I find you to bring you his answer?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Zanifer shook his head.  “So that you can bring assassins to my doorstep to see how I handle them?  I think not.”  He smiled.  “I will come to you here, at this time tomorrow night.”  He reached down underneath the table and brought up a burlap sack.  “I thank you for this opportunity that you have given me, Lithiano.  Here is my gift to you to show my appreciation for your efforts.”  He placed the bag on the table and stepped across to the middle of the room.  “I have a feeling we will get along nicely together, Lithiano.  In time we may even begin to trust one another.”  He delivered a stiff formal bow to her.  “Till then, Aluve Lady of Steel.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aluve, Wizard.”  Lithiano said, walking over to the door to open it for him.  Then a gust of wind blew open the windows, and Lithiano ran to them to lock them tight.  When she looked back to see the wizard, he was gone.   Sighing, Lithiano sat back down in her chair, and stared into the dying fire.  The room began to darken with the waning of the flames.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This was certainly an unexpected surprise delivered at her doorstep.  Ever since the departure of Naos the guild had been eager to seek out another wizard to join their ranks, but to no avail.  Wizards were difficult to recruit, for they were an arrogant lot to begin with, and demanded an enormous amount of honor and prestige laid down at their feet.  They always believed that they deserved more money and respect than were allotted to them.  They vied for power, and scheming for political prestige was second nature to them.   It could all be traced back to the Age of Twilight, a long time ago when magic was the supreme force in the world.  Wizards had more power than could possibly be fathomed, and ruled the world with an Iron fist.  They had mastered the power of time and space, and used them to shape the world as they saw fit.  And woe unto those not born with Wizard’s blood in their veins, for they were thought to be primitive, inferior, a beast that needed to be guided by the enlightened hand of the supreme force.  Lithiano shivered.  A dread time indeed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some of the others would approve of the wizard, while others would dislike him immensely.  Archaon would surely hate him, for the necromancer thought wizards to be pompous and overbearing.  Lithiano agreed with him somewhat, the Age of Twilight was over and the Age of Steel had begun.  The wizards had squandered their great power in endless battles against one another; slaves were pawns to help further their masters’ great ambitions.   It was only when the primitives finally had the numbers to turn on their masters that the wizards joined together in an alliance to defend their order.  Still, it was too late, for the wizards had managed to whittle away their numbers until too few of them existed to squash the rebellion.  The great power of wizardry was crushed, much of the great knowledge and power lost in the destruction of their Towers of Power.  Those wizards who survived the war hid from the victors and secretly sought any remnant of the knowledge lost in the war.  Over the centuries their numbers grew, as did their knowledge and power, developed secretly over time.  But alas, even the most powerful wizard could never match those of the Age of Twilight, for now swords and steel were the dominant force in Norrath.  Order was enforced by great armies of warriors, and kings ruled the lands, not wizards.  Still, magic could be found in Norrath, and casters branched out into new fields of magic.  Wizards eventually became a part of the new world, and soon gained the respect and fear for their power, if love.  Yet, many of the wizard’s grew arrogant and bitter toward those that they saw to be beneath them, and believed them equal to the gods.  In Lithiano’s opinion only half of them earned that right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still wizards did have their uses.  Besides their powerful destructive magic, wizards could teleport themselves and their party throughout the world at will.  An entire army could travel the length of Norrath in mere seconds, a benefit all commanders could appreciate.  As an added bonus, armies did not have to depend on the surrounding territory alone for supplies.  The wizard’s could purchase goods from afar and deliver them to the forces instantaneously.  Lithiano smiled, yes, this wizard could be quite useful to the Cimmerii.   <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A stench permeated the room, and Lithiano traced it back to the sack the wizard had laid down on the table.  A gift he said, something to show his appreciation for her aid.  Curiosity overcame her caution, and Lithiano severed the top of the bag with the edge of her dirk, pulling the wrappings down to the tabletop.  Staring at her with lifeless eyes was a human head, cut off from its body at the neck.  Rastor, Lithiano thought with a smile of satisfaction on her face.  Yes, this wizard could have his uses.<br>
