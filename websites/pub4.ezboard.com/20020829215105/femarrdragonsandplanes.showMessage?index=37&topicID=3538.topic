<br>
Yay! Great impersonation of Dariah, by the way...<br>
<br>
In regards to the women versus men driving ability argument; I think both of you are right, but you're pointing out two different arguments.<br>
<br>
From Maerah's standpoint, it is facetious to determine one's driving ability based upon their sexual anatomy. This is of course without getting into the argument of women versus men in regards to hand-eye coordination, caution, daring, and other psychological evaluating factors.<br>
<br>
From Jellystud's standpoint, women <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> bad drivers. Not that all women are, but in the grouped assumption women, as a gender, are poor at operating motor vehicles.<br>
<br>
I think both of you are right. This is of course my opinion, and is very gender biased, but seems to be a reality from my experience with both sexes. As Ky pointed out, all races, sexes, and nationalities are not equal.<br>
<br>
Stereotypes are relatively valid. That's why they exist.<br>
<br>
Just think, this whole argument could have been avoided if vacuums had been invented with four wheels, instead of two. =P<br>

Watch for it on 60 minutes or some other popular show that lieks to bring people the facts.<br>
<br>
A while back I was riding in a car with a friend and his girlfriend. She was driving, and cruising down a street at night, when the lights ahead turned yellow. She didn't slow, she hit the gas. by the time she hit the intersection the light was red. I knew right then that we were busted. there was a cop in the turning lane of a crossing street, and his lights went on and he came after us. she saw the lights, panicked, and started to pull over 6 feet from a crosswalk at another set of lights on one of the busiest streets in the city. I told her to pull onto the next street and into the empty parkinglot there, she stopped soon as she turned onto the street, leaving just barely enough room for the cop to park and not have his ass out in the street.<br>
<br>
cop came up, she put on her pathetic sad face, and said &quot;I thought I was a lot closer to the light, oh no, oh gee, I'm sorry&quot; I knew she was gonna get away with it, I knew it. cop asked her if she had lots of money, she said &quot;no, I'm poor, oh no, I'm sorry, ohhhh&quot; and the cop said to watch out next time and not go through lights. he sounded really angry at her too but let her go.<br>
<br>
days later another girl friend did the same thing and the cop let her off too.<br>
<br>
I hear of such stories like this all the time. girls doing dumb things and not getting ticketted, and continuing to do the same stupfid things.<br>
<br>
Then there's me. 11 pm one night, cruising down the same street, empty of cars. I am doing 60km/hour in a 50 zone, and I have 1 burned out headlight. cop pulls me over, tickets me like $110 for the headlight (which I got out of by fixing it and showing them at the cop station) and he ticketted me $40 for going 10km over the speed limit.<br>
<br>
I was perfectly courtious. waited patiently, called him sir, etc. etc. I even pulled into an empty parkinglot so we didn't hold up traffic or anything (a robins donuts parkinglot no less) and he still ticketted me. this was my first time ever being pulled over.<br>
<br>
Anyways, my theory is that many more women get pulled over for stupid things, but the cops just tell them to be more careful next time, and let them go. The lack of tickets, in the end, lead people to believe that women get pulled over less than men do, because men are getting pulled over and ticketed for 10km over here, 15 km over there, a headlight out here, a yellow light being run there. This is why I am paying $175ca a month for my 1992 4 door family car, without collision coverage. This is the cheapest I have been able to find, and I am 23. I had 1 minor accident many years ago due to a kid running in front of my car and some old guy hitting me, but my insurance is CHEAPER now than it was back then. Meanwhile a lot of chicks pay $500 per year, and many pay less.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I know 1 chick who drove her parents van into a river while reaching for lipstick in her purse, and another was at staples, tried to hit the brakes, hit the gas, panicked, tried hitting the brakes again and mashed down the gas AGAIN, drove the car up a cement divider, and careened off through the wall of the staples I used to work at :P<br>
<br>
Anyways, that was my theory... discuss :P <p>If I was an Everquest character, I'd be:<br>

<br>
Except, I don't think insurance rates are based upon tickets involving age/gender groups; only accidents. This is of course my assumption, I could be completely wrong.<br>
<br>
However, I do think that womens lack of accidents has a lot to do with how many more men work than women. A study I saw once said an alarming part of accidents were caused by people speeding to work. So, if more men drive to work than women...it stands to hold some reason.<br>
<br>
Then of course you have my personal problem with the fact it would be morally unconstitutional to raise insurance rates on someone for their race, but it's ok for their gender and age grouping.<br>
<br>
Now, I realize insurance is relative to the amount of risk involved, but there is a large gap between men age 18-25 and women age 18-25 involving insurance rates. For one, women get a tax break at 21, men don't until 23. I think they get another one at 19 from 16, but I'm not quite positive.<br>
<br>
Of course, men pay these exorbiant insurance rates so they can go to work to increase the accident polls to increase the insurance rates ad nausem. It's a vicious cycle.<br>
<br>
And further more, what's up with requiring insurance on people, and then not allowing a government standard. While I agree liability insurance should be a neccesity, it it a moral crime to force people to pay these HUGE rates, without some subsidized alternative.<br>
<br>
I mean, I pay 200 dollars a month for liability because of my age range, and I have some tickets. For liability!<br>
<br>
Bah, I'm done rambling.<br>

I have been pulled over twice for speeding and have been written two tickets (I was as nice as could be and very respectful) one of the tickets was for going 36 in a 35, I got that one thrown out of court.<br>

My sister has been pulled over 5 times (that I know of) for speeding, zero tickets, once she was doing 55 in a 35 construction zone.<br>

You guys DO learn!  And Nekiah, insurance rates do involve moving violations that deduct points from drivers licenses, such as running a stop sign or speeding over 11mph over the speed limit (at least that's the limit in good ol' Georgia).<br>
<br>
My ex-girlfriend (I can call her that now, she told me it was over about 3 days ago) got pulled over for passing on a double yellow - no ticket.  Got pulled over for speeding and a missing headlight - no ticket.<br>
<br>
I get pulled over for an expired tag (2 days expired) and I got a ticket.  I got pulled over for 11mph over (I got lucky) and I got a ticket.<br>

Statistics based on observation is not the same as Sexism...<br>
<br>
It may have been poorly worded, but Female (especially teenage female) drivers tend to be horrific drivers. <br>
<br>
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL WOMEN ARE BAD DRIVERS<br>
<br>
But its means that a large percentage of women drivers are sub-par. And Maybe YOU aren't a bad driver... good for you, but that doesn't make up for all the dumbasses around you that are giving you a bad name.<br>
<br>
For once why doesn't someone @#%$ do something about the problem rather than bitching about the people that are observing the problem because they are not being politically correct?<br>
<br>
Politically Correct is a joke these days in any case... Waiting hours in an airport because Racial Screening is so terrible is not the way to be doing things.<br>
<br>
No, I don't think all &lt;insert race here&gt; are terrorists, but narrowing down a small percentage of the population to aid their search instead of being indiscriminating with searches (just an example) when they could be more effective with racial, sexial, age-oriented (fakk is that a word?) and other kinds of screenings is stupid.<br>
<br>
Hell for one thing, it would make airports faster for everyone. Not just those who didn't have to be searched.<br>
<br>
But Hey! thats what i think, how about you? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=180420> Elaen</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 506<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/19/02 10:01:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3538.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTF?!</span><hr size=1> I don't know any studies on &quot;bad&quot; driving, but statistically the most <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> dangerous</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> drivers (most likely to be involved in accidents - especially serious/fatal ones) on the road are young men.<br>

A police officer pulled a guy over for speeding and the following exchange took place:<br>
Officer: May I see your driver's license?<br>
Driver: I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my 5th DUI.<br>
Officer: May I see the owner's card for this vehicle?<br>
Driver: It's not my car. I stole it.<br>
Officer: The car is stolen?<br>
Driver: That's right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's card in the glove box when I was putting my gun in there.<br>
Officer: There's a gun in the glove box?<br>
Driver: Yes sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed<br>
the woman who owns this car and stuffed her in the trunk.<br>
Officer: There's a BODY in the TRUNK?!?!?<br>
Driver: Yes, sir.<br>
<br>
Hearing this, the officer immediately called his captain. The car was quickly surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver to handle the tense situation:<br>
<br>
Captain: Sir, can I see your license?<br>
Driver: Sure, here it is ... It was valid.<br>
Captain: Who's car is this?<br>
Driver: It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card ... The driver owned the car.<br>
Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if there's a gun in it?<br>
Driver: Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it ... Sure enough, there was nothing in the glove box.<br>
Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was told you said there's a body in it.<br>
Driver: No problem ... Trunk is opened; no body.<br>
Captain: I don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the glovebox, and that there was a dead body in the trunk.<br>
Driver: Yeah, and I'll bet he told you I was speeding, too! <p>----------------------------------<br>
