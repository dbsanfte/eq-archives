He doesn't. Instead he lies<br>about it. Here's an excerpt from ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; with Sam Donaldson from<br>August, 2000:<br><br>Donaldson: I'm told, and correct me if I'm wrong, that Halliburton, through<br>subsidiaries, was actually trying to do business in Iraq?<br><br>Cheney: No. No. I had a firm policy that I wouldn't do anything in Iraq - even<br>arrangements that were supposedly legal.<br><br>I guess ABC doesn't have much of a budget for research, because Sam Donaldson<br>failed to cite any sources or documents to challenge Cheney. (Who was it who<br>&quot;told&quot; Sam about the deal? A cab driver? The janitor? Didn't ABC have documents<br>or other sources? The deals, after all, were public and had to be cleared by an<br>international sanctions committee.)<br><br>Can't you still hear the press crying &quot;Liar Liar&quot; at Al Gore every time he got<br>some irrelevant detail wrong? Here Cheney tells a blatant lie about a matter of<br>national security--and gets away with it. So much for the Liberal Media!<br><br>Incredibly, Cheney recently had the gall to support a ridiculous GOP ad accusing<br>Tom Daschle of supporting Saddam Hussein.<br><br>As Bush's approval ratings sag we get closer to another war with Iraq. What is<br>the reason for this next war: to protect national security or just to get Bush<br>back up in the polls? If Iraq is really such a threat, then why did Cheney<br>supply it with crucial technology?<br><br>We can't rely on the media to tell this story. But here are three things you can<br>do to get the information out:<br><br>1) Please forward this email to as many people as you can.<br><br>2) Email Tom Daschle's office and tell him it's time to take the gloves off and<br>start hitting back.<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://daschle.senate.gov/webform.html">daschle.senate.gov/webform.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>3) Help out with the GWBush.com radio ad project. GWBush.com is producing a<br>professional radio ad with the facts about Cheney's support for Iraq. We've<br>found a cheap way to do this ($500 or so). Once produced, this ad can be<br>forwarded around the Web as a sound file and perhaps if it's a hit we can raise<br>funds to get it on the air during the 2002 and 2004 campaigns.

Email us to get<br>involved:<br>info@gwbush.com<br><br>In times like these, when the press won't do its job and the Democrats have<br>their heads in the sand, it's up to regular citizens to get the truth out.

The only question will be what phoney 'attack' will CIA use to try to muster public support ? Maybe a staged Iraqi 'strike' on one of our ships ala Gulf of Tonken ? George Sr. always preferred stories of the 'bad' guys raping our women ala Manuel Noriega when he wanted to stop running dope for us. What's a guy to do ?

We also gave warning to end the war before dropping the bomb on Hiroshima.  After dropping the bomb, we gave another chance to end it.  Japan (now a good ally) refused.  We dropped another bomb on Nagasaki which put an end to that part of the war.<br><br>Once again, we were attacked.  Once again, we responded.  As a former US Marine, civilian casulties are understood to be a part of war.  The attack on the trade centers was a terrorist act.  Our response was war.  We also do our best to avoid civilian casulties.  We could have turned Afghanistan into a crater.  Instead, we are going cave to cave searching for Al Queda.  Our war wasn't with the Afghanis.  We want the people responsible.  At the same time, we are doing our best to aid the people there.

My view on him was that he simply rode his father's coattail to the presidency.  George Bush today isn't the same one that was elected president.  Look at his eyes during his next address.  This has changed him.  When our nation was hurt and sorrowful, he stepped up and did what he needed to do.  You say he's milking 9/11.  I say he's taking care of our nation in light of the 9/11 attack.  He's trying to insure that it doesn't happen again.  You say he needs to earn your respect, I say he HAS earned mine.<br><br>When you have given your time, stood along a wall in some godforsaken corner of this globe, signed away your very life in defense of this great nation; then feel free to talk about what happens in war.

Let's break this down a bit.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> While Dick Cheney was its CEO, Halliburton sold more <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> technology</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to Saddam Hussein than any other U.S. corporation. From 1998 to 2001, at least two Halliburton subsidiaries sold Iraq <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> $23.8 million worth of oil industry parts and equipment.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Notice how the author uses the sexy term &quot;technology&quot; to imply that something important was being sold.  The use of that term brings to mind the scandals involving technology thefts by China.  But then the author says that the sale involves &quot;oil industry parts and equipment.&quot;  /yawn<br><br>And it was only $23.8 million worth.  Anyone who has a background in the oil business can tell you that $23.8 million in oilfield equipment isn't a huge amount.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> These deals were arranged by Halliburton and routed through subsidiaries to avoid political exposure. More than any other U.S. company, Cheney's Halliburton helped Iraq restore its ability to earn the money to develop weapons of mass destruction.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Talk about some tortured logic.  Is this author suggesting that Iraq couldn't produce oil without some parts and equipment from Halliburton?  News flash: American companies are not the only manufacturers of oilfield equipment.<br><br>Oh, and notice that the author talks about avoiding &quot;political exposure.&quot;  He never even suggests that the transfers were illegal.<br><br>You can find this sort of stupidity on both ends of the political spectrum.  Use your brain when you read this stuff. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>High Priest of Quellious the Tranquil<BR>A Twist of Fate</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umaeri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maeri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 9:35:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=277.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraq (nothing to do with EQ)</span><hr size=1> Pearl Harbour: a military target. unprovoked.<br>Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki: civilian targets. in a time of war.<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.doug-long.com/rambling.htm">www.doug-long.com/rambling.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.dannen.com/decision/">www.dannen.com/decision/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>anyway, two wrongs doesn't make a right.<br><br>Figures on Afghani civilian casualties:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cursor.org/stories/civilian_deaths.htm">www.cursor.org/stories/ci...deaths.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1740000/1740538.stm">news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english...740538.stm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Afghanistan 7 Oct to 7 Dec: conservatively at least 3767 civilians<br>WTC+Pentagon, 11 Sept: estimated 2998<br><br>Whilst looking around for this, I bumped into this article:<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1214-01.htm">www.commondreams.org/views01/1214-01.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>which relates some of my concerns as to the wisdom of the whole war on terrorism. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2386<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/19/02 9:55:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=277.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Iraq (nothing to do with EQ)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  When you have given your time, stood along a wall in some godforsaken corner of this globe, signed away your very life in defense of this great nation; then feel free to talk about what happens in war.
