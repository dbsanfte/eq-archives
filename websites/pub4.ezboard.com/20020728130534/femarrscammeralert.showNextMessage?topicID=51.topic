Interestingly enough my freind was on as one of his twinks at that very same time and has only one account.  The transfer he was setting up was that I give him my GEB's and his primary would give me the pair that he had on him later.  Only he did not fully get thru his pitch before my freind logged in his main that he was pretending to be and confronted the scammer which caused him to immediately log out.

Saw two things that it wanted that were lore on me.<br><br>2 Used a second character (some one that had a name like Xyras)to ask me about who our guild leader was. Xyras said that Starx had said to it to ask me about the guild leader's name.<br><br>3. A little while later, I got a tell from &quot;Saraguael&quot; saying, &quot;Do you know who this is?&quot; My reply was that I thought it was a new bard we had in the guild. It said, 'huh'? I said 'no, I'm not sure of who is this. Is it Sara?' and it said 'Yeah, I need some help with a transfer before I log on my regular account. This is my new mule and I need to transfer a fbss and css to my mule from my main'.<br><br>I told it that they were both lore and that I couldn't do the transfer but that Syp was at WC and I could get him over real fast. It stated that it was running late for getting to dinner and to just give it my fbss and css and it would log on it's main and give me the fbss and css back. I told it that I trusted Sara (our guild leader) but I didn't 'know' for sure who I was talking to, and that I'd get Syp over here in a flash to do the transfer. I then camped while it protested. I had Syppin on and was running when I telled it that I was almost to EC and it said it had to leave for dinner really fast and couldn't we just to the trade it's way.<br><br>At that point I decided to go for broke and asked it was Sara's real name was. It said 'huh?' and I asked it what my real name is. It's reply was 'your name is @#%$' and it logged. I did a /report Saraguael and camped Syp after telling guild chat what was up.<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Apparently the person does his research on the gear of the people he's mimicking (think many of us have our profiles on caster's realm). He does not however research how the person actually behaves.

And several people, including myself have been taken by it.<br><br>It happened to me in this way: I was in Gfay Auctioning a Book of Obolous for trade for some item. After a few minutes I get a tell from an anon char acting all &quot;buddy buddy&quot; to me. When I asked them who they were they told me they were xxx, who just so happened to be an old friend of mine. I take it they saw that as an opportunity to heighten their scam. They sat and chatted with me for over an HOUR near the bank. He told me that he hadnt been playing because of RL problems and that he was getting bored with his main and wanted to start a caster. After about 10 more min he tells me that on his main he has the item that I'm looking for and that if I would trade him the book he would log on his main and transfer me the item. I am very hesitant for a while but he gets increasingly persistant. Finally he calls over a random person and we all group up. He tells me its for &quot;assurance&quot; so that he would prove its really him. So I tell the xtra person to log all of this, and i do too. I traded him the book and he told me he'd be right back which his main/my old friend. And of course he didnt. I /reported but all the GMs said was 'we'll look into it'. Ah well I guess it was my fault for falling for it, but some people must me sick to sit with someone for over an -hour- BSing.<br><br>But again a similar thing happened to someone, this time the scammer told the person that they were someone in my Guild, and they scammed some poor person out a wurmslayer.<br><br>Moral is: Trust only your friends, and dont be like me and fall for scammers like this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Derrit Traenem<br>The Mad Ranger<br>Officer -
