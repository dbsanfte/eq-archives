Normally I would keep my nose out of this pathetic squabbling since I had suggested in the "SECOND" post on what could be done. It would work just as well with Sagemon getting a set group and attempt for his own slot either way. I guess it is more fun to squabble.<br>
<br>
I have a few comments..<br>
<br>
"Submina, you need to tred lightly. You know what you did to get yourself thrown out of our raiding, and we have kept it all private. However, if you would like us to bring out the facts, we shall, but I don't think you want that to happen."<br>
<br>
Tormentcia do you have nothing better to do then cast threats at people? Are you and whomever you raid with the only ones in the game that raids? I dont think so..if Submina wants she could find someone to raid with. I do so love the ending sentence there...making threats over pixels. Facts according to whom I wonder? <p>~In the end, it is all a game..and Verant owns our soul~<BR>

I'd do that this afternoon.  However, I see that Submina managed to provoke Tormentcia into a response, and that a couple people are foolishly jumping on the Submina bandwagon even though they have no idea what they're talking about.  Snuggums I can understand, because he's an idiot.  Aamrie is a different matter.<br>
<br>
Aamrie, I don't know what Torm ever did to you to provoke that response.  However, try to open your mind for a moment and listen to me.<br>
<br>
Go talk to anyone who attends our raids.  Ask them whether we make a practice of banning people from our raids over trivial matters.  Most of them are probably unaware that we have ever banned anyone from our raids, and very few of them will have any idea what happened with Submina, because we haven't publicized it.  In fact, Submina is only the second member of our mailing list who has been banned from our raids because of conduct during a raid.<br>
<br>
We have severed our ties with Submina, and frankly we don't care who she raids with now.  We do not intend to go into the details of what happened for the reasons that Tormentcia stated.  If you disagree with us, that is your right.  We're comfortable with our decision.  We just ask that you not throw gasoline on the fire.<br>

Rugger, I think the original pickup raid was led by someone from LoF, though I could be mistaken.  Whoever it was, they disclaimed any interest in running another one. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

You two are so bloody ignorant and egotisical I only wish you the worst of luck.  What I heard from Submina about why you severed ties is pretty pathetic, and the fact that you even mention this on the boards as an attack to Submina is pretty low.  I hope your idea of a VS pickup raid isnt the same as your 8-9 group raid to fear last night.  Underconfident are we?<br>
<br>
Only thing I agree on is that Siilver posted in a way that basically said VS is mine, and didnt contact others or ask if anyone else had intentions to do so.  I am one that wont run over someone elses raid, and thus I did not want to say &quot;VS raid, 1 hour before Siilvers&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>

I dont think so, so I express my concerns to sage and then torm about this, cause to be honest I was unhappy with his presance back on the raid, and I'm basically told by torm she dont care, guys ok by her and &quot;get over it&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now I think I deserve a little more respect than that, ok, so I might not be one of the leaders of the raid, but I've been with sage/torm and the crew since about when it started, been to just about every weekend raid that I could do and supported torm and sage thoughout this pickup groups life, and what do I get for it? A kick in the teeth and told to &quot;get over it&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I arguee with sage and torm about this and it gets quite hot headed, I'm very pissed at them doing something like that to me and torm politely informs me I'm using our friendship!  Some friendship torm when invite people who are total shits to your friends on your raids which you watched is it?<br>
<br>
I arguee the toss, and since its proven knowledge here you cant arguee with torm or sage, I loose, for argueeing with them and having my own point of view, they sever all contact with me, next time I speak to tormentcia, she tells me she has no reason to talk to me, so dont say I burned any change of making up with you guys.  Banned from their raids, treated like dirt, taken off their mailing list and banned from torms/vets guild that I used to be a part off.<br>
<br>
Got it out in the open torm now?  Happy with your treatment of one you called &quot;friend&quot;?  I dont really care if this is out in the open in a public area, not gonna cause me to loose any face, and as for our mutual friends this wont effect them in any way more than they are upset about this arguement in the 1st place, and many of them said they dont like they way you treated me.<br>
<br>
So thank you for kicking me in the teeth after I was there for for you guys, real classy move. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umalamberih.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MalamberIH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/28/01 11:31:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS (Re: Sagemon)</span><hr size=1> Submina, Tormentcia;<br>
<br>
You know that I care about you both as friends, so I'm going to say this:  Do you know what your problem is?  Text.  Plain and simple.<br>
<br>
You two had a good friendship there.  And now it boils down to two forms of communication; Real time chat (text) and these bloody shit throwin boards.<br>
<br>
Both of you have no idea what you've lost with each other because frankly, as much as I do care about both of you, you're also two of the most stubborn people that I know in game.  I say that with the best of intentions because it's that stubborness that put you into this situation to begin with.<br>
<br>
For everything that I have heard on this subject, I had ZERO intention of getting involved.  But the constant pokes back and forth is just making me sick.  It's hard to see friends do this crap.<br>
<br>
How hard is it to accept error?  Who's error you might ask?  Both of you.  In some way or another, you are both at fault.  It doesnt matter where, but you are.<br>
<br>
I have no idea if you two would ever be able to make up and come to grips with the fact that everyone has the ability to admit fault and forgive.  But at this point, I am begging.  Not necessarily for you, but for those that are your friends together.<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Gorndax;  I was stunned by your post there.  It's too bad you feel that way.  Obviously you don't know many of the people you are referring to fully.  Granted, it takes time to get to know someone.  But above and beyond, I personally though I knew you to be noble enough to be above such a petty rebuke.  I'm sorry that I was wrong.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against you at all.  In fact you do, and most likely will hold a lot of respect from me.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
To all;<br>
<br>
Does anyone here at all, and yes, everyone, realize that there are actual people on the other side of the board?<br>
<br>
I doubt any of you would stoop as low as you have if the situation were placed upon you first hand.  Respect and decency in spite of heated opinion is completely lost here.  Only very few people in this thread have shown that they are observing from a rational perspective.  Siilverain is one.  And yes, even though you may disagree, Sagemon is as well.  To see this, you must look at the words of his post and not place what you think is your interpretation of his meaning.  he's not trying to spite anyone.  He is attempting to be contstructive, however, the interpretation is completely lost on most of you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Once everyone learns that emotionalless communication such as e-mail, boards, chat, et al, will inevitably result in wavering interpretation, then we will all be able to converse like civilized people.  Until then, why are you all even posting?  Be the good people that you are, and not this that you have shown.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for those that have sat through this speech.  Sorry for the length.  Guess it goes back to emotion again. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27492"><img src=http://inferno.wittsend.com/smw/sig.jpg></a>

As far as Subby and Torm go.. that's hard for me to even try to think about because yes, both are friends of mine. I refuse to take a side in it.  The only one in know in game more hard headed then the 2 of them is me.. gah a fine grp we made. heh.  I digress....<br>
<br>
As far as VS rotation, there is only a simple lack of communication for whatever reason.  I would hate to see VS go FFA over all this like some people think it should.  Maybe if one leader per say was delegated in the pick up groups rotation or 2 leaders.. whatever, and everyone who needs to go goes.... just my 2 cents... <p><font color=magenta>Fori Shadowmoon</font><P>
