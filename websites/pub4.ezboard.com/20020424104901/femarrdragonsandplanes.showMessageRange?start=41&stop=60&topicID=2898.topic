<br>
To all others questioning the calibre of people in MC you may speculate all you like, but for the most we are a tight knit bunch of people who respect each other and help each other without a second thought, it's just a pity some people see us as a stepping stone to their epics. Maybe we need to look at some type of new policy to stop shit like that happening but really I would hate to introduce anymore rules than we allready have, like a point loot system, personally I think point loot systems suck. They may work for some guilds but it's not something that I want to see introduced to our guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umeg26.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meg26</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.theglobe.com/zackulle/10PIXEL.JPG" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#E9D756>(1/14/02 12:03:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2898.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guilds that poach high level players..

It's amazing how many people I see use this excuse to leave a guild after they have gained their epic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Cleptors epic was gained by the poor bastard breaking his back to get it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What what? he did his epic all by himself? Maybe he did bust his back for it, but I am sure many of his ex-guildmates were busting their backs right along beside him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If people move on be happy for them<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Usually I am happy for people to move on, it just seems that 90% of people get their epic and then move on and that's a different story.<br>

FUCK  YOU!</span><hr size=1> I've noticed this thread run hot and cold in emotion.  I'm not trying to jump into that, just trying to share my own observations.<br>
<br>
I head up a younger guild.  I have no real concept of big or small in terms of overall headcount.  Our highest active player is level 56, and our roster spans the level range downward (with main chars, not just subs and twinks).<br>
<br>
And although it is a game, I have a role in my guild that I take seriously.  We're a family kind of guild, and I give it my best (which is sometimes more and sometimes less than what our guildmates perhaps need or deserve).<br>
<br>
I care about these people, initially from what they experience in-game but often in their real-lives as well.  Well, that's who I am, and it's my choice to be me.  No one forced me to carry a cross and receive lashes.<br>
<br>
I remember the first time we lost a guildie to a higher guild.  I was really quite unprepared for the shock.  This is the first time I've played a game of this scale, with levels of interaction that it affords.  I've been on the Internet for over 12 years, I've seen fad chats and muds and irc and usenet and all that stuff come and go in and out of fashion.<br>
<br>
But the first time I lost a guildie, what a gamut of emotions that was.  A sense of betrayal of sorts.  A certain indignation of wondering if the individuals knew or had any clue the impact of morale, firepower, etc that their departure would have on the guild.<br>
<br>
As luck would have it, it was a younger player.  I guess I should explain a bit.  Without divulging my age, I can tell you that I'm old enough to not have to renew my Selective Service.  You can glance at my pic on the Real Life forum and try to guess, whatever.  Color me weird, I'm funky about my age.<br>
<br>
But I digress.<br>
<br>
It was a guildmate who was being played by a teenager.  Oh, I made a good public show of it; well-wishing, talking to everyone about what was happening, keeping a pulse on the general impact of the departure, etc.  You know the drill, after someone gets canned or axed at your company, you can bet that everyone in the blast radius of being affected calls staff meetings, whatever.  Or they time the announcement for an All-Hands meeting, etc.<br>
<br>
Well, public appearance aside, I was rather indignant.  Swore to myself that I'd make damned sure not to recruit anyone under the age of 25 unless they demonstrated extraordinary maturity.  You know, rationalized how bad apples will screw up the works for everyone.  Moaned to myself how I didn't really have time, patience, or inclination to deal with the volatile decision making process of a lootwhore kid.  Second-guessed their family background, etc.  Having held management positions in the past, I thought about how I should have axed the player before letting them resign.  Funny that, as if they had violated a non-competition agreement or some crap like that.  Blah blah blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
When my nice and rather gratifying fit of self-righteous indignation subsided, the following scenarios went through my head.<br>
<br>
Have you ever had a friend that got married?  You know, had that weird feeling of betrayal?  It's a mixed bag.  If they were really your friend, you truly did want them to be happy.  And you wanted them to go out and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> what made them happy.  But there is this kind of self-righteous foreshadowing on your part that you know your relationship is going to change.  You know, you can't hang out with them as often or do the same things.  So you feel this odd sense of abandoment, like they are choosing to discard some of the funnest elements of your friendship.<br>
<br>
If you want to consider the idea of feeling used, say perhaps this friend of yours had been a fuck-up, you'd bailed them out of lots of scrapes, etc.  And here they have the godawful cheek to abandon you.<br>
<br>
Maybe you resent them in the long-run, and let the friendship die.  Or maybe the friendship changes, it's a big life change after all.  Maybe you stay close, but in different ways.  Or maybe you drift apart, still with fond memories of what you mean to each other (or what you meant to each other), but the magic that kept you close is gone.<br>
<br>
No matter what, the answer to your questioning, the truth that will put your indignation to sleep, the kick that will help you keep your friendship or say &quot;buh-bye, have a nice life&quot; is held in a single line of questions.<br>
<br>
&quot;How true a friend is he/she to you?  And how true a friend are you to him/her?&quot;<br>
<br>
If they are a true friend to you, that essence of your relationship stays.  And that bond may be enough to keep you close through the years.  Or it may not, but you'll still be close in your hearts.<br>
<br>
If not, well, it was just a coincidence that happened to hasten your parting of the ways.<br>
<br>
If you are a true friend to them, you will understand what they're going through and accept it.<br>
<br>
If you are not a true friend to them, the best you can do is tolerate it and play games in your head to forgive them their sin, this way in which they aggrieved you.<br>
<br>
It really is that simple.  Use whatever combinations and permutations you choose on those four outcomes.<br>
<br>
The same for losing a guildie.  At least in a family guild.<br>
<br>
Oh what you choose from that point on is up to you.  Be more stringent about who you recruit, perhaps.  Impose conditions on induction into your guild.  Work out in your head what the strikes are, kick em out after strike three or whatever.<br>
<br>
The people you lose in your guild, whether they leave on their own for an uberguild, deguild themselves because they weren't happy, left the guild because they went to go play DAoC, wanted ph@t l3wt wasn't getting it fast enough, were removed by an officer for some reason, got married and couldn't play anymore, whatever the reason were just not committed to what you were committed too.<br>
<br>
It really is that simple.<br>
<br>
And no, it doesn't necessarily make them evil.  And even if they were, what's the point really?<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that you're better off without them, flip em off, tell them some choice words and remind them not to let the door hit them in the ass on the way out.  Not at all.<br>
<br>
I'm saying that because of what they wanted, and because of what <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wanted, they weren't &quot;meant&quot; to be with you.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying karma is going to bite them in the ass like Lockjaw on a level 10 naked newbie.  It might, it might not.  And it has little or nothing to do with you if it does or does not.  I mean karma, not you walking around ruining their reputation for all time.<br>
<br>
For all I know, my little story that supported my indignation was true.  Maybe they were some spoiled piss-ant kid with pimply face and no love life to speak of, who therefore had a loot mentality to gratify their lack of social acceptance in school.<br>
<br>
And if I was right, so what?<br>
<br>
I've got a goal that I'm committed to.  That goal is personified in my guild.  I am guilded with people with similar desires.  If and when we no longer share those desires, our relationship ends.  If they fuck me in the ass on the way out or not, que sera sera.  I can't stop it.  And really, it doesn't do me too much good to get pissed about it and whine.<br>
<br>
Well, since I know the indignation isn't too healthy to maintain (is somewhat cathartic to get it all out once in a while though), here's my thought.....<br>
<br>
If they wanted uberleet stuff right here right now, my guild wasn't the one for them; so more power to them.  And in that case, they weren't the one for us either.<br>
<br>
And if I honestly liked the person, but we just had different goals, well then...  Either our friendship adapts or it doesn't.  Either way, no sin on my head.  And I'm not going to have a stroke as I throb a forehead blood vessel everytime I think about what a selfish jerk the person was.<br>
<br>
As it happens, one of the folks who left us is still a friend.  Is still the same cool person they always were.  They stay in touch from time to time, send tells, etc.  Our relationship changed.  They're not a current active guildie anymore.  We don't banter in guildchat anymore.  We don't do the same things anymore.  But they're still cool people.<br>
<br>
The others just kind of...  disappeared.  No animosity, we just don't do the same things in the same places with the same people anymore.<br>
<br>
So in the long run, who got hurt?<br>
<br>
No one.<br>
<br>
If I lost a friend who wasn't really a friend, or in this case lost a guildmate who wasn't really a guildmate, what did I lose?<br>
<br>
If a friend moved on to greener pastures, satisfying their game goals and timetable (which of course I reserve the right to disagree with), then they're happy right?  So I should be too right?  Even if I miss them, right?<br>
<br>
The world, in my experience, is full of people I disagree with and can respect.  And is also full of straight-up jerks.  And is full of some cool people who I can only take small doses of.  And is full of wonderful folks that I hope are a part of my life (in whatever capacity I choose to involve them in my life).  And I get to choose what they mean to me.<br>
<br>
Each of us has that right and power to choose.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading,<br>

FUCK  YOU!</span><hr size=1> Being in a guild that I joined at about level 21 which had at best maybe a handful of level 50 plus people at the time, I can understand where Dread's coming from.  Though perhaps not on the same scale due to the fact that epics have only recently started becoming obtainable for us, but along the same principal to be sure.<br>
<br>
About a year ago we had a merger with another mid to high level guild which turned into a trainwreck.  Mergers can be a very ugly scenario as you suddenly have a large influx of people you don't know, and might not have the same sense of decency, respect, trustworthyness, etc, etc as the people who have made the guild what it is.  As a result we had a few of our key high level people leave (joined MC as a matter of fact, how ironic is that?  ;) ).  The guild was in quite the state of turmoil.  When you lose your only 50+ cleric, chanter, and mage in one fell swoop it kind of puts a damper on the expectations of where it looked like your guild was heading.<br>
<br>
Them leaving made a lot of people feel angry, sad, betrayed, whatever and to an extent justifiably so as they were considered friends by all and we thought they would be there till the end.  However at the same time I still reluctantly could understand the reasonings behind why they left, as at times I even had thoughts about it too and for the same reasons.  But, I just couldn't bring myself to leave the people I had gotten to know.  I am proud of my guild and what it stands for, and want to see everyone who takes on our guildtag get as much out of the game as possible.  Believe me, we still have people who get to a high level and then jump ship, and quite frankly it still pisses me off.  But, I guess some people just don't have the integrity to see things through as most in our guild do.  At one time I would have gotten bent out of shape about it but at this point all I can say is oh well, they obviously didn't have what it takes, or do they deserve, to be a part of something so special.  <br>
<br>
Let them be random_buttonpusher_945 in the uber guild of their choice, riding on the coattails of others success.  If that's what makes them happy then more power to them.  To me though, nothing can compare to the feeling of the guild I've been in since I was a pup taking down their first "uber" mob (relatively speaking of course :)), or doing their first plane raid together, or what have you.  Those of us that have had the determination to see through the hard times are finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and as we look around we see those that helped us get there as well as new friends we've made along the way.  That in itself is more rewarding than any phat ToV lewt I could ever dream of having.  The way I see it there's basically 2 types of people in a guild.  One that says what can this guild do for me, and the other that says what can I do to help better the guild?  The people who say the latter are usually the ones that you can count on.<br>
<br>
On a side note, this weekend we did non-stop raiding all weekend.  We started in DN till we got wiped from a particularly nasty trap in the Chetari caves, picked ourselves up then went to CoM and spanked all the reavers plus Lord Ghiosk and Neh Ashir (sp?), then went to Skyfire and beat up on the Guardian Wurm hacking and slashing our way to him (no 55+ mage in our guild yet for CoTH's :p).  Then next day we did an 8 hour stint in Kael Arena (at one point we had 2 prots then a Veteran popped on top of us, was quite excited that we spanked them with only a couple deaths hehe), and ended that day by killing Ixiblat Fer for the first time ever for one of our clerics.  Several months ago I don't think all that would have even been possible for us.  Each time we raid together we learn more about each other and what our roles are, and walk away much more cohesive than when we came in.  That to me is what being in a guild is all about.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm basically trying to say in all my ramblings is that people come and people go, but it's the ones that stay that really make the difference.  Take it from someone who joined a guild at level 21 that couldn't even raid Droga without getting wiped out.  Persistance pays off.<br>

I myself remember talking to Dread some time back when a few MC joined us.. and yes.. they were also friends of mine when *I* was in MC.  *I* left MC for personal reasons and yes dropped my MC Tag to join RoD.  I wasnt lured away by anything more than the fact 99% of my friends.. and my boyfriend of 6 years was there.  Were there other reasons I left.. yes.. again related to friendship and the fact i needed to cut game play.  <br>
<br>
I have friends in MC still.. i have other friends that left MC.. yes.. some are in RoD, many more are in Affliction.  I dont know of one person thats in RoD because they didnt join because THEY wanted to.. they wanted to be with friends.. and what have you.  Not one that i know of was told.. &quot;phat lewt&quot; <p><font color=magenta>Fori Shadowmoon</font><P>

FUCK  YOU!</span><hr size=1> Some people are all about the loot.<br>
<br>
They don't care who they walk on to get the loot.<br>
<br>
Some are about the relationships that they make. They could care less about the loot.<br>
<br>
Some are about the challanges that lie along the way. Big mobs, little mobs in numbers. Big mobs in number. Hard ass corpse recoveries. <br>
<br>
<br>
Some are about the juggling of 30 people all with thier own goals and ideals, focusing that mob and turning them into a group bent upon one path.<br>
<br>
All people have a little bit of each in them. The parts that are dominant lead you on your journey through EQ.<br>
<br>
Having a player leave a guild due to unhappyness. Is one thing<br>
<br>
But having a player leave right after using the guild to obtain items is something else entierly. Ask yourself this question. Are you losing a quality player? One that is a true friend/guildmate? Or are you losing someone that in the long run you would be better off without. And what is the other guild gaining. A person who can make a differance? Or simply a person who wants loot at all costs.<br>
<br>
Much like stealing a girlfriend away from another man. there should always be the possibility that another will come along and steal her away from you.<br>
<br>
Think about it.<br>
<br>
Someone who jumps ship for loot alone is someone you are better off without in the long run. It stings. It makes you question what I did wrong. What did the guild do wrong.  But much like someone who will sleep with anything at anytime simply for the satisfaction of having sex (leaving wreckage in thier wake) the guild hopper is simply a Slut. <br>
<br>
A guild slut if you will. Nice to have around (free sex is good) but watch for the baggage that comes with it. And be prepared for the slut to move on to the next shiney toy.<br>
<br>
Getting people Epics is a good thing. Even getting people Epics that have low moral fiber is good. Even if they leave you know you have the calibre of people to work for each other and obtain a goal. Just next time look over the guild listing. Notice the guy that sits in the back. never complains, never asks about loot, never does the major fuck up. Go get his epic next. Not the new guy that just came in and his ass is afire with epic frenzy. Because odds are the guy with the rocket up his ass is just going to shoot to the next level anyways, not even noticing the people he is leaving in his wake.<br>
<br>
A little saying in buisness. Be careful who you step on on your way up. You may see them again before long. And heaven help you if you see them on your way down.<br>

OK, that makes sense.  I guess I'm just a bit unclear on what this rant is really about.  Is it really about people being &quot;recruited&quot; for other guilds, or is it about people using MC to get their epics and otherwise reach the membership requirements for other guilds?  I totally understand the anger over people using a guild to get epics (or other loot, levels or whatever)... for that matter I understand being angry about people being recruited for bigger guilds.  I just don't see a difference between being contacted by an officer of a guild and being contacted by a friend in that guild.  It's all the same to me, someone gets invited to apply and they do.<br>
