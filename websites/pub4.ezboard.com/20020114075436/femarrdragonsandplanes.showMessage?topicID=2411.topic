You are fully entitled to feel irked by it but I am rather curious as to why it bothers you… is it because you do not like the people and wish them gone, is it because you think that is a hypocritical action, is it because you think they were only looking for sympathy and did not really want to quit.<br>

I have no desire to see others leave.  But i hate when people screw with others emotions.  I really believe if you are going to do that (leave), just quietly do it.  Give your stuff to those in need, or those who have been good friends, and leave.<br>
<br>
If it is that hard, don't bloody well leave.  (makes sense doesn't it?)<br>
<br>
And i truly despise that some people do in fact prey on others emotions for no good reason, be it intentional or otherwise.<br>
<br>
In Sartre's story about the student who asks him if he should go to war or stay with his sick mother, he says that he (the student) already knew what decision he (sartre) was going to make.  I find the prolonged goodbyes are sometimes for the same reason, basically to get a desired response from others.  Be it that they will miss you or of the &quot;please don't go!&quot; variety.<br>
<br>
I really despise the &quot;look at me&quot;  syndrome.  @ tm... all right reserved.     hehe<br>
Basically, i really feel that some people just want the darn attention.  Get real and get over it.  It is a bloody game.  Another one is just around the corner.<br>

<br>
1. In game things get me to a point where I really dont want to play again, I post that I'm outa here, I dont wanna give away all my stuff etc, because its too damn hard to just throw away 2 years of my life like that.  Some of my good ingame friends who know my e-mail write to me and talk to me and convince me to come back into the game.<br>
<br>
2. I come back for a week and and once again driven to hate being in the game, for a most noteable reason of one of the people who asked me to come back, was very very shitty to me, so I very annoyed post that I'm leaving again, which I do.<br>
<br>
3. My current standing, is trolling these boards, cause quite frankly they are one of the funniest things around to read, I also keep my character active to do the *1* thing that I still enjoy in the the game, and thats raid with my buddies sage/torm who both were very supportive of my time where I was upset with people etc<br>
<br>
I may come back to the game once I've had times to think about about it and if I want to come back, knowing that for the 1st real time in the game I have people who really dont like me, which was something I always tried my best to avoid, I always wanted to get on with everyone and have a good time, thats gone now, and I gota reassess my needs from this game.<br>
<br>
Both my posts about leaving were made when I was very annoyed at people and the game, and thats why they were made, when people I know /telled me in game asking me not to quit, or that they were happy to see me about made me keep my account open, its nice to know people care about you.<br>
<br>
If you think I did it for attention etc, get a life, and I really dont care for your opionion, because the people who know me, know that I would not and have not done it for that reason. I did it cause I was unhappy with the game. <p>Submina Dominatrix<BR>

<br>
But really, telling me to get a life for posting?  Fuck off you single minded, short bus riding shit flingers.  If that is a retort that you can be proud off, we have nothing left to say to each other.<br>
<br>
Submina, why would you assume that I was singling you out?<br>
Rather harsh of you isn't it?<br>
<br>
BUT<br>
<br>
Since you brought it up, admitted doing it, and basically confirmed a theory, why are you mad at me?  I am not screwing with people.  You said you were leaving and you then in this very forum admit you did not.  Moreover, you accuse me and get mad at me.  I do not understand.  I have been upfront, honest, and open.  I have deceived no one.  I have stuck to my guns and been completely honest.<br>
<br>
On to the others.<br>
<br>
Who is the anon poster one is referring of?  Surely it can't be me.  I have been in the game for quite some time, and a lurker here for just as long.  Only recently did I start posting though.  On a related thought, why is it that many of the high level posters think that if you do not have a 50+ character think that you do not count?  Just because one is not HARD CORE does not mean that one is not human.<br>
<br>
But what do i know.  As i have seen here in the past, logic is only met with Anger.  I guess people do fear what they don't understand.<br>
<br>
<br>
In summation..... I was not attacking ANYONE personally.  I had no one particular person i was &quot;after&quot;.  Rather, the concept in general offends me.  I realize that this is a flame board, but I did not flame a specific person, yet was personally attacked.  Oh well, what can one expect in here.<br>
<br>
Maybe i should threaten to leave the game.<br>

<br>
Please read the second sentence of my original post.<br>
<br>
I stated quite clearly I thought, that I disliked people who did it anywhere.  You know, anywhere?  Is there a language difference between you and I.  I will gladly take the time to explain further if you require.  Just let me know.  I will not respond to anything further until that simple part in understood and recognized.  <br>
<br>
It is equally irritating to see someone play for the crowd in EC or any other zone as it is here.  We have all seen the &quot;Good bye cruel EQ&quot;... or &quot;So long suckas&quot; shouts.  We all know it happens.  So please, as i have stated, remember line 2 before saying anything further.  Breaking the whole thought down in to segments dilutes the meaning of ANY agrument and is unfair to the speaker and the listeners. <br>
<br>
As someone said elsewhere in this thread, life circumstances can require one to quit and come back and that makes perfect sense even to simple little me.  However, some people are just Hot Heads who quit whenever things get bad, then come back shortly after.  That is MANIPULATIVE and unhealthy.  Read one of the posts in this thread very carefully. Someone  (who shall remain nameless as there is no point in me making this personal) stated that.......................<br>
<br>
Quote mine-----<br>
<br>
&quot;Both my posts about leaving were made when I was very annoyed at people and the game, and thats why they were made, when people I know /telled me in game asking me not to quit, or that they were happy to see me about made me keep my account open, its nice to know people care about you.&quot;<br>
<br>
End quote-----<br>
<br>
<br>
That seems to me that the writer stated they were quitting, yet were still in game, and &quot;un-quit&quot;  That to me is not being fair to others, or honest.    <br>
<br>
Now as to Submina.<br>
<br>
Please understand that while I disagree with the come and go routine, I do respect you as a person.  If you and i where around, i would have no problem with helping you out, or even goofing off in character or out, in game or out.  Please do not take personal offence.  However, seeing that you probably already have, I am sorry.  I did not mean to single you out, and the circumstantial evidence pointed out by you and others is unfair at best.  If any one else saw something in a post that set them off they would likely not take so much heat as I have, but I am ok with that.  I realize that you are very liked, and I have no personal problem with you at all. I have a history of pointing out things that annoy me instead of waiting until I blow my stack.    I recalled after reading your good bye post seeing you in game the very next day, so i was a little miffed.  I think I was so angry as I had grown to liking your posts in here.  At times you could be the voice of reason, or the playful teaser and genuinely enjoyed reading your posts.  regardless, what is done is done.  Again, sorry.<br>
<br>
I await any and all responses.<br>

<br>
Don't bullshit around here, pal.  Your initial post was an emotional reaction, written in such a way as to provoke another emotional reaction.  Furthermore, if you had been thinking about this at all you would have had to realize that people who had quit and then come back would be upset with this post.  If you want to post flames, go for it.  Don't post this BS about logic, trying to come off as smarter than other people.  This sort of doublespeak is just as manipulative as the behavior you are describing in your post.<br>

I'm more disturbed by the &quot;insert non-pc&quot; word here flaming.<br>
<br>
Not that &quot;short-bus&quot; isn't a good flame, but it's a bit overused, especially in this forum, and I personally only like to see it whipped out by a select few people.  Same with EAD.<br>
