My post was in no way a flame towards Riders as a guild, but a mention to bring their attention to the matter. Riders representation on this thread from an officer as to dealing with the matter has been pretty good, so this only does well for their image. If they chose to ignore it, they'd be doing themself a disservice.<br>
<br>
I see a large difference between flaming an entire guild for one persons actions, and mentioning who the persons guild is so that action is taken.<br>
<br>
This can be related to threads dealing with SA members. Some people tend to take one action and generalize the entire guild as a whole which would condone it... that is a flame. Some people bring up the guild name so that it puts pressure on the guild leadership to help seek justice in the situation... I feel that is an important step in making things right. <p><HR NOSHADE>

Some firewall's are setup to hide or even stealth IP.   As some routers are to setup to hide or stealth routing IP address's.  Example  goverment, federal and police WAN's are setup that way.  Somebody could be playing at work.<br>

Not that it helps with the real issue - which is Guild Items not being returned.<br>
<br>
I was doing Spirocs the same time that Peppe was.  I being a necro and doing maybe 2 at a time - juggling them in dark and fear ... was alwaysed amazed with the talent off Peppe kiting like 6-7 birds at a time.  I even helped peel stuff when he would give me a tell saying he pulled 1 to many.<br>
<br>
In this time of convos that we shared - he did inform me that &quot;i am going away to college and a friend is taking over my account while I am gone ...&quot;<br>
<br>
A week later - I see Peppe kiting - and i give him a tell - and he tells me - that he is not the real Peppe - but a friend that has taken over his account.<br>
<br>
Well ... not that my information helps at all - cause what if that friend Ebayed - or whatever ... it is hard to tell what happened after the fact - all I know about is the initial transaction.<br>
<br>
A couple things though ...<br>
<br>
A)  I liked the original Peppe - but the one that has posted on this board - is childish to say the least - but heck - I bet you don't care - and you will probably flame me too - cause it is just a game - and not an investment to you.  The new Peppe - your flames on this board hearby incriminate you in my mind as a mean person and I will have nothing to do with you.<br>
<br>
B)  Xendrex - man ... all the bitterness.  Dude ... count yourself out on any raid that I lead or am on if I have the power to bring your attitude up with my friends.<br>
<br>
C)  For those of you thinking I am sticking my nose up SA's butt - you are wrong.  I have nothing to gain - and am not seeking entrance into SA.  I have met SA peeps that are talkative and ones that are focused.  IMHO - a great guild that focuses on what needs to be done - but peeps take it as meaness cause they don't get what &quot;they&quot; need from SA.<br>
<br>
Good luck on getting your stuff back SA - you'll be able to do it ... but sorry for your lost time ...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umikkylanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MikkyLanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#000033>(9/11/00 1:04:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sllim (Wood Elf Rogue, Riders of the Apoc)...</span><hr size=1> Ya know.. This is really getting outta hand... Some ppl have stated &quot;How do we know when characters are Ebayed?&quot;  Well that is very simple... WE ALL KNOW HOW TO READ THE EBAY SITE...  Not that hard to do.. When you see the Name and class of a character you pretty much know who they are &lt;DOH&gt;<br>
<br>
 Get a grip ppl... There are ppl that Ebay all the time... Alot of the time the one that end up with the character turns out to be an ass.. Just deal with it.. Nothing anyone can do but go on with your lives or stop playing EQ altogether.. Your choice..<br>
<br>
Now Alnaron you're just a brat kid that still needs to have Mommy wipe your nose for ya... You need to start acting like a young adult or you're never gonna make it... Cursing at everyone and shouting at them only proves how much a child you actually are... Trust me I hav kids at act better than you do...<br>
<br>
Now I think that since all the ppl that have been &quot;screwed&quot; by Slim should just let it go... Everyone is now aware of what happened and I for one wouldnt trust him as far as I could pick up an ogre and thow them &lt;fyi.. halfling druid&gt;...  Just accept the fact that you arent gonna get the items back and let it go...  I dont give or loan anything to anyone unless they are good friends or I dont really want or need the item to begin with... Saves alot of headaches in the long run..<br>
<br>
Ok I have stated my opinion I am done.. Take it with a grain of salt.. Thats about all any opinion is really worth anyway...<br>
<br>
Have A Nice Day.... ^-^  Just remember this is just a game.. Not like you actually pulled money outta your pocket and paid for the items...

Shitlisting Sllim is one way of dealing with it.<br>
<br>
It sounds like you'd rather us simply not post about this matter. After all, our tough luck, eh? With that attitude, the Shitlist might as well be deleted. Who cares about players screwing other players!<br>
<br>
The point of this post was not so much to get the items back, but to let everyone know about specifically who took them, and that they're the kind of person who would. Wouldn't you like to be warned of someone like this before you get screwed over by them? If you simply don't care, don't read the board. People who do want to be cautious, and people who can contribute to this thread will make it worth it's space on the board. <p><HR NOSHADE>

You ninja loot like an asshole, youre rude, all you care about is items, and I'm suprised you have any allies what-so-ever. Im only pissed at him because I went to duel his twinked out ass and he had some little bitch healing him, lvl 50 buffs, and he was laughing about it the whole time(Take in account that this was a long time ago and the no outside healing during a duel changes werent implemented yet).<br>

 If you werent being so emotional you would have understood what I said... I said that everyone now know's what happened and by Whom... Now all you can do is deal with it... I do care I have been screwed over by other characters and No I dont like it.... But what's the point in harping on it?  All that does is make you look Petty and Childish.. Geeze get a grip... It was a big deal to begin with I grant you that but there isnt anything you can do about it now... The only way you're going to get those items back is to go camp them again...

An aside on the stealing/taking items (virtual though they may be) of another player.<br>
<br>
People, real people, put time into their characters. Building them to accomplish goals and to DO more of some thing. Their equipment also takes time to gain, real time. Time we pay for by the month, year whatever. When another person takes this virtual equipment from you then you will realise how much time and actual labour was also taken.<br>
<br>
Heh, and it's not even of time alone but the time of other people, friends and allies, who helped obtain these virtual items. That's why active members of a guild will be pissed when one of their number Ebays. It's someone gaining a profit at the expense of other people, hardly accidently. I'd say quite a concious action.<br>
<br>
This is [what I am seeing as] the sensitive topic behind &quot;who took what from whom.&quot; Questions of trust, honesty and other forms of conduct healthy for a community are also at stake.<br>
