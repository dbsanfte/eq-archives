Who gives a fuck about who ignored whom about what?  Nothing could give this belligerent nut-job cretin an excuse for acting the way he is.  <br>
<br>
He's crying on the boards about getting the boot...but, for some bizarre reason, his cries all come out tangled up in filth and hate, making it pretty obvious to outsiders that telling him to hit the road was...well...probably a pretty good idea.<br>
<br>
This guy obviously has a lot to learn about some really basic things.  Like you're not going to get respect or sympathy when you roll around in your own piss and then complain that people don't like the way you smell.  And if you trash talk every woman you meet, you're eventually going to have to head for the sheep.  And that an asshole is an asshole...drunk or sober.  And that, come to think of it, sneaking a Natural Light out of Dad's fridge doesn't really qualify you as a drunk in the first place.<br>
<br>
There's a lot of talk about ignoring going on in the thread, but here we are at 5 pages.  If this guy has the hair on his sack to run his mouth like this in the outside world, someone will teach him a two-fisted lesson in shutting the fuck up pretty soon.  Take comfort in that knowledge and, for God's sake, stop posting to this thread.  Maybe he'll go away like he said he would in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugremer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gremer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 346<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/26/01 5:58:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silac, You just had to open your F-Mouth again.</span><hr size=1> &quot;I also don’t think it’s very cool to act like a little kid and ignore someone in your own guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's what I was responding to Ven (though I didn't consider it &quot;snapping&quot; /shrug).<br>
<br>
Taken as a general statement out of context, there is certainly some truth in that, because I can see the unwritten but implied qualifier &quot;...without first trying to work things out like mature adults.&quot;<br>
<br>
However, you wrote that as a response to this thread, thus converting it to a not-so-thinly veiled criticism of Fritti for putting Zolmaz on ignore (which as we both found out later never actually happened), and in your statement there lies the inherent presumption on your part that Fritti *didn't* try to work things out first, because if you didn't make that assumption, your statement is meaningless.  Why would you assume that?  Why would you not give Fritti the benefit of the doubt that she did everything in her power to resolve any conflicts with Zolmaz before committing to the final resort?  My response to your statement had nothing to do with my friendship with Fritti....it had everything to do with baseless assumptions.  You may deny that you made that assumption, but to me it was clear that that was your perception.<br>
<br>
Yea, I am a card carrying Fritti fan (nice link btw, I added it to my favorites, thanks!), but that's irrelevant.  Like you, I believe that any conflicts between guild members *should* be addressed and resolved if at all possible, and that ignore is only a final (and admittedly bad) solution to the problem.  We're at least in agreement there.<br>
<br>
Unlike you, when I read that somebody has someone else on ignore, I don't assume that the &quot;ignorer&quot; is acting like a little kid (though they may very well be).  I also wonder *why* they have that person on ignore and what events have led up to them taking that action.  Always two sides to every story, after all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udinuvenstratocaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dinuven Stratocaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/26/01 6:24:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silac, You just had to open your F-Mouth again.</span><hr size=1> Only one thing you said is true Gallux, is that Silac has a bad temper, but everyone knows that :P <br>

<br>
<I>First off you little Pussy boy, I wasn't pissed off untill<br>

FRITTI has me on her ignore list</u><I>. Then you went and<br>

and or asking why. And I did not insult her. </I><u>I only said<br>
she had me on her ignore list</u><I>, <br>
And would not port me to our guild functions any longer. <br>
Then you THOUGHT you had to protect her name. HAH.</I><br>
<br>
This is what I had to go on, before Chuk set the record straight. Then again, does Chuk really know if she had him on ignore or not, I think only one person knows that for sure and she hasn’t posted.<br>
<br>
<font color=fff00> and in your statement there lies the inherent presumption on your part that Fritti *didn't* try to work things out first, because if you didn't make that assumption, your statement is meaningless.

My response to your statement had nothing to do with my friendship with Fritti....it had everything to do with baseless assumptions. </font><br>
<br>
I have no idea what your relation to Fritti is, if any. Whether she is your wife, sister, Uncle Joe or Mailman and therefore you have some intimate knowledge of the goings on between her and Zolmaz, I know none of what you may be taking for granted. If we’re on same level of ignorance however, then don’t hate me for raising a big red flag at your flawed logic, but… how can you assume she did? <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

He obviously got to know her pretty well and Gremer's one to always give his friends the benefit of the doubt.  If it were one of your best ingame friends, wouldn't you assume the same thing?<br>
<br>
I'm not gonna pretend I know what went on between Fritti and Zolmaz at all, but in the time I was guilded with Fritti, she didn't come across to me to be the type of person to put someone on ignore for no reason (if, in fact, she did put him on ignore) and not without trying to resolve whatever conflict they had by other means first.<br>
<br>
It's easy to say that you should never put a guildmember on ignore, but how can you predict what's gonna happen.  If Fritti were treated ingame how she's been treated on the boards, I wouldn't blame her one bit if she did it. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Carathos&charactername=Carathos>Carathos Ollathir<BR><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove> 60th Druid<BR> <a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/>~Affliction~</a>

<br>
That was posted in response to Kerryn, Ven.  He stuck up (sorta) for Zolmaz, and I was pointing out that IMO Zolmaz's behavior on this thread is perfectly good reason to be upset with him and that I don't care if it's because he's angry.  I don't know anything for sure about Magister's internal business, so I can't comment accurately on what actually happened between Fritti and Zolmaz.<br>
<br>
I agree with you that putting a guildmate on /ignore is a pretty bad idea, but keep in mind that the only reason we have to believe that Fritti had Zolmaz on /ignore is that Zolmaz said so.  Just because Zolmaz says something doesn't make it so, as Silac's screenshot indicates.<br>

My guild had already killed Lord Yelinak before. I just happened to log on at the time they were making a shot at Lord Yelinak and acted EXACTLY the same way Magister acted when we asked them to leave our King Tormax raid.<br>
<br>
I guild removed because I wanted to prove a point. Koryo told me I would be in big trouble if I stayed there (he was going to talk to Trillium at the time). So I guild removed. No one to complain to then and since I want violating any rules I have every right to be there.<br>
<br>
Unlike Zolmaz (when I asked him to leave the King Tormax raid refused), I did the right thing and left. I still had to put up with one very outspoken Magister member making a dick out of himself (as usual).<br>

I dug up the old thread that was removed because im sick of seeing the Magister / Da`Kor favouritism that exists on this message board. I did not repost it because of the content and if I had actually know that the druid mentioned was Fritti I would not have done so. I have no intention of hurting a friend.<br>
<br>
If the moderators want to show ANY consistency they MUST delete this thread since they deleted the previous one which is about the exact same issues.<br>

<br>
I think it's very easy to say this, and even easier to practice.  <br>
<br>
Why?  Well, primarily there are two reasons I see folks joining guilds.  Friends or wanting to accomplish something that you need an organized group to do.<br>
<br>
In both cases, putting a guild member on ignore negates the purpose of the guild.  <br>
<br>
If you are joining to accomplish the bigger things in game, you need communication.  Putting someone on ignore prevents communication.  If you have a legitimate issue that would make you consider using the ignore feature, it would seem as though you would want to address it through guild policy, not take matters into your own hands and put someone on ignore.  <br>
<br>
I'm not standing up for Zolmaz nor assuming that Fritti did indeed have him on ignore.  It's not my guild, therefore, it's not my problem.  <br>
<br>
I am merely making the point that putting a guild member on ignore is not how I believe guild members should act, no matter the provocation.  If you have a gripe, you bring it up, see it solved to your satisfaction and if it's a big enough issue and you don't like the result, you move to a guild that makes you happier.  <br>

I didn't assume anything.  Assumptions get you in trouble.  Maybe she tried to work it out and couldn't.  Maybe she didn't.  I don't know....and neither do you.  That's my point, which you still seem to miss.  You assumed that she didn't, and that made her, in your mind, immature for putting a guildie on ignore.  That accusation was inappropriate for the simple reason that you were, by your own admission, lacking the knowledge of what actually transpired.<br>
<br>
I only know Fritti as a former guildmate and an ingame friend, and other than a few brief conversations, I only know Zolmaz from what he has posted here and in a few other threads.  Based on that (admittedly limited) input, I have no doubts regarding my choice of sides in this conflict.  Frankly, looking at the irrational hate-filled gibberish that forms the bulk of Zolmaz's writings, I'm surprised that anyone is sympathetic to him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utaannddrriidd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taannddrriidd</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 12:26:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silac, You just had to open your F-Mouth again.</span><hr size=1> i agree.<br>
