He made himself quite the bad rep in Ot. This guy would LEAP at a kill to loot, so much so that there would be actual pauses in his pulling because he was too busy looting every corpse he could. This was witnessed by my alt ofcourse hehe =) I recall him asking a wizard to pull once because he was too busy doing homework and had better things to do lol.

As for Dandate, he is on my friends list (Which I check about.. every 5 minutes..) and I have seen him on occassionaly, though when I tried to speak with him (Per Brutil's request) he has either logged or told me some BS about his computer being broken. If I see him on again, Ellysor you'll be the first to know.<br>

My apologies to all else this has happened to, if you do need help with money or items I would be more than willing to offer my meager assistance.<br>

I know how it feels to have your things taken, but what can be done?  This is a serious problem and needs to be solved by a Gm or a higher authority.  I think a person like that destroys the game, simply because there is no way of getting the stuff back.  Gms have never done it for me and it sux.  I will do all I can to see to it that action is taken.  It is better to lose one than to have an ass of people pissed and complaining Imo.  Just wanna say I'm with ya Bro., but we aren't all like that, the best advice I can give is to play it smart. No one can be held accountable for his actions but him, and it wont be over till he has no account to keep making new characters.  Maybe I'm harsh but it's true, no one can control a person. Sorry again. Goodluck in the future. I'm out.<br>

<br>
I am in Maxim's guild and I can confirm that he spoke of the deal at length that night while and after it happened.<br>
<br>
I have also spoke to Skitter (I belive that is the proper name), an officer of Empire that was in LOIO shouting for recruits (/sigh) and he assured me that he would also do anything he could to help resolve the issue.<br>
<br>
As for GM's... well as good of a reputation that Frizz has for helping people on Lanys, I doubt there is much he can do.  I would strongly suggest that the people that have been scammed by this fellow form a &quot;class-action&quot; type complaint about him.  Individuals get screwed all the time, but if you can show to the GMs/VI that his person makes a hobby out of it, they would be nuts to let him continue this time of activity.<br>
<br>
Lastly... spread the word.  Do not engage in third party trades.  ;-(<br>

I logged on about 2 days ago and said to Utildar that skitter is being so nice to do that for us and utiladr said hes not going to let him do that i and argued with him stupidly.  Later that night when skitter logged on he had already removed himself from his guild saying he was quiting.  I said to him please dont quit, I dont care about the money anymore I just dont wan't to ruin a players EQ life.  He said he is sic of the bad eople in the game and is going to quit and it has nothing to do with me and I said please dont quit.  I asked his guild and said what was wrong and they said he was just angry at some members in the guild.  Skitter gave me 2.5k and sat there, i tried giving it back and he kept canceling. Then Skitters guild friends started talking to him that he should keep playing, he finally gave in and re joined the guild and was all happy, i then tried once again to give him the 2.5k and he said &quot;Keep it you deserve it&quot;.

I am ashamed of your actions. I think you need to realize that you are one of at least 5 if not more who are in the same situation. Never, and I do mean Never would I pressure someone into doing what Skitter did. The thought would never even cross my mind. I could be running around in banded w/ a FS sword and I wouldnt put someone out like that. This situation has NOTHING to do w/ him and he bears absolutely no responsibility. My problem lies only w/ the perpetrator in this instance. I have spoken to many members of is guild and they are truley ashamed of his actions and want him gone. For me that is enough to ask of them.<br>
 That 2500pp is blood money drawn from the wrong veins. We are all out in this situation. And if you remember, I told you I would quest some Crafted for you and help you get yourself back on your feet. If you want to remove yourself from the circle of people actively working towards a resolution w/ the GM's, and do things on your own. Then do so. If not, Give the pp to his guild and wash your hands of this, and change your attitude.<br>
Brutils actions only represent his best interest and not all of ours. Skitter please give me a /tell in game.<br>

I may have been a little hash in my previous post. but, I am still serious. I do not believe taking <u>one</u> persons items will help my/our situation any. And I do applaud your returning his pp/items. I apologize for coming off so strongly. Please give me a /tell in game!<br>
<br>
--Skitter,<br>
Thanks for the /tell tonite in game. I do really appreciate the gesture you have made to help clear the name of your guild. And to uphold the Honor of both yourself, and your guild. IMO the gesture alone is proof enough that you mean well. And I would never act on it. My/our problem only lies with a dishonorable player who happened to call your guild home. Not the guild itself.<br>
 We can start this thread into the old "Who is resposible" thread. and spar off about whether it is the guild or the individuals. But I do hope that I am absolutely clear on this issue. <br>
 To all in Fall of the Empire, I thank you for the support and the many /tells i have recieved in game regarding this person and his actions. I, however do not intend to collect a dime from any of you. Just Dandate, he is the one w/ the target on his back.<br>
