<br>
Brutus, you make a lot of assumptions about me and &quot;my&quot; type of evangelism, and why I do it.  <br>
<br>
If you want to know my motivation, simply ask.  <br>
<br>
In general, here is some ramblings.  I kinda addressed this to Brutus, but it can be made general.  I am NOT attacking anyone here.  This is being written from the heart, not through intellectual channels so forgive me if I make mistakes in the wording.  Please try to see the message, not the mistakes.<br>
<br>
I am motivated by love for God, my fellow man, and for the eternal consequneces of one's decision.  I cannot be more clear than that.  I have stated the eternal consequence to convey the gravity of the situation, not to condem.  my job is not to condem, it is to spread the gospel.  While others find spiritual matters something to not discuss, I find it something that is vital to discuss with those in my life.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean I run around preaching the word of God all day, far from it.  If you think that and actually knew me, you would laugh very hard.  However, if the opportunity arises and the parties are receptive, then I do give the gospel.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are all fallen, Brutus.  That means that none of us, not a single person - is perfect, and that includes me, and it means that I have the same feelings and drives and desires and lusts as those I live with in this fallen world.  It is my nature, as it is yours.  So yes, we are all hypocrites, and liars, and thieves, and we all pursue our immoral ways, which all lead to spiritual death.  There is not one of us without sin, not one on this entire earth.  So aye, I am all those things you said and more, Brutus.  For I am human.  And, as you state you do, I strive to be more like Christ everyday, inevitably falling short, yet studying and learning to love more and more each day with the help of God.  For example, learning that love isn't a feeling, its a way of life.<br>
<br>
God would not allow me, one single person on earth, to keep Lurikeen from reconciling himself with the Lord, if that was Lurikeen's decision.  So, if my way of evangelizing caused Lurikeen to be provoked, I at least hope that it also caused him to open his mind to the possibility that I might be right, even if he doesn't like me, what I have to say, or the way I say it.  I did not intend to cause problems to him or any other, but I trust that the Lord will do His will whether I open my big mouth or not.<br>
<br>
I think, in general, that my passionate replies, especially those defending God, my character, my fatih, my belief, and my morals, were more than likely - taken in a context that I did not intend.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope that this was a clear post.  It is late and I am trying to say much without too long of a post.<br>
<br>
<br>
To answer the burning question, yes I am female, and I have stated that many many times.  I am surprised that it wasn't obvious.<br>
<br>
Good night.  I will check back, but prob not for a week or more, just not enough time in the day atm.<br>
<br>
Keep the faith. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/28/02 8:57:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=302.topic&index=144>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Simple, Clear and Poweful</span><hr size=1> Lukaria:<br>

Very well spoken <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My wife often tell me, in a loving way, &quot;your a 'know-it-all'!&quot; and it doesn't really surprise me. Most people who have strong convictions tend to have a hard time seeing gray. Some may think its a sign of weakness to &quot;consider&quot; or stand in the middle of the road. Some may honestly feel there is no in-between.<br>
<br>
Religion does that to us. Those with a deeply rooted spiritual belief tend to direct all things up or down... its either good or its evil...right or wrong..no gray, only black and white.<br>
<br>
The logical (or carnal) mind ponders all and considers all. This seems like a awesome approach when trying to get an extra 10MPG out of an automobile...or exploring space for other life forms. But this approach doesn't work will with religion and never has cause plan and simple...God cannot be seen in a physical sense. The entire concept of faith, believing what cannot be physically proven, contrasts and contradicts the logical mind to its core.<br>
<br>
As a young lad growing up, I would often feel guilty if I for one moment doubted God's existence. I felt obligated to believe in Him no matter what I thought.... It was a emotional 'catch-22'. Fearing that if I didn't confess a belief in Him, regardless of what I felt, I would burn...then one day something happened...<br>
<br>
I was out fishing by myself at about age 18 or so...there was no one around.. Just me, my pole and tackle and the water. A man came up behind me from nowhere and said &quot;hi!  catching anything?&quot;  I went on to tell him that I hadn't caught a dang thing and was about to head home.  He then asked me if I knew...not believed in, but knew God. I feeling obligated to remain faithful to God said &quot;yes..yes I do&quot; while in the back of my mind thinking &quot;oh great..he is going to preach to me about God&quot;....but he didnt..he only said a few words. He said .. &quot;you know... many people think that the saying &quot;fear the Lord&quot; means to fear His wrath. It doesn't mean that at all.. it means to look upon God and marvel at His greatness. Its ok to seek God in your heart cause that's what He meant for us to do&quot;... With that he left saying &quot;good luck with your fishing&quot; and was gone.<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with seeking God. There is nothing wrong with questioning God at times...we need to seek His face and His will in all things. One will prolly never find Him with logic alone... one has to take that leap of faith in their mind and heart.<br>
<br>
NEway, that's it for now...busy at work.<br>

But here is a good example of what I meant by be careful how you state things. “I at least hope that it also caused him to open his mind to the possibility that [I might be right]”   While the board does include how we think and feel about certain things, if it is your goal to SHARE rather than to simply CONVERT, you should probably not make a claim of some sort with an alterior motive that includes (what might seem like) sheer manipulation, condensation or plain bragging to know the most mysterious questions in life.  That question of ‘why’ is many times the foundation for not only our beliefs but for our pain as well.   Rheaton is being way more diplomatic about this than I am (BTW Awesome story Rheaton)  <br>
<br>
I think its great that you are venturing into the spiritual world as you are.  So please don’t get me wrong here.  My goal is to provide a mirror image of the result of your claims, and more clearly, the result of the process by which you state your claims.  It can be a very ugly picture depending on who you are communicating with.  Yes, I know truth is not always a pretty picture, but there is love as well.  Love and truth are meant to balance each other and create a certain picture reality etc…..   With a goal of evangelizing and/or expressing your passion of God, you might take into account the impact of the weight of truth or love you might have.  Then again, God has a way of balancing things out.  <br>
<br>
Lurikeen believes in many of the laws of love and truth you, I and many people believe in.  Its more of a communication thing.  He is very articulate and you quite frankly, are not.  I am not articulate either.  I just made a little more effort in understanding to whom I was speaking.  Everything matters and nothing matters.   Everything is relative, even the idea that nothing is relative.  So don’t worry about it.  Conflict is a natural and at times motivating experience.    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   you guys sure do fight like cats and dogs though.  I tried my best to mediate both points of view.  Not sure if I was successful but I tried.  <br>
<br>
Once again Rheaton, awesome story, you could expand that and write a little book.  Very cool experience.  That fear of God thing pissed me off many times while growing up.  Not sure if I mentioned this, but I grew up in South Florida and moved to the good ole Bible belt around the age of  9.  I noticed the ‘fear of God’,  ‘your goin to hell’, ‘beg for forgiveness’ talk as soon as I arrived.  Those tend to be grossly overstated by certain sects of religion and certain regions of the nation AKA the Bible belt.  Err, this post is getting long.  Cya and thnx for sharing the story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
