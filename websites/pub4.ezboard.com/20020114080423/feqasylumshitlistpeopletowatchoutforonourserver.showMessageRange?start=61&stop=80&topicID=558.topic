<br>
"its always dickheads like this that DEMAND justice, and civil behavior when they are infact the ones who never give it"<br>
<br>
Growing up what did the bully do when someone finally kicked the crap out of him? He ran to the teacher. <br>
<br>
What does a murderer do when caught by the police? Calls for his attorney and his due process of law. <br>
<br>
This person acted totally uncivil, even admitting that he was wrong, and that he felt sorry for the individual that he fucked over, but would do nothing less than perpetuate what he did by not giving the WS back to him. <br>
<br>
There is one reason and one reason only that this person is giving back the WS now. <br>
<br>
He is giving it back because he is  on the SL and is a coward so he wants to try to make things right only because it took social sanctioning, not out of his own kindness. <br>
<br>
Hey Lum, your and asshole...but even worse than that, your a cowardly asshole. <br>
<br>
To the person who got their stuff jacked, I wouldnt take the WS back from him, enough people have said they would help you get one. There is no reason to accept kindness from this guy. If you do it would make him feel like he rectified the situation, and he doesnt deserve that.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uigottomuchgameforyou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>igottomuchgameforyou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/5/01 8:08:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

If you don't take it back then he not only got the pleasure of getting the attention he also gets to keep the wep he stole.  And that is telling this guy that he can do it again and get away with it again with not having to give the wep back because he didn't have too the first time.  I also doubt that brash or whatever his name is would want to take time out of his friends gaming time to help him get the item back.  Take the wep back if he seriously is going to give it back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=luminescence>Luminescence</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/5/01 8:14:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luminescence.

Troll Thief and Liar.</span><hr size=1> False repentence...how typical....hehe.<br>
<br>
However, I seriouly doubt that an apology would do much good anyway, so save it.  It amazes me how much disregard CERTAIN people have for the rights and feelings of others. As someone posted earlier...these are usually the same people who demand their own civil rights when they hammer falls.  I see so many posts saying &quot;Its only a game...get over it&quot;.  Most people don't realize that there is an emotional connection attached to a game like this and when someone is stolen from or lied to or whatever, it has a certain real emotional effect.  I know I am wasting my time pointing this out to Loserescence, but I think it is something that we all could learn from.  I was as angry as anyone over this thing because Brash is a guildmate of mine and a first class person.  However, when the anger subsided, I found that what I felt toward Luminescammer was not hatred....it was pity.  <br>
<br>
Now follow me here...this person has said for sometime how they don't care about the game and yada, yada, yada.  Yet, they have gone to such great lengths to obviously beg for equipment and to scam a decent weapon.  Now why would someone do that if they didn't care about the game?  Clearly he thought, just like many others have, that there was nothing that could be done to him and that he would not catch any crap because....well...what he did was not against &quot;THE RULES&quot;.  Well...as we have seen here...66 posts in less than 48 hours...the Lanys Community takes care of its own and sweeps the riff-raff away like so much clutter and THAT is why I feel pity for him.  He is persona non grata and that is a sad place to be.  <br>
<br>
My thanks to all those who have supported Brash in this situation.  Those that have painted him as an upstanding person hit the nail right on the head and I felt compelled to post here in his support as an officer of the Chosen Counsel.  <br>
<br>
To Lumi...Im sorry for you...but the hole you dug here is deep.  Bring me back some Chow Mein, would you? <br>

What your saying is, I'm screwed beyond all redemption.  I do one little thing, and you're going to pity/flame/ignore/hate/insult/deprive me forever?  All I try to do is help people out, and for one little thing that got blown totally out of preportion, you're gonna burn me.  However, you're not just going to burn me, you're going to tell all of your friends, aquaintences, groups, guilds, etc to burn me too, since you know I'm such an asshole.  Where's the love?  <br>
