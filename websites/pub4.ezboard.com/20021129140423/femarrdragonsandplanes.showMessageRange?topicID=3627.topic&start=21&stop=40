<br>
What i dont understand is what do you think is PoP going to change for you that EQ hasnt already? This is EQ, a game about grouping together and killing them bad monsters. Reaching new levels. upgrading your gear and basically  telling war stories about  stuff that you experianced along the way.<br>
<br>
Why would PoP change your mind about quitting?Are you waiting around to see if the designs are better? from the SS in the PoP page on eqlive i can tell they already blow luclin away. You're concerned about the storyline? From reading some of the lore on the PoP page this expansion is all about traveling to the legendary planes and encountering the vaious deities throughout EQ's history. <br>
<br>
You're concerned about the tedium involved in leveling?  you just came to this revelation now? after 3.5 years you just now realised leveling is boring? of course  leveling is boring, of course its tedious. but of course thats whats been around from the games release.  <br>
<br>
Its a means to an end, do you want to raid the mean monsters with your friends? Well you need to prepare yourself for those encounters,  via levels, gear and strategy. You can still hang with friends, an expansion wont change the frinds you currently have.<br>
<br>
Sorry if im being stubborn, i just cant conceive why PoP is the deciding factor on your eq future. <br>

EQ is an insane time sink, whether you're leveling or tradeskilling or raiding. It's not generally type of activity that you can just do for a few minutes here and there. If you're going to sit down and play, it's going to take some time.<br>
<br>
If you aren't enjoying that time anymore, why waste it? Why not spend it doing something that you do enjoy?<br>
<br>
Sure, Planes of Power will have some new things. People that enjoy the current game will likely enjoy that too. People who are continuing to sink their time into an activity that they don't enjoy will likely be disappointed when PoP comes out becasue it will still be the same game. <br>
<br>
People who are planning to quit when the expansion is released- why keep playing now? Why wait til then?<br>
<br>
Someday we will all stop playing this game. When you walk away, it means nothing that you have maxed aa points, are a gm tradeskiller, or have nice gear. You don't take anything with you but memories. If the memories you are currently making are ones of boredom and/or resent, do yourself a favor and find else to spend your time doing.<br>

Ok, round 3!<br>
<br>
Let's try this again. This time, I'm going to break it down nice and easy, step by step, with very few big words, even though I'm going to be repeating myself. Again.<br>
<br>
Maybe Big Boy read better with Big Font.<br>
<br>
PoP is not the deciding factor.  I've long since been away from the game and only log on an hour at a time to chat to friends.  I don't know how y'all came up with the conclusion that we're still putting up with EQ even though it irritates us- oh wait, I'm a smart girl, of course I know!  You as<i></i>s-umed!  <br>
<br>
*pats self on the back*  You are so smart, you devilish little munchkin, you.<br>
<br>
That's exactly the same misunderstanding Razer jumped to.  Oh, y'all are quitting because of PoP? That's stupid!<br>
<br>
This is dejavu because I already covered the ground you're treading on right now... like in my last post.<br>
<br>
Where the hell did I say I was quitting because of PoP?  Or because PoP was the deciding factor?  <br>
<br>
Person 1: You're quitting because of PoP, that's stupid!<br>
Me: I've quit because I don't like EQ.<br>
Person 2: Why quit because of PoP?<br>
Me: Because I don't like EQ.<br>
Person 3: You just realized you don't like leveling?<br>
Me: I've already quit because I don't like EQ.<br>
Person 4: Why wait until PoP comes out to quit EQ?<br>
Me: I've already quit because I don't like EQ.<br>
Person 5: You don't have to have PoP to keep playing EQ.<br>
Me: I've already quit because I don't like EQ.<br>
Person 6:  Why stick around and keep playing if you don't like PoP or EQ?<br>
Me: I have already fvcking quit because I don't like EQ.<br>
<br>
Why comment on PoP then?  Go look at the other thread and the person who mentions increased levels asked for thoughts on the matter.  That's why.  Then someone as<i></i>s-u-mes that I must not like the expansion because of levels (which is something I never said but y'all think I said).  Then the assumptions go further.  Suddenly I'm quitting because of PoP!  Suddenly I only just realized I don't like levels!  Suddenly PoP was the deciding factor to me quitting!  Suddenly it's somebody's business to find out why I would want to quit!  Suddenly, it's all about PoP because one person read too far into (or didn't read into at all) what was originally said.  <br>
<br>
</font><br>
<font size=+3><br>
Summary:  Hate EQ.  Already retired.  Account alive because I payed for 6 months before retiring.  Pretty sure PoP offers nothing to bait me to come back to EQ.  Expressed opinion that I don't like PoP, though failed to include "because EQ blows atm for me."  Got jumped for daring to not like PoP.  Someone ass-umes I'm superficial enough to quit something I invested 3 years into because I don't like levels.  Previously never stated I had an aversion to leveling.  Now argument escalates to include PoP and me quitting purely because of levels.  Argument carried on now because more a<i></i>ss-umations are made that I'm still an active player who recently realized she hates levels.  Far from truth.  Too much as<i></i>s-u-ming.<br>
</font><br>
Lesson learned:  Not everybody's self worth is invested in EQ and people do *gasp* get bored of it and *gasp* quit.  That's one less worshipper for those who measure their worth by EQ, I know, but c'est la vie~ <p>- Aishen<br>

<br>
Neither in Chuk's post, nor in my post did anyone speak about you. Both posts were general statements on the decision to play the game until PoP comes out. <br>
<br>
Since you have already quit the game, and had stated that fact prior, it is ridiculous for you to imagine that anyone who is wondering why people who are planning to stop playing the game when PoP comes out were talking about you.<br>
<br>
Let me re-cap, just so there are no mistakes here.<br>
<br>
1) It has been made clear in previous posts (in a regular size font) that Aishen is retired.<br>
<br>
2) We are having a discussion on the merits of playing a game that people don't enjoy pending a release of additional content in said game<br>
<br>
3) Nobody asked people who are not playing the game why they are playing the game. People who are still playing the game were the subjects of the posts<br>
<br>
4) This topic is not about people who are retired<br>
<br>
5) This topic is not about you, Aishen<br>
<br>
All clear or does this need to be bigger too?<br>

<br>
This is not the "aishen must have attention" thread, this is a discussion about people who have a problem with more levels in EQ.<br>
Im rather delighted people are quitting in droves becuase they cant stand PoP having more levels. <br>
<br>
I just dont understand why. Is it becuase you wish to see the PoP end content that only the few hardcore fuckers with time and experiance on their side will see? Well thats understandable  but as was posted by Absor and was already stated in this thread there will be content for all ranges of levels. Plus you have the highest end content from the previous expansion which you never got a chance to see. Thats a hell of a lot to do.<br>
<br>
If anything the very high end of eq is getting the shaft becuase  there most likely will only be 3 or 4  zones dedicated to us while the other 16 zones will be for everyone else. <br>
<br>
Do you really think only the *good* designers worked on those 4 dungeons while they let any schlub work on the other 16 planes? Id really be interested in feedback on why getting just 5 non hell levels in PoP wil be worse than exping 30+ AA points in luclin. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742"target="_blank">

<br>
VI gives the casual gamer normal zones, tons of them. Compare them to how many uber zones right now and you'll see that EC + every other normal zone where the casual player can play, outnumber uber zones 10 to 1. Or even more.<br>
<br>
When I was younger I vowed that I wanted to visit every plane that was released. And I will never see PoM unless I play about 10 times more often. Or find some uber guild willing to, on my time, corpse me over to PoM or however they do it. If they still do it.<br>
<br>
And NToV, Vex thal, those are awesome places I'll never get to see! The most uber place I ever got to go to in Luclin was Ssra, or with Velious, the very entrance of NToV. <br>
<br>
You say, cry me a @#%$ river. You play the game hardcore enough to have made 60 two years ago? I've been playing since 1999 and I have yet to level to 60.. So you think I'm looking forward to more levels? I'm not! I'm like the runner of a marathon, almost out of energy but he sees the finish line, then when he gets near it it moves 100 yards back, but he struggles onward to reach it, right before it does it moves another 50 yards back, but it's uphill and the track has turned  into mud. I, the runner, am at the point saying, @#%$ it.<br>
<br>
VI knows that the true heart of EQ is the hardcore players, so they give them the best zones, challenging, yes. Very. But still, over all the best looking zones will be ones for the hardcore.<br>
<br>
And 30 bucks says that 50% of PoP is generated towards hardcore players.<br>

You play the game hardcore enough to have made 60 two years ago? I've been playing since 1999 and I have yet to level to 60.. So you think I'm looking forward to more levels? I'm not! I'm like the runner of a marathon, almost out of energy but he sees the finish line, then when he gets near it it moves 100 yards back, but he struggles onward to reach it, right before it does it moves another 50 yards back, but it's uphill and the track has turned into mud. I, the runner, am at the point saying, @#%$ it.***<br>
<br>
Why does the idea of 5 more levels threaten you? You do not need to level to 65, heck you dont need to level to 60. there is plenty to do at any level. You can enter any plane in Prekunark to present at 46+.  <br>
<br>
You use the anology of a winded runner at the end of a race. Why do you feel you are racing and what is your goal at the finish line? <br>
<br>
Will you quit? will you start another char and level all over again? if you want to quit, why wait til you ding level 60, quit now. If you want to start a twink go ahead and start one. Making a char level 60 then grinding it out all over again from level 1 is even more tedious then 5 levels in a new expansion.<br>
<br>
Sorry i just dont see your logic. Not flaming you or anything mind you.<br>

Then move on and be content that I beat the game. When kunark came out I said for a little bit that 50 was fine.. but the closer I got the more I kept telling myself in order to feel I've beaten the game I need to reach the maximum level, but it was hard, perilous, exp moved slow, and I tried to quit many times. <br>
<br>
Now I'm so close to what I consider my own personal 100% end of game.<br>
<br>
And they add more levels. Which according to them aren't going to be easy for a casual gamer to get in a few months time..<br>
<br>
If you group in CT every night for 10 hours a night, I can see you saying, no big deal, I'll be 65 in a month. But for me, those added levels would more than likely take another half year to complete. <br>
<br>
What else will they do to keep people playing? Take off the level cap? I can see where some level 200 guy is MA'ing emp in his one group of level 200 people,  whilst it takes 100, level 200 people to kill the latest &quot;uber&quot; mob. Or just 50 levl 200 people that have the best armor on the server. the warriors having 1500 ac and 20000 hp with 250 stats unbuffed. The game just keeps going on and on and they keep laying down track as it goes. I've run my course, it's time to get off the train. I'm not going to try to get level 65.. and as soon as the next town *game* comes up I'm getting off. <p><a href="http://www.twisted-tantrums.net/onemile/drug.html"><img border="0" src="http://www.twisted-tantrums.net/onemile/nothing.jpg"></a><br><font size="2"><a href="http://www.twisted-tantrums.net/onemile/drug.html">What kind of Drug Addict are you?</a> </center>

I don't recall once seeing in these posts that aishen already quit the game. if she quit already, why is she here thinking everyones talking to her? If she did quit the game already, why would she think &quot;you're gonna quit when PoP comes out?&quot; was aimed at her, since she's already gone.<br>
<br>
Sorry aishen, but you must think you're more popular and important than you actually are, because I know nothing about you and you can't ASS-ume that everyone knows you quit the game already.<br>

I ASS-ume that anyone here talking about everquest stuff might actually play the game, cause you know, what would be the point of it if you didn't. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138154"><img src="http://www.tbaytel.net/scaryf/images/everquest/razer.gif"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=razer>Razer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/14/02 5:08:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3627.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: did ya really quit?</span><hr size=1> I meant I never saw it mentioned till this page. she didn't say &quot;I'm with dwark, 5 more levels? no thanks.

As usual Chuk you are missing the point and fabricating lies. I contradicted myself how did I do that? I said EQ is the greatesr game ever but I am tired of it, if you think that is contradicting oneself please go to;<br>
