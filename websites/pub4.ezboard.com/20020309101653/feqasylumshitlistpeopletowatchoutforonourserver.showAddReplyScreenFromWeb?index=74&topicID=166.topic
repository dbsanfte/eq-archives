Since I've met Uzziell, he's shown nothing but kindness and respect to me. We've done a whole lot of shit together. Shit that would amaze a lot of people and he's a DAMNED GOOD wizard. When he got back on after his hiatus he asked me what I was up to and when I told him I was leading a guild and he showed interest, I had absolutely NO inhabitions about giving him a home with us. He's lead riads for my members with no possibility of getting anything for himself and I am damned proud of having him as a member here. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, if you actually sit down and have a chat with the guy (the real guy as he let somebody else play him for a while) you'll find that he's one of the most helpful people you'll ever meet, knows almost everything about every zone, and will go WELL out of his way to help anyone if they ask <br>
<br>
If there IS an infraction of any of Iris's play policies, rest assured it will be handled just like anyone else. Im not at all worried about that though because I am certain that he will treat all of the Lanys community with respect and dignity. If you have an encounter with Uzziell, and are unhappy with it, please...send me a tell in game and it will be dealt with. I'm sure he'll surprise you all. Thanks. <br>

The Uzziell that I had seen around that time didn't seem the same as the Uzziell that camped an entire floor of Dalnir while my Guild was there, threatened to call in a bunch of level 60's to ruin our fun, and &quot;promised&quot; us that he would see to it that we never stepped foot in any of the Planes.  So, like an idiot, I went to their Boards saying &quot;give the guy a chance to prove everyone wrong.&quot;  <br>
<br>
For a while, things went pretty well and his Guild members came to these Boards requesting that his 3 (yes... THREE) shitlistings be locked and deleted.  &quot;He is a changed man!&quot; they all said.  People like Istrahd tried to warn the members of Monarchy of the Dead about him, and ultimately, he was right.<br>
<br>
After an &quot;incident&quot;, the new-and-improved Uzziell was going to lead raid after raid after raid to show his Guild that they were wrong and he was right.  On the Raid Boards, there were raids to Dragon Necrop, PoG, PoH, Kael... you name it and he had raids planned.  People signed up, he was going to show the world that he was uber_raid_leader01!!  Then, without word, the raids were cancelled and he vanished from the server.<br>
<br>
Now, he's back with a vengence it appears.  He has been nothing but spectacular for Iris.  He's leading you to glory!!  OMG, he lead a raid where he didn't get anything!!  Do you not see the pattern here?  I don't know much about your Guild, Asteroth.  I know you left Riders to start your own Guild of friends amd family.  I see you post in another thread that you will NEVER overrun a raid where people are preparing to do battle.  If you truly want your Guild to be taken seriously, step one would be to remove one of the most despised individuals on the server from it.  <br>
<br>
Trust me when I say he is a cancer that will destroy your Guild.  Trust me also when I say I will do everything in my power to never allow anyone from IRIS on one of my Guild's raids as long as Uzziell is in that Guild.  I don't care if it is Hate, Fear, HoT, or Orc 6.  It is never right to judge a person by the tag that flies above their head, but when the leader of that Guild gives such a ringing endorsement about someone like Uzziell, I have to question the competence of anyone that follows that person.  Good luck with the new Guild and with Officer Uzziell.  Istrahd isn't here to say &quot;I told you so&quot; so I will do it when the time comes.  One last thing:<br>

And also, Uzziell has been away for MONTHS now. MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, he WAS an asshole at a lower level but people can change. Maybe he's willing to make a mends with the people he has wronged over time. When I invited him into the Iris family I was acting on personal experience and there is NO WAY IN HELL I will allow him to ruin the reputation of my guild. BAsically, I am giving him a fair shot becuase he has shown me nothing but support since I've known him. It saddens me that the actions of this one individual has affected the future of my entire guild by you not allowing us on your raids. There will never be a WHOLE GUILD that is not allowed on an Iris raid. There ARE certain single people that will not be able to attend an Iris raid, however there is no way in hell I am going to penalize that persons guild by not allowing them a chance to raid with me if the would like to. If there is some kind of personal vendeta here then thats fine but the decision has been made. Uzziell is a member of Iris and will continue to be one for as long as he is the honorable person that I know he is. Again, he HAS let somebody else play his character for the past FEW months as when he took his hiatus he told me what the deal was. Rind, if you as a guildleader want to hold Uzziell's membership here against us, thats fine with me. It's not worth arguing about. I personally think it's lame, but that's just me. Vita Infinita will ALWAYS be welcome to come and raid with Iris as well as ANY other guild that would like to have a few of their member that meet the appropriate level come with us. Sorry if I cant just say &quot;Sorry Uzz, see ya!&quot;  but thats MY decision. You've made yours. Good Day. <br>

As for me saying what I said about members of Iris, it is my personal decision.  If I am leading a raid, I will not allow anyone from Iris on one of my raids, it's that simple.  It's not like Vita hosts many open raids anyways, but that is where I stand.  Uzziell has caused enough trouble on this server, let enough people down, and yet people still seem willing to take him in and get hurt again.  He has hurt me, my old Guild, and countless people I like to call friends yet you still can't see it.  <br>
<br>
You say &quot;MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, he WAS an asshole at a lower level&quot; but he wasn't exactly a n00b when he was doing all of this.  Ask him how long he as been level 60.  By you saying MAYBE, you seem to not even believe that we are telling the truth about his past actions.  Do you not believe he really did all of those things mentioned?  Do you not believe he really hurt the people who posted on his behalf, only to be stabbed in the back?  <br>
<br>
He is already ruining your Guild's reputation just by being a part of it, and you don't even realize it.  You say he has let somebody else play him for the past few months but now he's back. The problems weren't with the Uzziell of the past few months, they were with the original... months ago.  Never mind, take who you want for your Guild.  One day you will learn that there is more to choosing members to REPRESENT you than being level 60 and having an Epic.  I'm sorry that I care for people the way I do.  Good luck with your new Guild. <p><p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3192" target="0"><img src="http://watchersrealm.virtualave.net/eq_sigs/eq_sig_n.jpg" border="0"><br>Profile</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uneeshathenecro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neesha the Necro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md96-jma/eq/us.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/4/02 10:17:47 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver>The Shit List </a> <font color=#000033> - </font><a href="http://www.lanys.com">Lanys.com</a><font color=#000033> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
