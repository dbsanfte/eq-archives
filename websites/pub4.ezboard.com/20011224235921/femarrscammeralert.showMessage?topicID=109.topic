-----------------------<br>
<br>
Today we have the sad duty to report that the character known in-game as Daglett (who identified himself as Denise and Kerryn/Kerrin), caught the Phoenix Crusaders at their most caring and betrayed many.<br>
<br>
Conclusive evidence came to light that disproved the story of Denise's supposed death and subsequent playing of the character by her &quot;sister&quot;.<br>
<br>
There never was a Denise.<br>
<br>
There never was a Kerryn (Or Kerrin, as he himself misspelled it recently while signing a post).<br>
<br>
There has always been David.<br>
<br>
Due to &quot;Daglett&quot;'s convincing portrayal and often friendly and heplful nature, many of us were grief-stricken by her story, invited her to raids and showered her with gifts and well-wishes.<br>
<br>
Her reported painful &quot;death&quot; after a long battle with cancer came as a shock to many of us.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, her &quot;sister&quot; Kerryn supposedly took over the character in honor of her sister. She is now selling boatloads of equipment on the Phoenix Crusaders message board. We can only assume that wares that were given in good faith by many sympathetic to Daglett's supposed plight are amongst the items presented. <br>
<br>
Please be advised that the owner of the account, although personable, has woven a web of lies and deceit that left many of our guild horrified.<br>
<br>
Although we are glad no real harm came to &quot;Denise&quot; other than that her fictional lifetime had come to an end, we resent the preying on the guild's considerable kindness for one person's perverse enjoyment and enrichment.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Guild Elders Council<br>
Phoenix Crusaders<br>

I am appaulled at this garbage that has been posted here.<br>
<br>
I am the RL Sister of Denise, who was not a fictional character made up by another individual.  It appauls me to read such crap being posted about someone that would have giving everything of herself for the guild that shamelessly posted such a thread.  Yes at one stage early in the life of Daglett Deigratia there was a person named David running the character and who owned the account, but for a long time now the account has been owned and run by my sister, Denise who did lose a long battle with cancer.<br>
<br>
And regarding the equipment that is currently for sale, has not come from an individual other then what was in her bank.  I have not even logged onto Everquest using any account belonging to Denise or anyone else to sell items or even play since her passing away, it appuals me to think that people that once were her friends could even suggest that I would do such a thing.  But I can resolve this quite easily by not selling abything that is useless to any character that she had and simply letting it be destroyed.<br>
<br>
I have a huge hole in my heart from having read this post and it makes me feel sick to the stomach to think that people that she thought were her friends would slander her memory like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uskulstalkeremarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skulstalker EMARR</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/26/01 5:32:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> What a fucking tool......</span><hr size=1> While I really like sus's post it is direct and to the point.  I felt the need after reading this reply to respond.  I will warn you now I am no where near as dipolmatic as my friend Sus.  <br>
<br>
First off, Shim/it/heshe or what ever verison of personality you have floating around in your demented brain at this moment please quit actting like a TOOL and shut the bloody fuck up.  You are busted and have certainly not made any friends or reciving anymore sympathy from at least me.<br>
<br>
Second,<br>
On the day you are claiming Denise died I found it very amusing that there was noone by the name of Denise that died on the entire contenent of Australia.  I have a very very reliable souce and friend that I keep in touch with with that is very tied into matters with hospitals, morgues, and other unhappy places in the world.  He placed about 35 phone calls on my behalf and we had an hour long phone conversation on everywhere he spoke with..... Oh yeah I had this conversation twice.....  (once the day of.... the next the 3 days after just to make sure that it wasn't slow paperwork.)  <br>
<br>
Now.... if you would like to go on further here are the ICQ logs that were being spamed to the guild or anyone that was online at this time. All I can say is I hope that when I am dieing of cancer I am able to get rip roaring drunk and chat with people on ICQ 10 min. before I kick off.  <br>

In closing, you have played with people emotions, and brought back some terrible memories of real family members that many of us have had die of cancer.  You need some serious help, but you should be happy that at least one of your several multiple personalites is dead.....  Which I think is all that has been acomplished here.  By the way if you want to pretend to be someone else you should not type with the same constant fucked up mistakes that your alter ego makes.  So please get over yourself.  You make me quite ill.  To put in terms you can understand I would rather take my finger push it through my eye into my brain and move it around then see any one of your 3 characters online again.  While in the past I was pleasent to you and maybe held out the longest to hope you had some shead of truth to your story....  do not contact me ever again.... you psyco dress wearing GUY<br>

<br>
I hope you are pleased about all the people you strung along and hurt.<br>
<br>
I find it appalling that your &quot;sister&quot; was on her &quot;deathbed&quot; and you were chatting on ICQ.<br>
<br>
I find it appalling that 7 days after your &quot;sisters&quot; &quot;death&quot; you had a nice list of equipment to sell to &quot;her&quot; old guildmates.  Also you say you have not been on EQ since &quot;she died&quot;.  Did you compile that list of loot before she &quot;died&quot; just in case?<br>
<br>
I'm happy to say I really didn't know you in game, but I had observed your little tricks.  <br>
&lt;Oops a nice Pally drop&gt; <br>
&lt;Dageltt/Kerryn/Kerrin/Whoever&gt; says-&quot;Hey guys, I have to go visit Dags in the hospital in 15 mins, she's doing so badly.&quot;<br>
&lt;Sympathetic guildmates&gt; say-&quot;Oh hey, why don't you just take that item for Dags then.&quot;<br>
&lt;Daglett/Kerryn/Kerrin/Whoever&gt; then stays another 2 hours.<br>
<br>
You used people for their kindness, played on their sympathies, and when you pulled one trick that people wouldn't swallow, you quit the guild.  Then to make all those bad, bad people just kill themselves with guilt, you made Daglett die.<br>
<br>
Apparently, you had been friendly enough to a certain amount of people, and they were really grieving when they heard the news.  Just the thought of what kind of person you are for doing this sickens me.  I'm sure you must know how many people have really lost friends and family to cancer, myself included.<br>
<br>
As Skul said, you're busted, just let it go.<br>

I speak for the Phoenix Crusaders here and apologise for not making this point in our earlier posts on this unfortunate thread. No offence was intended and I hope this does not muddy the name of Kerryn Darkwater.<br>

<br>
Actually there was a Kerryn. There still is.<br>
<br>
Daglett and I became friends whilst I was still a Phoenix Crusader some time last year. I helped &quot;her&quot; hunt a Ghoulbane and we grouped some more in other places. At the time as any PC member will attest to I was one of the lower members and there were not too many people at the time who could group with me.<br>
<br>
I finally was told by someone that Daglett was actaully a guy and I asked her/him about it...he/she told me that the original player was her brother in law but shed started playing Daglett when her borther in law (who works for Verant) quit playing and she got tired of her level 51 paladin on another server.<br>
<br>
We spent a lot of time grouping together in Sol B but she finally outlevelled me and I left PC anyway.<br>
<br>
Then she came down with her cancer and we chatted on ICQ because she didnt have access to EQ. I was extremely suspicious and told fellow Phoenix members. It was at this point she told me that her sister would play the Daglett character for raids if needed and &quot;its funny really because my real life sister is called Kerrin&quot;<br>
<br>
My first thought is why didnt she mention in the 4 months previous that my name was so similar to her real life sisters. The only conclusion I came to was that I put her on the spot and she took the first name that came into her head whilst speaking to me.<br>
<br>
Daglett has since had about 8 Kidneys removed from posts that Ive seen and numerous conversations buyt last time I spoke to here she was on the mend and had been given the all clear by the doctors. <br>
<br>
Id even been told by her sister Kerrin that she was much better now and that she was thankful for all the support that PC gave them in their time of need.<br>
I last spoke to Daggy about 4 weeks ago. Daggy being the name of her rogue. I havent seen the Daglett character in ages.<br>
<br>
I will be speaking to Phoenix Crusader members over the next few days to try and find out what actually has gone on.<br>
<br>
Sus...you might have mentioned it wasnt me but I wont hold that against you. <p><HTML><CENTER>

My father was diagnosed in Jan of 2000 with lung cancer, despite chemotherapy, 3 surgery's and 2 non-invasive laser procedures to remove the cancer he passed away in October.<br>

I will do all in my power to ensure that you are not able to use people the way you have done so far, links to this post are being added to my guild's msg board and will probably spread to other boards as well.<br>

I'm very sorry, it never occurred to me that someone might mistake the name with your in-game name.<br>
<br>
I want to make it again very clear that &quot;Kerryn&quot; in the original post has NO correlation whatsoever to the character &quot;Kerryn Darkwater&quot;. <br>
<br>
It was the supposed &quot;real life name&quot; of the supposed Denise's sister.<br>
<br>
The reason I brought it up is because he/she spelled her on name when signing posts either &quot;Kerryn&quot; or &quot;Kerrin&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, sorry for the confusion.<br>

I think it is totally despicable that anyone would make a joke out of this life threatening disease, or take advantage of the sympathy of good hearted individuals on the behalf of 'cancer'.<br>

I don't know what kind of person you are, but I can guarantee that you will one day pay the price for this cruel joke. I am personally affronted that you would try to convince people that you were dying of cancer just to get cool stuff on a GAME!!! <p>Bright Blessings,

'Daglett', whoever you are, you're sick. You need help. I'm serious. Normal, balanced people don't put others through what you did for 'fun'.<br>

On a more practical note, surely this persons account can be banned. Does anyone know how verants policy covers something like this? Personally I'd be happy if this persons credit details were blacklisted and s/he wasn't able to get on another online game because of it.<br>

It all fits together really:  Daglett was, as far as i know, last in my guild, Prophecy of Fear, something which I was glad to acknowledge at the time.  Then, all of the sudden, she/he says they have grown tired of EQ so will be taking a break, i think it was something like an extended break, from EQ and so de-guilded.  That's the last I heard until now. <br>

Kudos to the people that tracked down the facts.  So it goes with life.  We all have an exquisite example of exactly how morally corrupt people can be.  Cherish the example, and be glad you weren't hurt more than you have been.  <br>

<br>
Yeah, got a couple of people log in just to tell me to Fuck off. Some ignored me and for that reason Im bumping both of these posts.<br>
<br>
On looking through the PCs boards I see that in one post she actually referred to herself as Kerrin and in a later post on the same thread named herself as Kerryn and that was why Susp posted as he did above.<br>
<br>
Daglett I considered a friend. She was and still is on my /friends list (just so I can talk to him/her to see whats going on in that head). For her to have pulled off this whole stunt makes me think he/she was after attention that was missed elsewhere and to some extent can be forgiven. Sickness in any form is not to be met with by anger.<br>
<br>
BUT....as for posting my name? That was done with malicious intent and I am very narked that she singled me out in this way. Possibly because I was the most gullible hey Dags?<br>
<br>
I realised this though after Id thought it all through. I had my suspicions as I mentioned to others yet I still offered my support. I can walk away knowing that I was there when it mattered and did the right thing. As it turns out I was scammed just as much as any yet I did what I felt was best and what I would do tommorow if someone told me they were dying of aids/cancer/&lt;insert other serious disease here&gt;<br>
<br>
I guess what Im trying to say Daglett/David/Kerrin/Percy is that right is right. <p><HTML><CENTER>
