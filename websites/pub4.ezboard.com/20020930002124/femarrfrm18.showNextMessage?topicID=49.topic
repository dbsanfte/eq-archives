THEY don't have very many nukes.  I took a course on nuclear arms control 2 quarters ago for christ's sake.  At most they have maybe 20 nukes, and we can shoot them down.  The sooner we strike, the fewer nukes they'll have operational.  Fucking Palastinian people CELEBRATING this on TV.  OMFG.<br>

What we need to do is nuke Afghanistan all to hell.  I mean kill everyone there, the kids, the old people, EVERYONE.  Eliminate the entire culture so that kind of bullshit doesn't happen again.  We didn't mess around with Japan.<br>

There were some old movies discussing this and supporting this ideal from the 40's, but I couldn't tell you what they were saying because they were all in GERMAN.<br>
<br>
What's important to remember is that Afghanistan is a propoganda state. The government only shows America through a narrow looking glass, declaring it the devil. To them, Americans are the people who wiped out the Iraqi nation for oil, who gave weapons to fuel hatred in the Middle East, and whos companies destroys their economy and keeps their nation in a perpetual state of poverty. If you were in the same position as they were, you'd celebrate too.<br>
<br>
But you're not.<br>
<br>
You're in the freest nation in the world, and you know better.<br>
<br>
What saddens me is that you, and everyone reading this,  knows better than the only answer should be "Nuke em all".<br>
<br>
But, I know, I know, you're feeling helpless and angry, scared for the future. Well, WELCOME TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. When you read of car bombs in the Middle East, you think they were apathetic about it? Of course not. They feel exactly how you do right now.<br>
<br>
We've always been told that war isn't the answer, and it's easy for the post-Vietnam war generation to say that, but what we, you, everyone has to realize is that this is no exception to that rule.<br>
<br>
What do we do from here?<br>

The &quot;nuke em' all&quot; may not be the best way to handle this, but it would certainly make alot of people happy right now.<br>
<br>
Personally, at this point i say bomb them all. But like i said im very angry with the events today and that there are people in this world willing to do such an act. When we calm down and get this under control the people responsible will be dealt with swiftly.<br>
<br>
Reporter said- &quot;The free world was attacked today, and civilization has the right to defend itself.&quot;<br>
And well get alot of support spearheading this.<br>
<br>
Reporter said- &quot;revenge is best served cold.&quot;<br>
<br>
This isnt revenge anymore, its vengeance.<br>
<br>
If we counterattack in revenge, they will strike back later with another cowardly attack as seen today. This evil needs to be eradicated or it will never end.<br>
Car bombs get some retaliation. They commited an act of war and mass murder on innocent civilians in the heart of the most powerful nation in the world. Retaliation is the PC way of saying whats soon to come.  And the free world will support any action we decide to take.<br>
<br>
Ive said it before, please keep the civilians and rescue personel that lost their lives today in your thoughts and prayers.<br>

<br>
But I don't think we should let our nationalism blind us to the fact that we are all human beings; Afghani, American, whatever. Afghani's are humans, no different from us. To simply press a button would be the short-term American quick-fix answer to the problem, which will lead to placation of the masses, until something like this happens again, and it will.<br>
<br>
The best answer now would be to asses the situation, and deal with it at a calm pace.<br>

All I said was don't blame a nation or religion for what a group of people do.  The same way you can't blame America for what Timothy McVeigh did.  Get it yet?<br>
<br>
Just because this may be a war does not justify hating people who condemn this behavior.  And try reading what the President said.  He said he would go after those who are the terrorists as well as those who are harboring them.  I did not see one word about him saying a whole nation or religion is responsible.  At least he is smart enough to only seek those who approve this behavior rather than anyone from the same country or religion as the guilty parties.<br>

<br>
The old law of &quot;eye for and eye&quot; is being cried for.<br>
<br>
If we strike at them, they will strike back in defiance.  Yet, if we don't strike back, they will take it as a sign of weakness and strike again because they know they got us by the balls.  If we take the guy responsable and simply imprison him, his followers will take hostages and demand his release.  If we kill the man responsible, he will become a matyre which will fuel the fires of his cause even more.<br>
<br>
I see us in a no win situation here.  Personally, I'd rather be viewed as a nation that doesn't take shit from nobody, thus I advocate a military strike against those responsible and those who harbor them.  No more, no less.<br>

The children who are programmed to hate America, that is a sticky situation.</font><br>
<br>
I will condemn the entire nation, the nation which knowingly harbored said terrorists for many years and continually threw road-blocks up in front of the United States when we wanted to take them out, they should most certainly receive part of the blame. At this very moment Afghanistan is trying to do it again, they are asking for concrete evidence that Bin Laden is responsible for this particular atrocity before they take the slightest action. It doesn’t matter that we know he was responsible for other terrorist activities or that he’s applauding, publicly, the people who did this(trying to throw suspicion off himself, as if it matters at this point).<br>
<br>
As of right now, as they pull more bodies from what were the World Trade Center towers, there is no line of demarcation. There are no longer varying degrees of terrorist activity. Whether you set off a car bomb and injure one-person or fly a 747 into a building killing thousands, you are all in the same boat – dead. Whether you were the one that planted the bomb or the one who gave the order, or conspired with said persons you are all headed for the same outcome – death.<br>
<br>
Call me callous, call me evil, but those children need to meet a swift and untimely demise at the same time their heroes do. These aren't ‘innocent’ children we’re talking about, these are kids that are taught to hate Americans from the age of comprehension on. When our children are going to school and learning Algebra, these kids are learning to fire an AK-47. These are kids that are, at this very moment, thinking to themselves that when they grow up they want to crash a bigger plane into a bigger building and one-up the zealots of Tuesday’s attack. I'm sorry, or maybe I'm not, but these aren't children… they’re weapons. <p><b>Vendrix</b><br>

I do feel that we should make those nations that harbor terrorists pay though.  This includes people of all ages and sex.  Allowing Terrorist supporters/followers to live, only creates a new generation of Martyrs and aspiring terrorists.<br>

<br>
"May God have mercy on them...because we won't."<br>
<br>
And to those saying this is all blind rage or whatever creative words you want to use...its called zero tolerance (Do you know that means? Cause its US policy), if you let them attack and do nothing or try and forgive they will laugh in your face and hurt you more. (Just as this happened because we refused to act on terroism swiftly enough in the past)  As sad as it is to believe, you have to fight these fires with bigger fires, its the only true way to get through to these kinds of people.  How do you talk calmly with a people that hate you more than anything, these aren't rational people, they are slaves and weapons to their leaders and its sad..<br>
<br>
As for what Bush said, his statement did nothing more then give the entire world a go ahead to make this area, which has done little more then bicker over oil, and terroize the world, a glass desert....innocents will be lost, but more will be lost if we do nothing.  <br>
<br>
"A man cannot strike at you if you leave them with no way to do so..."<br>
<br>
As for mentioning Hiroshima (believe this was another thread, but I'm posting my thoughts together), hindsight is 20/20 isn't it? Truman made one of if not the hardest calls in history, dropping a bomb that they couldn't even comprehend at that time on a city.  Do you understand we dropped that bomb, having little knowledge of what the affects would be on them? We did it to save lives not end them, as someone said the death toll had we not ended the war swiftly, would have been in the hundred of thousands, if not millions.<br>
<br>
And as for all this pointless name calling and insult slingling, knock it the fuck off.  We need to come together and be one, not call each other names.  Hell, even Mitch and Dwarkarn agreed on that, (another thread) doesn't that show you people that you need to cut the shit and act like adults for once, this isn't some ingame thing we are arguing about, this is very very real.  <br>
<br>
And whether you like it or not, this does in a very big way affect our Freedom, its our 'move' now, alot depends on what we do, and I'll tell you right now its not letting these people responsible get away with what they have done.  They destroyed one of the most AMERICAN landmarks in this country, they struck a blow to our security and our freedom, are you all so blind that you can't see that?  Now is the time we rise up Sronger then before, and More together as a people.  I feel ashamned, Very Fucking Ashamned, if you would rather go sit in your little room and do nothing, that is the true cowardness... you safety, the safety of the world is in danger, stand the hell up and fight for what your fathers and your fathers fathers, and so on, fought for so long ago, so that you could enjoy this freedom you have today...you can't hid under your covers or behind mommy from this anymore, we did that long enough, no more...<br>
<br>
Wake up from your sheltered dream, wake up and realize its time we stop letting our freedom be a target...<br>

No one really comprehends what that entails. Do you realize how difficult it would be to eradicate every person in a country? I would say impossible is a pretty accurate word. Not too mention, that would never be an option in the mind of our government or military.<br>
<br>
You need to realize that most of us aren't blaming every person of said terrorist nation, we are blaming the government that hides them and the people that support them… that’s not everyone. There are truly innocent people who don’t advocate violent acts dwelling within these countries. I would never seek to decimate them based on the actions of some of their countrymen.<br>
<br>
What I am suggesting is to strike at the government, its military, its infrastructure and cripple it as a nation until it realizes the mistake its making, and has made for many years, by harboring terrorists within. I want to make terrorists turn from the gleaming symbol of righteousness they are now to the focus of every man, woman and child’s pain and despair. Once that happens, they won’t only have to fear us… they’ll have to fear every person in the country they live in.<br>

When was the last time anyone in the real world actually said this? Out with the Hollywood and in with the reality, g’damn! The news for the past two days, although sometimes it seems so, isn't showing you a preview for the next Arnold Schwazenegger movie. Those really are the World Trade Center builds in a smoking pile of rubble and that really is the Pentagon missing an entire section. People really are dead - a lot of people. In very basic terms, they threw the first punch and it landed soundly in the gut of America. For one, I'm tired of being hit by these insignificant little pieces of shit. I want them out, I want them removed from the equation permanently. I want pro-active anti-terrorism worldwide. If a radical group pops up in X nation they should be eliminated before they become an issue.<br>
