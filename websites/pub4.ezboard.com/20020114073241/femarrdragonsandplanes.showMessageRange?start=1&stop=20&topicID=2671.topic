<br>
Chances are you will need to fill the 2nd exp bar....then choose this skill....then you will have 1 useage of 100% exp rez.<br>
<br>
Then once used...you will earn it again<br>
<br>
lets assume the skill requires a few hours to gain....<br>
4% exp loss or 4 hours lost game.....<br>
<br>
The epic will remain invaluable for quickly rezzing failed raids etc.  If you can use it more than once...the recast time will be GOD LIKE...prolly 1 hour or something.<br>
<br>
just my pence<br>

Most of the things listed are outrageously unbalancing and/or just plain stupid.  Some of them seem at least plausible, but others . . . sheesh.<br>
<br>
Comments on some of them . . . I don't have experience with all classes, so pardon any errors.<br>
<br>
&quot;Acrobatics - This ability will reduce the damage taken from falling.&quot;  So the skill of Safe Fall is being renamed, removed, or what?<br>
<br>
&quot;Strong Root - This ability will give the player a lure save root.&quot;  Riiiight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mass Group Buff - This ability will turn your next group buff into an beneficial area effect spell. Hitting everyone within its radius.&quot;  Isn't that what /targetgroupbuff was supposed to do?<br>
<br>
&quot;Spell Casting Fury 2 - This ability gives the player an increased percent chance to critical with direct damage spells.&quot;  Admittedly, my highest spellcaster is only level 22, but so far I've never seen a &quot;critical hit&quot; message with a DD spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Extended Buff - This ability increases the duration of beneficial buffs by an additional 20 percent.&quot;  I fail to see what the reason for this is.  Isn't the duration of most buffs determined by the caster's level to some degree?  I don't see why this should change.<br>
<br>
Warrior<br>
<br>
&quot;Bandage Wound - This ability will give the player increased healing capabilities through bandage by 10, 25, and 50 percent.&quot;  I can see how this might be useful to a class that's commonly the primary tank in a group, but I'm a bit iffy on it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Warcry - This ability will allow the player to give their entire group immunity to fear for a period of time based on skill level.&quot;  I often play Werewolf: the Apocalypse . . . is this like the Inspiration Gift?  Regardless, if I'm a fragile little caster in the back, having some big armored lunk out front bellowing and carrying on as he shoves his sword under the dragon's toenail isn't necessarily going to make me feel all that much safer when its great big bloody mouth opens up and it zaps the entire group with magic halitosis.<br>
<br>
&quot;Area Taunt - This ability will allow for the player to taunt everything in a small radius.&quot;  This actually is something I'd like to see.  The above notation about the big armored lunk bellowing and carrying on might not be too impressive against a huge dragon, but the image of a whole buncha gnolls saying &quot;WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT OUR MOMMA?!&quot; is fun.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rampage - This ability will allow for the player to attack everything in a small radius.&quot;  I don't know if I'd call it Rampage.  How about &quot;Drunken Flailing&quot;?  Intoxicated barbarian warriors are fun!<br>
<br>
&quot;Flurry - This ability will allow for the player to have up to 2 additional attacks off of their primary hand.&quot;  What, and take the multiple arsebeating title away from the monks?<br>
<br>
Rogue<br>
<br>
&quot;Purge Poison - This ability will remove all poison affects from the player.&quot;  I'd like justification for this.  Just because you know how to make poison doesn't mean you know how to remove it from yourself.  Being able to toxify the rats under your baseboards also doesn't mean that you know how to treat a spider bite.<br>
<br>
&quot;Purifying Tonic - Moderate Poison and Disease Cure&quot;  Are they TRYING to irritate shamans and clerics here?<br>
<br>
&quot;Quick Throw - This ability will allow the player to have additional throwing attacks on one throw.&quot;  Never lose bets on barroom dart games again!<br>
<br>
&quot;Throwing Mastery - This ability will give an increased chance to critical by 5, 15, and 30 percent.&quot;  The only character I have that's ever used Throwing in combat has a grand skill level of 2.  *Does* Throwing do criticals?<br>
<br>
&quot;Shadow - This ability will remove the player from all hate lists. If the player is out of immediate combat, this ability will also make them invisible similar to their hide ability.&quot;  Having watched a level 52 dark elf rogue successfully sneak/hide right past the guards in East Cabilis and apparently evade the Crusaders wandering around, I'd say they don't need much help on this.<br>
<br>
Monk<br>
<br>
&quot;Return Kick - This ability gives the player the chance to do a flying kick attack on ripostes in addition to the normal riposte attack.&quot;  I partner with a monk most of the time.  The combat spam is scary enough right now.  This would make it truly mindblowing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rapid Feign - This ability reduces the players reuses time on feign death by 10, 25, and 50 percent.&quot;  This would be VERY useful.  A failed FD has a good chance of not only smearing the monk, but plonking the rest of the group if the pull's gone very badly indeed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chain Combo - This ability gives the player a chance to string a number of special attacks together.&quot;  Do the Verant game designers play Vagrant Story, too?<br>
<br>
&quot;Purify Body - This ability removes all negative affects from their body except for fear, charm, resurrection affects.&quot;  Can someone please spell &quot;effects&quot; correctly?<br>
<br>
&quot;Critical Mend - This ability gives the player a chance to do a super mend 5, 10, and 25 percent of the time.&quot;  Another thing that would be useful when the cleric's OOM.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dragon Punch - This ability will give the player the ability to proc a knock back spell off of Dragon Punch.&quot;  Aw, but then the monk has to CHASE the mob to finish beating it to death!<br>
<br>
Bard<br>
<br>
&quot;Snake Charm - This ability gives the player the chance to charm an NPC as long as they have mana. The spell will follow normal level 49 charm rules.&quot;  If this ability is available at level 1 or so, this is hugely unbalancing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jam Fest - Allows the player to sing their songs at a higher casting level. Note: This does not allow them tossing songs that are higher then their level.&quot;  So what DOES it allow, exactly?<br>
<br>
Shadowknight<br>
<br>
&quot;Enhanced Vampirism - This ability gives the player increased damage off of their self buff lifetap procs.&quot;  Isn't that what the Lifetap line is FOR?<br>
<br>
&quot;Death Peace - This ability moves the spell Death Peace to a hotkey freeing a spell slot.&quot;  This annoys me a lot.  There are reasons why those are spells, not abilities, and I don't see reasons to change them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leech Touch - This ability gives the player a life tap harm touch.&quot;  Here's an idea.  There's Harm Touch.  And then there's Lifetap spells.  And never the twain shall meet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Super Harm Touch - This ability gives the player a low resist Harm Touch.&quot;  I dunno, I get the giggles reading this one.  Sounds like an anime attack phrase.  &quot;SUPAAAA HALLLLLM TOOCH!&quot;  *zap!*<br>
<br>
&quot;Unholy Steed - This ability will give the player the ultimate unholy steed.&quot;  Buy a ridiculously expensive whistle like everyone else.  God, I'm not looking forward to stupid horses in Luclin.<br>
<br>
Ranger<br>
<br>
&quot;Endless Quiver - This ability allows the player to shoot magical arrows that scale in damage based on skill level.&quot;  I kinda like this one.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fletching/Bowyer Mastery - This ability reduces the chance of failing on an fletching combinations by 10, 25, and 50 percent.&quot;  Makes sense, but I really like ANYTHING that cuts the chances of seeing that damn message &quot;You lacked the skills to create this item&quot; when your skill is in triple digits.<br>
<br>
&quot;Archery Mastery - This ability gives the player to increase their archery damage from 100 to 200 percent.&quot;  This one and the first one aren't both needed, IMHO.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dual Mastery - This ability increases the players chance to use dual wield successfully.&quot;  Then why isn't it also noted under Warrior skills?<br>
<br>
&quot;Innate Camouflage - This ability allows the player to become invisible without the need to memorize a spell.&quot;  Thus meaning that if you spent so much as 1cp on a spell, you wasted yer money, Sunny Jim.<br>
<br>
Paladin<br>
<br>
&quot;2 Hand Bash - This ability will allow the player to bash with any 2-handed weapon.&quot;  Get a shield, will you?<br>
<br>
&quot;Fearless - This ability makes the player permanently immune to fear spells.&quot;  Way, way overpowered.  More convenient, I'll grant you, but overpowered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Holy Steed - This ability will give the player the ultimate holy steed.&quot;  See above.  Buy a freaking whistle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Act of Valor - This ability will allow the player to transfer all of their hitpoints to a target PC.&quot;  Thus killing themselves?  I can see this getting about as much use as an air conditioner at the North Pole.<br>
<br>
&quot;Slay Undead - This ability will turn the players crits into massive damage when fighting undead monsters.&quot;  Isn't that what undead nuke spells are for?  In fact, wouldn't this make better sense if it was inherent in some nifty weapon?<br>
<br>
&quot;Improved Lay of Hands - This ability will turn the players Lay of Hands into a complete heal.&quot;  That would be nice, but it might aggravate the clerics.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pally Stun - This ability will allow the player to have the chance to stun NPC's with spells up to level 60. Normal resist rules apply.&quot;  How about stunning them by hitting them with your shield instead?  Or keeping them from snacking on the enchanter who's able to stun them?  What a concept!<br>
<br>
Necromancer<br>
<br>
&quot;Call to Corpse - Allows the player to cast a no component summon corpse spell.&quot;  This would be incredibly cool, but phenomenally unbalancing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Transmute Flesh to Bone - Allows the player to turn any non-magical meat or body part item into bone chips. You must hold the item on your cursor.&quot;  This would be a nifty spell, but doesn't seem appropriate as an ability.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mass Fear - Allows the player to cast an AE low resist fear spell.<br>
Dead Mesmerization - This ability allows the player to cast an AE low resist undead mesmerization spell. <br>
Life Burn - This ability allows the player to cast a low resist direct damage spell equal to that of their current hitpoints. The player will be set to 1 hit point and their will be a mana cost to the spell. The life tap component of the spell will happen over time.&quot;  I'm seeing the word &quot;spell&quot; a lot in here and the last one even has a mana cost--SO MAKE THEM SPELLS, NOT ABILITIES!<br>
<br>
Magician<br>
<br>
&quot;Free Pet - This ability removes the component cost of summoning pets.&quot;  I can hear the magicians cheering even now.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Unsummon NPC - This ability will allow the player to unsummon or banish all summoned NPC's in a radius.&quot;  I can't hear myself think for all the cheering now . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Improved Reclaim Energy - This ability will increase the amount of mana returned to the player when reclaiming their pet.&quot;  What, pet casting is now the same as bank loans with an interest rate?  Wow!  Pets are not only friendly little tanks, they're investments!<br>
<br>
&quot;Elemental Form - This ability will allow the player to turn into this elemental type gaining many of the benefits innate to the NPC.&quot;  Quit stealing the enchanters' schtick.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frenzied Burnout - This ability allows the player to cast a buff on his pet that will cause it to go bezerk doing increased damage. When the effect wears off the pet will explode damaging everything around it.&quot;  So it's a buff that turns your pet into a little time bomb.  Make it a spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quick Summoning - This ability reduces the casting time of summoning spells by 10, 25, and 50 percent.&quot;  I have to disagree with anything that alters the casting time on spells . . . those are set for a reason.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pet Lay of Hands - This ability allows the player to cast a Lay of Hands type spell on their pet.&quot;  Pet healing SPELL.  SPELL, not ABILITY.<br>
<br>
&quot;Restore Companion - Increase Hit Points (HP) from 34 (L1) to 1981 (L60)&quot;  Healing SPELL, dammit.<br>
<br>
Enchanter<br>
<br>
&quot;Gather Mana - This ability allows the player to recover all their mana.&quot;  The cheering of the enchanters is overwhelming, but this is very unbalancing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jewel Craft Mastery - This ability reduces the chance of failing on an jewel craft combinations by 10, 25, and 50 percent.&quot;  Since jewelcraft is possibly the single most bloody expensive tradeskills out there, anything that drops the chance of &quot;you lacked the skills to create this little trivial item&quot; is way up on my happy list.<br>
<br>
&quot;Permanent Illusion - This ability allows for the caster to zone without losing their illusion.&quot;  That'd sure be nice.<br>
<br>
Wizard<br>
<br>
&quot;Nexus Gate - This ability gives the player an instant cast evacuate spell to the Nexus.&quot;  All together, kids!  &quot;MAKE IT A SPELL!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Improved Familiar - This ability gives the players familiar increases hit points and defensive capabilities.&quot;  So it's a buff, right?<br>
<br>
&quot;Mana Burn - This ability allows the player to do low resist damage equal to that of his current mana.&quot;  What?  Wizards don't have ENOUGH DD spells??<br>
<br>
Shaman<br>
<br>
&quot;Rabid Bear - This ability turns the player into a Rabid Bear, boosting all his offense capabilities.&quot;  So it's a spell, right?<br>
<br>
&quot;Alchemy Mastery - This ability reduces the chance of failing on an alchemy combinations by 10, 25, and 50 percent.&quot;  See previous comments on anything that actually lets you get decent usage out of your tradeskills without having them poop out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quick Buff - This ability reduces the casting time of beneficial spells with a duration by 10, 25 and 50 percent. Some spells may be excluded.&quot;  See previous about casting times.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cannabalize IV - This ability will give the caster a new canabalize spell.&quot;  You mean &quot;cannibalize&quot;?  AND IT'S A SPELL, RIGHT?<br>
<br>
Druid<br>
<br>
&quot;Dire Charm - This ability gives the caster the chance to permanently charm an NPC. The spell will follow normal level 49 charm rules.&quot;  And will be insanely, disgustingly unbalanced.  If any class would logically have this cheesy power, it should be the enchanters.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enhanced Root - This ability reduces the chance that the NPC will break root against direct damage spells cast by the player with this ability.&quot;  How about just improving the root spells themselves?<br>
<br>
&quot;Quick Direct Damage - This ability reduces the casting time on direct damage spells by 2, 5 and 10 percent.&quot;  Same as above objections.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exodus - This ability gives the caster the ability to cast an instant casting no mana cost evacuation or succour spell.&quot;  Should I just do the &quot;MAKE IT A SPELL&quot; dance all day here?<br>
<br>
&quot;Quick Evacuation - This ability reduces the casting time on evacuation and succour spells by 10, 25, and 50 percent.&quot;  We've been over this already . . .<br>
<br>
Cleric<br>
<br>
&quot;Purify Soul - This ability allows the player to cast a spell that cures all ailments except for charm, fear and resurrection affects.<br>
Turn Undead - This ability gives a player a AE spell against undead that starts out just doing damage and finishes with banishment. <br>
Bestow Divine Aura - This ability gives the player the ability to cast a Divine Aura spell on a PC target. <br>
Celestial Regeneration - This ability gives the player the ability to cast large heal over time spell at no mana cost. <br>
Innate Invis to Undead - This ability allows the player to become invisible versus undead without the need to memorize a spell.&quot;  I'm doing the dance now!  La la la, new spells instead of cheesy abilities, la la la, shake your booty . . .<br>
<br>
&quot;Divine Resurrection - This ability allows the player to provide a resurrection that provides 100 percent experience return.&quot;  So that Water-Sprinkler of Nem Ankh is just going to be a cute little stick that takes huge amounts of time to get?  Puhleeze.<br>
<br>
Melee/Hybrid Abilities<br>
<br>
&quot;Avoidance Boost - This ability increases the players avoidance ability to melee damage by 2, 5 and 10 percent.<br>
Mitigation Boost - This ability increases the players mitigation ability to melee damage by 2, 5, and 10 percent.&quot;  Why?<br>
<br>
&quot;Finishing Blow - This ability gives the person a chance to finish a fleeing mob off. The NPC must be below 10 percent health and fleeing. Note: non-warriors must first place 1 skill point into Critical Boost before this skill will work.&quot;  So, basically, it just means you don't have to spend the extra few seconds to run after the mob and whack it to death.  Whoopty.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fear Resistance - This ability gives a bonus resistance to fear type spells of 5, 10, and 25 percent. It also increases the chance of breaking fear.&quot;  Isn't that what magic resist gear/buffs are for?<br>
<br>
&quot;Critical Boost - This ability increases the chance to land a critical hit. Percentages are dependant on class.&quot;  Sure.  Okay.<br>
<br>
&quot;Improved Natural Durability - This ability increases the max hitpoints of the player by 2, 5, and 10 percent.&quot;  Buy stamina at creation.<br>
<br>
Pure Caster/Healer Abilities<br>
<br>
&quot;Spell Casting Deftness - This ability reduces the casting time of beneficial spells with a cast time greater then 4 seconds. Percentages are approx. 5, 15, and 25 percent.&quot;  I repeat it one more time . . . the casting times are what they are for good reasons.  I don't always agree with them, but I can understand that there are reasons.<br>
<br>
&quot;Spell Casting Expertise - This ability removes the possibility for the caster to fizzle a spell. First level removes chance of fizzle on spell below 20, second level below 35, and third level below 52.&quot;  Isn't that what specialize is for?<br>
<br>
&quot;Spell Casting Subtlety - This ability reduces the amount of hate generated by a spell by 5, 10, and 20 percent.&quot;  It's the risk you take for tashing/charming/nuking the hell out of the mob, guys.<br>
<br>
&quot;Channelling Focus - This ability increases max channelling to reduct the chance of being interrupted. Percentages are approx. 5, 10, and 15 percent reduction in being interrupted.&quot;  I wouldn't mind this.  Though actually, what normally pisses me off about casting is that I can stand there and keep concentration while a mob is pounding the bejezus out of me, but if I so much as *brush* a forward/backward arrow key, I immediately get an interrupt.  Sheesh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Spell Casting Fury - This ability gives the caster a chance to land a critical hit with their direct damage spell. Percentages are 2, 4, and 7 percent increase chance to critical.&quot;  Max damage is there for a reason, right?  Wouldn't a critical hit with Sunstrike be disgusting?<br>
<br>
&quot;Mental Clarity - This ability increases natural mana regeneration by 1 point per skill level.&quot;  How about you guys stop trying to piss off the enchanters?<br>
<br>
&quot;Spell Casting Reinforcement - This ability increases the duration of beneficial spells by 5, 15, and 30 percent.&quot;  There's a duration based on level, that's all that is needed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Spell Casting Mastery - This ability gives an increased chance of making your specialization skill of that spell casting ability. This works for all spell casting types. The result is a less chance to fizzle and greater chance of reduction of mana cost for the spell. Percentages are 5, 15, and 30 percent chance of reduction.&quot;  It'd be nice, if it made sense.<br>
<br>
Healer Class Skills<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing Gift - This ability gives the priest a chance to cast a critical heal by 3, 6, and 9 percent. This will double the healing value of the spell&quot;  How about buying the higher-level spells just like we've always done?<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing Adept - This ability increases the max value of healing spells by 2, 5, and 10 percent.&quot;  See above.<br>
<br>
General Skills<br>
<br>
&quot;First Aid - This ability increases that max that you can bind wound by 10 percent for each skill level.&quot;  Might be rather nice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Improved Natural...&quot;  Not going to burn more space with this list.  Suffice to say that if you want boosted stats, get items with those stat bonuses or spend the points at creation.<br>

I can appreciate you playing devil's advocate on every skill, and I'd like to rebutt to show the pro's of the skills.  But that would be just too damn long, so I'll just comment on my class's skills.  Paladin's.<br>
<br>
Fearless - Way overpowered my fucking ass, I've been lacking in skills that would make me a big benefit to a high end encounter over an extended period of time.  With this skill, and Gorenaire for example.  A ton of ppl get feared, all except me, I stand and fight and hopefully keep Gore from summoning back the feared casters/healers and beating their asses into pulp.  Granted I won't last long with my healer feared, I'm sure I can tank long enough for the MA to get back from being feared.<br>
<br>
2h Bash - Get a shield will I?  What if I'm fighting an NPC like Venril Sathir?  Do I want to use a fast 1hander and shield to get more life tap proc's taken out of my ass, or Do I want to use a high dmg 2hander?  The bash on a 2hander will have limited uses, but it'll be fun, not big enough reason to knock it.  <br>
<br>
Holy Steed - Buy a freaking whistle?  I'm see'ing this as payback for all the AC's that were stolen from me by goddam druid's and shamen, and other long range casting class's.  You buy a whistle.  I still don't have goddam Jboots after 2+ years.<br>
<br>
Act of Valor - Being that I only have 1 LoH, and a good connection to the net, I can keep a damn good eye on my MA during a high end encounter.  Do you have any idea how many time's I could have saved a raid if I had 2 LoH's?  Sacrificing myself to save the MA and quite possibly the raid, is something I'll be damn happy to do and I plan on doing it.<br>
<br>
Slay Undead - I agree with you, I'd like to see this effect on nifty weapons, and somehow I think I will.  Have you seen the cast time on my undead nuke spells?  Not to mention the highest one I have at lvl 60 only does 237(or 273) points of dmg and really puts a drain on my smaller mana pool.  And also, you have no idea how many time's I've used my 'holyforge' discipline and never gotten a single crit during it's duration.  This skill would only affect my hits during activation of that discipline.  <br>
<br>
Improved Lay of Hands - This should have been a complete heal since day 1.  How can 1 LoH every 60 minutes aggrivate a cleric? /boggle<br>
<br>
Pally Stun - Same argument as Fearless.  This is going to be the kicker for Paladin's.  This will be the first skill I go for, and it is going to improve raid's immensely if it sticks.  HELL YES  woot!  Enchanters will tell you on high end raids that they already have an assload of things to do beside's worry about stuns, if they live past the Tash..  What a concept!<br>

High level mobs generally *cannot* be stunned (enchanters aren't special, they get the same results too).  This means, even if the stun message hits, the mob still goes on its merry way doing whatever it was doing before.  The way I read this spell means we can now interrupt those nasty mobs who were never interruptable before....if we can get the spell to land.<br>
<br>
Holy Steed - Hell yea, I remember spending half a year being KS'd be every 2cp spellcaster out there until I was finally able to find an ancient cyclops in a zone completely devoid of casters. Low damage output = at the mercy of every other asshole. Plus horsies will be awesome if they are faster than sow(but less than selo's i believe).<br>
<br>
Undead Slaying - they really better be turning holyforge into a full time ability and not some cheesy once every 72min gimmick.<br>
<br>
2-Hand bash - definately useful considering bash is one of our specialties and 2h weapons are alot more better now.<br>
<br>
Fearless - Definately useful so *someone* is still healing the poor main tank or someone who has a chance of tanking is not fleeing in terror.<br>
<br>
Act of Valor - this one should be interesting. gonna need to see how it works.<br>

I'm generally disposed not to like the horse thing anyway . . . I will say that it would be appropriate for Paladins and SKs to get them, but not necessarily as a skill.  Unless they're going to put wild horses in the game, and this skill was the ability to tame and train a noble war steed.  Being able to pull a Frisian out of your bung isn't a skill unless you're David Copperfield.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I do apologize for what, after re-reading the actual line, was a misunderstanding on my part.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pally Stun - This ability will allow the player to have the chance to stun NPC's with spells up to level 60.&quot;<br>
<br>
What I thought this meant, due to the way the sentence reads, was &quot;Paladins up to level 60 will have the chance to stun NPCs with spells.&quot;  This didn't make sense to me until I re-read the line with enough coffee in me to realize that the actual meaning should probably be &quot;Paladins will have the chance to use spells to stun NPCs that are up to level 60.&quot;<br>

Also true.  Nobody knows at this point, which makes the list free game for debate, questioning, and the occasional bit of ridicule.  I'm still curious to see how Verant's going to be working out the exp system to gain skills, which skills will be kept, and how they'll ultimately work.  That whole long post was just my first impressions (and as has been proven already by the confusion over the pally-stun skill, caffeine is needed in the morning) of the presented list as it is. <p>Sissiraa

I think at the very least they give us a clue as to what to expect.<br>
<br>
These skills are earned through the accrual of experience at 51st level and above.  Supposedly you have two choices for experience gained in those levels--allocating experience towards good ol' leveling, or allocating experience towards the accrual of skill points with which these new Luclin abilities may be purchased.  I've heard that the accrual of just one point requires the equivalent experience that it would take to get through level 51.<br>
<br>
These abilities don't obsolete squat except for the player that chooses to improve themselves in whatever fashion (a dwarf pally gaining the ability to stun with a 2H weapon, for instance, does nothing to &quot;obsolete&quot; a troll SK's slam ability, but may have a significant effect on the dwarf's favoured weapon loadout).  For an ability like divine resurrection, I have a feeling that this manifests as a spell with significant mana cost, etc, and is not a clickfest substitute for the ol' sprinkler.<br>
<br>
And sorry, anyone with a horse (be it gained via special ability or purchase) will be able to magically pop it into a &quot;horse&quot; pocket whenever they enter a zone in which horses are not appropriate.  Which kinda makes me wonder, if they use the current definition of an &quot;outdoor&quot; zone to govern that... will we see horse-mounted characters struggling through the City of Mist? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><HR><IMG SRC="http://www.roguebard.com/images/Chiba/ChibaTenchiSig.gif" HEIGHT=80 WIDTH=180 ALT="Chiba Tenchi, Martial Artiste, Rivervale Defenders, Erollisi Marr"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usissiraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sissiraa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/21/01 12:32:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin Skills</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;Take those skills listed with a grain of salt.&gt;&gt;<br>

Ahhh.  That's information I hadn't run across.  (Or else I did and my short-term memory crapped out on me again.)  With that set of restrictions in mind, the list isn't nearly as worrisome as I thought.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;These abilities don't obsolete squat except for the player that chooses to improve themselves in whatever fashion (a dwarf pally gaining the ability to stun with a 2H weapon, for instance, does nothing to &quot;obsolete&quot; a troll SK's slam ability, but may have a significant effect on the dwarf's favoured weapon loadout).

<br>
I'd honestly prefer to see many of those &quot;abilities&quot; as actual spells . . . though upon contemplation, the idea of a cleric getting a 100% resurrection power with the same kind of recycle time as, say, LoH or HT, is rather neat.  I'd just feel deeply sorry for most of the clerics in the game if that goes live . . . can you imagine the beggars screaming &quot;I NEED FULL REZ PLZ&quot; at hapless clerics who have decided not to get this power?  Or the ones who DO have it and take the view that someone's level 14 twink seriously doesn't need a rez like that.  (I almost wept when I saw someone who was level 13 screaming &quot;NEED REZ PLZ!!&quot; for 45 minutes.  In the Field of Bone.  Not a single cleric in zone.  Oy.  Talk about a difference between &quot;need&quot; and &quot;want&quot;.)<br>

I find this to be a very disturbing mental image . . . picturing an ogre trying to cram a startled-looking horse into a backpack.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Its part of the downside to not being a troll/ogre SK and part of being a paladin. You wanna do it then use a fucking shield.<br>

I can only hope they don't go live in that format.<br>
<br>
As a paladin I have to look at my &quot;new&quot; skills and say no thanks. The reason for it is that Paladins seem to get less skills then most other classes one of them being something that EVERY other class can buy with 9k. Summon horsie.<br>
<br>
Lay of Hands should have been complete heal from the beginning I agree. A 72 minute re-usable skill that sometimes only heals for 1000 points is pathetic. How about a new skill Verant called Fixed Lay of Hands. <br>
<br>
For all of you who dont play pallies if your target is out of range LoH is still used. And sometimes it's very hard to realise your tank or enchanter is out of range. How about lay of hands not working on a mob which can sometimes be accidentally targetted?<br>
<br>
How about lay hands that doesnt work on corpses because sometimes our enchanters die faster then we can fire LoH but a message such as &quot;Your comrade is already dead&quot; would be nice.<br>
<br>
Basically any sort of failure with LoH means we miss our cast for another 72 minutes. So Fixed Lay of Hands would be nice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Act of Valor. The ability to give all my remaining hitpoints to another person? Hahah so still not a complete heal for the target. I chose the paladin and role-played it well until role-playing all but died. I have given my life for other group members before and will continue to do so in the future but more often then not by luck and by amazing skill I've lived. This removes that possibility. <br>
<br>
I will never ever use Act of Valor. I played to be a noble hero skilled with the blade and with magic. I did not sign up to be walked over by people who expect me to lay down my life for another person who possibly wasn't paying attention. To all the paladins that will I commend you but I'm not being anybodys fool and I hope you're not too.<br>
<br>
<br>
Slay undead?? This is a joke right? Verant actually put this down as something they would think about putting into paladins post 51 as an inherent trait, but now they're backpedaling.<br>
<br>
Fearless - this isn't overbalancing, this is the way for a paladin to be the only one stood next to an uber mob till fear wears off. Can we say dead paladin? How about Inspire Courage which is what we asked for. The ability to make every member of the group fearless for a limited period of time?<br>
<br>
2h Bash - show me the logic in this. You can't bash anyone with a sword end of story. Don't get me wrong its nice but hardly in comparison to area effect taunt is it?<br>
<br>
Verant took these ideas from the class balancing discussions of which we got 2 of the 12 items that had been put forward. They were to be given to Paladins to balance them to the classes as they were. Not to be given to paladins once every other class had been given skills which would widen the gap.<br>
<br>
<br>
So I have a choice, level or skill...well anybody knows that at the level you get these you need every level you can get. The difference between levels is phenomenal so this is actually for level 60 characters then really, apart from one or two skills that are must haves i.e my one saviour Improved Stun and some other classes skills.<br>
<br>
I think all this will do is redefine which classes are the needed ones without bringing any balance. <br>
<br>
I pray this is a wind-up. <p><CENTER>
