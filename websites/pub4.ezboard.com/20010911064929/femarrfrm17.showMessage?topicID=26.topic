A man walks into a bar with an ostrich and a cat and sits at the bar.  The<br>
bartender walks over to them and says, &quot;What can I get for you?&quot;  The man<br>
says, &quot;I'll have a beer.&quot;  The ostrich says, &quot;I'll have a Coke,&quot; and the cat<br>
<br>
says, &quot;I'll have half a beer and I'm not buying.&quot;  The bartender says, &quot;OK,<br>
that will be $3.87&quot;  The man reaches into his pocket and brings out the<br>
exact<br>
change and pays the bill.<br>
<br>
 A few days later, the same group walks into the bar.  The bartender goes<br>
over to them and says, &quot;What'll you guys have?&quot;  The man says, &quot;I'll have a<br>
martini.&quot;  The ostrich says, &quot;I'll have a white wine,&quot; and the cat says,<br>
&quot;I'll have half a beer and I'm not buying.&quot;  The bartender gets them their<br>
drinks and says, &quot;That'll be $8.75.&quot;  The man reaches into his pocket and<br>
brings out the exact change and pays him.<br>
<br>
 A couple of days later the same group arrives back in the bar and the<br>
bartender approaches them and asks, &quot;So...what do you guys want today?&quot;  The<br>
<br>
man says, &quot;I'll have a scotch.&quot;  The ostrich says, &quot;I'll have a bourbon,&quot;<br>
and<br>
the cat says, &quot;I'll have half a beer and I'm not buying.&quot;  The bartender<br>
says, &quot;OK, that will be $9.53.&quot;  The man reaches into his pocket and brings<br>
out the exact change and pays him.<br>
<br>
 The bartender's curiosity has gotten the best of him at this point and he<br>
asks, &quot;Why is it that every time I tell you the amount you owe you always<br>
have the exact change in your pocket?&quot;<br>
<br>
 The man said, &quot;Well, it's like this.  I found a bottle with a genie in it<br>
and she granted me 3 wishes.  My first wish was that I always have the exact<br>
<br>
change in my pocket for anything I buy.&quot;  The bartender says, &quot;That's a<br>
great<br>
wish...better than asking for a million dollars...a million dollars would<br>
run<br>
out but exact change never will.<br>
 What were your other two wishes?&quot;  The man says, &quot;Well, that's where I<br>
screwed up.  I asked for a chick with long legs and a tight pussy.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
A magician was working on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. The<br>
audience would be different each week, so the magician allowed<br>
himself to do the same tricks over and over again.<br>
<br>
There was only one problem:  The captain's parrot saw the<br>
shows every week and began to understand what the magician did<br>
in every trick.  Once he understood that, he started shouting<br>
in the middle of the show.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look, it's not the same hat!&quot;  &quot;Look, he's hiding the flowers<br>
under the table!&quot; &quot;Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of<br>
Spades?&quot;<br>
<br>
The magician was furious but couldn't do anything, it was the<br>
captain's parrot after all.<br>
<br>
One day the ship had an accident and sank. The magician found<br>
himself on a piece of wood, in the middle of the ocean, and of<br>
course the parrot was by his side.<br>
<br>
They stared at each other with hate, but did not utter a<br>
word.  This went on for several days.<br>
<br>
After a week the parrot finally said, &quot;Okay, I give up.<br>
What'd you do with the boat?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
An extraordinarily handsome man decided he had the God-<br>
given responsibility to marry the perfect woman so they could<br>
produce children beyond comparison.<br>
<br>
With that as his mission he began searching for the perfect<br>
woman.  After a diligent, but fruitless, search up and down<br>
the east coast, he started to head west. Shortly thereafter he<br>
met a farmer who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters<br>
that positively took his breath away. So he explained his<br>
mission to the farmer, asking for permission to marry one of<br>
them.<br>
<br>
The farmer simply replied, &quot;They're all lookin' to get married,<br>
so you came to the right place. Look them over and select<br>
the one you want.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man dated the first daughter. The next day the farmer<br>
asked for the man's opinion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well&quot; said the man, &quot; She's just a weeeeee bit, not that you<br>
can hardly notice, but pigeon-toed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the<br>
other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter.<br>
<br>
The next day, the farmer again asked how things went.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; the man replied, &quot;She's just a weeeee bit, not that<br>
you can hardly tell, cross-eyed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to<br>
see if things might be better. So he did.<br>
<br>
The next morning the man rushed in exclaiming,  &quot;She's<br>
perfect, just perfect! She's the one I want to marry!&quot; So they<br>
were wed right away.<br>
<br>
Months later the baby was born. When the man visited<br>
nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most<br>
pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-<br>
law asking how such a thing could happen considering the<br>
parents.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; explained the farmer, &quot;She was just a weeeee bit, not<br>
that you could hardly tell, pregnant when you met her.&quot;<br>

There is this ship that goes out to sea and crashes.  6 people (1 woman and<br>
5 men) survive and use a safety raft to float  to a deserted island.<br>
  After spending several weeks on the island, they all begin to get really<br>
lonely, sexually deprived lonely. So they come to this agreement :<br>
each man will marry the one woman for a week.  So the first man has her for<br>
one week, then the second man has her  for the second week, and so on.<br>
 Everyone will now be getting sex and they all agree to it.<br>
 This goes on for five years and everyone is happy.  Each man gets sex<br>
every fifth week and the woman gets to have sex whenever she wants with a<br>
different man every week.<br>
 Well, a few weeks into the fifth year, the woman dies !!!!<br>
  The first week is pretty bad, the second week is still pretty bad,  the<br>
third week it's getting worse, the fourth week things are just bad, really<br>
bad, the fifth week it is just awful, it's getting too<br>
 bad, soooooo...on the sixth week...... (scroll down)<br>

A man walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a hundred year old brandy.<br>
The bartender pours him his drink, the man takes a sip and says, &quot;Ugh! This<br>
is only twenty-five years old!  I want a hundred year old brandy!&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender searches around, pulls out another bottle and pours the man his<br>
drink.  &quot;Ugh!&quot;, the man says.  &quot;This brandy's only fifty years old!  No, man!<br>
 Give me a hundred year old brandy!&quot;<br>
<br>
The bartender shakes his head, goes into the back room, pulls out a dusty<br>
bottle, pours the man his drink.  &quot;Mmmmm, Finally!  This is what I asked<br>
for!&quot;, the man exclaims as he savors the brandy.<br>
<br>
Just then, a drunk man who has been observing the scenario staggers up to the<br>
man with a glass.  &quot;Hey, man! Try this!&quot;, the drunk insists.  After some<br>
argument, to appease the drunk the man finally takes a sip.  He spews the<br>
liquid out of his mouth and yells, &quot;Yuck!! This tastes like urine!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah&quot;, responds the drunk, &quot;but how old am I?&quot;<br>
