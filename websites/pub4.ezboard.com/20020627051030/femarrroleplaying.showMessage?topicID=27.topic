Wow. It's been too long - about 5 or so months. Hopefully after my rl activities slow down to a crawl, I can feed my addiction and be a thorn in the side of goodness again. But, until then, let's bring back some memories. Anyone remember this? *winks at Arikel*<br>
<br>
IC:<br>
<br>
Drazhkahn looked around at the large band of Trolls, Teir-dal and Ogres around him. The members of the Cimmerii where here in force, along with a large contigent of members of the Shadow Guard, Black Widows, Pandemonium, and the most prized possessions of all - Setis and Arikel. Drazhkahn know what they were up against, they were outnumbered and far from the sanctity of Neriak. Drazhkahn grinned at the thought. How many times has he faced death? It mattered not, Innoruuk had cursed him long ago, to die in battle was but a brief dream. Back he would be, only stronger.<br>
Tzimisce and Solstaar erupted from the north, the Knights have gathered in force - apparently, there were one or two spies that have escaped with their tongues intact. Drazhkahn cursed himself and looked around, plans were being made, they were to split off into groups - spread the Knights out and slip between there lines. Hopefully, their precious cargo will arrive safely to the Third Gate in Neriak and then... *grins* they will be ours. Grim determination lined Drazhkahn's face. Ugdugy and Arikel were to go first - hoping to drag most of the Knights away from their posts. Mornak and his group, were to head west through the Rathe Mountains and around HighHold Pass. Drazhkahn looked at Cruelteez with concern. She was still very young and he felt a pull towards her since the first time they'd met. They were to be apart but he knew she will not be caught. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udrazhkahn.showPublicProfile>Drazhkahn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#E9D756>(4/8/00 5:06:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Setis's decision</span><hr size=1> Drazhkahn turned from her. Looking at the small force that remained, Solstaar, Setis, and Kaelamdar were all that remained, the rest; Morzinynin, Demura, Vaelle, Tzimisce, Krual, Kayla, Nallae, Tzylas, Kruk, Cybull and Cruelteez had spread out and were now running through the shadows of Innothule.<br>
Drazhkahn's group started their journey.<br>
&quot;We stick to the shadows.&quot; Drazhkahn told the group. As hungry for battle he was, now was not the time - all that mattered was to get the pieces of Arikel and Setis's soul to Neriak.<br>
&quot;We should not hide from the weak Knights. Let them cower before our power.&quot; Setis declared haughtily.<br>
&quot;Better to be safe then sorry.&quot; Solstaar commented.<br>
&quot;It is a mission of stealth we are on.&quot; Draz mentioned. &quot;When we reach the oasis, we hit the water. Stay close to the bottom so their scouts do not see us.&quot;<br>
They nodded in silent agreement as they made their way. Hours passed as they swam through the coastline, upon reaching the high stone walls of Freeport, the encountered their first sign of trouble - an outfit of Fists of the Five Winds and a couple of Knights of the Holy Storm.<br>
&quot;Setis, come to me and let us embrace.&quot; Chaya shouted.<br>
&quot;I'll embrace you alright!&quot; Setis yelled, his hand gripping the hilt of his blade.<br>
&quot;Touch him you will not.&quot; Drazhkahn said.<br>
&quot;You have always wanted to dance with me.&quot; Chaya commented. &quot;Now is your chance..&quot;<br>
&quot;You may not like the tune I dance to.&quot; Setis declared, brandishing his sword.<br>
Soon the night sky was filled with shouts and taunts from the shadows along the tunnel to the Commonlands.<br>
&quot;Death to the Light Bearers!&quot;<br>
&quot;Stand and fight me Arikel!&quot;<br>
&quot;Show them the strength of power Arikel!&quot;<br>
&quot;Show yourself then!&quot;<br>
&quot;No coward, and no fool either. Silence Bareba, my actions will speak for me soon enough.&quot;<br>
Drazhkahn saw his opportunity to sneak through while they were distracted. He grinned to himself. Fools, so easily distracted with a few meaningless words. Suddenly a scream ran through the night air - Morzinynin has fallen to the hands of Chaya. Moments later, the silence was broken again, Tzimisce. Gone, along with a piece to complete the ceremony. Drazhkahn had to get there now. Someone had to.<br>
Suddenly Setis stepped from the shadows.<br>
&quot;I may be the only one that can stop Chaya.&quot;<br>
&quot;We will leave you.&quot; Drazhkahn commented.<br>
&quot;You don't stand a chance.&quot; Kaelemdar said, shaking his head.<br>
&quot;Come let us go in haste.&quot; Solstaar said moving ahead of the group, forcing them to forget this foolishness.<br>
&quot;I will end her.&quot; Setis growled, hate burning in his eyes.<br>
&quot;Farewell, Setis.&quot; Kaelemdar said and quickly joined up with Solstaar.<br>
&quot;We will not wait for you.&quot; Drazhkahn said. Hopeless at it was to sway him from fighting, Drazhkahn didn't want to lose a member of his team, there were plenty more Knights to block their path.<br>
Turning his back to Setis, Drazhkahn ran to the tunnels.<br>
<br>

Surrounded she was by Knights and monks, desperately trying to cast anything to slow their advance. How Drazhkahn wanted to charge headfirst into the fray. His heart screamed with a fury.<br>
&quot;Unnoticed we are.&quot; Solstaar said. &quot;If we hurry they will not see us.&quot;<br>
Quickly, the three ran past the ensuing battle. Draz tried to block the cries of his love from his mind, disturbed him this did, he much rather enjoyed hearing it.<br>
<br>
***<br>
Titefeuille stood back watching the Knights pick apart the rag-tag band of Tier'dals. They had the battle won it was only a mat... what? From the corner of his eye he saw a small glit of metal from the shadows. Another band was trying to sneak through. Quickly the halfling alerted the others and ran after the second party. They were no match for the fleet-footed halfling and he easily reached the trailing teir-dal.<br>
<br>
***<br>
&quot;Fight me!&quot; Drazhkahn heard a voice from behind him. Spinning around he saw a small furry-footed man, waving his staff around menacingly.<br>
&quot;You must fight my bodyguards first.&quot; Drazhkahn retorted.<br>
&quot;Where are they?&quot;<br>
&quot;Right here.&quot; Kaelamdar said, stepping out from behind the small halfling as he cleaved the halfling's shoulderblade. Quickly Titefeuille recited the words as struck Kaelamdar with a lightning bolt, but the cut was deep and the sword's bite bit deep into his flesh. Soon, the halfling fell, his life's blood feeding the hungry earth. Running to his fallen comrade, Ndiyen stopped as he saw the three tier'dals.<br>
Again Kaelamdar stepped in front of the feir'dal to protect Drazhkahn and the stone the contained Arikel's soul.<br>
The two mighty foes clashed, blades flashing crimson and spells lighting up the dim tunnel passage.<br>
&quot;None can defeat my guards!&quot; Drazhkahn yelled as Ndiyen fell alongside Titefeuille.<br>
Quickly they ran to Nektulos, Kaelamdar lagging behind, a trail of blood marking the way they went.<br>
<br>
They arrived into the forest without incident. Drazhkahn sighed. They have made it this far without little incident. But what of the others? Draz had to get to Neriak and wait for the others.<br>
<br>

<br>
Drazhkahn's footsteps echoed through the dark halls inside neriak's third gate. He was safe. Placing the greater lightstone upon the altar of blood, the sound of a million agonizing screams could be heard as the lightstone cracks in two. He had completed his part of the mission. Arikel was theirs.<br>
<br>
The grin the spread across Drazhkahn's face was quickly wiped clean when he heard the shouts of the inner city guards. Invaders have dared enter the forest! Those foolish Knights, even in the most darkest of times, they still had hope that their 'friends' could be saed. Matter it did not, his assignment was completed, he was know free to send as many Knights as possible to the feet of Erollisi Marr.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the entrance to the forest, Drazhkahn smiled. All hell had broken lose. Knights and monks swarmed the forest in droves. Members of the Black Widows, Panemonium, Shadow Guard and the Cimmerii were joined by a couple of the forest's partol and were locked in a heated battle. Spells lit up the sky, making it appear as if it was the middle of the day.<br>
&quot;Foul Knights! Arikel is ours!&quot; Drazhkahn shouted.<br>
&quot;Drazhkahn!&quot; Aganerral yelled. &quot;I challenge you for the soul of brother Arikel!&quot;<br>
&quot;Matters it does not! Victory is ours this day!&quot;<br>
Suddenly, Setis and Breus erupted from the brush, locked in a struggle to the death. <br>
&quot;Wake yourself up.&quot; Breus said to Setis, who only snarled at his once good-friend.<br>
&quot;Slay him Setis! Spill his blood!&quot; Drazhkahn urged, trying to fuel Setis's fury.<br>
Suddenly Breus's backpack glowed as Setis's Inner Fire as Setis tries to land the final blow.<br>
&quot;Kill him!&quot; Drazhkahn yelled as Setis stood there hesitating for a second. But Drazhkahn's words were cut short. Thundarr stepped forth over the body of Krual. Enraged, Drazhkahn challenged the barbarian; he knew he was no match but he would not let Krual's death go unavenged.<br>
&quot;I must avenge my guild member's death.&quot; Drazhkahn said.<br>
Looking down at the tier-dal, Thundarr chuckled. &quot;Then you shall share the same fate.&quot;<br>
<br>
OOC: Long story short. I died. Being bound in Grobb and SOW-less, I didn't get the chance to see what happened with Setis and Breus. Also Laocoon, another one of our 'good guys gone bad' showed up and we all decided to go to the Arena - but that is another story! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzariel.showPublicProfile>Zariel</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>   <font color=#E9D756>(4/12/00 2:02:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Getting it together (very long)</span><hr size=1> OOC: after Arikel, his soul stolen by the Harvester, turned evil, Zariel had a little trouble coping.  This is sort of a &quot;Meantime, back at the monastery&quot; kind of post.<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
 Panting with exertion, Zariel lashed out again and again. She landed two punches  on her opponent, then a round kick, following it with her newly-learned (but impressive) Tiger Claw. &quot;Die!&quot; she panted. &quot;Die already!&quot; Her opponent leered back at her, laughing mockingly, not even sweating. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't mean that,&quot; he told her, his voice as smooth and teasing as his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;DIE! I hate you, I hate you! You betrayed me!&quot; she screamed back. Her blows were all over the place, and every one missed him. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't mean that, either, little one. Come to me now,&quot; he said. &quot;Come to my arms....&quot; He dodged her next few blows. Exhaustion was making her careless, but if  she stopped, he would have her. &quot;Come to me, stop fighting it. I love you more than anyone ever has...more than anyone ever will. And you love me, you always have.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; she screamed. &quot;I don't love you!&quot; It was all she could do to avoid his attacks, as he went on the offensive. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, you do, little one, Zarry, Sister of the Fist.&quot; His smiling face was a twisted  parody of love and caring. She knew something horrible lay behind his eyes. She looked away, could not meet his eyes, the eyes so similar to the ones she loved most  in the world. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't call me that! Any of that -- you aren't allowed!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't tell me what I can't do!&quot; his voice rose, and now he was angry. So angry.  &quot;Bad girl!&quot; No, she thought, no, that's wrong!  I'm good, I'm the good one! Her opponent continued to berate her.  &quot;You never stopped being weak! You never stopped misbehaving! You never learned control!  And now you will be punished! You dare to call yourself a monk? I laugh at you, I spit on you....&quot; His face twisted horribly as he spat what seemed like venom at her. It burned her skin where it touched her. She stumbled backwards, tripped over a root and fell. To her horror, she began to cry. She pulled herself to her feet and tried to run,<br>
but  her ankle hurt and she moved so slowly, as though running in water. And she could hear him behind her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look at you, you're like a scared little animal!&quot; he said, voice full of scorn. Then again, soft and enticing, &quot;Come to me, let me heal your wounds, little Zarry.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; she whimpered, but she was in his arms. &quot;No, I don't want you to! Leave me alone, leave me alone!&quot; He was crushing her, crushing her; her ribs began to ache.  &quot;Stop, you're hurting me...stop, please....&quot; Every breath was agony as she begged for her life. &quot;Please, stop, I beg you.&quot; She could feel her ribs begin to splinter. &quot;Stop!  Please! Please, stop!&quot; And with the last of her breath -- &quot;ARI! NOOOOOOO!&quot; <br>
<br>
And she awoke, shivering, crying, on her pallet on the floor of her cell, her room at the monastary. There was a knocking at the door, a frantic pounding. &quot;Zariel!  Zariel, let us in, or I'm coming in!&quot; <br>
<br>
She didn't have enough breath to say &quot;Come in,&quot; so she was glad for the threat.  She was still sobbing and screaming from the nightmare, although she knew it was but another dream. <br>
<br>
The door flew open. &quot;Zariel! What's wrong?&quot; It seemed half the monastary was there, wide awake. Brother Cyril was gazing at her in astonishment. Brother Kosta hurried into the room and dropped to his knees, putting a comforting an arm about her shoulders and helping her to sit up. &quot;It's all right, sister, it's all right. It was just a dream, just a bad dream,&quot; he assured her. <br>
<br>
As her sobs began to die away, Brother Aganerral said, his tone one of concern, &quot;Another one, Zarry?&quot;  Zariel nodded mutely. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand.&quot; Brother Cyril's new student, Devotee Chide, entered the room. &quot;What's wrong, sister?&quot; Chide too dropped to the floor, taking one of Zariel's hands. &quot;You're cold as ice,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;and you look like you've been fighting demons! This is all from a dream?&quot; She began to rub Zariel's hands betweenher own, as Zariel slumped, exhausted from her dream battle. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's your brother again, isn't it?&quot; asked Kosta, a worried look in his eye. &quot;I heard you scream his name.&quot; Zariel looked down at her lap in misery. <br>
<br>
&quot;I, too, heard you call out for Arikel,&quot; Cyril confirmed. He looked around, taking charge of the situation. &quot;Zariel's room isn't big enough for all of us. Why don't we adjourn to the kitchen? You could use some tea, sister, and so could I.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Me, too,&quot; chimed in Kosta and Chide simultaneously. Chide kept hold of Zariel's right hand as Kosta helped her to her feet. &quot;I love tea,&quot; he said. Zariel attempted to smile at them and failed miserably, bursting into tears again. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so weak, so weak,&quot; she repeated as they hurried her downstairs to the monastery's kitchen. &quot;I can't fight him anymore.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Poor Sister,&quot; said Aganerral kindly. &quot;You seem to wind up crying on the floor more than anyone I know!&quot; Zariel did manage a weak, teary smile at this good-natured remark. <br>
<br>
&quot;So I've observed myself,&quot; she said, voice wobbling. Four of the five monks sat down at the plain wooden kitchen table, while Kosta began to prepare the tea. Then, before she lost her nerve, Zariel told them about the dream, so like the others she'd had, every night since her brother had joined the evil Cimmerii. Her worried gaze took in Brother Cyril's equally troubled glance, Brother Aganerral's concerned expression, Brother Kosta's suspicious face, and Chide's open confusion. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ari...that's Arikel? Our Brother? The former guildleader?&quot; Chide asked the room in general. Everyone nodded. <br>
<br>
&quot;But he's Zariel's brother by birth, as well, and was her mentor here at the monastery, and since before the Fist of the Five Winds was formed,&quot; Cyril informed the Devotee.  He then looked thoughtfully at Zariel where she sat, knees to her chin, arms wrapped around herself. She looked very young, and he remembered she was just 17, only a year older than Chide. &quot;Zarry,&quot; he hazarded, &quot;have you thought about turning to Quellios about this?&quot; <br>
<br>
Zariel shook her head vehemently. &quot;No! The gods just confuse me. If they exist, they are cruel -- they took my parents and now my brother. I don't believe in them, anyway, and if I did I wouldn't ask them for help!&quot; Cyril sighed softly. He knew Quellios would help Zariel to attain a sense of calm, but he also respected her <br>
feelings. &quot;Brother Masakato understands,&quot; said Zariel stubbornly. Cyril only nodded, for he understood too. <br>
<br>
&quot;But listen, everyone,&quot; Zariel continued, a strange excitement in her voice. &quot;I know what I need to do. What these dreams are telling me.&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;I need to face Ari.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Sister, no!&quot; exclaimed Cyril. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; cried Kosta. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're not ready,&quot; stated Aganerral. <br>
<br>
And, &quot;Good idea,&quot; said Chide cheerfully. <br>
<br>
All faces turned to Chide. &quot;Good idea?&quot; they echoed. <br>
<br>
Chide nodded emphatically. &quot;You're really angry, Sister,&quot; she said, &quot;aren't you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Zariel. &quot;He betrayed me. I loved and trusted him my whole life, and he has hurt and abandoned me in return. He said he would never do that, he swore that to me again and again, ever since our parents died. But he lied. He left me and joined...the Cimmerii. He didn't have to! Setis didn't! Laocoon didn't!&quot; Zariel grew closer to hysterics with each sentence. Cyril opened his mouth to explain again, how it wasn't Arikel's fault, how the Cimerii had corrupted and stolen him. But he caught Kosta shooting him a &quot;Not now, Brother, not now,&quot; look, and remained quiet. <br>
<br>
Aganerral, meanwhile, was nodding his head. &quot;I think I see what you're saying, Chide,&quot; he said to the young woman. He got up to help Kosta bring over the mugs of hot tea. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I know about anger, and I bet she can use it,&quot; Chide explained. &quot;You aren't ready to fight him, but you do need to face him and force him to explain himself, right?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Right,&quot; Zariel affirmed. <br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't help to tell you how it wasn't his fault; you're still going to feel like it was, right?&quot; asked Chide. Zariel nodded as she took a sip of tea. &quot;What I say is, the best defense is a good offence! It might be one of us next...how can we stop them? But you can't defeat Arikel, Zarry, and no matter what he's done to you, you still love him.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No, I --&quot; Zariel began to disagree. <br>
<br>
&quot;Zarry,&quot; said the other four together, obviously not believing her. <br>
<br>
&quot;All right, I do still love him,&quot; Zariel admitted grudgingly. &quot;A lot. But I'm also angry enough to die!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, don't die,&quot; advised Kosta gently. &quot;It's not good for the constitution.&quot; Everyone smiled at that; Aganerral even laughed. &quot;But I think I see where Chide's going. You need to face him -- and find out if there's a way to save him. If there's any of 'Ari' left in there, or if he's all 'Evil Arikel' now.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I think so,&quot; Zariel agreed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Cyril, &quot;I think it's a bad idea. Please, Chide, Brother Aganerral, Brother Kosta, don't encourage her!&quot; He turned to face Zariel, concern on his face. &quot;Zarry, I loved your brother too. He was my dearest companion for a long time. But he has changed so much...I don't think you should face him under any circumstances.  What  he has become is not his fault, but he will not spare you -- or your feelings.&quot;  Cyril winced in remembered pain. <br>
<br>
&quot;I, too, am against it, Brother Cyril,&quot; Kosta said. &quot;But you seem determined, Sister.  If you must face him, you must face him.... You're going to need help, though.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; Zariel said. &quot;He's still got a lot of power over me. I'd rather die than become evil, but I don't know if he'd give me the choice. But what kind of help is there?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Aganerral, &quot;there's us. We are your family too, you know.&quot; He smiled down at the grateful look on Zariel's face; she was nearly crying again. &quot;And we'll just have to make sure he doesn't get the chance! Now come on,&quot; said the order-driven Justicar. &quot;Let's get to work on a plan!&quot; <br>
<br>
There was a slight frown on Cyril's face as he absent-mindedly put a brotherly arm around Zariel's shoulders. Chide looked up and winked at the older girl; Zariel blushed.   As he was listening intently to Aganerral, Cyril failed to notice the two girls' exchange. <br>
<br>
The monks bent their heads towards Aganerral as he began to outline a plan, and even Cyril had to smile. Zariel realized she probably wouldn't have to fight Arikel, and her shoulders sagged with relief. Chide nodded intently, occaisonally making noises of agreement. Kosta was silent until Aganerral was finished, only then adding a few ideas of his own. Finally, all of those present were satisfied. <br>
<br>
&quot;Brother Aganerral, you're brilliant,&quot; said Zariel. &quot;What a plan!&quot; The five monks smiled at each other. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think,&quot; said Cyril, &quot;that I will have to call a guild meeting. And soon.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=27.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=27.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=27.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrfrm20">Crafter's Hideout<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script -->
