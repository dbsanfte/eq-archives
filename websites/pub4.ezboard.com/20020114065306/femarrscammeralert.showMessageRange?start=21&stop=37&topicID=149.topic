<br>
And as for the does it make it less wrong since others do it to? No, but it makes it the normal actions for that zone. If i was in a diffrent zone i would probabally do what the majority of the players in that zone did, in lguk 90% of the people try to get all the loow they can, and since I dont mind getting loot I tried to get all i could also. If i had been in a zone or group that was doing ngb or in a zone where people normally just took 1 item and were happy with it, I'd do that and not complain about it. I mainly hunt in areas for exp, but if there is loot available and the norm for that area is to be a loot whore, I guess greed takes over and I try to do it too.<br>
<br>
Mainly my intention in trying to get 2 was to sell my first so I could buy some better equip and then use the 2nd for my alt.<br>
<br>
But anyway, no because everyone else does it doesnt defend me trying to get 2.<br>
<br>
But being loot whorish in a zone where most of the other people are also, is completely diffrent then saying what i did was scamming. <p><br><font color=black>Krenuix Formshifter</font>

<br>
What you're saying is that loot whoring isn't scamming. I'm not sure so many would agree with you on that one and I also beleive that there a lot pf people taking notice on this one for when you reach the NBG zones. How can people trust you knowing you may have won the item you are claiming need on last week but handed it to an alt?<br>
<br>
What your saying is that your a loot whore but thats normal for guk. Well good luck on getting groups from anyone who hunts in Guk and reads this thread then. Quite simply what you did is in the eyes of a lot of people wrong and the fact that other people do it has no bearing on it.<br>
<br>
Nuzum,<br>
<br>
Im going to assume from the fact that Kerrol hasn't posted in this thread that you were talking to me in your last post. The game isn't called Evercamp. Some camps are excessively long and were designed to be so by Verant to keep the items valuable. But it's people whoring loot that make camps seem to long and unprofitable. I don't threaten you when I say watch what you post because people are reading this thread who won't take lightly to you advocating the actions. I honestly do not mean to be nasty when I say that. The fact that L Guk isn't NBG is irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Sol B isn't NBG either but it doesn't stop good people from bowing out on RMBs when the item's needed. I was in a group a few weeks ago where everyone bowed out of a roll on a book of obulous because the cleric was clearly going to use it. It wasn't NBG either, it was just the right thing to do. <p><HTML><CENTER>

<br>
I just realized something here, lets say some other caster in the group had won the Fbss when i won it. This is the series of events that would have happened.<br>
<br>
1.They rolled on a peice of equipment they had no intention of using, only to sell.(or possibly to give to a twink)<br>
2.They win an item, probabally stick with the group till they have to log or the group splits.<br>
3.Later or the next day they head to Ec or post something on this board saying they want to sell an fbss.<br>
4.They either sell it or bank it<br>
5.If not sold they go back to guk and dont roll on it, if sold they make the cash from the first one then roll on any others that drop when they see them.<br>
<br>
This is what i did(minus the getting scammed)<br>
<br>
1.Rolled on a peice of equip i planed to sell<br>
2.Won, stuck with the group for about 2 more hours till i had to log and the group split<br>
3.Next day i headed to Ec and spent about 1/2 an hour maybe 45 minutes trying to sell it.<br>
4.No luck selling it, so i had the, as i thought it then, good idea to transfer it to an alt that i had around that area so i could sell while hunting as it, and be able to roll on any that dropped that day<br>
5.Went back to guk, tried to get into group, all the groups had enchies so i didnt. But if i had gotten in a group, and the fbss dropped i would have rolled on it.<br>
<br>
Yes what i did was slightly more greedy then the average person who would have waited till they sold it to try to get a new one. But when looking at what i did compared to basically any other caster who won, all i did was transfer the item to an alt rather then wait till it was sold so i could try to roll on others. Really, i think that just sounds a lot more greedy then it was. If i hadnt gotten scammed and this was some random posting, and instead of transfering it to an alt i had sold it. would anyone be saying i was a scammer or greedy loot whore? <br>
<br>
In guk nothing is NBG,or at least nothing i have seen, so if a caster wins they basically do what I have shown in that list, maybe giving it to an alt or giving it/selling it for a major discount to friends/guildies. I have <i>Never</i> seen a caster say "Count me out of this roll, i just won one the other day", when an fbss droped, And since everyone always says casters always win and are greedy and keep melees from winning, im assuming casters that have been in groups i have been in, have won one before.<br>
<br>
Yes, i realize i was being more greedy then i intented to be, but realistically, if i had sold it the exact same outcome would have been producded(minus me getting scammed) but i wouldnt be a loot whore?<br>
<br>
And, i would never claim nbg transfer the item to an alt and try to reroll. I have no way to back that up, and since pretty much all you know of me is from these posts you probabally wont believe that. Claiming Nbg and transfering an item to an alt then claiming nbg again is scamming, by abusing nbg. Winning an item in a roll all of the group was included in, transfering it to an alt because you couldnt sell it and intend to sell it as that alt, and going back and wanting to roll on more is not scamming, allthough I now realize it sounds extremly greedy.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah and one other thing, the reason i transfered initially wasnt to reroll, but once I realized it i thought it was another reason it was a great idea. The initial reason was that i wanted to go back to guk and get exp but i also didnt want to run back to ec trying to sell it, and my alt hunts around that area so i figured i could sell it as him. Wasnt untill i was waiting around to do the transfer that i realized that good point.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah and im guessing someone will say that reason is BS and if it was the real reason why didnt i put it there originally. The post i made and copy and pasted to make this post was made around a week after the incedent and my memory isnt great. <p><br><font color=black>Krenuix Formshifter</font>

But every freaking person in this game knows that guk is where you can make your first decent money, so it's farmed. Now I know that some people chose to live the honorable life, and not to roll on items they do not need. I do the same. Other people use items they do not need in order to get items they do need. It's a choice that everyone has to make for themselves. It's not in good taste to harass the people that don't play the same as you for the sole reason that they don't play the same as you do.

Usually a melee heavy group might TRY to go NBG on fbss but usually Cleric or Enchanter will cry open roll and blackmail the group leader by threatening to leave the group.<br>
<br>
Had that happen once group was split between open roll which chanter demanded and NBG which i was hoping for.<br>
Leader said me and chanter roll whomever gets highest decides the loot rule for the afternoon.<br>

I won chanter said ok guys see ya and was gonna gate out.<br>

Don't know WHY everyone thinks they need a chanter/cleric at frenzy.<br>
<br>
I've been there with a necro or bard doing crowd control and a PALADIN handling the heals we did FINE.<br>
<br>
Poetic justice is seeing that Enchanter who demanded a roll on a FBSS cry when a Naggy Raid leader says MELEE ONLY on the COF hehe.<br>
<br>
Chanter: but..but. it's a 120k item.<br>
Raid leader: The melees need it you don't.<br>
Chanter: It's ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND PLAT!!!<br>

Too much melee gear compared to caster gear for 1 thing. Im sure i'll get flamed for this so here is an alternate to NBG that my friend came up with: if its class or type(melee or caster) specific then they can have it, they just have to give up what the item they are upgrading to the group so they can roll on it. This way the person that needs it and can use it, will get the item; but the rest of the group have a shot of getting something for their trouble also. Problem solved. Everyone can relax and play the game now.<br>
