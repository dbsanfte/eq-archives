<br>
Is the Pledge of Allegiance constitutional.<br>
<br>
I don't think it is and I've tried to demonstrate why I think it's not within the framework of our constitution.  Maybe I was using the term &quot;equality&quot; incorrectly, in this case I was specifically referring to equality of religious beliefs which is a very important principle of our country.  Arguments for free public housing, welfare etc, are interesting but they are separate from this argument.<br>
<br>
Of course, I have my own biases, I'm an atheist, I'm not the bit religious which makes it hard for me to understand why people get so bent out of shape about other people's religions in the first place.  I would never hate someone based solely on the God they worship, because I honestly don't care, but I know others do.  People hate other people for their religion all the time and the government should not serve to isolate or divide the country on the basis of religion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, little Johnny didn't say &quot;under God&quot; during the Pledge of Allegiance! You don't believe in God, Johnny, you worship Allah or something?  I bet your daddy blew up the World Trade Center!&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course, that example is inflammatory hyperbole, but it still serves to illustrate the dangers of setting citizens apart in a Pledge that's only supposed to bring us together.  <br>
<br>
The founders of the country worked pretty hard to set up a government where everyone would be free of religious bias and yet religion is now continually encroaching on government, either by those endorsing prayer in school or additions to the Pledge of Allegiance like &quot;under God.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hey, I love this country, the fact that people can freely argue and debate and bring lawsuits about the Pledge of Allegiance, it's a beautiful thing.<br>

I don't think the First Amendment demands absolute silence regarding all things religious.  I don't think words equate with belief, and it is &quot;belief&quot; that the Freedom OF Religion clauses address.<br>
<br>
I agree that the arguments of Dubya and the Right are contrary to historical records, but their conclusion is ultimately correct (even if the means they arrived there is specious).<br>
<br>
I don't think we can or should make all of life politically correct and stigma free.  If hearing someone say &quot;god&quot; or &quot;God&quot; is challenging for someone, then they've got a problem, not the person saying the words.<br>
<br>
I think it is wrong to force anyone to take or state the Pledge, but simply hearing it is not a recognizeable damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uathao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>athao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#E9D756>(6/28/02 10:24:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3442.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Pledge was written to SELL FLAGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> Lots of you are missing 2 points.<br>
<br>
The first and main issue I brought up was: The Pledge was written to SELL FLAGS...that is what started this thread.  It was not created by our founding fathers, it was not patrotic (although that is how they sold it), and it had no religious reference in it when created.  It was just a damn sales agenda forced on our public school system by sneaky lobying.  Yay capatilism!  We sold 10,000 flags in one fell swoop haha....<br>
<br>
Second: The religion was inserted in it by the government not that long ago specifically to represent a christian god that our country supposedly lives 'under'.  Any of you who say otherwise did not read any of the history presented in the links provided by me in the very first post or in many of the other posts people have provided since.<br>
<br>
Or government is not supposed to take sides on religion, ever.  You can practice and belive whatever religion/mythology you want to, even as a majority, but the government should still not be sided with you, or me, or anyone.  They are supposed to be the non-biased group to represent all the biased groups so we can live together in unity and equality and freedom.  This is what seperation of church and state is all about.  Sadly, IMO, the govermental body elected to represent us and make decisions about our laws, infrastructure, society is a majority of people who don't understand this.  They believe, like they have been taught, that their religion is right, others are wrong, and anyone who does not believe is also wrong (ie going to hell) or misled..silly non-believers they think.  Therefore there is nothing wrong, in their mind, with having their form of religion a part of everyday life (on our money, in their speaches, in the pledge, in our patrotic songs, wherever).<br>

What good is a Pledge of Allegiance that doesn't include all American citizens?<br>
<br>
Are you saying that if the words were &quot;under Allah&quot; you would have no problems with that and would just omit the words during the Pledge or would you feel left out that the Pledge of Allegiance to your country goes out of its way to honor religious beliefs other than your own?<br>
<br>
It's a shame, the author of the Pledge wrote a beautiful, emotionally stirring work that sought to include EVERYONE, and now it doesn't.  If the word &quot;under God&quot; were removed, the original intent would be preserved and it would truly be a Pledge that any American could freely and joyfully state and not feel excluded.<br>
<br>
It's not so much a matter of just &quot;don't say it&quot; because, of course that option exsists.  Atheists swearing in a court of law don't swear on the bible.  It's a matter of saying, all Americal citizens observe the same religious freedoms, all are equal and worthy before the US government.  Not, sure people can worship freely, but hey, we're a Christian country if you don't like it, get out. <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/gloriana.html"><img src="http://fyd.fuxored.net/glorymedium.jpg" border="0"></a><p>

Agnostic takes no stance on the existance or non-existance of a higher power, basically believing that you are not pretentious(sp?) enough to say you know what is going on. That is agnostic. Thus you wouldn't care about saying it.<br>

Good definition of agnostic and atheist, however not of my motivation. I think it's more disrespectful, as a non-christian, to participate in christian prayers and rites than it would be to just go along and participate. Of course, there are no black and white in this. Saying &quot;under God&quot; in some sort of pledge would be less hypocritical than receiving sacrament, but I'd still feel a bit uncomfortable doing it.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I just remembered something I wanted to say earlier: Isn't it true that one of the proper and legal ways of destroying an american flag is to burn it? :-)<br>
<br>
Ah yes, Federal Flag Code, Title 36, of the U.S. Code, paragraphs 176. Here are some interesting subsections:<br>
<br>
(i) &quot;The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.&quot;<br>
<br>
(j) &quot;No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
(k) &quot;The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm quite sure that (i) and (j) are violated a LOT...:-)<br>

How is the Pledge unconstitutional?<br>
I just do not see where it goes against your rights of being an American.<br>
It is a pledge to a flag, you can pledge to the flag, or you can choose not to pledge,<br>
That is your right of being an American. <br>
Just because the &quot;under god&quot; is in the pledge does not in anyway make it religious, therefore it is not state and church.<br>
<br>
Example, back in the day, you would have to make a pledge to the king to follow him, if you didn't like that king then you wouldn't make that pledge. <br>
Now with that pledge not being made, for religious or political beliefs, it is a pledge that you agree to follow and serve this king.<br>
<br>
BTW people usually who didn't make that pledge back in the day, where usually killed.<br>

For if the Pledge is 'un-constitutional' due the the words &quot;..under god..&quot;<br>

Then so must be the national anthem.<br>
now we must exclude this from ball games, from the olympics, from celebrations involving america..which BTW, I hope you dont step outside on the 4th..heaven forbid you might hear the pledge being recited by a bunch of 5th graders. <br>
Ask any of those 5th graders what they just said, doubtful you will find any that reply &quot;a way for the government to push its christian agenda onto the american public&quot; or &quot; it was an advertisement scheme to promote the sale of our national flag&quot;<br>

<br>
The court stated that both the 1954 law and a California school district policy requiring teachers to lead children in the pledge violate the First Amendment prohibition against the establishment of a state religion.<br>
<br>
According to one of the judges: &quot;although students cannot be forced to participate in recitation of the pledge, the school district is nonetheless conveying a message of state endorsement of a religious belief when it requires public school teachers to recite, and lead the recitation of, the current form of the pledge.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ``A profession that we are a nation `under God' is identical ... to a profession that we are a nation `under Jesus,' a nation `under Vishnu,' a nation `under Zeus,' or a nation `under no god,' because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion,'' Judge Alfred Goodwin, an appointee of President Nixon currently serving as a semiretired senior judge, wrote for the three-judge panel. Goodwin was joined by Stephen Reinhardt, an appointee of President Carter. <br>
<br>
The appeals court said that when President Eisenhower signed the legislation inserting ``under God'' after the words ``one nation,'' he declared, ``Millions of our schoolchildren will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty.''<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It was the Eisenhower's belief that children should proclaim their dedication to our nation and to the Almighty, but that doesn't make it constitutional.<br>
<br>
I fully expect the court's ruling to be overturned, but I do think it was interesting.<br>
<br>
Darue, I agree with you, while the idea of yanking the term God out of national songs, off our currency, out of oaths, etc. is appealing to me, it would be a nightmare and I doubt it would ever happen.<br>

Athao, you made a post a while back about our religions of today become myths like ancient greek religions.  I think that will happen, if humans live that long.  Actually I think it is already starting to happen.  Anyone else think that this debate came about because more and more of our (the US) population are becoming non-christian?<br>

<br>
-The Declaration of Independance-<br>
<br>
&quot;...the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...&quot;<br>
<br>
I was actually tested on the memorization of the above statements, how is that different from saying the Pledge of Allegiance?  An evil history teacher forced me to memorize and recite the Declaration of Independance in front of the other students, with its statements of &quot;God&quot; and &quot;their Creator&quot;... <br>
<br>
Is the court itself now in violation of the law? The Supreme Court opens every session with &quot;God save this honorable court&quot;<br>
<br>
Marines, (Note U.S. Marines, not you Royal folks)...we're in violation when we recite the Marine Creed...<br>
<br>
&quot;This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.<br>
...<br>
Before God, I swear this creed.<br>
My rifle and myself are the defenders of my country.<br>
We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.<br>
So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Marine Hymn mentions heaven, not God per say but the reference is still there.<br>
<br>
(just a quick note...Drill Instructors usually don't give you much of a choice when you're ordered to say the Marine Creed or sing the Marine Hymn and since a D.I. is a goverment employee, could this be taken as a statement of State sponsored religion?  ...actually, now that I think about it, putting a list together of rights that were NOT violated by the D.I.s might be easier...that extreme punishment thing...right out the window, several times...right to free speech...out the window bout the same time as the others...making me say God, those inhuman monsters...)<br>
<br>
Navy...I looked up the Sailor's Creed and found some silly thing about loving your swabs (mop) and being the janitor of the world...which fits the Navy, just don't think i can use that here...<br>
<br>
So...how far are we going to take this? When is enough enough? I personally dont care to learn a new version of the Star Spangled Banner or America the Beautiful and I like the Marine Hymn and Creed just as they are.<br>
<br>
I also guess that I interpret Serparation of Church and State oddly, I have always understood it to mean that the Church did not answer and could not be controlled by the elected Government and vice versa. I don't understand how &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, &quot;God save this honorable court&quot; and &quot;Under God&quot; violate the 1st amendment as these are not laws, just statements. (Course, my interpretation may be why I'm not a Supreme Court Justice....)<br>
<br>
One last comment, and Im sure this will not go over well, the folks saying &quot;love it or leave it&quot; need to open your minds and learn. It is our duty as citizens to question the government and its decisions.  I will not blindly follow the decisions that go against my up bringing.  <br>
<br>
We will never agree 100 percent on the way our country is run and we should always feel comfortable enough to question those decisions that are made, but I do think there are other issues that need more of our and the court's attention than &quot;Under God&quot;.<br>

I cant think of ANY attitude that would define your term &quot;bad American&quot; than yours. The fact that this country has done shitty things doesnt have ANYTHING to do with what happens in our country. You drag our country down by even comparing us with them. We are Americans. That used to mean we were better than all of them so comparing us to them is an insult to us. There is nothing American about your closed minded jingoist attitude.

The words &quot;under God&quot; are too insignificant for either side to get this worked up over, which is why it took so long to find someone petty enough to try to get it removed. (There may have been other lawsuits.) I don't think the words really belong, I don't care much either way, and I don't think this will be the straw that destroys the American culture back. I don't think the other examples of religion in government excuse anything, in the same way that other speeders don't protect you from a ticket. They exist because a lot of politicians are either very religious or wanted to appear so (religious voters seem to remember being slighted better). Also, when was the last time you heard the Star Spangled Banner sung in full, with religious reference, not that it would matter for NON-GOVERNMENTAL situations?<br>

  Pray all you want, in your nationalistic pledge or not, but remember that a major ideal of the USA is tolerance. What are you losing if it's taken out? Can we replace it with &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;? Finally, who wants some ice cream?<br>

Are you questioning my grammer?  I know it sucks, but not that much.<br>
And as far as the &quot;we are right, you are wrong, welcome to hell&quot; that is not a quote.  It is a gross oversimplification.  As far as I can tell, if you don't believe/worship you don't get the good afterlife you get the bad one.  Correct me if I'm wrong but that holds for most major religions.  However, they usually also have 'oops, my bad' clauses where you can join and/or repent for wrong doing at any time and still get the 'good' afterlife <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...you know, give me 12 hail marys and you gtg, that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter what you/I believe or don't believe, someone else believes something different just as strongly as you/I, and also has no hard/real evidence to back up their belief.  We are all going to someone elses hell I guess <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and you can't prove otherwise even with one million billion quotes...<br>

<br>
Please show me where this rule is written, or did you just think it sounded good and supported your position?<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that the meaning of &quot;God&quot; depends on the person using the term. To a Moslem it means Allah, to a Jew it means Yahweh, to Gordon Gekko it means the almighty dollar. No matter where the person is standing, their use of the word determines what it means when they say it. In this case, we have all been regaled with the story of what the inclusion of this word means. We can kid ourselves by thinking we each mean something different when we say it but it is very clear that we are saying it as something institutional, not a personal affirmation or vow. Frankly I have no personal problem with the words being in there, even if in a philosophical and analytical sense what it means bothers me a little. <br>
Now on to the previous poster. What DOES bother me is closed minded, hateful, jingoistic people thinking America is THEIRS and not OURS. There is nothing more UN American than those who would rob others of their rights under the institutions of this country. Anyone who thinks or states that I cannot recognize the flaws of this country, its leaders and its institutions and work to change or improve them is the antithesis of America. I am not a left wing whacko. I am a long time Republican. I am active in the governmental process. I am very familiar with the evils done in the name of this country. I am also familiar witht he evils done in the name of Christianity. Nothing the Nazis or Taliban or Joe Stalin did exceeds the atrocities done in the name of Jesus Christ. But recognizing the flaws of Christianity or wrongs done its name does not make one unChristian. The same goes for America. The fact that it is better than Societ Russia does not make it perfect. The fact that I recognize its flaws does not make this YOUR country and not MINE.<br>
<br>
I cannot help wondering how many of the people who daily pledge allegiance to the flag rip it to shreds tied to their car's aerials, thinking all the time that this makes them a &quot;good American&quot;.  Tell me, is the 50% of the country that doesnt vote each year made up of &quot;good Americans&quot;? If not, can their &quot;good American&quot; status be regained by telling other people to leave the country? by destroying the American flag which they pledged allegiance to at 70MPH on our nations highways? Considering that your post exhibits what I would call the MOST UN American of sentiments, I would be interested to hear what you define as a &quot;good American&quot;.<br>

While I've decided to keep my mouth out of this argument; (it doesn't matter enough to me to pursue it, and I think both sides are being rather eloquent, and I'd much rather just sit back and enjoy) but that argument is entirely wrong. <br>
<br>
She should stop there [religion] because that's her argument. She never once said everyone should be equal in America.
