I just know you made MS miserable during your last few months in it and people were glad to see you go.  the one time you got off your ass, you did a piss poor job at pulling a basic ass part of the zone.  you make the judgement on your skills cuz I saw none at all.<br>
<br>
you couldnt handle that MS was in a learning curve and jumped ship like most bitches do.<br>
<br>
I ask hothgar a few questions on vindi pull, big deal, the monks and I figured out about 10 different and easier ways to pull him after that.  I have no shame is asking someone simple questions cuz unlike you I can really care less about having a ego in a videogame.  if people asked me a pull I would let them know in a heartbeat cuz who gives a flying fuck, its a videogame, have fun.  if you are gonna have a ego then have a ego about something worth while.<br>
<br>
Before I joined MS, I had little to no time in pulling SoV.  Once I became full member and before popplo(when he is online which is 100%, nobody else will get a chance to pull, popplo is the best puller EVER and he loved to pull, so not much room to help) came back I got to pull alot.  I loved pulling and learned to do it fast, not cuz Im good but because this shit is elementry.  EQ IS EASY, so please, save your shit for people who also need their frail ego stroked.  maybe start a EQ support group for ex-washed up uber players who still need to feel they are good at something.<br>

I'll have to agree with Lumi on this. I believe i was in fear that night as well, and Caliss &quot;did&quot; have some context to get angry. However, the means he went about it were completely wrong.<br>

Kor guildremoved Zol and Silac because they were fighting in /gu which is the basic response to bickering in /gu. Hell, Kor even guildremoved me once for fighting in /gu with Silac. So Zol please don't take specific offense at him removing you, it's always been how interguild bitching in /gu has been handled. I can't say Zol was right in calling anyone a bitch in /gu but he had a right to be mad since she did have him on ignore, and has a few other guildmembers on ignore. I'm sure the real question then is why did she have him on ignore ... but let's not start that circle jerk again. Either way I gotta go with Ven on this ... you shouldn't have any guildmembers on ignore. Why can't you just &quot;ignore&quot; their text that bothers you on your own? Someone asking for a port/buff/heal is the exact reason you shouldn't ever put anyone on ignore. /shrug Just how I see it I guess.<br>
<br>
Zol, I love the hell outta you but please understand this wasn't a you vs. them issue. Like I said anyone who bickers in /gu gets removed until they calm down and resolve their issues privately. It's just a way to keep up guild morale and such. However justified you feel you are, understand you weren't removed for what you said specifically or who it was said about but simply that you said it in /gu. And yes ... had you called me a bitch and I responded in /gu he would have removed us both.<br>

Or Better yet, I can beat you up!, Or My girlfriend is better looking then yours. I can piss further then you, My dick is bigger, I can beat you in so and so sports. But since this is a video game forum I will stick to that.<br>
<br>
Do I think that I had/have skills in this game for pulling and figuring the good ways to get it done. Yes.<br>
<br>
Do I think that Kanibaal did not at the time? Yes<br>
<br>
Does that mean that he will not learn them over some time and trial and error? Nah<br>
<br>
He will be able to out pull me in SoL because I will never be there. =D<br>
<br>
I just jumped on his case because I thought he was coming onto a rant/flame that he had no bussiness being in what so ever. Seeing that he was not on MS when Caliss removed. I don't think he has a say in shit. He must of thought that I was here to protect my buddy Caliss because I maybe know him in real life? Nah. I happen to know him sure. But I also consider Yarnorbs a good buddy of mine. (Yarny! Email! Ragazragaz@hotmail.com)<br>
<br>
As for making my last few months in MS a living hell or some shit. I doubt that. I mean sure some people got rubbed the wrong way but why should I care. When I left I could have took alot of people with me. But I told them to stay and play since I was not going to play much afterwards.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>you couldnt handle that MS was in a learning curve and jumped ship like most bitches do.</font><br>
<br>
You really must be joking here. I left because of my own things. You should be happy I did not veto you from getting in the guild. I was in, I could have done it. But since Lumi started in with Sture can't do this I am going to veto him. I just let you in because I was on the way out and Sture wanted to be in a powerfull guild. I did not jump ship anyhow. I just got off at the docks and went onto a bigger boat. Magister was great to me. They knew I was in it for the fun. Loot? Nah. Big Fat raids killing uber shit? Yeah.<br>

Gee and people wonder why Da`Kor don't want to be associated with this bunch. Sad part is that they get back in, in my opinion if someone was so offensive in Affliction that  an officer was forced to remove them... well I guess they can join Magister.<br>

<br>
There is a difference between a guild of people that rationaly argue (most of the time =P) and morons like zolmaz that apparently bring up shitstorms in guildchat (and others from what it sounds like).  Don't compare them.<br>
<br>
I doubt you know anything about the old Da`Kor, so don't make bad comments like you know what you are talking about.<br>

I could seriously give two shits about that, also I wasnt there and wouldnt make myself look like a idiot and comment on it.  <br>
<br>
read it again, you will see I was calling his ass out on being such a pussy to post about a very touchy situation between jubei and koolleen.  he used it to egg jubei on into a flame and to further damage the situation on jubei's side but forgetting koolleen is still there and it is hurting her too.  then he uses &quot;oh its too personal and oh its a guildie gag order&quot; excuse to not have to look like a idiot who feels he knows more about the situation then jubei does.  if he really cared about koolleen, then he would not have said anything at all, even if it was the biggest breaking statement he could ever make to jubei.<br>
<br>
yeah, this is a EQ forum, Im sorry to hear you feel your skills are something you feel you need to brag about.  maybe you can put it on your resume?<br>
<br>
funny how I was told to hang on and not worry about the situation of your veto on me.  that if you kept acting(lootwhore, negative, bitchy) like you did they would just boot you and let me join.  you were expendable, just like anyone in the guild. so stop making yourself look so tough, MS after you left became a better guild, bad attitudes do alot to people who play a game for fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uwalterscott.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walterscott</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 1117<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/29/01 9:29:58 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/glewisjr1/Weim.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Silac, You just had to open your F-Mouth again.</span><hr size=1> ding, ding, ding... 200th post.<br>
