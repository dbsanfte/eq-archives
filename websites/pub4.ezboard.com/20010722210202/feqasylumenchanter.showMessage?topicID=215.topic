As you younger enchanters are growing up, do not forget to use charm in your groups. A lot of enchanters use it some while soloing and never use it in group situations. Practice using it all the time. Once you hit 60, you will use it quite a bit more then mesmerize to do crowd control. During raids, I am called upon a lot to charm a particular mob and send it upon the boss mob. You can not believe the damage output of a hasted Wyvern in Western wastes, or a myconid at the spore king camp, or a juggernaut during a juggernaut raid, etc, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
Here are some tips on helping with charmed mobs:<br>
<br>
1) Charm the least powerful mob you can find. Never charm the highest level mob in a pull. Always try and get a lower level one. It will help with charm duration. Even the least powerful mob will usually do at least the damage output of your entire group during a fight.<br>
<br>
2) Keep Beserker Str and Rune up at all times. Charm's biggest drawback is of course its unpredictability. Charm will break on you at the least oppertune time. It is Murphy's law. Its going to happen. So be prepared. With Bedlam/Rune V you can usually channel a new charm through a mob beating on you. This is harder at lower levels but once you get boltron's it becomes much easier because the casting time is low.<br>
<br>
3) Keep an Alure wand handy. You know, the ones from the Plane of Fear with 3 charges of Allure. If all else fails and you cant regain control of a mob, drop a charge of allure on him. It is instacast and will save your butt.<br>
<br>
4) Keep root memmed. Root is one of the easiest spells to channel through a mob beating on you. If you just cant regain control, throw down a root on your mob and back away.<br>
<br>
5) Have your pet keys hot keyed. Now that the hot key pads have 10 keys on them instead of 6, you can at least afford to have /pet attack and /pet back off on the number 1 bank of keys.<br>
<br>
6) Try not to stand next to your charmed mob. If will give you a little more time to react when charm breaks. Also, if you stand far enough away, the mob may forget you momentarily and start beating on the nearest tank. This is great because recharming becomes simple.<br>
<br>
7) Haste your pet. If you really need a big boost in offense, hasting your pet will make him at least twice as effective as he was before. This should really only be tried once you get used to having a charmed pet around. But once you think you have mastered recharming, you have nothing to lose. Haste that charmed mob and do the impossible. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Give your hasted pet two Velium or fine steel daggers. Once you are feeling confident in controlling a hasted pet, move the bar up some more and give them a couple of weapons. Dont give them rusty's. Give them the real thing. Charmed pets dont follow the same rules of summoned pets. They will get the delay on the dagger but still do their damage as normal. A hasted pet with two Velium daggers can output an unbelievable ammount of damage. They will outdamage your party by two or three times.<br>
<br>
9) Get your EPIC!!! Talk about a mana saver. Imagine not having to expend mana hasting tanks. Thats just more mana you have to spend on yourself and to help you keep your pet charmed. Luckily our epic only has one extremly difficult piece to get. The rest require only minor raids. There are just a lot of them.<br>
<br>
10) When charm breaks on your mob, very quickly Tash him before you recharm. This should improve your charm durations somewhat.<br>
<br>
11) Try to charm a meelee class mobs. Caster mobs make sucky pets. They always want to cast spells and the spells are weak compared to the damage they could be doing while casting. Its too bad the mob AI is not smart enough so that when you have a shaman or cleric mob charmed, that they buff you and help keep you healed. I guess Verant looks at that as overpowering though.<br>
<br>
<br>
Im sure there are more things that I am forgetting but the above are pretty much the basics of using charm within your groups. I could think of more probably but I gotta start coming up with my next topic of the day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I personally don't have anything to add, besides agreeing.  I've found that charmed mobs can indeed do an insane amount of damage, and can REALLY turn the situation around if things start to look bad in an overpull or something like that.  I'm currently fighting in Seb, where I'm not really too high a level yet, so I've yet to begin casually charming mobs there like I used to do in SolB.  I'm actually pretty afraid to, because most of the stuff there hits quite a bit harder than what I'm used to, and I feel insecure about being level 51 and attempting to charm and survive the break.<br>
<br>
While we're on the subject, I've been finding it harder and harder to fit charm and other spells onto my spelllist during regular grouping, ESPECIALLY without a shaman..  Any suggestions on a spell lineup for Seb or other high level dungeons that anyone can offer would be most appreciated.. Currently, it's....<br>
<br>
1)  ToT<br>
2)  Charm / Slow (If there's no shaman)<br>
3)  Rune III / Buff / AE Mez (/cry where do I fit it???)<br>
4)  Tash<br>
5)  Dazzle<br>
6)  Boon of the Garou (If any melees want it) / Slow (If no melees want Boon and there's no shaman) / Charm (If there's no shaman, and no melees want Boon)<br>
7)  Color Flux<br>
8)  Color Skew<br>
<br>
My biggest problems are... WHERE do I fit some of the situation-dependant spells that i've been sacrificing lately, such as AE Mez and Charm??<br>
<br>
If there's no shaman, and there are melees who want Boon, I get very paranoid that the situation will arise where I'll need either charm or AE Mez and I won't have it memmed.  =/<br>
<br>
I thought of eliminated my Rune / Buff slow, but I have to reapply my Rune so often, there'd be a lot of spell switching.  Also, recasting a Rune in the middle of a battle / getting beaten on has saved my ass several times, and I'm afraid to walk away from the convenience.  Perhaps when I gain a level (2 yellow left) and get Rune V, the runes will be lasting longer, so I won't have to switch as much if I DO choose to sacrifice the buff slot, right?<br>
<br>
It's gotten to the point where I've been asking if there's anyone in the group who can proc slow, because I simply don't wanna give up the spell slot for it..  =/  And I don't feel right doing that.  It's my job to do that if there's no shaman... =P  Right? <p><center><img src = http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/daeonsig.jpg><br>

Here is what i normally have memmed for casual dungeon grouping :<br>
<br>
ToT<br>
Shiftless  ( Also my swap slot)<br>
Immobilize<br>
AoE mez ( level 16 one )<br>
Flux<br>
Tash<br>
Dazzle<br>
Shift<br>
<br>
I still use level 16 AoE mez, and still use Flux and Shift cause i dont normally need to do the full stunlock.  I can channel flux and shift thru just about anything, and one or the other gets resisted enough times that i want 2 of them there.  When you have a Gating class mob  (very common in Seb), you want to have a couple stuns to try to stop it.<br>
<br>
In groups with no shaman, i tell my tanks i dont have room for boon.  Im sorry, but they cant have it.  I feel it is crucial for me to have AoE mez up, as it is one of the most powerful spells we have used in the right situations.  I dont have another dedicated slot i can give up for boon unless there is a shaman in the group.<br>
<br>
If i am going to charm, i swap charm in where slow is on the pull.  If the puller says &quot; 4 inc&quot; and i want to charm one, i sit , swap in charm, and stand before pull gets there.  I drop AoE mez , Charm the lowest one, then Re aoe mez ( after issuing /pet guard here).  Now i have 2 mezzed mobs, one pet and current mob.  When my new pet is no longer mezzed, i send him in battle.<br>
<br>
AoE mez is great to use if you are going to charm, since it has a short duration.  I dont tend to keep charmed pets, unless the damage output of the group is low.  I usually just use them to help speed up the battles some, then we kill it at the end.<br>
<br>
I dont haste my pets, altho i agree that it is a good thing to do. I wont start doing that till i can haste for free with my epic (if i can get the damn shissar =P).<br>
<br>
<br>
I think it is our job to slow if there is no shaman, and in places like seb, you are cuttning the mobs damage output so much, that it should be a priority.  I dont feel proc slow cuts it, unless you are talking about Uber mobs.  I am gonna guess i feel so strongly about mobs being slow cause i was a shaman before i was an enchanter tho, so /shrug<br>

Will this mean that I'm going to be soaking more of my shaman's mana for healing when I get beaten on?  &lt;breaks out Castersrealm&gt;  Looks like a stun will give me enough casting time to get a charm off...

<br>
I've found that the best way to get exp on a trakanon raid is to charm a juggernaut.  I wish the recast time on dictate wasn't QUITE as severe.. ah well.  Dictate is still our most powerful and awe-inspiring spell.<br>
<br>
About berserker strength - this is very handy and saves the cleric a lot of mana.  Once you get Bedlam you'll never look back, I can't belive how useful this spell has turned out to be for me.<br>
<br>
Allure wand - damn thats a good idea!  What's the level limit on allure BTW?<br>
<br>
Root - I can't stress enough how much this spell rules, I wish we got more spell slots for it.  Even with the real estate of enchanter slots I often make room for root, somehow.  When you get to the high-level raid encounters where most if not all the mobs you face are unstunnable, it gets easy to remove your 2 stuns and fit root and another spell (usually dictate/GOK) for me.  On trak/jug raids my spell line up gets really warped because I don't use the stuns or theft of thought anymore.  I usually have dictate, theft of thoght, tash, dazzle, forlorn deeds, glamour of kintaz, root, clarity 2 memmed. (yes permanent slot dedicated to a buff)  In normal group situations I usually &quot;politely&quot; remind the classes that get root to mem it and use it... there is nothing more annoying than a cleric who gets aggrod and has one of those &quot;AAAHH GET IT OFF ME&quot; hotkeys and spams the group when he could just root the mob himself.  Also, rooted mobs can't summon anyone, I'm not sure why more people don't know this.<br>
<br>
Hasted pet - boy you aren't kidding about this one.  I only started doing this once I got to be a pretty high level and comfortable with charming.  I got a lot of level 59 doing the sebilis zone-in with myself and Simc, and a trusty froglok dar knight as the main tank.  When you haste your pet and slow the mob, you get some damn good results.  We kept the mob rooted easily between the 2 of us and since I didn't have too much to spend my mana on it was easy to maintain charm.  Since Simc only had to fire a complete heal every 6-7 fights on the &quot;main tank&quot; her mana situation usually never got too bad.  If I ever did get a really bad streak of charm breaks I would just dazzle both the mobs and med up until we were ready.  It was crazy good exp and pocket change, we could usually pull to the exit.<br>
<br>
Epic : yeah no kidding.. this really lets you slack on the mana and goof around with charm a lot more.<br>
<br>
Tash on your pet - this is really a big help, don't forget to tash him when he breaks, if it's worn off.  Another thing to note - the stun time on the level 20 stun is exactly the length of the casting time on Boltran's Ageracie.  Just a friendly reminder.  It's not too hard to do flux-tash, shift-charm.  <br>
<br>
Melee class mobs - definetly the more damage dealing charmed pets.  The casters are easier to keep charmed if you're worried about that, though.  They're probably good practice to try on.  When charm breaks they tend to cast a spell on you instead of running over to you and pounding on you, which makes them every easy to recharm.  Also something that is kind of fun, your charmed pet can buff and heal other pets in the group.  One time in the crypt I had an imperial crypt guardian charmed, and he CH's Venen's necro pet for us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Spell line up:  The other day I was researching a level 20 enchanter's color shift spell for him.  He asked me if it was any good, and I told him that at level 60 I still have color shift, color flux and mesmeriation memmed, I think he was pretty suprised.  My group lineup has always been:  Tash, shift, flux, theft, mesmerization, slow, dazzle, (swap spot).  I spend tons of time on my ass swtiching out spells though, it's something that you get used to.<br>
<br>
Charming to increase group effectiveness:  Once I hit 59/60 I really started messing around with keeping a charmed pet as a permanent memeber of a group, and it always suprises me how much faster we kill with a decent pet.  Before I got my epic I was with a group that wanted to do disco 2 in sebilis.  The average level was about 52 (besides me) and I wasn't sure how well we would do.  I got a dar pet and kept haste on him, and pulled for the group.  I brought back all slowed single mobs and sent my pet in for the whole night.  At 60 I could single pull all the named PHs in disco 2 and we managed to do frenzied pox, grup, commander, pickler and even Brogg PHs with the group.  It was a lot of fun.<br>

<br>
Here are some useful charm tips.  Anyone else feel free to jump in here :<br>
<br>
1) Dont charm mobs on the pull until you have the situation under control.<br>
<br>
Since breaking of charm is random, it is best to not charm mobs until you know you can deal with your former pet being pissed off at you.  This means you have pretty much total control of the situation at hand ( ie XXX mobs drooling off into space, and your group on 1).<br>
<br>
2) As Goshan stated above, try your absolute hardest to charm the lowest level mob out of the bunch.<br>
<br>
If you are outclassing the dungeon a bit ( say you were to go to CT sael), Even a green pet is good, actually preferable.  The more levels between you and the mob, the better chance your charm will hold longer.<br>
<br>
3) Learn to deal with the threat of the mob breaking charm<br>
<br>
This bothers me too, and its one of the reasons i dont haste my pets.  On the other hand, we all have to remember one important fact :  We see pissed off mobs rushing us ALL DAY LONG, and an ex pet is just one more pissed off mob rushing us.  When you look at it like that, and realize you have been dealing with pissed off mobs rushing you for dozens and dozens of levels, the mental part of charming gets easier.<br>
<br>
4) Dont Charm in places where the mobs are HIGH blue to you, or higher, unless it is as a final Crowd control measure.  <br>
<br>
What i mean by that is, Dont plan on doing a lot of charming in Sebilis at level 50-51.  Dont plan on doing a lot of charming in Lower guk at 36.  DO plan on doing a lot of charming in Lower guk at 45+ though, and in sebilis 54 +.  This is all in the &quot; level is king&quot; category.  I am not saying charm doesnt work in the other situations, but you will have less short duration charms, and more success, if you stay with mobs a significant lower level than you.<br>
<br>
5) Practice charm soloing. <br>
<br>
Once you get used to the idea of charming solo, it becomes easier in a group.  There are 2 distinct times i remember thinking &quot; DAMN now im an enchanter !!!&quot;.  The first was my first big train i stopped in CT, where i KNOW we would have all died if i hadnt controlled it.<br>
<br>
The second was charm soloing spectres, and killing 4 spectres at once easier than a group could at my level.  Charm is AWE inspiring power, especially when your pet is hitting for 100+.  There are some really good guides for charm soloing over at casters realm.<br>
<br>
Dont buff your pet till you feel comfortable doing so.  I reccomnend you REALLY outclass the mob to use this tactic.  It is Safer (but not as efficent) to slow the mob your pet is fighting, rather than hasting your pet.  Once you get to the point where you outclass most mobs (/wave errtai , goshan), this becomes a GREAT way of doing damage, and i know enchanters with epic will toss shissar on a charmed pet and outdamage their whole group EASILY.<br>
<br>
Cant think of anything else off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
Charming is a viable tactic at your level, depending on where you hunt.  Its never too late to start !<br>

Now, especially in seb, I use charm all the time, most often when I am sorta bored though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I  don't yet feel comfortable hasting my pet (something so pissed it can't be taunted off of me with AQ on it??  Eww!), but I do feel comfortable charming just about anything in the &quot;normal&quot; exp camps in seb.<br>
<br>
Charming is fun, and a great way to make stuff go faster and be more exciting.  Plus, I just love spouting off my charm message: &lt; %T &gt;  has been ravished by my devastating charm! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://alundraadjani.com/otherstuff/eq/sig3.jpg">

It's one of the most entertaining spells in the enchanter lineup.  <br>
<br>
Pre - 53, root is the best friend of a charmer.  Especially now with the changes to root/snare there's really no rason not to have it up all the time.<br>
<br>
At 53rd you get a wonderful upgrade to charm heh.  Lower resist, longer duration ( it seems anyway ), and shorter casting time make it a cornerstone in my spell list.  At 53rd, you can get charm off between stuns.  Anytime I don't have to slow for the group, I have charm up.<br>
<br>
Often times in Seb ( or any other non-SoV dungeon ) I'll either <br>
<br>
1. Take a pet, usually wizard or tank, and hold it for a very long time or<br>
<br>
2. Encourage the tank to bring back 3-4 mobs, charm one, and mez the others.  It's lots of fun and allows the enchanter to contribute a very significant amount of damage.  If your tank's are so inclined you can even help offload damage to them if you can get em to stop taunting heh.  <br>
<br>
Whatever you do, it's really important to communciate your intentions to charm with whoever is slowing in the group.  Otherwise your potential pet will end up watching most of the fight instead of contributing.  <br>
<br>
I'm with Adjani and Llorian, I don't ever haste my pets.  Some of those mobs - especially tanks - are fast enough on their own! heh.  I've been in situations where they've even managed to interrupt color flux.  The idea of a hasted version looking to own me... well .. it isn't that appealing heh.  Plus, looking at the big picture, a enchanter that's alive with a non-hasted pet is MUCH more valuable than a dead enchanter with a former pet who is still enjoying the effects of haste <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So there's risk/reward there as well you have to take into consideration.<br>
<br>
One of my favorite pets of all time has to be the Golems in Chardok heh.  They are soooo much fun to charm *evil grin* and do insane amounts of damage.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

<br>
Decided to hop on down into the Crypt in Seb, and take on some badass necro thing... Emperor Chottal or something (My first time in Crypt.. /shrug)<br>
<br>
Btw - this is a first - I've never had something pet's resist me, but uh, his resisted mez a couple times during the fight.  Kinda scary.<br>
<br>
We were kicking ass until the pally went LD in the middle of the fight.  That put a major dent in our melee power, as our pally even had his Fiery Defender =(  <br>
<br>
I had been told I was supposed to be mana sieving, because this necro guy would gate and kill us all if he had the mana to do it, and so I started blowing all my mana on sieve, which was, of course, a bad idea.<br>
<br>
Anyway, some Skeletal Champion thing added, and so instead of mezzing it, I charmed it.  It started beating down the the Emperor, and the he started gating.  I let loose with mana sieves all over the place and we killed him.  Just in time for charm to break on the champion AND the pet, and for out SK to get killed.  Evac was called, rogue looted emperor (couple spells and some sword, he said), and I promptly died, as did the druid, and rogue.  Only the cleric gated out alive.<br>
<br>
Pally came back from LD to a warm welcome and also promptly died.<br>
<br>
But it almost worked!<br>

Gate cost so little mana that a mob regens probably twice enough mana every tick to get a gate off. You CAN stop mobs from complete healing, with 2 enchanters but if a mob is gonna gate, sieve isnt going to stop it. The best way to stop a mob gating is to simply fight him at his bind point. If the mob is at or close to his bind point, he will not gate. If that is not possible, all tanks should get on one side of a mob(even those rogues) and push it backward. The movement will interrupt its casting. Dont push it into a wall. Keep pushing it backwards along a hall or something. <br>
<br>
Other ways to interrupt casting is with your mezzes, with your Direct Damage spells, with mem blur, and your stuns.<br>
