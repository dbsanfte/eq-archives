<br>
While hurtling through the air, Uhgree wondered again what feet were for. It seemed he was spending far more time in flight these past few days than actually walking. Well, stumbling and tripping would be more accurate. The wall, tree, or floor that ended the infant troll's flight was less forgiving than the leather boot that was making Uhgree think he should be some sort of bird.<br>
<br>
He was not alone. Many other trollings were in similar flight around him. Not all enjoyed the time in flight as Uhgree did, though. Most just screamed hysterically or excreted freely whatever was in them at the time.<br>
<br>
Today's herdsman showed the most cruelty to the young ones. It was time to weed out the weaklings. There was only so much food to go around in Grobb and Bukrak had been given this task during his meal. Knowing full well that his brothers would devour his share before he even left the hall, he had decided these little bastards would pay for his hunger.<br>
<br>
Booting, slapping, and whipping about two dozen naked trollings, he guided them to the swamp for their big test. Many trollings stood dumbfounded at the vastness of the swamp before them. None had been out this far. This merely infuriated Bukrak, standing over this mass of dung-spitters which suddenly stopped to stare. Bukrak growled and spit at the gathering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time ta ern yaz keep! Git sum fud an BRINGZ IT BAK!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The nearby Bashers took this as their cue that the fun could begin. One Basher simply dropped his sword and shield so he could lift one of the toddlers. Holding the youngling out in front of him, he took a few steps and let go. The falling trolling met a heavy iron boot rising swiftly. The flight went rather smoothly until a low branch sent the trolling flipping to land in the swamp.<br>
<br>
Hoots and howls arose from the Bashers and troll children. The trolling laughter became frightened screeches once the Bashers turned on them for the next round. In seconds, the air was full of flying, screaming trollings. Most landed in the fetid waters of Innothule, a couple hung swinging from mossy vines in the trees. One unlucky runt hit the back of a gator and became lunch. Those close to the gator fled back to the launch site only to be met by the waiting Bashers for a second flight.<br>
<br>
Uhgree's flight almost landed him on the next patch of land. The shallow water broke enough of the landing that Uhgree was able to stand up immediately instead of having to wait a minute or two for his bones to knit again. Uhgree squealed with delight. Looking around, he found himself pretty much lost. He saw the fires of the Bashers' camps and marked that as the place to go after finding food.<br>
<br>
Bukrak took this opportunity to sneak a few portions of the Bashers' snacks they had left untended. The Bashers were busy intercepting the retreating trollings that had not found anything yet. One trolling almost slipped past undetected. Bashers are quick, though. &quot;Aw, naw yaz dunt!!&quot; Catching the arm of the errant trolling, the Basher wheeled around in a circle three times before letting go.<br>
<br>
Uhgree saw him coming. Spinning dizzily out of control, this trolling landed fully into a rotting skeleton that was simply standing idly by a tree, unaware of its fate. The trolling smashed into the skeleton, slamming it against the tree. Uhgree could not tell if the sickening crunch was from his brother or the pile of bones that was once a skeleton. Neither moved. That thought was quickly followed by a fun idea. He could see  most trollings getting chased or worse by a few of the swamp's denizens. He knew he had to find food and get back soon or he may die at the hands of kobolds or worse.<br>
<br>
Uhgree climbed the nearest tree, waited and watched. The trollings that made it back with acceptable food were having the best luck with snakes and rats. Uhgree wanted better and looked for something different. There was a soft sucking sound nearby, like something big was pulling its feet from the mud as it trudged along. Uhgree hid the best he could while watching below. A huge round red disc bobbed below. It had white spots spread over it and smelled acrid. Uhgree froze at the site and let it pass. With a better view, he saw the humanoid form that held up the mushroom cap that is the Fungus Tracker's head. Skittering around the Tracker were much smaller versions of the Fungus.<br>
<br>
Uhgree dropped from the tree to land with a belly flop on a trailing Spore. Scrambling to his feet and scooping up the smashed spore, Uhgree made a mad dash for home. The other Spores were only half the size of Uhgree and fell behind soon enough. But the Tracker was gaining ground fast. A stretch of water had to be crossed to get back to the Basher camps. Uhgree headed for a neaby rock and ducked down for a full run. He could smell the Tracker getting closer. Springing from the rock, Uhgree made good distance across the water but still fell short. The unsure footing saved Uhgree's short life thus far. Slipping in the mud, he landed face down in the muck. The Tracker's appendage bludgeoned a tree root instead of Uhgree's head.<br>
<br>
Making sure he still had the spore, Uhgree half crawled under the root and came out the other side. The root was home to a large rat that did not appreciate the intrusion and ruckus. It tried to nip at Uhgree's bare butt and instead got whacked by the Tracker. The rat turned instantly on the Fungus man. The rat was no match for the mighty Tracker but it bought Uhgree enough time to get out of arm's reach.<br>
<br>
It wasn't too far but the Bashers were busy with those trollings that had come back already. Panting for breath, Uhgree did not dare stop. He instinctively knew that to live, he would have to keep moving without tripping. When he reached the outer-most camp, Uhgree squealed his head off to get attention. Two bashers looked his way and quickly picked up their weapons. They made short work of the Tracker and a few snakes Uhgree had stepped on in his blind sprint.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dayum, runt! Yooz brawt bak a Tracka. Yooz iz gud! Git anudda!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Basher picked up Uhgree for another boot but was halted with some icy words.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe that one has proven his worth. Don't let your belly's greed get you killed. I don't think the Shaman guild would take kindly to your chancing a loss of a potential worker of magic.&quot; The dark elf that had spoken stood fast in the face of the mighty Bashers. Sure they could wipe him without effort, especially this young upstart. The Basher wasn't very bright but certainly knew that you just don't cross the dark elves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tankeez mista!&quot;, Uhgree piped out after his feet were on solid ground again.<br>
<br>
&quot;The name is Zambone, kid. If you live long enough, come to Neriak. We are in need of young shamans.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Meez dunt uze no majik&quot;, a confused Uhgree murmured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet, little one. But you will. The rules here are that those who brought back rats, will be trained as warriors. Snakes get to be the Shadowknights of Grobb. But you...you brought back one of the Fungus people,&quot; Zambone pointed to the smashed spore, &quot;and managed to avoid a Tracker at that! You will know the ways of a shaman soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
The trollings were herded back into Grobb. Not as roughly as before now that a dark elf who held interest in Grobb recruits was present. The would-be warriors and shadowknights were taken to their respective guilds while Uhgree was ushered into the stinking realm of shaman training. Through all that Uhgree was about to endure, the image of a dark elf speaking on his behalf would help strengthen his resolve. That and the desire to visit Neriak one day, the home of the dark elves.<br>
<br>
/ooc This will be the first chapter of Uhgree's adventures. I plan on writing more and will post them here when they are done.<br>
