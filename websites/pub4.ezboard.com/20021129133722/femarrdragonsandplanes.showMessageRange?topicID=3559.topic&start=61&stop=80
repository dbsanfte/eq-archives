Sure... you want to speak spanish or french while in your house or out with friends then by all means thats fine.  Its america, you have that right.  Freedom of speech is guarenteed, in any language.<br>
<br>
The problem is that we have to communicate when the need arises.  EVERY american citizen has the rights, AND the responsibilities of living in this country.  Suppose someone is a full american citizen but speaks no english.  Suppose they are sent to war, what good are they to the guy next to them if they can't communicate?  I am sure they would have someone in the group who can translate, maybe even have their whole group speak the same language... but how far does it go?<br>
<br>
I enjoy diversity.  I love Mexican food, love it twice as much in a place with authentic music and decorations, love it 10 times as much in the home of a mexican grand mother.  I even love the sound of the language.  I would love to be able to communicate though.  When I was in mexico I didn't expect them to speak my language, and I tried my hardest.  In my back yard its different.<br>
<br>
It is possible to hold on to your culture and still learn to speak english. <p><img src=http://www.mindspring.com/~cnjmorris/catcen.jpg>

I first off want to say that all of you screaming "racism" should take a look at the wording of your post. When you address anyone white it is almost always followed with a derrogatory remark. We all have things we do not like about the people and society we live in but one good turn does NOT deserve another.<br>
Where to start ...  /rant on<br>
I value a lot of points here about how language can be a deciding factor on the lives of people within our country. It really has more to do with language than most of you would like to admit. Your own racial bias and background are the basis of an opinion and not always facts.(as mine do here)<br>
To start, I am white. This wasn't a choice I made in the circle of life but like everyone else I live with it. I speak english as my only launguage and have taught my children the same. My parents did not know any other language but English so of course we were taught that as well. My point is that English has always been considered the launguage of this country (no history crap required here), it goes back many generations as with any culture. How is it that now I will have to learn Spanish to accomodate people coming to this country to live, some even illegally ? My children sit in a classroom where spanish is now required and even some teachers are requiring translators. With children living with English as their primary language it is no wonder our education system lacks. With the little money teachers make, asking them to be bilangual as well will certainly weed out the weak ones (sarcasm). I am more concerned that my children learn how to read, write and speak english before trying to decifer a totally different language. (here goes the "children learn quicker than adults .. blah blah.) English is a language used in more countries throughout the world than any other. I expect that my children will be able to communicate well no matter where they choose to be.<br>
I work in a business where there are many different cultures represented yet they all get the concept that we need ONE common language to communicate with. Why is it so difficult for others that come to this country to grasp the same concept. I am not being mean or trying to hurt your feelings when I tell you I don't understand what you are saying, because frankly I just don't understand !<br>
I am totally for diversity and culture entwined within our neighborhoods but at what price ?  I wouldn't go to another country and expect them to change everything surrounding their language to accomodate me .. it's just plain silly.<br>
As for the one that said take some classes and learn other languages ... are you going to pay for it ? Will you come to work for me while I take these classes?  I am raising 4 kids, working full time and trying to live .. how about you ?<br>

If you profess to be tolerant of all people, except those that dont agree with you,<br>

If you are NOT better that such, then what gives you the right to be so<br>

<br>
Its made quite clear by the US gov't that if you would like to be an &quot;official&quot; US citizen you must infact learn atleast the rudimentary skills of the English language and then pass a test proving so.<br>
<br>
Unless you are over 50 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> and</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have lived in this country atleast 20 years, or are mentally handicapped. <br>
<br>
I don't think wanting someone to speak the native language is being racist. By definition it doesn't work. Someone's race isn't in question, but the form of language they use in the country in which they live.<br>
<br>
Like has been stated, if I was to move to France I would atleast make an attempt to learn enough French to be able to call the police or fire department. <p><table align=center>

Stand at the f.ucking border and issue an english test why dont you, or better yet, if your so f.ucking concerned about what language someone speaks, maybe you should take the time out of your oh so busy schedule of, lemme guess, playing EQ? and try and teach some youngsters how to actually f.ucking speak it?!?! <br>
<br>
Cry me a f.ucking river!<br>
<br>
and yes, I have been to Mexico many times. I know many Spanish , Mexican people. Some are very good friends, who would without a doubt, give me the shirt off their backs. The governement (namely the federalis) are very corrupt. If your ever in Mexico and get pulled over by the military, put a $20 bill behind your Drivers License, they will take the money(as thats all they want) and let you go, if for some reason they dont, demand to speak to their superior...they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> will</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> let you go. &lt;speaks from experience&gt;<br>
<br>
Deep into Mexico, things arent as bad. When you get to the border however, there is a noticible difference. Day and night. How a community that sits so close to such a powerful nation can live in such poverty is beyond me.<br>
<br>
You are a prime example of the word ' Gringo '!<br>
<br>
I hope you dont teach your children such ignorance.<br>

I can guarantee it hasn't been for the last week, prior to that I played twice, and then go back another full MONTH before you hit the time I played even HALF time. The last time I played full time, where I was on for a time period greater than 4 hours in a given day, was almost 6 months ago.<br>

I would just like, for ONE DAY, to be able to do my job without having to call someone up to explain that only clothes and shoes are 75% off clearance. Just one day without having to do that would be nice. <p><center><A HREF="http://www.clanautumnwood.com" TARGET="_top">

Your right, if you are in this country I expect you to speak English. If you are in France I expect you to speak French. It's called a commom language of a country!! Am I missing something with that statement? Is it too complicated? <p>Flubbin<br>

um, dude, I respect your opinion on a lot of things you post on this board, but yer way off on this one. Its not like a lot of them just decide &quot; hey lets go to America next month, it oughta be a hoot. But we better learn English first.&quot; Im sorry, but it dont work that way.

So if someone comes to England to escape poverty, to want a better future for their children, to be able to live with a roof over their head, your the kind of person to say &quot;get out until you can speak the language?&quot; Why not go one step further and just have them executed.<br>
 YOu do know there was someone who did take that extra step, you know, to have those who didnt speak the same language executed? His name was Hitler.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I would suggest YOU get all your facts as to WHY people leave Mexico, and under what circumstances. Its not like your going on a vacation to another country. Or better yet, the next time your in America, visit a border town. now, who looks ignorant here.<br>
<br>
Gnoomercy hit the nail on the head. People leave Mexico most in part to be able to support thier families who still live in mexico, to be able to offer their children a place of education, a place of work, a decent life. Usually its not a planned thing to come to the states, but more of an opportunity. You surely cant expect someone to learn a language before coming here under those circumstances.<br>
<br>
Kulani said it herself, they are not buying Gucci shoes, or shopping in Beverly Hills, there asking about something marked 75% off. Hellooo, doesnt this mean anything to anyone?<br>
<br>
And if you want to talk about universal languages..<br>
<br>
MAth is the Universal language. i + i = ii , no matter where you go in this universe, in this reality, i + i will ALWAYS = ii . You bombed a math test. Under your own testimony, you should not be allowed to live in this plane of existance.<br>

No, but I can and do expect them to try and learn the language. <p>Flubbin<br>

<br>
Does the store in question have a sign that says<br>
<br>
&quot; Si Habla Espanol &quot;?<br>
<br>
if so, then move your a.ss back from which it came, and get another job.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as expecting them to try and learn the language.<br>
Uh, I would assume they were if they knew how to dial the number to the department store. Or be able to get a phone hooked up in the first place. Or even were under the assumption that the fabric softener was marked 75% off. So they didnt understand what it meant by clothes only.<br>
<br>
And as far as trying to learn, do you think their children dont speak english? In fact many immigrants to America do not speak english, many have their children translate for them. Why? well, becuase thats why they brought their children here, to have a higher education, to be able to take care of their childrens children, whilst they are out tryin (and many non-english speaking immigrants dont work the 9-5 type hours, nor do they have the money to afford a higher learning for themselves as they believe their children come first) to be able to support their children to be able to do so.<br>
<br>
Its not about ' NOT WANTING ' to learn English, many just dont have the means to do so. <br>
<br>
And just because some are lazy , its not like we have any lazy Americans either? Its still not fair to those to call out Mexicans as a whole.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know of that Italian grandmother who lives in NewYork, she dont speak a lick of english (her children do), she has no intent to learn English, but she can make the best pasta that side of the Mississippi. Why not attack her too? She didnt take the time out of her life of trying to raise her children to learn English..no, she thought of only her children rather than herself. I think she may need to be deported?<br>
<br>
To lump a society as a whole to be this way is wrong. It IS racist. Just as the title of the thread says. <br>
<br>
&quot; Off topic Racist Rant &quot;  meaning its either <br>
a) a rant about racist people<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
b) Someone ranting about a certain race. (which IS racist)<br>
<br>
And before anyone says that no one did lump the society in as a whole, look again. No where does it call out any individual, instead the society (Mexican) was called out. That IS lumping it as a whole.<br>
<br>
On that note, the next time I see a black man beggin on the street corner, could I assume that all blacks are begging on the street corner? That none of them have a job? It would be racist of me if I did.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW..rather than be a bitch about it, have you done anything to help the problem? If you want to help, goto your local library and ask about donating books to the yung'ins to help them learn how to read English. After you have done that, then and only then, will you have a right to complain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usoopaflydpgc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SoopaflyDPGC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/21/02 11:37:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3559.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> To the guy who said spanish was a trash language<br>
Fvck you. Correct if Im wrong but English is made of many different languages...including spanish. Im not mexican or anything, my family comes from El Salvador and my parents dont speak english very well, as for me and my brothers we learned it from my best friend down the street. If youre gonna come here and bitch about Mexicans and hispanic people just because you cant speak the language you are stupid. Im bilingual(sp?) and I know some French(Fookin High School French) not enough to make conversation so I never speak it cause I dont want to make myself look like a retard. <br>
