I forget what he did about it, but it upset the KSer badly enough that he threatened to have his higher level wizard pal come get revenge.  Monk dude ignores him, and sure enough... here comes Mr. Wizard using the old levitate exploit (back then mobs couldn't hit you if you were levitated out of their reach) and starts offing the poor monk's mobs.  Now, for a long time pumice stones were very popular among monks, so... out comes the stone, the levitate gets dispelled, and boom.  The poor wiz takes a bunch of falling damage and then gets overrun by the aviak he had aggroed.  He stopped after that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think Ewle and Ebonlore's reputation had much to do with:<br>
<br>
- Norrath was smaller world then and more bickering over camps.<br>
- more innocent days / people not so blasé<br>
- fewer people and reputations stuck<br>
- an exp res almost unheard of<br>
<br>
Ewle &amp; Co were infamous for acting badly though claiming it was RP. I remember one who stole my camp by simply training me (necro) – when I met him again he actually thought I’d be willing to group with him haha!<br>

Conversely, I can see the humour in  Slayne’s uninvising light races running through Nek Forest though.  Its not like it takes a great amount of wit to run along the zone wall rather than main path.

Ewle used to do all that people stated here and more.  One of my other experiences of her was when she came into Najena after we had cleared to Drelzna's room and set up camp and began to KS every Drelzna pop till we left.  This was also during the time when casters could usually KS anything if they nuked really hard.  Especially since the best weapon at the time for melee was a Mino-axe.<br>

I was in EKarana at the time the announcement was made.  There was a significant amount of discussion at the time in ooc's. People cheering, other people cheering so they didn't seem out of the loop, and people asking who Ewle was.  <br>

What annoyed me most was the chants of /shout EBONLORE. CHAOTIC EVIL AT IT'S BEST everytime they entered a zone. This was often echoed my members who were already in situ in a zone.<br>
<br>
Ewle was eventually banned when Uini invited herself to Ebonlore after a deliberate train of guards to the Nektulos/East commons zon which wiped out a whole guild. She was just in time to hear Ewle announce to the guild that Uini was a wuss because she only had x number of hit points. Uini had exactly x number of hit points at the time and promptly disbanded the guild for using ShowEQ and other various other hacks. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://ak.lonelygamer.com">

<br>
It was pretty well accepted back then to PK good (or evil) races back then in the name of RP. I even had a GM tell me it was OK to train guards because Verant (at the time) considered it &quot;calling the cops&quot;<br>
 <br>
We (the Shadow Guard) even had a nasty trick pulled on us once when we tried to invade G fay, we bound in G fay by the zone to BB but when we were buffing and doing a little RP with the lesser races there someone trained a half dozen HE guards into us the ones &quot;lucky&quot; enough to zone back were met with Dwarf guards trained to the other side.<br>
 <br>
This set up a rather nasty death loop and several people lost levels trying to get out of it. We were mostly mid-teens back then so died rather quickly.<br>
<br>
We petitioned and were told by a GM that they were just calling the cops and to suck it up. (though I think some disipinary action may have been taken later as Maugrim said he was going to write Verant about it I never heard anymore about it).<br>
<br>
Even with Ewle she never got suspended for training, hell the reason the GM was there in Guk that day was because she had petitioned that Vendrix had trained her!! it was the ShowEQ that got her in the end.<br>

So I remake all my hotkeys, put some gear on him and head to Lower Guk for some xp.<br>
<br>
I zone in, do the whole, “level 45 necro lfg” thing and within a few minutes I get a /tell from some group doing the Executioner and Sage area, sounds good to me. So I head down and we are doing pretty well, I speed up their kill rate a bit and the puller seems fine with going out and getting more. We switch rooms depending on when something is going to spawn. At some point it came time to move up to the Sage room and await the pops there, when Ewle strolls in, sits down right in the middle of my group, stands up and casts a pet. Right away I let her know that if she’s thinking of taking this spawn from us with no discussion what so ever, she’s got another thing coming.<br>
<br>
So a mob spawns and we attack it, as does she. I can’t exactly recall who got the kill, it was a moot point because I knew she was trying – and that just wasn’t going to happen on my watch. I warned her again, and she attacked the next mob, that did it. I told my group to exit the room and that I was going to disband so I didn’t get them into a pile of shit with her, or GMs. I tell them to sit tight in the Exe room and that I’ll have Ewle out of the Sage room in no time.<br>
<br>
So everyone clears out and the fun begins…<br>
<br>
I run down to the Cavalier room, full spawn with regular mobs. I solo pull one and bring it right to the Sage room while she’s fighting with something, and FD. Now, as you know, it’s fairly difficult to train someone who can FD, except someone who isn't smart enough to use their 3rd person perspective views. She managed to kill the one she was fighting and FD just after the add killed her pet, but she didn’t know that I stood up and tagged it, along with two roamers, as it was going home. So there were a total of three standing on me, just around the corner from her when she stood up, thinking it was safe.<br>

<br>
I AFK for 5 minutes to roll around on the ground, laughing hysterically.<br>
<br>
15 minutes later, she’s back to get her corpse… I train her while she’s looting it.<br>

Ewle, “I petitioned you, you’re being watched”<br>
<br>
I take another AFK for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
She comes back and this time she’s smart enough to /corpse herself out of the Sage room before looting. She’s got a Cleric with her this time, I guess thinking that made her somewhat safer, to res her two existing corpses. I train her and the Cleric, then offer to drag him to the zone and get him a 49 res.<br>
<br>
/ all Ewle<br>
Ewle[50 Necromancer] &lt;Ebonlore&gt; East Commons<br>
There is one player in Everquest<br>
<br>
You tell Ewle, “pavlov’s dog &gt; Ewle”<br>
<br>
She didn’t have a comment this time, because she really did petition… that was a mistake. About this time Kzzern wanders in and I brief him to the situation, we decide that it’s payback time for everyone she’s fucked over in the months past and she wasn’t getting anything except xp loss, and she didn’t. So she gets her corpse(s) and, possibly a res, and then comes back down to the House of Pain – fool! Kzzern and I watched her from afar to see where she setup, this time it was near those Gargoyles just outside the Assassin room.<br>
<br>
She casts a pet and we nail her, from both sides I think. She manages to FD this time and a / Ewle shows that she went LD to clear agro, dumbass. We know where she went LD, we know she’s coming right back, so Kzzern and I park a casting Froglock right where she dropped and keep it Screaming Terror’d. When we see her log back in we FD, the Frog immediately agro’s her and she’s dead before she’s even in control – too bad(btw, still bound in EC…)!<br>
<br>
We take up positions to ruin her day, over and over again, when I get a /tell from someone important – Uini. I was told that Ewle was being watched closely(which meant I was being watch, uhhh… train her, closely) and Uini was looking for something, anything, to ban her for. So I kept a dialogue of taunting going between Ewle and myself. Hoping she would fuck up and admit to something… she did. Like someone mentioned, she made a comment about Uini’s hit points, letting the powers that be know she was using ShowEQ(they could have just looked on her web site and known). Exactly 2 minutes after my last tell to her, she was gone…<br>

90% of the time a wizard / necro / mage / druid could run up and watch you get it down to  sliver of life, then nuke and loot your mob.  Only took 1 nuke to get the kill for casters back in the day. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

<br>
I prolly should have clarified.  The players I did this too used to RP against me.  We did stuff like this to each other all the time and the players I did this too knew who I was.  They never died but I made it rough on them to pass.  We had a good chuckle at it.<br>
<br>
So please dont read it as I just randomly annuled peeps as they went through to screw with them, because I didnt.  Just the players I knew and when we were just messing around.<br>

I remember running through Nek forest and I came across this dwarven rogue (from Ebonlore) that was running from these skels.  Well, I told him to stop and kept him healed while he killed the skels.  He thanked me for the help and seemed like a pretty nice guy.  Then, along comes this Ebonlore dark elf SK who proceeds to curse the dwarf up and down.  I just couldn't believe that a guildmate would treat a peer this way (he was really letting him have it).  Finally I couldn't stand the way the SK was treating this rogue and challenged the SK to a duel.  Of course he declined.  Bullies tend to stick to those that they know they can intimidate (the SK was a few levels higher than the rogue).  I remember asking the rogue why he would take that kind of grief and why he would remain in a guild that would recruit such assholes, but I don't remember his reply, only that I felt sorry for the guy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 2629<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/11/02 7:22:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3016.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ewle, and that day in Lower Guk…</span><hr size=1> Chiteng why must you turn every fucking topic into another one of your useless crusades against Vendrix and Da'kor ?<br>
