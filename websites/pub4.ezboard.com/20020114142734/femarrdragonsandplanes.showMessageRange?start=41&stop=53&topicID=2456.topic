Pickup raids are an exercise in controlled chaos.  If the non-leaders start trying to take charge, the chaos could actually get much worse.  Remember that EQ is populated with know-it-alls who are convinced that they know how to run a raid better than anyone, especially the actual raid leaders.<br>
<br>
The right way to handle this situation is to volunteer to help, and to get the raid leader to delegate a task to you.  If the raid leader says no, and the situation is getting worse, then it's time to make a graceful departure.<br>
<br>
Back when I was an officer in the Sons of Tao, I wrote a guide for my guildmates who were reaching the level range that would allow them to join raids.  The guide contains the following advice:<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> First and foremost,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> make sure that the people you are going with know what they're doing.  Most raids can lead to catastrophic results for your character.  A few people have lost multiple levels on a single raid, and on occasion people have been unable to recover their corpses, and thus have lost all of their gear.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Just because someone says that they know what they're doing does not mean that they do.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  EQ is full of blowhards who will get you killed.  If you have doubts about whether the raid organizers know what they're doing, either get the hell out of the raid, or don't whine about it later.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uvishanti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vishanti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/28/01 8:38:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Disappointed</span><hr size=1> <blockquote><i><b>Sagemon Prayeth</b> wrote:</i><hr>EQ is full of blowhards who will get you killed.<hr></blockquote>I get killed on every raid I go on with Sagemon...<br>

Sounds like another person decided to flame me because they didn't know all the facts.  It's really quite amusing.  I guess it comes with being a raid leader, half the people will like you, and the other half will find a reason not to.<br>

<br>
First, this was my second dragon raid. My first Naggy raid. <br>
<br>
What did I do to help the situation? I shut up and let the leader lead. No I don't think they come in with &quot;Leading Raids 101&quot; but I assume someone leading a raid has been on a few successful ones and can lead by example. <br>
<br>
&quot;next time you done know the main assist try ASKING &quot; We did. Several times. As I stated earlier, when we first got there it was complete chaos. We still had ppl trickling in and milling about trying to make grps for about a half-hour. Eventually we got told Dararu was MA.<br>
<br>
&quot;Got 2 clerics and the tank group has none?<br>
BOOT ONE OF YOURS AND TELL OTHER GROUP TO GIVE YOU ONE OF THEIR TANKS&quot; Uhm...no. We were told that the clerics would be all in one grp. So we should undermine the raid leaders strat and his authority and do what we want? On Kerna's raid against Vox we were told &quot;Do exactly as I say. Do not deviate and we WILL be successful&quot;. And we were. So that's what I learned from. Your way seems a sure way to get killed as people start arguing over the best way to do things and stop paying attention to the task at hand. I think it's easy for people on the outside to say &quot;This is what you should have done...blah blah blah....you fucking moron...blah blah blah&quot;, but I also don't have a special version of EQ with &quot;Taking Over Raids 101&quot;.<br>
<br>
Alot of people have to learn by example. This raid in general just happened to be a poor example (or a good one of what not to do). Try to remember you were new once, too. <br>

How dume is that? In that case lets put warriros in one group and so on and on. I had never had that kind of problems  like I did that day. I had people who must have been blind (play everquest, just push this little buttun honey ). I told raid in chatroom that when dararu was building up agro all clerics spam heal her. I will put 2 druids in in one group to just heal dararu after we go into battle. By the way I ooc the main assist so many times and everytime I would have people who might have been not paying attention or did not know how to follow orders shout or ooc who is main assist. Do you want me to tell you in tells who main assist is?<br>
<br>
     I have always asked clreics to invite people to there groups and be group leaders. But there are some people who tend not too follow orders than come to this board and bitch here and there. In any raid you will always see a cleric lead groups. I dont botther in giving you a specific group while killing FG's. I just tell you to tell a cleric in my raid and give you the names so you can let him or her Know that you need a group. I guess I will have to chage that, dont want people bitching on this boards about how they didnt get assign a group. Sorry if I sound a bit harsh but dam people just open there mouth  and spam the hell out out of Raid leaders and expect him or her to respond imidiatly.<br>
<br>
    I hope people undestand that when you go on a pick up raid it will be hard orgenize this people since most of them are un expirience and dont know what main assist is. I know, at that level you should know but like Mitch said, People need to use common sence and say somthing about it such as tell the group leader he or she has 2 clerics instead of just being quiet and than if everything goes wrong blame the hell out of hte raid leader for not noticing such groups. Like I said above, I will be changing my raid structure and treat all raiders as un experience, and I might start shouting and booting people out of raids who do not listen etc. <br>

I have raided with Kerna a few times and the raids go off without a hitch.  He makes it plain and simple what everyone is to do and aske if there are any questions.  If most of the players on those raids were unexperienced it sure didn't show.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, my first dragon raid was a pick up raid with him and we had a total of 2 deaths and no one in my group died.  Players may be unexperienced, but that does not equate to stupidity.  Granted a few players may be unexperienced AT DRAGON RAIDS, but have played the game for a while and may have some common sense.  So lumping players in a pick up raid into an &quot;un experience&quot; (unexperienced) category is preposterous.<br>

I know many of my raiders who are super smart and know what there doing but just 2 people in every group who might be there first time in a dragon raid will blow it. Like for example in my last raid main assist was shouting attack this and I would see some people try to attack somthing else. I guess they might have wanted to get the exp by doing some damage before the whole raid beat up on it. But, that shows lack of expirience in them. When everyone attacks one mob it dies in a few seconds rather than people going off and attacking one mob and hoping that will get them the exp. In a raid we dont go for exp we go and try to better our equipment when we do hunt for exp our group's will benefit from our well equiped chars'.<br>
   <br>
    But, if I treat people as unexpirience I will make my raids smoother than before. I think Kerna does treat people as unexpirience when he gives them groups, tells them to &quot;chut the hell up&quot; (I was there when he address people who did not be quiet while he was giving information regarding the buffing). So he might not tell you you are un expirience but he does give credit to some people in his raids such I did when I placed some one as main assist. Why? because a main assist should know when he has built enough agro that the mob wont go running off and attack a healer, nuker when he or she attacks the mob. But enough of this endless subject. <br>
