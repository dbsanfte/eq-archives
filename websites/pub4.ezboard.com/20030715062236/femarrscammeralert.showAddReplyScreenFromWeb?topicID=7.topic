Saw this board and thought Id let you read about what happened to me once. Sorry it did cause its kinda hard for me to trust anyone right now. <br>
<br>
The scam took place back the last week of April. I never did get my things back because the Server GM left Verant and the new Server GM never returned any of my posts. This kinda pised me off and I was getting burned out by EQ so I took a 2 month leave from the game. <br>
<br>
Well after hard work I finally was able to get another Runed Falchion and Siler Plated Leggings. Even made enough money to buy a SSOY. Still have both items on me to this day.<br>
<br>
The following is from the posts on our Guild Boards. I went and found it so I could post it here. I have basically gave up on ever getting these items back, but would like to know if anyone else have ran into a problem like this.<br>
<br>
A little background. Kuroi was our guild leader, she has now left playing EQ, and at the time we were engaged to be married. i knew her in RL from emails and talking to her on the phone so I knew a lot about her. Even personal things.<br>
<br>
This Rilian character who scammed me seemed to know a lot of things about her and me and our guild. I suspect it was an inside job but will not point any fingers. The guild has changed a bit now, and is currently undergoing so changes, but everything is fine. <br>
<br>
I finally decided to take what happened to me as a lesson learned.<br>
<br>
The following is just FYI:<br>

Ok, for those of you who do not know - I was scammed out of a couple of things Saturday night. Heres what happened:<br>
<br>
I was on my way to the bank after i just logged off as Sinu because I was giving Aaean a wedding gift to give to Paradym for me because it was a lore item I already had on me. I logged back on as Tidan and was running to the NFP zone from the WFP gate when a female "Rilian" sent me a tell. She said she was Kuroi and this was her new character. She even asked what I was doing with the guys tonight. I told her I was going to go to Kunark with Aaean, Vlandiil, Paradym, and Fitzroy. She said cool. She then asked if I could help her trade some items off of Kuroi onto this character, seeing I was on my way to the bank, and that I thought it was Kuroi,I agreed. <br>
<br>
Well we went to the bank where I was sorting through my items in the bank. I asked her to send Paradym a tell to see what type of earrings he had on. She asked if it was for the wedding and I said yes and that I just gave Aaean one gift to give to him and wanted to know what else to give to him. Well, she then asked about her wedding gifts, and seeing that Kuroi has been asking for them, I still had no reason to not think this wasnt Kuroi. I told her I had one of her presents on me. She mentioned the Runed Falchon and I told her no, that this one was mine. (Now, if you dont know, Kuroi has mentioned how much she liked my RF and wanted one, so I was going to get her one. In fact if I couldnt find another one, I was going to give her the one I was carrying). She then mentioned she had one on Kuroi for this cahracter along with some Silver Plated Leggings and 1000pp. She then mentioned that seeing I had a RF, SPL, and 1000pp on me, if I would give them to this character and she would then log on as Kuroi and port her over to FP because she had to come to the bank anyways. This would allow for her to get the items on the new character without having to keep logging on and off with Kuroi. <br>
<br>
I then noticed Kuroi talking in guild chat so I did a /who all Ne Plus Ultra to see who from the guild was on. I noticed that Kuroi and Cybiades were both on. This seemed a little strange to me and I asked her if she had another computer. She said yes she had 3 accounts and her sister was on the other computer as Kuroi and was going to teleport her over for her. Then she mentioned she was going to kick her sister off the computer because she was talking to much to the guild. She then asked if we could hurry up because she had to eat and feed the baby. So this once again made me believe it was indeed Kuori. <br>
<br>
But something inside me felt wrong so I told Rilian to hold on because I was doing some important talking. What I was doing was asking Paradym who Rilian was. He told me he knew but not to tell her. I told him I knew it was Kuroi. Then I asked him if he was sure it was Kuroi, and he said as far as he knew it was. Then Rilian asked me if I was talking to her sister who was playing Kuroi and I told her no. So I then proceeded to trade my SPL and RF with her. Then I got a really bad feeling and told Paradym I hope this is not a scam. (Something in me was bugging me about it, but everything she said was like the way Kuroi talked, even earlier when I told Rilian she looked good, she asked me if I didnt want her to wear armor. I told her no. She then said I would have to stay next to her all the time and take care of her and protect her, so I thought it was Kuroi). Well, Paradym then offered to ask Kuroi if that was her and I told him no because I didnt want to make her mad by thinking I didnt believe her. Well that was a mistake. Rilian then asked if I had 1000pp on me to trade also. I said sure and gave her the money. Rilian then told me she would be right back with Kuroi and to wait here. Rilian then logged off.<br>
<br>
I then asked Kuroi if she was on her way over. She didnt know waht I was talking about. Right there I was worried. Then I asked her if she was just on as Rilian in the bank with me, and she said no. This is the part where my heart sunk. I reliazed I was just scammed. I tried to send Rilian a tell but she was logged off. Then I told the guild in guild chat and sent a /petition to a GM. Then I noticed a Tykin selling SPL and RF. I sent a shout out on the zone mentioning I was just scammed and this worried a guy, cant remember his name. He told me he was about to buy the SPL from Tykin but he decided not to. He then told me to send a tell to the GM's. I had some trouble making it work so had the guild send some petitions for me. I then zoned into WFP and sent another petition successfully. Guide Rokko then asked me waht happened and I told him. He said there was a guy Tykin selling the same stuff and I told him I think its the same guy or someone who helpped him. I dont know what happened but I think he spoke with that guy then Rokko came back and told me he put my on the GM's list and she'd be with me as soon as she could but she was really busy. <br>
<br>
Well, I waited all night till I was falling asleep and didnt hear back from anyone. Then I got on Sunday and sent another petition and another Guide told me the Server GM was handling it and she was off till Tuesday and that I should send another petition on Tuesday, but she already had the original. Vlandiil also told me the same thing. The guide then told me this had been happening all week and she had busted a lot of people for scams like this one.<br>
<br>
So there, that should bring everyone up to speed on what happened to me. I would ask that everyone be very careful when doing trades especially between characters. Also, dont be like me, if you have a doubt, send that person or someone else a tell. If you still have a doubt, dont do the trade. Someone else in the guild can do it. I will tell you right now, if I dont know who you are and they are not in the guild, I will not be doing trades with them. I was stupid and got suckerd out of a lot of stuff.<br>
<br>
So everyone just be careful. If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone. This person knew way too much about the weddings and gifts to be just some jerk off the street. It "HAD" to be someone who knew me or someone else in the guild. I am not going to point fingers or try to blame anyone but myself, I just ask you be careful. I dont want this happening to anyone in the guild again.<br>
<br>
I hope the GM will do something on Tuesday. Dont know if she will and if nothing else I just hope the bust whoever did this to me. I will get my SPL again, and might even get my RF again. But I shouldnt have to. I cant believe people stoop so low in this game. I almost quit that night but the idea that this guy might get caught kept me on.<br>
<br>
Take care everyone. Ill see you IG.<br>

Damn, I had no idea that Rilian knew so much about us, about the guild... that is bad. I can see how it does look like an inside job, and damn I hope it isnt. if it does turn out to be inside the guild, I know that member will be disguilded the instant we find out, if thier account isnt cancelled. Post here what the GM had to say, the one that is supposedly working on it but not coming back till today, if anything was done. It just sickens me to think that it could be someone in guild, and I dont want to beleive it, but considering how much the person knew... (hmm, can a program like showeq or another show what is going on in guildchat? just something to think about....) <br>
<br>
<br>
keep us informed... <br>

The Server GM was not on at that time. I will log on today and see if she is on today. Hopefully something can be done about it but if not - oh well.<br>

wow, I hope you dont have to wait till the weekend... that is a long time. Seems like there are a few people running the scam, or one guy who has been real lucky, keep hearing about more and more people being scammed, or attempted to be scammed in the exact same way... damn, I hope they are caught real soon so we can get on with having fun...<br>

FWIW, I've placed a request for help on Renshai's message board as well. I know a few of them and we may get some positive feedback...<br>
