My question is, just how do those who play EQ so much function?<br>
<br>
If someone is in school full time how do you study and get good grades if you are playing EQ so much?<br>
<br>
If someone is employed full time, just how do you function in the work place?<br>

I've lived this way for the past 3 years, actually. Except 2 of those years were before I knew what &quot;EverQuest&quot; was. I swear, if a single person says &quot;omg its addicting&quot; im going to find you and beat your head in. If, as I was typing this, a box popped up showing EverQuest being deleted, I would shrug my shoulders and go back to sitting in IRC and playing Quake3, like I did before I got EQ. <p><BR>

As for me my schedule changes a lot but right now I work 3 days on 3 days off.  On days on I might play for 2 hrs if i am lucky.  Days off after I work out do things with the wife and just being in hawaii I prob play mabye 4-6 hrs on the 3 days off but that is when my wife is at work.  She hates me playin this game and I can see why, it is addicting.  This, onther than a brief stint in AC, is my first Online RPG.  Im the NHL, Madden sports kind of guy.<br>

<br>
Different people have different life circumstances.  Nowadays, I don't play video games as much as I used to, but back in high school it was a bit different.  I'd often get home from school, and head to the computer for my major addiction at the time, Starcraft.  I'd often play for 5+ hours, have dinner, do some homework, then go out for the evening.  Now, I wasn't a straight A student, but I managed to be fairly close to it.  Nowadays I can't get away with that sort of thing, but many of these people can.  Some people can't balance everything, so they choose EQ.  If EQ if what they enjoy in life then so be it. <p><hr>

As far as how people pass school and all that, the fact is some people are smart enough to get by in school doing very little work.  It's not really the way it should be done, but people do it.  You tell your professors what they want to hear, and pay attention in class so you have a feel for what sort of bullshit is going to fly, and you're all set.  Note that I'm not reccomending this, just saying that it can be and has been done. <p>Ahry - hero of Gaoth an Iar, Percival server <BR>

Is it even remotely possible I finish my homework in school? Yes. I don't get A's, but I'm very, very far from failing.<br>

Do I go out at night? No. Do I want to go out at night? No. I choose, because it is my right to have the choice, not to drink or smoke weed/hash. Almost everyone I know does one or the other (or both) most nights. In my opinion, playing EQ a lot won't make me as stupid as smoking a little weed.<br>

You just stated its not your to tell him what to do<br>
Fis can do what the hell he wants and when the hell he wants to. Why did you comment if you just stated its not your place to say it Hawaii? Hmm...lets think about that now? <p><center><img src="http://members.home.net/fitzpatr/Anasig2a.gif"></a></center>

I'll try to boil it down a bit.<br>
<br>
I'm going to try and ignore all that off topic BS...<br>
<br>
Different people have different life circumstances.  Some people can't balance everything, and so they choose EQ. If EQ is what they enjoy in life then so be it.<br>
<br>
I'd like to think that Muzaak's question as some merit to it, and wouldn't mind seeing some posts that don't involve you and Fisarik going at it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umoltaenyadmagmus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moltaenya D Magmus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#E9D756>(10/23/01 8:40:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /sigh</span><hr size=1> &quot;Wow Fis you must have an F in school. Your mother should spank you for not doing your homework.&quot; -Hawaii<br>
<br>
There are some people who actually get good grades because they listen in school and need not study, and get their schoolwork done relatively fast.  Yes I am one of these people who was able to do this, and it always bothered me how people assume that if you don't devote your life to that boring, destruction of life, hellhole known as school that they must not get good grades.<br>
<br>
Of course I was talking about highschool there - college is a little different story.  I know lots of people in game (gorn for example :P) who are in college, play EQ, and still get excellent grades.  <br>
<br>
Hawaii your mother should spank you for assuming things based on sterotypes.  /rude<br>
<br>
There is also this handy little command called /afk.  It simple let's other know that at some points during play they can't be *gasp* at their keyboard!<br>
