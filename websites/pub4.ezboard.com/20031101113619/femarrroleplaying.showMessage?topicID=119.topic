I had no recollection of my name, my age, my parentage…. Who was I?  Suddenly I saw a light coming towards me.  I surmised that it must be a lantern, as it swung back and forth as if carried by someone.  Slowly I began to make out a form… male, definitely male.  He appeared to be a warrior, as he wore a full set of brilliant blue armor.  He carried two swords, one on each hip, as if they were a part of him.  He walked easily, as if he had not a care in the world, but as he neared, I could see the weight of duty and responsibility in his face.  His face was lined, but not with age, rather with battle scars and worry.  He appeared one who knew his duty well and loved it, yet also who considered it a burden that he might never be rid of.<br>
<br>
“Vendui” he said to me.  “What means that?” I asked.  He explained that it was a greeting of his people, one used exclusively to those he considered friends.  “Why do you say this to me then?” I inquired.  “Any of the Drow are greeted as such” he said.  <br>
<br>
At this I looked down at myself.  “Drow?” I thought.  I looked up at him and asked, “who am I?”.  At this he seemed to become confused.  “You know not who you are?” he inquired.  “Ney” I said.  “I fear I have lost all recollection of my past..” At this I looked at the ground, feeling ashamed.  I knew not why, but I felt as if I was less of a person because of my inability to remember who I was.<br>
<br>
Reaching out, he tilted up my chin.  “Child” he said, “be not ashamed for I have come to make you one of us.”  At this I could only stare.  “One of who and why?  You know not who I am..” I said.  “I have felt the calling of a Sister  of the Shadow, you are that Sister.  You were meant be be one of us, The Cimmerii, The People of Shadow.  I have been sent by Innoruuk, God of all that is Hated, to bring you to your rightful place within The Cimmerii.  I am told that I am to be your mentor, your friend, and your confidant.  I am to help you remember who you are and to teach you the ways of the Indigo Brotherhood.”<br>
<br>
He looked at me and said quietly.. &quot;do you remember anything?&quot;  I looked at the ground, trying<br>
to come up with an answer. &quot;Lith....Lithi...Lithiano Kia'ahna&quot; I said quietly.  Looking shocked<br>
I gasped.  &quot;That's my name!!&quot; I said.  I can't believe it, I remember.  He continued to watch<br>
me, waiting for my next response.  &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said, &quot;that's all I can remember..&quot; Looking<br>
distraught I waited for the axe to fall.  I was not good enough for the group and knew it.<br>
&quot;Well Lady Lithiano, welcome to the Brotherhood of the Cimmerii, I hope that you will be happy<br>
with us.  I have but one request..&quot;  As I looked up into his face I knew that it was to be a<br>
request of monumental proportions, I had to make the right decision here or I would no longer<br>
be one of the People of Shadow.  &quot;You must swear fealty to The Cimmerii, once you are a<br>
Brother, you are not to join any other organization without express permission of the Cimmerii.<br>
You will not be anything but Cimmerii. This I ask as Leader and Commander of The Cimmerii.&quot;<br>
Saluting him crisply I said &quot;Sir, I am Cimmerii, till the day I leave this plane of existence,<br>
and beyond.”  He nodded at me and smiled slightly, “I know not if this is true for you, but many of us felt a calling to join with this guild.  You may not have a recollection of such an event, however we have not had a single member who has not felt it.   We come to the Cimmerii because we feel we belong with them, that is the way it has always been.   I hope that you feel that pull one day, tis quite something to behold.. Once you are fullblood, I am sure you will feel this attachment.”<br>
<br>
I kneeled down before him, saying “sir, I am yours to command, what do you wish of me?”  He looked don at me. “Rise Lady Lithiano,” he said “you are now an initiate of The Cimmerii, we bow to no one.  However, you must prove yourself worth to those who came before you.  Whey you have, you will truly be one of us.”  “Thank you,” I said, “I am honored.  What shall I do first?”<br>
<br>
“You will fulfill your initiate requirement by adventuring with my soul-brother.  He goes by the name of Ashrad and is a Cleric of Innoruuk.  He is a loyal Brother of The Cimmerii and hopes soon to also gain full status among us.  I believe that you two shall make a fine match.”<br>
<br>
“Aye Commander, as you wish,” I said “however, I have but one question…”  I looked up at him, wondering if he would allow me to ask it.  If he was anything, he was formidable and extremely intimidating, as I stood there, I wondered how many others had gone before me and stood in this spot waiting for an answer from him.  “Speak Lady Lithiano,” he said, “as your mentor and leader, I am bound to be at your service, what is it you wish to know?”<br>
<br>
“Sir” I said quietly “You know all that I remember about myself, my name, yet I do not know yours… might I ask what it is?”  “That you may” he said “tis Commander Aedeb Ka’Leem. “  “Thank you for your patience and kindness to me Commander, I hope that some day I can make you proud.  I shall do all that is in my power to uphold that that is Cimmerii.”<br>
<br>
At this he nodded slightly and pointed behind me.  “It is time to go M’lady, we have much work to do.  Your Brother Ashrad awaits you.”  “Aye sir” I said.  Turning slightly he strode off in the direction he had indicated.  I followed respectfully behind. “You have much to learn,” he said “tis now time to begin.”<br>

I have come to enlighten you all about myself, the God of Darkness...*cackle*<br>
<br>
OOC: A story I wrote while bored of RL. Keep in my mind: I'm an erudite necromancer from Paineel.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
It was foretold that a day would come that one would be born who with a mark. The mark of Hatred, the skull stained with blood. And he would accomplish that which was deemed impossible. He would be the Bringer of Truth, the Gift of the True Three, the Unifyer.<br>
<br>
And this day arrived and I was born…<br>
<br>
Born knowing…those of us branded as traitors by those who are ignorant. We are destined as the Priests of Thule, and they have granted us knowledge of our destinies at birth. And so, we are born knowing… knowing what lies before us, knowing what we must do, knowing about the True Three, knowing what others Fear to know… Our ignorant, misguided Brothers have banished us to this stinking hole because we know… the whole world has shunned us simply be cause we know the Truth…<br>
<br>
And as I lay in my coffin of a crib, I pondered and marveled at all that I knew and I knew then the reason for my being. That which must be fulfilled to allow the return of the True Three.<br>
<br>
And as the many years drifted by, my knowledge grew to be a terrible burden. I grew intolerant for fools, those who did not accept, and I would seclude myself for years to contemplate my grand task. And to prepare. I will not fail…<br>
<br>
And finally, the time had come…to leave this wretched hole, to unify my knowledge with long lost Soul Brothers. To seek others Blessed with Truth, those who knew the stuff others shrug off as nightmares. To band together a force of such magnitude this world has never seen.<br>
<br>
And as I set off, I knew this was my rebirth, He had shown me that which had been hidden to everyone and I saw clearly. I must now leave my old life to begin one of unimaginable proportions.<br>
<br>
And so I began my momentous journey. And as I crept under cover of night, I once again marveled at that which I knew, and as I passed the ignorant cretins, sleeping in what they thought of as safe homes, a silly thing really, I knew that a day would come when they too would accept the Truth.<br>
<br>
And many years passed as I searched and He guided to the place of meeting and at last, I found it. This was the place, the place where it would all begin, where lies and fairy tales would be swept away, where Truths became clear. And all this was in my mind as I wearily walked into the open from the shadows that had concealed me for decades.<br>
<br>
&quot;Halt! Who goes there?&quot; A guard demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I seek the Blessed Ones, those that call themselves, People of Shadows…the Cimmerii.&quot; I replied ominously. A sudden rage then filled me and I glared at him with burning Hatred from beneath my shrouded hood. My face tingling strangely. As my eyes bored into his, I saw his face contort into that of Terror, &quot;Who…who…what are you?&quot; He stammered.<br>
<br>
&quot;They call me…Bloodyskull.&quot; <p><center><table style='Filter: Shadow(Color=#150517, Direction=225)'><tr><td><span class='longlivethecimmerii!!evilforalleternity...'><font color=red><i>LONG LIVE THE CIMMERII!! Evil for All Eternity...</span></td></tr></table></font></i>
