<br>
   I can say you have lost any clout, any backing to your beliefs by the simple fact that you stooped to the level you so rabidly denounce.  Simple as that.  <br>
<br>
As for some other things.<br>
<br>
1)  lets not have any misconceptions here.  I think for myself,and myself a lone.  I may agree or disagree with folks from time to time, but it is completly my own doing.  You have this perception that I am attacking you because others are. Personally, I dont know these others, they don't know  me, and I could care less what their problems with you are.<br>
<br>
2) My &quot;attacks&quot; as you so feel to put it,  were (up until recently) to try as hard as I could to show you where the misconceptions could be coming from,  well I failed, and that is fine.<br>
<br>
3) You say the only thing we agree on is Raed,  I beg to differ, I believe I agreed with you on a book or an author in another thread...  =)  so you were wrong there.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now Chit.   For the longest time,  I felt you were pompous, pretentious, crazy.. if not insane, an a general all around wacko.   As do many others.   Your crusade that you kept talking about didn't seem to make sense, it seemed flighty at best, because you were so wrapped up in what kerryn, dwark and the others were saying and doing that you never really clearly stuck to your crusade and its purpose.  It seemed to morph into whatever that days events would allow it to.<br>
<br>
Then you made your post about what it was all about.  That was cool.  I read it, read it again,  read it 4 times totally I think to make sure I didn't miss anything and I then went around to other threads to read stuf while I was formulating a response.  <br>
  <br>
    Your &quot;crusade&quot; had more validity to it after that.  You had a hard time in the game,  exactly why.. not sure,  but you had a hard time.   Personally, I have met many many members from the &quot;uber&quot; guilds and have never had a problem.  See, I am who I am and if ya like it great if ya don't, it's just as well and for the most part it goes the other way.   Cheaters, abusive folks, problem children . . they exist, but I personally have not had all that many run ins with them,  and in general have not heard it afflicting too many folks quite as bad as it seems to have affected you,  and that too is fine.<br>
<br>
     Do I condone it?  Nah.   Do I embrace it?  Nah  Do I make a big stink about it?  Nah.  Because ultimatly,  the end game... it doesnt matter.  It really doesnt.  That however is up to you.  If you let it get to you, then it will,  if you don't then it won't.   There is nothing anyone can say that will change the fact .. it is only a game.  Anyone who thinks otherwise has some issues.  Why?  Because you can turn it off.<br>
<br>
    So,  we differ on the level of importance of the abusiveness (As do many folks who have answered you) but we  do not differ on the fact that they are there, and it is bad, and it can suck.  The only problem I can see is that because folks don't feel as passionatly about it as you do,  they are considered bad people.   That is wrong.<br>
<br>
   Again, so, was goign to do a long post about your explanation,  with some apologies even,  but then I see your attack in the just frustrating thread.   I am lead to believe there is another in another thread but have not gone to that one.<br>
<br>
   This is where I personally feel you have lost.  This is also where you show that what Kerryn says/does is important to you, important enough that you can't ignore.<br>
<br>
    You thrash, and you trash these guys because they &quot;post stalk&quot; you.  Well fine,  let them.  I Have had folks follow me around and post stalk me as well,  ya know something,  I see one of those, I recognize it for what it is, and it is ignored.  Not you though,  you make a HUGE deal out of it.<br>
<br>
    Why don't people get on Kerry and the others for doign it,  because most likely it is seen for what it is, a private beef and it is ignored..  Why do people get on you for it?  Because you make this holier than though attempt to bring it to everyones attention and turn the world against them.  Do you really think people dont like you because kerryn, carathos and dwarkem dont like you?  That is giving them a WHOLE lot of power.  I for one (and I have said this before)  have no like or dislike for you.  You are a poster.  I have agreed with you on things,  and I have not on others.  I would bet a lot of the others who you feel &quot;are against you&quot; because of these guys are the same way.<br>
<br>
    You don't mean that much to us to like or dislike.  There are some who I truly do NOT like, they know who they are, they know who I am, but I dont sit and dwell on it, nor do I go out of my way to tell them. <br>
<br>
    I can tell ya though,  by stooping to the level of action that you so passionatly condemn, does NOT win you many brownie points.   It makes you a hippocrate.  I am sure you will argue that but anyone who says &quot;thing a is bad&quot;  then goes and &quot;does thing a&quot;  is a hippocrate plain and simple.  That does not help your case at all.  It does also reduce validity in your stance.  I dont care of this Nuldar whoever he is person said you could or not.  That doesnt make it right.  Hell, that is as childish a reaction as I have ever seen.  why bring him into it anyway,  be an adult and do what you think is right, which apparently is &quot;fighting fire with fire&quot; but not without asking daddy for acceptance.<br>
<br>
    Have your crusade, fight your crusade. Your reasons for that are just in your soul so go for it.  However,  I dont recall any of the history books saying Joan of Arc, or King Arthur, or any historical figure who had a goal that others disagreed in EVER standing up and saying..<br>
<br>
    &quot;I have my purpose, and it is good,  but everyone condemn that group of people because they are calling me names and making my life hard.&quot;  Usually they either killed those who disagreed, or they just ignored them, being sound in their belief and secure in their purpose.<br>
<br>
   Now, I cannot advocate or even suggest that the previous reaction is a correct course or even a SANE one,  but ignoring them really isnt' that hard, and would surely knock off a lot of the playground bickering.<br>

The people like Raedwulf, who post stalk, do not go to Nuldar and clear it with him.<br>
They just do it.<br>
<br>
It should be clear, that because I did do that, it troubles me greatly. It is not something I wish to do.<br>
<br>
However: If he is doing it to me, and YOU dont complain about it, with the same verve you complain about it here. Then YOU Skerry are guilty of the same<br>
Hypocrisy. In fact, we can settle it RIGHT NOW just us two.<br>
<br>
I will stop RIGHT NOW, if every time he does that you flame him for it.<br>
Agreed?<br>
<br>
You see, he could simply leave ME alone also, could he not?<br>
I am sure you realize there are very few threads I haunt. I simply dont have time.<br>
I dont have interest.<br>
<br>
He comes to me. Not me to him. He seeks the confrontation, not me.<br>

   Will the madness end? If you are as big a person as you say, and profess to be, why not just be the honorable person and put an end to it?<br>
<br>
   Somehow I get the feeling that you believe that this is a race. That if you get the last post you win? I dont know Kerryn, have read his posts. I think ( and yes, I am with Skerry here. I speak for myself and myself alone. ) that he is right on the money in some places, and completely wacked in others. You are the same. Sometimes your posts are intelligent. You book comments in another thread were good. I actually picked out some books and I am reading them now. Sometime its very obvious that you had been hiking and there was some kind of oxygen deprivation going on. Unfortuantely lately, I have been leaning more on the side of oxygen deprivation.<br>
<br>
   I dont post here often, and I am sure that I will get some kind of flame for this, but I just have to get this out. I know I am posting and elicting a response from you. but the content of the response could be &quot;You know your right. I dont like Kerryn, plan and simple. I have stated it and I am done&quot; or it could be &quot;I believe you are wrong on the following posts so therefor I will continue. &quot;<br>

I don't know you especially well Chiteng but I can read, from what I read I draw the conclusion that you are indeed a very intelligent man.. quite probably more intelligent than I.  That being said I find this an unacceptable answer.  <br>
<br>
Actually no I don't feel especially picked on, but that is no reason for you not to take the time to spell my name correctly... you obviously know who I am since you attempt to address me rather than just addressing an open forum and thus I can conclude that you see my name on the posts I write, therefore you know how to correctly spell my name.<br>

What could I possibly gain from mispelling your name?  I have a firm grasp of the english language, I can read and I can type quite well.  I have no medical impediments that may cause me to mispell things accidentally or otherwise, perhaps a lack of knowledge with regard to spelling some complex words but that's about it.  To start calling you names serves no purpose to me or my cause.<br>

Unacceptable.. my post name (Feldynn) is spelt correctly and my character name (Feldynn Soerbaird) is quite evident in my signature at the end of each of my post.

No, I will not go away simply if you prove me wrong for the first time.  This petty &quot;what if&quot; scenario you've played with  Dwarkarn and I before is childish.  I will continue to hold you to the fire for your foolishness, paranoia and prevarication.<br>

However, if you can provide some evidence for what you say about Nuldar, I will gladly admit to my error.
