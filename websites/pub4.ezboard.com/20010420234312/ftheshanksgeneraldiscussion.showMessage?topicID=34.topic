I told him that this was only temporary.  Recently he and Rowenna have been getting upset with me because I would not invite their friends immediatly into the guild.  I told them that we had to agree on the procedure first, then through due process members would be admitted. <BR>  <BR> Here is the exact conversation: <BR>  <BR> Blye: Do you mind if I take off the officer tag?  I think we got all the members that are gonna show.  Unless you need it. <BR> Ulthien: I think I better keep it. <BR> Blye: Why's that? <BR> (Long Pause) <BR> Blye: I am sorry, but we agreed to not have any officers until after the arena battle. <BR> (Removed Ulthien from the guild) <BR> (Reinvite Ulthien to the guild 6 times) <BR> Blye to Ulthien: Join in <BR> (Reinvite Ulthien to the guild) <BR> Blye to Ulthien: Why won't you join in? <BR> (Reinvite Ulthien to the guild 2 times) <BR> Blye in guildspeak: I think I pissed off Ulthien somehow <BR> Rowenna in guildspeak: Not only him. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: I gave him guild officer status a while back to help me recruit members.  I told him I was gonna remove it.  So I took it off, now he won't join the guild for some reason. <BR> Farquar in guildspeak: I don't see why you need to remove it.  He's a good officer, and a good member of the guild. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: Well, we agreed not to have officers till after the arena battle.  Those were the agreed upon guild laws.  I told him it was only temporary. <BR> Rowenna in guildspeak: You resigned him.  and he really don't need your kid bullshits. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: I had to take off the officer tag.  I reinvite him, but he won't join. <BR> Roewnna in guildspeak: and he really don't need your childish bullshit. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: What is childish about this? <BR> Rowenna in guildspeak: of course and that's not only one person who is out, i'm out too. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: All I want to do is make a guild that works well <BR> Rowenna in guildspeak: goodbye Shanks <BR> Blye in guildspeak: If you object to me, kill me in the arena. <BR> Rowenna in guildspeak: It was nice to meet all except Blye. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: Don't ruin the guild because you disagree with me. <BR> Rowenna in guildspeak: I'm not killing kids Blye.  Sorry I'm mother of my kid and I'm not going to take care of other kids, my kid is enough for me.  Blye, this IS just a game pal.  There just wen't two of it's best members. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: And I did nothing wrong. <BR> (Rowenna leaves the guild) <BR> Blye in guildspeak: I told Ulthien when i gave him officer status that it was only temporary.  The guild agreed to give officer status to those who used to be leaders.  How would it be fair to make a special exception for Ulthien?  If he takes this personally, I'll let him be an officer. <BR> Farquar in guildspeak: Well maybe so, but I'd like to point out that Ulthien seems to be on quite a bit more than you. <BR> Blye in guildspeak: ok, what does that have to do with anything? <BR> Farquar to Blye: Look, this is just a game.  nice to have rules and all, but you shouldn't piss people off like that. <BR> Blye to Farquar: I did nothing to piss anyone off.  I told him ahead of time that the officer tag was temporary. <BR> Blye to Ulthien: What is wrong?  You can be an officer, is that what's wrong? <BR> Ulthien to Blye: No I'm fed up with your obsession with &quot;title&quot; <BR> Blye to Ulthien: My obsession?  I wan't you in the guild.  You can be an officer. <BR> Ulthien to Blye: Aye I don't like ppl that are egocentrical.  I DON'T need to be an officer, it's a matter of TRUST. <BR> Blye to Ulthien: What? <BR> Ulthien to Blye: It's pure administrativer.  You showed me you DON'T TRUST ME. <BR> Blye to Ulthien: How is me removing you from being an officer make me egotistical?  I trust you, but there is no need for you to be an officer.  I will let you be one now that I see you really want it. <BR> Ulthien to Blye: You enjoy playing might over others.  Even for unimportant issues, which make you maybe important in your own eyes. <BR> Blye to Ulthien: Yeah right <BR> Ulthien to Blye: No I DON'T.  So much I won't accept any invite. <BR> Blye to Ulthien: I offered to give up the leader spot right after I won it.  Do you want to be leader?  I'll let you lead the guild. <BR> Ulthien to Blye: Titles don't count, just trust and friendships. <BR> Blye to Ulthien: What will make you happy?  I trust you, just can't do special favors for anyone. <BR> Ulthien to Blye: np bye <BR> Blye to Ulthien: We agrees that the officers would only be past leaders. <BR> Ulthien to Blye: Good night it's late over here <BR> Blye to Ulthien: So you don't want to lead the guild? <BR> Ulthien to Blye: No <BR>  <BR>  <BR> </font><P>Leader of the Shanks, until I get killed or you find somebody better...<P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#a8a8a8><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uiamwotan.showPublicProfile>I am Wotan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Global user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>1/13/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>7:44:13 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Ulthien and Rowenna have left the guild</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Argggh!

We cant afford to lose core players or the whole thing will collapse.   <BR>  <BR> Text based communication is dicey.  I've read psychological analyses and the gist is that it is extremely prone to misinterpretation, and it somehow bypasses many defense mechanisms that we have developed for face-to-face interaction. <BR>  <BR> I don't doubt that what you did was well-intentioned, but Ulthien has a point and I would be offended as well.  Its one of the reasons my primary character is guildless at 26. <BR> The whole thing is moot anyway.  Anyone Ulthien or Rowenna would invite has an automatic rubber-stamp approval from me, Loge, and Fricka.  Thats 5 shanks right there.   <BR>  <BR> I'm gonna pressure Ulthien and Rowenna hard to come back, hehe can you say email spam ;-).

ALL disputes are to be settled by the ways of our people and not harsh words. No side is right in this situation.

Settle your differneces in the COB.  <BR>   <BR> Blye silently offer Ulthien his membership back non-stop. If you see him invite him instantly. If you two have no brotherly words for eachother at that time simply go your own ways then. I want no more activity like this. Please.   <BR>   <BR> Our ancestors are screaming in my ears.
