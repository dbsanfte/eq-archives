&quot;...Professor J. C. Hurewitz, writes: &quot;The demise of the Ottoman Empire, in fact, 'resolved' the Eastern question.  Yet while BRITAIN and France inherited the political controls they significantly DID NOT ANNEX Near and Middle East territory outright.&quot;<br>
<br>
The British did not annex the land of Palestine. They did not own it. Private lands remained in private hands.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The report noted in the strongest terms the effect on indigenous Palestinians of Zionist policies.<br>
&quot;The effect of the Zionist colonization policy on the Arab.  Actually the result of the PURCHASE of land in Palestine by the Jewish National Fund has been that land has been extraterritorialized.&quot;<br>
<br>
Purchase. Of land. And since the British did not own it, they did not sell it. Someone else did.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;... When at last they came before us, headed by the Mufti of Jerusalem...at the close of his statement he stated that the first cause of the 'disturbances' was 'the fact that the Arabs in Palestine were deprived of their natural and political rights'; and he summed up the Arab demands as...(3) 'the immediate and complete prohibition of the SALE of Arab land to Jews'...&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm. Who is doing the selling here? Not the Brits, they don't own it. Not the Jews, they're buying it. Out of suspects.<br>
<br>
<br>
From MERIP, a non-partisan research group:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.merip.org/palestine-israel_primer/brit-mandate-pal-isr-prime.html">www.merip.org/palestine-i...prime.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;In the 1920s, when the Jewish National Fund PURCHASED large tracts of land FROM ABSENTEE ARAB LANDOWNERS, the Arabs living in these areas were evicted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Absentee. Fucking. Landowners. <br>
<br>
In this case, called Arabs, which is somewhat accurate, as I've stated that Palestinians did some of the selling themselves.<br>
<br>
Alas, I have been unable to establish that the majority of the landowners in Palestine were in fact Turkish nationals living in Palestine. Yet. I didn't look for actual books today. However, in my first quote, you'll note that the Brits didn't annex the land.<br>
<br>
It remained in the same hands it had been in since Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.<br>
<br>
Absentee. Fucking. Landowners. Arabs, according to MERIP. Arabs and Turks according to me. Moslems, regardless.<br>
<br>
They sold it, legally, to the Jews.<br>
<br>
If you insist that I continue looking for proof of Turkish possession, I will. For no other reason than to show you just what a reactionary, uneducated fuck you truly are.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day. I'm going to go eat thai and drink beer.<br>

You threw in the 'Turk' thing to try to make yourself look intelligent.  I am sure that if you look hard enough, you will find some irrelevent piece of literature that makes some sort of half-ass attempt to connect the Turks to Palestine.  You'll probably end up just making it up.<br>
<br>
The fact is, that's not important.  The jist of my entire argument is that the Jews don't deserve that land.  They deserved something back then, but now, Israel (Apartheid part deux) deserves shit.<br>
<br>
I wish the American East Coast were thrown out of their homes, raped, and fed shit by Jews relocated there after the Holocaust.  Perhaps your view would change dramatically, nimwit.  How does it feel to be so incredibly stupid?  Make up some more lies about Palestinian family members as well, that's a good one.  I haven't met one Palestinian who shares the views you do....I hope *they* see this thread and spit in your worthless, uneducated face, you piece of shit.<br>
<br>
Warangel:<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>This much I will acceed to though. You can't have a nation of people without a home. No one in the middle east wants to give them a home (Jordan tried and wound up in a war with the PLO in 1973), and indeed most appear to be more interested in turning them into suicide bombers. It's also apparent that they cannot co-exist with Israel. They need to be relocated someplace where they are of no danger to themselves or anyone else, given some decent land to call their own, and allowed to rebuild something of value if they are capable.<br>
</font color><br>

Hey ass, there is only one group of people that needs to be relocated out of that area.  The group that doesn't belong.  Fuck yourself repeatedly, rinse, repeat.  I hate dealing with bigot-faced, racist fuckheads like you two.<br>

&quot;The fact is, that's not important.  The jist of my entire argument is that the Jews don't deserve that land.&quot;<br>

Given that the absentee landowners SOLD them the land that they don't deserve, I'd say the jist of your argument is fucked. Along with your credibility, not that you had any.<br>

<br>
They had an enormous part in educating me on the subject. They live here for a reason, you snivelling piece of filth.<br>
<br>
They live here because, over there, it's infested with hate-spouting, lying maggots such as yourself. They're ashamed of people like you, Miblis. An entire culture infected by loathsome people looking for any excuse to blame others for their misfortunes.<br>
<br>
From Sumer, to Egypt, to Phoenicia, to Persia, to the Caliphate...glorious civilizations of learning and light...<br>
<br>
...consumed by vicious rats who only know how to thump the Koran, scream for violence and field-strip an AK-47.  <br>
<br>
Manuscripts millenia-old crumble to dust in the cities, while the leaders haggle for 40-year old Soviet weapons and steal from UN charity. A dark age.<br>
<br>
Why should they agree with you, Miblis? You're everything that's wrong with the place. You're a disgrace to them. Shit, you don't even know who the fucking Ottomans were, and you don't live in a refugee camp.<br>
<br>
Sadly, you're not even man enough to carry the gun for your beliefs. You just come on the internet and get embarrassed by people with a better education.<br>

No, I didn't say that's what happened. Christ, you can't even have an ezboard thread without revising what's been said, no wonder books scare you. <br>
<br>
I said: 'You know...the Turks? Ottoman Empire, used Palestine as a share-cropping toilet for centuries? Sold you out.'<br>
<br>
I never said anything about the Holocaust, or time frames. Try and keep up here, Miblis. <br>

<br>

&quot;Prove it, or its both you and Warangel1 who are twisting history for your advantage.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why? Everytime I beat you, you just scream and shout that I'm lying. My sources are impeccable, unlike yours. But you just claim otherwise. <br>
<br>
Miblis...you hate. Your hate is grounded in your knowledge. But when that knowledge is questioned and debunked, the motives for your hate become doubtful.<br>
<br>
Without your Jew-baiting hatred, what are you? Not much, I suspect. And so you'll refuse to accept anything as 'proof'. <br>
<br>
You've claimed the Jews had American aid in 1947, and have failed utterly to provide anything that supports it. You claimed that the land wasn't sold, and when I showed otherwise, you just started throwing insults.<br>
<br>
You're talking out of your ass, and you're a waste of time.<br>
<br>
With that said, if I get around to it, I'll find and post the data, noly because I said I would. I suspect it will only be found in Israeli archives, since they're the only ones with the motive to have the documents. But you'd just refer to them as Zionist lies, so why should I bother?<br>
<br>
No proof will ever be enough for you to believe that you're wrong, Miblis. Your low self-esteem won't allow it.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh another thing Kytherion and Warangel1....you never read the previous threads I have been involved in, or else you would truly see my beliefs.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've seen your beliefs in the other threads. You hate people you've never met, who have done nothing to you. You hate them for things you've heard they've done...and in this thread I've made you look like a jackass for some of those assumptions.<br>
<br>
You're a self-righteous, sad little fuck who would much rather believe what he prefers to be true, rather than what the evidence suggests is likely. I'm willing to bet that your dislike of Israel is a central theme in your life, and that you've probably never even seen more than a couple Israelis. Doesn't get much sadder than that.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;They do, however, deserve to be shipped off to an Island where they can practice Apartheid on wildlife animals rather then real people.&quot;<br>
<br>
So you'll enforce Apartheid on them, because you've HEARD they practice it? Miblis, if I lived around people like you, I'd want you kept the fuck away from my family too.

I am quite perceptive, and I certainly won't let THIS one go, bigot.<br>
<br>
<font color=yellow>"You're stupid, to put it bluntly. Now, being that the Israelis were too weak, too unorganized, and too ignorant, they couldn't just 'take' Palestine.

<font color=yellow><b>Great Britain hands someone elses country to the Israelis, because of the Holocaust.</b> You obviously don't see a problem with this, because you two are both highly ignorant individuals.

<br>
One of two things is happening here, Kytherion.  Either one you don't know how to read, or you like changing your story to support your views.<br>
<br>
Perhaps...perhaps it was an accident that you missed that first part....that makes sense in your original post....but does it make sense now that we are nearly 50 posts deep?  No, it doesn't.<br>
<br>
You are changing your story.  You want to keep your family away from me?  I want to keep my family away from you, just for how incredibly ignorant you are.  Who in the hell taught you how to read?  I am being dead serious here, I am not trying to diss you.  Who taught you how to comprehend?  Do you have any common sense at all?<br>
<br>
Also, if you intentionally tried to change your story to support your views, which I believe is the case, do you think I am so incredibly stupid that I can't go back and find it myself?<br>
<br>
You try to make me look like the idiot here, then you do this crap.  Who is looking stupid Kytherion?  YOU are looking stupid.<br>
<br>
Oh and another thing, jackass.....you didn't read any of the other threads I have been involved in.<br>
<br>
I do not hate Jews.  I hate the Israeli government.  Yes, I HATE the Israeli government.  I hate Israelis who SUPPORT the Israeli government.  Do I hate Jews?  Nope.  I never, ever claimed that.  I have Jewish friends, much like you have so-called Palestinian family.<br>
<br>
You are a liar.  You never paid attention to any of my previous threads, and I just proved once again that you are incompetent.  Seriously, how does it feel to be proven wrong?<br>
<br>
As far as no United States help for Israel post WWII.....you and Warangel1 should find something stating that U.S. never aided them....don't find me literature of what countries did aid them.  That's beside the point, anyway...the point is that no one should have helped them.  They can do things for themselves, apparently, the U.S. doesn't need to support them now, and never needed to support them then.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Apartheid....yeah....Palestinians live under occupation of Israelis.  South African natives lived under occupation of the Brits.  That might be a basic explanation, but it is an explanation nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Apparently with your logic, Mandela is also garbage, right?  Do you now, suddenly, hate blacks Kytherion?  Would not surprise me one bit.<br>

Yeah, I'm so ignorant I kicked your ass in this debate. Keeping your family away from people like me will just serve to engender the same ignorance and hatred you possess. Good work, slick. Strike a blow for the homies. We won't buy into their Zionist lies!<br>

Come on, you don't have to give up, Kytherion.  I mean you have some...um...good points...yeah.  Like uh.....wait no, you lied about the Turk thing.....you still don't take into consideration the hard fact of Great Britain handing Jews Israel.....um...what good point did you come up with....<br>
<br>
.....hmm, you did come up for a good reason why the United States is helping Israel now...wait, no...you didn't come up with a reason.<br>
<br>
What have you accomplished?  Nothing.  The one important point you came up with, which was WHO gave Israel the land after WWII...ended up being false.<br>
<br>
You should be either a politician or a lawyer, you're quite good at this whole 'lying' thing.<br>
<br>
I admit though, if you give up...at least you are being a man about it.  Dig more into this to try to make a point for the United States backing Israel, or anyone backing Israel for that matter, and it shows how much more of a pussy YOU are.<br>
<br>
Oh and your citations?  They mean absolutely nothing to me.  Once again, I am not concerned with anything pre-WWII.  The pure, hard fact of that matter was that after WWII, people felt SORRY for the Jews, rightfully so.....but decided to make them feel better, they should THROW Palestinians out...literally...of their homes, and let the Jews move in.  Period.  There is absolutely NO argument there, because it happened.  You can find plenty of literature at your local library of that.  Jews mass-murdered Muslims, and Muslims also took shots at Jews, to DEFEND themselves.  See, its this simple fact that you cannot comprehend.  You think that the Jews are constantly on the underside and are always the ones treated like shit...and throughout history, that may be true in some instances.  It's not true now, and the Jews don't have a Free Pass to do whatever they please because they have been victims throughout history.<br>
<br>
They don't have no fucking free pass.  If the United States truly did not think the Arabs should have any land at all, Bush wouldn't have even mentioned that.  That is my personal opinion, and not a fact.  Maybe Bush is a heartless liar like his father.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand, are another victim of the media.  Congratulations.<br>

First post about this.<br>
<br>
Before i start, let me make some points clear:<br>
<br>
1- I don't hate Jews, i have nothing against them, i never dealt with them, and i wish them the best in life.<br>
<br>
2- I utterly dislike the 'zionist' Israeli goverment ( why? i see the news every day! i'll attach an article i read today at the end of my post. Also, MY version of history states what they did differently than yours)<br>
<br>
3- I'll be totally civil while discussing this, please no insults or such.<br>
<br>
4- My mind is not really organized, so I might have some wrong-sounding quote's in here, do take that easily, and ask about them and i'll clarify later.<br>
<br>
5- This is a very long winded post, so please, if you want to discuss it, try reading all i said - trust me, i read yours. Any point not discussed I'll believe it considered valid by your <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ok, with that out of the way let me go through this:<br>
<br>
I think that the country known as Israel MUST exist, but, NOT in the place where it is now. More coming.<br>
<br>
Miblis and Kyth are both right and wrong in the same time. Both state what they believe as facts, and both are defending it woth strongheadedness that rival a drunken dwarf's. I support Miblis's princibles (sp?) , yet go with some of the evidence of what Kyth says, because it is true. While <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  true </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> . it is exaggerated and has its implications twisted to support his own view point. Arranging the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  true </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> events of history to brew a story that fits what you want to believe should not be taken as utter fact.<br>
<br>
Now, enough critisism, let me start how <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know those events are ( sorry if i am throwing ideas as i go along ) :<br>
<br>
- Ottoman Empire created long long ago, it works, dominates the whole region, for a long long time. Not many problems ( might be, but are mostly irrevelant for our discussion).<br>
<br>
- As time passes, Ottoman empire falls into the deepest pits of corruption, and loses all its ethics and morality, turning them into tyranny and such ( don't most of them go that way?)<br>
<br>
- The Ottoman Rulers divine the 'lands' all over the countries they 'own'. They take 'royalties' as 'absentee' owners. People can't do much about it in most places, people revolt and all that, all over the place. Still, those 'absentee' land owners still are pretty much the owners.<br>
<br>
- More time passes, World War I erupts, millions and millions die, and the Ottoman Empire falls down, the 'sick man' dies.<br>
<br>
- Britain, France, Germany and others split up the war spoils, thousands and thousands of fertile ground ( Erm, i meant  ''Yet while BRITAIN and France inherited the political controls they significantly DID NOT ANNEX Near and Middle East territory outright'') Right, Annex, not 'dominate' or 'rule'. ( see how a story can be 'twisted' to suit the teller's purpose?) <br>
<br>
- Palastine, under the control of Britain, has more jews than ever being let into the place. Their  % of the population increases. Now, more trouble emerge, but are sort of limited. Jews lived in the area for ages ( 1400 years i  can  verify, to a limit) with no significant trouble. As more jews come in, more  trouble brews ( while somewhat tolerable, they are significant and are filed to be used against palastinees later!).<br>
<br>
- Some what stable, life continues, some unrest against the British rule ( erm, observation? annexation? what do you want to name it?) More jews come in.<br>
<br>
-World War II starts, the inhumane, evil and vile 'Holocaust' ( look at other threads to see what i think about killing innocents <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) happens. Lots of innocent jews die. Britain is fed up with the trouble it has to deal with in Palastine. The 'Promise of Belfor ( sp? ) ' is promised, and the start of the Israeli country solidifies.<br>
<br>
- The Israeli Goverment starts, and the stuff from the UN dictates Palastinies must give half ( more? less? ) their land ( their land? owned by who? what and where?) to Israel.<br>
<br>
- Meanwhile, Jews start ( or keep on , however it might be) buying land, in huge amounts, from both Ottoman 'absentee' owners and Palastinee land owners outside Israel. The land 'deeds' of Palastinee people are considered 'invalid' according to the Israeili goverment, and are valueless. Folks are Evicted.<br>
<br>
- Arabs dislike that land takeover ( they too, have been 'liberated' from British annexation ...erm... rule). Some of them ( 5 countries are stated above) unite and fight the tiny young country of Israel. They lose, and lose, and lose.<br>
<br>
- The Israel country stands in the blood of thousands, till now ( see? i make em sound bad -wither they are or not- as you did make palastiniees sound bad. Story telling ).<br>
<br>
<br>
That's the story line how <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  see it.  Now, let's delve deeper into the points raised in this huge thread.<br>
<br>
- Lands sold by 'absentee' turk landlords ( whatever-when, does not matter when they sold it) and by the palastinee owners outside 'Palastine'.<br>
<br>
You give utter legitimacy to those sales. For you, it is a buy and sell transaction. Those sales DID happen. I dispute their validity  in two ways, a 'legal' way and a 'moral' way.<br>
<br>
Legal way: Why did  the Israeli goverment accept those sales ( from absentees no less) and consider their deeds valid and then chose to discard the deeds of the local palastinees? The fact that this happened is relatively provable, I am now looking for the person who can help me do it.  What does this double approach tell you? Why do i pick a thing when it helps me and discard it when its against me?<br>
<br>
Ethical way: Jews bought the lands from those who have no right to it ( if you think an occupier who owns land without paying for it or seeing it, who takes royalties just because is all right...that would tell me what kind of person you are).<br>
Israel's goverment validated that, and evicted ( and butchered and and and) the people who where on those lands...<br>
<br>
Done with that till i think of more, now to more points:<br>
<br>
Let's keep with what Kyth said. <br>
<br>
''Purchase. Of land. And since the British did not own it, they did not sell it. Someone else did.''<br>
<br>
Fine, let's assume we grant you that point. It directly leads us to another. Let's assume i bought 95% of the landscape in hte state of florida (Just an example, insert any name of any state/province, place in any place in the world ). Does that give me the right to bring my own goverment and do what i want in that area?<br>
<br>
If yes, tell me if you like it done to you  :/  . If no, then how did the Israeli goverment go up if not after Britain's promise ( before you tell me UN decided, tell me WHO the UN is, what big countries can 'veto' any of its decisions and who they support) granted it to them? <br>
<br>
Without Britain's promise and its denied 'support' ( them UN and the sort ) , how could the purchase of that land (which is still sort-of disputed, look above) legalize the eviction, massacres, and the institution of a goverment on that land?<br>
<br>
Ok, i'll keep going your way. Let's assume the land DID belong to them, let's assume Israel DOES have some sort of right to exist in that particular place. Why are they so...evil? Why are the massacres they do are ok, while what's happens against them is terrorism?<br>
<br>
If you review the parts of Israel's history that you ( and the 'capitalist' , 'profiteering' media ) ignore, you'll find it far more bloody than what you think.<br>
<br>
Those are the main points i have for now, I'll go for a few stray points from all over the thread:<br>
<br>
Kyth, you claim your sources are 'impeccable'. I am sorry, but i found that really funny ( in a twisted sort of way). If you really think those who wrote your 'history' and your 'documents' are utterly and completely honest and un-biased, that they won't twist the events themselves to suit what they like and want, then i really pity you.  <br>
<br>
History, my friend, is written by men. Men, tend to be biased, and some extermely biased. Men, tend to hate looking at what they did, and strive to change it. <br>
<br>
I know i cannot prove what i say, and i truly don't trust what's written by the 'victor' to suit thier purpose. I try to look at the whole picture, and filter if through a moral stance.<br>
<br>
If you think Israel should be what it is todya, do you want that put upon yourself and your family and friends? evicted, butchered and killed, removed from lands you had centuries ago because someone that never saw the place had a deed he didn't pay a bit for was validated by those who want the land?<br>
<br>
I'd like to hear what you said.<br>
<br>
One last point, you say that 5 arab nations fought a young, a very young israel and lost while having far superior equipement and numbers without American/British/international support?<br>
<br>
Really, how could that rationally and logically happen? How could  the Israeli army ( which, as you say is inferiorly equipped and with less warriors) win against them all, without support?<br>
<br>
The 'Arab' armies were vast, with endless soldiers ( compared to Israel's). Even if the Israeili' commands were supreme military genius's, they can't just 'defeat' those masses alone.<br>
<br>
I'll post a nice little article about Israel and terrorism in general on a separate post, following this one.<br>
<br>
It also answer's Trench's question about 'mindless slaughter'.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the lingwinded post, let's discuss, and keep it civil! <br>
<br>

<br>
JAMES O. GOLDSBOROUGH / THE SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE<br>
Overuse obscures the term 'terrorism'<br>
<br>
December 3, 2001<br>
<br>
Few words in the English language are more misused than the word<br>
terrorist. One front page last week carried eight stories, and every<br>
one included a reference to terrorists.<br>
<br>
All adversaries are not terrorists. President Bush's description of<br>
any nation that &quot;harbors&quot; terrorists as a terrorist nation is<br>
meaningless. Many nations, including this one, must deal with<br>
fanatical protesters. That does not make every nation terrorist.<br>
<br>
It is a relative term. In Israel, Palestinians who kill Israeli<br>
civilians are called terrorists. Israelis who kill Palestinian<br>
civilians are called soldiers.<br>
<br>
It is this relativism that led the Reuters news agency to tell<br>
reporters to stop using the word, that one man's terrorist is<br>
another's freedom fighter.<br>
<br>
Two weeks ago Secretary of State Colin Powell urged Palestinians to<br>
arrest and punish &quot;perpetrators of terrorist acts&quot; against Israel and<br>
told Israel to &quot;end its occupation&quot; of Palestine.<br>
<br>
Are acts committed against an occupier acts of terrorism or of<br>
resistance?<br>
<br>
Surely, you say, the word is not always relative. The heinous acts of<br>
Osama bin Laden fit the political definition of terrorism, which is<br>
the use of violent means against civilians to achieve political ends.<br>
<br>
Bin Laden is an easy case, both because his means were so<br>
disproportionate and because he acted against civilians living under<br>
a democratic government that is not an occupier.<br>
<br>
What of the suicide bombings in Israel this weekend, which killed at<br>
least 25 civilians?<br>
<br>
In 1947-48, Jews in Palestine blew up British civilians (the King<br>
David Hotel) and Palestinian civilians (Deir Yassin). For Jews, both<br>
peoples were occupiers, and Jewish bombers were freedom fighters, not<br>
terrorists.<br>
<br>
For years, Israeli leaders, including Prime Ministers Menachem Begin<br>
and Yitzhak Shamir, refused to deal with PLO leader Yasser Arafat on<br>
grounds he was a terrorist. The current prime minister, Ariel Sharon,<br>
still refuses to deal with Arafat.<br>
<br>
If Arafat was a terrorist, what of Begin, Shamir and Sharon?<br>
<br>
In 1947-48, Begin headed Irgun, an underground group pledged to drive<br>
Britain out of Palestine (which Britain did not &quot;occupy&quot; but ruled<br>
under international mandate) and to fight Palestinians. Irgun was<br>
responsible for the massacre of 250 Palestinian civilians, including<br>
many women and children, at Deir Yassin, a village near Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
Shamir headed Lehi, an Irgun splinter group also known as the &quot;Stern<br>
Gang.&quot; In 1944, with the Allied war still raging against the Nazis,<br>
Lehi murdered Lord Moyne, the British minister for the Middle East.<br>
<br>
Four years later, Lehi (a Hebrew acronym for &quot;Freedom Fighters of<br>
Israel&quot;) was held responsible for the murder of Count Folke<br>
Bernadotte, U.N. mediator for Palestine. Bernadotte's sin was a plan<br>
calling for the union of all the people of Palestine -- Jews,<br>
Palestinians and Jordanians.<br>
<br>
Is Sharon a terrorist?<br>
<br>
In 1982, Defense Minister Sharon planned Israel's invasion of<br>
Lebanon. During the occupation of Beirut, hundreds of Palestinian<br>
refugees in two camps were murdered by Lebanese Christian militiamen,<br>
allies of Israel. An Israeli investigation the following year found<br>
Sharon &quot;indirectly responsible&quot; for the massacre, and he was forced<br>
to resign from office.<br>
<br>
Now Sharon heads a government that deliberately follows a policy<br>
of &quot;decapitation,&quot; that is, assassination of Palestinian officials.<br>
<br>
For years, Arafat was called a terrorist, not just by Israel and<br>
America but by Egypt, which jailed him as a member of the Muslim<br>
Brotherhood, terrorists in Nasser's eyes. Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a<br>
nation on the State Department's &quot;terrorist&quot; list, tried several<br>
times to kill Arafat.<br>
<br>
When a &quot;terrorist nation&quot; kills a &quot;terrorist&quot; is it an act of<br>
terrorism?<br>
<br>
Arafat's Fatah was at the top of the U.S. and Israeli &quot;terrorist&quot;<br>
lists for years. Then Fatah morphed into the PLO and then into the<br>
Palestinian Authority, which Israel now counts on to fight terrorists.<br>
<br>
When do terrorists become statesmen? When terrorism succeeds.<br>
<br>
The word has been debased and degraded into meaninglessness, and Bush<br>
did not help last week:<br>
<br>
&quot;If anybody harbors a terrorist, they're a terrorist. If they house<br>
terrorists, they're terrorists. I mean, I can't make it any more<br>
clearly (sic) to other nations around the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, yes, perhaps he could. There are real terrorists out there,<br>
ones like bin Laden and al-Qaeda.<br>
<br>
But the idea that we will turn our wrath on every nation with which<br>
we have a dispute (e.g. North Korea, Iraq), or which harbor groups<br>
potentially hostile to us (e.g. the Philippines, Sudan, Syria, Egypt)<br>
is to turn a legitimate conflict into national paranoia.<br>
<br>
We will always face opposition from nations and groups that oppose<br>
our values and our policies. That does not make them all terrorists.<br>
<br>
Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda brought two new elements to terrorism:<br>
They used more deadly means than ever before, and they are<br>
irrational. Groups like Irgun, Lehi, Fatah and Hamas used means<br>
proportionate to their ends and were coldly rational.<br>
<br>
There is no question about al-Qaeda's terrorism. Leave it at that.<br>

Solathan,<br>
<br>
  I don't think I have time to respond to every bit of your post, but I'll take a crack at a few pieces of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;- As time passes, Ottoman empire falls into the deepest pits of corruption, and loses all its ethics and morality, turning them into tyranny and such ( don't most of them go that way?)&quot;<br>
<br>
Hm, this sounds like you're coloring the actions of the Ottoman Empire to set the stage for your representation of the facts.  This isn't a fact, it's you're opinion =)<br>
<br>
&quot;More time passes, World War I erupts, millions and millions die, and the Ottoman Empire falls down, the 'sick man' dies.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point you neglect to mention that it was in 1922 that it was agreed that Israel and Palestine would become independant seperate countries in this region.  This is a very important fact without which, some of the things you point to later don't give a full picture.<br>
<br>
&quot;-World War II starts, the inhumane, evil and vile 'Holocaust' ( look at other threads to see what i think about killing innocents  ) happens. Lots of innocent jews die. Britain is fed up with the trouble it has to deal with in Palastine. The 'Promise of Belfor ( sp? ) ' is promised, and the start of the Israeli country solidifies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somewhat inaccurate, see my comment about 1922.  Israel was destined to become a state long before WW II was even a nightmare in Hitler's eye.   So was Palestine.  The Holocaust did 2 things for Israeli statehood :<br>
1 - Showed that the Jews needed a place of their own, or they would continue to be persecuted.<br>
2 - Debilitated the British Empire such that it could no longer keep what colonies it still had.<br>
<br>
&quot; The land 'deeds' of Palastinee people are considered 'invalid' according to the Israeili goverment, and are valueless. Folks are Evicted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Only partially accurate.  First, Israel 'evicted' Palestinians from territory destined to become 'Israel'.  This is as opposed to the land that was to become 'Palestine'.  One must wonder why the Palestinians did not migrate to Palestine over the years.<br>
Another major fact :<br>
1 - They were attacked by the Palestinians and other Arab states the day after being recognized.<br>
Im sure this fact plays no small role in the eviction of the Palestinians.  Keep in mind this was not a war fought with armies for the most part, it was largely fought by settlers in their houses and neighborhoods with their wives and children standing behind them.<br>
<br>
The above answers this question you place :<br>
&quot;Why did the Israeli goverment accept those sales ( from absentees no less) and consider their deeds valid and then chose  to discard the deeds of the local palastinees?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Palestinians waged war on Israel.  They lost.  Case closed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's assume i bought 95% of the landscape in hte state of florida (Just an example, insert any name of any state/province, place in any place in the world ). Does that give me the right to bring my own goverment and do what i want in that area?&quot;<br>
<br>
First, It does if the UN says you're an independant country.  Second, this analogy is false because the USA and Florida have functioning govornments.  The areas Israel occupies did not have functioning govornments, except the British one which was about to leave.  The analogy to provinces / states of functioning govornments is patently false.<br>
<br>
&quot;Without Britain's promise and its denied 'support' ( them UN and the sort ) , how could the purchase of that land (which is still sort-of  disputed, look above) legalize the eviction, massacres, and the institution of a goverment on that land?&quot;<br>
<br>
Two govorments were supposed to take control of seperate areas, one Palestinian the other Israeli.  Despite your emotionalistic words, the reality is one of three choices 1 - All Israeli state, 2 - All Palestinian state, or 3 - Seperate states.   The choice was made for #3, 2 states.  I suppose you would want an all Palestinian run state?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Really, how could that rationally and logically happen? How could the Israeli army ( which, as you say is inferiorly equipped and with less warriors) win against them all, without support?&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you believe in God?  <br>
<br>
In this specific case though, the Arabs started fighting each other.  However, the 'luck' of the Israeli military is probably the best case for the existance of God that I know of in recent times.  Or maybe its just proof that modern Arab culture is inherently corrupt, that they would bungle so many conflicts when the odds were so much in their favor.  Americans tend to think it was because of american tech, but the simple fact is they didn't use much american stuff until after 1973, the last big Arab-Israeli war.  They won 3 other wars without our tech, and the 1973 war was about half / half US and French weapons.  The same kind of weapons the Arab states have available to them. <br>
<br>
And no, i don't buy off on your conspiracy theory about support for Israel.  Europe was still selling equipment to the Middle East, but both Europe and USA had embargos on Israel.<br>
<br>
Here is a dirty little secret though.  The US became more pro-israeli when it learned that Israel had almost gone nuclear in the first days of the 1973 Yom Kippur war.  Israel apparently obtained the ability to create nuclear weapons when the French sold them a reactor and heavy water in the mid to late 1960s.<br>

Ill tell you why you dont.  CAUSE YOU DON T KNOW JACK!! The only posts I see of yours are critiques of others.   You dont have the balls or the brains to make your own post.  YOu are just like most people.  You criticize others to make yourself look better.   You dumbasses really believe that palestinians only want to kill jews??  You dont think they have a right to be angry with the jews for settling on their land??  Go to your library and search Palestine and Israel and you will see that Israel is settling JEWS on palestinian land that was NOT bought by Jews.  yea, I dont know what happeneed 50 or so years ago but neither do all you fuks.  All you people coming on the board bitching at people for expressing their opinions.   You dont know shit obviously.  If your only reason for coming to this board is to criticize others and offer no good information on the topic then shut the fuk up.  I do know one thing about the Israel/Palestinian conflict.  And it TRUE that Jews are being settled on Palestinian Lands by the JEWISH government.   Warangel ,  GO blow yourself.  Oh, thats right, You don't have one, you fukin panzy coward. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukytherion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kytherion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 325<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/11/01 12:54:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cliff notes, coming soon.</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'll be totally civil while discussing this, please no insults or such.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kyth, you claim your sources are 'impeccable'. I am sorry, but i found that really funny ( in a twisted sort of way). If you really think those who wrote your 'history' and your 'documents' are utterly and completely honest and un-biased, that they won't twist the events themselves to suit what they like and want, then i really pity you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd say you need some further lessons in what constitutes civility. Don't wave a banner of truce and then forget your manners, bud. I'll respect your initial request for now, despite your insulting tone. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;History, my friend, is written by men. Men, tend to be biased...&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, thank you. Unfortunately, I don't know a single respectable institution of higher learning that would NOT accept a UN document as a valid source.<br>
<br>
I said my sources were impeccable, not unbiased. All history is biased. The UN document is impeccable in that it bashes BOTH sides.<br>
<br>
I was willing to provide more, right up until it became apparent that Miblis would not acknowledge any source that did not already support his assumptions.<br>
<br>
And despite a VERY long search, I was unable to find a single Palestinian-sponsored internet source that was not thoroughly laced with racial slurs.<br>
<br>
It might be pointed out that Miblis failed to provide even a single source that would stand as valid in any academic discussion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now. You've said that your thoughts are scattered, and I won't argue the point. You seem to be in some confusion as to how land ownership works.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Ottoman Rulers divine the 'lands' all over the countries they 'own'. They take 'royalties' as 'absentee' owners...those 'absentee' land owners still are pretty much the owners.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meanwhile, Jews start ( or keep on , however it might be) buying land, in huge amounts, from both Ottoman 'absentee' owners and Palastinee land owners outside Israel.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right...<br>
<br>
&quot;The land 'deeds' of Palastinee people are considered 'invalid' according to the Israeili goverment, and are valueless. Folks are Evicted.&quot;<br>
<br>
What? What land deeds, Solathan? They didn't own it. They could not have possessed deeds to land they did not own. You've already said the absentees owned it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You give utter legitimacy to those sales. For you, it is a buy and sell transaction. Those sales DID happen. I dispute their validity  in two ways, a 'legal' way and a 'moral' way.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can't wait.<br>
<br>
&quot;Legal way: Why did  the Israeli goverment accept those sales ( from absentees no less) and consider their deeds valid and then chose to discard the deeds of the local palastinees?<br>
<br>
WHAT DEEDS? Solathan, most of them couldn't even read. They were the sharecropping tenants of an aging and corrupt feudal system. No deeds.<br>
<br>
If you think you've got proof of rural Palestinians being evicted from land they OWNED en mass, post it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ethical way: Jews bought the lands from those who have no right to it ( if you think an occupier who owns land without paying for it or seeing it, who takes royalties just because is all right...that would tell me what kind of person you are).&quot;<br>
<br>
No right to it? Solathan, under that logic, no standing nation on earth could justify its existence. When the Turks took control of the land, things like &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;humanism&quot; didn't exist. They owned it. They'd owned it for centuries.<br>
<br>
Your ethical point is pointless, since it has no relevancy to the time period in which the Turks acquired control of Palestine. And further, you acknowledge my ORIGINAL point: that it was Moslems that sold the land in the first place.<br>
<br>
Unless, like the Shi'ites from another post of yours, Moslem Turks don't qualify as &quot;real&quot; Moslems. If so, I humbly crave your pardon for my disgusting generalization.<br>
<br>
FINAL WORD ON THE LAND ISSUE:<br>
<br>
You can't seem to decide who owned the land, Solathan. One moment it's the absentees, other moment it's the sharecroppers themselves. When you can make up your mind, we'll talk.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, i'll keep going your way. Let's assume the land DID belong to them, let's assume Israel DOES have some sort of right to exist in that particular place. Why are they so...evil? Why are the massacres they do are ok, while what's happens against them is terrorism?&quot;<br>
<br>
Excuse my rudeness, BUT ARE YOU FUCKING DEAF?<br>
<br>
I've said I don't care for Zionism. I won't morally justify Israel's existence for you, Solathan, because I can't do it for myself.<br>
<br>
Please. Read my posts and post relevant inquiries if you want this to remain flame-free. Thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd like to hear what you said.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think if you were interested, you'd have read it thoroughly in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;One last point, you say that 5 arab nations fought a young, a very young israel and lost while having far superior equipement and numbers without American/British/international support?<br>
<br>
Really, how could that rationally and logically happen? How could  the Israeli army ( which, as you say is inferiorly equipped and with less warriors) win against them all, without support?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, now we're getting ridiculous. I've addressed this, Solathan, quite clearly.<br>
<br>
They lost because they were incompetent. The Arab attack was torn apart from within by petty squabbles, rampant corruption, and a complete lack of decisive leadership.<br>
<br>
NOT UNLIKE THE ARAB WORLD AS IT EXISTS TODAY.<br>
<br>
A point I've already made.<br>
<br>
Please read my posts and feel free to discuss, I'll be glad to engage in civil discussion. But my patience wears thin when I find myself going over the same things. If that's what you want, just go back and pretend all my posts are directed towards yourself, rather than Miblis.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
