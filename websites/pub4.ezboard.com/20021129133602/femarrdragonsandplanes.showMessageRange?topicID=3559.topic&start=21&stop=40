I was told it was english as a second language.  I was also told she HAD to pass them with no less than a C.  If you are in school to learn.. should you not learn all you can and get a grade fairly based on what you CAN and HAVE learned??

<br>
But this one gets my goat.<br>
<br>
This is the United States of America.  The de facto language is English.  If you live here, you should learn it.<br>
<br>
Period.<br>
<br>
Learning languages is good for you, blah blah blah.  Being culturally aware is good for you, blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
Pull your @#%$ heads out.<br>
<br>
I'm one hundred percent Filipino.  I'm a first generation American.  My parents struggled through naturalization, swore citizenship here.  They followed every rule.  My grandfathers shed blood for the cause of democracy, championed by the United States.  My maternal grandfather was a Master Sergeant and Quartermaster of the U.S. Army and served in World War II.  My paternal grandfather was an officer of the Philippine military, and was similarly decorated by the U.S.<br>
<br>
I speak Spanish, French, Tagalog, and English fluently.  I can get by daily phrases in Japanese, can navigate with basic amounts of German, Italian, and Portuguese, and can say &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;how are you&quot; in Mandarin and Cantonese.  I have studied enough Latin to know and understand the roots of romance languages.  I am familiar with better than average amounts of world history.  I know that the origin of Aryan is India, go figure.  I studied the schism of the original three sects of Islam.  I know how Hindi and several related dialects sprung from Sanskrit.  I can very often with decent accuracy determine to within 300 miles of your surname's origin, anywhere in the world.  I can tell from your name if you are from North India or South India.  I know at a glance if you are Punjabi or Sikh.  I speak dialects, I can do accents.  I can sing the entire Soviet anthem, and translate it.  I live in California.<br>
<br>
And this is still the @#%$ United States of America.   The Constitution is written in English.  Wanna know your rights?  Better @#%$ learn it.<br>
<br>
My tax dollars are squandered in printing the California Driver's Manual in more languages than I can shake a stick at.  And the street signs are still printed in Latin/Roman/Romanji/whatever-your-language's-word-for-it-is.  Idiocy.<br>
<br>
They want to print ballots in Tagalog.  Dumbfucks.  Spend 3 million dollars of taxpayer money in a flagging economy to print ballots in Tagalog.  Duh.  Guess what?  Philippine government documents are in English.  Can one possibly be more stupid?<br>
<br>
Tolerance expressed in the way many of you suggest is why my tax dollars pay for ESL programs that people don't even attend regularly!  Heck, go read <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.vdare.com/guzzardi/joe_education.htm.">www.vdare.com/guzzardi/jo...ation.htm.</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Japanese street signs are increasingly converting to Romanji.  And we print the drivers manual in kanji and katakana?  Ass backwards.<br>
<br>
I love cultural diversity.<br>
<br>
But we are the UNITED States of America.  What unites people?  Common ground.  Common customs.  Common concerns.  Common desires.<br>
<br>
Mexican-American, Filipino-American, Japanese-American.  Hey, are you noticing a pattern here?  What do all these ethnic groups have in common?<br>
<br>
How the @#%$ do you expect to create harmony of unity and diversity at the same time when you justify preserving customs that separate people?  I'm not talking about family values, the right to wear your traditional clothing, sing your traditional songs, or raise your children to be multi-lingual.  By all means, please do, it enriches everyone to maintain diversity.  But to create a society where people can't communicate at a common level?  Where social classes and castes are separated by language?  What next?  Is each ethnic group going to have a different set of laws too?  You know, in the Philippines, corporal punishment is not only accepted, it's normal.  So does that mean Filipino-American children can be whacked with broom handles in the private home of a Filipino-American household, their private property being their own sovereign domain?<br>
<br>
Draw a line somewhere.  Have some balls, take a stand.<br>
<br>
In the Philippines, I speak Tagalog.  In France I speak French.  In Argentina I speak Spanish.  And in the United States of America, I speak English.<br>
<br>
English, American, pick a nit on that point and I encourage you not to breed.  Last thing we need is progeny that can't @#%$ due to sphincter constriction bred through generations.<br>
<br>
I say &quot;thank you&quot; at the Chinese restaurant in whatever dialect that they speak.  It's nice.  It brings people together.  It makes them smile.  It shows my respect for their culture.  The same in any home or business that preserves and shares their culture.<br>
<br>
But this is a country.  It is governed.  It is defended.  It is theoretically united.  Be @#%$ practical.<br>
<br>
Open-minded is good.  Naive and stupid is another.  Several of you are flirting with the not-so-fine-line between the two.<br>
<br>
Go outside, see the day workers lined on the street, unable to gain better employment because we don't encourage them to attain skills (like competent English) that allow them to get better work and improve the lot of themselves and their families.  Watch them band together and drink, wallowing their sorrows, preserving their mistrust of &quot;outsiders&quot;, unwilling to integrate, and all the while feeding their entire family squeezed into one bedroom of a two-bedroom low-income housing unit on food stamps.  Watch their children grow disadvantated, yes right here in the heart of the U.S.A. and join gangs, watch them mark territory, watch them steal, watch their names in the &quot;crime watch&quot; section of your local newspaper.<br>
<br>
What the @#%$ are you thinking?<br>
<br>
Have you so little perception of what divides people and what brings them together?  That the subtle things in common create brotherhood?  That communication is the building block of unity, and that language is an important key of communication?  We're not talking about freedom of expression, we're not talking about preservation of cultural roots, we're talking about different people living in harmony.  And you wonder why Americans are so full of angst.<br>
<br>
Wake the @#%$ up.  You are espousing tolerance of language-racism.  It's not to be tolerated.<br>
<br>
Yes, learn more languages.  Learn more cultures.  Learn more history.  Reach out to your fellow man, take his hand, bid him greeting in his own language, watch his face brighten and return your greeting.  And then wonder why everyone doesn't enjoy that little bright gift of human understanding between strangers.  It's because not everyone is multi-lingual.  Not everyone is multi-cultural.  If you want to create harmony, you've got two choices.  Force everyone to be fantastically multi-lingual.  Or enforce a common tongue.<br>
<br>
Or you can refill your bowl and toke some more.  Your call.<br>

<br>
  Wait I know... I should go on welfare. Now THAT is a joke... right now if you're whole of body and mind, under 60, not pregnant, married, and don't have children it DOES NOT MATTER that you haven't eaten in a week. The available resources go to those in &quot;need&quot; first... regardless of how often you get dizzy and almost pass out at work because your daily diet consists of four slices of toast and enough water to make your stomach stop hurting.<br>
<br>
  Also, speaking english is considered AGAINST a person applying for any form of welfare.<br>
<br>
As to all the people who said it was spanish land first.... your point is what exactly? It's US land now.<br>
<br>
I don't recall reading in any history books that there were special rules for, say, german immegrants (damn, I just cannot seem to spell that today). ESL classes weren't in existance then... parents learned english, and taught it to thier children. They kept thier foods, thier religeon (sp?), thier clothing and music and celebrations... the only thing they &quot;lost&quot; was a language. <p><center><A HREF="http://www.clanautumnwood.com" TARGET="_top">

Looking at some of these post I know why alot non-english people dont like white people from the burbs.  <br>

     Spend a year in a forign countery with a bunch of people that dont speak your language with a job that pay $4. Do that and come back and tell me how you feel about the other language. All you people dont see the other side of the story and are there for blinding by your igorance.

     Now matter how much you think you are not a racist if you think like Cendan you are a racist. I alway try and stay on good vibes but when stuff like this come up it make me sick. I am a hypocrit but all of you are too.<br>
<br>
Oh and Cendan you wrote one of the most racist post I have ever seen. You should go grab a white hood and a burning cross right now. It is people like you that voted for bush it is you that make alot of people scared to go to a job invew at a big company because of your dumb ass ingnorance. I hope you lose you job and get to see what it @#%$ feels like. <br>

If this sound harsh maybe because I am high or maybe because it is the hard @#%$ truth. I would say more but I wont because I have put up with alot of racist @#%$ for all my life and I guess I just got to till I die.<br>

<br>
Let me tell you something. If the majority of folk were prepared to take them at face value rather than automatically class them as third world peasants, then maybe they'd find human beings just like them.<br>
<br>
But most of them aren't given that chance.<br>
<br>
As a migrant myself (albeit an English-speaking one) I've encountered mostly cliches and stereotypes of what I should be when dealing with people. <br>
<br>
The willingness of people to pigeonhole and summarize others based on a very skewed perspective of their homeland isn't unique to the US.<br>
<br>
Ask any Eastern Euorpean migrant to Australia what a &quot;wog&quot; is sometime.<br>
<br>
The Mexicans probably feel that it's a wasted effort to learn English and integrate, simply as the perception that they're worthless cleaners/sweepers/lawn-mowers/burger-flippers/insert-your-racial-cliche here is so endemic. Few people seem willing to accept them as just another bunch of people.<br>
<br>
So they find comfort among their own kind.<br>
<br>
And that's not unique to the US either.<br>
<br>
But, unlike a lot of places that have a rich and polyglot nation, America seems to have gone down the &quot;salad bowl&quot; path, i.e cultures and ethnicities dwell side-by-side but rarely commingle or intermarry. There's a lot of insularity and parochialism fighting against it.<br>
<br>
Slowly but surely, this is being eroded.<br>
<br>
America is actually a pretty fair place, nonetheless. It doesn't impose linguistic or naming restrictions like some nations do, namely Iceland. Folk are free to read, speak and write their own language. America doesn't deny the existence of minorities unlike the nation of my ancestors; Greece.<br>
<br>
So, there's two reasons that don't motivate Mexicans or other NESB foreigners to learn English. One, is the perception people have of them and their nation of origin and two, there is no legal demand on them to adopt the language.<br>

Ah, so this really IS about racism and not language.  I kind of thought it was; your prejudiced remarks above make that clear.  <br>

By the way, I didn't &quot;advocate&quot; you losing your job -- I said that IF I were the employer and realized that you were in a position in which you spent 75 percent of your day doing stuff which isn't related to your actual job, I'd conclude I had a mismatch of job and employee, and transfer you.

If you must know, I'm a rape and abuse counselor and I specialize my work with women and children.  I was a 20 year old undergrad at the time and I was competing with people with degrees for a position at a safe house in L.A.  Yes, I beat out the other people.  I sat down during my interview with them and impressed them enough, convincing them I'm intelligent, a hard worker, and a quick learner, and what I lack in experience I'll make up with what I have going on.  They didn't just look at my resume and say, &quot;omfg trilingual hire her!&quot;<br>
<br>
I feel perfectly justified.  I would have hired me, considering Los Angeles consists of a huge Mandarin and Spanish population, and I happen to speak fluent Mandarin and basic Spanish, and the job calls for someone to gain a victim's trust through communication.  I dunno, I've never tried counseling through a translator before.  Would you like talking to a shrink or counselor through a 3rd party member?  I think not.<br>

It's always been that way.  People who do international business need people who speak other languages.  Language *is* a skill, unless you've forgotten.  And, it doesn't really matter what skills you have if you can't communicate your ideas clearly, anyway.<br>

Oh, so it's all *their* fault, now.  Very mature.  Tell me, did you come to that conclusion all by yourself?  Let me tell you something, you little suburbanite, middle-class, anglicized dillitente, all my life I will be held on a separate level from the pretty little caucasian faces because my hair happens to be black and my skin happens to be olive, and I'll be working twice as hard as every other &quot;American&quot; to correct peoples' first visual impression of me.  <br>
<br>
Don't feed me that, &quot;it's their fault they're not held on the same standard&quot; crap because I string together a cohesive and logical statement better than most, but being ethnic, I'll always be Asian-American before I'm just &quot;American.&quot;  <br>
<br>
You see, the difference between people like you and people like me is that people like you, when faced with a problem, cry about how much their pussies hurt while people like me adapt and would rather spend the energy I could use to whine to instead try to remedy the situation with some sort of solution.<br>
<br>
You can whine all you want, but the truth of the matter is that these Mexican bastards are making you uncomfortable on the job- boo hoo~, isn't that right?<br>
<br>
Now, let me introduce you to my 'common denominator theory' which often allows me to produce the easiest solution to a problem.  If there is a recurring problem, note the common denominator.  In this case, it's you.  Lots of Hispanics are calling and you don't know a lick of Espanol.  Well, it's the common denominator that needs to be changed if you'd like the swiftest results.  I don't know about you, but if that were my job, I'd learn some basic Spanish because the day all immigrants are forced to learn English won't be arriving anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Do I agree with immigrants not learning a language?  Hell no, scares the living daylights out of me knowing they don't know English and they're out driving on roads that have street signs written in English.<br>
<br>
Am I going to sit here and whine till me teeth fall out about how all them damn coloreds should learn English?  Truth of the matter is that they should, but it's not happening anytime soon.  The argument is a futile one.<br>
<br>
In other words, get your @#%$ head out of your a$$.  If it bothers you *that* much you would have enrolled in a foreign language class.  Obviously, it doesn't bother you enough to that point, but enough so you come here and cry about the woes of your job picking up telephones.<br>
<br>
Real tough.  That's the American spirit.  Whine about how much your ass hurts from sitting on it.  Go, you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 4458<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/18/02 6:22:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3559.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Off Topic Racist Rant...</span><hr size=1> Go Aishen !

<br>
Aishfoo, you know I love ya, but here's my issue.<br>
<br>
The common denominator <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be English in the United States.<br>
<br>
The French-decended learned English.  The German-descended learned English.  The Italian-descended learned English.  The Filipino-descended learned English.  The Japanese-descended learned English.<br>
<br>
Obviously (or not), in recent years I've kept company with a lot of Argentines and Colombians, not just descended citizens but legal resident aliens (green card holders).  They speak English.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> a citizen or even a LEGAL immigrent (sp?)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm not throwing behind everything Kulani is saying here, but there's an important point to make.<br>
<br>
I don't know any legal green card holder who doesn't speak fluent English.  I don't know any naturalized citizens who don't speak fluent English.<br>
<br>
The next thing I'm about to say can be taken wrong.  Have a care.<br>
<br>
My next point is the difference between American rights and human rights.  Human rights are a universal thing.<br>
<br>
I'm an American.  I am a citizen.  My parents legally immigrated, and contributed to this society.  I have more American rights than the illegal van-contraband basement-hiding illegal alien.<br>
<br>
Contributing to this society is not solely a matter of &quot;do you work?&quot;.  Many many many illegal aliens perform necessary (if thankless and don't-pay-squat) jobs that enriches us economically with cheap labor on our own soil.  It's not enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.&quot;<br>
<br>
If someone doesn't believe in it, why do they deserve as many rights as me, my parents who made the sacrifice to be here, and the millions of others?<br>
<br>
And, call it coincidence if you will, most people who believe in it for some reason or another learn English.  There's your common denominator.<br>
<br>

Gay ass ezboard had an error that deleted my post... but oh well.<br>
<br>
I am not a racist so insert here the 3 paragraphs that were in my deleted post that showed you I wasn't.<br>
<br>
As far as Bush.  People say I can't complain if I don't vote, but when I vote they assume that means I condone all the policies of the person I chose.  Bush was easily the lesser of two evils but you won't ever see anyone in the white house that represents me.  Regardless, I respect their position.<br>
<br>
Let me try to reproduce the main part of my post:<br>
<br>
Sorry, I don't speak self pitty so most of what I got from your post was wah wah wah, give or take a wah.  Have some balls, if people want to make fun of you because of your nationality then let them.  Do the opinions of ignorant people have the power to ruin your day?  When you are in the right you have no reason to hide.<br>
<br>
I won't assume you were getting high, since you said "maybe."  <b>If</b> you do get high then by all means just let someone else have the job that won't inhale the pay.<br>
<br>
Back on the subject... not everyone is going to agree with the correct statement that all americans should learn english, but I find it funny when someone calls me a racist for wanting that.  I would, without a doubt, learn Spanish if I lived in Mexico.  To be honest I so loved my time there, I liked the people, hated the government... but whatever.<br>

I see no contradictions in my two statements.  You are correct about one thing, however, I can't answer that question.  Because that was a question asked specifically to Kulani, about how SHE believes them to act as second-class citizens.  Seeing as how I don't know her, I can't speak for her, hence I can't answer that question.  Idiot.  Being made to feel like a second-class citizen is different from acting like one.  Moron.  Perhaps you should read a little more closely before you insult someone's intelligence.

It doesn't happen overnight... but it DOES happen. Example, the european groups got here first... and now it's to the point where most european descended americans don't know thier racial background.

&quot;transfer&quot; me where exactly? It's a retail clothing store... there is one job... sort of a combination stocker and cashier. I don't think my job SHOULD require me to speak a non native language in order to get my work done.<br>
<br>
Since there IS nowhere to transfer me to it leaves one option. Firing me and hiring someone who speaks a foreign language in thier own country.<br>

And perhaps if you wish to stop being treated as a spoiled brat, you'll stop acting like one. Answer me this: how do they give the impression of being second-class citizens? Please, explain that to me. Is it because they are different? I'd really love to hear your explanation. Oh, and God knows that someone who wasn't born in this country certainly doesn't deserve your job. They are clearly inferior<br>

They give the impression of being second class citizens by NOT SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE CITIZENS.<br>
<br>
I don't think that is too complex to understand.<br>
<br>
And I don't care if someone who wasn't born in this country beats me out for a job... as long as I can say &quot;I lost this job because that person was better qualified&quot;. But I would be extremely pissed if someone who wasn't as qualified as I am for a given job was handed the job on a silver platter because of a damn language.<br>

In other words, get your @#%$ head out of your a$$. If it bothers you *that* much you would have enrolled in a foreign language class. Obviously, it doesn't bother you enough to that point, but enough so you come here and cry about the woes of your job picking up telephones.<br>

  Why should I enroll in a foreign language class to hold a job in my native country?<br>
<br>
  As to your job... are you happy that those poor women are being counseled by someone with inferior skills? Does part of your help involve teaching them english so that they can be transferred to a counseler with the skills they need?<br>
<br>
  If I was raped and needed a counseler, I would be damn offended if I learned that my counceler wasn't the best I could of had, but instead was hired because she spoke a non-native language.<br>
<br>
as an aside, I DO applaud the work you are doing, and agree that yes, you need to have the ability to speak the language of your clients. Course... I still think we should catch all rapists, stretch thier equipment over a chopping block, and remove the offending parts... and since part of it's a mental defect, I suggest lobotomizing the sons of bitches too... but then theres the problem of proof... but thats another thread.<br>
<br>
My apologies if I come off as combative... it is not my intention. My intention is to get the frustration of practicaly being forced to learn a foriegn language just to survive in my native land. <p><center><A HREF="http://www.clanautumnwood.com" TARGET="_top">

It would surprise me not at all if you've encountered several, just never assumed that they were illegal immegrants, and used your ignorance of their language as an excuse not to find out.<br>

Apparently in 1878 they decided that they had given them long enough to learn the language of the new government. <br>

Taken from the United States naturalization and eligibility homepage. It would seem the the US does in fact have a national language, and to become an American citizen you must atleast meet this requirement.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Language <br>
<br>
Applicants for naturalization must be able to read, write, speak, and understand words in ordinary usage in the English language. Applicants exempt from this requirement are those who on the date of filing: <br>
<br>
have been residing in the United States subsequent to a lawful admission for permanent residence for periods totaling 15 years or more and are over 55 years of age; <br>
have been residing in the United States subsequent to a lawful admission for permanent residence for periods totaling 20 years or more and are over 50 years of age; or <br>
have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, where the impairment affects the applicants ability to learn English. <br>

I don't face this issue on a daily basis, so it doesn't affect me personally but I do agree that people living in a country should atleast make an effort to know the bare minimum of the native language to function within the society. <p><table align=center>
