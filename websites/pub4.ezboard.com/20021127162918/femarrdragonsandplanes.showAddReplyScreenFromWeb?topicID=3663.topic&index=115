First, Shantara. I have known Kilmal for much longer than you. I knew him before he got his first guild in DF. He is the same person. Months after i retired my SK to start my necro (the SK that I first met him with) he inquired why I never played him anymore. How else could he have known about him? Also, his e-mail address has not changed since I first met him, so YES I can say that he did not buy his account. Perhaps you truely believe it, or perhaps you made it up to hurt him. From what I have heard about you, Shantara, you seem like a pretty reasonable person, so listen to reason.<br>
<br>
There are two things that need to be adressed I think, both were posted by Keldarn.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3. Necro clown_01 you were not there, you have no idea what happened. From reading Kilmal's post he really has no idea what happened either. One thing is clear though, you could make a living at hiring yourself out as a character witness, since you don't seem to mind putting your name on the line for people you hardly know, and in situations you know nothing about.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
To the second part of this comment: You my friend have no idea what you are talking about. I have known Kilmal for MUCH longer than ANY of you have. There have been entire nights where he will sit in a newbie zone and just buff / heal / give equipment away. When he does this I usually will sit up in bazaar and go into trader mode and we will just chat about stuff in game or in real life. So I can say that I know him (in game, and in real life) better than ANYONE in your guild. To the first part of your comment. You are right, I was not there. If I was this would not have happened as your first shaman would have had DMF and not have had lev poof on him. But, since untill 4:30pm PST on Thursday afternoon no one from your guild was willing to tell the whole story, so what I have to go on was the comments that Kilmal made to me, and what I have read on this thread. The fact that NONE of you came forward with the whole story untill today makes me think that he was telling the truth, or i would have assumed you would have mentioned it earlier.<br>
<br>
Next quote:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;As a matter of fact I was looking for Shantara so that I could pull the mobs off her so that she could evac us if needed. Of course you were prolly too busy learning your &quot;speeches&quot; to be bothered to pay attention to what was going on around you. Since you weren't slowing, and we had buffed up prior to zoning in, and really there had been no reason for you to cast a spell for like 10 minutes or more, why were you so low on mana, and nothing had been slowed???&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First, this player admits that the druid was lost (I am not judging you for it however, it has happened to me) But to the poster (I forget who it was, although I think it was the other shaman) that tried to agrue that the druid was not lost was wrong, perhaps she made it back to the group at some point, but by that time it was too late for evac. Also, it seems to me from this post, and perhaps I am wrong, but it seems that the group WANTED Kilmal to slow / debuff the mobs. So to get on his case for using the &quot;wrong&quot; spells is a little silly. With the other shaman in the group his main role (my guess was to slow / debuff). Now, once that shaman died I really doubt that Kilmal had the time to think about what spells he should mem now that the other shaman was not there, and if he did, the moment he would have sat down the mem those spells he would have been raped by the mobs in the area.<br>
<br>
Some have made the argument that he should have tried to root the mobs. As I am sure most of you know, Sol B is not a very roomy area, so once the mobs are in visual range they are usually (not always, there are a VERY small amount of areas where this is possible although none of which are near the area they are discribing, at least that I know of) too close to the group to use root as any sort of CC. Also, there are MAYBE 2 or 3 areas in Sol B where there is room for someone to try to get aggro from a mob and then pull them away from the group to root them without just getting MORE adds, and it sounds to me like this was NOT one of those areas. So this stratigy would have no practical use even IF root was sticking to the mobs.<br>
<br>
Do I think that this guild has the right to be upset? Sure, that is your right as a guild to add / remove members. Do you have the right to bring this issue to this bored and try to get other guilds to turn against him? Not one bit! This was a GUILD issue, it should remain so. You don't like his style of play. Fine, don't invite him to group with you. Do you have the right to turn this so called &quot;warning to other guilds&quot; into a thread full of personal attacks? No, and if you were in my guild none of you would be officers, and would be on probationary status. <br>
<br>
Perhaps Kilmal should have stuck around after the group got killed. I can understand that to a point. It is nice to see all group members lending a hand to help each other out, but Kilmal's point is still a valid one. What good would he have done there? Someone said he should have buff / sow the perosn that was pulling corpses, but they HAD a shaman 2 levels his senior there, so his buffs would have been pointless. He does not know the zone so going in there AS the corpse puller would have not worked. He can't rez or summon corpses so that part doesn't work. What he would have done it stood there the entire time. Lending emotional support? Yeah, it really sounds like that is what they wanted from him.<br>
<br>
People. I am sure to the people that do not know Kilmal he is coming across rather rude. But put yourself in his shoes for a sec. You come onto this post, and read over a page of posts that are almost ALL personal attacks. Untill Shantara's post a few days later, no one in this group have the nerve to post the whole story of what happened. They posted half-truths and then complete lies (whether or not they believed them). I am not here to place blame on anyone. But I feel that it is unfair for everyone to attack Kilmal for this. The whole thing about cheating newbies out of their gear, oh please. Kilmal let them barrow equipment and when he asked for it back they were upset. I am guessing that Ka does not have a guild bank, or perhaps they just give things away from it (there is nothing wrong with that either way) but when you are the one that is suppling ALL of the equipment, and you are in your 30s, with no higher levels it is hard to afford. I know MANY guilds give out items / equipment from the guild bank, but the members know that they are barrowing the equipment from the guild and it should be returned when the item is outlived. This is what I mean about half-truths. <br>
<br>
Shantara, I doubt you had the whole story either, but still, can you really blame Kilmal for being upset by this post? Your guild has not only attacked Kilmal as a player, but also they have attacked him as a person. You need to keep some sort of control on your members, because flaming people like this with information that is flakey like this is not something you want your guild known for. I am NOT saying that it was intentional, but there are times when you most admit that there are times in which you are mistake or the information you had is wrong. The info about his account being sold is wrong, and him scamming newbies is a little more complicated then that.<br>
<br>
Ka, calls this thread a &quot;warning&quot; when in fact it is nothing more then a personal attack. They are trying to act noble about this by saying &quot;we are just trying to warn others.&quot; If that was true that would have posted the whole story in their FIRST post and let other people make their own assumptions.<br>
<br>
Shantara, I am not saying appoligize to Kilmal anymore then I think Kilmal should to you, but for gods sake, the personal attacks are going too far. This was a GUILD issue and should have remained that way. YOUR guild took it here, and false information posted by YOUR members will reflect on you and your guild. You removed him from the guild, as is your right as a guild leader. However, niether you, nor your members have the right to attack someone so personally. <br>
