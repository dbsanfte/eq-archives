Only way to fly Jets is with a degree.  And yes, most pilots are Air Force Academy grads.  There's a high demand for pilots, so after your degree (which the military will foot most the bill for), maybe you'll be flying ... most likely tankers or cargo haulers.<br>
<br>
Some Air Force bases have flying clubs down on the flightline where you can take lessons, so that may be an option for learning.<br>
<br>
I'm loving life in the AF right now.<br>

<br>
I'd recommend staying off the flightline, unless you don't mind losing your hearing.  3COX1 (Computer Operator) is a kick ass specialty with a nice bonus attached.  Good skills to have as a backup, lotta choices for duty assignment.<br>
<br>
Also, tell your recruiter about the &quot;altercation&quot; ... Not a big deal, unless you DON'T tell anyone and they find out ... and they will find out eventually when setting up a clearance.<br>
<br>
All the services will help you with your college ...<br>
<br>
I work in a CINC, so I've been around all the services.<br>
<br>
As far as quality of life (read: cushiness), Air Force is your best bet, and overall, we probably have the most number of technical specialties, although you'll find them in each branch.  I think the Air Force has the least culture shock of joining a military environment after leading a civilian career.<br>
<br>
Navy's probably the best for travel, if you can handle sea duty.  Great technical fields.  Would be my second choice.  Except for the boomers.  they give me the willies.<br>
<br>
From a college standpoint, the Army has the best thing going.  If you're in it purely for college, I say go Army.  They have a program that'll pay for the schooling you received before you joined.  The Air Force didn't do that for me, and I'm still paying off my college loans.  (I still love the Air Force, anyway).  If you like the outdoors, you'll LOVE the field, heh ... or you could just try to get into an AF mobility unit ... Plus, the Army's got alot of Hummers!  Mmm, Humvees ...<br>
<br>
If you were going to join the Marines, you'd have known it by now.  It's an attitude, a personality/character kind of thing.  If you're gung ho, go for it.  If you don't jump in whole heartedly, though, get ready for hell.  The Marines, without a doubt, have some of the strongest comraderie between service members that I have seen.<br>
<br>
Oh, and don't forget about the Coasties ... The Coast Guard has a lot of unique job experiences, if you're the nautical type.<br>
<br>
That's all I got for j00... hope some of the other EQ'ers from services other than the AF chime in, too.  They can give you a much better view of their branches than I can, looking from the outside.<br>

<br>
Shnarf, if you decide you do want to join the military make sure you read everything they put before you and make sure you are ready to make the commitment they are asking of you. If they offer you something verbally make sure you get it in writing too. Do yourself and potentially me, a favor and don't join until you are ready to make the commitment.<br>
<br>
I have been in the Navy for 13 years now. I enjoy my job working computer network defense(originally I did, and still do, classified communications). I would agree with those above who advise to stay away from flight line jobs. I have seen several shipmates with permanent hearing loss from working flight decks on carriers.<br>
<br>
A great thing about the military(and I believe the Army still gives you most assistance on this) is the benefits you will get to finish your college education. Tuition assistance, GI bill, free Dantes/CLEP tests are just some of the benefits you get to make yourself more knowledgeable and marketable.<br>
<br>
The thing I like about the Navy is all the places I have seen that I would have never seen as a civilian. Bahamas, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Scotland, England, Ireland, Spain, Cuba, Hawaii, Italy, and Australia are all countries(and 1 state) that I would have probably never been able to see working any other job.<br>
<br>
Just like any other job it has it's cons too. Your first couple of years may find you doing some things you won't be crazy about(cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning). And military life is a nomadic life so you never really get to put down roots in one area for a long time(at least in the Navy, other services may be different).<br>
<br>
Overall I am glad I joined the Navy and, if I could go back and do it over again, I would still have joined. Good luck in your decision!<br>

It isnt that bad and look you get to travel (remeber they jsut sent me to Macedonia!)  If you want to fly you can do that in all 4 of the main services.  In a few you can even choose to do Fixd wing or rotary wing.  You do not need a college degree to do warrant, BUT it is highly recommened that you get one, as it makes promotion easier.  I have been in the Army for 10 years and made E-5 (sergeant) in 99'.  The pay isnt all that good, but it does help.  As an E-5 w/ 10 years in I am making $2,130.10 in base pay.  Thats not that bad but yes there are jobs that pay better.  I like the army as I am getting to travel to place i wouldt normally ( I am going to koera in Jan and then to Germany after my tour there), and you can make some good money if you can get a bonus ( I got $20,000 tax free for reinlisting here =D).  Before you finally decide to join up make sure that you go and look at all the services.  Talk to the recuriters, and if you can find other people in those services to talk to and get info from them.  I work on the chinook helicopter and it is a great job.  In my job we are dont go to the feild alot, dont put up w/ doing all of that &quot;Grunt&quot; shit that most others do, but our job is hard nonetheless.  You will end up working alot of late nights and many early mornings, but when you watch it take off adn realize that they wouldnt be able to if it wasnt for you, you get a nice feeling inside.  if you have any other questions about the Army email me and I will do what I can  to help you out.

I loved the Corps did 10 years and I swear to god that I was put on this earth to be a Marine....... On that note there were times as a young PFC that I hated the Marine corps more than anything just because it can be rough. My first duty station was Adak Alaska in 88 and that was a very uncool place to be for 12 months.<br>
<br>
Get it in writing, Be 100% honest, do your time that you signed up for honorably and do the best job you can. You will be rewarded for it, both by the Military and by the civilian world when you are done.<br>
<br>
I know nothing of the Army or the Air Force, I do know they live pretty good compared to the Navy and the Marines. But you might spend 4 years doing nothing here in the US. If you want to see new things  and experience life join the Navy or the Corps.<br>

Never ever waver on that.<br>
<br>
They may find out about it, they may not.<br>
But what they are really looking for is whether you will break down or not. If you give two different answers at different times during the recruitment process and basic training you will probably get booted.<br>
<br>
If they actually manage to ask you directly...We checked and discovered that in 1995 you were involved in a car theft ring(insert your crime as appropriate), why didn't you tell us about it? (Which they won't) Then you simply say that the case has been expunged and no longer exists in any form. You do not have a criminal record.<br>
<br>
When I joined the air force, I hadn't even gotten my teenage criminal record expunged. I told them I had no criminal record and was questioned later about it, though not specifially. I stuck by my answers and made it through without problems.<br>
<br>
They will ask you two or three times during recruitment and training all of the questions about criminal, psychological and drugs. Just stick by the answers that you gave the first time (which should all have been 'no') and you will get through it.<br>

Discount much of what non-active duty or veterans have said.<br>
They haven't been there or done that.<br>
<br>
I am an active duty Navy Sonar Technicians Submarines Petty Officer First Class.  (An STS1/SS, paygrade E-6)  I made it to this rank in 9 years.  I will have 11 years of active service this February, plus an additional year and a half in the Navy Reserves.<br>
<br>
My father retired from the Air Force after 20 years of service as a Lt. Colonel.  (Paygrade O-5)  As an Air Force brat who later became a sailor, I believe I can speak with a little authority about both of these branches.  What I didn't recognize as a child, I can recall now with greater understanding.<br>
<br>
I have served onboard 2 fast attack submarines and one ballistic missile submarine.  Sea duty has been some of the most exciting/boring/best/worst times in my life so far.  I have scrubbed thousands of toilets.  I have led my division (15 men) during times of crisis and in recreation.  I missed my second child's birth.  I have been to 16 foreign countries, places that I would have never been able to visit on my own.<br>
There is no way words written here can accurately describe the military experience.<br>
<br>
You should listen to what the vets have said.  I would NOT listen to anyone who got kicked out or left their branch of service with anything other than an Honorable (not a General, a big difference) Discharge.  Their opinions will obviously be strongly biased in a much different direction than my own, and usually make little attempt at giving an objective view.<br>
<br>
Get it in writing.  Make sure you know what &quot;job&quot; you will be getting.  Do not enlist without a guarantee of some kind of technical schooling.  (In the navy this is called a guaranteed &quot;A&quot; school.  PUSH to get a guarantee of a &quot;C&quot; shcool as well.)   Information Technology and Computer Systems are a hot commodity in the military right now, and the field is here to stay.  If you are computer savvy, this may be a good area to look into in the military.  Free training, with an excellent opportunity for successful transition back to civilian life if the military life doesn't suit you.  <br>
<br>
There are some very good promotion opportunities within the Navy.  Air Force enlisted promotions are generally slower than that found in the Navy, though it is very rating specific.<br>
<br>
Army paygrades are based on a billet structure that I am not very familiar with, but my understanding is you can find yourself getting demoted through no fault of your own if there aren't enough positions within a certain paygrade range when it comes time for you to transfer.<br>
<br>
Marine Corps is a different life entirely.  Strict discipline and regimen, but they enjoy a esprit d' corps that no other branch has.  Promotion there can vary, but their performance evaluation system is the best in my opinion.  You also need to be extremely dedicated to physical fitness.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do not hide anything from the recruiters.  If you choose a rating that requires a clearance, and darn near anything does now, it will generally turn up.  It may get by a general background check, but eventually (maybe years later) it will come out, your career is over, and you may be charged with fraud.<br>
<br>
Get as much information as possible before signing anything.<br>
Take your time.  Talk to vets AND active duty people before you sign.  Do not let a recruiter pressure you into anything.  Pressure recruiting tactics are supposed to be a thing of the past, but the &quot;non-quota&quot; goals are still what performance evaluations are based on.  The recruiter just wants you in.  He doesn't care if you are scraping seagull crap off a flight deck or if you are learing how to operate a nuclear reactor  (though the latter gets him more points). <br>
<br>
Personally, without a bachelor's degree, I don't think you have a snowball's chance in Hell of becoming a military pilot right off the bat.  The army does allow non-degree Warrant Officers to fly helicopters, so maybe you can look into that.  I've heard there is an EXTREMELY high attrition (washout) rate for the program, and the dropped candidates are still obligated to fulfill their service contract as an enlisted.<br>
<br>
There ARE programs to take top notch enlisted into various officer programs, but they are extremely selective and very competitive.  This may be an option for you in the future, but don't count on it.<br>
<br>
My final recommendation is to STICK IT OUT in college.  Finish your Bachelor's degree, even if the major isn't what your truly desired.  THEN you can talk to officer recruiters.  The pay on the enlisted side isn't bad, but it pales in comparison to the officer side of the house after your first promotion.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether you enlist or choose to try for an officer program, understand you voluntarily give up many of the rights you now have as a civilian.  The Uniform Code of Military Justice is much harsher than the local, state, and federal laws you must abide by in America now.<br>
<br>
You WILL have supervisors you detest.  You MAY have co-workers who become your best friends.  You very likely will be moved away from your hometown and separated geographically from your current friends and relatives.<br>

<br>
This statement is incorrect.  They will not demote unless you screw up.  The army plans all it's personnel movements to do the best to ensure that there are always open slots in your MOS ( not paygrade) to whereever you are going.  You can have problems getting promoted though.  It took me from when I got Specialist in 94(paygrade E-4) until Mar 99 to make E-5.  It all depends on your job and how many other people there are trying to get promoted.  You can make e-1 through e-4 in 2 years, maybe faster if you get lucky or have college when you join.<br>

<br>
Thanks for clearing that up.  As I said, I am unfamiliar with the Army promotion system.  I have heard stories about administrative demotions in senior paygrades, in cases where there were only a dozen E-9 billets in one field, so when transferred the member takes a bust to E-8 even though his evals are sat.  If Army planning is anything like Navy planning, this ends up happening now and again in some ratings, though by no means would be SOP.  But as I said, these were mainly sea stories from former Army guys that switched branches to the Navy, so I guess they were BS.  These stories were also pre-drawdown, so hopefully that system is no longer in place if it ever was.<br>
<br>
E4 for 5 years?  OUCH.  While that is a possibility in the Navy, it isn't common in my experience except for a few very tight ratings.<br>
<br>
Shnarf,<br>
Speaking of tight ratings (those where promotion is slow due to the small number of people in that field, or where the field is overmanned at one specific rank),  anything to do with Graphic Illustration or Photography is tough to get promoted in the Navy.  Navy Patternmakers, Lithographers, and Photographer's Mates have some really screwy promotion times, though most of the guys I've met in these areas really liked their jobs, even knowing they weren't going to get promoted as fast.<br>
<br>
Another really HOT field is security right now, in light of the events on 9/11/01.  All branches are increasing their numbers in these areas right now.  Many of my friends (fellow Sonar Techs) who went to shore duty to an instructor billet have been sideswiped and turned into members of the Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) because of the heightened security posture.  This is one more example of the &quot;Needs of the Navy&quot; taking precedence over your own personal desires.<br>
<br>
Once again, THINK about what you are getting into.  It is very easy to back out in the first 180 days after you sign on, though if you do it means you will never serve in the military again, even in time of war.  After that period, it is tough to get out (honorably) even if you are completely miserable.<br>
<br>
FINISH college.  Look at an ROTC program at your university.  Take a class or two in this area.  Easy to back out of that w/ no pain, and while it isn't really the military, it will give you a taste.<br>
<br>
Good Luck,<br>

I actually already dropped all of my classes today and filled out a form for withdrawl.

I feel that I'm ready for the jump. <br>
<br>
Questions about jobs. I heard that most security jobs in the military, though easy, after your enlisted service the only job you can get with the skills acuired usually is a security guard. True?<br>
<br>
What about jobs in the Air Force? Anyone have takes about which jobs are best suited for someone hoping to use the skills gathered through that back into civilian life?<br>

<br>
I recently (in July 2001) retired from the Navy after 21 years on Submarines.  I was also a Nuclear Electrician, but I think I had the best job in the world.  Yes it was hard work, yes I had to do things I did not enjoy, and yes sometimes you work for idiots (although I dont see how this differs from civilian life much).  The thing that does differ is that the Navy took an 18 year old kid who didn't have a clue what to do with his life and didn't have the money (or the grades) to go to college, trained him to maintain, operate, and ultimately supervise others in operating a nuclear power plant.  It turned me into a man with marketable skills that can be used in civilian life.  You don't have to stay as long as I did, but you may find that the job is rewarding and you want to.  I have now entered a new career as the Plant Maintenance Manager of an industrial plant in South Carolina at slightly higher pay than I made as a Senior Chief (E-8)  but with my retirement also, the pay increase is significant.  I will tell you something that many people do not believe but is absolutely true, I have never met anyone who was in the service (any branch) and did not get kicked out, who after 5 years did not wish that they had stayed in.  The comment always goes like &quot;I would be just about eligible for retirement right now....&quot; so take that for what it is worth.  Good advice here from people who know and have really given it their best effort, you will find that people who think they are smarter than everyone in the military, still feel they are smarter than everyone out of the military.<br>

AF jobs that translate well to civilian careers ... I have seen about 3 so far ... I'm sure there's more.<br>
<br>
The recruiter is going to push Security Forces on you.  He/She has a lot of quotas to fill there.  The guys I knew in SF all get out after 4 years for jobs in law enforcement.  It's practically a sure thing that a job as a cop is waiting for you if you keep a clean record.  The SF guys I knew were happy with it for the most part, and there's some comraderie there, that I have seen.  My personal advice to you is only take this option if you're interested in a law enforcement career.  The hours you work are long, odd hours, and alot of the time you'll be bored on watch.  If it's something you're not interested in, you won't be very happy.  Remember, when the recruiter pushes this on you, you don't have to take it.<br>
<br>
I'm a 3COX1 (Computer Operator), and I do Network Architecture, Systems Administration, Web Development (and more) ... Eventually, I'll probably have all the skills I need for an MSE certification.  I work steady hours, and have time for college courses.  I've seen a few guys get out after 4 years to take jobs at places like Compaq doing Sys Admin work on Web Servers.  We're a critical field, high enlistment/reenlistment bonuses.  I really like/recommend this field, and I'd suggest holding out for it.  I had to wait 3 months from the time I approached the  recruiter til the time I shipped out to get it.  Hold out for the career you want ... don't settle, and don't go open/general.<br>
<br>
I've seen that Air Traffic Control was another good job that has a civilian career waiting, as well.<br>
<br>
Oh, you can also go into Medical ... and have a career that translates well into medical administration, nursing, dental assistant ... or with your degree, anything you want in the medical world.<br>
<br>
Speaking of jobs, if I don't get going now, I'll be late getting to post.<br>
<br>
Best of luck,<br>

If there are only 3 billets open only 3 people are going to advance. And then it is the best test scores and evals that fight for them.<br>
<br>
There are some rates that almost everyone who takes them advances, but then there are some that only 2% of the people taking the test make it.<br>
<br>
I came into the Navy as an E-3, made E-4 4 months later and then took my first E-5 exam 3 months later. This is not common, but it can happen. However the possiblity of making E-5 was slim to none and so I took the test a few times. The reason for not making E-5 right away was that if I had re-enlisted for 2 more years I would have made a nice bonus 40kish, and E-5 automatically. Well you can imagine how many people DID re-enlist, so that cut the avalible billets way down for those of us who didn't re-enlist. (Just so no one jumps on this. I was a nuclear EM and I didnt like the job, so I didn't want to spend 2 more years doing it)<br>
<br>
Last I heard the Signing bouns for Nukes was up to 15k. With the star program getting as high a 45k for another 2 years and auto rank to E-5. (Remeber your bonus is taxed at 32%) You however don't get the bonus unless you pass your school. Which is almost 2years long in CHarleston, SC. So that is a 2 year wait on the 15k, it is taxed all to hell and if you don't pass you don't get it. Also the 45k star bonus is divided up in that when you sign you get half of it and then the rest is spread out over the course of your enlistment. So if you hvae 6 years left on your term, you will recieve 1/6th of it every October. And again it is taxed at 32%.<br>
<br>
This is the same for all signing bonuses. You only get them if you finish the school or term you agreed to. I don't know about other schools, but NUKE school was very hard and I saw a lot of friends get kicked out, or decide they didn't want to be there and got themself kicked out. Also my captian was a hard ass and if you went to Captians Mast you were lucky to keep the program.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking of going NUKE in the Navy feel free to drop me a line. I can also point you to about 15 other NUKE's on E-Marr in the 3 different ratings.<br>
<br>
As far as the GI Bill. You will be a fool not to take it. You only pay $100 a month for a year and when you get out you have enough to get a BA in almost any feild. If you are going to be a doctor or lawyer you won't, but you know how that goes. I am not sure you can get a signing bonus and the College fund, I am pretty sure it is an either or. ASK! That is the biggest thing, if you don't know or aren't sure ask.<br>

<br>
Kidin, as far as talking to the Navy recruiter, I'm not sure yet. I've been looking at some jobs in the Navy, the Arts and Photography really interests me, esp. the photojournalist. The student loan repayment offers and continueing education after enlistment options look really good too, as well as the traveling aspects. <br>
<br>
Going from a civilian life to a military life isn't going to be easy. I realize this. Living on a sub/carrier and leaving the States for months at a time has it pros and cons. At this point in time I'm not too sure how adjusted I'll be to that sort of living. I also am not sure how I'll adjust to living totally on my own. Granted, I did live a year in a dorm room at college, it's not quite as shell-shocking as moving away and living on a military base.  <br>
<br>
To tell you the truth I don't know what'd I'd be able to do with my free time or if I'd have free time at all. Who knows? I'd most likely just stay in my room attempting to play online video games. :P <br>
<br>
I was checking out the US AF,Army,Navy websites and found their careers section. There are a ton of them. I went through every single one and read the details/info. But, I want to get more info, behind the scenes info on the jobs, I'd like to get other people's takes on these jobs:<br>
<br>
(Air Force)<br>
Public Affairs Apprentice<br>
Still Photography Apprentice<br>
Aerial Gunner<br>
<br>
(Navy)<br>
Photojournalist<br>
<br>
(Army) <br>
Multimedia Illustrator<br>
Journalist/Broadcastjournalist<br>
<br>
As you can tell...I'm looking more in the PR sectors of jobs in the military. Getting down and dirty whether fighting or fixing things aren't my thing. Secretarial jobs filing papers and checking on needed base materials just sounds too boring. I should look more into computer technical jobs, but I like performing computer things more of as a hobby and I don't think I'd enjoy it as a job. <br>
<br>
I took the ASVAB about 3 years ago (Spring 99'), I've forgotten the actual date. Will I have to take it again? My last score was a 73, but I know I'm capable of getting a better score. In fact, I'm probably going to get one of those ASVAB 'help' books to help me study for it if I need to re-take it. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advanced to people who help me get a clearer image of the military. Thanks again to those who have already helped. <br>

 You might have to take the ASVAB again and, if you think you can score better, you can take it again anyway.<br>
<br>
 I don't know a whole lot about the JO(Navy Journalist rate) field but I did know the one we had on our ship and he seemed to enjoy his job.<br>
<br>
 If you decide to go in the computer field the two rates to try for in the Navy are IT(Information Technician) and CTO(Cryptologic Technician(Communications). While other rates in the Navy do have some network administrators jobs, these two carry the lion's share of them. IT requires a Secret clearance while CTO requires a Top Secret. Your expunged record might be a problem acquiring a Top Secret clearance.<br>
The Navy has several schools in the computer field. Ones to look for are 2735(Information Systems Administrator), 2780(Network Security Vulnerability Technician) and 2781(Advanced Network Analyst). These three schools are good schools and produced a very good reenlistment bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
My job before this one in Hawaii I worked with USAF guys. They have a pretty good deal and if you don't want to move around a lot, it seems that the Air Force will leave you in one place for a long time(one guy I worked with had been at the command for 9 years!). The Air Force has some of the best housing among the services.  But Air Force also seems to take the longest to advance.<br>
<br>
Take a look at all the services(including Coast Guard!) and ask a lot of questions. Don't let the recruiter drive the conversation. Remain noncommital, ask all the questions you want to know, and if it sounds like he/she is bs'ing you, leave and go to another office. Usually the services recruitment offices are located right next to each other so when they see you talking to the other services they tend to be more honest and less pushy with you.<br>

If you have any questions about the Navy, computer fields in the Navy, or anything about the military feel free to drop me a line at damojoogre@yahoo.com. If I don't have the answer I can usually track down someone who does.<br>

<br>
I as well am a Navy Nuke (MM2/SS) serving onboard a King's Bay boomer.  From what I have seen, i'll agree to most of the above posts about the military being a complete change of pace, and of lifestyle that is sometimes rough to get a hold on.  For you, do realize that you won't be serving on any submarines, but mostly surface ships and shore commands.  Submarines are small enough for the people we carry on them now, that we assign collateral duties to members of the crew for jobs such as what you are looking into (photo | PR | etc. ).<br>
<br>
Keep an open mind, and yes.. motrin does seem to be the root of all that is holy in military medicine =\.. that and foot powder.<br>
<br>
Make your decisions smartly, and you will perservere.<br>
<br>
Also, most ships (surf) are equipped with satellite relay classrooms, and most of those are free, where you can further / complete a degree if you wish.<br>
<br>
So i guess skimmers do have it a bit better.... sun (what's that), school, women, naaaahhhh nm that.. i wouldn't serve on a surface ship if they tripled my salary.  That's too much work.<br>
<br>
Take it as you will.  The military isn't for everyone, but for some, it's the open door to their future.<br>
<br>
Good Luck to you<br>

When I mentioned my friend the recruiter, it wasn't to have you go in his office.  It was just so you'd have access (IN game even <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) to someone who has recently been IN the fleet AND knows all the latest things that recruiters can offer (bonuses, college fund, how tight which ratings are, etc) without any of the pressure (real or perceived) of actually being in a recruiting office.  He's a good guy, even if he can never settle down to ONE character to play, lol.<br>
<br>
If sea duty makes you a little wary, I'd recommend the Air Force for Quality of Life.  I don't recommend the Coast Guard (those guys are so short-handed, they are ALWAYS going out to sea AND they do some dangerous stuff in the War on Drugs) or the Marines (unless you are really gung-ho and in teriffic shape).  I am not knowledgable enough to speak for or against the Army/Air National Guard, but I knew it wasn't for me.<br>
<br>
Just like Kintai said, if you are interested in photography and journalism, if you go to a submarine, you may be able to volunteer yourself to become the Ship's Photographer.  (Though that violates a basic Navy principle...Never Again Volunteer Yourself, which I've never managed to follow!)  You could also assist the Supply Officer, who doubles as the ship's Public Affairs officer. On my last 2 boats, this was a collateral duty for a junior E-5 or a hot-running E-4.  The Navy sent them to school, and then they took all the official (and tons of unofficial) pictures for the command.<br>
<br>
In all my time on subs, I've never fired a shot in anger in 11 years.  That includes Desert Storm and the current war.  Submarines are about the safest place to be in the Navy.  <br>
<br>
Every Journalist or Photographer's Mate (different jobs, though JO's can take pics too) I've known has really liked his job, though their field is rather slow to promote.  My JO friend who was a JO1 (E-6) jokingly would say the only way he'd make Chief (E-7) was if he killed his own boss to get the billet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You've heard from several Navy &quot;nukes&quot;.  These are smart guys.  Listen to 'em.  I have noticed a larger number of nuclear trained Navy guys who play EQ over any other rating.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    (What that means, I'll let you decide.)  If you do go &quot;nuke&quot; and make it through the schools, you have the chance to make some serious cash over and above your basic pay, especially if you make the Navy a career.  I wouldn't want their job for an extra $500 a month myself, but it may be something that interests you.  <br>
<br>
A little more about the computer fields.  Sonar Technicians and Fire Control Technicians on fast attack submarines (&amp; FT's on boomers) are the ones who go to school to become LAN administrators for the computers on the subs.  This is on top of the electronics training for their respective fields.  One thing to note though, that these schools aren't offered to everyone.  The boats pick who they send, and the electronics schools may require you to re-enlist. <br>
<br>
This is some SERIOUS training here.  Up to and including Advance Network Analysis, a school that costs about 10K by itself to attend, and the Navy sends you free after you finish your other schools.  You could receive about 100K in training for no cost to you while receiving an okay paycheck.<br>
<br>
A 73 on the AFQT is a good score, but you may want to try again to make sure you qualify for any program you are interested in.  (The AFQT is just one section of the ASVAB, and it gives you a percentile score.  The other sections give a numerical score, but they aren't percentile based.)  Ask the recruiters if a 73 is good enough to qualify you for the programs you are interested in.<br>
<br>
The websites are a great research tool.  Play it cautious and continue to gather information before making a decision.  What you are doing is smart.<br>
<br>
Good Luck,<br>
