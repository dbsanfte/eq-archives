Are people attempting to honor these entries?<br>
<br>
Only reason I ask this is because last night I was scheduled to go into ToV with a guild that had scheduled it and been planning for a week.  36 people were expecting to get in there and I, probably along with many others, took the extra effort to get all the way out there the night before to make sure we were ready.  As soon as I logged on last night I was informed that it was cancelled....that another guild had already moved into HoT.<br>
<br>
Now please let me emphasize here...I'm not laying blame on anyone, to my knowledge we haven't really developed a policy regarding this place other than that it's FFA.  It would have been nice to receive some prior warning so we could plan something else /shrug but no big deal.  It DOES however require similar planning and effort as PoH and PoF though and for that I feel bad for the raid leader that put the effort in, should HoT be treated the same on calendar?<br>
<br>
Before anyone jumps on me for whining, let me just add that FFA is fine with me.  I'm pretty confident that I could put together 2 strong groups and go in there with very little notice.  My main concern is for guilds like mine that are just getting enough peeps in the +55 category that they can attempt this with the proper time to plan it out.  Should we at least attempt to honor the calendar for this?<br>

For the most part HoT can support 2 groups, and maybe even 3 groups killing, depending on the size of the individual raids.<br>

But if you end up with 6 groups of high level people, like i've seen it happen, you can clear it all by yourself hehe. <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

That is why posting intent to raid is important for planning.  It's no fun showing up to an empty plane.  Or having to sit and wait for mobs to pop.<br>
<br>
HoT mobs respawn in 1hr 15min.<br>
<br>
     It can support 2 raids, but 1 must enter the halls which is more difficult.  The raid on the platform faces little risk other than a bad pull, or someone sitting to close to pit.  It's also a faster CR if they wipe out.<br>
     The hall raid must face roamers, and being pulled over by the other raid.  The CR can be longer.<br>
     It's not possible to share the platform since the casters use the wall to block AE, and the mobs would just add to each other.<br>
<br>
     If your goal is to mass farm armor, then you want low risk, and lots of kills.  The platform is the ideal spot.<br>
<br>
     In the past if 2 raids wanted the HoT platform, they typically randomed for it.  Also merging raids might be an option for 2 smaller raids.  Halls are not that bad if you march in with a strong experienced crew.<br>

I believe raids like poh and pof should be schedled.  I have lead those raids and know how much work is involved in those.  Hot on the other hand you just slap 1 to 4 groups together and your good to go.  Your best bet is when you want to do HoT.  Let other dragon aligned guilds know that you plan on doing it a certain time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ugusiamroa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GusiamROA</A> at: 10/18/01 12:35:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubraskdembones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brask Dembones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/18/01 12:53:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> /nod That's kinds of what I was getting at.  Is it better to use a centralized tool like the calendar for this communication? or go to each website and drop a post?  This raid last night was on the calendar so I'm guessing a more informal approach needs to be used in the future to avoid conflict.<br>
<br>
As for PoH/PoF taking more planning....yeah I'd agree with that in general, but only because lower levels are involved.  I'm sure you could whip together that 1 to 4 groups that you were going to take to HoT and they would fair just as well in either of those other planes....not that you would ever need to do that though.  But then again I'm not a raid leader, so I should prolley shut my trap hehe.<br>

<br>
Some guilds aren't well equiped, and can't do things like HoT with one group yet. Guess what it boils down to is, next time you guys go...since you've done oh so great things there is, have the balls to move into the halls and let the less equiped people have the platform.<br>
<br>
You'll actually see that getting to the named is much easier by going deep into the halls. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Kodylan Stompioras

Because the other raid can always CR us if things get messy.  I think an ideal solution to this would be that if a second raid comes in and wants to do HoT, they move deeper in and the &quot;platform&quot; raid agrees to CR them if they are wiped out.<br>
<br>
I also don't see any problem with posting it on the calendar to let other guilds know your intention.  Perhaps you should specify that you would like to hold a *platform* HoT raid and that anyone else is welcome to come and move deeper in...since a spur of the moment raid is far more likely to be equipped and experienced enough to do so. <p><center><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig7.gif" >

I posted this up here months ago, and was at the forefront of haveing HoT on the calander, but no,  everyone said keep it FFA, so we did.<br>
<br>
So we went in there, what we did not need however is the nasty tells calling us &quot;raid crushers&quot; to &quot;fooking liars&quot; because of the lack of communication from your guilds.<br>
<br>
We prob could have worked something out but those tells pissed us off, so we didnt, /shrug<br>

As for discussing this topic &quot;months ago&quot;..../shrug I didn't see the original message and at that time wouldn't have been able to offer an opinion one way or the other anyways as I hadn't been there yet.<br>
<br>
I guess all I'm looking for is some &quot;general rule&quot; to follow for this in the future.  If the Oboo decide to hold their first HoT raid in the next month or so would you recommend me dropping a post on your web page just to give a heads up?  Is a calendar posting enough? or are they basically SOL if someone feels like going in ahead of them?<br>

It's funny but all the people here who preach that the calendar is simply an information tool seem to forget that when it comes to Hot. <br>
<br>
All you are doing is informing peeps that you will be there. <br>
<br>
I could easily post on my guilds boards a planned hot raid then all trek over that at the set time only to find out that there's currently a raid in hot because Guild b did the same as me posted on their own boards. <br>
<br>
How else other then the calendar are you supposed to know if someones planning to be there? Visit every other Hot capable guild's boards and check their raid listings?<br>
<br>
In Addition to that Hot can support at least 2 raids. 1 Ent 1 exit. As soon as I get back from my happy little trip to Chicago I'm planning to host an exit raid.<br>
<br>
Also you need the calendar if you plan to hold an open raid so people have the ability to sign up now granted with hot it'ss not as big an issue but for other things it is. Now that Zland isn't a big deal with Visions I want to hold an open Zland raid and I plan to use the calendar to see exactly how many people are interested. Plan to with Vind as well. Granted for those I may just stick with the raid board for sign up rather then posting it on the calendar but why is it such a big deal if it goes on the calendar?<br>
<br>
I think I was the first person to throw hot on the calendar. And I copped shit over it. I planned a raid for the same day as MW. It was no biggy Azz just bumped his raid and even if he hadn't I woulda bumped mine or we would have joined together. Had I not put it on the calendar MW woulda shown up to find my raid already in progress (i think I was set for 1 hr before theirs) and they woulda had a whole bunch of people in a currently raided zone. Granted Azz and I woulda worked something out quite easily but my putting it on the calendar actually made things able to be dealt with ahead of time rather then talking in tells while I was trying to continue my raid to keep ahead of the respawn. What about if they showed up and then decided to move their raid...What about the peeps that had actually planned around this raid? Peeps do do that. I know I have. I've taken days off work for certain raids. Sure would piss me off to find out the day of that it was cancelled.<br>
<br>
Peeps go fucking gonzo at Visions for clearing fear w/o putting it on the calendar and mucking up a sched. raid yet if a Hot raid is planned on and they show up and there's already a guild raiding there it's no biggie? How is it different? Because Hot spawn is only 72 minutes? Oh yeah I see lots of raids only stay for 1 spawn. Hot raids normally last as long as a planar raid chances are good that if you have a raid planned for the same time another guild does yours will be cancelled. Yeah you can go in as soon as Guild A gets done and have stuff to kill (something that needs to be fixed planeswise) but you prolly will not have as long a raid as you planned to because by the time guild A is done and you get start peeps need to log sleep etc.<br>
<br>
Maybe my insomnia has faulted up my thinking but I just don't see any prob with it and only see it being beneficial.<br>

Gonna argue here with you Azzi. If your goal is to mass farm armor get to the exit and pull to there mobs in the back run about 87 percent drop rate and about 34 percent chance of dropping 2 or more pieces. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utanisemanasponge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanise Manasponge</A> at: 10/19/01 5:49:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utsulyrashadowhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 7:24:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> /nods<br>

I only been past the pit once on a raid.  There was already a raid on the platform.  I think we had about 2 1/2 groups at the start and went down the left hall from the pit.  Think the raid leaders talked it over and the other raid was pulling from the other hall.<br>
<br>
It went better than I thought.  Was a little spookey without the reassurance of an easy cr.  But was lots of fun.  A new angle to HoT.<br>
<br>
By the time we were done, there were 4 groups and had killed the named ones from deeper in.  Whenever we did the named critters from the platform it usually resulted in multiple deaths for the pull team trying to get them there.  But from deeper in the hall was a one shot deal and no deaths.  <br>
<br>
And when we left the other raid was still going stong on the platform.<br>
<br>
But should HoT be on the calander?  Don't know, most folks talk with each other between the pro-dragon guilds to arrange things.  Usually someone in the guild knows if someone is raiding in HoT, cause your guild clerics and melees usually get asked to go to fillout a raid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF00FF"><b><I>Tsulyra Shadowhawk</I></b></font><br>

<br>
I was the one about 2-3 months ago that put in GENERAL ...what to do about HOT...i said do we want to use the Calendar as a TOOL for HOT....<br>
<br>
Every guild that responded to the post said NO..there was NO need ...the raid/guildleaders could work together without the Calendar.<br>
<br>
I brought up the concerns about how is Guild A going to know that Guild B was planning a raid if it wasn't on the Calendar.  the suggestion that was given back was the raid/guildleaders would take the time to contact the other Pro-Dragon guilds either ingame or on their boards about their plans for HOT and a set night.<br>
<br>
Until this week that is the practice ROA has followed...we never looked at the Calandar for HOT again after that post.<br>
<br>
i'm not sure where to additude is coming from but I will ask Leo if we can get my old post back...because i'm 100% sure All the guilds that are current on Dragon faction (except for Bears of Oboo) are one of the guilds that agreed to these terms....I'm sorry if the old people that agreed to these terms are either no longer around or didn't pass on the information to the new raid/guildleaders however once again how are the others that agreed to this suppose to know that.<br>
<br>
<br>
and as far as the comment we could have moved in deeper...as i explained to the other raid leader...we have never moved in deeper and we have a NEW puller and i guess i could say the same thing you guys could have moved in deeper too..but for the same reasons we didn't you guys didn't either.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit<br>
took Kod's name out of a section as i was incorrect on the guild he was in.  however on another point Kod i would like to see the one group POF break you speak of being so easy. ( as we aren't talking about broken plans as HOT is never broken)<br>

I don't see the harm in posting intent to do HoT on the Calendar.  I know there has been more than one occassion where we, Vita, considered gathering a group of people and going to HoT, but decided against it when someone in guildchat would say, &quot;Guild soandso is already there, guys&quot; or &quot;isn't Guild whatyoumaycallit going there later?&quot;. <p><p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3192" target="0"><img src="http://chaosplague.homestead.com/files/mana_sig.gif" border="0"></a><br>

I believe raids like poh and pof should be schedled. I have lead those raids and know how much work is involved in those. Hot on the other hand you just slap 1 to 4 groups together and your good to go. Your best bet is when you want to do HoT. Let other dragon aligned guilds know that you plan on doing it a certain time. <br>

<br>
Hmm now what would be an easy way to let the other dragon aligned guilds know that you were headed to HoT?   Hmm maybe the Calendar?  I am not saying don't slap a couple groups together and go to HoT, but if someone has posted on the Calendar, isn't that as good as getting a tell about it?<br>

<br>
As to HoT being on the calendar. Back when I was trying to lead HoT raids for Vita Infinita, Simc brought that question up. I posted that I didn't see a need for it to be on the calendar, but I would respect a raid that was posted. It seemed for the most part, that everyone felt that way. That it didn't need to be on the calendar, but people wouldn't ignore it either.<br>
<br>
If not, then my fault for being mistaken on that.<br>
<br>
And yes, like the lovely Neesha said, I am not a member of Vita Infinita, so it's only my own opinion. But I did a lot for Vita when I was a member, and know a good bit about HoT, along with other zones...which is why I posted. <p>Kodylan Stompioras

Even if 2 raids are planned for that day it is better to work out the detail before when you don't have 40 people waiting for a raid to start.<br>

<br>
Things change though, rules change, usually for the betterment of the server as a whole.  Was PoH always scheduled on the calendar? or did it only become an issue once more guilds became planar ready?  As I said before, my guild is getting ready for their first attempt at HoT, possibly within the next month or two.  Who is next?  4 guilds now? 6 guilds 1 month from now? 15 guilds 3 months from now?  What happens when one guild decides to park 3 groups in HoT and do it every night for 2 weeks straight?<br>
<br>
We adjusted our &quot;Rules&quot; in regards to Trak, is it time to do that for HoT,  regardless of what 4 guilds agreed upon in the past?<br>
<br>
I'm kind of split on this decision because if it remains FFA it allows me to do the 2 group thing whenever I want, but at the same time it makes it really difficult for smaller guilds finally getting the levels to do this type of raid.<br>
<br>
MW? RoA? TSO? GCR? SC? anyone else I missed.....what's your opinion on where we should go from here?<br>
<br>
Let me also add that I haven't looked at the calendar since I stopped going to Hate as well.  I'd be willing to change this though if it allowed for less conflicts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usimc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>simc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sweetiepie Honeybunch</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 10:31:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> Brask <br>

Using the Caladar is something ROA always wanted for HOT...however that was not what was desided..so we went with what was desided...if you would and the other pro-Dragon guilds want to re-open the issue...ROA leadership (myself and errtai) are more then willing to come to another agreement.<br>
<br>
