I don't know what it's like to be homosexual, and I don't have any friends who are homosexual... But using logic, and only logic, I will say.. You are most likely turned homosexual through certain actions in their upbringing... I don't know why someone would choose to be rediculed and such... It just doesn't seem like the thing to do.... Personally, I'm attracted to women, and I don't see why I'd like a guy.. and .. from my point of view.. I can't see why I'd choose to like a guy.. I don't know what's so appealling about it.. So I'm going to give my opinion and say that you'll be influenced into homosexuality, but not born that way... I don't see the positive side of making the choice, if you make that choice... If it's a choice, everyone has it.. And I don't feel the need to choose that.. Why would anyone? <p>     Dauragon C. Mikado

What you describe is called practicing same-sex intercourse, which is not only done by homosexuals.  Bisexuals also practice same-sex intercourse.<br>

<br>
What makes you think homosexuals don;t understand reproduction, and practice it when the want to reproduce.  We are not talking about reproduction, we are talking about desire, attraction and sex.  Please tell me every time you have sex it is simply to reproduce...I would love to see you post that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dauragon,<br>
<br>
It may or may not be a result of upbringing, as well as something you are born with.  Those are hard to prove.  As it is hard to disprove it is a choice other than the obvious <br>
&quot;why would anyone choose it?&quot;.<br>
But either way upbringing or inherited, it is something you are, not something you choose.   Although I have heard that they have pretty much discounted it possibly being upbringing/environment.  They have taken all of the factors they believed would cause this to happen and cannot reproduce it.  Of course it is very hard to reproduce these things with accuracy.<br>

<br>
 How so? I agree we are all very different, but thats not my point. Are you saying you were put on this planet by other means then reproduction? sure there is the artificial stuff, but thats still very much the same concept that every breathing lifeform ever to exist was created from. Including you.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;So sex is based on logic? Whatever!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Read it again, never said it was. Ill break it down so you might understand. Wake up one morning and decide, Hey, i dont like women anymore, i want a big ol' harry butt instead. Or you could have the common sense and see that making a choice like that would be in no way benifitial to you or anyone else.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;Actually you know nothing about my parents. You still haven't answered why would someone make the choice.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Youre right i dont know them, but are you saying im wrong about you not being here? Coming back saying i know nothing about them isnt much of a defense.<br>
Why would someone make the choice? No friggin idea, from that sentence it seems you agree with my &quot;choice&quot; claim where other posts you say its not.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;My point was if you claim it is a choice, then everyone had the option and made the choice to be either homosexual or heterosexual, or bisexual, correct? Support your opinions.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Youre born default heterosexual, id like to see you show me evidence stating otherwise. Its the basic lifeform reproductive <br>
cycle thats worked forever. However some people DECIDE to to be &quot;alternative&quot; knowing full well the consequences then bitch when someone rags on them.<br>
<br>
Besides you have no clue what I have experience with. SO don't tell me what I do and don't have.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Once again youre trying to pick through my words looking for a comeback. Like i said, Ofcourse i cant prove that its a choice, and you cant prove that its not. Its impossible but im certainly free to give my opinion as well as you are.<br>
Moral majority agrees with me and thats all the proof i have, believe it outweighs the gay community's claim this week to why they are &quot;alternative&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;Who called it a disease? Maybe its a gift?<br>
And what gay person wants MORE rights? They just want equal rights. Your reasoning here is the most obvious case of bullshit I have seen in a long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Bullshit? I believe it was you that said...&quot;Support your opinions.&quot;<br>
If its a gift in your opinion id sure like to know how you came up with it. How is my reasoning an obvious case of bullshit? Everything i said was based on true facts or popular vote.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;What makes you think homosexuals don;t understand reproduction&quot;<br>
<br>
 Youre right, simple misuse of words i apologize.<br>
What i meant to say was- What good does it serve? Are you really attracted to the same sex or just using it as an excuse cause no one of the opposite sex would give you the time of day. Just cause you have the social skills of a Bulthar doesnt in any way, shape, or form mean you are gay.<br>
And if you would comprehend what im trying to say, you would know that im not talking about reproducing, im using the fact that thats how life exists today so why rebel against it? All in all, everything you do in life is a consequense of your actions and choices...well besides things you really inherit such as hair loss etc. And yeah someone inherited homosexuality...what does it skip generations too? ...<br>
<br>
Sheesh.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;Please tell me every time you have sex it is simply to reproduce...I would love to see you post that.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Of course everytime i have sex its not to reproduce, thats a lame attempt...<br>

Dont think im out to gay bash or anything, those are never my intentions. I have long time friends that choose to be like that and i enjoy their company.

<br>
I believe that being gay is not a choice, that as stated before, it is an effect from your upbringing.

<br>
Hmm.<br>
You say its not a choice...but part of your upbringing?<br>
So youre not born with it i guess youre saying.<br>
Curious, since when did people start letting their parents make life changing decisions for them? I mean, regardless of what you were put through YOU have the deciding vote.<br>
<br>
Youre right about it definitely effecting and all that, but effecting isnt making the choice for you.<br>

Funny from what I see of your posts you seem to always be doing the exact same thing.<br>
<br>
As far as replying to a post that was nearly a month old, I'm sorry fuckwad I never knew there was a time limit for replying to posts, I must be sure to check the rules of this forum to see if that one is in there.<br>

I believe that being gay is not a choice, that as stated before, it is an effect from your upbringing.

<br>
Yeah it makes no sense to discuss sexuality here, but then you go do that exact same thing yourself, sounds like someone forgot to pull the dick out of their mouth before they tried to speak. <p><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/rolesig.gif">

Interestingly enough, there are other species that also practice homosexuality.  Wolves and dolphins are both species documented as occasionally having members of the same sex mate for life.  Interesting that this seems to only occur among the more advanced species, and only among mammals.<br>

I agree entirely, one thing I dont understand is how gay people get offended when they get called that, does that mean straight people like me have a right to get offended if someone labels us &quot;straight&quot;? <p><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/rolesig.gif">

It's one of those things that I hear Americans talk about all the time, but I've never once heard it actually happen, or heard of it happening from a reliable source.  I'm not saying it never happens, only that in my experience it's not normal behavior.
