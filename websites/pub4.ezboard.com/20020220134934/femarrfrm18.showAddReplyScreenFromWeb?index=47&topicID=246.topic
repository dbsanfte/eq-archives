I love your way of explaining things<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  If so then I should be in prison due to all the women I screwed by mere thought! <br>
------------------------------------------------------------ Hehe, I would be in some deep shit as well.  I pasted this 'cause it points out the reason it will not happen.  'case no balance of truth and love can inflict such an action upon someone else.  It's actually pretty interesting to ponder the idea of this 'balance' and see what can be possible.  Now i don't mean balance to be a perfect 5 out of 10(no zero involved)  I mean balance which is a given, so-called, amount of love and truth in response to a certain situation or potential situation(like Triff's chilhood days of praying for snow, though it never came) &lt;--- Yes, I believe it is possible for Triff to pray for snow and it come true.  But, the neccesity of such would be only validated only by an enormous amount of 'love juice' (meaning a derivediv of love) combined with some other factor that God chooses(mabye it would be hurting someone to allow it to snow.  The 'prayer' would never know that nor would they be available to recognize such when involed with such an extreme amount of love)  So, Triff was kinda pissed off about it now snowing.  I believe that it is possible and understand some of the factors that are within MY control which are recognition and expression of love and truth.  BUT when affecting anothers life, someone has to make a decision I guess.  To be honest, I did pray for a white christmas one year.  It had been more than 50 years since the area had one.  But I told my cousin that we were going to have a white christmas anyway.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  Even a few days before christmas it was around 60 degrees.  I was starting to think that what I said wasn't important to God.  I admitted to God that it was selfish for me to wish such a thing but also gave him reasons that it would be good.  Anyway, some freak low pressure system formed off the coast, pulled moisture inland from the ocean and the coldest temperatures recorded in a long ass time or ever(cant remember exactly) came in at the same time and wammo, snowstorm dropped the most snow in a 'long ass time' also.  Anyway, I apologize if I have insulted anyone.  I know it is not as important as some of the family members mentioned in these posts, namely Lurikeen's.  Its just an example I guess of how sometimes its ok for silly, seemingly unnecessary things to happen.  Why is my oldest daughter autistic?  why can she not speak?  I wasn't pissed off at God but my wife sure was and prob still is.  Of course I understand why she is mad, and it does hurt to have a relationship with someone you love SOOOOO much but can't get them to talk back.  It hurts for my daughter to be in her own autistic world and us be out here wishing we could understand how we can help her.  Wishing that she never feel alone or not loved.  Wishing that people don't take advantage of her because of her disablility.  Praying to God that I am waiting for the time to be right where I can pray for her to be given speech.  Feeling embarassed in public when she moans instead of talking and shakes and waves around cause she needs her occupational therapist.  Meanwhile peps are looking at us like we have some inferior genetically fucked up animal as a child.  Wanting to smash their fuking face for being so damn ignorant.  Hating that my disabled daughter will someday experience the same bullshit I have experienced.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/4/01 3:35:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free Will Argument </span><hr size=1> [quote]"It hurts for my daughter to be in her own autistic world and us be out here wishing we could understand how we can help her.

I have a daughter, too. While I do not know your pain I can certainly understand it to some degree and feel what it might be like.<br>
<br>
What you courageously shared above is an excellent example as to why I would never attempt to "deconvert" a believer. There is truth and then there is love that MUST go with it. One without the other is inferior. I see that we agree on much Brutas. I will return to the topic of Free Will later. I just wanted to share and leave it here for the time being. :) <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
I want to say that the definition of free will is not &quot;the ability to transcend the laws of physics&quot; and that that idea is completely irrelevent to this topic. Free will is the ability to control your body's movements according to what you want and choose, more or less.<br>
<br>
Lurikeen, to me you come off as thinking that we are all just impotent minds trapped inside senseless bodies with little control over what the body does or where it takes us. Maybe there's nothing wrong with that view for you. But I don't think you'll be able to find any proof behind that (do note that I have not seen you post any conclusive evidence to support your point, or at least I missed it if you did). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/5/01 11:19:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free Will Argument </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Lurikeen, to me you come off as thinking that we are all just impotent minds trapped inside senseless bodies with little control over what the body does or where it takes us.

<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well, I certainly don't think we are &quot;impotent minds trapped inside senseless bodies&quot; and I really don't know what I wrote that gave you such an indication. Truth is, I don't think in terms of a duality of mind and body. Again, as I have stated before, I am more inclined towards a view of Physicalism which reduces &quot;mind&quot; to electro/physiological components of the body. I see people as an organic whole. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Now, I think you are confusing my view of Determinism with Predeterminism as evidenced by your remark above. I never at any time stated nobody has choice. I have clearly indicated that choice is caused. When I lift my index finger to press the keys on my keyboard it is because certain conditions in my body have first been met (such as my brain sending specific electro-chemical signals to my central nervous systems in response to what I see as I read your post).<br>
<br>
I have also stated my view is very complicated and would require very lengthy posts to offer a satisfactory explanation of it. Since this is a *game* board I have limited the length of my posts considerably.<br>
<br>
Concerning your charge that I have offered no &quot;proof&quot; I certainly have not. Neither have I intended to offer formal arguments to support my opinions, since this is a game board. I may be under the mistaken impression that we are all tossing around our opinions and simply shooting the shit as if we were in a bar drinking beer together. If I am mistaken be sure to let me know, and if I am I would like to see formal arguments from you proving your opinions. I have as yet to see them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Finally, you doubt I would be able to find &quot;proof&quot; to support my views. Let me recommend a couple books to you:<br>
<br>
&quot;Reason, Truth, and History&quot; by Hilary Putnam<br>
&quot;Inquiries into Truth &amp; Interpretation&quot; by Donald Davidson<br>
<br>
You will find many formal arguments and evidence galore supporting my views. If you purchase the books we can go through them chapter by chapter?<br>

I'm curious if you know more about it.]   OH also wanted to tell ya that I have been having prob getting online but when i do I have enough buyers to get the CoCW for fungi and 70k.  If your still interested that is.   And about 'proof'; that is a sensory response to a memory.  plz don't let me go into memory.  So, once again because everything is relative, 'everything' can't be proven to exist.  Heh, kind of freaky but when looking at things objectively its a true statement.  People that don't agree are basing their support on empirical data and forgetting about the 'psychological realm'.

Definition simply cancels out such a reality. Put it this way, an "X" by itself cannot meet its own face, occupying its space and time; however beginning "X" and ending "X" are able to meet as the interval of the same thing "X" not "X" relative to each other, for they have direction which makes for a seperable difference and yet have a displacement of nil. So even "nothing" is pre-Ordered, there may eventually even be a life "after death" (another contradiction) but time will not alter reality.<br>

<br>
OK, I'm game... what are you trying to say here, Misty? Especially the bit &quot;Everything relative is systematic&quot;. What does that mean? Are you pointing at relative motion between accelerated systems (Second Part of General Relativity)?<br>
<br>
The statement &quot;the blink of time cannot be a collision of all that is and all that shall be for time could not collide all itself...&quot; is poetic, but I fail to see your point. What is it? Unless the following is supposed to clarify...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Put it this way, an &quot;X&quot; by itself cannot meet its own face, occupying its space and time; however beginning &quot;X&quot; and ending &quot;X&quot; are able to meet as the interval of the same thing &quot;X&quot; not &quot;X&quot; relative to each other, for they have direction which makes for a seperable difference and yet have a displacement of nil.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the above raises even more questions as to what you are saying. I would say that &quot;time&quot; and &quot;motion&quot; are not things in themselves but are real only in relation to consciousness. So, talk of &quot;X&quot; as having spatial/temporal properties puzzles me with regard to your assertions over time. I think if you could clarify your points it would be very interesting.

We have Free Will, though we dream it should be more, or altogether mistake our common freedom yet retain inner-space for the individual liberty to take licence with reality.<br>

There is an advantage to your philosophy and that is its ability to draw conclusions quickly.  I'm sure thats satisfying for you.  But, we are talking about something not proven by science and what value 'it' might have.  Personally I htink both veiws have their advantage.  Yours I have have already exclaimed, and mine being discovery.  Both are equally important.  Without discovery there would be no science, logic, rational, practicality or empirical thought.  But like I said, both are equally important.  If I were in a position to select a person to explain the 'workings' of a computer I would select you above myself.  But if I had to select someone to 'come up' with an idea for something that would contain and process complex values with the push of a button it would not be you.  Its kind of like choosing between Isaac Asimov and the most brilliant, unimaginative engineer who ever lived. I would pick Asimov to give me an idea about future travel in space versus Neil Armstrong, who I'm sure knows alot more about rockets, space shuttles and what propels them than Asimov(I know Asimov is dead, he's just an example)  Anyway,  everyone is special, but certain ocassions call for certain tools.  Of course that is easier said than done with the ass-fucked world we live in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/urheaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rheaton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/17/01 2:39:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free Will Argument </span><hr size=1> <br>

I must disagree. If in fact Misty based her point on other's conclusions, would it stand to reason that education regarding former 'conclusions' is key to creative betterment / enhancement? Obviously, the more we arm ourselves with knowledge, the more we have to contribute to an 'inventive' idea.... Or perhaps she just copied it from a textbook somewhere.<br>
<br>
Anyone can hopefully will for anything they want. There are many things that can be seen as impossible, made possible. There are also many things that are beyond our physical capacities (flying 'solo')...or is there? Can one really move an object with only their will? Can one bend a spoon by simply wishing for it to happen? In the bible (on a religious note), Jesus say that with faith the size of a mustard seed, you can cast a mountain into the sea (Please note that i did not use quotes). Does that mean that if i wish and believe hard enough that it shall happen?<br>

Well, there have been many experiments with superposition of the two states of an ion, where the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; states of an ion have been manipulated with pulses of radiation causing both states to exist simultaneously: the effect is a single ion in two places at once. I also wonder what you mean by &quot;reality&quot;. Surely, if I am video conferencing there is an instance of myself on each video screen where I am viewed. Those token instances are real, I think. However, I will agree that &quot;X&quot; cannot be said to instantiate upon itself; where &quot;X&quot; instantiates at some temporal/spatial location ts1.

Some such constraints are the physiological processes of our own bodies. I would add that all &quot;choices&quot; are caused.<br>

<br>
I see the Existentialist coming out again, Brutas! LOL One thing I have learned is that science and logic are tools that help us come to terms with being. I don't think Misty or any others that apply logic and experience to &quot;living&quot; have robbed themselves of self reflection. Indeed, I think Misty may have quite eloquently spoke to subjectivism while at the same time did not discount it wholesale. I think your examples of Asimov and Armstrong are great and fitting. But without both we would not have the quality of society we do. It is one thing to have a sort of &quot;private knowledge&quot; and rest with it, but quite another thing to have to try to share it. In fact, some (like myself) would argue that if you can't share your &quot;private knowledge&quot; then you really don't have knowledge at all.<br>

The situation is that ppl can see I am a male character and I am known as "Misty" to them all anyway. It is something that was thrust upon me. I have no concern about wearing a name, it isn't a "girl" in this case, and isn't necessarily a "girl" name if you consider "Mistyglen" the whole name. I might have been called "Glen" and been a gal.<br>
In my own country it is not unusual to address a totally bald person as "Curly", a very quiet person will be nicknamed "Rowdy" and a redhaired person(this one is male) "Bluey", very tall ppl (male again) will be called "Tiny" and there are many which are simply unique to a single person: "Doggo", "Fossil<eldest>", "Horse<hoarse voice>", "Bung Lung<lung removed>", "Stick", "Stork" these are just some from my youth...<br>
<br>
As for Superposition Theory <Lurikeen>: I had no idea it had been advanced that an atomic ion actually possessed 2 masses simultaneously. Back a coupla posts I did raise a case that "X" not "X" due to separable difference of interval and direction and with a displacement of nil, per distinct states existing simultaneously when the interval approaches zero difference.<br>

I mean to say I proposed the interval of "X" included states of "X" not "X" with separable difference possessing direction and with a displacement of nil. I suppose a small atomic body is entitled to spin if it wants to... it doesn't get many options.<br>
<br>
Consider a particle, one axial spin defines 2 possible states (it's single charge has 180 degrees of spin then it is on the other side, notionally reversing its polarity state). When taken together its total periodic motion will constitute a standing wave (back and front). The same body could possibly have several axial spins nested in each other. Finally, a body could have 2 identical axial motions on top of each other, when all axial spins between are filled. I have absolutely no idea what results, perhaps it does not translate energy into wave amplitude; I speculate that the particle declares a bipolar State and accretes matter or some weird shit like that. Maybe it gets hoi poloi elevated Proton notions about atomic nucleii and can do an electronegativity thing with some low orbit neighboring Hydrogen isotope for a spare neutron.<br>

I'm glad.  But if you would re-read my previous post you would see that I stated that both sides of the coin create reality('reality' being whaveter pops in your head)  I didn't think I would have to go into extreme detail when describing the difference between two very broad styles of conceptualization.  But here I go.  In a Coconut Shell......the 'one' is just as important as the 'other'  BUT!!! The 'one' is accepted by society overwhelmingly more than the 'other'    ---With the knowledge that 'time' is an idea that expresses a 'process', we can understand that our life is a 'process'   HOW-fukin-EVER,  the 'trend' in todays society is thinking that Factual information which is accepted as 'truth' by the 'intellectuals' in our society, exemplify 'Reality'.  THIS IS WHAT I SAY TO THAT........Do you remember the socially accepted 'intellectuals' back in the 1400's?.....You know, the people that claimed they knew it all.....Those 'socially accepted intellectuals', for the most part, were religious fanatics.  There were also, so-called 'scientists who claimed spontaneous generation.  I'm not refering to spontaneous generation in the form of pressurized gas.  I'm refering the maggots growing out of rotted wood.  Those same people who we think are morons are the same people claiming they have all the answers today.  I'm not saying ONLY scientific thinkers are that way(as in my example of the religious freaks)  I'm only opposing science because it is the trend in todays world as religion was 500 years ago.  IMO, scientists don't dictate what reality is or even what is possible.  I say this because anyone who absolutely claims that I can't pull my cock off, stick it threw the monitor and jam it in your eye is only using, recognizing and trusting only half of who they are.  *[Please notice that I use such remarks to keep your attention and do not mean to insult you in any way,shape or form]*   I think science is wonderful and in fact I believe that science will be an important aspect in the 'Afterlife'.  I think that science is half of the adventure of life.  But, AGAIN I will say that science is to thought as religion is to feeling and its too bad that feeling isn't regarded as highly as thought, as far as belief goes.  Society already fucked up with feeling(religion) and will fuck up with truth(science) as well.  When we recognize that, we will start to combine thought AND feeling in our foundations of belief, and unlike religion whose foundation is based on feeling and ignorant logic and science which is based on thought and arrogant feeling, the unity of the two will Finally create a strong foundation.  What will bond thought and feeling?  Spirituality.  Faith, whatever the hell you want to call it.  <br>
                Ever wonder why the elderly folks are looked upon as a ball-n-chain?  Why is wisdom not important as it used to be?  I think its because we rely on science for all the answers.  Whatever though, its just my opinion.  <br>
   Oh, Lurikeen; yep existentialism was one of the philosophies I took great interest in.  Can you believe that transcendentalism was another?  Kind of freaking crazy if you compare the two but I have always liked both of them at an arms reach.  Thank God I'm not completely existentialist as I would probably be a criminal by now or a fruitball if I was completely transcendentalist.  I never intended on suming up the two to form some type of philoshophy, there are many others that are so important as well.  But those two tend to implode and explode society more than others.  And society/culture and the like are issues I take interest in.  <br>
