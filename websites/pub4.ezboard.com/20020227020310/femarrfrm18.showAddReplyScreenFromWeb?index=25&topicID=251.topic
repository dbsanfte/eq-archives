You are such a dumb ass, but have no understanding why you fail. Oh, well, good luck to you. BTW, I recommend you clean the engine block out of your front yard and obtain a real education. I know it is difficult for you and the best you can do is swear and read from Webster's. I can only recommend motorized transport to move your parent's trailer. You may loose connectivity to the internet, Triff, but since you are just 14 years old (well, act like it) it should not matter. After all, you probablly spend most of your waking moments drooling on yourself or feeling yourself. Most likely both. Well good luck retard.

Ah, no! Your position is the least bit clear since you have yet to state it. But, I would expect a red neck like you to think you actually had something of value to say, but really you don't. Enough Miller or Bud make you think you were smart Trech?<br>

Not have I only addressed the &quot;dribble&quot; I have provided quotes from texts in my suppport. Alas, though, you were trying to read a serial number off of an engine block in your front yard and failed to read the posts in this thread. Oh well, Trech. I can recommend secondary schools for you.

That was my viewpoint. Im going to try one more time for you since you are clearly mentally impared. The argument is whether or not the articles in question were valid viewpoints. They were the ideas and opinions of the authors. By definition they were their viewpoints. They were also based on evidence that has yet to be disproven. So they were valid. Nowhere in the definition of &quot;valid&quot; does it say there has to be unbiased and clear cut evidence. By definition it was a valid viewpoint. Why is that so hard for you to understand? You eat paint chips as a child maybe?<br>

I can feel your temperature rising all the way over here Lurikeen. You havent said anything in your last 4 or 5 post relating to the issue at hand other than the trite and simple &quot;redneck&quot; insults. Combine that with the fact that it takes you multiple posts to get a single line of rhetoric across and I begin to think that youre getting as angry as a 3 yr old about to throw a tantrum. <br>

I expected as much from you Trech. :) I refuted your argument. I have said this now three times, so I am done saying it. You want to keep saying that I never respinded to your lame ass questions go ahead. Let me tell you though, when dumb asses like you ask questions like "what does 2+2=" I have no reason to answer. I suppose you should ask more intelligent questions. Maybe you should make more intelligent remarks? Of course, I know that juveniles such as yourself can only deal baser topics and have no REAL life experience to talk from. I congratulate you dumb ass (Trech) for how far you have gotten. Wish to continue on do you? I believe you haven't what it takes. Come back when you are sufficient level for this quest. BYE Bye! /waves<br>

And here you go trying to sway the argument back to stupid insults. what a riot. Thats fine. If you dont want to debate the point of valid viewpoints anymore thats fine. This is about the 5th post where you refuse to get back to the point. I wont keep going if you have nothing left to say to the original topic because unlike losers like you, I have  a job a family and friends that require my time, not leaving much to sling insults with someone who claims to be the mental superior. (which is an enigma in itself) I have no doubt you have some loser response ready so <br>

I am going to give you the easy way out, Trech. Only because I am bored with your childish wit. You don't know what the fuck you are talking about. How old are you Trech? 14? Maybe 18? Let me tell you Trech... once you have made it through puberty come back here and talk like you have half a brain. Up to now you aren't even a challenge and you certainly have had nothing substantial to share.<br>
<br>
/yawn<br>

I tire of your juvenile remarks and will make this my last response. Bye bye, Trech<br>

<br>
I don't believe Bush is being communist or anything of the like, but if you step back and pick at the article (and remove biased remarks) that what it looks like to me.<br>
<br>
We have most of the country involved in the highest state of patriotism since WWII, to capture Bin Laden now would bring that to a close. Peple would go back to the &quot;let the world deal with their own problems&quot; B.S. I'm sorry but as any good politicain would do Bush's going to play it out until the end, and then beat it like a dead horse.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I didn't vote for the man for a reason.<br>
<br>
This country stands for alot, and now that the people are backing it, and his ratings just keep climbling, he can and WILL play it out until the next election.<br>
<br>
Bet ya 5 buck we catch OBL after Bush gets re-elected.<br>

Aoladari, I believe you are giving Bush much more credit than he deserves. I don't believe he is that smart or even that conniving. However, I do agree with you that he will &quot;beat it like a dead horse&quot; come election time.<br>
<br>
However, US citizens tend to not give our Presidents credit for victories on foreign soil. George W. Bush senior lost re-election to Bill Clinton even though Bush senior had a very high approval rating going into the election due to how he handled Desert Storm.<br>
<br>
I think US citizens will reel under the pain of a worsening economy once the dust settles in New York and we count our loses much more closely. Personally, I think most Americans want to see Osama bin Laden butchered (count me amongst them!). Once we have victory over the bastards who bombed us, we can turn our attention to domestic affairs and that is where Bush is a chump. He will probably lose re-election because he know jack about how to run an economy. Err... I think I will do the same as you did...<br>

Bush has enough people to do the work for him in this issue. It'll only look like he's doing it because someone has their hand up his ass pulling the puppet strings. I've always had that feeling about him, like he's no better than a puppet.<br>

Very true, however that war was not a result of something that happened on our soil. With the WTC attacks, everyone will remember all the speaches Bush has made, to make everyone feel better about themselves, our country, and our military. <br>

My boyfriend actually wants to see him drawn and quartered. I personally wish we could bring back some of the most horrible dark ages torture devices and give 'em a spin on old ObL.<br>

He will only lose the re-election (IMO) if he has beaten ObL and the Taliban by re-election time. Thats why he'll draw everything out and he will put the economy on a shelf until further notice. <p>Aoladari Raveynfyre <BR>
