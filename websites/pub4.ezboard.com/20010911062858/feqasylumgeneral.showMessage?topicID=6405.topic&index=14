Do what you want.  Speak how you will.  Just remember that some people prefer to be treated with respect regardless of race and class.  They are after all people.<br>
<br>
Personally if I played a Dark Elf, I would be the nicest person ever.  I would show that not all Dark Elves are mean and nasty.  And then I would use you to serve the will of Innoruk.  Oh don't worry, you would get your share of Phat Lewtz.  But you need to help me kill halflings that keep beating on my friends and family.  We would have to slay those nasty guards that think I am a threat.  Heck, by the time we got done, You might have friendly faction with Mistmoore types.  You would be soooooo used.  If I played a gnome, I think I would get lost in tinkering.  I have no idea what class I would play as gnome, but what ever it was I would constantly be talking about the complexities and intracacies of the components and mechanisms in a collapsible fishing pole.<br>
<br>
And you do not have to do what everyone else is doing for roleplaying.  Just because you are of a particular race/class/religion does not mean that you have to act the way everyone expects you to.  For example....<br>
<br>
An erudite necromancer that wants to abolish disease by studying it.<br>
<br>
A Paladin of Karana that will bible thump all that do not worship the power of the storm.<br>
<br>
An Iksar shadow knight that seeks to form alliances with Honorable types in hopes of reclaiming Kunark.<br>
<br>
A disgruntled Druid that has decided to destroy all that once was under her protection because a bear killed her son.<br>
<br>
Then again don't we already have....<br>
A bible thumping zealot that is so blinded by her faith and devotion to her kind that she has not noticed that she has adopted a philosophy of hate that has made her much like her sworn enemies?<br>
<br>
A guild of evil types that have united under the way of god that is not even part of the game and operate under a policy of family is more important than loot and is lead by a troll with ruby slippers?<br>
<br>
A Wood elf druid that married a Troll warrior (as wells as an Iksar monk that is married to a dark elf cleric)?<br>
<br>
An ogre warrior that would rather be a bard and eat cookies with friends?<br>
<br>
Some people that want to play nice and honorable?<br>
Some people that want to be mean and nasty?<br>
<br>
Yes, we have all that and more.  Pretty cool, huh?<br>
<br>

My first reaction when was asked to join a group with a dark elf, I thought &quot;No way! Dark elves are evil!&quot;. If that wasn't for the friend who introduced me to EQ and who was with me, I'd have refused that group and would most probably have become like Felishanna, a total roleplayer.<br>
<br>
He told me that the players who played dark races were not acting evilly and that at high levels, most of them were even warmly welcome by the paladins in Freeport.I think that's where I realised  the difference between &quot;evil players&quot; and &quot;evil characters&quot;. From that moment, I ceased to roleplay permanently.<br>
<br>
I like to roleplay when I meet other roleplayers and it's really a nice part of EQ. But most of the time, people don't care about roleplay and are only interested in levelling and getting loot. Personally I find it a bit sad because roleplaying is so much fun. But everyone has the right to play the way he/she wants.<br>
<br>
I noticed most of the people here talk about roleplaying as the way they talk to other people or in /shout. If I don't always roleplay that way, I almost always roleplay in acts. I never kill friendly NPCs for example (like the guards in BB, Steamfont or Misty) and I will never raid PoG with my druid even if lots of nice equipments drop there for him. I do some quests just for fun even if the reward is useless to me. Etc...<br>
<br>
I know some people will never understand that but I don't ask them to. For some, EQ is a quest for power, a race to 60 and the raids in ToV or ST to get phat lewtz. For some, it's a way of meeting people and make friends. For most, maybe a bit of both...<br>
<br>
As for Felishanna... Many people are pissed at her because doesn't help dark races.<br>
<br>
First, noone HAS to help someone else. People help when they want to. How many times did you die while people were watching you and laughing because they found it fun? At least, Felishanna has a reason to let people die.<br>
<br>
Same for rezzes. No cleric HAS to rez anyone. Clerics rez when they want to. When you ask a cleric to rez you and he answers &quot;sorry, busy atm&quot;, maybe he is busy but maybe he simply doesn't care. Again, Felishanna has her reasons to rez someone or not and noone has the right to force her to do otherwise.<br>
<br>
She has a set of rules of conduct that she's been playing with for such a long time and she couldn't break any rule even if she wanted. Everyone would jump at her throat saying she was a liar and a faker. Now she has her rules and can't change them. (And I don't think she'd like to anyway. Am I right Felishanna?)<br>
<br>
She acts according to her beliefs and for that I respect her much. I know I could never do like her because I'd feel too guilty (and maybe she feels guilty too sometimes). I can understand that someone wouldn't share her beliefs but I don't understand why some people feel the urge to flame her continuously. I guess it's the price to pay for thinking differently...<br>
<br>
Just another thing. Some people talked about racism. I don't know if they are familiar with heroic fantasy but in every fantasy stories I read, high elves good, dark elves are evil and they hate each other to the death (except for Drizzt who is good and hated by everyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
It's not reality, it's a fantasy world where each race has a moral attribute (not like reality and note that in fantasy stories, humans are maybe the only ones to have both good and bad people). Felishanna doesn't play a racist, she just plays an elf and elves hate dark races. Unless you wanna say that elves and dark races are racists because they hate each other. Also think about iksars, hating and being hated by every other races.<br>
<br>
And last, agnostic doesn't mean neutral. Agnostic means you don't believe in a god. Dark elves are evil, agnostic or not. And if you wanna roleplay a dark elf who is good or neutral then prove her that you're not evil! I agree, it would not be easy but think of the effort to be not kos in Neriak or Cabilis for a good elf. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If you roleplay hard maybe you could convince her. (Good luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>

<br>
When you read a book.. thiose characters never fall OUT of character, but they do give people a chance here and there. There are even books where sworn enemies will band together or lend a hand just because it's the RIGHT thing to do. <br>
<br>
Now, my only quarrel with Felishanna (who I at one time idolized for her ability to &quot;roleplay&quot; without interruption) is that she condemns everyone, regardless of who they are in the game. It's just outright prejudice when played out that way, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> she has the right to be that way</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, but it isn't very becoming in my eyes. <br>
<br>
When I most needed help in the game she offered her help... on the condition that a lot of the group remain at the zone because if they got aggroed they weren't getting heals, and when they died she wasn't going to help them. No, this isn't a flame at all, what i'm doing is pointing out that there is a line between reasonable and unreasonable. <br>
<br>
My ranger (when roleplaying) is a good character, but she also feels that she has no right to condemn a person for the color of their skin or the nature of their class. At least not until she knows a little about them, a little about who they are... They are people, and as my RL mother used to say... Evil can conceal good, and good can be hiding evil, it's all about if you're willing to dig below the surface to see what's really there. <br>
<br>
I hope this made some sense, and I hope i'm not repeating anyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;runs off to read the rest of the thread now&gt; <p><center><img src = http://happytiger.homestead.com/files/xianlesig.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uzathule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zathule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>h0x0r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(8/14/01 2:14:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: roleplaying</span><hr size=1> When you really think about it, everyone in EQ is roleplaying all the time.  Now when you look at what most people(their ingame characters) are roleplaying you see the dominate style is a focus on gaining personal power and materialistic wealth.  They are willing to forego any meanful interrationships which are not linked to gaining skills and possessions.<br>
<br>
The debate is framed around 'roleplayers vs non-roleplayers' but when you look at it everyone is always roleplaying.  It is just that many/most are roleplaying the same old type of character.  How many people(IRL) have a character background in their minds or on paper? Or any ingame distinct style which is different from other characters that they play?<br>
<br>
There are some people who do have distinct play styles and some kind of overriding goals which extend beyond their next XP kill, rare loot, or uber mob encounter.<br>
<br>
You also need to look at what we are provided with in the world of EQ.  Our actually RP range in the game is very limited like others have mentioned.  Plus we have to consider that there are real people on the other side of their avator, so will sometimes override the actions of our own avators.<br>
<br>
When I consider how my main character, an Iksar necromancer and follower of the Dreadlord Cazic Thule would treat other peoples in the world of Norrath, it would just not be a happy RP experience for me.  This sets up a two class system.  I treat player characters for the most part as I would treat people IRL.  However NPCs are treated much like the gamesystem would want a broodling of cabilis to treat them.  <br>
<br>
You never know if the person behind that avator in-game is having a bad day/week/month/year in their life and looking for a temporary escape from day to day pressures.  I dont need to add more grief in this virtual world.<br>
<br>
With that said, Felishanna's RP style is well known to virtually the whole server. It should come as no surprise that what she defines as the 'evil' types will not get any support from her.  I admire her dedication to her RP style, and it adds to my game experience (even though I have rarely interacted with her ingame).  The reverse holds true for my character(zathule),  if I saw her in trouble zathule would stand by and let her die without any aid, unless it suited his purpose to help her in someway (possibly as an attempt to subvert her own eithical system--yes, necros are twisted. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  This could provide for some interesting RP.  After all, it does get tiring to always go around killing mobs and taking their belongings.<br>
