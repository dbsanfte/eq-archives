I muttered, &quot;ringing the hook off to the floor--<br>Only this and nothing more.&quot;<br><br>Then, distinctly I remembered I was to be a Raid member,<br>And jumped, my body first stiff then limber, threw the covers to the floor.<br>Hurriedly I reached through thin air;--vain I groped for what I'd left there<br>On my nightstand wond'ring just where--just where I'd left my phone before--<br>For the call to ask to be awaken'd I'd place upon my phone the night before--<br>Never to be tardy evermore.<br><br>And the sinking sad uncertain feeling as the bells of 8 soon to be pealing<br>Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic anxiety ne'er felt before;<br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>&quot;'Tis only Perils entreats my entrance to the game for sure--<br>I won't be late in entrance to the game for sure;<br>Never was I late before.&quot;<br><br>Presently my voice grew stronger;
