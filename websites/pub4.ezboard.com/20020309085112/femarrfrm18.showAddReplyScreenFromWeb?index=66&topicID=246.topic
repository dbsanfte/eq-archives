I'm glad.  But if you would re-read my previous post you would see that I stated that both sides of the coin create reality('reality' being whaveter pops in your head)  I didn't think I would have to go into extreme detail when describing the difference between two very broad styles of conceptualization.  But here I go.  In a Coconut Shell......the 'one' is just as important as the 'other'  BUT!!! The 'one' is accepted by society overwhelmingly more than the 'other'    ---With the knowledge that 'time' is an idea that expresses a 'process', we can understand that our life is a 'process'   HOW-fukin-EVER,  the 'trend' in todays society is thinking that Factual information which is accepted as 'truth' by the 'intellectuals' in our society, exemplify 'Reality'.  THIS IS WHAT I SAY TO THAT........Do you remember the socially accepted 'intellectuals' back in the 1400's?.....You know, the people that claimed they knew it all.....Those 'socially accepted intellectuals', for the most part, were religious fanatics.  There were also, so-called 'scientists who claimed spontaneous generation.  I'm not refering to spontaneous generation in the form of pressurized gas.  I'm refering the maggots growing out of rotted wood.  Those same people who we think are morons are the same people claiming they have all the answers today.  I'm not saying ONLY scientific thinkers are that way(as in my example of the religious freaks)  I'm only opposing science because it is the trend in todays world as religion was 500 years ago.  IMO, scientists don't dictate what reality is or even what is possible.  I say this because anyone who absolutely claims that I can't pull my cock off, stick it threw the monitor and jam it in your eye is only using, recognizing and trusting only half of who they are.  *[Please notice that I use such remarks to keep your attention and do not mean to insult you in any way,shape or form]*   I think science is wonderful and in fact I believe that science will be an important aspect in the 'Afterlife'.  I think that science is half of the adventure of life.  But, AGAIN I will say that science is to thought as religion is to feeling and its too bad that feeling isn't regarded as highly as thought, as far as belief goes.  Society already fucked up with feeling(religion) and will fuck up with truth(science) as well.  When we recognize that, we will start to combine thought AND feeling in our foundations of belief, and unlike religion whose foundation is based on feeling and ignorant logic and science which is based on thought and arrogant feeling, the unity of the two will Finally create a strong foundation.  What will bond thought and feeling?  Spirituality.  Faith, whatever the hell you want to call it.  <br>
                Ever wonder why the elderly folks are looked upon as a ball-n-chain?  Why is wisdom not important as it used to be?  I think its because we rely on science for all the answers.  Whatever though, its just my opinion.  <br>
   Oh, Lurikeen; yep existentialism was one of the philosophies I took great interest in.  Can you believe that transcendentalism was another?  Kind of freaking crazy if you compare the two but I have always liked both of them at an arms reach.  Thank God I'm not completely existentialist as I would probably be a criminal by now or a fruitball if I was completely transcendentalist.  I never intended on suming up the two to form some type of philoshophy, there are many others that are so important as well.  But those two tend to implode and explode society more than others.  And society/culture and the like are issues I take interest in.  <br>

Well, there have been many experiments with superposition of the two states of an ion, where the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; states of an ion have been manipulated with pulses of radiation causing both states to exist simultaneously: the effect is a single ion in two places at once.<br>

  Anyway you can give me the source for that?  A freind as I were debating on Time travel and I stated that it is possible to reverse or fastforward the growth, occurence, time,process(whatever you want to call it) of such things as vegetation and pretty much anything but probably only one thing at a time.  Until we find a common denominator amongst all life forms at which time we will be able to change time amongst all things.   Anyway, my friend used the old &quot;two pieces of shit can stink the same exact place at the same time&quot;  I told him i thought that theory was full of shit but I didn't have a 'Scientist' to back me.  BUT NOW I DO!!!!! and I want to rub it in his face and tell him, &quot;see this shit, its occupying the same place your shit comes from;  your mouth&quot;  Slightly diffeent arguement but the info still works.  <br>

One thing I have learned is that science and logic are tools that help us come to terms with being.-----<br>
<br>
  Yea, I totally agree and one of the ways you can tell I agree is that I believe science will be much of what we are in the afterlife.  Very useful shit.  No, I don't think we are going to die and automatically know all the answers.  We will epxlore and use science as a 'tool' in that exploration.<br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen-----<br>
I don't think Misty or any others that apply logic and experience to &quot;living&quot; have robbed themselves of self reflection.-----<br>
<br>
  Actually I think its impossible or near impossible to Not intro and retrospect.  Even person most in denial can't do that.<br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen----<br>
But without both we would not have the quality of society we do.-----<br>
  Yep I agree completely.  Look at it positively and negatively.  I do, and it gives me a fair perspective on the good and bad of both.  I'm not saying that everything in the past was bad or nowadyas.  Just touching on a particular topic which I believe has a a negative impact on people in todays society.  But, its all part of the process.  Growth.<br>
<br>
Quote  Lurikeen-----<br>
  Don't really understand what you are getting at there.  But I do know how it feels to express your experiences feelings etc.. and someone else stomp on it and tell you how you are far from correct.  Mmm, as far as I can remember, 99% of what I have wrote are ideas I have realized and not ones I have taken.  Of course everything builds upon its self.  Not saying that everyone should have their own ideas.  But I do think its important for people to intro/retrospect about themselves and their life.  But I wouldn't say that all people should do it as much as I do.  Just like I wouldn't read and write(taking this guess based on your writing skills) as much as you in order to be a literate person.  That is not my thing.  I'm not good at it.  But I should strive to better myselfin that arena.  But that goes back to Asimov and Armstrong.  Respect due where respect is earned.  <br>
  <br>
  I find it interesting how people(not excluding myself) read something, pick out what they want to flame, then, depending on how irritated they are, proceed to provide a tiny prick of gratitude.  Like I said, not excluding myself; just one of the many observations.  <br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen-----<br>
  It is one thing to have a sort of &quot;private knowledge&quot; and rest with it, but quite another thing to have to try to share it. In fact, some (like myself) would argue that if you can't share your &quot;private knowledge&quot; then you really don't have knowledge at all.------<br>
  This one again because I like it alot.  This is an example of why people can't get too upset with pthers when they don't agree.  Cause when someone goes out on a limb and expresses themselves, they are willing to take a hit for what they believe in.  Passion.  In a sense, passion is a link between love and truth.  Not necassarily pure love and truth but it does seem to be that way.  thats how I want to die.  Fighting for what is right.  I want to be a maurader for love and truth.  But like I said, the perception a person has of 'pure' love and truth is not necassarily 'pure'    But they do have some kind of valid point regardless if how small.   WOW this post is geting long.

<br>
Science and logic is certainly a building process, but it also takes a good deal of fantasy (theory) to reach beyond the constraints of known fact. It is the 'what ifs' that change the world. It is those people that theorize that life exists beyond our planet, thus causing them to build a craft of sorts to 'mail' to mars in hopes of discovery. The facts is what gets us onto the planet's surface, the discovery is who knows..Perhaps nil, the genius is the design (creation) of the spacecraft that will get there, and the whole dang thing that drives us to want to know is? Creativity, hope, guessing, dreams. We don't need to know anything about Mars...but we want to just for the fun of it.<br>
<br>
Love is classified as an emotion. It is something that we claim we do or do not have, it is varied extremely from one individual to the next and it lacks consistency. Anything that lacks consistency can not be factual...only speculation. The biggest misconception among 'scientific individuals' is that &quot;..if it isn't know fact it doesn't exist..&quot; yet it is these same people who will argue that life &quot;must exist outside our planet&quot;. So, IMO it is those people who make great religious leaders and great scientist are those with the courage, intestinal fortitude, bravery, and tenacity to dare believe beyond science ...to dare believe beyond 'known facts'. <p><B><font color=#00dd00>Rh</font><font color=#00cc00>ea</font><font
