<br>
Glorifundel.  The man who drops some very impressive items to his younger friends at random intervals.  The man who spends a few hours helping out his friends, (and others) handle areas they couldn't do alone.  The man who taught ME what it is to be kind, considerate, generous and helpful.<br>
<br>
The idea that because he has associated himself with assholes at times is NOT a sign of poor character or of a bad person.  It is merely a lapse in judgement for a brief moment, OR not knowing the person's reputation.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say that I have added a Guild to my list of people I hold no respect for due to this.  If a Guild Leader supports, even ADVOCATES marking someone because of their associations, I will never hold any respect for that leader, and thus the Guild in general.<br>
It sickens me to see the pathetic ramblings of morons continue.<br>
<br>
Looks more like a raid gone bad and a Guild Leader seeking someone to blame.  A lot of honorable folks would openly admit that THIS happened, and THAT part was MY fault and THIS art was HIS fault etc etc etc.<br>
This is nothing more than a witch hunt for a man who holds more honor and dignity in his ring finger than the people shitlisting do in their entire lineage.<br>
Stick to the Pricks like the one who apparently headlined this post than upstanding people who have been seen with him.<br>
The more mature and intelligent folks who visit here have better things to do than read your mindless drivel.<br>
<br>
<br>
*I would also like to add that my comments may seem harsh, demeaning and volatile and that they are my personal feelings.  My Guild, although supportive of Glorifundel generally tries to temper my responses.  Heavens knows how they'll feel about the mouth of the guild shooting off like this*<br>

This is the first time That I have posted on the Shitlist so my name may be new to you.<br>
  I have been a member of the Lanys Community for along time and hopefully My name carries with it a good reputation.<br>
  Anyways the reason I am making this post is because I am a very proud member of Iris and think that something needs to be said.  <br>
  Note: I speak here for myself and not for my guild as I am neither and officer nor leader.<br>
<br>
 1) I judge people by my association with them and there actions towards me or my friends / guild.  I do not hold past actions or reputation against anyone as all of us have done things that we are not proud or have had some kind of misunderstanding with someone which has resulted in them being P.O'd or talking smack.<br>
<br>
 2) I am aware of the INCREDIBLE amount of negativity associated with Uzziell and his alternates.  I am aware of the ferverent warnings in associating with him.<br>
<br>
 3) Lets assume that all members of Iris are at least as smart and informed as I am ( probably alot more : ) )<br>
<br>
  Now those thing said lets get on with it.  I have grouped with and talked to Uzziell on several occasions and have not seen him act in anything other then an honorable / patient ( as his knowledge of zone/mobs/quest/loots is far more vast then mine ) and courtious manner.  He has been helpful not only to myself but in many guild functions.<br>
<br>
  My point is that NO ONE is beyond redemption and I do mean no one.  I sit back and I look at this thread and I am absolutely amazed that this has gone on as long as it has.  I am amazed at the amount of repetition there is.  I am amazed that for over a year and a half now, apparently, the same core group of people, have had nothing better to do then to keep slinging mud.  I personally know alot of people who have posted here and I am not pointing fingers specifially at anyone but honestly.  At what point do we just let it go, at what point do we stop pointing the fingure at anyone associated whatsoever with Uzziell and at what point do we find it within ourselves to forgive.<br>
<br>
  I would rather have the entire server point there finger at me then let a Mob dictate to me who and who not I should associate with.  If I have made myself a target here then so be it, but if anyone who reads this agrees with me that EVERYONE has been sufficiantly warned and has the freedom to associate with whom they want.  Then please for the love all that.... well never mind that.... just drop it for shit sakes and let the lanys community get on with life.  A year and a half or more is enough<br>

<br>
Died a few deaths to people not EBing me...<br>
<br>
there was a post for about a week on the LCG boards, and I signed up for it.<br>
<br>
From what I saw when I got there was Iris trying to but out a little guild from their raid.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against big guilds, uber guilds small guilds... he to his own. But when an uber guild just by passes another because they have numbers or know what they are doing, or have done it 100 times before is no excuse.<br>
<br>
I told Gor this and that Lyriannia should lead the raid... true she didn't have the exp that Gor did leading the raid, but so what? when is she going to learn? when is anyone going to learn.<br>
<br>
Gor is not the saint you are making him out to be. I never met him untill that night, but he left a bad taste in my mouth from square one... <br>
<br>
Lyriannia I am sorry that these people are being so mean to you. I support you 100% and agree with you totally. <br>
<br>
There are always a few bad eggs in every guild... I am not saying Gor is one of them, but he just dosn't realize that theres more to the game then loot.<br>
<br>
If anyone thinks I am a jerk for this post, or if you will hate me after you read this, or will lash out at me for saying these things. who are you to judge me? <p><center>

I wasn't leading the raid and had no intention to, and in the end didn't lead it.  And obviously you couldn't see my multiple tells to lyriannia asking if she wanted us to leave.  I let her have complete control of the raid, and kept my coments in /shout to a minimum, hell her puller didn't even know how to pull phinney the way she wanted him to.  she asked me to show him down to phinney room and explain to him what she wanted him to do, and so I did.<br>
<br>
I'm a relatively patient person, but after 4 hours of killing nothing but seahorses I said I'm going to pull him to zone now, and then did it.  If I left a sour taste in your mouth I'm sorry but my cleric was supposed to be home with his family way before I pulled phinney, and unforuntately was the 4 hours in KK was the cause of a small fight with his wife =/<br>
<br>
once again, I believe I was more than patient and kind to lyriannia, and the raid that was following her.<br>
<br>
I don't think your a jerk, however I know you didn't see my /tell's to her, and unfortunately I didn't log the conversation as it seemed to me everything was sorted out, and everyone was happy, or at least satisfied.  If I had you could see for yourself.<br>
<br>
as I said before as far as I'm concerned this matter is over, but I will continue to defend myself as new posts against me are made.<br>

PS.  not that I don't try to accomodate people who setup raids beforhand on calanders, but phinney is a hard raid to &quot;post&quot; for, most people just go after him when hes up and they have the firepower for it.  And unfortunately I don't have the time to sift through every guild board on lanys to figure out whos doing what and where.  I prefer playing the game than checking message boards, which is why this is getting tiresome.<br>

<br>
and yes - Falwith's comments came from him - and yes i asked him to point out that his views are his views, and are not official CoP views - but many of us agreed with them - but it would not be appropriate to state them here<br>

In short - we have not commented on Uzziell at all - we do not know him - but we will continue to post to defend Glori if needed <p><center>

So, since it was not my intention to &quot;shitlist&quot; Glorifundel and from what he has said in his posts, he did the best he could in a difficult situation, there is no reason to sully his reputation.<br>
Thus, I have decided to delete my posts here and at my message board.<br>
However, please be aware the neither I, nor my guild will ever be bullied into or out of anything we do.  Being a level 40 plus guild with over 50 members we are not easily intimidated and can function quite well on our own.  If we post, we post.  If we chose to raid, we raid.  <br>
Yet we also try to follow a code of honor and fairness and follow the rules Verant has set very closely.  We do not wish others harm and would prefer to make friends rather than enemies.<br>

<br>
Very nice!  You don't take this list very seriously, because we're mostly ten year olds (or have the average intelligence there of).   <br>
<br>
Why come here if you don't take it seriously......was it necessary to make disparaging remarks about the posters?  <br>
<br>
For the most part after your initial posts, all the replies were well written and coherent.  <br>
<br>
IF you are going to apologize to anyone for anything, it is usually a good rule of thumb NOT to insult anyone in the same post.<br>

I am quite insulted for myself and MOST of the people who post here. You apparently wanted us to take your side then you go and insult us. Most of the people who post here actually care about the game *more* than your average 10 year old. <br>
<br>
In trying to redeem yourself for Glori's bashing you go and make yourself look even worse to the community who actually give a shit about the game enough to post here. Take these boards seriously as I'm sure Mirr and myself aren't the only ones who take offense to this comment and good luck cleaning this up. I expect to see you edit your post shortly so you can get back a little bit of the respect you may have scraped up with your weak semi-appology.<br>
<br>
Not trying to hijack this thread, and I'm glad the situation is resolved between you and Glorifundel but your comment was completely out of line. <p><center><img src="http://www.members.accesswave.ca/~falwith/Screenshots/Neosig.jpg"><br>51st Season Love Paladin<br>Officer of Coalition of Power<br>"One day, man will look back and say that I gave birth to the twentieth century"</center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uneotrunx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neotrunx</A> at: 1/28/02 1:34:00 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umagikemperor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magik Emperor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/28/02 5:21:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=138>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uzziell</span><hr size=1> Oh Vlad, it's very sad to see that you think he's so trustworthy.  Allow me to introduce myself, I am Gahleon Spiritstorm, officer &amp; member of Monarchy of the Dead for a year now.  Now, I know how you feel, I once thought of Uzziell as a good trustworthy person too, that trust diminished more &amp; more everytime I saw Uzzi not get his way, I've witnessed his tantrums, &amp; I was there the day he decided to take my guild's trust &amp; throw it back at us when he decided uberness is more important than friends or trust, it was that day that he showed his true colors.  Then, he joined the Riders of the Apocalypse, he was in that guild for what, 3 days?  It only took him that long to throw a temper tantrum &amp; be thrown from the guild, then he wrote some touching goodbye, &amp; yet he's been on nearly every day since, now he has joined Iris, &amp; well, yes, he will be a good person, someone you can trust......he doesn't get his way or something goes wrong, then perhaps you'll see the person he really is.  &amp; with that I take my leave, good day. <p>Gahleon Spiritstorm<br>
