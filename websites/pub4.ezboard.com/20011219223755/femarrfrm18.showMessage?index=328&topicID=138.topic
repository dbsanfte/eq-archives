You asked why I chose the Christian God.  Quite an involved question, but I'll do my best to be quick at the answer.<br>
<br>
Before I do - one thing.  Science does NOT = reality.  Science is knowledge gained by observation, experimentation, and study in order to determine the nature of what is being studied.  Reality is what is real - what is fact.  My reality is not yours.  I believe God exists.  You do not.  Both facts.   Who is right?  Regardless, God is supernatural.  Not natural.  How do you scientifically study the supernatural?  As best you can.  And I think many have done the best they can with the existence of God.  There is no absolute scientific evidence of either the existence or the non-existence of God.  Its all in what you choose to believe after examining the evidence.<br>
<br>
Now, onward to your question.<br>
<br>
I was raised Catholic - hated it, hated everything about it.  Thought of God as this being up there with a tally sheet marking down everytime I lied so that he could send me to hell.  Also, my Gram talked about the Devil **gasp** like he was real.  Freaked me out.  I mean yeah I wanted to believe in a God, but not a Devil who might want to hurt me.  Needless to say - turned away from the church quite early I did.<br>
<br>
Went to camp at 14, became a Christian there.  Why?  Because there was something missing in my life that no one could fill.  Not mom or dad, not other guys, not friends, not even myself.  I kept thinking to myself  &quot;this cannot be all there is.&quot;  I mean, whats the point of living I thought, if you just keel over in 50 years and get eaten by worms?  Also, I liked the fellowship there.  The acceptance.  The love.  I found myself wanting to be a part of that community.<br>
<br>
I was able to keep that for a couple years, then went to college, and lost the fellowship, which really, I lost my path too.  I had no fellowship, I didn't study the Bible.. my fiancee didn't believe in God even.<br>
<br>
Fast forward.  Serious personal issues arise in marraige.  Marraige almsot breaks down, I ask for a divorce.  My husband after 30 years of non-belief finds a chuch, becomes a Christain.  Took him almost two years, but I finally believed that he really had changed.  For him, it was because of his relationship with God.<br>
<br>
I started going to church again.  I renewed my realtionship with God, and now am &quot;walking&quot; with God as we call it, studying and developing.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say, God saved me years ago, God saved my marraige through my husband's prayer and patience and change, God has given me all that I cherish.<br>
<br>
That explains why God.  Its all experience and emotions, yeah.  My husband's decision was NOT on emotion, neither was a close friend's... theirs was based on research, which I helped with.  I also had questions.<br>
<br>
Now, why the Christian God out of all the religions/Gods currently out there?<br>
<br>
Jesus is the only one who offers forgiveness.  Thats the simple answer.<br>
<br>
I<br>
ll elaborate a teeny bit more now.<br>
<br>
I don't want to quote bible verses at you, but obviously, I believe in God, and in the fall, and in the need for forgiveness in order to be with God.  Without that forgiveness, I would be judged by God when I die.  I don't want to be judged, I know that I fall far short.  I'd be in Hell for sure!  Yeah, we all think the line where hell begins is always right below where we are, no matter what we are doing.  We don't think we need forgiveness.  But!  Jesus offers not only forgiveness, but bridges the gap between God and all humans that occurred with the fall.  God's nature is immutable.  He is love and patience, he is also just, judging, holy, and righteous.  I personally, do not want to be without God in this life or in eternity.  Jesus makes it so that I do not have to be.  His forgiveness clears me of all sin, always.  And let me tell you - what a damn relief that is!  <br>
<br>
No other God, no other religion offers this.<br>
<br>
Should I say that again?<br>
<br>
The Christian God is the only one that offers this free gift of forgiveness.  No hoops to jump through, no changes to make before doing it, no restictions. Just a decision and a small prayer, asking God to come into your heart.  Read rev 3 :20 (i think) Behold, I stand at the door and knock..    that one.  <br>
<br>
Judiasm and Islam are the other monotheistic religions.  Both believe Jesus was a prophet, neither believe he was the messiah, come to take away the sins of the world.  Judiasm is still waiting.  Neither offer a free gift of forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Most of the other major religions are pantheistic, polytheistic, or even animalistic.  Looking critically at all of the religions, Christianity (for me and for many) offers the best answers, the best solutions, and evidence I find compelling.  These other religions sometimes offered answers, but often they did not.  Not for sin, or evil, or suffering, or values, or love, or morals, or even existence itself.<br>
<br>
In addition, after asking God into my life and pursuing a relationship with Him, I have seen incredible changes.  Both in my life and in others.  <br>
<br>
There is so much more I could say, but I believe I answered your question.<br>
<br>
In summary, no other God, no other religion, offers freely a gift of forgiveness to all humankind that brings us into a relationship with God as it was meant to be.  <br>
<br>
I want the relationship, I want the forgiveness (that one time boon - Jesus has paid our Debt in Full for all time for us - for free, every sin I've ever committed or do commit or will commit).  <br>
<br>
It is the only religion that made sense to me.<br>
<br>
It says in the bible actually, that to the unbeliever, God's words will sound as foolishness.  It sounds too good to be true in many people's opinions, but it really is the truth.  I firmly believe that.  If you choose not to listen or believe, that is your absolute free choice.  I do believe it is an eternal choice though.<br>
<br>
Yeah, ok flame me for a God-loving bible thumper.  Proud to be so!<br>
<br>
Have a great day.<br>

Lukaria that is one of the lamest dumb ass statements of the century!! So, let me see. If I observe, study, and prove by experimentation that Buffy my lap dog sheds hairs I have squat! It is not reality that Buffy my lap dog shed hair? Lukaria you are a dumb shit!<br>
<br>
Now to brighten your day Lukaria! Science is truly the study of what is real and what is fact. You want to talk about "reality" then you better get a little more dryer behind your ears. I suggest you actually finish school Lukaria. It might even be good to drop EQ to read those books you might not be reading so you can game! Are you 15 Lukaria?

<br>
I would say, Triff, that forgiveness for my sins does not equal immorality, nor is there a relief of responsibility at all.  <br>
<br>
Lets discuss that further.<br>
<br>
A great place to read about this is Corinthians beginning in Chapter 5 (if you have access to a bible you can read this yourself, read through chapter 7).  This section is written by Paul, whom many probably know was a murderer.  He became a Christian and was forgiven his sins.  It is written to the Corinthians, who are believers and have been saved, but they are leading horridly immoral lives.  Paul tells them that though lawful to him, not all things are profitable.  He also tells them not to judge those outside of the faith, but we can judge those within the faith i.e. if someone is an immoral Christian and will not repent, and will not give up that which is immoral, he can be removed from the fellowship of the church. <br>
<br>
So, point one.  All things are lawful but not all things are profitable.<br>
<br>
Here is what is at the heart of your question.  When you accept Christ into your heart, you are &quot;born again&quot; so to speak into the Christian life.  Your sins are erased forever, as they have been paid by Christ himself .  In the bible, it says that those who have been born again no longer are &quot;under the law.&quot;  Now, basically what this means is that we no longer live under the yoke of making sacrifice/penance to God in order to atone for our sins.  i.e. when you sinned in the old testament, you made a sacrifice to God to atone for it (you killed a lamb or something ).  Jesus though is the ultimate sacrifice.  His sacrifice, of his own life for us, has paid the debt for all time. <br>
<br>
Not being under the law means that the old testament sins, for example, do not apply to us in relation to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> God’s view of us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  This means that’s though we need to obey God and live a moral life, we invariably will fall short and sin, but that will not be held against us.  It does not change our standing in God’s eyes if we are “saved.”  Not being under the law means that even though we sin, if we ask forgiveness, we shall not be held accountable for those sins on our day of judgment because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Jesus has already done that - he has taken all the sins upon Himself for us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  When we stand before God, our sins already will have been atoned for.  <br>
<br>
Does this mean that I could for example - have an affair?  Sure I suppose it could.  I would be forgiven for it, technically speaking - it would not bar my path to Heaven ultimately.  But I know that is wrong and is immoral.  Doing so would not only likely destroy much of my marriage (which is newly back together) and rip my family apart, but would also create huge feelings of guilt and self-hatred within me, and impede my spiritual growth.  This is NOT a profitable life to lead.  So though it might be lawful, it is not profitable.  In other words, Paul says, you'd be saved still if you did this, but you'd ruin your life - so why do it?<br>
<br>
This brings up the second point:  the Church could judge me.  If I had an affair and continued to have an affair and lead an immoral life, and I refused to repent after repeated attempts by the church to help me, the church could actually judge me and kick me out, thereby refusing me the fellowship of other Christians.  It is within their right to do so.  That doesn't mean the church will judge, but that they can judge, because I am a believer in Christ.  If I was not a believer, they would have no basis for judging me.<br>
<br>
Also consider the following points:<br>
<br>
God reads your heart.  Do you honestly think that God could not penetrate your heart and see if you are really sincere when asking him into your life?  If a murderer asks God into His heart, but with only an outward show of piety and an inward calculation (&quot;Gee, let me ask God into my heart and then I'll still go to heaven even though I've murdered 100 people), God WILL see that.  You must be sincere.<br>
<br>
Also consider this : once you sincerely ask God into your life, the Holy Spirit then becomes a guiding force in your life.  Yes, you can ignore it, but its very hard.  That is why so many people who honestly pursue relationships with God have so many wonderful changes in their lives.    <br>
<br>
This is not to say that we (Christians) never sin.  In fact, we do sin.  Just like everyone else on this earth, I am still a human with all that fallen nature implies (carnal and otherwise).  I still fall far short of perfection.  That’s why Christians should be the LAST people to judge others (non-believers), we know though, that often is not the case.  I feel that it is not my role to judge, that is God's role.  It is my job to become as much like Christ as I can, full of love and serving my fellow man, and spreading the good news.  <br>
<br>
That should answer your questions about moral responsibility, I hope.<br>
<br>
Now to the last part.  Why is forgiveness required.  Forgiveness is required in two different phases.  In this life, forgiveness is required in order to have a relationship with God.  God is a righteous being, and we cannot have contact with Him unless our sins are “made right” or atoned for.  In the next life, forgiveness of sins is required in order to dwell in heaven with God.  Again, He is a righteous and Holy being and will NOT allow evil into Heaven.  Your sins must be atoned for in order for you to be allowed in.  Sins, in God’s eyes are evil and a sinful person will not be allowed into contact with him or allowed to dwell in heaven with him.  Jesus, by being the ultimate sacrifice, atoned for ALL our sins for all time.  All you have to do is ask him into your heart and believe he did indeed die for your sins.  When God looks at me, Jesus stands there and takes all my sins onto Himself, so that God sees a righteous person.  <br>
<br>
Now, as to is this a big selling point.  You’d think it would be, wouldn’t you?  The thing is, when you talk like I have above most people think you’re crazy, that you are a religious fanatic, they see you as uncool, a weirdo, a freak.  First off, to them it sounds like mumbo jumbo, obviously you have to study the bible and really get into the word so that you can understand it.  The bible is not light reading.  Secondly, it sounds too good to be true.  They look at me and say “ you mean all I have to do is believe Jesus died for my sins, and sincerely ask God into my heart, and all my sins are forgiven?”  The answer is yep.  And it sounds too good for them.  Why would Jesus do that for them?  Where is the catch?  The answer is simple.  There is no catch.  Its free.  And God did it because He loves you, and wants you with Him.<br>
<br>
So, I hope I’ve done well.  I am sure I got a few things wrong here and there, but I certainly hope you were able to read and understand what I wrote.  Like I said,  a lot of people will think its total mumbo jumbo.<br>
<br>
If you have serious further questions regarding this, why don’t you email me? Lukaria@hotmail.com.  It is much easier to discuss over email than in a message board forum.  Its also easier for me to add links to pertinent information, and/or refer to someone more knowledgeable.<br>
<br>
I also must caution – I am by not means an expert.  I think I got all this correct.  Also, remember that many people, even Christians would disagree with me on a few points.  This is all simply my opinion from study and discussion.  A mature Christian of 20 years would probably be a better person to answer you.  In addition, I want to assure you I don’t intend to come across as arrogant or pompous or all-knowing or holier than thou.  If I do at all, it assuredly is an honest mistake and I apologize.  I simply find discussion of this quite intriguing and am delighted to be able share my love for God and the gospel.<br>
<br>
Have a terrific day.<br>
<br>
Luky<br>

Lukaria, the problem is not so much with your definition as it was with the &quot;logic&quot; you presented. You concluded:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;]&quot;Science does NOT = reality&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your conclusion doesn't even remotely follow from the dictionary definitions you provided. I think what you wanted to say was something more like &quot;Science involves many disciplines of study about the world and should not itself be taken to stand for reality.&quot; But, if that is what you meant the statement itself is not terribly informative. I think everyone could agree with that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Reference them, please. As for proving that it isn't all an illusion; I used to have a much better argument for this but I've forgotten it at the moment, but I can still say that if I just sat motionless, waiting for proof either way, I would die. I take in what I see around me and act accordingly. It's pretty self-evident and simple.<br>
<br>
You know, this is somewhat obvious, but I only just now realized and named this thought.. The reason it's inevidable that humans will &quot;sin&quot; is because your definition of sinning is not based on the actual nature of human beings, it's based on what The Master wants you to do. We weren't meant to be slaves. This is why it is difficult to follow something else's will—not because humans are evil, but because our nature is not defined by service.<br>
<br>
And Lurikeen, while this won't prove much to you, I think that you having a deep-seated hatred of religion (of anything) is good evidence that somewhere along your line of thinking, something is irrational. High-gushing anger is usually the result of that. When you've rationally thought out your view of life, anger isn't what you feel so much as just plain indifference. But hey, also, since they 'have no choice otherwise,' how can you hate them for it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/2/01 12:08:18 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://server2048.virtualave.net/neplusultra/images/Links/Necromancer_Links/necrobackground.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to the Last Three Posts</span><hr size=1> [quote]"And Lurikeen, while this won't prove much to you, I think that you having a deep-seated hatred of religion (of anything) is good evidence that somewhere along your line of thinking, something is irrational.

<br>
Nice jab, Triff! :)  The fact of the matter is I do not hate religions at all. In fact, I have just had a family member of mine convert to Christianity and he gave me a call on the phone to tell me how wonderful it is. What did I do? I congratulated him on his new found joy. What I HATE, Triff, is the ARROGANCE of many Evangelical Christians. I have as yet to dish out the same treatment to Brutas as to what I have given to Lukaria (which I will no longer be "dishing out" period!). Brutas doesn't come off with the idea that all us poor "sinners" are in need of his brand of salvation. Sure he would be happy if all were god fearing believers such as himself, but he doesn't solicit his beliefs. I have a tremendous amount of respect for that. Evangelical Christians use their beliefs like a whore on the street corner to bring people in contact with "the Lord Jesus". I absolutely despise such behaviors.<br>
<br>
BTW, I have "rationally" thought out my life, and have found that there is no amount of rational thinking that can discount emotional content. While I am a rational agent I am also a very passionate one at that. :) Triff, there is nothing wrong with passion. Telling someone to fuck off a die will certainly not be beneficail, will make the recipient of the verbal abuse hate you most likely, but is a genuine expression of self. Indeed, I have met so many "rationalists" like myself who have found that reason can only go so far and then we must fall upon emotional content to complete ourselves. Atheists and Christians alike laugh aloud when I tell them I am a man of "faith". When I run out of reasonable answers to my questions I have to sometimes haul off and simply believe something to be the case. ;) I hope I have answered your questions. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
God exists weather or not you choose to believe.<br>
<br>
Just as the air you breath is there, so is God...<br>
<br>
It's pointless to argue with people such as those arguing against the existence of God... You could prove to them that the sky is blue and they would say, prove to me that what you see as blue is the same as what I say is blue- then go off on some tangent about what really IS blue anyway??? Is anything ever really Blue or is it actually every color other than blue and reflecting the blue so thats what our eyes see???<br>
<br>
 It's pointless... like I said. I'm not going to try and convince you that God exists- I don't have to do that and neither does God. <br>
Why should the creator of the universe have to prove anything to you?<br>
Does a painter or sculptor have to prove to his creation that the signature at the bottom is actually his- only to have that painting or sculpture deny that there even is a signature? Obsurd!<br>
<br>
God exists weather you believe it or not and no amount of debate over this fact is going to change anyones mind one way or the other.<br>
<br>
Oh and Jesus DID exist, it's historical fact documented and described in roman text recovered from that era. His existance is not debatable... What is argued though, Was he the Mesiah? That friends, is anoher thread of discussion- this one however began as &quot;Do you believe in God.&quot;<br>

I do see your point although I am not atempting to prove God's existence.  I AM however explaining my thoughts, feelings and opinions of God's existence.  I know he is there.  I enjoy debate.  Its exercise for the mind.  Builds character too.  I enjoy pondering others thoughts and feelings as it makes me a better person.  No matter how strange or different someone's thoughts and feelings are, they have some truth to them.  Yep, everyone does.  Even the guy who went on a rampage in Indiana.  Was he right for what he did?  Hell the fuck no.  Would I have put a bullet in his ass if I was there?  Yea, would have bullet-blown his nuts right off.  BUT, he was angry for a reason.  Something bad happened to him.  Happy people don't freak out like that.  People that are hurt do.  And when they are hurt and no one recognizes their pain, they do crazy ass shit.  DAMN, that was waaayyyy off the topic.  Shit I'm sorry.<br>
  Not comparing Lurikeen or Triff or Xamael(haven't seen him in a while) with that guy, but everyone who has a different opinion has a reason for it.  <br>
  Anyway, Lurikeen(mainly only him) has recognized my opinions and I have recognized his.  At first we were flaming the hell out of each other.  Now, I consider him a friend because of his recognition.  And we have actually found out that we have much in common.  In fact more in common than any other person I have spoken to about such a massive topic.  I believe its important to communicate with love and truth.  This is the way God communicates with me and tihs is the way I prefer communicating.  Interesting thing is, Lurikeen and probably Triff and Xamael do also.  Not sure if you have noticed, but they said they are atheist.  It doesn't matter if people believe in God.  Everyone will know.  God loves atheists too.  He loves their thoughts and feelings.  Their drive and passion for understanding the world around them.  God loves them.  Does the person who is retarded not believe in God Dunkk?  Or does it only take growing up in a Christian household to become CHristian?  or does it take a conceptual part of the brain to believe in God?  Neither I say.  Its about love and truth.  These people speak of love and truth and they are Christian to me.  They have a relationship with God just as much as you and me.  Your heartless and cold opinion of them is the truthless and loveless communication they dispise.  And calling yourself a CHristian is not a category they want to belong to because of the way you communicated.  You are frustrated, but everyone is frustrated with something.

<br>
I don't know what happens to the 2 year old baby when it dies, I don't know about the retarded person, and I don't know about life after death for the remote cannables in outer mongolia...<br>
<br>
I do know that there is a God and that the world around me has too many complex systems that could not exist unless they were created at the same time, but I digress.<br>
<br>
My arguement (since we are all partaking of this friendly debate) is that God Does Exist and that it would be easier to argue that the sky is/ is not blue to a blind person than to try and prove to someone that God Exists.<br>
<br>
Weather or not a blind person does or does not believe that the sky is blue (or perhaps does not have any idea what &quot;blue&quot; is) does nothing to change the fact that the sky IS actually blue.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is that I'm not going to try to prove it by arguing a case- Im just going to be content knowing that I'm not blind and that the sky really is blue.<br>
:-)<br>
<br>
One more thing...<br>
Have you ever stared into one of those &quot;Magic Eye&quot; posters? These posters look like trippy drug induced finger paintings but if you stare into them long enough a 3D image appears from all the squiggels on the page... (a flock of birds in flight, dolphins, airplanes, boats... etc.) <br>
Anyhow, most people can see the 3D images but some just can't... no matter how hard they try or how many times you tell them &quot;look, it's right there!&quot;<br>
 <br>
It does no good to deny the existance of God... Just as the painting DOES have a 3d image in it, weather or not you believe that the image is there (or that God exists) changes nothing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ubrutas222.showPublicProfile?language=EN>brutas222</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/7/01 4:41:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to Dunkk</span><hr size=1>   Hey Dunkk.  I see what you mean about the poster and agree to a certain extent.  I know their are some people who have a more deistic approach to their belief in God.  (not saying you are)  But I however, believe that God makes a presence amongst us.  Or miracles if you want to call it that.  So I feel that its not futile to express my thoughts feelings ect.. to someone who disagrees.  Like I was saying before, I have learned since speaking to Lurikeen and respect his ideals.  At first we butted heads, then, the more we expressed our ideals, the more we realized we had the same ideals.  I believe that CHristianity has a bad stigma to many people and can understand why. This stigma is a huge barrier for most people.  This, again is my opinion and I am not trying to convert or influence other people who say they don't believe.  This is where I agree with you when you said some people just dont see it.  But, on the other side of the token I believe time is relative and it makes no difference whether someone doesnt believe it at this point in time.  Its all a journey <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Many people who say they believe have very little foundation for those beliefs and are not any closer to God than an athiest.  In fact, I think its probable that they are further away from him.  I believe atheists are in the 'belief' process just like a so-called 'Christian'; the only thing that makes them different is that they are at a different level.  I believe they are at a higher level than others.  Some people are inductive learners and some are deductive.  The advantage atheists have over us is that they will have a stronger foundation than most Christians.  Not necassarily because they have learned to live without God, but because they will appreciate God more when they DO believe and because they have been searching truth and love all the while.  I know this because I wasn't sure about Jesus.  Until I learned mroe about what he was all about.  When I accepted him as my savior I felt a very strong presence(not saying this should happen to everyone, but its what happened to me).   This recognition of God(IMO), can be compared to a flood of spirit whereas the casual Christian will have a constant flow in their growth with God.  Two different process'.  One is not 'better' than the other; just different.  FOR ME, when I found out that God sent his son to live as a mortal, he was assuring us that he too knows how it feels to be 'us'.  THAT is why I accepted Jesus.  I didn't know about this.  I just thought God sent his son to let us know that he was king and shit and that he loved us.  But knowing how it feels to be me; knowing what my pain is and accepting me with my faults makes Jesus one Kick-ass friend.  I didn't accept him because someone told me to; I accepted him because I searched for him and I found him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/7/01 5:06:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://64.81.30.48/EQstuff/luri.bmp height=113 width=105></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Response to the Last Three Posts</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Why should the creator of the universe have to prove anything to you?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hmmm... how about for the sake of love for his creation? Or, just maybe god is a social being? I can think of many reasons why a god would want to clearly demonstrate its existence. You seem to be saying that being a &quot;creator&quot; absolves god of all and any responsibility to its creation. So, I suppose, in your view, god could arbitrarily nuke millions of people at will? And, that would be OK because he is the &quot;creator&quot;, right?<br>

You say it is, but can you demonstrate why? What makes that absurd. Oh, yes, you provided the example of the sculpture. Well, Dunkk, a sculptor will leave his signature on his work precisely to prove that he alone is the creator of the work! Sort of discounts what you are trying to claim. Why does an artist leave a signature or signature marks at all? Go figure.<br>

Really? That is news to me. What contemporary Roman texts refer to Jesus? BTW, if you are going to quote the piece from Flavius Josephus there are two problems you will need to overcome: 1) Josephus is not contemporary to Jesus; 2) most biblical scholars agree that the piece is a forgery.

<br>
I am going to make a remark here Dunkk, so don't take this too personally. Such remarks (as yours above) is flagrantly arrogant. Many, many, Christians do not even see how they come across to others when talking about the existence of god or when they talk about their church's teachings.<br>
<br>
You know Dunkk, you have no idea who I am and I certainly do not know you. But why would you even attempt to imply that non-believers in your god are incapable of hearing your case, or for that matter are &quot;blind&quot;? It is utter bull shit! One thing I respect about Brutas the most is that he is very humble about his belief in a deity. He mentioned that we flamed back and forth, but not once did he EVER attempt to belittle me, Triff, or others for our non-belief in his god. I am not going to go much further here.... What I do want to say, Dunkk, is that it is not &quot;pointless&quot; to argue over what you believe is &quot;truth&quot;. It is actually &quot;pointless&quot; not to argue about it. If you are incapable of holding an argument it may show that you have not searched your feelings deep enough to express them in the slightest. I will leave it here. /shrugs<br>

Historical References to Jesus, His Miracles and His Resurrection, Outside the New Testament<br>
<br>
The following is a brief excerpt from a larger book.<br>
For a fuller treatment of this subject as well as a better context, see:<br>
I’d Like To Believe In Jesus, But…<br>
(The harder, less frequently discussed questions)<br>
By Bob Siegel<br>

<br>
Many good books have been written on the accuracy of the Bible, and for that reason, I will move on now and spend some time talking about the witness of Jesus outside of the New Testament, because that witness also is abundant. <br>
<br>
We’ll begin with the Jewish witness. Although the original church was made up primarily of Jews, most of the nation of Israel rejected Jesus as the promised Messiah, and the Jewish priests and teachers were particularly hostile to Him. In the Talmud (an ancient rabbinic storehouse of law, wisdom and commentary) Jesus is described as both a sorcerer and an apostate. <br>
<br>
On the eve of the Passover <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Yeshu</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, ‘He is going to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to Apostasy. Anyone who can say anything in his favor, let him come forward and plead on his behalf. But since nothing was brought forward in his favor, he was hanged on the eve of the Passover (Sanhedrin 43A, Babylonian Talmud from Tannaaitic period 70-200 Ad. Translation from Jacob Shachter, Sanhedrin, Translated into English With Notes, Glossary And Indices, Chapters 1-6 by Jacob Schachter, Chapters 7-11 by H. Freedman, London, 1948: Soncino, p.281-2). <br>
<br>
1. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Yeshu, of course, is the Hebrew word for Jesus.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;Hanging&quot; was another way of describing a crucifixion.<br>
<br>
2 Apostates were people who broke from the faith and/or preached heresy. Jesus’ divine claims certainly placed Him into this category. The idea of a mere man claiming to be the God of Israel was as outrageous and dangerous as false teaching could possibly be. (Unless, of course, Jesus was telling the truth). But the Sanhedrin (a Jewish puppet court, allowed by the Romans to have limited jurisdiction over internal affairs) did not believe His claim and had no recourse but to denounce Him as a traitor and blasphemer.<br>
<br>
Now here’s the big question: Why did the Talmud go on to conclude that Jesus was also a sorcerer? Because, in those days, if you didn’t like a religious personality but could not deny the fact that He was doing miracles, the only recourse was to call Him a sorcerer, or tool of the devil. Although most Jews today will insist that they do not believe in Satan, Jews in Jesus’ day did. He was mentioned in the Holy Scriptures (Job 1, 2), and He was viewed as a rebellious spirit who sought to deceive people by performing miracles, as exemplified by the magicians of Pharaoh’s court who imitated the miracles of Moses (Exodus 7, Kiddushin 49<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , Babylonian Talmud).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What we have then, is a fantastic anti-Christian source with bias pre-disposed against Jesus, a source nevertheless affirming that a teacher named Jesus came to Palestine with incredible claims and an ability to perform miracles.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
...There are more sources recording the activities, teachings, and &quot;hanging&quot; of Jesus. Just as the Movie Ben Hur illustrates there were hundreds, even thousands of witnesses to his miracles, &quot;trial&quot; and crucification. (Im not using the movie as a resource... just an example to show that there were others that saw Jesus and wrote down their thoughts about him and his teachings.)<br>

&quot;We now come to the issue of mention of Jesus in the Jewish Talmud. Here McDowell's lack of scholarship is again painfully evident. In fact, we are again tempted to say that because the correct information is so readily available, perhaps his failure to provide it is a deliberate attempt to mislead. We must first explain that the present Talmud contains virtually no mention of Jesus. This is because there was much persecution of the Jews during the Middle Ages, and many Jews were afraid that the presence of the numerous unfavorable references to Jesus which existed in the Talmud of the time would bring down the additional wrath of the Christians. These references were gradually eliminated, by agreement, during the many subsequent recopyings of the Talmud which occurred over the years. However, most of these references to Jesus have not been lost to our view, since they have been collected by scholars from ancient copies of the Talmud and republished several times. Of course, McDowell is blissfully unaware of all of this. If we look at the materials con-cerning Jesus which had been removed from the later copies of the Talmud, we can see that they say that he was a bastard and a magician who learned magic spells in Egypt or else stole the secret name of God from the temple and used it to work magic or miracles. The father of Jesus is also claimed to be a soldier named Pantera. At any rate, authorities are agreed that most of this Talmudic material derives from the period from 200 to 500 A.D., and represents Jewish attempts to deal with the growing strength of Christianity. It makes no attempt to be historically accurate and, in fact, is of no use in determining if Jesus was an historical person. McDowell, of course, mentions none of this, and is also in error (or purposely misleads) when he says that &quot;Comments in the Baraila are of great historical value:&quot; and then gives a quote which leaves off the initial few words, namely &quot;And it is tradition ...&quot;. This means that the Talmudic scribe was merely reporting what had been said by Christians (and this is in about 300 A.D.). The passage describes how Jesus was stoned and hanged for practicing magic. That doesn't quite sound like the New Testament account.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;When you add up all of the following facts, the case for the existence of Jesus as an historical person becomes rather remote: 1) there are no proven, legitimate references to the existence of Jesus in any contemporary source outside of the New Testament (which is really not a contemporary source, as it was written from 30 to 70 years after Jesus supposedly died), 2) There is no evidence that the town of Nazareth, from which Jesus' mother supposedly came, ever existed at the time he was supposedly living there, 3) the existence of Jesus is not necessary to explain the origin or growth of Christianity (were the Hindu gods real'?), 4) the New Testament accounts do not provide a real &quot;biography&quot; for Jesus until you look at the Gospels. The earlier Pauline epistles imply only that he was a god, and 5) the biblical accounts of the trial and death of Jesus are logically self-contradictory and legally impossible. Jesus could not have been executed under either Roman or Jewish law for what he did. Whatever you call what he did, it was not a capital offense under either system. Rather, it looks like someone is trying to make Old Testament prophecies of the death of the Messiah come true by fabricating a scenario which simply doesn't make sense legally.&quot;<br>

<br>
I mentioned in previous statments- It is futile to attempt to prove the existance of God through arguements... Tell someone that God did X or Y and they will say prove it and prove everything about that, then prove that all that ever existed. The bible talks about those that will always be blind...<br>
<br>
I could site other documents and you would continue to argue against those as well. No matter how much documented proof be presented before you- you will never accept them or be dissuaded- and for this I will no doubt sound like an arrogant ass.<br>
<br>
Even if I attempt to strictly use logic or if I continue to site outside anti-christian refrences you would proceed in doing your best to discredit the documents and the logic. <br>
<br>
No amount of arguing the existance of God or attempting to somehow prove to you that Jesus existed will ever be fruitful.<br>
<br>
The &quot;futile to argue&quot; thing I began with before comes from having this argument many times before and realizing that people are never &quot;won&quot; over to believing in God. No amount of debate is ever going to help with this subject. For every resource I can name you will undoubtedly furnish a counter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The spirituality and Belief in God that I have is not something that I or anyone can ever argue into you.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If I say: &quot;This document is valid because...&quot;, you simply counter with: &quot;No, it's not because...&quot; and then we are back to square one... thus it is futile.<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it friends, we are simply going to have to agree to disagree.<br>
<br>
I will leave this thread by saying that,<br>
<br>
I believe that there is a God because believing in the Chaos of evolution and submitting to the hopelessness of NO afterlife is just too horribly depressing for me to go on living. (I really mean that)<br>
<br>
What is this whole existance of ours worth if we are only here to work, propagate, grow old and fade away to dust? Should I be ok with being insignificant? Should I be contented to go on living knowing that nothing I do matters and the only reason we are here is because of some goo or ooze from billions of years ago? <br>
<br>
If I sound arrogant in my belief in God it's because I HAVE to believe- otherwise I question my very existance and the hopelessness is just too much for me.<br>
 <br>
I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> choose</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to believe in the evidence put before me which offers me hope, love and a prospect of a Heaven- and I need those things just as I need my very next breath.<br>
Argue that all you want.<br>
<br>
IMO- When it comes down to it- My belief in God and his son Jesus gives me hope. I respectfully won't tell you what your not believing in God gives you as I really have no idea.  I will continue to cling to my hope- I need it.<br>
<br>
Best wishes to you all and my highest regard and respect to you for your comments, they were very well thought out and elegantly presented.<br>

Dunkk, I very much respect the above statement. I have no desire to &quot;deconvert&quot; believers and I certainly feel that if religion helps people and is not destructive to others then nobody has any business trying to take that away.<br>
<br>
I applaud your honesty, Dunkk. Be well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
