A Few days ago i was auctioning my tantors tusk and ghalewind was offering me some stuff then asked to borrow it. i said alright if u give me 35k in items to hold so we exchanged he used it then he traded back. a little later after some trading he wanted to try it in a duel and i let him use it and keep the items. cuz ive known him for a while and never herd anything bad about him. then he was dueling. he lost and kept taunting the guy to finish him off. and finally he did then after he died he went LD. /q is my guess then when i got back on i herd he sold it to my friend for 2 lamentations and some other gear.. ghalewind was back on i talked to him he claims it was his friend on the account and that he would pay me back the 35k in items. i asked if he had the lamentations and other gear and he said it was gone... <br>
 <br>
i dont know if he is saying the truth or what but that was my last 35k. i had like 10-15k total after that. so if he doesnt hand it back im going to another server.<br>

There are alot of people that will not give you alot of sympathy when you say things like this.  The majority of people have and will never see thier *FIRST* 35k.<br>
<br>
I agree that the situation sucks, but most people would be pretty happy to have 10-15k *LEFT* in the bank. <p>Garoan Swiftbolt<Br>

Anyway we were grouped with Skirla (possibly Skrila) and Ghalewind comes in wanting in....huge zone wide shouting match ensues.....seems Skrila won a random on a second FBSS earlier while grouped with Ghalewind. She still had the first and couldn't loot it.....asked Ghalewind to loot it and she would give him 2k as a holding fee. While I personally believe in NBG if the group let her random it was her item. Ghalewind got the FBSS and after Skrila left evidently the group decided it should go to Ghalewind who had second highest roll. When Skrila tried to claim the FBSS he refused to hand it over. Honestly I think the whole situation was FUBAR but it shows considerable greed on both parts and if not outright dishonesty then a willingness to put themselves in a dishonorable light and I personally don't want to ever group with either.  <p><img src = members.aol.com:/dotseqname/leldari></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uparum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Parum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/13/01 12:20:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghalewind</span><hr size=1> Ghalewind won an FBSS while I was doing some safe experiencing (FU KC!).

Crom also has this guy on ignore, hehe.  He *tried* to get into one of our dragon raids.<br>

Oh yeah, anyone remember Lextor from back in the day?  He said that he is Lextor, &quot;everyone likes Ghalewind because he isnt the same as he was playing Lextor&quot;... riiiight.<br>

Then he said this is Ghalewind, which I proceeded to tell him that I don't know Ghalewind either. He claimed he didn't have any money left after twinking the caster, so I politely told him its not my problem.<br>
<br>
But you're pretty well off the topic about that FBSS comment. LGuk is random for all zone and I don't see why melee's who have always randomed against ALL in group to get an item, would be any different situation after all when they don't themselves need it.<br>

The open loot rules there are pretty much polarized from what you will find in *most* Kunark and Velious higher end dungeons.<br>
<br>
As much as I hate to go into KC, I do sometimes still stroll in for exp..and one of the funniest things to watch is the NOOb's that have come straight out of Lguk when the first decent drops occurs.  These guys have no concept of NBG..and they whine and cry when they are told..&quot;no..RandomNoob_01 you can't random on the Donal's cause our cleric doesn't have them&quot; .  Hehe they pitch a fit then start claiming fraud and scam..LOL.  Funny thing is..its not a week later that you see these same asses in a group saying things like &quot;Ok..if any *insert kunark/velious* armor drops for my class its mine cause we do NGB right?&quot;  Too funny!<br>
<br>
I've have always been a huge proponent of NBG.  Its truly the only way to go..and in Kunark and Velious you will find it to be house rules in most all end game dungeons.  If a piece drops and there is no class in the group..then fine..wide open random it..but if there is a warrior..or mage..or rogue in group..and a piece drops for them..and some gimp starts shouting that he wants in on the random he will very promptly find himself disbanded if I'm running the group..or they will be without a puller if I'm not.  Kunark and Velious were created so we could get away from the pharms of Lguk and finally enjoy the game again..not just sit around and watch as a necro or wizzie walks out of a group with a FBSS or a Shadow Knight trots away with a SMR..while some other poor ass whose been there for 10 hours and truly needs it gets nada.<br>
<br>
And don't feed many any bullshit about &quot;Well, I was there and helped kill it so I'm just as entitled to it as he was! WAAA&quot;<br>
You know what?  You are replaceable.  You are expendable..so am I.  You wanna bitch that you can't sell UBERLOOT_02 for phat plat?  Fine..go whine about it to someone who cares..or go pharm Runnyeye.  I will have you replaced in minutes with someone eager to be there not for PHAt LEwTZ..but rather for the love of the game.<br>
<br>
Wanna kick me out of group cause I don't like your loot policy..please do..I was a dumbass for not asking about it earlier cause if I had known you weren't gonna give X loot to X class, but rather roll on it and sell it back to him..then I wouldn't have been grouped with you in the first place.<br>
<br>
SHEESE..someone medicate me I'm foaming at the mouth GRAWWWWHH..<br>
<br>
God I hate gimps...If Lguk fell into a ocean of shit tomorrow and never surfaced again I would dance naked in Grobb with my epic hanging out of my ass I would be so happy.<br>

I'm a thoroughly agnostic person with a sound believe in a higher power. One thing I do believe in is the wrong you do will come back to bite you in the ass. I see on the other thread you are trying to pay ppl back.....good because at least you won't have those wrongs to answer for someday. <p><img src = members.aol.com:/dotseqname/leldari></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ghalewind>Ghalewind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/22/01 5:32:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghalewind</span><hr size=1> (This message was left blank) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ghalewind>Ghalewind</A> at: 7/24/01 11:03:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uspycewrack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spyce Wrack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/23/01 5:00:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ghalewind</span><hr size=1> If you're going to call someone a 'dumb moron' its probably best to check your posts for spelling errors. <br>
<br>
Not that a typo by itself is a sign of stupidity, but added to your other post that included the racist Jewish comment, I'm thinking you're a fair way to the left on the intelligence bell curve.<br>
<br>
And please don't point out my grammatical/spelling errors. I'm sure they exist :P<br>
