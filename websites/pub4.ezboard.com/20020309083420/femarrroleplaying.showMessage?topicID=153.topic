She slowly attempts to move away from a brown skeleton that taunts her with laughter while slashing her with a rusty broad sword every step she takes. Each slash of the rusty sword exposes her innards to the brown Skeleton. Behind her, fingers of lightning illuminate the form of a Dark Elf Necromancer hidden in the shadows, casting spells that slowly drain the Human Monk of her precious life. The Necromancer quickly snaps his arms back releasing another charge of life draining energy at the Monk. The spell’s force drives her down to the cold wet ground leaving her with a thread of life. Gasping for air she watches as the Necromancer emerges from his hiding place, his blue skin paled from the practice of his art, he glowers at her as he gaits towards her. Standing above her, the Necromancer emits a low rumble then growls calling off his skeletal pet that reluctantly ends its attack. The Necromancer dryly cackles then rhetorically asks the Monk, " I see we have become quit intimate these past few moments have we not? Only now do you understand the power of Hate, Monk." Gasping for air the Monk writhes in pain. Taunting her the Necromancer asks, "Is that the best you can do? I see that good has run its course for you!" He continues, "Nevertheless, you shall die very soon, but before you had gone home to your god I wanted you to see who sucked away your precious life energy. I am Lurikeen Mali`Kyre, Son of Innoruuk and keeper of Hate. From when we first met minutes ago... <cackles> excuse my ill manners. You first met my dear pet Jobaner.  Only after the battle began did you see me standing amongst the trees.  I must congratulate you the battle was exquisite!  You nearly had time to turn and chase after me until you were engulfed in darkness. Oh, you did continue your feeble little effort to reach me, but I cast my curse on you which slowly transferred your precious life to me as my pet opened your body up with his sword!"  Panting, the monk pulled at the blood soaked ground shrinking back from Lurikeen in an effort to put as much distance between her and the Necromancer. "So you still resist my embrace!” cackled Lurikeen. And then, with a single command from Lurikeen, Jobaner pulled his rusty blade through the air cleaving the monk’s head into two pieces. Lurikeen crouched over the corpse, removing items essential for his trade. <br> <br>Carefully, Lurikeen put his bounty into worn leather bags and then sat upon a large granite stone. Extracting a bottle of Brandy out of a leather pack Lurikeen uncorked it and took a large swig. The warmth of the alcohol penetrated the chill of his pale tired body. Lulled by the mixture of alcohol and pulled by his strong love for the dead, Lurikeen speaks to the corpse lying at the foot of the stone he sits upon. "Lovely Monk, I shall now teach you what it means to be a Necromancer, but before I do let me tell you the story of my beginning." He takes another swig of brandy and longingly stares into the bottle held in his hands. "I was once an agnostic Dark Elf. I conducted my business through out Norrath with little thought of my place in the world. I was a simple trader of goods I fashioned from silk and leather, being a tailor was my world, but I was not a master of the trade. Others came along with superior tailoring skills and my business waned. Soon I hadn’t a copper to my name and had to hunt for my food. Occasionally, I would kill something of value and loot the precious goods off of my victims. Life was not easy for me and I had very little patience outside of the hunt. I needed to have food in order to live. I needed order in my thinking so that I could hunt and make sense of my plight. One evening while hunting deep in the dark woods of Nektoulus I came upon a Young Kodiak. You should have seen me Monk! I, a determined young inexperienced Dark Elf ‘hunter’ faced by a hungry vicious Young Kodiak. Sure it didn’t help me that I nearly fell upon the beast and thusly startling it! It took two… maybe three swipes at me with massive paws. The razor sharp claws glistened with my blood as they ripped through my torso. I feel to the ground. I could not move as the young Bear dug its claws into my back and crushed my ribs with its weight! Oh, yes Monk, I was dead… or on my way to being very dead! The Young Kodiak moved on, I thought it would have eaten me, but it did not. I could feel my blood soak the ground under me. I lay on the forest floor for what seemed an eternity and then I felt something poking me. I moaned. Someone spoke over me in Dark Elvish and while I can’t remember the words spoken over me I do know that I nodded my head with what little life I had left in me. Suddenly a bright light illuminated my body and I found myself standing upright in a coffin! Had I died? What happened to me? In front of me was a Dark Elf who only identified himself as a member of the family “Mali`Kyre”. He was clad in an inky black robe and in his right hand he loosely gripped a Crystal Grinder. In his left hand he carried the Stein of Maggok that glows with eternal energy and provides us with insight into the wonders of Norrath. He spoke with thunderous words of my resurrection from the dead and that I had the god Innoruuk to thank for his power. Indeed, there were only scars from my battle with the Young Kodiak. I was completely whole! I was fascinated with the Dark Elf who resurrected me and asked his name. He held out to me a robe called ‘The Robe of Enshroudment”. I quickly put the robe on. Again, silently, he handed me a scroll. I unraveled the scroll and began to read its words aloud. Monk, you would have been fascinated with its contents. It contained references to worlds and powers I have as yet to discover! Excited, I wished to thank the Dark Elf responsible for my new being and looked up from the scroll only to find that he had gone. I carry his family’s name on through my surname in honor to his heroic deed. After closer examination of the scroll it revealed that I should seek out the Necromancer Guild leader in the beautiful city of Neriak. I traveled for days to find the guild leader and handed him the scroll. He welcomed me into an art I practice heartily to this day. It is the art of Necromancy. The art has always fit my nature. I hate those who have more than I do and don’t mind taking from them what is rightfully mine. My only loyalties are to the god who brought me life Innoruuk, and my dark brothers and sisters.” Using his Crystal Grinder Lurikeen pierced open the chest of the dead Monk. Gleefully he removed her internal organs and placed them into a leather sack reserved for his trophies. He wiped the Monk’s blood off of his hands in her hair and brushed the dirt off his robe. He then commanded his pet Jobaner to follow him and disappeared into the dark forest.<br> <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>Necromancer Lvl 23 <BR><BR>Who the fuck are you?!</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=153.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=153.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=153.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=153.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=153.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="emarrmessageboardrules">Message Board Rules<option value="emarrlinks">Links<option value="emarrupcomingmmorpgs">Upcoming MMOG's<option value="emarrfrm16">The Emarr Quadrant<option value="emarrfrm18">America Under Attack<option value="emarrfrm19">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="emarrgeneral">General<option value="emarrfrm17">Funny Stuff<option value="emarrbazaar">Item Bazaar<option value="emarrscrollsnspells">Spell Bazaar<option value="emarrfrm15">Shiny Things<option value="emarrfrm14">Bargain Basement<option value="emarrdragonsandplanes">Rants and Flames<option value="emarrfrm13">Dragons and Planes<option value="emarrroleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="emarrroleplayingoocforum">Roleplaying - OOC Forum<option value="emarrscammeralert">Scammer Alert<option value="emarrsignaturecorner">Test Forum<option value="emarrreallife">Real Life<option value="emarrothermmorpgs">Other MMOG's</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrroleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font><br><br> <br><br><center><font face="Verdana" size="2">Entertaining the Erollisi Marr community since 12/16/99!</font></center><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
