And although I heartily agree that Alnaron is an asshole, and that what he did was shitty, I still hold to the opinion that the moderators are using a double standard here and that much more significant posts have been taken down.<br>

<br>
It was taken down. /shrug.<br>
<br>
This is not just one incident. If this was about someone who had never been on the shit list, or that other people had not had problems with, then I would agree that while a shitty thing to do, it would not necessary belong on the shit list. However, more then a few people posted Alnaron previously, and more then a few people have had problems with him in the past. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think that people are able to make up their own minds anyway. This forum provides information, usually and hopefully from both parties involved in a conflict. It is hardly divine writ. There are often many sides or perspectives to any conflict someone has with someone else in game. At that point people can decide whether or not they want to avoid someone in EverQuest who they feel is a grief player, or whether or not the information has *any* bearing on their interaction with that person if it even comes up.<br>
<br>
Personally I liked the original rules. If a post was found to have merit AND more then one person had had a negative experience with that party, then it remained. After all, if someone changes then the post gets bumped to the back and eventually off the boards. If not, then the post remains to be resurrected and added to, and people had more information to make whatever decision they wanted to.  <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

It diverts the topic a little so I will post my thoughts on that first.  I dont think Alnaron was in the right.  He messed up and unless I read it wrong he did apologize for it a couple pages back.  In regards to his past character I think he is -much- improved upon himself since the neverending &quot;Alnaron and the fear raid&quot; shit list post.  Perhaps some people who have other issues with him are making this worse then it really is because they dont like him.  I dont really know but that is how I see it.  /shrug<br>
<br>
As to the point I really want to make I read a post made by Cicely waaaay back on page2.  It went something like this <br>
<br>
&quot;thankfully, alnaron has proven time and time again that he is part of the immature, whiny, childish antics of the 13-18 year old crowd on this server.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok im sorry Cicely but that line is utter BS.  I bring this up totally aside from any past disagreements we have had personnaly.  The fact is I truly hate those kinds of statements.  This is no different then saying all old people are slow, dull, and grouchy.  Neither statement is true.  I know just as many adults that display what you call &quot;13-18 year old crowd&quot; antics more then the 13-18 year old crowd.    <br>
<br>
Sorry all for the slight off topic but I had to point that out.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uhsianlichen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hsian Li Chen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><FONT COLOR=AA0000><B>Lanys.com Moderator</B></FONT></span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/10/01 10:50:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ya</span><hr size=1> back in those days any 'removing' of posts we did was just deleted, so we can't restore them =( now any post we delete gets moved to a backup folder... here what we would have done is pulled back al's old shitlist for all to see.<br>
<br>
the crux of the issue is that we were told that Alnaron has changed. Many people supported that, many people showed he didn't belong here.  Some people wanted him up there forever.<br>
<br>
now, we have a wonderful task.  Alnaron's actions in the arena are certainly nothing that would stick for a first offense, but this isn't a first offense.  Alnaron was -very- shitlisted previously, all valid shitlist posts.  We as moderators feel we were used in taking down his original shitlist, and i'm personally angry that alnaron would again revert to his selfish and careless behavior.<br>
<br>
i look at it like this:<br>
guy gets busted for cocaine possession + distribution twice. only his 2nd strike, so they let him rehab, do the whole 6 months then parole, and boom he's a normal citizen again.<br>
<br>
then a few months later, he's caught with an ounce of marijuana on him... normally that would be a slap on the wrist... but here, we have a pattern.  we have a history.  and our sentence would therefore be more severe.<br>
<br>
Alnaron's actions showed that he:<br>
a) actively decided to ruin another person's RP event<br>
b) is very proud that he did so<br>
c) shows no remorse for doing so <br>
d) is someone to still be avoided.<br>
<br>
point D i'm sure DT would disagree with, but talk to jolted, or any of the other people he's offended over his playing career.  he's someone to be at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  least</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wary about.  hence, he's here to stay.<br>

my comments on page two did not mean to infer that i think ALL 13-18 year olds on the server are whiny, immature people.  there is, however, a portion of the 13-18 year old player base on our server that IS whiny, immature people and that alnaron has proven once again that he holds a special place in that sect.  there is also a portion of our server that is 13-18, smart, respectful, intelligent.  there is a portion of our server that is 18-29, rude, crass, not caring bout others, and all around jerks.  there is a portion of our server that is 40+, kind, humble, sociable... <br>
<br>
i think we get the idea now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
point is that i was not generalizing all 13-18 year olds into one category that is degrading and insulting.  however, you cannot deny that there are 13-18 year olds who are simply rude, inconsiderate, immature people on this server... and alnaron is one of well known individuals who fit into this sector.  there are also 13-18 year olds on the server who are friendly, kind, and just want to have fun playing everquest NOT at the expense of others.  i know some of those people, and have a good time with them playing the game.<br>

<br>
I originally agreed that this shouldn't stay.  If Alnaron is on trial for past crimes, then post on the older thread.  This looks more like a lot of people bashing on an unpopular guy, and that's not what this forum is for.  I originally would have argued that the thread warns others that Alnaron is to be avoided as a risk to one's enjoyment of the game; then I realized that if the older threads didn't point that out well enough, nothing ever would -- certainly not belaboring the point here.  The trouble there is that there is no longer an older thread, and so this one stays.  So be it.<br>
<br>
Speaking of belaboring the point here -- why here?  It's been said that a guild officer would have defended Alnaron because he's a guildmate; while this is true, the officers of Dark Trinity are not retards.  They're well aware of Alnaron's history, and if someone has a legitimate complaint they're reasonable enough to handle it fairly, right?<br>
<br>
Galanorn:  You killed just about all your credibility the first time you attacked everyone on the thread for not seeing it your way.  Bad move.  Then you attacked Alnaron's guild out of nowhere -- one of those Things You Don't Do Here.  His guild is not ultimately responsible for Alnaron's actions in an individual event.  Blame his parents, blame drugs, whatever -- but don't blame Dark Trinity.  It depresses me that others followed your example in this.<br>
<br>
Plur:  Ease off, man.  Leolan has left this here while it's debated whether it merits a place here.  While that remains undecided, it would be biased and heavy-handed for him to simply remove it.  The day the administration stops asking for the will of the people, Lanys becomes like all the others.<br>
<br>
Karsys:  Xian is an administrator, too.  Respecting Leolan's decisions is all well and good, but it's kinda hollow when it looks like you back him professionally because you like him personally.  That's what we commonly call favoritism, or in some cases, corruption.<br>
And hell, administrators are every bit as entitled to their opinion as you are!  What do you think they are, androids?  They're not abusing their power to enforce their viewpoint upon you (case in point, not locking or deleting the thread).  Why does their expressing their opinion bother you?  Unless you're trying to eliminate an opposing viewpoint with what you have at hand...?<br>
<br>
Crowde:  Admin rulings will occasionally go against you.  Live with it.  <br>
<br>
Uhh, question... Galanorn mentions another player team-killing.  Why isn't that person on the Shitlist?  What warranted singling out Alnaron?  I figure either his reputation spurred it here, or the other offender's victims handled it more tactfully.  Either way, there's a lesson there.<br>
<br>
Guys, consider this <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> really hard</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  When police arrest people, there's a procedure to it.  If the arrest was too violent, or the person arrested treated in any way too unfairly, the courts let him go on technicalities and no one sees justice.  Are you attacking Alnaron here because he was wrong, or because he's down and you don't like him? <p><A HREF=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=45407 target="_new"><img src=http://members.aol.com/ksgawango/myhomepage/tran51.jpg  </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uplurlanys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PlurLanys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/10/01 12:24:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alnaron</span><hr size=1> tranthas think you didn't understand what i said... it wasn't dealing about this thread much either so i edited it out, and it wasn't towards leolan <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://www.everwonder.com/david/tacobell/gallery/2.jpg>

<br>
I just can't help thinking that a simple statement early on by Alnaron's &quot;friends&quot; (don't want to use the other word implying association) could have gone a long way to appeasing the victim and blurring the line between the good guys and bad guys, making the subsequent posts more difficult for the audience to judge.<br>
<br>
The simple statement could have gone something along these lines:<br>
<br>
As Alnaron messed up part of this GM event, and admits that he has messed up other events with no remorse, we will do our best to ensure that he doesn't attend another GM event in the future.<br>
<br>
Personally, I wish Frizznik et al would MAKE it be so....high level assholes make me shudder.<br>

I have just plain never understood the belief that you should approach someone's guild when that person acts like a jerk.  Why?  The guild didn't act like a jerk, he did.  Maybe they should be informed that he acted such and doesn't represent them well.  But why care if you approach the guild first?   Alnaron was the culprit, not DT. Alnaron was the one acting like a jerk.  What harm? You ask?  Well, obviously it ruined this guy's enjoyment of the event.  For what reason exactly?  Doesn't matter if you think it should have done so or not.  It did. So, Alnaron got DTed repeatedly.  Obviously it made no impact on him.  Would I have shitlisted him?  Maybe not.  However, if I felt so inclined, this in NOT an instance where I would have approached his guild except to say that this member is hurting their reputation. <br>
<br>
If I act like a jerk, it's ME acting like a jerk.  You can tell my guild about it, but in a case like this what could they possibly to do &quot;fix&quot; this?    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ueqwysiwyg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqWysiwyg </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(5/11/01 8:28:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alnaron</span><hr size=1> &quot;If I act like a jerk, it's ME acting like a jerk.

<br>
Well truthfully not much...  But I think most assume people get kicked out of guilds for being consistant buttholes but that rarely happens.  As long as a person has someone to group with then there really isn't anything too bad anyone can do to you.  If I'm wearing a guild tag, my actions reflect on my guild.  Not sure why you guys don't get that.  It's Guild Pride when something good but Leave the Guild out of it when something bad. Oh well.<br>
<br>
This instance was not your normal.. He took my Loot instance, but he did have to pay a entrance fee.  I would have been kinda mad to fork over some plat and have Pimm kill me. (same team)<br>

You mean you always treat all members of a guild the same?  You don't like/dislke individuals?  All members of Conquest always act the same?  All members of DT always act the same?  All members of &lt;insert guild here&gt; should be treated the same way if one helps or hurts you?  You can't dislike a guild's policies while actually liking some of it's  members?  No, I don't buy that at all.  A person's actions may reflect poorly upon his guild. But HE is responsible for his actions, his guild has nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
Alnaron was acting as an individual in what he did.  Yes, he was wearing the DT guildtag, but HE was acting as he did.  His guild may ask him to stop that type of activity.  Well, so can the poster here.  /shrug.  Why on earth would you approach the guild he belongs to except to say that he acted this way and it doesn't reflect well upon them?  <br>
<br>
Heh, I'm not sure anyone would be able to explain this to me in a way that I would understand it.  It just plain doesn't compute.  I would usually interact with the individual or group.  I may even approach the guild to tell them what I think of one of thier members and why.  But, I wouldn't approach the guild to do anything about it unless it acted out one of thier stated guild policies.  It's the player at fault here, the guild was just an organization that player belonged to. /shrug. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showMessageRange?topicID=507.topic&start=181&stop=199>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showPrevMessage?topicID=507.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showNextMessage?topicID=507.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.emailToFriend?topicID=507.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.threadControl?topicID=507.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=507.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=507.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub4.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="eqasylumgeneral">General<option value="eqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver">The Shit List <option value="eqasylumthetavernincharacterdiscussion">The Tavern <option value="eqasylumthemerchantsunionbuyselltradeorannounceyourservicesforhire">The Merchant's Union<option value="eqasylumcleric">Cleric<option value="eqasylumbard">Bard<option value="eqasylummonk">Monk<option value="eqasylummagician">Magician<option value="eqasylumdruid">Druid<option value="eqasylumenchanter">Enchanter<option value="eqasylumpaladin">Paladin<option value="eqasylumranger">Ranger<option value="eqasylumrogue">Rogue<option value="eqasylumshadowknight">Shadowknight<option value="eqasylumwarrior">Warrior<option value="eqasylumwizard">Wizard<option value="eqasylumnecromancer">Necromancer<option value="eqasylumrantsandravesbalancingissues">Rants and Raves <option value="eqasylumshaman">Shaman<option value="eqasylumthehallofhonour">The Hall of Honour<option value="eqasylumfrm24">Community Polls<option value="eqasylumfrm25">Raid Discussions<option value="eqasylumfrm26">Guildleaders' Forum<option value="eqasylumfrm28">Admin Use Only<option value="eqasylumfrm30">Gone for good... maybe<option value="eqasylumfrm31">Crafts Guild<option value="eqasylumfrm32">The Bored Room<option value="eqasylumfrm33">Luclin Info<option value="eqasylumfrm34">Beastlord</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#000033>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/beqasylum>Lanys Community Forum</a><font color=#000033> -
