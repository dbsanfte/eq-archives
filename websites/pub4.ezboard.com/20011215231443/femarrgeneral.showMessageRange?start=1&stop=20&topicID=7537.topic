I JUST got done spending 4 hours short of 48 hours on my own Ragefire, and having a really bad incident at the 10am FG spawn for lack of help did not do much for my overall good feelings about the camp, before of course, the patch happened. So now I sit here worried about relogging and finding someone has taken the camp. <br>
<br>
Yeah its first come first serve and I won't hold it against them. Their only doing what prolly any other cleric would do if they needed Rage and there was a patch. I'm just praying it won't happen. After spending 80+ hours on a camp, over half of which was for my own camp, it will be extremely daunting to have it taken out from under me solely because there was a patch and Naggy had been reset.<br>
<br>
Well, we shall see I suppose. 5:40am CST and I'm awake and felt like sharing.<br>
<br>

As this is a proper patch Naggy WILL be up afterwards along with a full spawn of giants. You will need to wait until at least naggy is cleared before trying to get back to the camp.. If you have logged there and are under level 53 then naggy will toast you within seconds of logging in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As to re-establishing your camp after naggy goes down its best to talk with the raid leaders who are taking him down.. Sometimes they will help, other times they take him down for the specific task of establishing camp for a specific cleric <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If they reset the servers, a normal patch etc, then naggy will be up.  Crombattleaxe was nice enough to lead the raid on naggy, and my guild helped buff and also filled out the ranks with 52 and lower twinks.  Its possible if you can get on the phone or in the chat rooms that you might be able to work something out.  <br>
<br>
To be sure, what I would do is get a force together asap to kill the fg's as all will be repopped.  Once FG's are killed, I would sit in buff hall and claim RF camp.  When ppl yell camp check, just yell RF.  If no one takes out Naggy, you will have to assemble a force to do so yourself, but there are plenty of ppl out there who want Naggy, that should not be a big deal, even if you lead it.  <br>
<br>
At this point, if anyone were to come in and take the camp, it would be rude of them, and in my opinion wrong, though technically, its their right I guess.  Only problem I truly forsee is if a guild kills naggy.  In that case, I bet they wouldnt really care bout your claim to the camp.<br>
<br>
Take heart.  If you are under 52, I would log in and let naggy kill you.  Then take your nekkid self and get a force up there to kill FG.  If over 52, heck ya just get banished back to the zone line. <br>
<br>
Either way, good luck.<br>
<br>
Luky<br>
<br>
My camp was 111 hours not including the killing of naggy  - trust me it stinks, get help or take a break.  I would never do the double camp looking back.<br>

Hate to say it, but if you can't commit 72 hours at a minimum to sitting in the lair and clearing FGs everytime they pop between Naggy spawns then you aren't really guaranteed to see Rage and you're setting yourself up for more dissapointment.  <br>
<br>
I was caught in your exact situation 3 times while doing my Rage camp.  The problem is, you get blinded by the fact that you GOT the camp so you sit there without thinking.  You talk yourself into wasting 24, 48, 60+ hours because you say &quot;he COULD spawn.&quot;  Bottom line, he *could* spawn, but to be guaranteed you need 72 minimum.  <br>
<br>
Everytime I ever held rage camp, or tried to get rage camp, or helped another cleric get rage camp, server resets or naggy repops negate anyone's &quot;camp&quot;.  You want it again?  Get there, kill naggy, and claim the camp yourself.  Don't expect others to roll over and feel sorry for you that you spent 48+ hours there before servers went down.   <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9508">Stumpf</a></b>

Last time Naggy went down was last Wednesday after the server crash. This was Lukaria's Ragefire being screwed up by the inability to keep variables from happening and having server crashes. I didn't take up the camp on the basis of he &quot;COULD&quot; spawn. I didn't even know about the patch until after I had taken up my own Ragefire camp. By my calculations by the last time Naggy was brought down there was time for a third spawn. When I found out about the patch that is when it turned into *hope*. <br>
<br>
I wasn't blinded into anything. I don't feel I have wasted my time. In fact I am camped right outside the FG spawn area ready to log right back in, get my friends, clear the FGs and start all over. And this even after a VERY bad situation, as I stated before, with the 10am spawn of FGs and lack of melee to overcome I had wanted to throw in the towel and say it wasn't worth it. My husband thought otherwise and sat in for me while I got some sleep. It wasn't a matter of not being willing to put in my 72 hours minimum in as you put it. When I took up the camp I had full intention of doing so. Finding out about the patch after the fact sorta messed that all up.<br>
<br>
As I said before, I was up, had just logged out and felt like sharing. I wasn't looking for you or anyone elses pity. Don't need it, don't want it, never asked for it. I also never said I was going to have other people do the work for me in reclaiming my camp rights. So before you flame be sure you read everthing that was written and not what you wanted to read. kthx <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uceloria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celoria</A> at: 11/27/01 8:15:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 8:22:05 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.ulujain.org/images/ganymede.gif height=105 width=105></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camping my Ragefire</span><hr size=1> Stumpf...<br>

She does has time to commit to the camp, especially since I ran Celoria for her a great deal of the time in question and I actually did a fair job of pretending I was a cleric too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Ulujain Ebonelphette<BR>

You were in control of it when the servers went down, after Naggy is slayed it should remain yours.  Talk to the naggy raid leader when you log in, I'm sure something could be worked out if everyone remains amicable. <p>Jaeden Grae - Hierophant<br>

I will be on that raid to take down Naggy Tonight.<br>
<br>
<br>
You will get your Ragefire Camp when we are done.<br>
<br>
Lots of the people that will be on that raid have sat with you in that camp.  So I dont see any reason where Kerna(the raid leader) would hand it over.  He is certainly about fair and just play.   The raid has around 60-80 people signed up and he is taking 30ish, so we wont need much help.  I suggest that you have your ragefire people on hand to hold the camp and you send Kerna a tell at 8pm, or have an alt at the lavastorm druid rings to explain the situation.  I have NO DOUBT he will award you the camp.  If someone undercuts Kernas raid then than those people will have to deal with that.  And that wont be pretty.<br>

Woot!  I'm famous!<br>

Yep.  It's not a reservation.  She had the camp and due to VI's patch (emergency patch? how log has this been posted?) her camp is interrupted.  But she's not reserving it, nor is it the Naggy raid's moral imperative to give her the camp.  I just said in my <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> OPINION</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the camp is still hers.  <br>

Triple camps suck too but I'm enjoying this time around a bit more. I have a LOT higher moral for this one than I did for the other. Not because I KNOW he is going to spawn but because all of the support I have gotten from my friends. When your rdy to abandon camp cuz of a really bad situation, you haven't had enough sleep, your emotional, etc and your husband and friends won't let you it makes me feel REALLY good that I have the friends that I do. Yes I still worry about holding the camp in the wee morning hours but hey we'll see how we go and persevere.<br>
Thanks again guys for giving me all the support you have. I SOOOO couldn't have done this without you.<br>
