Sometimes I think I was the only druid at level 20 that knew that SNARE is generally more important then DOT!  There's something truly sad about me, the sk in the group, trying to cast my little ghetto snare while the druid swings a mace the whole fight then needs to break for mana.  Gah.  I understand that when you're new, you don't really know how to play too well.  But I can't believe that every druid I've grouped with in the past week has been brand new.  And so far, not one of them has remembered to snare.  Also, even if they WERE new, you would think that when they notice that the mob is running away and we all have to chase it, and that it occasionally agros another mob and we get an add-on, plus the SK and rogue ASKING them to snare, would give them a clue that we need their snaring skills more then their 1hb skills.<br>
<br>
Just my own rant.  I guess since my main is a druid, I notice where my own class fails more then others... but it really does seem that more idiots play druids at low levels then other classes.  Is it my imagination?<br>

<br>
/g I am Ghetto snaring %t because the druid(s) are too lazy!<br>
<br>
I am sure you will get a response from that.  I love being in a group with lazy people because it makes me shine more.  In a given group you will see the following messages from me for one mob.<br>
<br>
/g %t has been slowed to granny speed (togors)<br>
/g %t has been made to hit like my gramma (listless power)<br>
/g I am poisoning %t making it blow chunks (venom of snake)<br>
/g %t has been rooted so it cannot run away (Root)<br>
/g I am canabalizing to get more mana don't waste heals on me. (Canabal II)<br>
<br>
Gimme a group with a enchie or bard and ill have endless mana.  Do the math if you want on how much mana I use but lets just say I sacrifice almost being 1/2 health the whole time.  But i like knowing that I made my contribution.  <br>
<br>
Oh and IMHO shamans are the busiest class in groups followed by bards.  A good shaman will have all tanks buffed with str,dex,agil,health, tals(hp) and main with chloro along with yourself and have a pet under controll.  If there is no enchie we have to speed.<br>
<br>
My point is there are always bad players or people just riding the choo choo XP train that you have to carry on your back.<br>

Do not group with Hawaii<br>
<br>
I am a druid, and if I might say so a good one. Each class has a job, and nobody is that much more important than another in a raid or a group. Everyclass is busy at what they do. If you  think any other class is not busy then think again, every class is busy if they are good at what they do.  Dont start patting yourself on the back. <br>
Instead of bitching a person out in group say or humiliating them,  perhaps suggest in tells as to what you might want from them, instead of embarassing them in public, which only pisses them off. I had no bloody clue how to kite until level 35, its not a lack of intelligence, it was just lack of knowlegdge which was then imparted to me by some friends. After that I soloed my way from 45 to 53. Even now I ask what my group wants me to do. And then I do it and I do it to the best of my ability. <br>
My point is, dont start critisizing someone, they just might need a little info. Nobody knows everything about the game. not even you Hawaii <p><center><img src="http://members.home.net/fitzpatr/Anasig5.gif"></a></center>

I usually ask that they don't, and take up the job myself.  I am almost always the puller or MT *shudder*, and I prefer to use Snare as part of how I manage Agro.  Usually snare at about 60 health on the mob (ANY Mob, it costs like 15 mana, and better safe than sorry), or when it gets that &quot;Nothin says lovin like Chanter in the Oven&quot; look on its face and dives for the casters.  Plus, about half of the druids I have grouped with Snare too early, either causing it to expire on a tough mob, and/or getting said mob REALLY mad at them.  That said, I do really hate it when *no one* snares, but having the spell myself its almost never an issue:  I trust myself to keep runners Snared, so I don't worry about it.<br>
<br>
And yes, any class, played well, is a busy class.  I would say Bards have the most key-punching, with twisting, but a Caster is going to be busy monitoring the combat spam and health of the mobs to determine when to Nuke, DoT, or Debuff, Healers will be busy as fark keeping the tanks alive while keeping their agro low enough that they don't get et, and the Tanks will be busy working on the mobs and keeping the focus on them.  You may have to cast more spells as a Shaman than others, but in my experience that's usually before or after an actual battle; DURING the fight your no busier (possibly even less, depending on the situation) than any other class.<br>

If there is no enchie or bard in the group and the puller pulls 2 guess what i do.  Piss the one off thats not being attacked and root the bastard.  But I guess me keeping one away from the group is bad and i suck for it.  PARKING is bad mmmkay.<br>
<br>
Adapt and overcome.  Identify deficiencies and fix them.  I give the snarer 3 mobs to show that he/she is snaring if the mob keeps running away i mem root and root it once it gets to 1/4 health.  I am not gonna have adds when we dont need them because the snarer isnt snaring.<br>
<br>
Seems druids will be mad at this when its not talking about all druids just a few.  And the ones that do get offended are obvioiusly the ones who have been yelled at by other group memebers and are in some serious denial.<br>

I do whatever i can to help out my goup with the spells I have and will take my health down to an inch from canabalizing in order to win the battle.<br>

Find out who is MA.  Keep a DS on him.  Cleric buffs, Enchanter buffs, Shaman buffs will take precedence before yours, but that's no reason to not keep updated on which buffs you'll need to slap on.  If there's no shaman in your group, you slap strength on your melee. Keep sow on all your members.  Help save the cleric some trouble and keep regen on your main tank.  <br>
<br>
Snaring, I believe, should be left on the ranger's hands if you have one in your group.  Snare builds aggro, and if you're healing/buffing/nuking or what have you, the last thing you want is extra aggro.  As much as people make fun of rangers, a ranger will last longer if the mob goes to him and not to you.  If you lack a chanter/bard, when the group pulls singles, again, leave root park to the ranger or paladin (if you have one that knows what he/she's doing).  <br>
<br>
As a healer/nuker/evacer/buffer, you're a jack of all trades amongst the priest classes.  You just need to know when to play which role.  When you're grouped with a cleric, that's not the time to go casting your skin spells.  When you have a shaman it's not the time to go casting strength.  When you have a warrior (and I sure hope you do) it's not the time to cast your damage shield on yourself and not him.  When you're short on healing power but you have a wizard in the group, save that mana for heals and leave the nukes to the wizard.<br>
<br>
Sure, this might ask a lot in terms of trust, but you NEED to trust your group members.  I have had druids (and clerics and shamen)  who didn't know diddly squat.  I took time to be patient and ask politely (and consistently) for what buffs I believed should have been cast.  I'm not going to take my time out of meleeing a mob and trying to snare it at the same time, while being diligent about /assisting the main tank and not breaking mez to cast my piddly strength buff on the rogue because the druid forgot.  I will ask the druid politely, &quot;mana permitting, cast STR on the rogue and slap a DS on the warrior, please.&quot;  If the druid doesn't respond, I will ask again.  And again.  <br>
<br>
Sure, it might be a pain but I take it into consideration that druids are a strong soloing class.  Some wait till their 40's to enter their first real group.  It could very well be that a druid who's grouping with me in SolB is his first time grouping since Orc Hill back in GFay.  The situation could very well be that.  Should I be mad?  No.  Should I be concerned?  Yes.  Since that druid's last time grouping, he's gotten many, many spells.  He has to relearn how to use them, when to use them, and if he should even use them all over.  Explain to the druid what you want from him.  &quot;DS on the warrior, STR on melee, regen on everybody, and snare when the mob is at 2/3 health, nuke at 1/4 health- mana permitting, and no DOTs.&quot;  Let him know what his/her duties are and tell him that's what he needs to worry about.  Tell him/her what he/she should not do.<br>
<br>
Take time to explain and take time to designate roles.  We're gamers and not psychics.  Most people will take advice- it just depends on how polite or rude the advice came across.<br>
<br>
Now, lower levels are painful for everybody.  Everybody is learning their roles.  The best way to learn, aside from grouping, is to ask higher level characters.  If you're playing a healer, ask a high level melee nicely if you can ask them for their advice on how to function as a healer in a group.  The other side can tell you wonders.  Once you get up in levels, everybody knows the limitations of everybody else.  A warrior can tell you awesome advice on when to heal tanks as a cleric, a ranger can tell druids about buffing tactics, and an enchanter can tell melee all about mezzes and the importance of not breaking mez.  I remember the first time I really understood group dynamics was watching higher level guildies (way back in the day) kill freeport guards.  Warrior tanked, Ranger pulled and snared, Paladin pushed out melee damage and stuns, Cleric healed and buffed, Druid back up healed, nuked, and backup buffed (plus damage shield).<br>
<br>
A well versed and group friendly druid is welcome into my group anytime.  That kind of druid knows exactly where he stands in a group.  He knows he's not the best nuker, he's not the best healer, he's not the best buffer, and he can't tank or push out melee damage worth a damn, but he can enhance a group's performance.  He sure isn't the star of the show, but he can step in and take up the role of wizard, buffer, healer when need be.  He knows to keep the group updated on his mana and will ask questions if there's something he doesn't understand.<br>
<br>
You have to be willing to stand down in a group.  Sure I'd love to have all the attention the main assist tank is having, but I'll die.  The warrior gets buffed to high heaven and he chooses which mobs we attack because he's the one who can take the heat.  We all assist him.  As a ranger, I accept that.  Sure I'd love to be the one keeping the group alive and accepting thanks, but my 90pt heal won't do diddly squat.  That's why we let the cleric do the life saving.  Instead, I'm happy to find where I am useful and just keep doing it.  Even if it's just snare duty, the group knows I'm keeping up with my job and they like me for it.  I'm also more than willing to eat a death to make sure the cleric gets out safely.  All tanking classes accept that.  Druids, accept you are a jack of all trades and master at none (well, maybe except for being taxis :P ), but find the middle ground.  Even if your group only wants you to snare and sow, do your job well.  Snare every mob and refresh sows.  Be vigilant.  Glory mongering is never appreciated.  <br>
<br>
A successful group is a trusting, humble and communicative group.  It's not about what your group can do for you, it's what you and your party members can do for each other.  As much as I love getting down and dirty with the mobs, I'll never rush into the front lines and out taunt my warrior.  My cleric won't appreciate it and I'll upset my warrior.  The cleric isn't there to live out my delusions of grandeur.  <br>
<br>
Know your limits, know your abilities, know where you are unique, know your group (be watchful of what they do), and know in what areas you are capable to help.  Think over some things and ask people what they think on it.  &quot;Do I need to cast a damage shield on a rogue?&quot;  Answer would be no.  If your tank is doing his/her job of taunting, the rogue will be behind the mob and not getting hit.  Don't be afraid to ask questions and give out advice nicely in a mature fashion.  Unless I'm in a tight situation, I'll always say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thanks.&quot;  <br>

<br>
I am a druid and when I decide to group I stay pretty busy. I play by the rule that it's my job to snare any mob that has potential to run off and cause mayhem. If another player that has snare equiv spells and wants to snare I have no problem.<br>
<br>
 I have noticed playing on alts that many people either forget or simply don't snare. My other favorite as mentioned above is the melee druids who are always oom. I guess it's their choice how they play and if we don't like it then I guess maybe we should find another group. <br>
<br>
And just for some clarification. <br>
<br>
Do Druids have melee buffs? <br>
Hmm Skin buffs, strength buffs, damage shields. <br>
<br>
Do druids have melee debuffs? <br>
yep its called fixation of Ro nice little ac and atk debuff<br>
<br>
Generally while I am grouped I handle snare, nukes, debuffs, sow, regen, damage shield, and occasionaly root mob control. <br>
 I guess I am not busy. <br>

Rooting a mob that is running causes it to turn back and attack us again.  Rooting also fucks up aggro since a rooted mob automatically attacks who is closest to it, not who is highest on the hate list.  Three tanks on one side, me on the other of a rooted mob and guess who ends up being closest at least half the time.  And it just gets worse in a large scale encounter.<br>
<br>
So the moral here Hawaii dude is stop personally attacking people who don't share your opinion all the time.  I am sure Theo doesn't want to have a little talk with you again.<br>
