I think I was a pretty good kid as a result of it, tho I did have my ornery moments.  I think I got beat for being ornery on purpose more often than I got beat for pissing my parents off.  In respect to them, I probably deserved some sorta punishment and if you had asked me whether I would like to get a spanking or sit in the corner, I'd opt for the spanking cause I could get back to causing trouble faster!<br>
<br>
Mebbe it didn't work.  I cuss, i drink beers, i party like an animal sometimes.  Then again I've never been in trouble with the law.  Perhaps spanking helps kids know which lines not to cross?  <br>
<br>
Another thought.  Spanking is a way to artificially &quot;threaten a child's survival.&quot;  Making him/her fear for their own personal safety.  This causes deep-seated instincts for survival to take hold of the child and thus modify his/her behavior to avoid such a threat.  When this stops being effective it's time to stop spanking the child.  I remember the spankings stopped for good at about age 12?  Right around the time puberty hit.  <br>
<br>
Why would you want to threaten your child's survival and kick in those instincts?  Well think if it as giving him/her a &quot;social survival instinct.&quot;  When the kid does something socially offensive, they need to be punished for it.  Time-outs don't seem to work all that well, just strengthen the behavior in the ornery ones.  If the kid isn't taught to not do stuff that's socially offensive, he's gonna really lack when it comes to surviving in a social setting.  <br>
<br>
He'll piss everyone off, make enemies, lose jobs, probably commit crimes, and get sent off to jail.  That's what can happen to a kid if he never learns social survival skills.  <br>
<br>
I do believe that spankings when they occur should be rare and well structured.  And never ever abusive.  I feel the same way that kids need protection from the violence in the world.  Adults beating their kids in public should never happen, it disrespects everyone who witnesses it.  <br>
<br>
ON a related note, after reading Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; the author comments on society's system of crime punishment.  In the author's society, people convicted of minor crimes were given ten lashes in the public square.  People convicted of heinous crimes were given death.  <br>
Heinlein comments on spanking children too.  He gave this analogy: &quot;You have a puppy, it shits on the rug, you ignore this behavior hoping it will stop.  This goes on till the puppy is grown to a dog, at which point he shits on the rug and you take him out back and shoot him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Is that justice?  Some might say the dog was never trained to know what was socially acceptable behavior.  If parents neglect to teach their children what is not acceptable behavior, the kids MAY grow up to be criminals and sitting in a chair waiting for their lethal injections.  Is that justice?  <br>
<br>
There is a place for corporal punishment.  The place and means is a matter of opinion, but I think we can all agree that it should be humane.  <br>

<br>
Bullshit. <br>
<br>
By following this rule, the 'ornery' ones as you put it will act out in public at every chance. And then, if you want to discipline, you will have to wait until they get home. Hm. 30 minutes? 2 hours? When you finally get around to correcting them, however you choose to do so, it is no longer discipline, it is abuse.<br>

If the teacher never writes him up, then nothing is going to happen.  The teacher is not telling him or showing him what is wrong, at least with a paper trail he would get some kind of guidance.<br>
<br>
He is also in a self-contained classroom, which means the breasts he is touching most likely belong to a girl who is also either low IQ or learning disabled.  I don't even know if the young lady is old enough to understand, but as far as I can tell the teacher has done NOTHING about the situation....and that includes talking to either of the students.<br>
<br>
Further, what's going to happen when the young lady goes home and tells her parents she's been/being touched and the teacher doesn't do anything?  We're looking at what could be a major law suit or at the very least irate parents in the office.  What will our admin say?  The truth that they never knew this was going on, that no one ever informed them.  What will the classroom teacher say?  Oh, he really doesn't know what he's doing so it's okay.......So when does this young man get help to learn what's okay and what's not....what about the young lady?  <br>
<br>
It's fine to take the young man's side in this, but please don't forget there are also young women involved....who stopped to think about how they felt?  If they are &quot;normal&quot; students what do you tell them?  It's okay he doesn't know what he's doing?  Or that it's their job to avoid his advances?  And what about the girls in his class?  Do they have the mental capabilities to avoid him?  Do they have the verbal skills to adequately communicate how they feel?  <br>
<br>
If he gets written up, he gets help......or at least it's brought to the attention of the admin.  Because right now, as far as I know, NOTHING is being done.  So, it may have sounded harsh, but as far as I'm concerned it was the best thing to do for the young man, the young lady, the teacher and the school.<br>
