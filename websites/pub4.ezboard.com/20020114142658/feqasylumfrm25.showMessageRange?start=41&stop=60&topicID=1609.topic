Why does everyone keep saying this???  That is NOT true!  To us, the calendar-respecting guilds of lanys, NOTHING IS FFA.  A lot of guildleaders decided it should not be on the calendar, which is *not* the same thing as FFA!  FFA to me means &quot;whoever gets there first with their raid wins, fook the rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not on the calendar means work it out in game.  It doesn't mean &quot;sorry this was voted FFA and we're not moving.&quot;  It doesn't mean &quot;I had it on the calendar so get the hell out you raid-keelers&quot; either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/undian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ndian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/24/01 5:24:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.sagoons.com/~images/thumbs4/slumber_thumb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I was the one about 2-3 months ago that put in GENERAL ...what to do about HOT...i said do we want to use the Calendar as a TOOL for HOT....<br>

That was 2-3 months ago.  People lvl in that time, guilds grow and fall apart.  Guilds that couldn't go to HoT 2-3 months ago, can.  More people are 50+ on Lanys, and the calendar is a good communication tool.  <br>

<br>
<br>
First off i was approched by a very nice person to start with...we started talking and then viper logs in...this person i was talking to tells me they are going to fill him in on what we have talked about and let him take over (I can't remember their name) but not to worry he just wants to know what's going on. I explained to Viper that i was very sorry that we didnt' know about his raid as it was desided months ago that we wouldn't be putting HOT on the Calendar i never even thought to tell someone to look ( i will get into this whole calendar thing later in the post).  I also explained that there was more then one place to camp in HOT ...which i'm not even sure until the end Viper listen to me because at this point he was to busy telling what a bad person i was..and how ROA was dishonorable ect ect ect.  I also explained normally we would move in deeper however we had a new puller that hadn't even been to HOT yet let alone pulled it and it was no more *safe* for us to move then him.<br>
<br>
Now some of this is my fault i didn't make to much efford at this point (after being told how bad ROA was for the 20th time by viper quite frankly i was tired of trying to work with viper) however now that i look back at it neither was viper trying to hard....the only answer that was going to make him happy was ROA leaving....never was there can we combine raids...can we roll for the front part of HOT ...and maybe i should have been the bigger person and been the one to suggest these things however like i said after being told ROA was a bad guild for the 20th time i said piss on it...for that i'm sorry i should have ignored the potshots at my guild and tried harder to work it out.<br>
<br>
Now some of Vita's people seem to think all of ROA is rotten and from this HOT day onward have been nothing but spitful (see some of the snippy comments on these boards) if they want to believe one side (vipers) so be it...i'm not going to plead and beg for them to listen.  However Gusiam's offer was just that ...there was no hidden meaning...she was offering to help and it was Viper that said these raids take lots of planning to get the right classes...she offered herself up as someone he could count on as a meatshield...i'm sure she won't make the mistake again as all you see is a insult.<br>
<br>
I've heard on this thread well it's months later maybe it's time for a change in how HOT is booked...well you are right HOWEVER those of us that agreed months ago are fine with what we have going so let me make this clear...this is the responsible of the new guilds coming into HOT to find out how hot is delt with (from the looks of it that wasnt' done was it) instead they come to the boards and bitch about it.  Did anyone take any time to ask around and see how we had got along in hot for SOOOOOO many months without ONE HOT bitch fest on the boards????? once again i believe it the new HOT guilds responsibility to make sure they knew what/how/where/when of HOT's current system...and if they don't agree with it bring it to their guildleaders so all the guilds could once agian talk about this.<br>
<br>
In closing i once again brought it up on the guildleaders boards for talks....it's a close race..so please don't think ROA is the only guild that thought HOT was not a calendar booking..<br>
<br>
in closing the only vote i will tell you is....ROA voted Yes to use the Calendar however if we get out voted by the rest of Lanys then we will continue to have one of our members check on HOT if no-one is there and no-one has said anything to us about going we will start to make our way there. <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">

<br>
Posting intent on the calendar is just that.<br>
Some people prefer getting a clean (open) day to avoid conflicts.  You can post, or not.  It's up to you.<br>
You may avoid conflict by posting, and you can just as easily create it by posting.<br>
<br>
What is most important is the communications in the game to resolve the conflict.<br>
<br>
If you get someone from the other raid who is not being polite.  Contact one of their guild officers and get someone else to negotiate.  <br>
<br>
It sounds like both raids had good intent, but mis-communication fouled things up.  Just learn from it, so it doesn't repeat.  (heh count to 10 next time)<br>

<br>
I went back and looked at the calendar. ToV and HoT have been listed on the calendar for months. There's an upcoming HoT raid on it now.<br>
<br>
It seems to be clear that the calendar is utilized by the majority of lanys, and that only a very few guilds ignore it.<br>
<br>
I still believe that all the zones/mobs that are deemed to be calendar worthy should be listed in the header of the raids forum. This would really help simplify things.<br>
<br>
The idea of a centralized calendar seems to make perfect sense. The problem of people camping the calendar to claim mobs is an entirely different problem. It is sad, but it happens.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to knock any guild on lanys in anyway. I'm hoping that with some compromise, we can ensure the hard work of hosting raids is not gone to waste.<br>
<br>
I can not see how an open type raid can be scheduled and put together without this calendar system.<br>
<br>
This entire problem with HoT sure does make the giant faction guilds more appealing.  <br>
<br>
Take care all,<br>

<br>
And if you look Kateki, all those HoT raids that are posted are, and have been open raids, EXCEPT for ones made by Me, Errtai, Simc, and a few by Gyn a couple of months ago, the rest of the guilds chose not to post here, and post on their boards if their guild was going in there.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I just went and looked at the calander, and the last 4 months are shown, besides all the dozer attempts that are posted here are the HoT raids posted.<br>

Now with the exceptions of RoAs post, they all say to sign up, so in my mind that means open raid.<br>
<br>
Did i make a mistake when I told riders i was hosting hot, get here? No. Did i bother to check the other guilds websites, yeah i did for a few reasons. Last few weeks only DT had been in there, they LIVED in there, no big deal, not only that, MW TSO and the other guild had not been in there lately, so i made the assumption no one was there, since DT was gone.  Yeah i can admit i made a mistake. <br>
<br>
I like both Azzigoths and Leolans posts, it cleary states, sign up you might not get to go though, and no its closed.  If that is what we have to do until we get our word handed down from on high ( from the pro dragon guild leaders ) that is the way RoA will do it, be it whoever is hosting.<br>
<br>
So, in my eyes us and that particular raid leader were both at fault, lets take this chance and work this out ( again ). <p><center><embed width="200" height="125" src="http://www.crocker.com/~denise/solasig.swf"></embed>

<br>
I'm not questioning your honesty or anyone else for that matter. I'm sure that post existed. I was only trying to point out where the confusion is coming from, in an effort to avoid future conflict.<br>
<br>
The fact that the other raids posted are open raids is part of the reason I support the use of the calendar. It is that very reason that I feel that this is an issue to the entire lanys community, and should not be left to the guild leaders to decide. Guilds come and go, we have seen a lot of that lately.<br>
<br>
To anyone that was not aware of that post, it seems that HoT has and continues to be posted on the calendar.<br>
<br>
I also find it hard to believe that people would not have noticed that HoT has been posted on the calendar while checking or posting another raid. I realize that there are a very few guilds that simply do not utilize the calendar in anyway. <br>
<br>
I have been going to HoT for the past couple of months. Since level 52 actually, and got the BP on my first trip. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
I was even invited to attend a late night RoTA HoT raid the other night. Too bad that pesty job thing keeps hindering my eq priorities. <br>
<br>
My question is simple. Is HoT going to be recognized as a valid listing on the calendar?<br>
<br>

I also appreciate all the responses from RoA, sounds like you guys are willing to make the change as other guilds are finally up and coming.<br>
<br>
I'm a bit curious though, why is this even a close discussion amongst the GL's about putting this on the calendar?  Even if it's voted on to remain FFA it just means that instead of just putting a Calendar entry I'll also have to go to about 6 or 7 different guild boards and let them know my intentions.  People have finally acquired the levels, the problem isn't going to go away just by ignoring it by bigger guilds hoping to have their &quot;HoT Wednesday nights&quot; or whatever.  Are people just against communication to avoid conflict?<br>

But also try to see it from my point of view - to my eyes it looked like ROA just didn't give a damn and after all no effort was made to compromise. You guys were already there and if anyone was in a position to offer to merge raids or roll, I believe it was ROA. That never happened, so it just fed the fire of my anger. I tend to get excited when I believe I'm being screwed with. Again, I apologize because from your posts it doesn't look like that was your intention. We both could have tried harder. I would prefer to work this out and not have any permanent hard feelings.<br>
<br>
One thing, though, about your last post still troubles me. You said that you'll continue to send people to HoT and check to see if anyone's there. If not, you'll organize and head over. You're still not going to check the calendar? That's the same situation that we were in before. Errtai has asked me to send him a tell whenever I'm going to run a raid in HoT. Perhaps you'd be willing to do the same and let Vita know when you're going to be doing it. Vita raids on HoT are going to be the sort that require planning several days to a week ahead of time, with a message board post and a sign up.  I'm going to continue to post my intent on the lanys board, rather than go to ever guild's message board and post there, or track down every guild's officer/leader and notify them. If I see someone else has posted intent there before me, I'll gladly respect that.<br>
<br>
I really think this needs to be a calendar event, and I urge the guilds doing HoT to use the calendar. If not, as more and more guilds are capable of doing HoT, they're probably going to be planned events rather than spur of the moment mini-raids of just 2 groups, and there's more and more chance of this mess happening again. <br>
<br>
Simc/Errtai/ROA - peace.  <p><img src="http://www.vitainfinita.com/images/sigs/vipsig.jpg">

<br>
The other post was how ROA will handle HOT if the vote is NO...if the vote is YES by all means we will follow the rest of the community and not only respect all HOT post but post our raids for HOT there to....until then we will look for raids posted for the same day we plan on going however ROA will not be posting their raids on the Calendar.<br>
<br>
for example ROA will be heading to HOT today since as of 7:30pst this morning there is NO raid planed for today.  Should a raid show up on the calendar from now until the time we plan on heading to TOV today then i guess something will have to be worked out. <p><img src="http://user.netomia.com/Brewhaus/simc.jpg">

If nek/guard/exit is camped, go do the crypt.  Would you feel right about putting that on the calendar?  dhall or discos?<br>
<br>
There is nothing FFA (free for all) about that. It's FCFS (first come first serve) meaning that you might have to readjust your placement or yes the dungeon might be full.  <br>

However I do know that most every major guild besides FL and Visions is Dragon/Dwarf Aligned.  Therefore, which is easier? Do we expect The raid leader to get in contact with every single one of these guild's guildleaders, especially when you throw in that you have to find them online?  Why not Utilize the Calendar.  Im not stating any retroactive change or placing any blame, but this seems retarded!  Why send 40 tells to 40 guildleaders who 95% of the time werent planning a raid anyway? Post it on the calendar, if you want to take a raid to HoT, check the calendar.  Use of the calendar would have prevented this incedent as well as many other such incidents.  So why arent we doing this? Is it that hard? Are we skating by on excuses like &quot;i havent checked the calendar in ages&quot;?! WHO CARES! Lets change how it is, cause the concept of contacting every guildleader obviously isnt working, and sure as hell is alot more work than it needbe... especially with new guilds popping up all over the place.<br>

Some mobs inside should prolly be considered calendar worthy as time progresses but I'm not addressing that here. Since I have backed off my EQ duties I prolly never will.<br>

here is Mithril Web's current calendar stance.  With the reasoning behind it. <br>

You guys would arrive there at 7 EST with 5 groups for your weekly HoT raid, having planned it 5 days in advance, and have no gripes whatsoever about having to cram your raid down one of the side tunnels? or call it off altogether?<br>
<br>
Also, how can you possibly compare something that can be done with a low 50's group on a whim like nek/guard to a raid that normally requires 3 to 6 groups for most guilds? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udaeon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daeon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I live here.... get out.</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/25/01 2:49:02 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.bellatlantic.net/~mezner/hamster4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HoT on Calendar???</span><hr size=1> Hmm.. this topic is still raging on, Eh?

<br>
Btw, the current standings on the vote we had there are 7 &quot;No&quot; votes and 4 &quot;Yes&quot; votes... the majority of the dragon aligned guilds don't seem to be advocating a calendar-stance on the HoT issue.. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I don't believe anywhere in my post I mentioned stepping over anyone's raid. I'm just not going to be posting ES raids there, and not going to be checking too often to see if someone else has one there. If I get a tell that says &quot;Hey, you guys are in HoT! We have a raid scheduled there in one hour!&quot; I will most certainly go out of my way to work with the other raiding party, allowing them choice of camp, and immediately moving to another spot in the dungeon. It's a 70 min timer. We're not talking possibly a lot of planning and effort being wasted, as if someone walked over a Hate raid and wiped the plane - we're talking delaying the &quot;scheduled&quot; raid at MOST 70 mins IF they are willing to work things out. That's a big point... people are relying more and more on the laggy, slow ass calendar that I hate checking, rather than working things out in-game. The immediate reaction to an infringement upon this post of INTENT is &quot;Hey! We had that scheduled! No fair! Get out!&quot; as opposed to what it should be, which is &quot;Hey, let's see if we can work something out where we'll both get a little of what we want, and be completely civilized about it.&quot; Quite frankly, adding HoT to the calendar is just egging on antisocial behavior - people aren't willing to talk to one another anymore, they're starting to rely solely on something out-of-game not everyone even checks, let alone agrees with. While I agree the calendar is a wonderful communication tool for long-timer mobs and zones, it's gotta stop somewhere. 70 mins is far too short for something to be calendar material. <br>
