<br>
Actually on every military base there is a law against littering.<br>
<br>
As for if the punishment fit the crime in that situation? I would think that if that person was made to dig a hole and bury the butt, he would have learned his lesson and not done it again.<br>
<br>
Now, let's talk EQ for a moment. I do believe there is a rule about training people in EQ. Now if someone where to train people and this is seen by a GM, would you condone the trainer telling the GM to &quot;screw himself&quot; if the GM said he was going to Ban him? Would you think that was too harsh a penalty? And if you didn't, maybe someone else did and made a big fuss about it? <br>
<br>
All I am saying is that, in my opinion, you seem to pick which rules and laws are ok to break. That is not justice. Training in EQ will, for the most part, result in some sort of punishment. Either by the GM or fellow players. Breaking the laws or rules in RL will, for the most part, result in some sort of punishment. Either by the police or, in some cases, the citizens themselves. <p>Flubbin<br>

he accepted that risk. You see there is far more to the issue with CE than I am <br>
willing to say here. Til knew who I was and what I was like before I entered CE.<br>
He knew because he was guild leader of Dawn Brigade also. Of which I was a member. In that guild YES I WAS invited. <br>
<br>
No he did NOT take me aside before entering CE and tell me that his officers were<br>
sancrosect and could not be challenged. If he had I would not have joined.<br>
I assumed (WRONGLY) that the guild rules applied to ALL members, not just<br>
non-officers. <br>
<br>
After roughly four months I decided to try playing again. At that time and ONLY<br>
at that time Til mailed me asking me to stop posting on the Emarr board.<br>
And I did. However I did notice that Hoppkins continued to post. He still does.<br>
At that time Hoppkins was NOT an officer. So I mailed a formal complaint to the guild leaders asking WHY is the policy not enforced in Hoppkins case.<br>
Til has a habit of removing posts he doesnt like from the guild board. I asked him<br>
if I had lied in my post. He said that didnt matter. That is where he lost my respect. The truth is ALL that matters. Why cant the guild members see when the guild leadership is inconsistant? If it doesnt matter why not let them?<br>
The truth is that he didnt want to come down on Hoppkins. In that case, he should have told me that. He didnt. So I told them that it was not fair to ask ME to refrain from posting, WHICH I HAD FOR OVER TWO MONTHS, and not ask Hoppkins to also. I have e-mail to back this all up BTW <br>
<br>
In any case the responce was - 'say whatever you want, we are not babysitters'<br>
My responce was immediate, I posted within seconds of getting that e-mail.<br>
<br>
The entire issue escalated from there. Hoppkins continued (and I am sure will continue) to post.  Each time breaking the policy that he tried to force on me.<br>
<br>
I dont agree he is special, I think hes a punk. <br>
<br>
The reality is that CE has no policies. There is no protection from an officer that doesnt like you. If that had been stated to me clearly before I entered the guild<br>
I would have laughed at Til and walked away. <br>
<br>
If Til actually expected me to follow guild policy, he HAD to enforce that on<br>
all members. In which case I would have done as requested. <br>
<br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
If some ass punk LT tries to force a man who doesnt wish to be there to dig<br>
a trench 3 feet wide and six feet deep, just because he tossed a butt on the ground. He is showing poor judgement. It is VERY important that an officer<br>
evaluate what is 'reasonable' in his decisions. If this happened to me<br>
I would demand a court martial and a board of inquiry. I would claim extenuating circumstance. I would be very likely given an article 15 and invited to depart.<br>
If you think that they send men to jail for throwing cigarette butss on the ground,<br>
all I can say is where does that happen?<br>

I dont give a damn who opposes me, even ex-freinds and ungratefull ex-guildmates.<br>
