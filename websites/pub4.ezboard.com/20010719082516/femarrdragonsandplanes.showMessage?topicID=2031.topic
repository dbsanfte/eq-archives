<br>
That's just about the sickest thing I have ever heard. It made me want to go be violently ill. What kind of sick fucking demented bastard would (could!) do something like that?!<br>
<br>
Apparently last nights story was a recap of something that happened on May 31st... two 16 year olds decided that this would be something &quot;fun&quot; to do.<br>

I mean, it takes a malicious little fuck stick to do something like that. But, the world is not getting sicker and sicker. As long as people mature over time, they will feel this &quot;phenomenon&quot; of the world getting worse. It was getting worse when your grandparents were kids, and before that and before that, etc. <br>
<br>
The simple fact is, is that as long as we have something that is considered &quot;decent&quot; there will always be something &quot;indecent&quot; because people break rules. Always.<br>
You see, when you're a kid you don't notice how &quot;bad&quot; things were. Because you're part of it, even if you were a good kid. It's just your environment, you don't notice the hazards until you become aware. Insert 30 years. You're now old enough and mature enough to notice the moral catastrophe's people commit. And your environment has changed, so you're no longer part of it, so it seems foreign to you. Worse. It's just a misgnomer of human kind. In all reality, we are actually striving towards a far more humane environment than ever. But, for as long as we have senseless violent acts, we will have a &quot;crumbling society, bent towards the vaneer walls of hell&quot; <br>
<br>
As for the world getting worse due to animal mutilation, well I assure you this isn't the first or last time this will happen. Sad, but true.<br>

OTOH, Nekiah is right.  People do sick things to those than cannot reasonably defend themselves.  Animals are a prime target for kids.  It sounds like the two who did this were caught -- hopefully they can get some help.  They need it, before they graduate to people.<br>

<br>
Why does an example like this bring this out? Think about some of the following examples and peraps you will understand why I think that YOUR post is sick and wrong.<br>
<br>
THe Childrens Crusade   The Catholic Church arranged the sale into slavery of over 10,000 of their children to pay their war debts from the Crusades.<br>
<br>
The Holocaust in Nazi Germany organized, systematic, mechanized slaughter of 6 million Jews, 800,000 gypsies, etc <br>
<br>
The sale into slavery of  millions of africans by their conquering neighbors. It is often overlooked that the vast majority of American slaves were sold into slavery by neighboring, conquering tribes.<br>
<br>
Need I go on? Why would this one story prompt you to write this post when all the other things going on in the world are so much worse? Why do we mourn a publicity hungry woman like Princess Di who played a cat and mouse game with the press, using them while simultaneously decrying them, or Dale Earnhart who merely drove a race car and was called dirty and dangerous for many years by the same people who deify him now and yet many people are killed in violent deaths every day through no fault of their own. Not by tempting death by driving 170 miles an hour. Not by speeding thru a tunnel to escape the press corps which you use when it suits your purpose.<br>
<br>
Please explain why some admittedly sick act to a cat has moved you more than all these other events to the point where you chose to write about it? We butcher cows and pigs every day. We butcher each other every day. We have watched sick acts on our TV every night since the vietnam war, what is it about some stupid cat that moved you? <p>Merentha,

We all felt that each and every one of those were terrible events, which made the world only sadder with each one. Just look at the amount of sheer publicity surrounding the holocaust to this day. No animal mutilation will ever recieve that amount of human sympathy. <br>
<br>
Turning your argument slightly, we can replace the cat with you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please explain why some admittedly sick act to Merentha has moved you more than all these other events to the point where you chose to write about it? Others butcher humans and animals every day. We butcher each other every day. We have watched sick acts on our TV every night since the vietnam war, what is it about some stupid insignificant person that moved you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Now don't get offended when I called you insignificant, as I'm sure you have just as much worth as me, or anyone else. But the simple fact is, in terms of over all life altering situations, nobody has really done anything to change the world in some large scale. Why is the murder of 800,000 people more important than one? If the entire thesis of murder being wrong is because it destroys the one thing in life irreplacable, life/existance/breathing, than one life should be a big enough travestry. Your life isn't worth anymore than mine, nor those 800,000 people. Nor that one one cat. Because that cat had life. He had a right to life as much as anything else, and when that right was taken away for the simple joy of vindictiveness, then people get offended.<br>
<br>
And, you will often times find that sympathy is evoked in us in the strangest ways. People don't mind violence, but can't stand bullies. People can stand war/gang violence, but they can't stand child crimes. So to answer why she was so offended by the destruction of a &quot;stupid cat&quot;, it was for the simple reason of innocence. That cat didn't do anything to them, nor could defend itself. So, whenever he allowed himself the mercy of another race, we showed him how devious we could be. Almost every item in your list of travesty's has a motivation. Greed. While I am deeply offended by greed, and how quickly human rights are forgotten for the almighty dollar, they aren't what sicken me to be human.  The one on your list that wasn't for greed, the holocaust, has received more sympathy than any other event in the history of man, in my opinion. Because it reminds us how terrible we can be, as a person, and as a people. Only when we are forced to look at ourselves will we realize what we've done, and why it destroys us sometimes.<br>
<br>
So please. don't preach to me about events of the past. We have mourned, and we have moved on. Just because an event doesn't meet your scale of importance, doesn't degrade its worth. The value of a single life is forgotten, until it's yours.<br>

<br>
It's statistically proven that cruelty to animals is just one of the steps to becoming a true monster.<br>
<br>
Jeffrey Dahmer, for instance, was quite fond of murdering animals and stripping their flesh from their bones for &quot;trophies&quot; before he grew bored with that, and moved on to other, more exciting prey.<br>
<br>
Even if you can't find the moment to feel for an animal obviously tortured to death, because you are too concerned over what's happening to the human race, you might want to pause and remember that the human race might be next for these sick little perverts.<br>
<br>
And for the record torture, murder, abuse etc of dogs, cats, humans..etc, it's all the same in my book.  You're just as likely to the other if you are already doing one.<br>
<br>
You can sit in your home, and comfort yourself with the fact that it's only animals, and there are far worse atrocities happening in the world, but those of us who have any background in criminal psychology know that this is just the first step. Practice if you will.<br>

I must say though that I dont see the difference in terms of innocence between this cat and the children who were the victims of the Church's greed. Are you saying that the lack of motivation makes one more notable?<br>
<br>
Also, since an M80 is about 3 inches across I doubt this story very much, unless your neighborhood in NJ has lions and tigers running around whose backsides might accept a 3&quot; cylinder. And I am pretty sure THOSE cats could defend themselves from some sick juveniles trying to do that to them  <p>Merentha,

My sister has that cat now.  He has 1/2 a tail, lost one of his testicles and part of a hind leg.  He had gangrene when we found him, and he went thru 4 surgeries to correct the damage.  Pretty awful.<br>

<br>
But, you're turning yourself blind to the countless news stories, fund raisers, and overall sympathy depicted for exactly what you're saying. In fact, because so much attention is turned towards the crack addicts, and psycho mothers, that we feel we don't need to post about it. It's the little guys, the underdogs we nurture.<br>
<br>
As for the M80 post. It's very feasible to stick an M80 up a cats ass. Not only are they nowhere NEAR 3 inches across (more like 3 cm. About the size of your thumb. Dynamite isn't 3 inches across) but rectal tissue is pretty giving when forced. If a baby kitten can come out of a cats womb, a firecracker can go up it's ass. Simple anatomy. <br>

Why would he make up the story? maybe he was just confused, and they used some other explosive to stick up the cats backside. <p><A HREF=http://www.afflictionguild.com/scripts/member.x?username=Salaiin&charactername=Salaiin><FONT COLOR=blue>~Salaiin D'zire</a><br>

a "Blockbuster" or "Pineapple" are these huge  fat firecrackers about 3 inches wide. They  wouldnt fit in a cat, but an M80 is quite small, say twice the width of a normal firecracker.<br>

<br>
The reason I posted about this and not any of the other daily atrocities is because I heard about this (if that makes any sense).<br>
<br>
I get, if I'm lucky, one newspaper a week. Sometimes not even that. I turn the TV on maybe, at most, twice a month. Main reason being I don't WANT to know all the sick shit that goes on day in and day out in this world.<br>
<br>
During the move, we bought alot of newspapers. Being addicted to the written word, I read them.<br>
<br>
Maybe 3 days worth of newspapers... and there was more sick and disturbing trash in them than I want to come in contact with for an entire decade... a story of 2 men in Texas who did a similiar thing to a cat back in JANUARY... it got a 2 paragraph blurb saying that they plea bargained it down to 9 months in county, no fine (I think no fine...).<br>
<br>
A story about a mother who drowned her 5 (FIVE) children in a bathtub, then called police and said I killed my kids. <br>
<br>
at least 4 stories about some very young child being raped/murdered/generally abused by some sicko... and half the time the sicko was thier mother.<br>
<br>
Several stories about people dying in assorted car wrecks... couple of them the fault was so obviously NOT the dead persons.<br>
<br>
I could go on, but...<br>
<br>
Just wanted to say that the reason that particular story warrented a post is because I live in that area, and it was the only one I had heard of that week.<br>
<br>
Now that I've had a week where I had nothing better to do than read the papers, I'm even more disgusted by the human race. And that's just the MAJOR events... there were countless minor ones.<br>
<br>
Sitting at a friends house waiting to pick up someone to help move. A TV show comes on on the TV that's never turned off unless everyone is asleep. A childrens show. The person I was talking to praising how great it was because it was all about imagination. I pointed out that if said TV was turned off and left that way, the child would have no choice BUT to use thier imagination.<br>
<br>
It turned into a 30 minute argument about how kids need to be taught how to imagine... and somehow, she thought that they needed a TV show to teach them.<br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt; I'm sure my mom can correct me, but I don't recall watching a whole lot of TV ever... maybe a couple of favorite cartoons every day. And I'm sure theres times (still is) when I'd do nothing but veg out in front of the tube for days on end. But in general... I was off imagining assorted weird things (I was an indian princess for a month, with the only &quot;prop&quot; being a tree behind the house... or a search and rescue dog looking for bombs in the (empty) field/park across the street with a rock I would toss as the bomb... or a pony express rider, with my bike as the pony... etc) and I didn't need any TV show to tell me how to do it!<br>
<br>
That is an example of a minor disgust with humanity... I love my electrical toys (obviously) but I'd still take a horse and a couple hundred miles of nothingness over them lol!<br>
<br>
There is no solution to any of this... nothing cut and dried or written in stone... no single quick fix &quot;cure&quot; to solve all the worlds problems.<br>
<br>
But we can still rant about it to our hearts content. <p><center><A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~roseydawn" TARGET="_top">
