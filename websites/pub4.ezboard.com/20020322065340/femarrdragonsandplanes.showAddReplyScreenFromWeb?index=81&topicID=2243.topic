<br>
Miblis opinion - Fuck israel, arabs deserve total control over the area cause they too .. once had control there. When the jews lost the area it was cool because it was a time of &quot;conquest&quot;. When the palestines lost it it was way uncool ... well because the arabs lost it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The way i see it is that the majority of the newspapers/tv networks focus heavily on the israeli retaliation on known terrorist/military sites... while when some palestine run amok in the name of jihad killing lots of civilian its not that bad cause they're the poor oppressed nation. <br>
<br>
Both sides are fighting for the land because they have a history there, but imo the palestines are the ones who will not settle for anything short of total, or near total control.<br>
<br>
With your talk about wanting only a piece of the country it sounds to me as you would prefer if they threw a lot of rocks/sand into the ocean building a small island and then called that Israel with the palestines getting all of israel.<br>
<br>
What if the arabs invaded israel. Would the time of conquest be back again ?<br>
<br>
And no, i'm not jewish. I don't know any jews (afaik) and I've never been to Israel.<br>
<br>
Isn't the size of Israel like less than 0.1% of the total middleeastern area ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulujainebonelphette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulujain Ebonelphette</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#E9D756>(8/12/01 9:20:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2243.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All I can say is...</span><hr size=1> Bubu...<br>

<br>
More or less what I said earlier. Creative cartography in action. Britain gave a sense of nationalism to the Saudi Arabs in order to overthrow the Ottomans and give back Turk &quot;vilayets&quot; to the people who owned them. Without a sense of community or nationalism, the defeat of the Ottomans would not have been possible.<br>
Nationalism, or more correctly, cultural identity had existed in the Levant for years before the British and their overkeen mapmakers but the folk there had dwelt relatively well together. <br>
For evidence of this, look at Communist-era Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union. It took Communism to subdue nationalism latent in many peoples of these two former nations. Things change...the unification of diverse cultures falls to pieces and now we have Chechnya and Bosnia-Hercegovina and Kosovo.<br>

<br>
TheTurks, the Assyrians, the Arabs, Armenians, the Italian descendents of Romans and Venetians, the Egyptians, the Hellenic Cypriots, hell even descendents of the Crusaders can claim as much. All of the above have added something to the Levant, for better or for worse. Tell me, what makes the place more &quot;Jewish&quot;?<br>
<br>
If they were there first, which is the most common argument, then it stands to reason that the non-Native American peoples of North America should pack up and head back to Britain, France, Portugal, the Czech Republic, various countries of Africa, China, Vietnam, Germany, et etc, ad nauseam. Not going to happen is it? If we go on length of tenure, then the Arabs have more right to dwell in the Levant than any chaw-chewing Johnny Honkytonk in Biloxi MS. They've been there at least 2500 years if not longer. Keeping in mind that Arabs are Semites and are believed to share a common ethnic ancestry with the Hewbrews and the Maltese, Assyrians etc.<br>
Yet, as it stands, the Palestinian Arabs are 3rd class citizens on their own turf, like the Tamils of Sri Lanka. <br>

You're joking right? Palestinians get favoured treatment in the world's press over that of the Israeli Hebrew/Jew? <br>
Would you like to prove that? Conspiracy theories aside, a fair deal of the world's conglomerate press associations and newspapers are owned and administered by Jewish people. I'm afraid you're not going to get a real balanced view of the situation there from any newspaper.<br>
What is one of the first things that comes to a Caucasian persons mind when they hear the word &quot;Arab&quot;? Terrorist, extremist, woman-haters, towelheads...ad anon. <br>
And you think the press takes the Palestinian Arabs point of view?<br>
That's funny, in the saddest possible way.<br>

So what do all the nations you named have in common (or most). They all have a country of their own - or a region they belong to. Well the Jews area is israel. What other area of the world would you say that the jews should have a nation in, besides israel which is where they have their roots.<br>

I don't see how you can compare the Indians to Israel.<br>
If the Indians had been thrown out of america, was scattered throughout the world and had recently (within the last 50 years) returned to their homeland and was denied the right to live there then you could compare it, but that wouldn't happen in a civilized area like the US right ?<br>
<br>
The Indians have not been leading a jihad againts the great american evil, and the americans have not been trying to drive the indians into the pacific ocean.<br>

The first thing I think of is to be cautious. The way it is in Denmark I wouldn't walk too close to a group of turks/arabs just because it has been proven again and again that in groups they can be very aggresive, and quick to get very pissed. If they feel that you looked at them the wrong way theres not much stopping them from drawing a weapon. <br>
<br>
Not all are like this. I have friends with their cultural background that are not like this. But when its proven that the crime/violence rate per turk/arab is a LOT higher than that of the average non arab inhabitant You learn to not trust them before you know them. <br>
<br>
As I see it most of the youth culture among the 2nd generation arabs is VERY macho. Its all about &quot;respect&quot; which you get by harassing/acting tough.<br>
<br>
A lot of the older generation (came here in the 60s/70s are generally well integrated, but their kids and their kids kids are in a huge cultural gap. Can't talk to their parent i guess, and therefore hang out with their friends, and with the fuses being short - and usually in groups of 10 or more it gets out of hand very fast.<br>
<br>
After seeing &quot;danish&quot; girls as young as 13 get group raped by arabs/turks that only brag about it. After seeing their total disrespect for the &quot;danish&quot; girls. They look on them as whores, and usually takes every oppurtunity to show off infront of their friends. After seeing how laws and rules being looked at as &quot;as long as you're not caught, everything goes&quot; and &quot;do what you want as long as you're not 15, cause you can't go to jail&quot; you start to mistrust those with arab/turkish/whatever other country background. <br>
<br>
And no. Frankly I don't care which color you are as long you're trying to be a productional member of the society you live in. But if a large part of a culture are not to be trusted, how do you know who to trust then ? It's not about the color, its about the culture and how you behave.<br>
<br>
If half of the servers haflings were out to pk/steal/ks/scam you .... how would you feel about the other half of the halflings before getting to know them ?<br>
<br>
A group of people will be treated with the respect they earn. Thats why neither Israel or the Palestines have a lot of respect, but imo Israel have been trying FAR more than the palestines to reach a peaceful solution.<br>
<br>
Does kicking people out of a country a long time ago give you the right to have it again after they have taken(been given) it back ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
