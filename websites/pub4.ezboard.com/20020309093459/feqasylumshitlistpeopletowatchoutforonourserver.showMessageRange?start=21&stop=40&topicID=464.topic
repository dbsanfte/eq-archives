At this time, none of us in EoN are even sure Vaporise is/was a member, we have no record of him.  You want us to discipline someone (who may not even be in our guild)?  Hasn't that already been done by the people who are SUPPOSED to handle that?<br>
<br>
The post you refer to on the EoN board... you were not the LEADER of that raid.  Everything you posted was secondhand information.  That is essentially why we told you to go away.<br>
<br>
And while I'm responding to idiots... I understand why EoN is on here (so that we may provide disciplinary action IF Vaporise is a member), but what is all this BS with slamming Ultimikik?  Can't you dig up any dirt on him directly?  Are you people really this childish? <p><MAP NAME="DhelteTag3">

This is NOT over yet.  People need to look into this further.  As this is the second successful ninja loot and most things from Naggy are lore, the ninja looter would have had to move off the previous loot prior to last night - need to check all of the characters that this guy has.<br>
<br>
Ultimikk, I feel for you and I really appreciated your initial post, but as he is your brother, I think the ball is still in your court.  Please review the inventory and bank status of each and every character that your brother has access to and then post. <br>
<br>
As the account is likely suspended, I would not expect a &quot;loot retrieved&quot; post to occur for several weeks, but I think that if you were to post that you have &quot;taken&quot; control of the account and will review the account after the ban is lifted, it would be appreciated.<br>

<br>
However, as was stated above, to the best of all of our knowledge, neither Jitsa nor Vaporize are or ever have been members of EoN.<br>
<br>
And to those of you saying that Ulti should be responsible for what his brother did or did not do with is account, please! Do you have younger siblings? When you were growing up, were you able to control ANYTHING your younger sibling did? I know I wasn't, nor was my older brother able to control what I did. Nor were any of my friends with younger brothers and sisters. To claim that Ulti should be held responsible here is absurd. And honestly, I don't blame him one bit for wanting to jump to his brother's defense. I would do the same thing for my brother and sister, and had numerous times when we were growing up (now we're all old enough they can definitely fight their own battles).<br>
<br>
But please do not persecute either Ultimikik nor the Eclipse of Norrath for the actions of someone outside of either force. <p><img src=http://members.aol.com/katjyatheslave/Tarissa/Tarisig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uyouoway.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Youoway</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/28/01 7:53:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ninja Loot of Lord Nagafen (03/27)</span><hr size=1> Ryntis..<br>

told you to go away?, and did nothing?<br>

How is Ulti Being held responsible for his brothers account?  It is RIDICULOUS for you to ask Ulti to ILLEGALLY access his brother's account and look in all the characactes inventory.  Powers that be... PLEASE remove ANY and all references that EoN could be AT ALL responsible for this.<br>

I applaud your effort in trying to get this squared away fairly. Having read only to your first post on this issue, I haven't drawn any more conclusion than you have. Nagafen was ninja-looted, and it appears possible that Vaporise did it. I don't think, having not heard any other information yet, that it would be prudent for anyone to become immediately biased against you. I certainly am not. Best of luck to all of you in resolving this, and most of all, best of luck to Kiras and the rest of the raid party in resolving this to its just end. And also don't let this situation overshadow the congratulations due the raid party for a successful raid.<br>

PS It was my intent when coming up with the name for our guild that the translation from Latin is &quot;Just Reward&quot;, something we all believe very strongly in. I have since found out, however, that there are, um, &quot;alternate translations&quot;.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
Having now read all the posts to here, the first thing I say is Congratulations, Kiras and party, and Thanks to Sollania for handling this so promptly and appropriately. I also wish to echo the members of EoN who have posted, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> especially</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> considering that it appears that neither Jitsa nor Vaporise were ever EoN members. In any case, it is also obvious to me that nobody in EoN, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> least</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of all Ultimikik, condone or support the event in question.<br>
<br>
Again, Kiras and party, my hat's off to you for a successful raid, and better luck next time in getting the scale. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My hat is also off (better get it back on before A Mountain Giant Craig lobs my head off) to Ultimikik for making what appears to have been a superhuman effort in getting to the bottom of this ASAP.<br>

My rl brother is in the guild, he is a de necro pure evil,of course, but if he does something dishonest I am not responsible for him, even though he is wearing the same quild tag as me or is my rl brother.  Each guild is responsible to a degree, but if I say hey SS don't do that or don't say that he will just /flip and do as he pleases. Only after the fact can anything be done to fix it, one way or another.<br>

<br>
For those of you who wish to blame Ultimikik or anyone else for the actions of Vaporise, you need to step back and understand that NO ONE, besides the person involved, had any control over this character.  <br>
<br>
Vaporise and Vaporise alone took that path.  To hold others who had NO involvement in the actions accountable is just ludicrous.<br>
<br>
Ultimikik certainly does not deserve to be blamed for any of this.  From what I understand, he didn't even know the password to the account and the brother wasn't even there at the time of this raid.<br>
<br>
I am glad for the members of this raid who did get their items.  That person is banned, I just hope they learn from their mistake before returning to our server.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Found out that he was guilded atleast at one time as EON.  Although he is thought by his brother to not be CURRENTLY guilded EON, if he is infact guilded EON he shall be removed upon his unbanning. <p><HR>

I'm disappointed in you, hun.  True, Ultimikik is this guy's brother.  True, he does have access to him in RL.  However, this in no way implicates him when his brother does something wrong.  <br>
<br>
I can understand why you may not like Ulti after your falling out with him on the other post, but his actions in this specific case were FLAWLESS.  As soon as he heard what happened, he worked with Kiras to figure it out, and immediately called his brother over and over to get the reason behind this and get it resolved.  The fact that you would immediately assume he is behind it and slander him by claiming he's making up &quot;stories&quot; about what happened not only insults him, but also those of us who trust him and call him our friend.<br>
<br>
Ryntis, you're sadly mistaken if you think that *ANY* guild on this server (minus the few guilds that roleplay jerks) would hesitate to remove someone for blatant theft like this.  <br>
<br>
Honestly, I never remember seeing Vaporise with our tag, talking on our channel, or representing us in any other fashion.  I wouldn't immediately associate him with our guild just because his brother is a member (and a well respected one, at that).  <br>
<br>
In any event, I'm glad to see that things were resolved.  Congrats on a successful raid and some decent loot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

<br>
I was there, and saw it, as did about 30 other people on that raid. I'm saying this so that the leadership of EoN can look at how people join their guild and determine whether there is a flaw in the process. I am *SURE* that EoN is an honorable guild of fine people. This is why it shocked me to see that guild tag on such a transparently dishonorable player.<br>
<br>
Bottom line -- This guy will come back with another PL'd L25 character and try to ninja another naggy raid. One more reason why I think the practice of selling or buying Dragon or God loot is suspect. <p><img src=http://images.honesty.com/h/924/78/29247897.gif border=0></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uinyxdater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inyx DAter</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(3/28/01 10:26:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://facelink.snap.com/edit/raw/rawimage/47/958647.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ninja Loot of Lord Nagafen (03/27)</span><hr size=1> Estopidiera,<br>

I have heard conflicting stories from a couple people about the guildstatus.  I did edit my above posting to reflect the fact that some in the guild believe he is still guilded and as so will be removed upon his unbanning.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
As per our charter, all characters controlled by this person shall be removed from EON.  I personally will not tolerate actions like this by a member. <br>
<br>
Now, as far as joining, he like every other member had to gain the trust and sponsorship of 3 to 5 members(according to when they joined).  But, even with this kind of requirement people can slip through. <p><HR>

You will not see the word responsible in my post or any flame whatsoever at Ultimikk.  I simply thought it would be prudent for Ultimikk to review his brother's account and post whatever items that can be contributed to a Naggy Raid for redistribution, that is all that is contained in the post, nothing more - zero, zip, nada.  If I was flaming or trying to trash someone, I would not have ended the post with an &quot;appreciated&quot; and &quot;respectfully&quot;.<br>
<br>
Is it Ultimikk responsibility to review his brother's account - maybe not (but in my RL family the answer would be - yes, thank the heavens).  Regardless, if I was Ultimikk would I review my brother's account and try to correct the situation to the best of my ability - BIG YUP THERE.<br>
<br>
From Ultimikk first post and all the effort he put into trying to find out what happened, do I think he will review his brother's account and try to find if there is additional Naggy loot in his brother's account - YUP.  But first, he had to be made aware that there may be additional loot.<br>
<br>

Yes, it is true that Uti did try to help.  When this happened last night, I asked my guild who knew Vaporise.  A member knew right off that it was the brother of Uti.  Now, we can not be held accountable for the actions of our siblings.  <br>
<br>
I have many friends in EoN.  Anna, Bee, Bee's Brother and many more.  I don't wish imply that they as a guild are at fault.  <br>
<br>
However, it appears there Uti owns/pays for his brothers account.  This fact does give him, IMHO, some responsibility for this.  I believe that he cooperated and did what he could to try to make it right.  I don't know that more could have been expected from him.<br>
<br>
If Vaporise was ever a member of EoN, I am confident that he will indeed be removed.  <br>
<br>
<blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>I do not have My brother's account information..I called verant trying to find it, I lack the neccesary Identification to show it is mine althogh.

Please keep an open mind and Do not assume anything, Assumptions are the tools of fools.<hr></blockquote></blockquote><br>
<br>
At any time a member of a guild could decide to do what is wrong.  Can you blaim the guild for that?  I dont think so.  They are to handle it.  If they do not, then you have an issue with the guild.  I don't see that as the case here. <p><img src=http://www.eternalsinn.org/./melodist_files/sig2a.jpg >
