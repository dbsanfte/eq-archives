<br>
So that a pattern of behaviour can be established.<br>
<br>
It is quite possible individuals belong to a group that condones, or doesnt condone certain actions.  Informing the leadership of the guild a person is in when they take less than desirable actions helps build a case history about this person.<br>
<br>
One insident, nothing... another,...hmm.. A third... well lets see, it is no longer an isolated incident, and the guild leadership can take whatever action they feel is necessary, since the individuals DO represent the guild.<br>
<br>
In this particular insident, you dont blame the guild for the player, you approach the guild and let them know the player did this. The original poster assumed that the guild would not condone malicious acts of this nature, and made a blanket statement that was in appropriate.  Members of the guild came, and tried to &quot;shout&quot; the original poster down and tell him he had no right to be upset.  It is obvious that in this case , bringing it to the guild would have had little impact, since you can see from Alnaron's response he didnt care.<br>
<br>
Normally, you would bring things like this to the attention of the guild to try trectify it.  You dont hate the guild in question, you dislike the individual.  If, however, you find that the majority of the individuals in a guild condone certain behaviour, you will tend to discount the guild itself.<br>
<br>
Thats how it happens Kalen.  Mabye that helps explain it.<br>

(Which of course will be a long post.) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When I was in high school I wrecked my car (another long story for another day). My high school was 26 miles from my home and I had to take public transportation. I was also involved with activies after school, so would often be at the bus stop in a shitty neighborhood...alone.<br>
<br>
Now I'm 5'9&quot; and think I am far more badass then I am. So when a group of young women from a different culture and background walked up and started speculating about my breeding, ancestory, and personal habits, as well as my race, I pretty much ignored it, except for a few taunts of my own about their obvious lack of intelligence. Usually these types of confrontation end with each group yelling to the other something to the effect of &quot;Your momma&quot;. However I made a fatal mistake. One of the other girls kicked a rock. And I took my eyes off the ringleader. And I got punched in the face. Now, despite the stereotype of females fighting, I don't bite or scratch. I punch, and I fight as dirty as possible. See, I'm going to live through a fight if I'm unlucky enough to get in one, and if I take out your eye too fucking bad. I'll explain it to a cop or judge before I'll end up dead with someone else saying, &quot;Gee I didn't mean to kill her&quot; before their own judge.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my lip split open, which causes your eyes to water, which means you can't see shit. Another one hit me in the head from behind and I staggered. I shit you not, I knew if I fell there was a good chance I wasn't going to get up. This was a not nice neighborhood. And there were 5 of them.<br>
<br>
Suddenly this low rider Impala SCREACHES up on the curb. This gentlemen of hispanic origin flies out of the car swinging a tire iron. My only thoughts were &quot;Oh shit&quot;. He was covered in prison tattoos, and was wearing a hair net, and basically looked the perfect stereotype of a Mexican gang member. He got them off me and almost literally threw me in the car. My only thought at the time was I'd rather deal with having the shit kicked out of me, rather then be transported to another location to die with this guy. I then realized he was APOLOGIZING to me. You see, this was HIS neighborhood. And since he saw it as such, he felt personally responsible for what had happened. He had also seen one of the girls behind me pick up a cinderblock to hit me with. At the very least I was saved serious injury.<br>
<br>
Anyway, he refused gas money, and drove me ten miles to a mall where I could catch the bus. He assured me I would never have a problem again at the bus stop. (Which I did not).<br>
<br>
Now, this guy belonged to a group. And yes, I judged him based upon that group. And in this instance (THANKFULLY) I was wrong. But the bottom line here is that you ARE judged by the company you keep. To me that night this man was a savior...however he didn't get his prison tats for shits and giggles. There were other nights that this man was someone else's nightmare.<br>
<br>
In EQ it's rarely so dramatic, though I think sometimes people try to make it so. But a guildtag is just as obvious a representation of who you're with as tattoos and garments. And the guilds are usually known for being certain ways. Are there exceptions to the rule? Certainly...but someone not willing to do the things that group is part of simply won't be in that group. The man I met that night was wonderful, and had my gratitude. However, I held no illusions about who he was, and what he was a part of. The gang he was a member of was well known for killing people in that city. <br>
<br>
He also assisted me because *I* was a member of a group. I was wearing a long skirt and blouse. (The school dress code required females to wear skirts or dresses). To him I was obviously out of place. He kept calling me ma'am as well. (And I was 16 hehe). Had I been dressed differently, or looked differently he may not have stopped.<br>
<br>
We make judgements daily based on how people look, and what &quot;groups&quot; they belong to. Don't believe me? Next time you're walking alone at night, in a dark and creepy area who do you want behind you. An elderly married couple on a romantic stroll? Or 6 loud young men dressed in black leather and chains. Now the elderly couple COULD be serial killers....and the young men could be nice as could be...but we're going to make inital judgements based on how they look and what &quot;group&quot; they belong to.<br>
<br>
And usually those assessments are correct. Because someone who chooses to act differently wouldn't be a part of a group who's actions they don't agree with or participate in. <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

From what I've learned in this everlasting thread that Alnaron has done bad actions in the past, yet Dark Trinity doesn't seem to mind at all. It seems they want to make me look like I did something wrong by shit-listing Alnaron. I did nothing wrong, the only wrong this that was done here was Alnaron killing his fellow teammate (me).<br>

<br>
Ouch. Sorry for what happend to u. Something similar to this happend to me like 4 months ago. I was approached by 2 guys; each 6'1 or so. They were asking me for my money. I refused, and they went into my pockets. Being pissed off, I took my elbow, and clocked the talker in his face. He fell back. But then, these 2 other guys appeared. One of them, being at least 6'3, and looked like a bus, hit me in my right temple. The 4th one, not being too big, pulled a knife. Someone tried to swing at me then, dunno if it was the guy with the knife or not. They tried to get my money again. <br>
<br>
Considering I'm 5'9, and these guys were all above 6 feet, except one, and at least one had a knife, I figured I'd rather lose a few bucks than be stabbed. So, I didn't resist much; although I did get a nice glimpse of the guys. Unfortunately, unlike you Tarot, no guy came to help me. However, it did feel good knowing that the guy I clocked in the temple didn't talk for the rest of the time. That, and that my friend, who met similar guys later in the day, managed to hit one of them with a bat.<br>
<br>
I know this should probably go in the rants section, but I read Tarot's post, and I figured I should post it here. I live in Brooklyn, NY, and everyone here thinks they're tough guys. I dunno if this is still true, but N.Y doesn't have the greatest reputation for being safe. But really; the tough guy thing is bullshit. Here, people are chicken-shit when it comes to fighting alone. I mean, come on, if you're gonna try to bully someone for their cash, at least have the balls to do it alone. God, why can't people just be honorable, and fight alone.

I'm a female character in game, and also a woman in RL as well. And the incident took place well over 10 years ago. (Now I feel old too) <p><img src=http://forsakencoven.homestead.com/files/Tarotsign.jpg>

i attacked Frizznik 5 times he DT'd me 5 times, then he made me chase him around for my corpse - it wasnt a very organized event at all lol.<br>
<br>
That is the reason he was DT'ed.  He was not DT'ed for attacking members of his own team so please stop saying he was punished for it.<br>
<br>
2nd<br>
Karsys you know I like you as a friend hun but you were on the same team (or so Alnaron says) but did you actually punish Alnaron as you did get to see him commit this crime first hand?<br>
<br>
3rd<br>
Alnaron was shit listed before for his attitude and a few other things but I have never seen him shit listed for breaking the rules of a GM Event.<br>
<br>
4th<br>
Jolted the language needs to be cut back a few notches but being as Alnaron has stated (and guild members have reiterated) that the Guild Leader was on the same team as both of you then IMHO you did the right thing after all the Guild Leader saw it first hand.<br>
<br>
5th<br>
Any SINGLE CHARACTER represents the WHOLE GUILD in your actions and words.  The same way a CITIZEN represents a COUNTRY.  Yes this is a sad fact but it is one that us as humans have followed for many a century.  So yes Crowde and Psychokid (/evil grin) you both are representing your guild in your words here.  <br>
<br>
6th<br>
I am sorry but IF Alnaron really did do that and he was not punished it was probably cause of his level.  It is another sad fact I have seen (especially after hearing from other friends about people saying I don't deserve my epic cause of my level when I worked on it for 24 /played days straight and made 2 levels in 4 /played days where I also did raids etc) but it is a true fact.  People put way to much into levels.  They think levels means knowledge.  But it doesn't.  Researching your class and taking the time to ask others is how you gain knowledge.  After all look at some of the things I have done as a mage.  Killed Kizdean Gix solo at 16, Solo'ing 2 spawn in Lake Rathe at 14, killing guards in EC at 24, solo'ing Slixin Klex at 52, getting my epic at 52, These are all things that I was told I couldn't do but I figured out how to do them and did them.  That is knowledge more than levels.<br>
<br>
7th<br>
Those who are bickering back and forth or making snide comments.  Please stop.  All the bickering does is increases flames and all the snide comments do are increase flames as well.  Plain and simple Alnaron broke the rules in front of his Guild Leader and has not been punished as far as what I have read.<br>
<br>
8th<br>
Now lets all hug and make up okey dokey?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
