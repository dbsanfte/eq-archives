I just need to know.<br>
<br>
When you turn in the pearl to Zordak in SolB, does another Zordak -immediatley- spawn in Skyfire?  Or is the Skyfire spawn totally unrelated to the SolB spawn?  <br>
Do I need to have a buncha people waiting in Skyfire to pull Zordak when I turn in the pearl?  <br>
Heheh, just wanna make sure before I do something stupid and have to restart my epic.<br>
<br>
Also, if he is a random spawn, is the Ragefire spawn in Skyfire FFA?  Or do you have to post on the Raid Calendar (Wherever THAT is) to stake a claim?  Thanks for any help you can give me!<br>

<br>
1. The spawn in Sol B and the spawn in Skyfire are independent. Doing one does not cause the other to spawn. They have nothing to do with eachother. AT ALL. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. The Skyfire Ragefire is a STATIC (not a wandering) spawn, but his timing is random. He has a long repop period (currently looking like 0-2 days after a patch, and 4-6 days thereafter, far far too long <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Being static, however, you can if you have the huge time needed, decide to camp him.<br>
<br>
3. You can camp him day and night. Or you can pop in from time to time to look. That's up to you. You will be very lucky now that everyone knows how this new spawn works to find him up by just looking, with no other cleric there already (but it could just happen).<br>
<br>
4. You cannot schedule this on the calendar. Don't even think about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5. If you are camping him alone, for days and nights (somehow), and he pops for you, most others would respect your camp IF you have a raid force strong enough to kill him on the way to help you very quickly. You don't *have* to have anyone else there with you, as long as they can get there fast. VERY fast. If you do camp him, it is better if you camp him with your cleric, not some alt monk or such, as someone who is sitting next to you camping him with their actual cleric chracter will not be impressed by that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You could log the cleric at the camp and sit there on a safer alt though.<br>
<br>
6. If you are camping him with other clerics there (this is likely), you can negotiate with the other clerics there, and that's between you to decide how you will handle it if he pops, and it will depend on your attitude and the attitudes of those who are there also. All clerics have to go through this trial of pain, so be nice to eachother. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yesterday I (well, Mage Suzanna) came to help one cleric kill Ragefire, to find two clerics were there and that they had agreed to roll on who got the drop, which they did. It was handled very civally and honourably (and no doubt heartbreaking for the one who didn't win the roll).<br>
<br>
But you better be fast, and have 4 or 5 or more very strong groups ready to come help you at a moment's notice. Not easy to do for non-raiding-guild folks. Don't expect another raiding force to wait if you cannot get folks there if its a bad time for you, nothing you can do in that case except help your fellow cleric or leave.<br>
<br>
7. On Lanys, some people will not respect the camp at all, and will not negotiate at all, and will consider the spawn fully FFA, and will not care how long you have been there or even if you have a raid 60 seconds away or even in zone already but not quite ready. No matter how rude this is, there is nothing you could do but either accept it quietly, or socially slam such behaviour with all your friends afterwards, to isolate this kind of attitude, but it will not change the result, so be warned of this. Verant will not get involved unless your raid engaged Ragefire first and then another raid attacked him.<br>
<br>
8. There are a lot of views of clerics on this spawn on ALL servers on www.eqcleric.com, go to the message boards, and then to the Quests Forum. You will find a wealth of advice, comments and opinions there.<br>

That's not epic, that's pathetic.<br>
<br>
And before you go thinking &quot;well, sure, you have the guild to back you up&quot;, I had this epic over a year ago, and had it before &lt;Mithril Web&gt; went flying over my head.<br>
<br>
I remember dying to Lord Bergule (or whatever his name is) like 3 times, before I finally realized that there was a druid mob right there as well, so I contacted a few druids, and finally found one who needed their goblin, so we duoed. I remember killing the mob on the shore 3 or 4 times before hand in, to make sure I had the strategy and tactics to kill him solo, and knew how they would act. Then called in a few friends to come help me anyway because I kept running out of mana halfway through second battle.<br>
<br>
I remember already hating that run across TD, and knowing I'd be doing it a LOT.<br>
<br>
The hardest part for me, by far, was Chardok. Wandering there, sitting, and for the next 3 weeks, logging in on a nightly basis and finding out what guild was heading in to raid, and asking if I may partake, not raiding, not xping, sitting on my ass for 3 weeks asking. Finally Kezzer sends me a tell and says yes, on Mothers Day, and in we go. Note gotten.<br>
<br>
The very next day I get a port to Lava, find Rage up. I'm amazingly happy. I immediately do a who all friends, and send the tells out. Tells come pouring in, people are looking for porters but everyone is at the druid best of the best <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but they manage to get there. The entire time, my heart is pounding because I know at any moment &lt;Another Guild&gt; can come pounding through and rush to him, but I am determined to be first...it was *my* time.<br>
<br>
And it was. We spawned the dragon, we killed the dragon, and all of my work had come to fruition. At the time, a /who all ordo would have shown a 50th level me, and a all time high of 30th level from the other 6 members of the guild :P And I *won the race anyway*. <br>
<br>
If I had gotten to that lair and someone else had said &quot;Oh, well, we've got people on the way too, and you need to roll, or we're going to call you greedy and dishonorable&quot; as some sort of stall tactic, I would have turned and walked away in sheer disgust. Epic? Take a number. Ding. Next. Whatever. I'm just glad the majority of the server doesn't share that attitude.<br>

The nice thing about true friendship is that you are free to have your own opinions. Brizzo was MORE than aware of what I and many others thought of what was going down. We didn't race because he asked us not to. End of story. Doesn't mean that I don't think rolling for rage is lame as shit.<br>

Brizzo was more than aware of my thoughts on this matter.<br>
<br>
And even if he 100% supports rolling for rage, that doesn't mean that I am suddenly going to shut up on the boards about how lame I think it is. Fortunately for us, friendship != brain control.<br>

There is no lack of respect in the race. Unless someone is so bitter at having lost the race that they can't be happy for the Cleric who was the most prepared to take home their epic that day.<br>

Having already spoken to Brizzo in game,  removed my post in an attempt to not start a war between friends. Unfortunately I was a little slow. Sigh.<br>
<br>
Well, you can hold whatever obnoxious views you choose, and indeed, you hold them on a range of subjects. All for greed and rude behaviour to others, thats baby cleric Rugen.<br>
<br>
Wake up you fool. Brizzo made the right choice, the only one he could have made. Yes  I know if it had been you, you'd have tried to forced your friends to take Rage from the other cleric's forces there BY FORCE, and claimed FFA as an excuse for your greed, but hey, not everyone is that rude. Some have more honour. Including most of the wonderful people you share a tag with. You need to learn some lessons on behaviour from them. Or join a rude FFA guild. /shrug<br>
<br>
Again, do you realise who you are embarassing with every post you make?<br>

And look at your wording. &quot;take rage from that other cleric's force&quot;. No one is &quot;entitled&quot; to a mob.

I sincerely doubt my guild is embarrassed that I think for myself. And you're the one that took it to a specific incident. Read my original post. I said nothing other than &quot;if I had been asked to roll&quot; what I would have done and WHY I think it's crap to roll on your final epic battle.<br>
<br>
But god yes, I'm such an embarrassment to my guild.<br>
<br>
Here's a hint, toots. You may follow us around like a little puppy a lot, but why not let my GUILD decide who and what they are embarrassed of. <p><center>

<br>
LOL.<br>
<br>
Your personal beliefs are inherently greedy to my mind (like all who believe Might Makes Right). You choose that bed, lie in it. You are rude on every post you make on every thread. Your implicit suggestion my remarks were targetted at anyone other than YOU are deliberately falicious, however.<br>
<br>
I angrily posted to defend Brizzo and Lashanna from your arrogant attitude, which whether you pretend now is the case or not, was who you were condemning. Brizzo for not being the arrogant person you are, but a calm and honourable person. Lashanna for daring to win the roll. You are a coward too now, try to imply that it was not that incident you referred to. But as ever with you and certain others, it's a waste of breathe, and my posting at all was a mistake. Let the rest of the community decide who is interested in fairness to others, and who just wants to advocate steam-rollering anyone they can.<br>
<br>
There are I think 2 or 3 threads on General you haven't posted to yet. Think you'd better hurry off to them now, there's a good little board troll.<br>
<br>
I will post no futher in response (of course, giving you the last word, LOL).<br>
<br>
Sigh, this is what you get for offering some advice to someone. <p>------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>

Felis, it's no secret that we loathe each other. But the above is pure crap. I have *never* in ANY discussion of Rage, before and after MW, before and after the incident you are so hung up on, done ANYTHING but advocate that a list/rolling for the mob is lame. Why did you think my opinion of this would change just because a friend thinks differently?<br>
<br>
There is nothing in my original post that set you off talking about the incident you are so hung up on. There is, however, consistent beliefs on my part that rolling for an epic battle doesn't make it very epic at all.<br>
<br>
You took it there. Not me. <br>

I have been camping Ragefire for six long months now, and needless to say my luck is horrable.  I've spent over 5 days RL time starting at lair in solb.  I've sent over 6 days RL time starting at the dull landscape of SF.  When I saw Ragefire up I almost died I was so happy.  I called on a ton of friends and my guild to come help me snag him.  I saw no other clerics in the zone and figured I'd somehow caught him before anyone else.  As people started comming in I was so scared that some of the bigger guilds would pop in and take him down.  <br>
<br>
After we had a ton of people incomming and some in the zone Adjani  tells the guild, &quot;WAIT&quot; and we find out Brizzo had also been camping him.  My heart froze since I figured this would be yet another time I will miss out on him.  When Adjani told me they had agreed to roll I was heart-vroken since I have a streak of loosing rolls like no one else I know.  I said yes and decided to stick around to help no matter what.  After 6 months and 11 days worth of camping Ragefire I was not about to say what? roll? that's BS! No way! I'll just wait till he is up again.  <br>
<br>
If camping a mob for 11 days of my life it's &quot;epic&quot; enough, and because a roll was involved it would make it any less epic, there I think you are wrong Rugen.  Rolling at times can really suck for an epic. Yet just because you are rolling doesn't make it any less &quot;epic&quot; then if you happen to get lucky and be the only one to see Ragefire is up.  <br>
<br>
I knew I was going to feel bad either way this turned out, I always do when this kinda stuff happens. But some luck I actually won the roll and we took him down.  Do I wish we didn't have had to roll? yup. Did I feel bad for Brizzo? yes. I've been there so many times I know what a heart ache it is. <p><center><img src="http://students.washington.edu/zip/eq/sig.jpg"></center>

<br>
I have no doubt that we will get Brizzo his epic. <br>
<br>
Felis made it about your specific incident, not me.<br>
<br>
As for why I am so against rolling? I'll write a bit tonight that might at least make my stance (which despite all of his attempts to make me a greedy lewt grubbing whore) Felis has never understood.<br>
<br>
For now, I need to get to work. But Lashanna, I'll say this.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you have your epic. Any words I write about rolling and my disgust with it as a principle are not directed at you or any cleric that gets their epic that way. It's frustration and annoyance with a mentality and system (sort of like Felis' annoyance and frustration with what he views to be the &quot;ubers&quot; system and mentality). I differ, however, from the FFA guilds in what I think about the rolling/list system is screwed up.<br>
<br>
I'll explain more later. <p><center>

It's a slow night at work :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Why I hate the Roll</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
First, in order to understand why I have such a strong view on this particular topic, you need to understand the kind of player I am. I'm an RPGer from way back, and one game, I gm-ed the same world for 5 years with the same core of players who played 3 different generations of their first characters family. I have a great love of the epic storyline (thx robert jordan), and I came to Everquest *thrilled* at the prospect of an RPG where the people around you knew nothing of you but what the model looked like and what you presented to them....let's face it. Playing a table top, it may be &quot;Ludwig the Big Bold and Beautiful&quot; but you're still looking at Vinny and his pot belly and bad haircut.<br>
<br>
You see, I'm not anyone special in real life. I'm a 30 year old guy that writes plays and short stories in his spare time and does UNIX administration for a living (because being a playwright, even a popular one, is the same as starving to death :P). I, and many others, drawn to the fantasy genre come here because of the concept of being &quot;the average joe that rises to the level of hero&quot; that we have read time and time again in our pulp fantasy novels. <br>
<br>
I dove into EQ head first, creating a barbarian shaman on Mithaniel Marr, and she was one bawdy wench who kept her barbarian warriors in line. It never really dawned on me that while I was roleplaying, THEY weren't, which created all sorts of bizarre situations once it occurred to me that they thought I really WAS her. But that's beyond the point. The point is, I threw myself into the character, and the quests....I loved the totemic armour quests.... In fact, I love the quests in this game more than just about any other aspect.<br>
<br>
When I came to Lanys, I made Rugen and I decided I'd be much less Roleplay than I had done with Kal, just so as to avoid such horribly strange situations as I was in there. But that never changed my internal monologues. The Plane of Growth raids? It may have been a fun raid, lewt, and whatever to other people, but it was always a vendetta for Rugen to take to Tunare the slaughter of his people right to the goddess that smiled upon her druid's actions. <br>
<br>
All my &quot;life&quot; as Rugen, I've stuck to that model that draws me to the epic story. Average Joe that becomes a *hero*. I went to do my entire gold suit from Ro at 20 so that I could be dressed in gold for my wedding to Cubbie. &quot;Oh, you're crazy! Some of those mobs are in really dangerous places...they are too hard, you'll never do it. Just level, you'll be able to do them with ease later. blah blah blah&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't care. Heros never listen when they are told something can't be done, because they know better. Or are just too stupid NOT to know better. Either way. I did it. Because it was there, and I COULD.<br>
<br>
And I was so damn proud. Stupid, I know, it's a video game. But the character's story and overcoming odds people didn't think I could, made it all the more worth it.<br>
<br>
So what does this have to do with hating the roll?<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll never get your epic without an uber guild. You'll never get your epic at 50, just level to 60 and then get it. You'll never get your epic because Rage is a contested spawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
But Rugen was too stupid to listen to people, and he did it anyway.<br>
<br>
And be damned if I didn't feel &quot;a hero&quot;.<br>
<br>
I hate the roll because it tells people that they aren't good enough to be the hero of their own story. I hate the roll because it makes people buy into the bullshit that only an uberguild can be the hero in a FFA world. I hate the roll because it (in my eyes) is an admission of &quot;I can't do this except the easy way&quot;.<br>
<br>
I've always been too stupid to believe any of that, and any cleric that sends me a tell about the epic quest (and there are a lot) usually starts out with &quot;I know I can't do this til I quit my guild and go join an uber guild, but.....&quot;<br>
<br>
And I stress to them, as hard as I can, that none of that is true. You can do your epic in a small guild, you CAN do your epic before you are 60, and you sure as hell CAN beat an uberguild to a mob. If you want it bad enough. <br>
<br>
Heros don't ask the rewards or the bad guys to line up and wait for them....ala:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.darke.net/journalpix/epicpost.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
That comic sums up a lot of it for me. <br>
<br>
So yeah. I do support the FFA on Rage. But it's not because I'm a greedy grubby bastard like Felis would like to believe. It's because I loathe what I see as the inherent message in the roll. <br>
<br>
Why don't we have any stories of King Wilbur of Camelot because he and Arthur rolled over who got the sword? Because that's not the story of a hero.<br>
<br>
So yeah. I despise the roll, and I'm pretty darn vocal about it. Do I fault someone for taking the roll and getting their epic? No. It's a great item. I just wish it were more about the epic struggle and story of a hero winning despite all the odds, and not so much &quot;the odds are too hard. let's roll.&quot;<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
If that's not clear, I'm not sure how to make it clearer.<br>
<br>
For every hero, there's 100 people standing around going &quot;I could have done that.&quot; with a silent &quot;if it were less of a challenge&quot;. Only in EQ have I ever seen people/RPGers strip the challenge and make the tale of a hero into a mechanical process with no meaning. /shrugs<br>

<br>
I was in Ordo Ursi Prismatus when I got my epic. At the time I got my epic, there were 13 other players in the guild, and the next highest was level 30. <br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
And that attitude is precisely what I am talking about. All these &quot;roll for your epic/we need a list&quot; folks are so desperate to convince people that you don't stand a shot at your epic unless you &quot;have a guild to get it for you&quot; or you subscribe their list/roll ideal, that they've convinced a lot of people that it's just not possible any other way. And that's crap, plain and simple. <br>
<br>
Dare to be a little different. Believe different. Be a hero and overcome the odds, not just another number in the line. It's your story....<br>

Let me give a bit of a background for those who don't know me too well.<br>
<br>
I am Adjani Tristesse, phantasmist and guildleader of TRK.  TRK used to be (well it still is, just not quite so small anymore :P) a very small, selective, family type guild...when I got my epic, there were far more out of guildies than there were guildies at my raids.  I lead raids...lots of them.  Most of them have been open.  Some of them have been assembled spur-of-the-moment.  Most of them have accomplished things that were far beyond what people expected of them, and I like to think all of them were very efficient.<br>
<br>
I have heard the story of how Rugen got his epic many times, and all the controversy surrounding it.  I even remember talking to him at times while he was camping parts of it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I have always respected him for his determination, his will to fight against odds (in RL and out), and some of his thought provoking opinions on issues brought to the boards, although lately I have not been checking them very often.<br>
<br>
However I strongly disagree with him here, and whether he intended it or not I do feel insulted, I feel as if my guildie were insulted, and I feel as if his guildie were insulted.<br>
<br>
I was on a mule when Lashanna's rage-camping rangur excitedly told the guild that Rage was up and there were hardly any high levels in zone, and no clerics!  I logged on Adj, sent some tells, and had everyone on the way to Skyfire.  We may be a small guild, but we, like Rugen, have no shortage of friends and we had a Rage-capable force assembled in Skyfire in under 15 minutes, and more streaming in.  We had maybe 2-3 groups in zone when Brizzo told me that he, too, had been camping it and a force was on the way.  I quickly /who'd the zone and found one MW in the zone...him.  There was one group or so of IS peeps there, to help Lash I think, a couple random folks, and the rest were people we had brought.  But I do know that MW is a guild quite capable of assembling a raid force quickly, and I had no doubt that when he told me forces were on the way but waiting on his &quot;all clear&quot; call, that he was telling the truth.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.  I do not race to mobs.  I do not &quot;trample&quot; over others who have committed time and energy to things.  AND MW is the guild on the server that I look up to the most, as an example of consideration, kindness, and respect...not to mention that I have a lot of friends in the guild.  I would not race against MW.  None of my guildies wanted to race against MW.  And Lash certainly didn't want to race.  Neither did Brizzo, as I would honestly expect from any MW member....<br>
<br>
Brizzo and Lashanna agreed to not have any nastiness, raid forces running over each other, hard feelings, flamage in shout and ooc, or anything of the sort.  They agreed to a peaceful and &quot;fair&quot; (as fair as could possibly be achieved) settlement, a roll, and not only that but whichever cleric won would receive assistance from the other raid force just to make sure Ragefire went down, and as a token of goodwill.  And that is how it happened.  MW stayed to help Lash just as TRK + friends would've stayed to help Brizzo, had he won.  And both guilds respectfully settled the conflict and left the event just as much friends as we had been before.<br>
<br>
If we had raced, TRK would've won.  I knew that when I made my decision.  In fact I had to convince some guildies that we were not getting the sore end of the deal, considering that we had a raid force there and MW didn't.  I didn't want to screw over Brizzo, get involved in a nasty race, and have permanent hard feelings between the two guilds, so I did what I thought was the honorable thing and asked both clerics for a roll, instead of doing what I well could've done and said &quot;tough, we have peeps here and you do not, that's just the way it works.&quot;<br>
<br>
HOW IS THAT LAME???  Please explain it to me.  If Sir Arther of Camelot led an army to slay a dragon, and came upon another army wanting to do the same thing for the glory of THEIR realm, would he have his knights trample them over so that they could slay the dragon first?  Or would he ask the other army to join him in the battle to slay the beast, and that they would draw lots on who carried home his head?<br>
<br>
Is it lame that I offered your guildie a chance at the epic he has been camping just as hard and long as Lashanna, and was also assembling a force for, instead of steamrolling him over?  Would it make Lashanna's epic more valid and worthy if we HAD steamrolled right over your guildie?<br>
<br>
Now I will respond to some of your statements.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   I'd have walked away in disgust if I had been asked to &quot;roll&quot; for my epic. That's not epic, that's pathetic.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, I'm very glad for the sake of guild relations that Brizzo does not feel that way.  Had Brizzo said &quot;that's pathetic&quot; and walked away in disgust when I asked him if a roll was all right, my opinion of him and of MW would've been quite tainted, as would it have been with all of TRK.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And I *won the race anyway*.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But you didn't race...there was nobody racing you.  Nobody contended your Ragefire.  If someone had beaten you there yet offered you a roll (whether or not you had taken it) that would have made them lame?  Since yours happened to be uncontended, it is somehow more valid than Lashanna's &quot;pathetic&quot; epic?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   There is no lack of respect in the race. Unless someone is so bitter at having lost the race that they can't be happy for the Cleric who was the most prepared to take home their epic that day.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
On the contrary, you will find that pretty much all of TRK and (from my experience) many of your guild disagree with you.  If I had totally ignored Brizzo's tell and his time camping Rage, and raced to the spawn and keeled him as MW got there, there would be a lot of hard feelings and lost respect on BOTH sides -- not just the losing side.  Winning a &quot;race&quot; would've given us no satisfaction, and forcing us to race would've caused us to think much less of MW.<br>
<br>
I respected Brizzo's time and effort just as he respected Lashanna's.  If that's not respect, I don't know what is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Wow, slipping to personal attacks, Felis? How the mighty have fallen<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't think personal attacks on either side are warranted or ever necessary...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   If it had been me, Rage would have been dead while you were still waiting for your MA to arrive. /nods There would have been no debate about who was ready and who wasn't.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I really doubt it.  I am sorry you doubt my ability as a raid organizer and leader, even when I have a head start, but I am confident enough in my own abilities and past experience to know that if I were forced to race, I could hold my own.  There's a big difference between not being able to race and choosing not to race.  You know what they say about the rat race, right...?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You might have been very surprised to read our /gu that day then or what MW's stance on epic and ffa mobs is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'd actually be really curious to read it.  MW has changed a lot since the &quot;mass exodus&quot; to DAoC....I would be very interested to know MW's new stance on FFA, racing, etc., and if they support or tolerate the views you expressed put into action.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  done ANYTHING but advocate that a list/rolling for the mob is lame<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't get your association of rolling and lists.  Far as I know, we have no lists for any epic mobs on this server.  However when conflicts occur between raiding forces over epic mobs they are often rolled on, which is a totally different scenario altogether.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Again, this was not about specific people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Felishanna posted about a specific incident, and you called the occurence in that incident lame and pathetic.  You went on to describe how situations LIKE that are lame and pathetic.  No, you never said that Lashanna, Adjani, and Brizzo are lame and pathetic but that makes it no less true that if A=B and B=C, then A=C.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I hate the roll because it makes people buy into the bullshit that only an uberguild can be the hero in a FFA world. I hate the roll because it (in my eyes) is an admission of &quot;I can't do this except the easy way&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
1. Isn't a primary quality of being a hero being honorable and respectful?<br>
2. How is offering someone a roll instead of just taking the spawn &quot;the easy way?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Why don't we have any stories of King Wilbur of Camelot because he and Arthur rolled over who got the sword? Because that's not the story of a hero.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Why don't we hear any stories of King Arthur of Camelot who trampled over his kind brother's army to get to the holy grail first?  Because that's not the story of a hero either.<br>

<br>
First, you say this game is to make the average Joe turn into a hero. That is true, this game allows people to create a character who can accomplish some insane feats. Killing a Deity? Slaying some mighty Dragon? We can all do it, if we develop well enough.<br>
<br>
However, this at the same time provides a paradox. Since <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> everyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> eventually becomes a hero who slays Dragons (well, those that get high enough levels anyway) and such, they inadvertendly become the average Joe again.<br>
<br>
I know I am a damn good Cleric. People tell me so quite often. But how does that make me stand out? How does that make me &quot;special&quot; above any other Clerics who are damn good as well? From a personal point of view I stand out of course - but for others? Well, maybe my brother and some people I know in real life, but other than them?<br>
<br>
So at times, even though we really like to be that hero, we must make a step to the side and leave room for that other hero.<br>
<br>
Rolling in the game is merely a technical tool to decide upon who gets to be in the spotlights, when there is only room for one with three people who want to be in it, or something like that.<br>
<br>
To roll means that you respect the fact that the others are entitled to their moment of glory just as much as you. And when only one can win that moment of glory, it takes a chance. Rolling - how unheroic ever - enables to make a clear determination. When no other discrimination is possible, it is the only way to see who gets it.<br>
<br>
I don't know where I saw it, but someone once said this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you want to win something, you must be ready to fail at getting it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Even so, if you do roll and loose the roll, thereby more or less &quot;officialy&quot; settling who gets his moment of glory, you also win. You win the respect from that other. One day, your turn will come. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but maybe the day after that? Or next week?<br>
<br>
Yes, I do want to get my Epic as well. I am down to the King and Ragefire now. But only once the SkyFire spawn is up, will fate decide for me to have my moment of glory or not. I will abide by that, knowing that the next Cleric wants it, just like me.<br>

I don't think she means that everyone is entitled to the same glory.

But since we want to get into specifics...I'll help out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>

<br>
And then sat there for the next hour buffing and waiting on your MA. We could have killed it and been gone in that time. Now, I know your skill as a raid leader, and perhaps that downtime was simply because the pressure of the race was off (more than likely the case), but for many instances/people, that's NOT the case, they really spend 1-2-3-4 hours getting people there, buffing them...oops wrong buffs. rebuff. oh 9 people LD. etc etc.<br>
<br>
Did we go ahead and kill it, and would MW push over someone with a raid that is mostly assembled but not quite ready? No. But at what point does that become ludicrious? 1 hour? 2? 6?<br>
<br>
At what point do you tell the cleric with the force ready to kill the dragon, &quot;Ok, I know it's silly, but we're going to sit here and cool our heels while they pretend like they've never been on a vox raid and learned how to buff.&quot; and at what point do you say &quot;Ok, you've got the force, we're still puttering around, go for it&quot;<br>

And we still are. This is what Felis failed to understand and continues to misconstrue, and you've jumped on the bandwagon. I have an issue with the mentality behind the roll and the people that want a list for Rage, and what I think it teaches people. Does that mean I think Lashanna isn't a good cleric? Does it mean that I think Brizzo doesn't &quot;deserve&quot; his epic? No. It means that if I had worked my ass off on a quest like that, something so very cool to my character's personal history...I would have walked if confronted with the little Naggy giant in the cartoon above. A challenge, a battle, a victory, all turned into a mechanical &quot;/rand 0 100&quot;. No thank you.<br>
<br>
Why does this offend so many people, that I can be so anti such a concept, and *still* do the right thing, and yet Felis tromps around this forum tossing around snide morality that anyone who doesn't think like him is a Greedy Soul after Loot, and continually does the wrong things in name of &quot;roleplay&quot;? /boggle<br>

That's just it. Having people there isn't the key. Having a raid capable force IS. Like the Venril Sathir attempt at a rant against MW from a group that spent their entire time spamming our rogues to unlock the door and let them in. Sure...you have a raid capable force, but you can't get into the room to kill the mob you want? How in god's name is that a &quot;raid capable force&quot;?<br>
<br>
And again, I repeat...How long do you tell that cleric who HAS the force to wait?<br>
<br>
I see the roll as a way to ensure the wait could continue without contention, to stall, essentially. Maybe I'm wrong. And I strongly disagreed with it, and probably always will, but I respected it anyway.<br>

Please explain it to me. If Sir Arther of Camelot led an army to slay a dragon, and came upon another army wanting to do the same thing for the glory of THEIR realm, would he have his knights trample them over so that they could slay the dragon first? Or would he ask the other army to join him in the battle to slay the beast, and that they would draw lots on who carried home his head?<br>

If King Arthur and his army came across 6 people claiming they were going to conquer all of France, just as soon as they raised the army, should they have all gone home? Or should they have gone ahead and done what needed to be done?<br>
<br>
Seriously, I'm just looking for a number here. How long is a cleric with the force supposed to wait before it's no longer &quot;Greedy&quot; or &quot;rude&quot; to let their army at it? I'm genuinely curious.<br>

You are quite mistaken in that. There were 2 other clerics who were at the Best of the Best desperately trying to get their porters and friends to leave. One of them was the one trying to offer me some 5k hammer or something if I let him &quot;have&quot; Rage and then, when I politely refused, exclaimed how very much it pissed him off to see a sub 55 cleric with epic.<br>
<br>
The fact that they didn't get there, and I did, however is fact.<br>
<br>
Sure, I lucked out. I'll be the first to admit it. Everyone was distracted by a large event. But most of the people that hate &quot;the race&quot; usually toss up Uberguilds as the reason they hate it, because they can't &quot;beat them in a race&quot;. Excuse me? Have you looked at the schedules these guys keep? You stand probably a 80% chance that if Rage pops, they are in the middle of clearing NToV or some other mobs.<br>

You probably wouldn't like my answer. The epic itself is nothing more than a nice mace with a right click effect that is very very handy. It's value is entirely in the owners hand. Just because other people are willing to settle for a roll, doesn't mean (and I stress again the opening line of this post &quot;If I had been required to roll, I would have walked&quot; not &quot;If I could control Brizzo and Lashanna with Psychic powers I would have made them walk&quot;) that I have to think that it's the best way.

Disagrees with me on what? That it's ludicrious to be kicking your heels in the dirt waiting X* amount of time before it's &quot;ok&quot; for your force that was ready to go X* amount of time before without being deemed evil monsters just because they were prepared?<br>
<br>
*assuming anyone ever answers my above question about how long &quot;waiting&quot; before it's no longer greedy or rude.<br>
<br>
Was it amazingly nice and generous of all involved? Sure. Would I have looked down my nose at you for winning the race if you'd gone that route? No. Tactis, strategy, and efficient planning are something to be celebrated.  Does it change that to me the idea of the roll is completely abhorent? No.<br>

<br>
Again, I think you are wrong. Particularly of MW. We've never passed down the chance to add our forces when we didn't get there first. At least in the time I've been with them. And knowing the others, I doubt it's ever been different.<br>

Again, Adjani, CONCEPT. Not people.<br>

I *hate* the concept of the roll. Not you. Not your raid abilities. Not Lashanna for having her epic today. THE CONCEPT.<br>

Mithril Web hasn't changed at all. The stance isn't new. <br>

Read the post that Keld put in the GL forum (unless it's scrolled since I had access to read). It's all right there.<br>
<br>
Some mobs are considered FFA, and always have been.<br>
<br>
(note: I'm not an officer, so if you want the official stance, you'll have to ask them. But I'm pretty confident that it's not changed that much from the listing I remember reading that Keld wrote up back when I was with ordo)<br>

Again, I don't get it. It should be abundantly clear who has a force capable of taking down the mob. ie, &quot;Ok, you said you had a raid capable force, kill it.&quot; and then either watch them die, or back down, or kill it. But if they attempt to stall further, they aren't *ready* and someone else is, let them take that same test. &quot;Ok, kill it.&quot;<br>

There's really no way to fake being raid capable. You either are or you die.<br>

Felis and I have done this dance many a time on many a post.

I'm a pretty blunt individual. I don't really have any qualms telling someone exactly what I think of them. So trust me, if it had been about this specific incident, you WOULD know.

First, you say this game is to make the average Joe turn into a hero. That is true, this game allows people to create a character who can accomplish some insane feats. Killing a Deity? Slaying some mighty Dragon? We can all do it, if we develop well enough.<br>
However, this at the same time provides a paradox. Since everyone eventually becomes a hero who slays Dragons (well, those that get high enough levels anyway) and such, they inadvertendly become the average Joe again.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But this isn't actually the case. What you are experiencing is that your relative surroundings are ....for lack of a better word for what I am trying to express....full of &quot;equals&quot;. I'm sure Hercules and Samson view themselves as old buds laughing about the time they pulled one too many skeletons and wiped out in Unrest, while the rest of the population views them as at the top and some unattainable place. We all did it. Saw some level 45 run by and thought to ourselves how godly that was and lamented the fact that we would probably never be that uber as the warrior in full crafted with two yaks.<br>
<br>
But every day a percentage of the people DO make it there. While the majority get to their 30s and start other characters, or just plain never break out of a certain level range. There are some ordos that it took over 2 years to get above level 20. <br>
<br>
But because we are surrounded by other people of our level range and general equipment, to us it seems as though we're still that goon that got killed 17 times trying to get his body away from the Nektulos Dark Elf guards (gods that was a miserable day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and I'm sure even InsertHeroHere sat back listening to the bards sing of some great deed and suddenly went &quot;omfg! they are talking about me...I'm not a hero..I'm just some guy!&quot;<br>

In theory, yes, this sounds correct, but let me put it this way.<br>
<br>
Why should the cleric who is prepared and ready to go, be &quot;punished&quot; and the cleric who isn't &quot;Rewarded&quot;? What logic is that? To reduce all that skill, time, effort, and energy to something that rewards anyone regardless of time, effort, and energy. Why bother having your guild coming running at all. Just be in the zone and demand a roll, and then at their own leisure wander in to take him out because you won the /rand 0 100, while the cleric who had prepared for this day, had his friends on high alert, and was there in force, suddenly finds himself SOL, punished for being prepared.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
To roll means that you respect the fact that the others are entitled to their moment of glory just as much as you. And when only one can win that moment of glory, it takes a chance.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I disagree strongly with the entitlement. You are never entitled to glory. You earn it. Again, why is the one who is prepared punished, and the one who isn't rewarded? There is no entitlement as I see it. There is simply who wanted it badly enough to be prepared.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Even so, if you do roll and loose the roll, thereby more or less &quot;officialy&quot; settling who gets his moment of glory, you also win. You win the respect from that other. One day, your turn will come. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but maybe the day after that? Or next week?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Let me give you a prime example.<br>
<br>
When we did another guild cleric's epic, there were 3 clerics in the lair. All three sent out the call. By the time any other guild arrived, and not even raid capable, just arrived, we were almost complete buffing and getting into position for the kill.<br>
<br>
They respected we were there first, and offered to help, recognizing that someone else had been better prepared that time. Had MW ported in and found Adjani's raid capable force, you better believe we would have asked &quot;Need a few more swords and a bit of healing?&quot; There was a race once that I think it was you (?) had posted to the raves forum about 3 guilds racing to Rage, and when they got there, it was clear who was there in force first, and the other two added their numbers.<br>
<br>
There is no disrepect in the race. But I see tons of disrespect in the roll punishing those who are ready and rewarding those who want to stall the process, even if it means losing their chance because they have decided that they know they won't win any other way. (again this is not about a specific incident in any of this, I am speaking in general terms <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  before adjani bites my head off thinking I am talking about her raid :P)<br>
