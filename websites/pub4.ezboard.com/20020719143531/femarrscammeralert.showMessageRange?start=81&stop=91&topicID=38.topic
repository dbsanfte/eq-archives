<br>
I have MANY logs of his crap that I can send anyone if they want em.<br>
<br>
What kind of crap has he done to/near/around me?<br>
<br>
Over the summer I fell for his &quot;its on my other character&quot; scams. This was long before I knew of his reputation or had even heard of him. I had a Wurmslayer and I wanted to trade it for xxx item (i forget now what it was). So he comes and sends me a tell saying he had it on his other char (we all know the way this scam goes), so nievely I did it, and poof he dissappeared with it. So I petition and the Guide tells me to &quot;wait and see if he came back&quot;. Well to make a long story short a guildmember saw him auctionin it in Gfay the next day. So she turned on the ol log and started talking to him. He told her that he had done the quest for it (which was lie, since he was lvl 32 at the time) and now he had better weapons. So it turns out the same Guide I had talked to before was on and I spoke with her and she went to gfay. She stuck around and listened to his auction, then when she sent him a tell he denied to her face that he even had one. Meanwhile I had gotten a TP to gfay and was on my way to his location. Lucky for me Valtron was online, and the guide arranged a special meeting for him to talk to pidnus. Well when valtron got there we all grouped up nice nice and then the heat was on pidnus... he started saying stuff like &quot;my uh... brother plays this account and i dont know what he does&quot; and &quot;I was only auctioning it for my friend&quot; and all types of pitiful excuses to try to save himself. Well after the GMs pulled his teeth he finally admitted it and gave it back.<br>
<br>
I didnt see him for a while after that, and he was on my ignore list.<br>
<br>
When I reached the low-mid 40s I started hunting in sol b. Pidnus happened to be there as well. First day I was there I got lost and had some GKs on me, so I shouted for help. Pidnus shows up behind me, inspects me and watches me fight for a few then runs off and leaves me to die. The next day I was there and LFG and he shows up. I had just installed EQ on friends computer so my ignore list wasnt set up quite yet. He sends me a tell, &quot;Want to duel? I can kick your ass because I have better stuff than you. I have the best stuff for a ranger my level, not YOU. I can beat warriors and monks 3 levels higher than me.&quot; I gave him a solid no, and put him back on my ignore list. Throughout the course of my staying in sol b (and kerryn can confirm this, since he was there around the same time as me) many /oocs and in group talk was about pidnus and his scamming and especially training in sol b. It wasnt really until I was in a bat 2 group with a friend of mine (who was also part of the 'i hate pidnus' club) when he really started to shine. He showed up to the room, stood like he was trying to say something to one of us then ran off. About 15 min later a train of 6 LDCs and other various baddies came through Bat 2 with pid at the forefront and wiped out our entire group. He then LOGGED directly after that, presumeably to avoid and /tells we would send him. The majority of the group /petitioned about him. During my time in sol b, he trained myself one other time, and at least 2 other groups multiple times.<br>
<br>
Now I had just formatted my hard drive and reinstalled EQ, so I had ignores for my most recent encounter with Pidnus:<br>
<br>
I was in EC trying to sell some stuff and I get a tell from someone asking me if I was interested in a woodsman staff, which happened to be a weapon that i have been trying to get my hands on for a long time. So I talk to the person for a few and he invited me into a group. Pidnus is in this group. The first thing out of his mouth when I join the group is, &quot;WHAT THE HELL IS DERRIT DOING HERE&quot;. And I proceed to get bombarded with tells from pidnus tellng me that HE deserved it more than I did because he was better than me and he was a better EQ player and how he was going to need a weapon because a very high profile uber guild (not gonna reveal the name for security purposes) was planning on inviting him and he needed a good weapon if he was going to go on all their dragon raids. I got so fed up with him I logged onto another character and beat the piss out of some orcs for an hour. I log back on Der and pidnus is nowhere to be found, but the seller of the staff was still nearby. He sends me a tell asking me if pidnus was a scammer, and I tell him yes. He proceeds to tell me how pidnus tried to scam him out of his staff (some people never learn), but that he didnt fall for it. We talk for a few and then pidnus logs on. He sees me talking to the seller and then walks up to me. What does he say to me? <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Can we be friends?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WHAT?!! What is his right mind would make him think that anyone would be his friend? bah I dont understand why they let people like him still play I heard from a friend that the guides get multiple petitions about him almost daily. Anyways, I got other little pidnus mini scams and rants from myself and from friends.<br>

Anyway I have heard a lot of the Pidnus stories and witnessed firsthand some of his cockjockey antics. But the best of all was after I posted about him on another board he came up to me in SolB and told me I was an asshole for posting bad things about him and giving him a bad name. I just laughed and said I was only relating the truth. What did he say? &quot;Welcome to Pidnus' ignore list&quot;. Oh God no. I was a broken man..I am on Pidnus' ignore list.

I can tell you all right now that Nubby is NOT, I repeat NOT involved with any scam or anything whatsoever.<br>

I have my main char Purifyre Morticus, I have a ranger Twiglet Valewarden, a druid Nubby Stubbytoes, a warrior Nobby Nimbletoes, and even a cleric named Nibby - I do not know where Pidnus got my name from to use as an alternate name but I do my utmost best to go out of my way to help and assist people with all my chars including Nubby - maybe he felt that my druids name is well-known (I don't know if it is or not) and that you would automatically trust him for using it... Maybe he read it off the sig I used to use - and as you can see from my post count, I am one of the top 4 active posters on this board!  I had nothing to do with that trade - I have to admit a regen bp is a god item IMO and I would love to have one but even after playing for 2 years I am still not in the EQ economic bracket to think about trading for one - maybe someday I'll have one but it will be when I have earned the pp or items to legitimately trade for it.

Naklak - did you petition about that trade and include that he gave Nubby as the name of his alt? if so I am going to petition him for doing this to me...
