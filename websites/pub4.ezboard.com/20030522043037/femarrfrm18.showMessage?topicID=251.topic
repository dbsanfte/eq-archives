Written By: Chuck Noe, NewsMax.com<br>
Thursday, Dec. 6, 2001 <br>
<br>
Bill Clinton ignored repeated opportunities to capture Osama bin Laden and his terrorist allies and is responsible for the spread of terrorism, one of the ex-president’s own top aides charges. <br>
Mansoor Ijaz, who negotiated with Sudan on behalf of Clinton from 1996 to 1998, paints a portrait of a White House plagued by incompetence, focused on appearances rather than action, and heedless of profound threats to national security. <br>
<br>
Ijaz also claims Clinton passed on an opportunity to have Osama bin Laden arrested. <br>
<br>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, hoping to have terrorism sanctions lifted, offered the arrest and extradition of bin Laden and &quot;detailed intelligence data about the global networks constructed by Egypt's Islamic Jihad, Iran's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas,” Ijaz writes in today’s edition of the liberal Los Angeles Times. <br>
<br>
These networks included the two hijackers who piloted jetliners into the World Trade Center. <br>
<br>
But Clinton and National Security Adviser Samuel &quot;Sandy” Berger failed to act. <br>
<br>
”I know because I negotiated more than one of the opportunities,” Ijaz writes. <br>
<br>
”The silence of the Clinton administration in responding to these offers was deafening.&quot; <br>
<br>
Thank Clinton for 'Hydra-like Monster' <br>
<br>
”As an American Muslim and a political supporter of Clinton, I feel now, as I argued with Clinton and Berger then, that their counter-terrorism policies fueled the rise of bin Laden from an ordinary man to a Hydra-like monster,” says Ijaz, chairman of a New York investment company and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. <br>
<br>
Ijaz’s revelations are but the latest to implicate the Clinton administration in the spread of terrorism. Former CIA and State Department official Larry Johnson today also noted the failure of Clinton to do more than talk. <br>
<br>
Among the many others who have pointed out Clinton’s negligence: former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, former Clinton adviser Dick Morris, the late author Barbara Olson, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iraqi expert Laurie Mylroie, the CIA and some of the victims of Sept. 11. <br>
<br>
And the list grows: members of Congress, pundit Charles R. Smith, former Department of Energy official Notra Trulock, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, government counterterrorism experts, the law firm Judicial Watch, New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Bret Schundler, the liberal Boston Globe – and even Clinton himself. <br>
<br>
The Buck Stops Nowhere <br>
<br>
Ijaz's account in the Times reads like a spy novel. Sudan’s Bashir, fearing the rise of bin Laden, sent intelligence officials to the U.S. in February 1996. They offered to arrest bin Laden and extradite him to Saudi Arabia or to keep close watch over him. The Saudis &quot;didn't want their home-grown terrorist back where he might plot to overthrow them.” <br>
<br>
”In May 1996, the Sudanese capitulated to U.S. pressure and asked bin Laden to leave, despite their feeling that he could be monitored better in Sudan than elsewhere.” <br>
<br>
That’s when bin Laden went to Afghanistan, along with &quot;Ayman Zawahiri, considered by the U.S. to be the chief planner of the Sept. 11 attacks; Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who traveled frequently to Germany to obtain electronic equipment for al-Qaeda; Wadih El-Hage, Bin Laden's personal secretary and roving emissary, now serving a life sentence in the U.S. for his role in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya; and Fazul Abdullah Mohammed and Saif Adel, also accused of carrying out the embassy attacks.” <br>
<br>
If these names sound familiar, just check the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists. <br>
<br>
The Clinton administration repeatedly rejected crucial information that Sudan had gathered on these terrorists, Ijaz says. <br>
<br>
In July 2000, just three months before the deadly attack on the destroyer USS Cole in Yemen, Ijaz &quot;brought the White House another plausible offer to deal with bin Laden, by then known to be involved in the embassy bombings. A senior counter-terrorism official from one of the United States' closest Arab allies - an ally whose name I am not free to divulge - approached me with the proposal after telling me he was fed up with the antics and arrogance of U.S. counter-terrorism officials.” <br>
<br>
This offer would have brought bin Laden to that Arab country and eventually to the U.S. All the proposal required of Clinton was that he make a state visit to request extradition. <br>
<br>
&quot;But senior Clinton officials sabotaged the offer, letting it get caught up in internal politics within the ruling family - Clintonian diplomacy at its best.” <br>
<br>
'Purposeful Obfuscation' <br>
<br>
Appearing on Fox News Channel’s &quot;The O’Reilly Factor” on Wednesday night, Ijaz said, &quot;Everything we needed to know about the terrorist networks” was in Sudan. <br>
<br>
Newsman Bill O’Reilly asked how Clinton and Berger reacted to the deals Ijaz brokered to bring bin Laden and company to justice. &quot;Zero. They didn’t respond at all.” <br>
<br>
The Clintonoids won’t get away with denials, he said. &quot;I’ve got the documentation,” including a memorandum to Berger. <br>
<br>
&quot;This was purposeful obfuscation,” he asserted. <br>
<br>
O’Reilly wondered why the White House didn’t want information about the terrorists. Ijaz said that was for the American people to judge, but when pressed he suggested that Clinton might intentionally have allowed the apparently weak bin Laden to rise so he could later make a show of crushing him. <br>
<br>
Concludes Ijaz in the Times: &quot;Clinton's failure to grasp the opportunity to unravel increasingly organized extremists, coupled with Berger's assessments of their potential to directly threaten the U.S., represents one of the most serious foreign policy failures in American history.” <br>

<br>
How do the opinions expressed by an Editor demonstrate that Clinton is a traitor to this country?<br>
<br>
I had read similar editorials of Gearge Bush senior on how he allowed Saddam Husein to gain even more power in Iraq, supplied him with arms and the technology for weapons of mass destruction and helped with intelligence against Iran (of course we sold Saddam arms too!) only to turn around and incompletely kick his arse out of Iraq when we had the chance! Top that off with the idea that Saddam is behind the anthrax mailings sent out in the US. Hmmm... I think we should be more careful with the word "traitor". Seems to me that being the President of the USA is a tenuous position at best. Can't make anybody happy as the President. <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

<br>
"Welcome! <br>
Free Republic is an online gathering place for independent, grass-roots conservatism on the web. We're working to roll back decades of governmental largesse, to root out political fraud and corruption, and to champion causes which further conservatism in America. And we always have fun doing it.

Sounds to me they would be very anxious to "spin" what they could against Clinton or any invidual or group they may consider "liberal". Oh, well. :) <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>

Military Technology Transfers<br>
FOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TARGETS CHINESE NUKES ON AMERICAN CITIES.<br>
<br>
      UNTHINKABLE! A U.S. President accepts campaign contributions from China's Red Army then orders Military Technology Transfers of secret technology to Communist China that he had denied releasing to Australia. N.Y. Times reports that after millions of dollars of illicit Chinese donations had poured into both the Clinton-Gore re-election effort and Mr. Clinton's personal legal defense fund, export restrictions on Military Technology Transfers to China were relaxed by the administration. $100,000 came from Lieutenant Colonel Liu Chaoying, a graduate of Beijing's hi-tech spy Academy and led to more Military Technology Transfers. Clinton apologist Thad Beyle told USA Today regarding Mr. Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair, &quot;It's not as if he sold the Defense Department to the Chinese.&quot; No, it is more accurate to say that he sold the PRESIDENCY to the Red Chinese, and that he has thrown in the Defense Department as a Bonus. One Red China agent commenting on the $366,000 he raised and the resulting Military Technology Transfers: &quot;The White House is like a subway; you have to put in coins to open the gates.&quot; <br>

[h1]China Bribed Clinton[/h1] <br>
TO SELLOUT U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY FOR CAMPAIGN MILLIONS. <br>
<br>
<br>
FREE PREVIEW OF 12 SHOCKING REPORTS, EXTENSIVE PROOF THAT CHINA BRIBED CLINTON. 100 WITNESSES HAVE FLED, INVOKED THE FIFTH OR REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH INVESTIGATORS.<br>
<br>
     Something in each of us does not want to believe that a sitting American President would sell out his country for illegal foreign contributions. But abundant proof from numerous sources proves that China bribed Clinton. This is political dynamite! China bribed Clinton and our children and grandchildren will pay a dear price for this treason the years ahead. China bribed Clinton and enhanced their ability to strike American Cities with nuclear missiles. China threatened to do exactly that to Los Angeles if the U.S. government interfered with Red China's saber-rattling at Taiwan. The Clinton Administration complied. China bribed Clinton through a long rogue's gallery of sordid characters with exotic names: John Huang, Johnny Chung, Yah Lin &quot;Charlie&quot; Price, Mochata and James Riady/Lipzo enterprises, Bernard Schwartz/Loral Corporation, Ng Lapseng, Ted Sioeng, etc. China bribed Clinton in what is now being called Chinagate. <br>
<br>
     Today's headlines will make more sense once have read these 12 intriguing reports. &quot;China bribed Clinton&quot; will be the first earth-shaking story of the new millennium. In 2000 presidential campaign strategies will center on China bribed Clinton and you will already have the inside scoop.<br>

Your statement above lost any credibility you might have had with me as far as providing a valid view point. I am certain you will go to great lengths to find what ever publications necessary to slander Bill Clinton or any other &quot;liberal politician&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, I do not think Bill Clinton was a moral person, but I don't think he was some evil communist who betrayed our country. I find the slander you are pushing outrageous and down right stupid. However, you seem free to be able to publish your rubish so go right on ahead.

Yes it is conservative based but why is that so unordinary?  I'll tell you why, because so much of our media is Liberal based.  I don't think there is anything wrong with freerepublic.com  I think its a refreshing break from the liberal-media norm.  While the two other site provide info on the Clinton controversy, they are obviously intending to detsroy his reputation.  For now I don't believe the American public will know the truth of what happened.  It will probably be many years before we find out what really happened.  Although, I find it comforting that the Bush admin. knows what happened.  Sounds like CLinton was trying to buyout Chinese friendship, while the Chinese were trying to buy 'keys' from politicians that would allow them to enter our technological market.  What the fuck else has changed?  I mean the idiots can't even pass a budget resolution.  Those fukin' crak pipe idiots think its more important to do for their party than do for us.  Because we don't get invloved.  American life is so fast paced that we don't realistically have the time.  How the hell is the americn public suppossed to get involved when political offices are open Monday through Friday at the same hours of operation as 90% of the working public.   Can we recognize simple things?   WE deserve every ass-fuking we get from the politicians cause we are always bent over in our own lives ignoring the huge political cock in our asses'.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulurikeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lurikeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/8/01 11:00:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clinton Unleashed Bin Laden </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The viewpoint was quite valid you just decided at this point to not listen.

I am not &quot;closing my eyes&quot; to this issue and neither am I &quot;spin doctoring&quot;. I would have done the same should idiotioc charges had been brought out against President GW Bush calling him a &quot;fanatical Nazi dictator traitor&quot;.<br>
<br>
BTW, did you or Dunkk know that the microprocessor technology sold to China was allowed by both US House and Senate when the Republicans were the majority. *gasp* They must all be &quot;Communist Traitors&quot;! Did you two also know that USA sold microprocessor technology to the Soviet Union under Ronald Reagan? Ooops, Reagan is a damn Commie, too!<br>
<br>
I suggest, Trech, that I stopped replying to Dunkk because it is obvious to me that he has no idea what he is talking about. He pulls out a couple spins from conservatives and wrongly slanders Bill Clinton. Frankly, Clinton has done enough wrong that Dunkk needn't try to strain a rock for juice! Sorry, Clinton a &quot;commie traitor&quot;? That is laughable. That is like saying Bill Gates is a &quot;commie traitor&quot; because Microsoft has been selling Operating Systems to China since the early 80s!<br>

You will read about AMD, Intel, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Microsoft and a host of other US technological companies wheeling and dealing with China. The CEOs of these corporations must ALL be pinko communists! :lol<br>
<br>
In fact, that pinko Commie CEO Michael Dell is quoted by CNET as saying,<br>
<br>
"We've focused in China on the high end of the market," Dell said in a recent interview. "You'll see us expand that into the consumer market as well." http://technews.netscape.com/news/0-1006-200-6078140.html?tag=bplst<br>
<br>
Holy crap! Dell is selling to the "high end of the Chinese market" which means non-consumer markets such as Aero-space companies, etc.<br>
<br>
Who is allowing all this to happen? Why George W. Bush is! He MUST be a traitor! I am sure he is trying to buy support from major US corporate interests; so allows them to sell our precious microprocessor technology and operating systems to China.<br>
<br>
Of course, while it is true that a shit load of US technological companies are heavily competing in the Chinese market, I certainly don't believe the political drivel that I wrote above. I wrote the above as an example of how ridiculous such statements appear. To be clear, I don't for one moment think George W is a communist traitor because companies like Dell, AMD, Intel, and Microsoft are selling the latest and greatest operating systems, chipsets, and microprocesser technologies to a communist country.<br>

<br>
val·id <br>
Pronunciation: 'va-l&d<br>
Function: adjective<br>
Etymology: Middle French or Medieval Latin; Middle French valide, from Medieval Latin validus, from Latin, strong, from valEre<br>
Date: 1571<br>
1 : having legal efficacy or force; especially : executed with the proper legal authority and formalities <a valid contract><br>
2 a : well-grounded or justifiable : being at once relevant and meaningful <a valid theory> b : logically correct <a valid argument> <valid inference><br>
<br>
I understand why you forgot to include the definition of "valid", because you certainly would have had to admit that you can't provide a "valid viewpoint" claiming Bill Clinton is a communist traitor. /Shrugs<br>
