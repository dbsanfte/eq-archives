His childish tantrums and inability to say anything without the 10 year old insults is quite foolish, but he'd actually have to have some merit or standing to get any where.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately my Whineplay thread is gone, so I can't make you back up your claim that everyone who disagreed with me got under my skin.  Those that attacked me for stating what took place, received a response defending my statements.  Big difference.  Disagreement is one thing.  Attacking is another.<br>
<br>
Not on a soapbox.  Not cyberstalking.  Playing just like always.<br>
<br>
Seeking the confirming, deleted posts from other victims is stalking?  Wow!  You have just as strange a definition of terms as Dwarkarn.  Actually, the fact that I don't have a list of the other victims tends to suggest that making Trayler's life miserable is not that important to me.  The warning alone, is.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid you are so intent on attacking me and supporting your buddy Dwarkarn that you are talking in circles.  1.  Folks posted they got scammed for they hadn't heard of Trayler's antics.  2.  You've inferred that I shouldn't attempt to publicize Trayler's scams (why not just attack the whole premise of a Scammer Board?).  3.  It serves folks right for getting scammed because they should have known better?<br>
<br>
How could they know better if I'm not allowed to post the warning?  No one indicated they'd been scammed by him for a second time.  Now you are just creating ad hominem's to make other victims look foolish.  Bad form.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  Dwarkarn.  Been around this board a lot longer than a week.  Registered in January 2000.  I left this stinking cesspool a while back.  Unfortunately, your flames and the deletion of the other thread brought me back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 840<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/21/01 5:02:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/jerumod.jpg WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=198></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Edited</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It's just funny after you jumped all over other posters for a typo.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

See this is the part about that word you love to use &quot;irony&quot; that you still can't get through your thick head.<br>
<br>
I never flame people for making typos because I suck at spelling myself, on this occasion I let loose about someone's spelling because they couldn't even spell the name of a dictionary right. I don't know why I bother explaining myself to you because it's obvious that you love to use the word &quot;irony&quot; but don't have the mental capacity to grasp the concept of what it means.<br>

As far as the adding paragraphs part goes, I think you should really get off the PCP, your starting to hallucinate badly.<br>

Very interesting comment, but unfortunately for you I can post whatever the fuck I like on here, that's the beauty of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; , it allows me to come here and annoy moronic cyberstalkers like you.<br>
<br>
As far as flaming others in this thread, I never started anything with anyone else in this thread, a few people have jumped in and flamed me and of course I have flamed back.<br>
<br>
The thing I find most hilarious is that you call me &quot;moronic&quot; and my posts &quot;stupid&quot; yet you just can't seem to stop replying can you? <br>

I posted one thread on Whineplay's EMarr forum.  Unfortunately, due to the 10-day limit over there, threads die fast.  I bumped it all of four times in 8 months in order to keep the warning alive.  Not exactly obsessing over it.  As it had been added to by over a dozen other victims, I thought that was important.  Keeping an eye on scammers is also one of my jobs in my guild.  I'm sure you l33t dewds in MC don't need that, but my group of friends appreciates it.  So have lots of others.<br>
<br>
2.  Sure, you didn't ask for my life story.  But, you did attack me for supposedly only joining this forum in the past week.  Hence the refutation of your claim.<br>
<br>
3.  No, as I'm sure thousands of people have informed you outside this board as well, you have no power.  Note that more than one event was listed.  The only reason I came here was to respond to Chuk's idiotic rant (which you identified for me) and to repost this warning due to its deletion elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I'm sure it's fun to be in your little world where folks that have used reason and fact to eviscerate your ramblings are actually crucifying themselves, but you might want to speak to the men in the white coats to increase whatever anti-psychotic you are on.  Your grasp of reality is slipping even further. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 843<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/21/01 5:53:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/jerumod.jpg WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=198></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where to begin?</span><hr size=1> This is getting old, it's obvious your brain struggles to give you the power to do anything other than breathe. <br>

You said your business, now move along, if others have something to add then let them, but to come back on and inform us of what zone he is in, what he is auctioning, what grp he is , etc.. is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Knowing who a scammer is, is a good thing. But to keep us updated like that is showing that you DO follow him around. YOu would have to in order to know what he is doing , etc.<br>
<br>
Your little word games with Dwarken and whomever else belongs in the rants and flames area...I agree, take it there. Hell, I can start a thread for ya if ya want.<br>
<br>
There are scammer posts here that date back to July, should I mercilessly bump them? not an official &quot;BUMP&quot;, but a latest update as to their wherabouts? Their Grp habits? Their auction abilities? NO.. that would be just plain ignorant,unless one of em actually did something to ME. That is what is(well was, anyway) happening with the &quot;dont Trust Trayler&quot; post on whineplay.<br>
<br>
You said it yourself that confirmed the fact of the following him around, when you mentioned that you seen him in KC(from your friends list) and were gonna poke your head inside to warn the others. As far as Trains in Karnors, well, you think the ones in MM or Guk are bad?..geesh(whole nother topic entirely)<br>
<br>
If someone else has something to say, let them. Your response to their reply is not necessary, unless of course he is STILL scamming you or it was a personal flame(once again belongs in the rants and flames). OR if you are really that interested in makin his life a living hell(over 200pp,I might add). And if its the latter..GET A LIFE and GET OVER IT!<br>
<br>
signing off this thread..this is a scammer alert, not a bitch about Raedwolf's obsession with Trayler and 200pp.<br>

Pidnus is infamous on this board and has a huge following of people who will attest to his prowess.<br>
I see 28 posts so far and only 1 instance where he scammed someone.<br>
When i first read the whineplay thread i did see quite a few other posts on there.<br>
most of them were from Phelan (aka Raedwulf) telling anyone and everyone about Trayler.<br>
Some other people DID say they didnt trust Trayler either but hey this was 6 months ago and even a punk like me will say "jeez that was 6 months ago why do i care anymore?"<br>
Maybe the others who posted feel the same way. Maybe it wasnt important enough for them to care after 6 months to post here again.<br>
Maybe you should take the hint Phelan. Like Darue said, your point is duely noted please move on thank you. <p><img src="http://chukzombi.tripod.com/woodzom1.jpg"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uraedwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raedwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/22/01 11:38:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't Trust Trayler</span><hr size=1> Chuk:  It's all well and good to claim I was the only one reporting scams, now that the thread is gone.  You can say whatever you please without any evidence to point out your lies.  The fact is, aside from 4 bumps, I only responded to folks.  My responses were either in response to those thanking me, or defending those who attacked me.  There was criticism that wasn't inflammatory rhetoric, and I left that alone.  The crap you and Beau and Dwarkarn flung around, got a response.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you see a bunch of responses in this thread, but it's all the idiotic rants of you losers, and my defense.  Leave the thread alone.  Frankly, it's so full of your idiotic rants, it's practically useless.  That's too bad.  In the current state of foolishness from you guys, it's unlikely we'll learn of the new predations of this guy.<br>
<br>
Based upon the last noted scam by Trayler in that old thread, before taken over by that moron Vaalik/Beau, the thread would be on the first page here.  Of course, as threads don't die off here the same way they do on Whineplay, there wouldn't be any need for my limited bumps.  It's silly to claim it's not important to those other victims simply because they haven't posted over here.  Maybe they don't know about it.  Over a dozen people added their posts to that thread, yet no one ever posted his name over here.  Maybe that's because this board is so full of the crap you and Dwarkarn keep throwing around, that not too many folks visit.  Just the boisterous and obnoxious.  Yes, I recognize I fall into that category.<br>
<br>
I have absolutely no interest in keeping up this foolish flamewar.  It's boring and I've got lots of better things to do.  Giving myself a root canal without anesthesia sounds like more fun.  I'm just defending myself.  If you guys love ranting so much, I pity you.  It's funny you keep telling me to move along, while you keep attacking.  I've moved on.  I just won't let your foolishness be unchallenged.<br>
<br>
Darue:  Your right, this isn't a scammer alert anymore, because it's been so ruined by the foolishness of Dwarkarn and Chukzombi that have felt the need to bring their rants and flames.  If not for their trash, it'd just be the perennial scammer defender Khockey and my original warning.<br>
<br>
Most of what you said was in error.  I didn't follow him around.  I kept an eye on him for he was following me around.  He ended up in zones I was, I never chased him down.  He trained me twice in OT.  The Karnor's incident was one where I'd seen he was there as I was running through DL to meet friends in FV.  I didn't go in and warn anybody.  As a result, he trained a bunch of folks, several times.  I also kept an eye on him and other scammers for my guild.  I mentioned stories of things I'd seen of him as evidence that my single incident wasn't either a fluke or misunderstanding, and in keeping with what others had said.<br>
<br>
Trains happen.  No shit.  Intentional trains into other groups for the sole purpose of escaping your own idiocy?  That was what another poster stated Trayler did, and he admitted to doing so.  A bit different than MM or Guk, huh?<br>
<br>
I'll repeat this for those that can't understand.  I bumped on whineplay because posts die there after 10 days.  You don't need to bump things here, because they last.  Do I really need to say that again?  Clear enough yet?

Chuk:  Haven't done homework in a dozen years.  Not starting now.  As I already said, I don't recall any of the names of those folks.  Not gonna be able to dredge them up in any fashion.  Why don't you?<br>
<br>
2900+ people?  Yeah, right.  Maybe on the whole stinking board, not EMarr.  Folks that come here more than once in a blue moon: maybe a 100 or so.  Please.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I posted this warning once.  You and that fool Dwark came in here to flame me.  If you hadn't, maybe others would have slowly added some things back in.  I guarantee that if you and he hadn't been flaming in here, this would be a real short thread.  Shows the uselessness of this board in that even a simple statement can be turned into rant fests.  It's only been 8 days since I posted this simple warning.  Doubtful that the others even noticed it was gone from Whineplay.  I doubt the other victims would plow through all the crap you keep flinging in order to repost.  I wouldn't even be here if you and Dwark didn't have this irrational fascination with attacking me over this simple warning.  I wonder when he's gonna admit to being Trayler?  It's the only explanation for his conduct.<br>
<br>
The guy isn't as infamous or constant a scammer as Pidnus or Yilnywen or others.  But, he is a constant pain in the ass in small ways.  It's for that reason I posted the warning in one place, even though I long knew of this forum.  It's too bad you feel the need to rant.<br>
<br>
How about this?  I'll repost the thread.  You and Dwark leave it alone.  I'll leave it alone.  Let's see what happens. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udwarkarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dwarkarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 860<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/23/01 3:56:37 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/jerumod.jpg WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=198></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't Trust Trayler</span><hr size=1> Not the Bunyips Chuck NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! <p><img src="http://users.bigpond.com/raymies/jerunewsig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usurell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Surell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#E9D756>(3/24/01 7:25:36 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.eqdruids.com/c_druid.gif HEIGHT = 200  WIDTH = 100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't Trust Trayler</span><hr size=1> Raedwulf, didnt you say you werent obsessed about this?  ...Then stop talking about something that happened 8 months ago.<br>

In reading another thread regarding the scammer Preed, mention was made of Trayler by Treage.  There's your confirmation, freak.  And that's aside from the more than a dozen in the original thread which you read and which included recent incidents from just before it was deleted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufrittitailchaser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritti Tailchaser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#E9D756>(4/12/01 9:20:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't Trust Trayler</span><hr size=1> And some might recognize this from the movie &quot;Clerks,&quot; delivered so well by everyone's favorite, Randall:<br>
<br>
Doesn't it feel good to be right?<br>
<br>
Raedwolf, you've been vindicated. Trayler is an ass who deserves to be relegated to the 8th Ring of Hell for continually inflicting himself on the rest of the Erollisi Marr server. He will surely have company, in the form of Preed, Pidnus, Mistywolf. Thank you for your dilligence in bringing him to /everyone's/ attention. Again. And again.<br>
<br>
I think it'd be safe to say he's probably as well known as you are, now. You see, in your crusade to bring Trayler to justice for his 50 platinum crime against you (because while he might have done other misdeeds, this is really what it all boils down to - his crimes against you), the rest of the server now realizes that you're a psychotic cyberstalker who can't let things go.<br>
<br>
So thank you for your multiple warnings, Raedwulf. I, for one, have made note of who to avoid in the near and far future.<br>

<br>
I told him I was.<br>
<br>
He thanked me and told me not to worry about it.<br>
<br>
I got back to snaring the mobs cos thats all I was good for and thanked my lucky stars he wasnt gonna jip me outta 50pp.<br>
<br>
Then I destroyed the 500 gold I had accumulated since being down there cos it was weighing me down.<br>
<br>
Actually now that I think about it that was the second time I had seen Trayler recently. The first was a few weeks back when I ducked in to KC to port to EJ. To be honest he seemed reasonably popular as a few people said Hi to him when he said Hi to the zone. More people than say Hi to me at least.<br>
<br>
Maybe the leopard has changed his spots? ;)<br>
