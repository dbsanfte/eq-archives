  This is Maeghant on Air's computer.  The cop statements have already been said, so I got nothing much to add, except I don't think anyone has mentioned that (correct me if I'm wrong) a car is considered a &quot;deadly weapon&quot; in those circumstances.  As in, if you attempt to run someone over, it's attempted murder, just as if you attempt to shoot a gun at someone.<br>
<br>
  Doesn't matter if you are simply trying to shoot at a cop to scare him or try to run around a cop to avoid him.  In that case, the suspect was using deadly force and the cop is allowed to respond.  Cars are taken very seriously.<br>
<br>
  Now, how acceptable that policy is might be subject to discussion.  I don't know how often a car is actually used as a weapon and causes injury as opposed to the number of fatalities caused by firearms, etc etc blah.<br>

Anytime a car is used in an offensive manner or in a way calculated to cause or attempt to cause injury, the act is considered an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, or in some jurisdictions, attempted murder.<br>
<br>
Gun nazis always crack me up.  The officer here used his sidearm to stop someone trying to run him over.  I saw no mention of the guy in the car having a gun.  If this was in England or some other bastion of socialism, the officer would likely have been run over while trying to billy club or scold the driver or whatever peace officers are allowed to do there.  This whole incident shows why arming police officers is not a product of having an armed populace.<br>
<br>
If the driver had been drunk and run over a day care center, people would be ready to hang him by the testicles in the town square.  Yet because he made the same bad choices that a drunk driver makes when getting behind the wheel,  placing the public at risk with his actions, and dies because of it, now he is suddenly a victim?  Sorry, doesn't work for me.<br>

<br>
However, the criminal in this case had split seconds to react just the same as the officer, he made the wrong choice and now he's dead, toting guns around just increases the likelyhood that bad decisions made in the heat of the moment BY EITHER PARTY will lead to a fatality. <br>
<br>
The policeman may well have been totally justified (I wasn't there, neither were you). Funny enough, even if after the dust settles people can say he should have acted differently I'm not gonna blame him for his heat of the moment reaction. <br>
<br>
Trouble is when you react and you're holding a gun people have this unfortunate tendancy to get dead. <br>
<br>
As to the laughable sentance about Billy clubs. A nightstick is not normally an instantly lethal weapon, guns are much more so, what was your point again?<br>

<br>
If the officer in Texas had been armed with only a billy club (as per laws in Britain?) and the suspect had gunned the car (either to drag the officer or crush him against another car) the officer would have most likely died since he would have had no ability to stop the suspect before becoming incapacitated.<br>
<br>
In this case, an armed police officer had a greater chance of surviving the enounter.<br>
<br>
Speaking of dragging a person to death...remember that horrible event in Jasper, TX where the poor guy was dragged?  Abraided the skin to the BONE on his elbows and knees, HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE.<br>
<br>
I think the officer was justified.<br>

Your point was that the officers should be able to neutralise a percieved threat instantly yes? I'm not sure i'd be totally comfortable with the implications of that if i was you. It is of course easy for me to say - i'm not a police officer - but something i think perhaps you're missing is that in the majority of cases a British bobby with a nightstick is gonna be facing a criminal opponent with similar (lower threat) weapons. <br>
<br>
The fact that any drunken loon or assorted nut job could be packing a firearm in the US has to mean harsher procedures are required. <br>
<br>
This last is gonna sound very cold blooded but if a policeman doesn't have a firearm, he'll probably have to attempt to find a less confrontational method of dealing with a situation than sticking a gun in the suspects face, wouldn't you agree? The very act of threatening with a firearm surely increases the chance of panic or irrational behaviour in a suspect doesn't it?<br>
<br>
This possibly puts the officer at increased risk but i wonder if this point doesn't factor into the doctrine....<br>
<br>
I should probably end this post by saying (no matter how i may sound) that I have the greatest respect for anybody who places themselves at risk for the good of their fellow man. Police officers in particular (possibly the most thankless job under the sun).<br>

<br>
 If the officer hadn't had a gun and shooting the idiot in the car wasn't an option, might he have gotten his arm loose anyway? If toteing a gun definately did save the officers life in this particular freak circumstance, what sort of payment in possibly needless deaths are we looking at? <br>
<br>
I just cannot see allowing people to carry around an item that can instantly end anothers life (and we're talking much more likely than a stab with a knife) and by extension having to have your law enforcement be able to meet that threat with equal lethality as a healthy thing.<br>

      I would disagree with you that the suspect had split seconds to react to the situation. From what I read this pursuit was multi-jursdictional and the suspect had PLENTY of time to end it peacfully before those final and fatal moments. He CHOSE not to end it but, rather have it ended for him. <br>
<br>
      As for less than lethal ways of dealing with someone, as I sit here now I have the following on my duty belt. <br>
<br>
1) Glock 21 with 40 rounds of .45 auto, 230 grain Ranger XST's (yea, it's lethal). I would point out that the ammunition is sub-sonic so it has less of a chance of penetrating a wall, door, etc. if a stray shot should be fired in an armed conflict.<br>
<br>
2) Collapsable (sp?) Asp Baton. (can be lethal) <br>
<br>
3) Cannister of OC (pepper mace)<br>
<br>
4) While not carried on my belt I also have good training in pressure points and control tactics.<br>
<br>
I also carry with me a Force Continuum which dictates by policy what level of threat can be met with what level of response. I am sure all other depts have this sort of thing. <br>
<br>
Fact is I carry as much less than lethal equipment as I do lethal equipment. I would also add that the OC is used much more often than the baton and is lower on our force continuum because, barring sever allergies, it has less of a chance to be lethal than the baton does and quite franky more easily incapacitates the suspect. <br>
<br>
As far as firearms and the general public are concerned, I won't argue with you, England does it thier way, America does it ours. Apples and oranges.  I will say that while on the job, I have never had any trouble with a legally armed citizen and I gladly accept the increased risk to my health for the right of Americans to bear arms.<br>

The initial comparison of armed US cops to British cops with billy clubs wasn't mine.<br>
<br>
I would like to see how <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> athetically untangle your arm from a seatbelt before you are 1) dragged to your death 2) crushed.<br>
<br>
I like the fact our police officers are armed, for their own protection and ours.  Sure, there are risks that police officers might incorrectly use excessive force, they are just people who have the potential to make mistakes just like any of us.<br>
<br>
Anytime you think you can do the job better armed just with a billy club, go right ahead.  Walk up to armed crack dealers, step between an abusive husband and his wife, stop a bank robbery.   <p><a href="http://www.saraquael.com/gloriana.html"><img src="http://fyd.fuxored.net/glorymedium.jpg" border="0"></a><p>
