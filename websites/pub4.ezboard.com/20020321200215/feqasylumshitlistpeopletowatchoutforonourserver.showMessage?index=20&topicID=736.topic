Big deal.  That's a very petty thing to shitlist someone for.  She know's her job as an enchanter, I've done aoe groups with her.  We gambled between pulls.  She got a good 200p off me (grins)  <br>
<br>
  To put things like this on the board are petty, if every newb made it to the boards and posted petty things like this not only would the shitlist be full of innane things.  But so would the halls of honour.   I've buffed and saved 100's of bewbie's over the course of 2 years's.  Given gear for free and such.  And yeah I've done a few malicious things too but I don't think it warrant's shitlisting.<br>
<br>
  I read some on the whole arena guild event thing.  The original thread isn't there anymore but through the 3 pages of the shitlist I thought the whole thing was pretty funny.  The only arena guild event's I've had was guildbrawls, that's what the arena is for.  And yes one of the tactices people use is running out of the area when a bunch of people are trying to kill you duh.  you think there going to stand there and die?  Notice how they used tactice?  WOW there actually thinking how dare them!   Instead of whining about it you should have coordinated with your guild and killed them.  You said it yourself a whole crapload of 30's can take down a high level.   <br>
<br>
   They weren't even camping your corpses, they said &quot;we'll let you loot&quot;  well of course there's not mob's in the pvp but there are your dead corpses.  It was aslo in my opinion a stupid shitlist.   The only thing that she did wrong is kill newbies, and you all have to ask yourself &quot;don't we all like to kill newbies?&quot;  I've spent hours on the test server hunting down newb's.  compared to killing some stagnant npc killing someone with a brain is much more thrilling.  <br>
<br>
   So for all you mage's who give newb's modrod's, and for anyone that has ever leved maldan while he was afk, and for anyone who has ever told a newb in ec that kithcore is the best exp around.    no killing newb's should not be shitlistable.  Just as every newbbuffer doesn't deserve to be in the halls of honour.  <br>

I'd back that up with some evidence or at least some names of others who would confirm your story.  As for the &quot;(second account)&quot; assertion, pardon me but how would you know?  How do you know this ninja looter wasn't just someone who glommed onto her and talked her into coming and buffing a naggy raid or something?  How is what he did her fault?  Geeze, I've been present to see some dastardly acts before, but thank the gods nobody was there to blame it all on me with a &quot;guilt-by-association&quot; ruse.  <br>
<br>
So far all we have got are several people I don't know talking bout how they hate her for unspecified reasons, one known person (Simc) who thought she was an ebay or something, and several other strong community supporters vouching for her as a good enchanter and pleasant with which to group.  <br>
In fact, the only charge so far was that she charmed a low level NPC and buffed it, something which is not against any rules, and the NPC killed a level 5 or 6 druid.  Big friggen deal.  FYI the &quot;twink&quot; viral or whatever was just someone who had asked her to PL him and she was bored and decided to help the dude or whatever.   Original poster probably made an ass of himself in a short amount of time, so she left him a parting gift.  <br>

<br>
Obvious why he needs an ebay account to PL his char. Hard to level when your behavior is so anti-social. Too hard to do the work yourself AND be fair with others. <br>
<br>
Stealing a camp from any level char who is willing to share, then getting them killed by buffing the mob with a level 60 chanter you bought is NOT cute. It's not funny. Its assinine behavior. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ulandragoranheronwing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Landragoran Heronwing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/23/02 9:46:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=736.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: enough</span><hr size=1> Ok Tarot.<br>
I read the whole friggen thread.  GAWD the sheer inanity of many of the people on this board just annoys me!  I would cut and paste quotes from the more notable hijackers/flamers but it honestly would be giving them too much publicity.  <br>
Tyral especially seems to have a particular hate for the world and everyone who has better stuff/more levels than him.  <br>
I can't respect that. <br>
<br>
What I did see was a bunch of random noobs logging on and saying Eretyr = Misterte.  Eretyr then logging on and making statements to the contrary, making sure Misterte was punished (delete warrior enough? sheesh), and the scale rolled to the appropriate folks, and then some griefers stalking the thread for months.  <br>
<br>
Every experience I've had with Eretyr in game over the past year has been positive.  She/he is one of the more skilled Phantasmists I know, and always has a nice attitude.  This noob crap has to stop.  <br>
<br>
Tarot, you should have locked and deleted that thread LONG before it finally was forgotten.  Instead it turned into a serious hijacking by a rabid noob ranger.  People had to start making comments like &quot;I like cheese&quot; to end the dam thing.   <br>
<br>
Jellah, I have no idea what you are doing still haunting these boards since you say you no longer play.  Go get on with life or something!  You weren't cut out for EQ.  Not everyone is and that's not a bad thing against you since people have different strengths/interests.  I would advise you to go into social services or something where you can continue your crusade in a constructive manner.  <br>
Oh, silly me, I forgot you hate me over a misunderstanding you've quite ungraciously failed to deal with.  <br>

<br>
I can tell you right now, that's not true. <br>
<br>
I knew the original Eretyr~he was in Inner Fire. I knew when he quit. (Yes, I know it's a female character, but the person who played her was male, so I think of her as him). After that the &quot;new&quot; Eretyr was PLing twinks. Several people Eretyr PLed ended up on the shitlist. Which was why on that thread I asked if it was the original Eretyr, since I knew he had quit...and I also knew he wouldn't act like an asshole like that. /shrug.<br>
<br>
Whether or not the twinks all the new Eretyr or not, dunno. Don't really care. However they haven't had that character for 2 years. Eretyr stopped playing a little less than a year ago. Dunno which verison this one is, but it's not the original. <br>
<br>
Personally I doubt it's a coincidence that people she PLs seem to end up on the shitlist. <br>
<br>
As far as the story of logging into the twink, who was a RL friend, deleting the character for justice, taking the item to give to the person...whatever. It was bullshit. People saw that character later. And last I heard <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>no one</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> had been given the shit from the raid.<br>
<br>
You think she's a good enchanter...super duper. You want to group with them? Fine. Like I said, I don't care. However what happened, did happen. And they were involved. There was also screenshots on that thread that proved Eretyr TOLD people that her alt was that Mistete or however you spell it. Unfortunately they seem to be no longer hosted, but I remember them.<br>
<br>
More than enough information for people to make up their own minds. However it's also been more than enough information for her to remain up here the several times she's been shitlisted.<br>

HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!<br>
<br>
An injenuitive (sic) way to get a spawn to yourself?  that' fucking horseshit.  That's called KS'ing.  Who gives one flying fuck how good of an enchanter s/he is if they're an asshole like that.  The shit list isn't a forum to say who's good or bad at their jobs, but who's an asshole/cheat/KS'er/Intentional Trainer etc...  And it's not petty just because the victim is only level 6.  If it had been some entirely different person KS'ing your spawn in some way, and also getting you killed in the process, you'd  be the first one here writing up what Enchanter_60 with Dire Charm did to you.<br>

I think you will have better luck with number 1. Just a suggestion. I dont HATE you, I dont even know you. I addressed nothing to you....seems you are the one with the issue. I commented on this person who has been shitlisted on 3 separate threads....to me that says there is a problem. But thats ok, as long as someone is nice to you that makes the shitty stuff they do null and void. <p><center><img src="http://www.danos.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/jellah.gif" width="577" height="162"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udobbanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dobbanz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t d00d!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(2/24/02 1:11:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=736.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Eretyr, and her twink viral</span><hr size=1>  Wanderez1 you are an idiot. You actually think that it is amusing to kill &quot;newbies&quot;? That could very easily be considered a violation under the PnP of intentionally causing exp loss. That loser of a chanter intentionally fully buffed an NPC then let charm run out so it would kill that druid thus causing exp loss. <br>
Another thing, it doesnt matter wether you are causing the death of a level 1 or a level 60 its still a shitty thing to do to someone, and if I ever caught somebody having a laugh by causing a level 5 to die I would personally sl them, or at least make sure that the level 5 had this web address to do it themselves. I am tired of how some idiots seem to think, &quot;Oh hes just a newbie so its not as bad as KSing, harrassing, training a high level char.&quot; It IS just as bad, in fact, I think its even worse because it is picking on someone who is totally defenseless and more than likely doesnt even know of the existence of sites like this where a loser like you can be listed. <br>
If some level 60 phantasmist intentionally caused my death now I have a number of options I can follow, I can either report, get help from my guildmates, or leave a nice sl on this message board. What can someone who is new to the game do? Nothing,they probably dont even know about the /petition option yet. I know it took me awhile to figure out how to do that kind of thing. People like you, Wanderez make me sick.<br>

   I've done soo much for soo many newb's in this game and I'm not on the halls of honour.  Higher level's ethics when it come's to newbs and how they treat them isn't a place for the shitlist.  And you can sit your punk 33rd level ass down and shut up about it.   <br>
<br>
  And I don't think the other sl about the arena was worth putting up either, but if the dragon thing went down like it did that's not cool.  But I haven't seen any evidence.  <br>

ROFL!  She did nothing against the rules???  Buffing up a mob with the intention of having it kill another player isn't against the rules?  Sounds a lot like a Chanter equivalent of training by monks.  And I think I&quot;ve seen other posts on this very shit list regarding that fact.<br>
<br>
I wonder how long it takes for you to end up on this board for copying /shrug.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not a level 60 like you, but I have been playing long enough to understand the concept of teamwork, and helping others to enjoy the game, not just myself.  I really don't give a shit how much you help other n00bs out, one incident can ruin all that, as seen many times in this board with people always saying &quot;I never knew him to be like this, always helpful to me, etc..&quot;  I might need to level up to get as high as you in game, but it sounds to me you need to grow up to get to me level in RL<br>

You think that because you have a nice ebayed 60 chanter that that means shit to me? I have news for you child, it doesnt mean jack squat. <br>
 I wasnt attacking you for taking Eretyr's side on this sl, I was attacking you for being an idiot who seems to think that being 60 gives you the right to kill off newbies for kicks. It doesnt, giving nice equipment to a large bat in Misty Thicket isnt the same as hyper buffing that same mob and letting it loose on unsuspecting PCs. That is a serious violation of the rules both official rules and the ones that every honorable and non-ebayed moron follows. You are pathetic and I hope you enjoy your 60 chanter that you probably bought for a couple hundred dollars since I doubt anyone besides those already on this shit list will wish to group with the likes of you. <br>

The question here isn't if she is a competent enchanter.  Several people have stated she is, and I would have no reason to challange that.  The SL is about intentionlly killing somone ( training, causing exp loss, whatever you want to call it ).  <br>
<br>
There is NO excuse for it, none at all ever.  I don't care if they stole your camp, I don't care if they stole your car in RL.  If you are having a problem with them, /petition, if the problems is really bad, go to thier guild, if that doesn't work you can even go as far as coming here ( or Rants and Raves depending on the severity ).  <br>
<br>
NEVER, do you intentionly train someone, no matter what they are doing.  The fact that SEVERAL of her ( or his whatever ) alt's have made the SL it seems pretty obvious to me what kind of person we are dealing with here, and if you don't have the inteligence to figure it out then there is something seriously wrong with you.  <br>
<br>
Anyone who could/would support someone of such low moral character, is someone I would want nothing to do with anyway.  If you truely believe all the stupid things you say you do, we will see you on this list shortly anyway.<br>
<br>
I would highly suggest you stop to reflect on what you are saying.  Think about how you would feel if the roles were reversed and someone intentionlly killed you over something.  I'm not even going to get into who was right or wrong on the first argument, that isn't what this is all about.<br>
<br>
If two people get into an arguement and one pulls out a knife and kills the other, it matters little what the argument was originally about ( or who started it ), one of them is now a murderer.<br>
<br>
Now THINK before you reply.  If you have any brains at all, you know that she ( or he whatever ) broke a MAJOR rule, and by supporting her, you are only a few steps above her on the morality scale.  At the rate you are going now, I won't be at all supprised to see you here yourself one day.  I seriously hope you come to your senses before that happens.<br>

<br>
  Yes I'd say it was immoral, but no I don't think it's against the rule's, she didn't train it on the person.  That person walked up intentionally and attacked the mob.  To me it's no different than gm's playing underconned characters and running around killing newbs en mass.  Exept they put level caps so high level's can't help.  <br>
<br>
  yes it was a mean thing to do but I think it is very trivial as well.  If it was against the rules the person should have petitioned and got a gm involved.  But these are just my view's on the matter.  <br>
<br>
  I don't feel like turning this thread into a continious flame war, but for the record I have a 60 chanter 60 mage 60 monk 56 cleric 55 shadowknight and a 55 druid.  I've been playing for 2 years as well and I've never messed with ebay.  I never have problem's getting groups i'm nice to newb's and I have fun playing the game.   You can go tell all your friends not to group with me and I could really give a shit.  I know soo many people that want me for groups nothing you could ever do could mess up the game for me, why?  Because I'm not an immature prick who learned how to do quotes and likes to flame people for thinking differently than them.  And yes you are a newb, one with a limited vocabulary at that.  I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of even replying to anymore of your flame's on this thread as they are redundant and reflect your horribly low IQ. <br>
