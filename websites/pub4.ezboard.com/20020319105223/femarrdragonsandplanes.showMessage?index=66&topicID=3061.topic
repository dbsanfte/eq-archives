Ever call someone a son of a bitch, or a bastard, or a m0therfucker? Hello kettle."<br>
<br>
<br>
Did I read the wrong comment from Popplo? He did not insult Nire's family. He threatened violence against them. And if this wasnt on a webpage forum but in real life, Popplo would be in some serious trouble. Making bodily threats against someone is illegal.<br>
<br>
"So, how does Midnight Fury properly return such a noble deed? I have a plan. It would be foolish and far too easy to simply kill you. No, in this case, Lady Justice will be satisfied with nothing less than the elimination of all the evil forces that collaborated to bring you into life. I will hunt down your father, slice off the offending dick that spewed forth your clumsy spermself, and then sew up the cunt of the cum receptacle you call "Mom", who would've been well-advised had she chose to swallow that sour load of DNA pudding, instead of allowing it to fester into you.<br>
<br>
Your grandparents, cousins, uncles, children -- all must be eliminated lest we risk allowing the Hacker gene to propagate."<br>
<br>
<br>
These comments looks like threats to me; not just calling someone's mother a bytch or a whore..or even calling his dad a son-of-a-bytch.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Finally, Nirecnad, please go cry and whine somewhere else about the great injustices done to you in a video game. I never had a personal problem with you until you did this. I hear Legends server still has some openings"<br>
<br>
Now on this comment, who is calling the kettle black. There has been alot of people whining because guild information was posted for all to see. I still do not agree with that action; but at the same time, it is still people whining over a video game..Isnt it?<br>

 Yes, we have all sworn and cursed at people, but I wouldnt call you a wanker in front of your grandmother- some things are just inappropriate and what Popplo came out with is symptomatic of a very disturbed mind IMHO. <p><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><HR  SIZE="5" WIDTH="52%"> <STRONG> Isobella Turbokite ™</Strong> <BR> <EM>'If at first you don't succeed, redefine success' </EM> <BR>  <HR  SIZE="5" WIDTH="52%"> <BR> <IMG SRC="http://members.madasafish.com/~egolectric/thundicon.gif" WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufisarik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fisarik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#E9D756>(2/18/02 7:26:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3061.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Actually</span><hr size=1> Nire, I've always had a lot of respect for you, and I still do. But I just lost a lot of it. You've been someone I've always looked up to because you know a lot more than my newbie ass does and you're always there to help me out or give me information. You were always someone who never got pissed off when something shitty happened, but just responded to it in a funny, relaxed way (like Dwarkarn does, sometimes ;b).<br>
<br>
I may not know the full story behind all this (and most likely, I never will), but I know how you feel, because this (guild issue) has happened to me. Four times. It sucks, but its their choice. Theres nothing that can be done about it. I made a stupid mistake, like you did (in my case, taking too long to level and not listening to people who told me don't waste my time sitting in ec... fuck, what a mistake that was). You obviously know this, because you're not a stupid person, but this definately wasn't a good idea.<br>
<br>
Before the shit is thrown any further, if I were you, I'd try to undo what could be undone. Fuck pride, this is a bit more important; its a lot of friends.<br>
<br>
Hope this works out alright.<br>

Nire count me among the friends you've just lost.<br>
<br>
Like Wyvern above, I believe that actions have consequences.<br>
I believe it is a moral obligation to forgive but not forget.  Forgetting is naive and often allows things to repeat themselves.<br>
<br>
When I first caught wind of you I didn't care about the dragon pharming reputation.  I'd heard mixed things, I was a bit confused by it, but I did not hold it against you.<br>
<br>
I thought I did what was right.  I gave you the benefit of the doubt.  Despite your braggart manner and the incessant tells to guild leadership I thought you would be a good fit.<br>
<br>
Now I know I was wrong.  You didn't just strike at a guildtag, or at the circle of people that vetoed you - you just struck at everyone in MF (and many outside) many of which <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> your friends.<br>

First, l have no clue where nire lives, what his real name is or what he looks like.<br>
<br>
Second,If you actually think l would kill someone over a video game your wrong. As l stated the first time nice posted THIS shit on our boards. You can post what i say private or public and l will let you know how much l dislike you.<br>
<br>
Third, You don't like the content of my posts just skip them from now on. But you people who think l'd actually go to his house and kill his family are the same freaks who think rap music is the root of all evil. Find another crusade.<br>
<br>
Fourth, l am an asshole ask anyone who knows me.<br>

Fifth, l havent found that application yet but l know l will. <br>

Odd that I have never seen you post threads about being offended when people said Osama Bin Laden should be shoved up the business end of a camel and castrated, his house (cave?) should be bombed, and all the other colorful and graphic descriptions of what should be done to that guy.<br>
<br>
And as far as hypocrisy goes, I am posting because someone invaded my privacy, and that of my friends, whether it be on an ezboard connected to a video game or the private ezboard for hot-lesbian-pr0n ... err not that I know anything about that.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to Nirecnad's actions, our boards security access was compromised and in the process of dealing with him and the breach, the board security was erroneosly opened up for ANYONE, not just Nirecnad, to read for an extended period of time.  People posted some very serious and *very* private threads that were NOT intended for the public, some about issues in real life that had nothing to do with EQ, and were definitely not for public consumption.  That is a larger issue than making it into a guild in a videogame.   <p>Wyvern Wyrmsong <br>

If Nire's parents had been responsible for the horrendous things that we have seen on 9-11...then I wouldnt have piped up and said anything. But as I will once again say, his parents had nothing to do with what Nire did. Therefore, his parents should not be slandered for it. It doesnt matter who's parents it is, I would say this for anyone.  I was raised with a little respect..and I consider it very disrespectful talking about someone's parents that you will probably never ever ever meet.<br>
<br>
<br>
On a side note:<br>
Yes, I know Popplo is an ass...and his comments should be taken as such in context..<br>
<br>
As for the privacy issue, if you didnt want it seen you shouldnt post it. It sounds harsh; but this is the time for hackers and sneaks..and nothing is safe in this time of technological advancement. It is a shame that not even a person's privacy is considered sacred anymore.<br>
<br>
But then again..it only speaks for the shape of the world these days. <p>~Aamrie~

<br>
Lots of people hold grudges. A few people that did, voted no on Nire. And Nire was upset about that. So to get back at them, he takes some private MF forum stuff and tosses it up on a public forum.<br>
<br>
Not really nice.<br>
<br>
Both Lel and I were pretty head-strong about giving Nire a chance, both in SF and in MF. We even took it upon ourselves to chat directly (and privately) with some of the folks who had a problem with Nire.<br>
<br>
Don't we feel like idiots now.<br>
<br>
Now, Nire, do you really realize what you've done? Let's recap:<br>
<br>
The people who Voted NO on you: you've just proven them RIGHT.<br>
<br>
The people who Voted YES on you: you've just proven them WRONG.<br>
<br>
And worse yet, the people who Voted YES on you: you've pretty much insulted them in the best way you could.<br>
<br>
The sad part is? A VAST MAJORITY of the guild actually LIKED you. I recall the vote, I recall is was relatively close. I recall a HELL of a lot more &quot;Yes&quot; votes than &quot;No&quot; votes. Unfortunately in your case, we do not work on simply majority. <br>
<br>
As for the thread you quoted, well, it's really a case of &quot;apples and oranges&quot;. Comparing your vote to the discussion at hand really doesn't make any sense.<br>
<br>
Oh well... the funny part is, the people who actually supported you (for the most part) are the ones here replying because you made them look bad. And the people who really upset you to begin with? Well, they don't give a shit, and probably won't see this until pointed here by someone else.<br>
<br>
Very unwise, Pally.<br>

You were an ass to me when we were leading pick-up raids and you snaked things from me then, and it appears that your an ass now.  I want to believe that people can change, i guess you werent strong enough and for that im sorry.<br>
<br>
We were never really friends, but I did respect you at times for what you were capable of, not your character mind you, but for your knowledge and leadership skills.  That has changed.<br>
<br>
Things said in private should stay in private for the benefit of all.<br>
<br>
My only lingering question about this is Why? What did you think you were going to gain?  Did you actually think that they would fall all over themselves after finally seeing what your really capable of and invite you into thier family?<br>
<br>
Im sorry for the friends you have dishonored.  Now they have a shadow upon them because of thier connection to you.  How dare you use thier friendship to you as a weapon against them.<br>
