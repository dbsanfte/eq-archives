<br>
Have fun reading it, it rings true for me, since the day I started playing this game, nearly two years ago, and before that with my improv D&amp;D. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *The following was not written by me*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;<br>
<br>
Let me preface this by saying I do not have a point. After reading hundreds of threads regarding tons of topics I decided to get up on a soapbox and speak. It may be humorous, it may be insiteful, it may be critical. To be honest I don't know what it is going to be because I haven't written it yet  <br>
<br>
I love Everquest. When I was 14 or 15 I discovered fantasy through books like the Hobbit and the Trilogy. I discovered it through games like Dungeons and Dragons. I discovered that I loved the world of Dwarves and Elves, Dragons and Wizards. While crammed into a friends bedroom with 5 others, rolling funky dice and imagining doing something amazing like casting a spell I would visualize how incredible it would be to actually stand with my friends and confront a dragon or discover an amazing treasure. In Everquest I have done just that. I faced the Dragon Fear, I faced the breath weapons, I watched comrades fall to their death and I watched those of us that survived kill the beast and reap the rewards. Thank you for that Verant. <br>
<br>
I remember getting this game and standing in awe outside the gate of West Freeport watching people running to and fro. I remember the first time I saw the stone bridge in the Karanas, or the windmills in Steamfront, I remember the first time I laid eyes on Felewith and Kaladim and remember how incredible it was to explore this world and to see so many wonderous things. Thank You Verant. <br>
<br>
I remember someone telling me that the griffon over there, something that until now I had only seen in pictures or in my own mind, would not attack me if I did not attack it. I remember standing amazed as I watched it fly towards me and not believing that we had reached a point in gaming that I could actually watch a griffon fly over me. I remember it attacking me and killing me in .00001 seconds. Thank you Verant. <br>
<br>
It saddens me to see so many people talk about balance, nerfs, epics, censorships and so on and so on and so on. I am just amazed that I can actually cast a fireball at a skeleton. I am just as amazed by it now as I was 2 years ago when I started playing the game. <br>
<br>
I have 2500 hundred hours of my life wrapped up in this character. I have leveled 4-5 times in a week (post 40's) and I have spent 3 months at one level (30th). Both situations were acceptable because I was able to play, I was able to cast, I was able to be an actual wizard. I wish people would quit posting about everything that this game doesn't have and look and appreciate at all that it does. I don't know how anyone can not be just as amazed as I am. As I said I have 2500 hours in on this toon. No video game EVER has grabbed that much of my attention, or been that big of a part of my life. Not to date myself to much but I remember the day Pac Man came out in the arcades so I can say I have seen a lot of games through the years. <br>
<br>
Speaking of being part of my life. My first day playing the game I met Tracy and Dan, these are their real names not their toons. Why is that signifigant? Because I have seen them through their dating, wedding, pregnancy and childbirth. These are REAL people that have had a profound impact on my REAL LIFE because I was fortunate enough to meet them playing this &quot;game&quot;. Tracy has seen me through several dating woes and I was ecstatic to finally tell her I had found the one. I have met hundreds of people that have made me laugh, pissed me off, shown me meanings of words like honor, friendship, loyalty, and generosity. My life has been enriched because of these people and this interaction. Thank you Verant. <br>
<br>
I was impressed when I saw Freeport 2 years ago, I was impressed when I saw ToV last week. Take time to step back and really think about this game and what you have gotten out of it. I know some people are negative by nature, they cannot see the good in anything no matter what. I cannot relate, I try to see good in everything. Coincidently I am constantly told what a happy person I seem to be. I only get one life, why wouldn't I try to be happy? Hmmm maybe it isn't coincidence. <br>
<br>
If you are still reading at this point I am truly amazed. <br>
<br>
To Graffe: You have given me a place to meet people that share 2 of my obsessions, Everquest and Wizards. I have found this to be one of the most enjoyable places on the internet to visit. Not EQ sites, not gaming sites, the who friggin net. Your site has stood out as a place of debate, thought, comraderie, laughter and friendship. Thank you for all that you and your moderators do. I know you must have a tough job to maintain something so spectacular as a &quot;hobby&quot; I hope that knowing how much it means to some of us out here makes it worth it. <br>
<br>
To the people that hate EQ: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (This is a cool pic of a smiley face flicking people off, but I can't seem to post it here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
To the rest of you: This is one mans ramblings, respond or don't. Flame or applaud. Think or don't. I just wanted to stand and speak, I think my 5 minutes is up. <br>
<br>
Remember when the K3\/\/l d00D5 tell you &quot;Ju Su&gt;&lt;oR&quot; tell them what I always say. &quot;I like bunnies, do you?&quot;<br>

You don't have to look at the other person/people you're playing with.  Anonymity brings forth the worst in people.  It gives them the false sense that they can do what they want when and to whomever they want.    <br>
<br>
It’s like George Carlin said many moons ago, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> how big an a$$hole someone is, is directly proportionate how close that person is to you.  If they are right next to you they are (barely audible) an a$$hole, if they are in another vehicle traveling down the highway then they are (shouting loudly) an A$$HOLE.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>

I loved the “old days” when dice meant the difference between life and death; and where friendships were formed over sheets of paper.  May the “good old days” live long in our minds and each of us never forget where we came from.<br>

It's great to see Verant has made something that has given this guy so fulfilling.  <br>
<br>
His post however, while written romantically, seems overtly obsessive to me.  Unnaturally obsessive.  And that's scary...you see people this much engrossed in _anything else_ and you call them a freak or you see them on the 6 o'clock news proving why society came up with restraining orders.  <br>

<br>
Kudos to you my friend.  I know EQ will never be the &quot;roleplay&quot; game that it has the potential to be but when you look at it from the perspective of the little characters walking around in Norath things become much more enjoyable.  (EQ is not DiabloII, there is more to it than just a high score--if you look around)<br>
<br>
In the early days I started playing with some of my RL friends (who I also DnD'd with) and we decided to play Barbarians!  Sometimes we still laugh about those first exciting episodes... Ice Giant!! ::running as fast as our little 9th lvl sow'd legs would take us, and I hadn't even seen the thing!:: ; Barbarians in Kerra Isle?  Cool, I've never grouped with a Barbarian before. ; Aargh I can't fit in the bank you cursed Tree Dwellers.  Thankfully Dwarf Bloodforge has gifted me with a mighty hammer and his kin are more welcoming to the large folk.<br>
<br>
I made it to 17th level with my Barb Shaman (must've taken many month) but I felt the mighty power of a 75pt DD spell in my hands. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I travelled, explored, quested, and marveled at the certain death and rich rewards waiting around the corner (that Bloodforge Hammer kicked butt in its day!)  <br>
<br>
Verant and Sony have broken this genre of video gaming wide open and that is why EQ has been so successful.  You're right, many times we focus on what the game has not, instead of what it has.  I've been playing for close to two years and haven't found a replacement game yet.<br>
