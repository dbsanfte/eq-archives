Hehe. <br>
    This whole event was a spur of the moment thing, Like countt said, in which EVERYONE in the zone seemed to say something with a &quot;Bad&quot; word in it. We WERE the only 2 that got summoned for a whole zone doing it but I found it hilarious how everyone broke lose for just those five minutes and released all that energy that amounts from being nice in this game. You all know you have some hehe. <br>
    Also, why do people complain so much when they hear a cuss word? This game is rated TEEN, not PRESCHOOL. I can agree the entire zone cussing can get someone's knickers in a bunch but when someone says &quot;Damn&quot; why the hell should you start crying and petition? Like was said last night, EVEN THE NPC'S SAY DAMN  (A madman &quot;Damn my eyes, you're just another illusion!&quot;) So I'm not saying anyone here does it but there are quite a few people who whine like babies because I guess they forgot to turn their FILTER on. But anyway, I still find this entire OS thing hilarious and I was laughing my ass off through the entire thing in OS. Some of the things people said were PRETTY funny lmao<br>

<br>
I have spent most of my RL career doing support for tech companies. When I worked at Dell I was a Major Accounts technician who had to deal with some of Dell's biggest customers. Taking that into account, you definitely DON'T have to take a few bad words or deal with people who act like an ass. Stupid yes, jerk no. Had you acted in a similiar manner in real life I would have given you my extension, told you that you were being disconnected, and that you could definitely call me back directly when you were ready to work with me to solve whatever problem you called about. Just because someone is in customer service/support does not mean that they get paid to deal with asses. Guides don't even get paid unless you count your EQ service each month being free. <br>
<br>
You can rationalize it however you want, it still comes down to being civilized about it or being a jerk. Unfortunately it seems when a guide or GM gets involved with anything it tends to cause the jerk switch to flip over to ON.<br>

We are taking down the servers on this date for seven hours after a happening in Sebilis the other day to make a minor update to the language filter and chat program of Everquest.  Now if you say anything that relates to swearing, cussing, or anything harsh you will automatically be reported to out customer service and GMs.  In addition we are also updating the language filter to block the latest of players' slang swear words like &quot;sheet&quot;(shit), &quot;foockin&quot;(fucking), etc.  We apologize for the inconvenience and hope this improves your gaming experience.<br>

We were well within our rights to terminate a call at Dell if a customer was being abusive. However, Dell tended to be a bit more heavy handed with outsource reps. <br>
<br>
As far as your comments, you could have just kept your mouth shut, yet you chose to ask why the guide was being anal. This is not really a problem beyond the simple fact that you were taking a confrontational stance, not really the best position to take in such a situation. Had you handled it in a different manner or not replied it is quite likely you would not have been summoned for further discussion. Being polite goes a long way towards making people pay attention to what you are saying.<br>
<br>
That being said, I don't intend to respond further. I don't agree with what those involved did, but then I am not your keeper and therefore you are entitled to do what you will. I just don't have to agree with it, hence my comments. <p><small><br><br><br>Stupidity cannot be cured with money, or through education, or by legislation.

Im sorry Celdor, but I tried reading the screenshots and found no mention of Countt or Ruler asking why the guide was being anal. All I found was Countt asking if the word anal was a 'swear' word. I cant find anything else, can you point that out to me.<br>

Really, even though that GM is probably some sort of poor overstressed Verant drone, who, sometimes makes the butt of a good joke, what did you accomplish here?<br>
<br>
Ruler, all due respect to Countt, YOU are quite the buffoon.  You are also a net.weiner.  Could you possibly type &quot;hehe&quot; and &quot;lmao&quot; more?  Maybe put another ten thousand smileys in what you write?  Much as I hate to rain on the parade of any kind of rebellion, I feel that it would be better if you went back to the zombie like force of those who demand &quot;what happened to all the roleplaying?&quot;<br>

WOW you have even less of a life than I do, you win! And bodie - you're going to make me cry! OMG I'm such a nolife I have to put a few Lol's and Lmao's in a post. I guess I better go kill myself now for thinking something is funny. Ever think it's because I'm use to typing them? I've played counterstrike for over almost 2 years and some of the things there are pretty fucking funny as where I started laughing at things. So stop critiquing*sp* the way I talk and go back to your damn Star Wars boardgames. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uruler2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ruler2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/30/01 6:00:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pank </span><hr size=1> I still don't think it's funny =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uruler2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ruler2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/30/01 6:05:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cmon</span><hr size=1> Cmon guys this IS the rants and flames section...Let's get some real flaming going besides &quot;You type like a wiener!&quot; and &quot;I played EQ longer than you&quot;...You can start by bitching @ me for my 3 posts in a row...I forgot what I was gonna say<br>

It wasn't in the screenshots. Just as an FYI. No other comment. <p><small><br><br><br>Stupidity cannot be cured with money, or through education, or by legislation.
