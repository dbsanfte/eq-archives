I think a deeper question is why you believe there is a supreme being?  I think the answer to this question rarely has to do with logic or evidence and more with a desire for some kind of purpose to life.<br>

I am not sure where this comes from.  From what I have seen (not necessarily from the postings to this board) people have shown a lot of logic and intellectual development in dealing with God's existance.  You can't disprove all cases of god, just ones in which specific claims violate certain assumptions.  So someone can tell me there is a god and say nothing else about him.  I cannot ever hope to disprove that.  I can not speak for other people or what you have seen so far, but my experience has been different.<br>

When something is not seen or observable, it is just a conjecture.  You can build upon your conjecture and make claims.  If your claims prove to be true, then your conjecture is taken more seriously.   So with spontaneous generation, the claims turned out false and with atoms they turned out to be true.  But ultimately the knowledge comes from experimentation and observation.  Belief may lead you to try things, but it is not scientific knowledge unless it has been verified over and over until people feel it has truth.<br>

I am not quite sure what has been going for a few hundred years?  Religion is a few thousand years.  So are thoughts on religion.  Are you talking about some knind of recent understandings?<br>

I am not trying to degrade feelings, but they should be recognized as just feelings and not facts.  I have heard some people say that there must be a god that is good because life would a waste without one.  That was their feeling, but they take it as fact.<br>

I do not see where you show my ignorance.  I grew up in a Christian family with everyone around me Christian.  My initial disbelief in God came through independent thinking.  I have learned of other belief systems and thinking patterns.  In addition, I see nothing wrong with &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; and borrowing other people's beliefs and ideas.  This has been something I have investigated quite a bit.<br>
<br>
I am not sure what set you off on my post to have such negative view on it.  From my observations, I find that people usually believe in God based mostly on feelings (with scattered observations that usually do not hold up logically.)  In my mind this makes all religions equal since one person's emotions can not be more or less valid than another's emotions (except my own).<br>
<br>
So if you believe in God and it is based on a feeling or desire, then fine.  However, it is much more interesting if people do believe in God based on things other than this.  And I believe this would be interesting to talk about.<br>

Your right I was a little too harsh towards the end. I'm sorry Quath.  I guess I just get frustrated when I see people use the similar logic to disprove God as the people trying to prove him.  When they try to disprove him they say how stupid they are for believing in God.   Makes no sense.  Like I said though, I'm sorry for being too harsh, it was wrong of me.  <br>

The Greek philosopher you're looking for was named Democritus. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
More of an aside than on topic, but I thought it was interesting.  Democritus along with another Greek philosopher, Leucippus, believed in the atomic basis of matter.  This was about 500 BC.  Even Newton believed in atoms.<br>
<br>
However at the turn of the century around 1900, it was still hotly debated.  That surprised me.  They had some good theories that worked well with atoms, but some scientists would just say that matter can clump together.  <br>
<br>
The biggest reason against atomic theory was thermodynamics.  If you had a cylinder of air and compressed it and released it, you were not back at the same state.  So some scientists believed if matter were atoms, then such a cycle should be reversible.  It was Einstein's browian motion paper that finally gave a convincing demonstrating that there were atoms.  Only a few die hard physicists would not accept it  (such as Mach).<br>

<br>
—James Madison <br>
<br>
 &quot;As I understand the Christian religion, it was, and is, a revelation. But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed?&quot;  <br>

&quot;I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature.&quot; <br>

—Thomas Jefferson <br>

&quot;It is too late in the day for men of sincerity to pretend they believe in the Platonic mysticisms that three are one, and one is three; and yet that the one is not three, and the three are not one. But this constitutes the craft, the power and the profit of the priests.&quot; <br>

<br>
&quot;What is it the New Testament teaches us? To believe that the Almighty committed debauchery with a woman engaged to be married; and the belief of this debauchery is called faith.&quot; <br>
<br>
—Thomas Paine <br>
<br>
&quot;I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any Church that I know of. My own mind is my own Church. Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all.&quot; <br>

&quot;Ecclesiastical establishments tend to great ignorance and corruption, all of which facilitate the execution of mischievous projects.&quot; <br>

  Deism was a platform for the staunch anti-church/state revisionists.  It does seem to me that the fascination of something is taken away by monotony.  (refering to the religious finger-pointers)<br>

Btw, speaking of Thomas Jefferson, whom yes, was great at many things indeed...<br>

You do know he spoke about all men being equal and free, but then he never freed his own slaves?  He also had an affair and children with one of his slaves ( possibly named Sally Hemmings I believe?), but he never set her free either. <br>
