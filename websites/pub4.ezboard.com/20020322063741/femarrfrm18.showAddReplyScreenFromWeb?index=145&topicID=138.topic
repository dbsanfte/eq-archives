&quot;Someone once told me that discussing religion was pointless. You either have faith or you do not, and one side can never see the other.&quot;<br>
<br>
/Agree<br>
<br>
Faith is partial, it is a personal preference. Arguing that one's personal preference is true while another's is false is an exercise in futility at best. Faith in and of itself is not about truth. Everyone of us like to think our beliefs or opinions are grounded in &quot;truth&quot; otherwise they would not be worth holding. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Problems arise when we present the grounds for faith as factual but do not express the basis of our faith. &quot;I believe in yellow colored pixies flying around Big Ben at Midnight each night&quot; may be meaningful to the one expressing the sentence, but those who read or hear the sentence may not be very appreciative. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Saying that the &quot;Holy writ of Barney tells me so&quot; doesn't help much either, both the rationalist and empiricist will want some less circular explanation in order to make sense of the fomer statement. For those about to say that belief in god cannot be compared to belief in pixies... I am using a crude example to make my point. If faith is a matter of rational assent that logical explanation can only go so far, then there can be no cogent argument against the premises of one's faith because presumably faith can't be quantified in a logic. Supposedly, it transcends reason. As an atheist I respect the idea of faith and only ask the believer to have the same respect of faith, too. Too many believers like to present faith as quantifiable... if it were then it wouldn't be &quot;faith&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utrechdashadowknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trech Da ShadowKnight</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 295<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/18/01 5:42:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=138.topic&index=155>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do you believe in god?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If god exist, as that theory cannot be proven or disproved, then I must assume that he would not care weather you worshiped him or not.

If God does exist and he is a being that is timeless and capable of creating all that is then why would you try to characterize what he does in petty human terms?<br>

And Triff..you say that something that can't be proved can't be belived in..ahh well then I think you missed my post earlier about my son.  Please re-read it..that was all the proof I needed.  You can try to debunk it simply because you have to, because to accept it would mean it was in direct opposition to everything you stood for..and that is your belief that the individual is the ultimate goal and you are the end to all means.

For example, I believe it is wrong to steal, kill, etc, but I can't prove it. I can use a different word to &quot;wrong&quot;, such as &quot;detrimental to humanity as a whole&quot;, and come up with reasonable arguments. But I can't prove that actions detrimental to humanity are wrong, without invoking theological arguments, which is rather hard as an atheist. So these beliefs do not have a logical basis. However, I think you'ld have just as hard a time proving that they act contrary to some form of logic. If you define &quot;illogical&quot; as &quot;without logic&quot; then I'll accept that my beliefs are illogical. If on the other hand you define &quot;illogical&quot; as &quot;counter to logic&quot; then I don't think they are, and nor are the beliefs of those of most religious faiths.<br>
<br>
A belief in God is something which does not require proof. I don't have that faith, but I don't deny that others do. On the other hand, I have yet to see (and don't believe I ever will see) anything resembling a proof that God (as most people define him/her/it) exists. The most common arguements I see involve biblical quotes, which can't be seen as a proof if you don't believe that it God exists for the Bible to be the word of. Bootstrapping like that ain't going to work.<br>
<br>
Poppen's story is moving, and I don't have an explanation, but I don't see it as proof of an intelligent, benevolent deity. Static apnea (underwater breath holding) records are only around 6 and a half minutes, and these are adults who train for it. But they don't go so far as to fall into a coma. To me this shows that there's a lot of things we don't understand yet. There's lots of room in the realm of &quot;what we don't understand&quot;, and a deity could fit there, but I don't see it being required.<br>
<br>
Then we get to arguments about creation of the universe, or existance of life/man/etc.<br>
&gt;  Even science agrees that the universe has not always been here<br>
Not really. Many (most?) cosmologists would argue that the laws of physics, which include the concept of time, were formed with the big bang. As such there isn't a &quot;time&quot; &quot;before&quot; it. As you get closer to the actual event, the concept of time becomes not too well defined.<br>
<br>
One theory I read somewhere that kind of appealed to me. Quantum fluctuations allow the creation of matter from nothing given certain boundary conditions on the duration of the time the matter exists, and it's actual mass/energy (product of the two is less than hbar if my memory of 3rd/4th year uni physics is not as rusty as I think it is). Now it looks to me like you need to allow &quot;negative enery/mass&quot; to get this to work (which wouldn't be the same as antimatter), but if the mass is small enough, you can have a universe that exist for a long period of time, being spontaneously created from vacuum... further surfing lead me to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://hbar.stanford.edu/linde/">Andrei Linde's webpage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. A physics proffesor at Stanford, who as several papers and links regarding &quot;self-reproducing inflationary universe&quot; theories, which seems to be what I'm talking about, except he mentions fractals, which of course makes it infinately cooler <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I'll have to read those papers at some stage.<br>
<br>
Can life be spontaneously created? Its not hard to show that amino acids can be produced &quot;naturally&quot;, and I'd say you've really got to clutch at straws to come up with anything resembling hard probability of creating simple self-replicating molecules from there. That's to give either a high or low probability. It's another of those &quot;we just don't know enough&quot; things. First question: How many planets have the required amino acids on them, and for how long do we run the &quot;experiment&quot; to create life.<br>
<br>
In the end, I can always invoke the anthropic principle to justify the odds of the existence of life, our biodiversity, and complexity, no matter how long the odds.<br>
<br>
Lastly, being correct about something (existance of God, evolution, the theory that a high velocity piece of lead isn't a healthy thing to introduce to a human body), doesn't prevent one causing attoricities, wars, whatever. The existance or non-existance of God has no real bearing on religious wars. That has more to do with the church. And Largar, were you aware that Samuel Verner, who brought Ota Benga to the US to display in the zoo, was a Christian missionary? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#E9D756>- </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/bemarr>Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love</a><font color=#E9D756> - </font><a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18>America Under Attack</a> <font color=#E9D756> - </font> <br>
