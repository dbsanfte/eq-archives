Let's face it, if i am doing something in my free time that causes me grief, why would I continue to do it?  <br>
<br>
That being said, I have read a couple times throughout history (have been on this server for a year and a half now) about power players, FFA mobs, i'm more UBER than you, you can't kill this mob but we can, etc..  We all know where those conversations come from, and why they spring.  <br>
<br>
I must say, as i am sure it has been said a million times before...who really gives a shit?  What does being UBER in this game accomplish?  Why would you step on the toes of other people attempting to enjoy an online community to accomplish your own personal goals?  So you got a heiro cloak.  Great. So you hit level 60 Great.  So you can take down Cazic with only one group.  Fucking great.  What does this prove?  This proves that you spend too much time in front of a computer screen to &quot;dominate&quot; an imaginary online world that will evaporate within a year, angering others in it in the process.  Then you will be left with your monitor, keyboard, mouse, and dick in your hand beating off over your velious quest loot with a hundred other people online, while everyone else moves off to a game with better graphics.  Good job.<br>
<br>
Now, there is a whole online community, many of which i have the honor to call online friends, who play this game for fun.  They achieve goals in game, work with their friends to further accomplishments, help strangers along the way, and in that find personal success as well as online gratification and a solid reputation.  These people also achieve level sixty, albeit sometimes slower.  These people also get epic weapons, albeit slower.  But they are real people, who revel in the fact that they can &quot;exist&quot; in an online fantasy place created for us.  It is these people that i salute (and there are far more of this kind than the former on our server IMO).<br>
<br>
To summarize, don't be a dick, it's a game, and an online community. Enjoy it, as well as the people that surround you.<br>
<br>
This is probably the only rant you will ever see from this tree hugger.  My apologies for beating a dead wolf. :-)<br>

<br>
[rant on]<br>
<br>
Here I am just a lowly 6th lvl cleric, trying to group with 4 other casters(enchanter, necro, druid, bard) in WC, and not doing too badly, just being very picky about our targets. We see a hanging young kodiak spawn and thinking &quot;bingo, we can handle 2&quot;. well did we get hosed when 4 of em popped off that spot. needless to say dead were 3 of us. <br>
<br>
Here I am again running out of Wfprt after my corpse( not begging for a sow because I know how begging sucks, prefer to do things on my own and not bother people) knowing this will take a couple of minutes. I zone into EC and the first thing I see is this Dwarven Druid about 12 feet in the air headed my way. I briefly thought to myself &quot;wouldnt it be great if we could all do that&quot; and then I saw the lion training after him and too damn close for my liking. 6th lvl clerics and Lions dont mix well. especially when I'm the cleric, not the lion. <br>
<br>
I tried to shout out to my 2 other groupers who were close behind me in the freeport zone to watch it, big teeth and claws at the zone marker but I was too late. needless to say one of them became a kitty treat and had to pop back in.<br>
<br>
[main part of rant] <br>
<br>
What the hell do you evil, conniving, immature, spoiled, gutless in real life assholes get out of training big ass carnivores on beginning players?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>
<br>
Is it because you didnt get enough love as a baby? or maybe you were the redheaded stepchild who had to eat liver and onions while the other kids got cheeseburgers?<br>
<br>
(i know this sounds pretty stupid but man am i pissed about this)<br>

knock the shit off you morons, everyone hates the shithead in school who always mouthed off to others just enough to get his ass kicked and then not be smart enough to know that he should shut up instead of continuing the BS.<br>

I think you misunderstand the point of my post.  I never said that the people out there fighting the toughest stuff *always* trounced on everyone else nor do I pretend to be &quot;a saint&quot; as you say.  I, as much as anyone else like killing tough stuff, and I have invested tons of time in this game in real life too.  In fact, i really enjoy seeing screenshots of things in the game that i have never engaged (like the sleeper for instance) and that others ahead of me have.  I appreciate that they share records of those encounters, I benefit from reading about the strategies they develop and teach.      <br>
<br>
The problem that I have is when immature dickheads trounce around Norrath proclaiming god like capabilities when they are just simply playing a game.  My problem begins when power players crap on others to achieve their goals and hide behind the weak ass excuse of &quot;playing style&quot;.  That is my problem, and the source of my rant.  While i do agree it is impossible to please everyone, it is possible to come to an equitable agreement 99% of the time.  Most problems can be eliminated simply by changing the way one approaches them.<br>
<br>
Good hunting.<br>

If I understood you.. some one ran through the zone one way, while you were zoning in the other and they had a Lion chasing them, and because you zoned in just at that moment the Lion than chased you, or your groupmate down?<br>
<br>
I know how frustrating that is believe me.. and I know some people train on purpose.. <br>
<br>
But that just sounds like a &quot;wrong place at the wrong time&quot; kind of thing which has happened to probably all of us at one point or another... I doubt that druid intentionall trained anything.. sometimes (especially when they have sow on) they dont even know stuff is on their tale.  (I run fast as a bard and might have 20 things chasing me down but I wouldnt know it unless I stopped and if I am running far I wont stop)<br>
<br>
Just know that ALL zones are dangerous.  When you zone into any zone be prepared to about face and zone back. (I've been caught between zones before and that isnt fun either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <br>

That very well could be, just an unkown issue which is why i chose not to name that particular character. It does happen and I'm sure it will again in the future.<br>

I could be wrong because I am relatively new but if you are levitating that high (he was pretty well up there) wouldnt you have to actually do something to aggro the animal?  maybe not, but it was just a rant and I hope that i can avoid it again....and again and again and again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/udiirkshade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diirk Shade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(6/25/01 3:03:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Power Players/Server Bullies (longish rant)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Uh, no, guilds take alot more flack that your average joe ever would, simply because they're a bigger target, heh.
