<br>
Ok, we went into Frozen Tower to get a wedding ring for a couple getting married. We only had one group of us. We got to floor 3 in about 2 hours. There, we encountered problems with those shadowed armored people.<br>
<br>
A few jumped us near the mirror entrance from the 2nd floor, but we were ok. Then we headed to the next mirror. 3 more attacked us and it got pretty bad. 3 of our group went down and the cleric, Baldin (warrior), and I were left getting attacked. Now, I know because they all told me this and I trust Baledin that the cleric said she was gunna camp then come back and rez us all. I didn't see this message because the spam coming from the 3 mobs hitting baledin and myself. I ran to her not knowing that she was camping trying to get a heal so that I wouldn't die. Then, I ran back the other way and gated luckily while one of the things were attacking me. When I had ran to her, they said that I trained one on her and she died along with the warrior not long after I gated.<br>
<br>
I gated to Freeport and walked to EC to see what was going on because we heard about a supposed event there. There wasn't one, but the lag was horrible. Now, it was time to go back and get corpses. They were getting help from some other people and asked to have one person to disband. I disbanded and then went LD from the bad lag in EC. I tried to log back into EQ for about 15min, but it wasn't working, so I gave up. They all think that I camped because I didn't want to help clean up the corpses, but if you know me, I wouldn't do that; come on.<br>
<br>
That's what really happened. I'm really not an evil guy.<br>

I don't think that Knobb is a bad person, I just think he hasn't experienced the higher level group fighting enough to understand how wrong he was.  I assume responsibility for a bad pull.  I got lost looking for the second mirror.  I was five seconds from camping when Knobb trained four of the creatures on me.  I had told them I was out of mana and I needed to camp to be able to get us back by rezzing everyone.  The person carrying the keys was the second in the group to die.  Needless to say I thought we all had died.  The corpse run took 3 1/2 hours and some begging by myself of a friend to help me get into the tower.  I did not realize that Knobb had gated until I was in the tower waiting for someone to drag his corpse.  I could not find it in the hall.  I was mad then.... no, mad doesn't even begin to describe the rage I felt.  If He had paid attention he would have realized that the person being asked to leave the group was my EQ husband who was in the group so that we could continue to keep the group together.  The bottom line of this entire fiasco is that it wasn't just one person's fault that it went bad.  It was my fault for a bad pull, and Knobb's fault for not paying attention to his screen.  It goes to show that communication is essential during a high level raid and the cleric needs to camp out when they say so....   I just wanted to give my 2cp about the situation.  I truly don't think you are a bad guy Knobb.<br>
