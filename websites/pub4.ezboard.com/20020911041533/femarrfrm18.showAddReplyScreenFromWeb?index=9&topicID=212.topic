Now, i'll just say a few somethings:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Any female in a Taliban-controlled country who claimed to be or have been a male would probably be stoned before she convinced anyone of anything. I'm perfectly serious. You know that under the Taliban's laws, a woman's brothers and father have the right to beat her to death if she is raped, while the rapist walks free?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I really have no idea where you got that from. I guess it is some TV/news paper reporter, or someone who wrote some book, but I can guarantee you that this has nothing to do with islam ( which taliban says they use ). I can't verify what taliban does/did, but i really cannot swallow a single word of the above.<br>
<br>
In Islam, the raped woman is totally innocent, and is untouched, let alone stoned.  She is also allowed to keep her child and raise him/her as her own. Those brothers/fathers/etc are actually obligated to give her all the money she requires for a decent life for herself and her child ( any income she has is irrevelant, they still have to pay, and she keeps all her work results).<br>
<br>
The rapist, however, is killed. Excuted, has his head cut off ( if proven guilty, of course). No compromise, no i am sorry, no i won't do it again. You wrecked someone's life, you pay. The excecution punishment is given to a very limited number of crimes in islam ( intentional killing, rape, armed robbery and assualt, and a few others).<br>
<br>
Please make sure you verify what you say before you state such a thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think they castrate men over there and call 'em Eunuchs<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I don't know where 'overthere' is ( pretty sure it is not the place with howling stones) , but i  assure you it is not that way in the place that you're thinking of. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Bush may be right, this war won't be over when Bin Laden is caught or killed, probably have to round up more after him before the bird goes home. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wrong, the more 'terrorists' who are killed ( and as i can see on tv, lots of innocents) the more people will 'terrorize' and so on. That war is one of the most senseless things i have ever seen. Major waste of the american tax payers money. If it were me, i'd spend it all on internal security. All and then some.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The thing is to stay brassy and just go in, take them all(the whole jihad wagon)and confront resistance with force, or nothing really changes.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No one can't stop the 'Jihad wagon'. See, it started with some fellows in the wrong, who did some vile things and killed a lot of innocent people. So the one who's hurt starts to retaliate ( not much blame here), but innocents start falling, by the hundreds. The more people that fall, the more the general muslim nations are agitated. It is an ever worsening cycle.<br>
<br>
PS: I'm not fighting Americans, i'm not favouring the Taliban ( i don't care about em really). I will just fight the misunderstanding the western media plants all around against Islam. I just seek mutual understanding. <br>
<br>
So please, do not flame me, if you have any questions related to Islam, do ask! <br>

<br>
What you say may or may not be true of Islam, however, there are documented atrocities by the Taliban that are horrid and similar to what Zariel said.  I am not sure of the particular of the rape charge, however I can tell you of several others:<br>
<br>
<br>
(Keep in mind this is the Taliban, not all coutnries of same/similar religious background.)<br>
<br>
Basically, women are regarded as nothing there.<br>
<br>
All women MUST wear a complete veil (cant remember the name - rashka maybe? )  over her entire body whenever outside the home.  This includes the eyes.  over the eyes, women are allowed a screen.  There has been an increase in auto accidents (women getting hit because they cannot see cars coming toward them) as women cannot see out of their veils with the screen.<br>
<br>
Any woman who leaves the home MUST be accompanied by a male, FAMILY member.  IF a male family member does not accompany the woman, she can be beaten publicly.  There are roaming &quot;gangs&quot; of men who do just that.  There is no trial nor questioining.  Any woman without a male family member is beaten instantly on the street.  Want to know the biggest problem with this?  A lot of women are widowed and do not have male family members to accompany them anywhere.  If they have four kids to feed and go out to beg and get caught, they are beaten.  (By the way you do know that the women are not allowed to work correct).<br>
<br>
Any woman who is found adulterous is executed.  Please bear in mind there is no trial nor questioning of the woman who has been accused.  Biggest problem with this besides the severity of the law?  There does not need to be any proof or even suspicion of actual sexual contact.  If a husband or male family member for example, sees a woman talking to a male stranger (not of the family) this can be an accusation of infedility, which punishment is death -  public execution.  Which btw are carried out in the football (soccerr) stadiums that used to house cheering fans.  THe woman sometimes is not even told why they are being executed, let alone questioned.<br>
<br>
A new law recently passed by the Taliban?  Women are not allowed to be examined or treated by any male doctor, but only by female doctors.  See the difficulty with this?  Women are not supposed to work outside the home, so there are few medical personel that are female to begin with.  Those of other nationalitites left long ago.  Now, women are denied basic medical treatment unless it is done by another woman.<br>
Keep in mind it is commonplace for women to die in childbirth or after due to infection.<br>
<br>
Another new law?  The Taliban recently declared that any house that has a woman living in it - all the windows must be painted black.  This is so that no man may walk by the house and see a woman without her Rashka (again cant remember if that is the correct word) on.<br>
<br>
Women are not allowed to be educated either.  It is death for a woman to be caught attending a school of any kind.<br>
<br>
Now, the Taliban is an extremely harsh group.  They have placed all of the burden of any sexual contact or desire upon the woman while the male walks free.<br>
<br>
There are many more atrocities the Taliban has committed toward the Afgan people.<br>
<br>
I, for one, hope that on our way to get Osama Bin Laden that we knock this govt. out of power.  I think that would be a good thing.  The previous govt. was not as bad as this one.  <br>
<br>
Also, we have some responsibility here.  It is our fault the Taliban is even armed, and Osama Bin Laden.  During the Cold War when the Soviets moved into Afgan, we countered by doing the same.  Which side did we fight with?  Whom did we teach and arm?  The Taliban.<br>
<br>
I am not saying we should have stayed to prevent the 10 year civil war that followed.  That would most likely have resulted in colonization fo the Afgan country, and I am sure that would have gone over really well with Muslims in general.<br>
<br>
Another thing people may want to keep in mind - The Taliban is a govt. where there is not a separation of church and state.. the state IS the church.  Why does this make a difference?  Because a lot of the laws etc that they are passing are in their eyes, directly from their Holy Book.  Most likely, they feel their actions are justified, based upon their religion.  In their eyes, they probably are doing what they think God wants them to do.  <br>
<br>
And btw, according to the Taliban foreign minister -  this is not a jihad, a word that has become synonomous with holy war, though that is not its literal meaning.  In all honesty, I think they are lying.. reason why?  Israel holds lands that belong to Muslim countries.  In Israel's defense, they have taken these lands in reaction to attacks or invasion - basically in self defense and have offered them to be returned IF the muslim countries sign a peace treaty with Israel.  The Muslim countries do not agree to the treaty and what happens -  nothing, Israel keeps the lands.  According to the Koran, if a Muslim nation decided to go to war to retake those lands held by Israel, they would be jsutified in declaring a Holy War.  If the nation (lets just say Country X), chose to declare a Holy War on Israel, and then called for other Muslim nations to join in the Jihad.. well guess what?  It is considered an obligation to go to war with the country declaring the Holy War.  Country X (the one declaring the Holy war) also can declare a Holy War on any nation who helps the one they are declaring war on.<br>
<br>
Do you see where Bin Laden can indeed make this into a holy war.  He only has to stretch it a little far.  However, even if it is a justifiable Holy War, killing non-combatants like he did is considered extreme.<br>
<br>
Now, for those that want to argue any of these points here are some disclaimers... have I actually seen and read the Koran or any Muslim law? No.  Have I personally spoken to a Muslim judge or member of the Taliban to get this information? No.  Have I spoken to a Muslim who has converted? Yes.  Is she a woman? Yes.  Did she live under the Taliban? No.  Where are these supposed atrocities documented? Amnestry International.  Where did I get most of the background on the US invlovement and the Koran.  Same place as you - through study and lectures.  There is also a recent teaching at my church that covers a lot of this information.  The information on the enw laws passed by the Taliban were gotten there.<br>
<br>
Despite that I do not live there, and I could never 100% believe the propaganda on both sides of the fence, I absolutely do believe that these atrocities are true.  They were recorded by Amnesty International BEFORE the war started and before Sept. 11.  <br>
<br>
With all this said.... I believe Sister Zariel.  And I also think we are headed for a long invloved road here with this war.<br>
<br>
If any of my information is incorrect, I would appreciate a link to where you found the correct information, simply for my own understanding.  I have not posted much on this war as I have truly been attempting to understand the reasons behind the scenes here, of which there are many.  Its almost easier to fathom Osama Bin Laden's reasoning than it is our own reasoning in leaving Afgana nd now retunring and what we really hope to accomplish there.  The Taliban will not give Bin Laden up.  Ever.  We are in for the long long haul here.  And we need to step carefully as we will be stepping on many many toes before this is over I think.<br>
<br>
Am I for it?  yes, I do think this is a just war on our part.  i do hope that we contain our killing to as many combatants as possible though.  Otherwise, we have ended up punishing a people even more for something we created in the first place.  That does NOT mean it is our fault that the Taliban won the civil war in Afgan, nor are we responsible for the atrocities they have committed.<br>
<br>
But, I certainly think it would be absolutely wild to see Osama Bin Laden try to live as a woman under the laws he agrees with.  No one would believe him and no way would the Taliban support someone who even used to be a man but is now a woman.  Their own laws would not allow it.  THey would probably have to change him back to a man again in order for him to function in their society.<br>
<br>
Anyways, total rant off about the war.<br>
<br>
Oh, and btw, feel free to disagree, but if you are disagreeing with any of the atrocities committed, I'd love to research that for myself, so please post where the information you received can be studied.  <br>
<br>
As always, no spell checker or proof read.<br>
