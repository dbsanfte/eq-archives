<br>
For now I am going to throw in some nutshell responses, not as an attempt to avoid anyone but because there are many responses required at the time.  Plus this is some cool shit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
-Space and Time is a system that exists by itself.  <br>
-Social laws potentially exist by themselves(needs more than one or some a culture to develop) &lt;----mans attempt at creation, which in its developed state can become very powerful and refined.<br>
-Order and Chaos are derivadives(bad spelling) of Space and Time.  <br>
-Love and Truth is God's law.  IMO of course God created Space and Time as well, but Love and Truth is ultimate.  <br>
-All of these systems have general and intricate process'.<br>
-The only system still in question is Love and Truth.  <br>
-In order to survive in Space and Time, one does not need Love and Truth.<br>
-In order to survive in a Social System we do not need Love and Truth.<br>
-In order to survive on a spiritual level we need the abstract laws of Love and Truth.  I mean ultimately.<br>
-Humankinds Social law is not Love and Truth.  We would like to think it is however.  But I think we can all agree that the world(In a social context) is a rather fuked up place.  <br>
<br>
____________________________________________________part two____________________<br>
<br>
-The brain is not an involuntary organ, parts of it are, but not all of it.<br>
-Generally, people do certain things.  Mathematical equations can be used to describe emotions and I can't wait till the day for someone to distinguish between values of emotion inmathematical terms.  This is something I have been thinking about sonce high school.  <br>
-BUT, I see it as a process like, information funneling into different pathways then finally coming into a final area of the brain.  A choice area if you will.  This place does not make all decisions.  I believe there is another place which acts as a kind of 'checks and balances' of this 'choice area'.  The choice area gets approval and is allowed to tell the rest of your brain to put it into action.  Of course this is all speculation and has not been proven by anyone(At least not that I know of).  The phenomena is that this 'checks and balances' part of the brain does not make any decisions, it only allows the 'choice area' the approval to officially make the decision.  Because of this, the area is not bound by anything, however I do think it can be influenced.  But this being the case, it is a variable with the value of based on experience.  AHH, that probably didn't sound like me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But without existing physically, the question of free-will cannot be asked.  Unless we are talking about spiritual realm.  Anyway, this 'checks and balances' area causes consiousness.  Hence free-will.<br>
<br>
Let me check some of the other stuffage.<br>

Quote Lurikeen:Are you saying that &quot;nature&quot;, in general, has moral qualities? Are apples themselves morally bad? If a Tiger eats a zoo keeper did the Tiger &quot;sin&quot;? Or, are you saying that prior to the eating of the forbidden fruit Tigers didn't eat zoo keepers and apples had no moral disposition? And why do you think free will was exempt from this decline to nature?<br>
<br>
-Nature has no moral qualities.  One could say that Nature has its own inherent system of morals, or laws that keep itself in check.  But, errr, it does not have a choice so it cannot have morals. <br>
-Yes the tiger sinned. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  just kidding but that shit was funny <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But we can replicate the 'bad thing' or 'sin' that the tiger did by creating a social law that he could comprehend.  <br>
-About the apples.  Other than being funny, I'm not sure what you are getting at.<br>
-Don't understand your decline to nature statement, but I can say that nature is remarkable, I don't think it less of me.(But I do think it is different)  To me, nature as we see it is a creation of God but is not the only world that exists.  But anyway, I just don't quite understand what you mean there.<br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen:The world without social laws is neither good or evil.<br>
<br>
Very true.  Sounds like innocence to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But we can distinguish between good and evil.  Good or Bad.  Innocence is a goal of mine.  Thnx for bringing it up.  I would love to live in a place where there was no good or evil.  <br>
<br>
Quote Lurikeen:Also, I find it funny that God could create beings with free will, knowledge, and have them live in a paradise and his only answer to their choice to have knowledge is to take away paradise and remove the sinners from his presence?! <br>
  Hmm, as far as I know, the Bible didn't say that God said we couldn't experience life or challenges or anything else except the one thing that would hurt us.  To me, I see bitting the fruit as heroin.  I mean, the addict would say, &quot;man you gotta try this shit blah blah blah.........  Just like you said, &quot;I don't have to do heroin to know I don't want it&quot;  Or, something like that.  I see it also as someone from the world trade center on the 87th floor who got burned all over their body, learned somehting wonderful from it but won't throw his kids into a burning fire in order that they 'learn' from it too.  We discovered good and evil when we bit the apple.  Some sort of numer or quality of experience will bring you to a level of truth that will bring enlightenment or something like that and it will be wonderful but that doesn't mean you want your kids to go through all that crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I surely don't know what God knows so I am not sure, but death must not be as bad as we think it is.  <br>
<br>
Quote:I would say that god is not very creative at all.  <br>
<br>
Somehow I believe God loves your sense of humor.  Its challenging and taunting, now say that to his face <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
Quote: Hold on... I thought eating of the forbidden fruit would give us an understanding of life? Weren't we supposed to get knowledge of good and evil? <br>
<br>
Not really.  As far as I know there are no 'cheat codes' for life.<br>
<br>
Quote: In either case, the Christian never gets to deal with themselves. They never get to take credit; hence life for them is one long state of moral bereaving.  <br>
<br>
Pretty passionate statement Lurikeen.  I haven't thought too much about this on a general level.  Like I said before, I tend to be arrogant so I have for the most part tried to humble myself unless I am 'The Bomb'  I am only good at a couple things.  I mean things that I have never met anyone else to be as good at.  And they are not very important in terms of status.  But I don't think there is anything wrong with screaming out loud in pride as long as it is not an attempt to differentiate between something in the way of 'good and evil', as you put it.  If you beat someone in a basketball game one on one shoudl you scream, &quot;YEA BITCH YOU SUK I KIKED YOUR ASSSSS BITCH I AM BETTTER THAN YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!!!<br>
I think there is something wrong with that.  But if you obtain a level of performance that brings you to a new level of ability or breaks you through some kind of barrier I think its fine to say, &quot; YEA MUTHA FUKA, EAT MY DICK RAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH (meanwhile punching your fist through the wall but not that you are better than anyone.)&quot;  I don't see anything wrong with, &quot;RAAA .......!!!!!!!&quot;   If your friend does something great and does the ,&quot;RAAA MUTHER FUKER&quot; then you will be happy and laugh your ass off.  If you find that your friend is doing that all the time then you might think he is getting a little power-hungry and its going to his head.  Then, there is gonna be a problem.  Otherwise,  I just can't see anything wrong with that.  Hehe, God is not the master of slavery.  <br>
I guess I'll stop it here for now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
&quot;-Space and Time is a system that exists by itself. &quot;<br>
<br>
Space-time is relative to observers. Without observers there would be no space-time in and off itself. Space and time are much like colors, tastes, sounds, smells, and textures. All of which are contingent upon observers.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Social laws potentially exist by themselves...&quot;<br>
<br>
I disagree. Social laws have no existence at all. One can't coherently speak of a social law existing in and of itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Order and Chaos are derivadives(bad spelling) of Space and Time. &quot;<br>
<br>
Order and Chaos are perceptions. There is no such thing as &quot;order or chaos&quot; with out individuals.<br>
<br>
&quot;-Love and Truth is God's law.&quot;<br>
<br>
Love is an emotion. &quot;Truth&quot; winds up to be what the community of thinkers agree upon. <br>
<br>
The rest of your ideas rest upon the analogy you use between space-time and love/truth. I still don't follow the correlation you want to draw here or its relevance to what I have stated.<br>
<br>
What I have gotten from what you are saying is that we have Free Will and that because we have free will there is morality. Without choice we would be automatons and there would not be a moral world.<br>
<br>
If you think about this a moment (not that you haven't at all, I mean now) you might wonder what the first humans were like before the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was made available to them. Were they just automatons? They apparently had no &quot;choice&quot; so morals didn't exist, from what you are saying. If such was the case then why did god want to change that? Because he loves us? Does that make sense? Couldn't he have loved automatons? Doesn't he love monkeys and lizards, etc? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If god created the fruit (a means to sin; hence exercise free will and create morality) because he wanted his creation to choose to love him, then isn't he a moral monster? After all, much pain has been the result of his little act just so he could get some loving. Seems pretty egocentric to me.<br>
<br>
Well, we are far off my original post on this matter. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lurikeen Mali'Kyre<BR>
