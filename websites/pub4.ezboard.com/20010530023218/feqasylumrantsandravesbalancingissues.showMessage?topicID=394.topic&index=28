It's the teacher's job to help troublesome kids.  It is not my job to cater to beggars, newbies, or anyone I don't darn well want to.  It's a game.  I play to have fun.  Catering to beggars 24/7 is most certainly not fun.  I assure you that helping someone out and then having them be rude to me will most certainly not make me feel better.  I say this from experience.<br>
<br>
My dog comparison is a direct response to the following quote by you:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I believe that giving beggars who aren't generally open to advice a piece of equipment will make them more open to some advice. It is like catching a bird with a broken wing, and helping him/her heal.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
My point is:  Giving a beggar something and then telling them to stop begging isn't going to work.  They will remember that begging got them an item from you, not that you told them to stop.  It won't help them to &quot;heal&quot;.  Most of them have no interest in &quot;healing&quot;, so long as they get stuff.  The only thing that will cure them of this behavior is not catering to the behavior, so they realize they are wasting there time and should actually, gods forbid, bother going out and WORKING for what they want.  Which is supposed to be the point of the game, I thought.<br>
<br>
I cannot remember the last time I charged for a port.  I wouldn't think of charging someone for a sow.  I sow people constantly.  It's become instinctual.  Is it so wrong of me to want a thank you when I go out of my way to be nice to someone?  Is it so wrong of me to not want to waste my time with people I know won't appreciate the effort I put into helping them?  There are 1800 people on average playing on Lanys at any given time.  If I'm going to help people I'm going to have to pick some because even if I worked 24/7 at it, I couldn't possibly help everyone.  I'm going to pick the people I know will be grateful, and I know don't think the universe revolves around them, because the server doesn't need any more whiny brat beggars.  The server needs more responsible people who appreciate help and are therefore also willing to give it.<br>
<br>
Giving a beggar something doesn't build his character, not the game character, not his personal character.  All it does is tell him that the game and the people in it will hand him things on a silver platter if he's annoying enough.  That's a truly unfortunate lesson to teach someone, because eventually it's going to come back and bite them in the behind, whether in real life or in game.<br>

Untrue Nibl. Most beggars know that begging is wrong and frowned upon. Most of them know how we earned our stuff, they just, from their own words, just want money. Ever been begged by a particularly annoying beggar, and then created a little level one to beg from them and &quot;see how they like it&quot;? 99% of the time, you get the response back, &quot;I hate beggars and never give them anything&quot;. Mmmm hmmm. Confront them with their hypocrisy and you get any one of several variations of &quot;I just want money&quot;. <br>
<br>
Heck, when I tell them that the best and most honorable way to get money and equipment is to go out and earn it, I've actually had beggars tell me that &quot;I know that, but I want it now.&quot; Well they can't have it NOW. Especially when they are rude and demanding. Do you think I care if they quit EQ? I'd prefer if they did.<br>
<br>
There is sometimes that one or two percent of newbies that beg that really DON'T know its unnacceptable behavior. These people are easy to identify. They <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> stop</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> begging when you politely enlighten them, and throw in some tips for leveling and gaining &quot;l3wt&quot;. These people are not rude or nasty. They don't go out of their way to irritate higher levels. <br>
<br>
The rude ones are the one's that know better in the first place. These are the one's I will not hesitate to give a nice, shiny mod rod.

Theoretically, the teachers took on a JOB in which the IDEA was that they were supposed to get paid to TEACH.  If they do a bad job then they should be FIRED and sent off to get another job.  This game is not my job.  I did not buy this game and pay ten bucks a month to spend all my time catering to newbies.  I have NO obligation whatsoever to help ANYONE.  My contract I clicked &quot;yes&quot; on to play this game does NOT have ANY mention of me being required to HELP anyone.  If I choose to help anyone it goes above and beyond the call of duty, and I have EVERY RIGHT to CHOOSE who I wish to help.  Being a teacher has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with playing this game, in a manner similar to the fact that me being a software engineer does NOT require me to decompile the game and attempt to make it run better.  That is NOT a valid correlation.<br>
<br>
And again, for the 40th time, in bold so you might actually get it:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Giving a newbie beggar stuff will teach him ONE thing and ONE thing only, that BEGGING WORKS and is a VIABLE means of getting stuff.  This is a BAD lesson.  BAD BAD BAD lesson.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It is far better, for the future of the newbie and pretty much everyone involved in the game, that you merely ignore them rather than giving them anything, so as NOT TO ENCOURAGE THIS DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR.  Perhaps the best thing is to give them lectures nicely (though I don't give them lectures because I don't want to waste my time being CUSSED OUT by people who think they deserve this stuff and don't want to hear it) but I have NO obligation to teach them anything, I pay my ten bucks a month to play the game the way I wish to play SO LONG as I don't violate the TOS, which, again, insists that I do the following:<br>
<br>
-No KSing<br>
-No intentional training<br>
-No harrassing other players<br>
-No letting other people use my account<br>
<br>
NOWHERE in the TOS does it say that I'm expected to teach people, or give them stuff.  If you think that your time in game is best spent sitting in EC and lecturing those newbies who choose to beg then MORE POWER TO YOU.  Go on your holy crusade, but I'm telling you up front that you are WASTING YOUR TIME because they aren't going to listen.  I, and most of the people here, KNEW that we did not deserve ANYTHING from other people, and that BEGGING IS WRONG.  You should WORK for what you get.  This is a lesson that everyone needs to learn in order to be a PRODUCTIVE human being.  Stop preventing people from learning to be productive by encouraging this destructive behaviour.  You are very much NOT doing them a favor.  <br>

<br>
I am a druid.  I made a druid because reading over what a druid could do, a year and a half ago when the server was new, I realized it was the most helpful class in the game.  I wanted to help people.<br>
<br>
I do help people.  There are many, many people who will tell you that.  Heck, I have a res-capable cleric to help me help people, and the cleric stays bound where I bind so I can get an emergency rez to people very fast when necessary.  Actually right this minute on the other 2 machines, the rez capable cleric and my druid are getting their mana back to go in and take another shot at rezzing people who got killed.  They weren't in our group, we're being nice.  We had to run over here to do it.  Some days I just feel like going from circle to circle or hanging around newbie areas buffing newbies, and I never pass Orc 1 without at least sowing everybody.  <br>
<br>
Like I said, though, I have no obligation to do so.  Furthermore, I refuse to encourage begging, which I think is truly reprehensible behaviour which should be discouraged by any means possible.  People need to learn that if they want something, they should make every effort to get it themselves.  <br>
<br>
So tell me Jeka, do you help people?  You're a warrior. What's the last nice thing you did?<br>

<br>
Yes, I have stuff.  Yes, I worked hard for it.  I doubt you could have gotten any of the stuff YOU have without people from MY class, and you'd be doing a LOT more walking.  My tank happens to be my husband (real life).  I have gotten more of my class armor from Hate than from Fear, and I'm a druid (and no, I don't mean the new Hate 2 stuff.  I mean Vermiculite.  I've been to Hate twice as many times as I have been to Fear... because I'm there to get my friends their stuff).  I guarantee you I wasn't on Hate for my own armor.  Nor have I EVER asked ANYONE for ANY item.  Heck, I was in Chardok this weekend trying to help warriors INCLUDING YOU Jeka get their epic blade from the Queen.  What, you think I was in there for my health?  There's not really any druid stuff in there.<br>
<br>
You are missing the point entirely.  As I've said so many, many times... &quot;You want stuff?  Earn it!&quot;  Begging is not earning it.  Begging is not a good way to get things.  Begging doesn't teach you to succeed at goals, it doesn't teach you the value of hard work.  Begging is not going to outfit your character in planar armor.  Then again if you spend all your time sitting around and begging you'll never be planar I suppose.<br>
<br>
What about the players who do want to earn their stuff?  Who work hard?  Why should they have to put up with the begging and the insults that follow?  Why are you defending people who are so spineless as to think that everyone owes them something?  My point has never been &quot;I'm selfish and I don't have to do anything so I won't&quot;, it's &quot;I don't owe anyone anything, so I have no reason to give beggars stuff, in fact I think doing so is a horrible idea&quot;.  The fact that I don't owe anyone anything doesn't mean that I'm not going to help people.  It doesn't mean that I'm not going to be generous, it doesn't mean that I won't risk my life and my level (which I did for an hour yesterday) trying to get the corpse of some poor shaman I've never even seen before out of the Icewell Keep well (and we did, too) instead of saying &quot;screw you&quot; and continuing to xp.  It DOES mean that I'm not going to be an enabler for these people who are choosing destructive lifestyles, and it DOES mean that if I'm busy, I'm busy.  I have no obligation to leave what I'm doing to help you, though if I can, I probably will because I try to be a nice person.  If I can't, deal with it.  <br>
<br>
It's beggars and people like you who make me wonder if I should spend the usual half hour (at least) I spend every time I log on helping people out, a lot of whom I've never seen before.  If I'm going to work as hard as I do to be a nice person and then get dogged by someone who doesn't even know me, what's the point?  <br>

As far as I know you didn't do crap for me at the Chardok raid. I was there to raid with Adjani, the queen blade was reserved for Feador. To even think a queen blade would drop for every single warrior is absurd.<br>

Yeah yeah, you're the victim, getting attacked for being a goody goody. Cry me a river, Fel. It isn't about you!<br>

I've earned all my stuff. So how could I miss your point? Do you even know what I'm talking about? You obviously don't, and I suggest you find out, or forever sound clueless.<br>

You can sugar-coat it all you want, Fel. I told you it's simple truth. Everything you do is ultimately for self-gain...and not only YOU, but everyone else too! Isn't that great? Ya know what? That's not a bad thing either.<br>

I've done nothing to you, I hardly know you.  <br>
<br>
Are you just having a bad week and want someone to take it out on, and you arbitrarily picked me?<br>
<br>
If I'm attacked by a beggar for not giving them items, then yes, I am the victim.  Do I care all that much?  Not really.  Is it annoying?  Yeah, but I'm not going to lose sleep over it.<br>
<br>
If you honestly think that everyone does everything they ever do expressely for self gain, then I'm amazed to find someone more cynical than even I am.  Wow.  Even I have a little faith in some people having good will.  Then again, I try to do things just to be nice.  Or maybe I just do it for the warm fuzzy feelings I get, I'm sure you would claim that's self-gain, to be nice to someone because it makes you feel good to be nice.<br>
<br>
Did I hope you and every other warrior would get a chance to at least roll on a blade on the Chardok raid?  Yeah, that's why I went.  Did I expressely do something for you?  Here's a hint:  backup rescue cleric Myahel happens to be my husband and my character.  Do I care whether or not you think saving the raid a round of coffins for summon corpse and a fight back to the safe stairs was a valid contribution?  No.<br>
<br>
Do I think your world revolves around me?  I hope not.  If it does, you have a lot more problems than I thought you did.  Was I offended at your statement using my name?  Sure.  But I'm also aware that you're apparently just a bitter person looking for a fight, so I'm not going to let it bother me all that much.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice people&quot; don't arbitrarily pick people they don't know to make accusations towards and cuss at.  I don't think you're a nice person.  And, before you get all uptight, no, I really don't care, because I've avoided any contact with you so far by sheer chance until the Chardok raid and this board, and in the future I'll do my best to avoid it on purpose, because you're really not someone I think I would want to know, to be honest.  <br>
<br>
So, take a few deep breaths, chill, go outside and take a walk, or just sit around stewing and being bitter and screaming at people, whatever.<br>

Yes...you are confused.<br>
<br>
You were wiped out too, Fel, and I wasn't rezzed by you either. It was convenient for you and your husband to have a cleric camped out there in the off chance the raid was wiped out, because Chardok can get ugly pretty fast.<br>
<br>
So it was in your best interest, which I shall also repeat once again...is not a bad thing.<br>
<br>
No, Fel. Don't assume about me in real life...again. Everyone in this <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> game</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> does everything for self-gain. Compeltely, and totally different. Next time please read carefully.<br>
<br>
I did not 'pick' you, if you re-read once again, I merely used you as a small, short example, and generalized you with the rest of the player community.<br>
<br>
You don't even have ground to stand on, Fel. You've never talked to me, you've never inquired about how I am, you've never asked what's up, nothing.<br>
<br>
The only time we met was on the raid, and as far as I could tell, you had no problems. <br>
<br>
What was the very first tell you sent to me? &quot;so what have you given away?&quot;, as if I were some greedy person.  As if I've never helped anyone.<br>
<br>
The difference is, I don't expect thanks, if I help someone then okie pokie, no big deal. <br>
<br>
I think you're offended because you do make a big deal out of it.<br>
<br>
I'm calmly typing away in front of my computer, replying to you. Exclamation marks do not imply anger, they just emphasize. Something which appears to be needed, since I can't explain any more clear than I already have.<br>
<br>
If you have to tell yourself that I'm huffing and puffing and trying to blow your house down, then so be it. Whatever floats your boat, Fel.<br>
<br>
If you really wanted to know me, then sending me your rather vehement /tell while I was in the middle of a General raid wasn't the best way to start.<br>
<br>
I already apologized in here and in game, if you haven't noticed, for things you've decided to take personally.<br>

<br>
Chardok?  I rez'ed the cleric that used a rez stick on you.  Does it matter?  Not really.<br>
<br>
If my tell were sent at a bad time, you could have told me as much.  You didn't bother, therefore I assumed the time at which I sent the tell was just fine for having a conversation.  I'm not omniscient and you didn't bother mentioning the fact that you were on a raid.  I am rather curious as to why you would say we've never spoken and then talk about me sending you tells.  <br>
<br>
You haven't apologized here.  You've insulted me further by calling me a &quot;hypo@#$(*@#%crit&quot;.  I usually consider anyone cussing at me to probably be an angry person, whether written or spoken.  <br>

What was the very first thing you ever said to me on this board or in game?  A comment stating that I'm a selfish person who doesn't care about anyone.  As if I were some greedy person.  As if I've never helped anyone.  If you were generalizing, you shouldn't have used my name.  I am not, after all, the only one on the thread with that viewpoint.

Maybe you do, but I don't.  And I know plenty of other people that don't.  The fact that you're a bitter person doesn't make all of us that way. *shrug*  Do I spent 100% of my time being altruistic in a way that would make Mother Theresa herself jealous?  No.  Nor have I ever claimed to.  But I do try to help people out when I can.  *shrug*  Heck, you told me you gave some newbie warrior crafted armor, where is the self gain in that?  Even you do altruistic things in the game.  /cheer.  At least I'm assuming you were just trying to do something nice.<br>

Doesn't sound like you know much about teaching.

Giving to beggars does NOT help them, but hurts them, and hurts everyone else too.

I never have money, mostly because I give stuff away too much.  I sell items sometimes, but instead of buying things, I buy stuff for others.  I give to lowbies, often.<br>
<br>
But, what happens when a n00b comes into the game, and they meet someone great, and that person gives them a twinkie item?  And they aren't very motivated players really. . . and they make a new character . . . and they need money for spells, and they remember that high level who gave them money or items like it was nothing . . . <br>
<br>
Essentially, they are now in a frame of mind that says, &quot;this was so easy, I have to do that again&quot; and they don't realize even the feasibility of getting it themselves, they have never done it, it is not within their idea of &quot;possible&quot;.  So they beg more.  And the harder they try, the more they Expect, the more people don't give and get upset when they try to beg.  <br>
<br>
Have you ever seen someone drive up next to you in a mercedes, when you're driving an escort?  Have you ever thought, darnit, I wish I had that car.  Maybe thought, they should give me some cash, cause they are obviously rich with that car they are driving . . . maybe you do think that way.  <br>
<br>
What do you all think about welfare?  Do you think it works?  If so, why?  If not, why?  I personally subscribe to the theory that it does NOT work, it only creates welfare addictions.  But that is a whole nother rant.  <br>
<br>
I say, beggars are like alcoholics.  A few items given . . . is a good buzz . . . a lot of fun, some happiness.  And for most people, that's all it ever is.  But some people aren't self-motivated enough, they need things made easier, so they drink to &quot;get through&quot; things that are hard, they create a dependency, much like beggars stop saving all their loots because they know (or at least think) they can get some level 50 to pay, cause why not, right? what harm does it do ?? it's small change man !  Bah, it's the first stage of alcholism to deny your problem, as it is with beggars.  <br>
<br>
I agree COMPLETELY with the person who said if you ask, you get NOTHING, and if you don't ask, and I have it to spare, you will have it.  Giving is fun.  Making others happy is fun.  But, like booz, even like ciggarrettes, if you have too much given to you and you start to rely on that as a means to obtaining things, instead of becoming &quot;elevated-from-a-normal-state&quot;, you are merely &quot;normal-from-a-depressed-state&quot; . . . homeostasis . . . that's all it is.  <br>

I called your attempts 'pathetic jabs'. In other words, I wasn't offended.<br>
<br>
I know what a joke is, but if I said you have a watermelon stuck up your pussy you wouldn't laugh. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That's not humor. I think I graduated from Beavis &amp; Butthead type comedy quite some time ago.<br>
<br>
Every person has different tastes of humor, if men wearing panties and having things stick out of their butts is funny to you, then so be it. I don't have to think it's funny, and you certainly don't know anything about me still.<br>
<br>
Cussing doesn't = anger. People cuss all the time, and if you think men wearing panties is funny, a little 'fuck' here and there can't be too hard to stomach. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Aside from that, you wanted a fight and ya got it. Now you're being a bitch because you've lost all ground. The only thing left for you to do is to justify your actions to save face.<br>
<br>
Hiding behind the guise of humor is nice, but I really don't buy that a person would make so many posts, reiterating their points like a broken record, wasting their own time in game to start an arguement, all for the sake of humor. Really...it just doesn't fly.<br>
<br>
I truly don't know what your problem is. You continued to fight, even after I apologized. You've already admitted what I say is true. You do do things for personal gain. We wouldn't get very far in this game if we didn't.<br>
<br>
I've already admitted fault for anything you've taken personally by me mentioning your name, so what now?<br>
<br>
It's been established that our humors differ, great. Two different people with different likes and dislikes. Problem is, you can't deal with it, other than avoiding me or attacking me.<br>
<br>
Do you know any other alternatives? I do. Why don't you accept my apology, take my word for what it is, and things can be like they were before?<br>
<br>
As for the general raid, I got three tells during that raid. Two other people said &quot;Oh, you're in kith&quot; and didn't send me another tell till I was in EC.<br>
<br>
I wasn't anonymous, I wasn't there for xp, there's not really much more a reason a warrior and about 20 other people would gather in Kithicor. A simple matter of putting 2 and 2 together.<br>
<br>
Anything else you wish to argue about, or are we done? I really would rather just be your friend, but I won't change the things I say for you. There's not much reason to.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#D5D4D5><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukelynatempestwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelyna Tempestwolf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>h0x0r!</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>5/14/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#000033>5:25:57 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://guardiansofdawn.homestead.com/files/DRAGON.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Begging is the same as alcoholism</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Eesh, break it up you two!
