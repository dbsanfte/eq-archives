Short version:  I lent Bariond an Iksar Regen BP, with the explicit conditions that it was NOT to be sold and that it was to be returned to be given to my twink when he no longer needed it.  Four hours later (!!), he was trying to sell the BP in EC.<br>
<br>
Longer version: <br>
Bariond was a member of domination (although not a very active one) and, when my BP dropped during a recent Hate raid, Bariond asked if he could borrow my old Iksar Regen BP.  I agreed and let him borrow it, with the explicitely stated condition that he was NOT to sell it as I wanted to eventually give it to my warrior twink. He agreed and told me to let him know when I needed it back.<br>
<br>
As a consequence of his actions during this raid, the officers of Domination decided that he was not someone that they wanted associated with the guild and /guildremoved him.  <br>
<br>
Shortly afterwards, I was told that he was selling my BP in EC. I contacted him, he denied trying to sell it and asked why I wanted it back so soon after giving it to him.  I told him I was worried that he might do something rash out of resentment for being deguilded.  He immediately went /anon and logged shortly thereafter, neither agreeing to, nor refusing to return the BP.<br>
<br>
The next day, I logged into EC on a twink (syrleey), saw that he had a new guild (name irrelevant, they are deguilding him and have no blame in this incident) and was advertising to sell my BP.  I asked him to return it.  He immediately went /anon.  I contacted his new guild, explained the situation.  They said that he claimed that I GAVE him the BP (explicitely NOT true) and that he had already sold it (unlikely, given the timing, but possible).  I can only presume that this scum sucking *hole will never return my BP and thus am coming to these boards to do my best to make the rest of you aware of what a loser, mfing ahole this piece of shit is and that you should refuse any association with him at all, hopefully leaving him to sit alone in a dark corner, all alone, wondering why nobody wants to play with him anymore.<br>

Earlier today, he tried to get me to trade back (claiming the boots were only worth 2k and I ripped him off). I told him sorry, I already spent the cash. Now I see why he wanted to trade back.<br>
<br>
Well, I still have the Iksar bp. If nessecary, I can hold it for you until something gets worked out. But I can't give it back for free =/ (sorry, currently all my money is invested in this bp, and I'd get screwed for something that wasn't my fault). <p><BR>

He also suggested that it seemed to him like both sides have different ideas of what the terms of using the BP actually were. <br>
<br>
At this time we have decided to let Bariond carry out his probation period with our guild. That does not mean we have sided with him. That means that in this situation I don't have all the facts nor would it be fair to pass judgement simply on hearsay by either party. It does however mean that this person will be watched closely and if any further credible complaints are recieved he will be /guildremoved. Bariond understands this and knows he is under scrutiny. <br>
<br>
This is the best I can do under these circumstances. If you have any further questions please contact me in game. Thank you. <br>

However, I don't think I am going far out on a limb to predict that you will find yourself wishing that you had nothing more to do with Bariond before long.  Best of luck with him and dont leave him holding any guild loot...He might 'forget' that its not his to sell.<br>
<br>
Fisarik:  I likewise do not hold you to blame for any of this.  You are an innocent bystander pulled into this as a result of a trade.  My interest in the BP was only that I had been looking forward to giving it to my twink when I got my better BP...I agreed to let him use it only in the interests of helping a guild main character before improving a twink.  If you have any use for an Arbitor's Combine Greatsword in exchange for it (or if you have any other characters for which I might have stuff they can use), I would be happy to make the exchange and write this all off as a lesson (I guess I should be happy no one else has ripped me off in over two years of playing EQ, but instead I just feel irritated that this scum has decided to reward my willingness to lend him a semi-valuable item with this bullshit).  <br>
If you have no use for this item or just dont want to trade, no hard feelings. I'm the one who got screwed, not you. No reason for you to suffer for my mistaken trust.<br>

He was one of the most stand up, honest, greatest cleric I knew. To hear that he has done something like this amazes me. Never would I have thought he would have committed such a thing. I can only hope that this is not the origional Bariond I knew, and that he has passed his account on because he wasn't able to play anymore. Maybe thats the reason why recently he has been online frequently again, unlike the past few months where he has not been on at all. I'm still having a hard time believing this, I'm sorry you got screwed out of your BP man. <br>

Fisarik also posted here while I was writing my initial post so his involvement was after the fact. After I did see his post I went back and discussed this with more officers and we decided to boot him. We did so based on the original complaint, a second complaint from Domination, poor behavior on the raid we took him on, and on Fisariks post here.<br>

1) never loan out gear to an eq player, unless<br>
1a) you know where they physically live in real life and you are within distance to go harm them with instruments of destruction.<br>
1b) you are sleeping with their wife (this is called the pity loaning) and gives you more time to bang his wife while he is online masturbating over the uberloot you just loaned them<br>
1c) midgets - physical midgets not halflings/gnomes/dorfs.<br>
1d) its your wife, well unless she aint giving you none then she dont get the gear right.<br>
1e) The god almighty, I mean if he tells you to do it, you have no choice, I mean shit there are tons of people in jail that said god told them to do something like kill their parents, who are we to judge.<br>

<br>
I got a message from him earlier this month on another character that he had left EQ, and given the account to someone else.  I believe in my log file I even have the name of who was getting it, and I intend to look and see if thats so.<br>
<br>
The original Bariond was a kind, considerate, and upstanding person.  I just wanted to post this, because, I'd hate to see HIS reptuation ruined by the new Bariond.  That said, I guess you need to be careful who you give your account to if you don't want a bad repuation.<br>
<br>
To those that have lost items, I'm sorry.  I'll see if I have contact information for the original bariond, maybe he can put some pressure on this person or something.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions feel free to contact me in game.<br>

You may get tired of explaining it to everyone that /tells you, but then a lot here dont agree with account trading/selling.  Live and learn.<br>
