But I was just scared to walk in the street yesterday.<br>
<br>
First of all, I want to tell you all that everyone in Europe is completely shocked by the events in USA and that you are all in our thoughts. I want to once again say that our heart is bleeding from what we have seen.<br>
<br>
I have been in front of my TV screen way to long yesterday and have seen my share of sorrow and atrocities for an entire life. For this, there is no excuse and the guilties have to pay the price.<br>
<br>
But, I want to share some thoughts for now. At the time I am writting this, no one took the responsibility of what happened in USA. I repeat, NO ONE. Even the talibans (Afghanistan) have condemned such an act. Only Irak (Saddam Hussein) have said nothing and an ultra faction of Islamist have rejoiced. DO that make them guilty? I dont think so. They are guilty of rejoicing for the death of innocent people, for inhuman bahviour in a time where everyone should feel compassion. But that is all.<br>
<br>
Ben Laden have said nothing for the moment, but he has the profile and the money/infrastructure to do that. So he could be the responsible (could I said).<br>
<br>
Some people have said the unthinkable already. If it was American people who had done that? Some analyst are thinking that militia (dont remeber the name right now) who hate the establishment in USA have the power, the money and the people to do that. It could be that or it could be Ben Laden or it could be someone else. For the moment, no one have the slightest idea.<br>
<br>
About the Palestinians celebrating. I cant understand how an human being can rejoice for the death of someone. I know USA is considered as the Great Evil by them, but there is no excuse for their behaviour. Though, wanting to murder them isnt the solution. Keep your hartred for the people responsible of that. Not for fanatic with a washed brain, raised in the idea of USA = DEVIL. They arent responsible of that and dont deserve your hate. They are low and should stay low in your esteem.<br>
<br>
One of the best analisys I have heard was made by a woman who had maybe my age. She said that today, terrorist of all the world just signed their death sentence. Today, we are all american and we all share your pain and suffering. Everyone on earth, even pople who dont share sympathy for USA are in shock. (I dont count those nobrain people celebrating that in Palestine) The people behind these atrocities cant hope today for a place to find refuge. They have lost thier cause forever.<br>
<br>
The analyst also said something extremely interesting. This is the first time since Pearl Harbor that USA is hurt in their home, on thier ground. Isolationism is over now. USA cant say we are safe now and we dont want to act with the outsider. USA is now the aim of Fanatic and Idealist in their own country and this will change the face of the world. I have to say that I fully agree with that. What happened today (yesterday) will completely change the world and with the help of everyone, it will be for the best. <br>
<br>
Once again, I want to share my feelings with all of you who live in USA and tell you that I am horrified by what happened. The murders have to pay and they will. But dont act to fast and make innocent pay. You are better then the people who have done that. <p><center><b>Nosfy Vifargent - The Lil'yoddling Paladin<BR>Officer of The Phoenix Crusaders - Guild of Erollisi

the millitia may have the money/power/people to do what was done today.. but they usually aren't willing to kill themselves for thier cause.  I doubt you could convence 20 americans that you know (the FBI reports say that there were 3-5 per plane.. and who knows how many other planes had people on them that never got off the ground or landed before the terrorists had a chance to take control of them) to sacrifice thier own lives just to make a point.  <br>
<br>
This was definitely the work of a fanatical middle east terrorist organization because of that one fact alone (in my mind anyway..) We know that suicide bombers are commonplace in such organizations.<br>

<br>
Why, well the pentagon, sure that makes a reasonable target for them but as far as the world trade center, I would think that, and this is my opinion, they would have went for the UN, that is a more understandable target ffrom the viewpoint of the american militia.  <br>
<br>
So in saying this I tend to believe that there is some country outthere harboring a gutless leader of some religious lunatic fringe that will soon be nothing more than an entry in a history book that no one will ever read. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uealan01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ealan01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/12/01 10:08:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  american militia doing this?</span><hr size=1> OK... Well, in a few days (today even?) we will know, with some certainty, who it was.<br>
<br>
If the worst terror attack in world history was the work of amateurs (US militia are clearly not advanced terrorists), then they need to die.<br>
<br>
If it was the work of the most experienced, advanced, well financed terrorists in the world - the Islamic extremists who are backed by governments - then.... what?  Should we get them?  Let me guess, *they* shouldn't die, right?<br>
<br>
Iraq said, and I quote, &quot;The US has reaped the fruit of their crimes against humanity&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Taliban has said &quot;We have said repeatedly that Bin Laden does not do these things&quot;<br>
<br>
The official newspaper of Palestine backhandedly endorsed the actions even as Arafat said it was a tragedy and his people celebrated.<br>
<br>
It's pretty delusional to think that this wasn't the work of mid-east extremists.<br>
<br>
And, by the way, I would like to say thank you to Europe for standing by us AND for providing me with the above news!  The US news seemed not to be reporting things like the above (I guess to keep a lid on us).  I learned the above from the BBC.<br>
<br>
You are NOT going to get ANY admission from ANYONE... EVER.  So, in the end, if you choose to continue to believe that this was perpetrated by black helicopters, you will be able to do so.  Criminals and terrorists actively attempt to NOT get caught and don't leave great trails of evidence (When they are smart).  At some point you have to use some logic and instinct or no one ever gets caught, no? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ukytherion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kytherion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#E9D756>(9/12/01 10:47:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrfrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  american militia doing this?</span><hr size=1> American militias would've chosen the IRS, the DOJ, the FBI or even the NAACP.

This point is now VERY moot.<br>
<br>
The FBI already has evidence that the pilots were arabic nationals and know exactly where they learned to fly.<br>
<br>
The learned to fly in Florida and stayed with some nice American folks who were willing to put them up while they learned.<br>
<br>
Nice irony eh?  I guess not all Americans are &quot;the great Satan&quot;.  Funny that this simple act of charity did nothing to disuade these shitheads from their &quot;holy mission&quot;.
