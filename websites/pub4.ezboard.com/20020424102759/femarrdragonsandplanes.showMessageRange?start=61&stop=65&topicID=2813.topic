<br>
     Ok before you go invent a new long lost child or some other shit to co-verify the shit you've been feeding everyone try this... use a fucking spell checker so at least one of your personas doesn't have the typing skills of a nine year old. Everyone smells the shit, nobody wants to step in it again. I think at this point you could present a cold body and still nobody would believe you, but alas you cannot do that. All traces of her existance have been wiped from the planet. Damnit Janet. How convenient. IF she were dead let her be dead. If she pops up again for any reason whether it be an innocent ebayer or the person who recieved her kidneys upon her death with the express will &quot;that you keep my pixelated representation alive&quot; should be scorned. <br>
     I agree a lot with Jexie. Let me expand on that. Not only do I think it insulting to think that anyone but moi could play Ritt the way I see him, I think it insulting to me to keep my fucking memory alive in a game. Good sweet Christ I thought this game ate alot of my life but I know that it isn't my life. When the time comes and I shall take my rightfull place in hell I hope everyone I knew can turn there monitors off for a day and get together and look at the life i have lived and shared with them.<br>
P.S.  and don't ever fucking compare a life to a computer generated landscape shitball. <br>
P.P.S. Not only do I think whoever you are should be dead or all of you you wastes I wish whatever cursed the planet with your existance had just aborted you and made the world a better place.<br>

<br>
Sissal and his pain have nothing to do with the Daglett situation.<br>
<br>
Let me sumarize for those of you who have not bothered to read the post and instead have come to pick on Sissal for misspelling.<br>
<br>
1. A long time ago someone named Daglett hurt a lot of people by faking their death.<br>
<br>
2. Just recently, Sissal's in game sweetheart may or may not have died and an Aunt is playing her character. Sissal chooses to believe that his girlfriend has passed on, rather than facing the possibility that she is deceiving him.<br>
<br>
3. Someone posted the similarity in these situations on this thread.<br>
<br>
I wholeheartedly agree, it seems rather ridiculous to keep someone's eq character alive in some spirit of rememberance. <br>
<br>
But please remember: Sissal is the victim here- whether by losing someone he was close to in game through their death, or through their pretending to be dead- please don't treat him like he has hurt anyone, he has not.<br>

Jenn the lady i met in game and fell head over heals for about a year ago, died 2 weeks ago. all i did was post in general that she had passed away as eq was her life for the past 8mths as its been mine.  i figured least i could do for was let people that we know, no what happened. and the easest way i knew to do that was post it on the board here as i know alot of people come here and read them even if they dont post, like me for example i only started posting a few mths back but have been comming here for a while now but that is beside the point.   i have no clue who this Daglett's person is, i only posed on this thread as a friend of mine sent me an email stating that my posts were mention here and that someone said it was mighty similar to what happened with Daglett a while back.<br>
<br>
As far as i know her chars are being played by her aunt, no reason in hell for me not to believe this. and jen had talked for months about wanting to get to 60 as there was all kinds of cool spells ahead of her, especially after seeing one of my friends mage in action.   even though eq is just a game, for some of us its alot more, i mean think of all the friendships you have made here.  I'll admit when sherri told me that jen wanted her chars to stay around, i was very upset about it thinking how could i handle seeing her chars every day knowing that its not her behind them. but i have spent countless hours talking with sherri both in-game and out of game, i am 99.999999% certain that she is not my sweety  that is easy to tell from anyone that knew jen.<br>
<br>
Caoilfhionn you said basically that you thought i was the same person as Daglett because we both misspelled the 2 words.  i didn't know how to spell it and running a post thru a spell checker didn't even run thru my head, all i had done was copy and paste how someone else spelled it.  sure am not the first or the last to do that.<br>
<br>
maybe i am just crazy, but for me and a couple other close friends of mine, seeing jenn's chars every day and taking to sherri, has made it a hell of lot easer to deal with jen not being here any more, as half the time we sit around telling stories about things we have done in game and sherri tells us stories of when jen was growing up crazy things she had done.  it helps me anyway, and i know it helps her aunt. at-least thats what she told me, and like with jen passing away i have no reason in the world not to trust it.<br>
<br>
rittdabard, so i cant spell. neither can you when your running on anger that someone accuses you of lieing and making up a story for sympathy from others. i never asked anyone to do anything for me or for her, except pray for her when she was in the hospital. and i am not gonna &quot;invent a new long lost child or some other shit&quot;.  first off Ssisal is my oldest and main char i cant even get into making another char and keeping it past 15th, so he IS my only persona online that has to do with eq.  i also find it very rude that your just insulting me and trying to make into another person.  i have nothing to do with that daglett person, never met them before in my life.<br>
i dont if all traces of her have been wiped from rhet planet.. havnt looked. i can tell you that she never left a trail behind her, as her life growing up was very messed up and shes changed her legal name many times to hide from her biological father, as hes not a nice creature at all.  like i have said i have no reason not to trust that she in not dead.  For keeping her chars alive, if there were to be e-bayed, i would not approve of it, as someone i have never met talked to is taking over the account of the woman i loved, and wanted to have be my wife.  no way in hell would i stand for that, a friend of hers, family of hers yes that i could stand although it is kinda weird at times.<br>
<br>
probably repeating myself here but i do have no clue who that daglett persona was/is. i came to this thread  a couple days ago because it was pointed out to me by a friend that my posts about jenn were mentioned in it,  so i came and read what was related to me and responded.  probably doing the exact same thing that anyone else under the same situation would have done.   i know that i am not miluabc/dagl and i do know that i am bryan who sometimes goes by the name ssisal.<br>
i came here trying to clear up a misunderstanding and get ripped on for it and accused of all kinds of shit.   gotta love it..(<br>

I thought you were the same person. I had read all the posts and this has just become such a convoluted mess. I was assuming this Jen's character's were daglett. Whatever the case I am sorry for jumping to the wrong conclusions. It is just that your poor typing skills mirrored thos of every other person who was this daglett character. At this point I think everyone is suspicious of anything to do with this situation. <br>
  I went on a huge rant because I do feel strongly about this. I have buried two brothers and I think death for game advancement is straight out bullshit. I love this game, but I love it as a game. It is an escape from reality, not a substitue reality, and therefore like I said, when I die so does my character. When I die only five or six people in this whole game will know, and they are the people I eat dinner with every friday, my real life friends.  I personally will never use tragedy as an excuse for advancement, nor would I trust anyone who is giving me a sob story in game. That is just me. To each there own. I have dealt with enough tragedy and drama in reallife that personally I find it almost offensive that people can't leave it out of a game. Yes I do play games to escape, but I never ever bring my baggage with me. I understand wanting to talk about things but I am not sure such an anonymous place as online let alone a game is the best place to do this but if that is how people cope that is there choice however when it messes with a lot of other people's gaming experience than you have just ruined others escape. <br>
      Again sorry Ssisal you got so screwed over here, and whoever daglett was/is/will be fuck off and die a slow painful cancerous death.<br>
