Lots more roamers wandering around. Once Fear is broke that's pretty much it. Pull the FF and TT, Pull the two towers and boogey house move camp to tower etc. Fear is kinda a walk in the park the other day we cleared it with exception of the temple in 3 hours and I've yet to even hear of a hate raid coming close to that. In addition a total wipeout in Hate means 210pp for another rock, Fear you can just walk into. <p><img src="http://members.spinn.net/~paradise/tanise.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D5D4D5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/usthistor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sthis Tor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>w4nn4b3!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/19/01 11:36:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raid rules</span><hr size=1> Well.. the question wasn't which plane is harder overall heh.  The question was, in which plane is it more likely the actions of 1 person could cause a disastorous raid wipeout.  IMO, a Fear break provides a much greater opportunity for a single person to wipeout the raid... even if it's only on zone in.  <br>
<br>
That's why many Fear raids now a days only send in 1/3 to 1/2 of their raid for the break... to try and keep it controlled, keep aggro down, and in the event of deaths you have people with gear that can step in.<br>
<br>
210pp isn't that much to a raid leader capable person or guild. <br>
<br>
Don't want to hijack this thread anymore though.  Just posting my view on planes raiding... less is more.  Not saying that what anyone else does doesn't work for them heh.  <br>

But if you amongst the first to post and one of the first in your class, i don't see why people who posted at the last minute will get picked over those who planned, reserved their time to attend, and etc. <br>
If that's how raids will be planned I should just show up at the last minute before everyone sets up. Just my 2 cents. You post about all these rules and BS on how to be noble and stuff, Yet you deny people the respect of including them in something they said they will attend. <br>

&quot;5. Don't ever be left alive with no clerics camped out after a train. In cases like that, being selfish is the worst thing you can do. Sacrifice yourself to give the clerics a few more seconds to get out. If you do so you may even end up with some rather cool screenshots hehe. Got a few of those myself, being left all alone in PoH with clerics camped out and a few dozen corpses lying around... and of course those 5 clerics of innoruuk beating on my sorry ass.&quot;  - Ulaian<br>
<br>
I will never forget one occasion like this. A long long time ago, on a Mithril Web raid, where some disastrous train by freak killed every cleric but me, and as the last alive cleric, I was told to camp. During those 30 seconds the sheer number of bodies thrown between advancing mobs and my seated self, only to be cut down, was horrendous. It was both touching and chilling to see ... and through their efforts, I camped out, and the raid was rezzed from there.<br>
<br>
As the cleric, I did nothing but watch them fall, knowing I had to make it out. The melee AND casters with their bravery did everything. It probably saved a 1-2 hour CR (at least).<br>
<br>
Enough said. <p>------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>

When I host a raid, and I know there will be more signing up than there will be room for (unfortunately almost all of my raids have turned out that way), I explicitly state how I will choose peeps to go on the raid, and who will go on the waiting list.  That may or may not include when you signed up, BUT I will extend my raiders the courtesy of letting them know before the raid starts whether they are on the roster or not, by posting said roster for everyone to see.  You may not agree with how I choose who goes on my raids, but as long as that raid has MY NAME as the leader that's my decision and not yours, and any flaming of me for it will most likely land you on my no-raid-for-joo list.  I realize you are not talking about me as I've never even heard of you, but that's an answer to your question that I think many raid leaders would support. <p><center><img src="http://www.theroyalknights.org/sigs/adjsig7.gif" >

It may be totally different for each raid leader. But this is how I do it. <br>
<br>
Most of my raids are semi-open. Meaning that there are some people that are invited before the raid is even posted for the general public to sign on. These people have a reserved &quot;seat&quot; for that raid. These could be people that are usually allied to my guild or friends. If the class slots are filled for that raid from the invites, then I won't take anymore from that class barring any unusually circumstances. If there are no-shows, I fill them up with whoever is there on my list and are actually there at the starting point. The reason I take only those that are there is because you made that extra effort to actually show and will do what I can to get you in. I'll go down the list (usually in date order of who signed up) and see who is there. If you signed up, I expect you to be at the starting point. If you aren't there then you weren't that interesting in going. <br>
<br>
Like Fae and Adjani, I would rather take a lower level player that I know to be competent than a higher level player that I don't know at all.  Doing raids, I have to trust the people I bring with me. And I agree totally with Tanise about having one person wipe the whole raid. I've been there where one person makes a mistake and kills the entire raid on more than one occasion. <br>
<br>
However, I still do take people I don't know or are new to raids because people have to go through this. Last Hate, I took almost 3 groups of inexperienced planar people. But because I knew that most of the characters were good players, we had a great time up there. Raids are very dynamic and some decisions have to be made quickly, trusting that everyone does their job.  They listened and did their jobs up there. It went EXTREMELY smooth. <br>
<br>
You also have to realized that there are limited slots for raids. They fill up very quickly so I suggest you do what you can to weigh your chances on getting on them. I took a a bunch of planar newbies up there last time in Hate. Some I met for the first time. And some impressed me with how well they followed orders and how much fun they had. It's gratifying to get tells at the end of the raid telling me how much they enjoyed the raid and when the next one is. That means I did my job well enough that you are willing to go with me again. And it works both ways. If you impressed me, I will take you up again. Get to know the raids leaders out there. They are people too.<br>
<br>
Probably the most satisfying aspect of leading raids for me is when it's done. I'm tired and finally the raid is over. But I'm smiling because it went so well. <br>

And hence I can very much agree with. I just suggest if you wish to be a good leader you state those rules. Because I would like to believe I am a competant druid. I have grouped more than most druids. So I feel I'm a team player. And you got to agree that you can't trust someonen until you give them a chance. I find it very upsetting when you CAN'T even put me as last in the reserve. That just shows I wasn't even considered. Correct? I mean is it safe to assume that? Unless you know i'm a stupid druid, and you hate me for some reason I can understand, but as far as I know I've only seen you once in a raid (fae) , and I will add you did play your character well, but I don't think you can make that assumption about me unless you were paying attention to my gameplay.<br>

To be honest I nearly choked when Tanise made the comment about the two &quot;best&quot; enchanters on Lanys earlier considering the format and turnout of BotB heh.  Not because I feel some need to assert that *I* am the best because that couldn't be further from the truth.  Lanys is blessed with many top notch enchanters and I for one believe that acknowledging someone else is fantastic doesn't in any way lessen what I can do.  <br>
<br>
As for the specific points,<br>
<br>
lead a raid : yep<br>
<br>
handle loot: nope.  I don't like doing this.  Also on my planes raids the pull rate is pretty close to constant so the person handling loot is busy almost all the time.<br>
<br>
mez overpulls:  The *team* of enchanters does this yes.  When I'm up there it isn't the Akbar show.  We all lean on each other and work together doing what we can do to get the pull under control ASAP.<br>
<br>
keep a list of every person and what buff they need : yep, every person I am responsible for buffing which in the past has included the whole raid.  I routinely do this on HoT raids.<br>

keep buffs current at all times:  Within reason yep.  Sometimes people get dispelled.  Sometimes in the middle of buffing a train hits and I have to mez a few mobs which adds unexpected delay... propogational delay also comes into play on very long lists... but for the most part the majority of people that have been on my lists in the past can probably tell you that they don't have to worry about their buffs I am responsible for.<br>
<br>
btw - buff lists aren't hard to maintain.  Raids tend to be pretty static.  It takes me 5 minutes at the outset to agree with other enchanters who I'm buffing and make the lists.  After that I have two markers that I use to keep track of where I am in the lists as I go.  Often times I won't wait until the buffs are completely gone before I start rebuffing.  To be honest I spend very little time thinking about buffing... it has little to do with talent and everything to do with the process/system.<br>

After telling him many times that that was BS, I finally had an &quot;excuse&quot; -- and I would tell him, I lost the botb, go ask Luulu to be your enchanter since you have to have &quot;the best&quot; :P<br>
<br>
Honestly I don't know why he brought that up in this thread though, because I can't think of anyone who thought the botb was a reasonable measure of who is the best enchanter.  One match came to melee, most came to who could train the other enchanter, and the rest were who just sat there mana sieving while the other was dumb enough to aggro the skellies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/umathii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mathii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>p0\/\/3r-p0sT3r!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(10/24/01 5:42:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: raid rules</span><hr size=1> I love the list and don't think this thread should have anything to do with a dick waving contest between enchanters (with all due respect to the good enchanters posting).<br>
<br>
Condensed set of rules without the 'whys' (if you want to know why read the first post).<br>
<br>
1. Pay attention! <br>
2. Make an assist key. Do not EVER start attacking in any other way than hitting assist. <br>
3. Don't go on a raid and then leave after 2-3 hours.<br>
4. Don't bitch. Period.<br>
5. If you are not a cleric and the shit hits the fan do everything you can to help get a cleric camped.<br>
6. Get a map of the place you are going to. If you are lost and do not have a map, just sit tight, ask for help, get a loc and die if you have to, NEVER TRAIN THE CAMP.<br>
7. Don't just go to the plane where your armor drops. It makes you look like a greedy loot whore.<br>
8. Do not expect exp or loot on a raid.<br>
9. Don't go off posting shit about a raid. If you have some constructive criticism, I am sure they would be all<br>
ears AFTER the raid, but there is just not time for a long discussion while it is going on.<br>
10. Reduce your lag.  If you don't need it turn it off or down, /serverfilter on.<br>
<br>
11. Always sacrifice a gnome for good luck. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
12. Do NOT bother the raid leader with non-essential crap. <br>
13. If you must leave, let the raid leader know. <br>
<br>
14. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> When you sign up for a raid, you have signed off your right to do things &quot;your way&quot;. You will abide and do what the raid leader tells you to do. A raid is not a committee decision deal. If he tells you to run to your death. Do it. Good raid leaders do things for a reason. If you cannot abide giving up &quot;your rights&quot;, do not go to the raid. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
15. Signing up on a raid does not mean you automatically get you IN the raid. <br>
16. Know the raid loot rules ahead of time. If you cannot abide by the loot rules, don't go. <br>
17. Dont get drunk / fucked up on raids.  It may be fun for you, but it pisses everyone else off.<br>
18. Whiners suck.  Don't bitch in any public channels or to the raid leader(s) before or during a raid.  Remember you arent the only one there, and most people on the raid will not get loot, exp, or special attention.  You are not entitled to any of it.<br>
<br>
I love raiding, but the person who said it only takes one or two assholes to ruin a raid is correct.  The person who said the people who need to read this probably won't is also correct.<br>

<br>
My only concern was that the thread was getting way off topic.  These are guidelines for people who are getting ready for their first raids, not hard rules for people with enough experience to make their own judgement calls.  I just cleaned them up and condensed them since a lot of people just scan posts and don't read in detail. <p>Mathi Bear<BR>
