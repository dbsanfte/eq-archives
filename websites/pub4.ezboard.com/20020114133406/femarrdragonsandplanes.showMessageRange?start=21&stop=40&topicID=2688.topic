I find it interesting that you chose to discuss something, in a fairly accusatory tone, on a section of the board used to gather folks interested in participating in pick-up raids.  Perhaps if you'd chosen to bring the discussion to general or R&amp;F yourself, where it clearly belonged from the beginning.  But that would involve you taking responsibility for something, which as we'll see here shortly, you don't intend to do.<br>

Oh, you're not flaming, but you are making assumptions on where someone else thoughs might lie.  I flipped thru the D&amp;P section, and that's the only post I saw setting one up.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for the things that you assumed that I would do, you could have done all of those things yourself.

Did you do any of those things, other than hijacking the thread she started to organize one?  Somehow, I don't think you did either.  If Silverain is lax for not following your list of actions, so, I would think, are you.  <br>

You have a responsibility to communicate in the exact same manner.  Since you didn't set up a raid prior to her doing it, you can have no beef now.

They can do exactly what you  propose and communicate that want.  Or is this to hard for you to understand. She shouldn't have to send a tell to everyone who might possibly want a shot.  Hell, there's no way she could do it.  <br>

<br>
For the record, I'm not in any of the guilds, nor do I know the majority of folks posting here in support of the person arranging the raid.  I do know that I find it amusing that you lambast her friends for supporting here, when you and the troll run around patting each other on the back no matter what the topic.  Out of curiousity, do you have more than one brain, or do you share one?      <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uforishadowmoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fori Shadowmoon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 368<br> <font color=#E9D756>(11/27/01 12:33:52 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.evernight.com/pics/ico/Makenna.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VS (Re: Sagemon)</span><hr size=1> ok THIS sacred me darmu:<br>

I think our views on pickup raids are probably quite similar.  Sadly, it appears that many of your guildmates and allies do not share your views.<br>
<br>
This comment caught my attention:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So my point is, we do not and shall not have any intention of &quot;hogging&quot; the pick-up rotation slot.

<br>
That begs the question: what do you consider to be the rules established by the community in securing a slot?  Siilverain and some of your guildmates seem to believe either (1) that there are no rules, and that the pickup slot is FFA, or (2) that the proper way to obtain a slot is to ask Siilverain's permission.  If CBA/VP is taking either of those positions, the system is not going to work.<br>
<br>
Let me respond to a few of the much less thoughtful comments by Cao:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I flipped thru the D&amp;P section, and that's the only post I saw setting one up.

<br>
There is only one pickup slot per month on the VS rotation.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Of course</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> there are no other posts setting up a VS raid.  The only reason why someone else would be organizing a VS raid would be if they planned to gank Siilverain's raid.  Duh!<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if you think that the D&amp;P board reflects the entire universe of pickup raids, you are quite mistaken.  There is no way of knowing the percentage of pickup raids that are organized outside of the D&amp;P board, but it is fairly significant.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If Silverain is lax for not following your list of actions, so, I would think, are you. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You repeat this basic argument over and over.  However, there is a big difference between me and Siilverain on this issue -- Siilverain claimed the raid spot without taking any of those steps, and I did not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Since you didn't set up a raid prior to her doing it, you can have no beef now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If that's correct, then the pickup slot on the VS rotation is purely FFA.  If that is going to be the position of CBA/VP, there may be some unfortunate consequences.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Or is this the famous &quot;if I like you, you'll get an invite&quot; type pickup raid. Explain to me how that's is a pickup raid anyway.

<br>
Are you suggesting that this is the way that we run our pickup raids?  If so, you're quite mistaken.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> She shouldn't have to send a tell to everyone who might possibly want a shot. Hell, there's no way she could do it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Agreed.  However, she could have posted something on D&amp;P saying that she was interested in claiming the slot.  We would have responded by saying that we wanted the slot this time.  Then we would have discussed the matter and worked thing out.<br>
<br>
We were planning to make a post along those lines on the D&amp;P board.  Before we could make that post, Siilverain unilaterally claimed the slot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And you've known the pickup raid turn was coming for exactly how long?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We'd been talking about it for a couple days, at least.  I didn't plan to post anything until after Thanksgiving weekend, given that many people would probably be traveling and away from their computers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Funny, based on your comments, I don't think you'd regret it at all. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, I really would regret it.  If VS goes FFA, it would be a hassle for everyone.  That may just be inevitable, though.  There are a lot less VS spawns than there are people who want to kill VS. <p>Sagemon Prayeth<BR>

My vision of Sage's world.<br>
<br>
Ok heres the rules from now on.<br>
<br>
No raid shall ever take place without MY express permission.<br>
<br>
Anyone wishing to Ssch a raid must email me and post on the boards with a list of reasons I should let them raid on MY server.<br>
<br>
Every spawn from Derv 1 to Sleeper is now MINE. <br>
<br>
I dont care who you are or what your reasons are , your all out to make me look bad , you are all bound and determined never to let me run a raid again. <br>
<br>
I will not stand for it.<br>
<br>
All Posts on Dragons and Planes will now become my personal invitation to piss and moan about why I was not informed of all the details.<br>
<br>
This is not a list open to interpretation by the way. I have gone ahead and sent a copy of my rules to Verant and Sony , I am sure once they see how the world works I will be vindicated and they will let me do what ever I want. Now come on everyone join me in bashing Siilverain and her failure to beg my permission.<br>
<br>
<br>
:vision fades:<br>
<br>
Anyone else see this entire line of reasoning coming out of his responses? Everyone that has &quot; flocked &quot; to this thread is now a pal of Siilverain . You can not deny it Sagemon said it hence it must be true.<br>
<br>
Now I am sure he will come up with a million and one reasons why he is not really paranoid , note he will say perceptive. It all comes down to Siilverain did not ask his permission to run the raid nor did she follow his rules in posting a maximum of only 24 hours &quot; I am guessing here&quot; before the raid.<br>
<br>
I wonder how I ever got the reputaion of being a diplomat. I am not a nice guy , I do not speak softly and carry a big stick . I say it like I see it and here the apperance is appaling.<br>
<br>
When I have spoken to Sagemon in the past IG he seems so reasonable and even maybe a nice guy. So what the hell is it that turns that person into the weirdo that comes to these boards and posts this crap?<br>
<br>
I am at a complete loss as to why it was when he sat for a few hours at the rage camp last night he failed to bring up to anyone that he wished to run the VS raid.  Or is his point not that he wanted to run it but that no one should ever run it twice? <br>
<br>
Now that I have actually created what is for me a long post I will leave you with a bit of wisdom. <br>
<br>
When someone aks you what your planes are for the day or how your doing punch them in the face and scream &quot;WHAT FUCKING BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS?&quot;<br>

Since I have already run one VS raid it should be blatantly obvious that I would be interested in running another.  Last month, I did post asking if others were interested in raiding -- No one responded interest in leading, only joining the raid should I decide to run it.  Since the pickup rotation has come around again, the only communications I have recieved are from people wanting to know if I will lead it again.<br>
<br>
My question is this: <br>
Why should I, whom has already run a raid &amp; would be interested in it again, take time to contact all the pick-up leaders I am familiar with?  Why is this <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>my responsibility</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->?  Why didn't <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>you</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> take the time to contact me IG since you where having such a problem with my email?  Why didn't <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>you</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> take the time to post in General or D&amp;P, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Hey Siilver, Contact me IG. I need to speak with you&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
However, she could have posted something on D&amp;P saying that she was interested in claiming the slot. We would have responded by saying that we wanted the slot this time. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, I could have done that again -- that goes without saying, but I did not this time.  Curious, why hadn't you posted the same question?  However, back to my original question -- Why is it my job to ask you, Kerna, Jamster, Kalahari, Jexilia, Gorndax, Neville or Gravethumb etc. etc. etc. if any of you are interested in running the upcoming VS raid?  It seems to me, it would be much more efficient had you contacted me (refer to above suggestions).  I consider myself a fairly reasonable female and honestly I would have gladly stepped aside, then signed up for your raid hoping to go along.<br>
<br>
Logically, I fail to see where I am at fault here.  I will say again, I am completely open to rotating between pickup leaders.  In fact, that would be the best way to insure no one is really &quot;hogging&quot; VS pickup slot.  However, I fail to see how a pickup raid could actually &quot;hog&quot; this slot since it is comprised of different people each time...but I digress.  Until you decided to post on that thread, I had no idea you were interested in leading.  Reading minds has never really been my forte.<br>
<br>
One quick note however...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

That begs the question: what do you consider to be the rules established by the community in securing a slot? Siilverain and some of your guildmates seem to believe either (1) that there are no rules, and that the pickup slot is FFA, or (2) that the proper way to obtain a slot is to ask Siilverain's permission. If CBA/VP is taking either of those positions, the system is not going to work.<br>

<br>
First, the pickup rotation is a very recent addition to the VS rotation.  None of the raid leaders, save myself, have openly expressed interest in running a VS raid.  This is easily solved by communication (refer to above suggestions for the future) to set up a rotation inside this pickup slot. <br>
<br>
Second, where do get the idea my permission is required?  My raid didn't even create the pickup slot, where would I have any control over it?  Where have I made it sound as if I controlled this spot?  Examples, not inferences please, would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Does anyone else think this is like a big merry-go-round?  Same questions that are responded to with the same answers.  <br>
<br>
Sage, I recommend finding a more suitable way of contacting me regarding any issues in the future.  This is quite silly imho.  <br>
<br>
Now that your interest has been expressed, why don't we start working towards a solution for pickup slot rotation?  Or do you wish to continue this pointless arguement? <p>Siilverain the Wind Caller<br>

Fitzroy was nice enough to keep the pickup slot in the rotation given the last attempt was a failure.  I'm sure if it fails again this time, the slot will be eliminated and then another pickup raid will have to try again.  That would be unfortunate, but that's life.<br>

I have raided with both and find you all enjoyable to face these challenges with, as far as your personal disagreements I don't see how they really apply, and really having this kind of public discussion only hurts both organizations leadership ability and success.

Okay, there's ONE pickup raid slot a month on the VS rotation.  So you knew approximately 4 weeks in advance, yet when Siilver stepped in the week before....ON A HOLIDAY WEEK, where, I believe, people would need even more time to plan, she's somehow ganking YOU.  So, because you made the error of not planning sooner, it's someone elses fault?

Do your tidbits come in an 8 ball, you know where I can shake it up, flip it over and get some great pearl of knowledge?

Jesus, man, grow some balls and take some initiative.  If Silver hadn't posted, you've stated you and the troll had every intention of planning a raid on VS.  You just didn't post.  Did YOU send a tell to anyone stating your intention?  Well, no, I bet you didn't.  If you want a subrotation on the pick up spawn, organize it yourself.  I'm fairly sure that whoever is handling the guilds rotation doesn't want to do it.<br>

Here you come with threats again.  You gonna beat them up? Oh, you can't it's not a PvP.  So, I guess your unfortunate consequence is that you plan on ganking the VS spawn, per your other thread, whenever you feel like it?  I think you are wrong.  I think the unfortunate consequences would occur to YOU.  <br>
<br>
My comments might be less than thoughful, but I don't have anything to win or lose here.  My slot in the VS spawn is assured.  My guild status is not up in the air and I'm just pointing out the cold hard reality to you.

<br>
I'll say this, however: If you have a slot in the rotation designated for Pick-up raids, it's going to end up being an FFA slot...plain and simple.  The raid leaders for these types of excursions need to realize that and just move on, get your people together on the pick-up spawn date, and if you get beat *shrug* go play in sky or something and quit bitching.<br>
<br>
I swear...you guys don't know how good you have it nowadays with rotations.  Used to be if one group killed out of turn it all went FFA for the forseeable future.  Now you just bitch about it a bunch for the whole world to see and laugh at you, then continue along with what you were doing before.
