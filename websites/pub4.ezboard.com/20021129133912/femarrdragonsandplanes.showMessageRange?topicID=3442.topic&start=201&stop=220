<br>
yes, long ago. What is your point? <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;In addition what we laughingly call 'liability' for actions has been limited by the same mechanisms. Torts beyond the company assets are not recoverable.<br>
By carefully concealing company assets (or not as with WORLDCOM) there<br>
is sometime no way to measure worth at all.<br>
<br>
Right now the ONLY mechanism that intimidates business is tort, that is why they are trying so hard to remove it. Microsoft has proven beyond any doubt that if you are big enough, you can get away with anything EVEN if you are caught red-handed. The public did notice that.&gt;&gt;<br>

gross mischaracterization of the facts in my opinion<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If you lived in 1910 Kansas City and poisoned some child by trying to make a profit<br>
with say tainted oil (contaminated with dioxin for example) I suggest to you<br>
that you would find it VERY difficult to remain in KC. People were different then.<br>
Another example would be a man being held w/o actually being charged, by order<br>
of the state governor, this man was in custody in the county jail. A mob arrived<br>
and killed the two deputies and the prisoners. That man was Joseph Smith.<br>
I am sorry I forget the year.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
ok, so you have cited two isolated examples for your side and I have provided three for my side. Now what? Other than suggesting you are for vigilante justice, and apparently dont have the consideration for the law you profess to in your exchanges with Raed.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I suspect that is you are actually from the former<br>
Soviet Union you can give even more lurid examples of civilian justice.&gt;&gt;<br>

wow, and I am accused of generalizing. You have had a democratic president wag his finger in your face and lie to you. You excuse this by now saying it matters what he lied to you about. He has been found guilty by a federal judge of perjury (for our purposes this pretty much just means it is certified that he lied.)  He lied to his cabinet and hung them out to dry by letting them defend him when he knew all along that their defense was based on his lies. Roosevelt (the second one) lied about knowing about Nazi death camps in time to do anything about them. Kennedy lied to MLK and the Civil Rights movement to get elected. He lied to Sinatra and thru Franky to the mafia to get elected (actually he had Daddy tell that lie for him). So by your standards you have to hate all democrats too. Pretty soon the only people in the country you will like will be Ross Perot and that goofy ex wrestler. As an aside, if we are gonna have a governor wearing a feather boa, I would rather follow the italian example of electing an ex stripper than Minnesota's example of electing an ex wrestler.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Big money buys them politicians, and we let them do it.&gt;&gt;<br>

no, and I wouldnt try. What is your point?<br>
**************************************************************<br>
My point is that big business has succeeded in insulating itself from liability.<br>
They can do anything they want, and are simply unlucky if caught.<br>
(Directly relates to the excesses of capitalism you asked about)<br>
<br>
<br>
*************************************************************<br>
&lt;&lt;Ever read 'The Jungle' by Upton Sinclair?&gt;&gt;<br>
yes, long ago. What is your point? <br>
*************************************************************<br>
Perhaps I should have asked if you understood it, but I suspect the responce would be predictable. <br>
Tell me would you eat meat packed at that plant? If people died from eating it<br>
do you think there were be succeesful torts?<br>

*************************************************************<br>
Since when is siting examples the same as advocacy? I certainly do NOT think<br>
Smith deserved to be gunned down by a hysterical mob. The world was different then. That is what I said. This forum isnt a debate and I dont practice straight<br>
refutation unless its the easiest way. I dont need the same standards of proof<br>
(with kudos to Raed) The issue of the war bonds you sited almost caused<br>
armed conflict. That is how unjust it was.<br>

Ah yes you repeat the same disingenuous myth that FDR was a man of the people.<br>
NONONO, he was a member of his class PRETENDING to be a man of the people.<br>
Ok so he convinced most of the country. That doesnt make it true. FDR saved<br>
the capitalist system from the very real threat of revolution that the USA faced<br>
during the depression. Who caused the depression again?(hint: Big Business)<br>
He did the minimum he needed to do to calm people down. It worked. <br>
Since I wasnt alive then I dont have to like him. He is just a name in the book.<br>
<br>
Truman inherited the job. What can anyone say? You gonna call him a liar also?<br>
<br>
I notice you skipped Ike and his VP but rest assured I have studied that admin.<br>
Nixon carried a whole wagonload of @#%$ with him wherever he went.<br>
<br>
Kennedy??? He died didnt he? So who won? Foolish to even bring him up.<br>
He paid for his sins(if any)<br>
<br>
Johnson inherited the job. Just a good old boy that got carried away. Very sad.<br>
<br>
In the context of 'lies' we are forced to create catagories. 'Personal' lies.<br>
I know what perjury is and Bill C skated close but did NOT go over.<br>
He was not culpable. If that annoys you, CHANGE THE LAW.<br>
If he is guilty prosecute him. If he isnt drop the issue.<br>
And lies of state. I dont give a damn who or even what sex the Prez is drilling.<br>
If he lies about it, my opinion is that he should NOT have been asked.<br>
Just an example of the right fishing for an issue.<br>
However if we are on the brink of nuclear war, I want to know why.<br>
It makes me angry when I get lied to. It makes me wonder how much I can trust the admin. Just like Bush SR. denying his affair(w a woman) and glossing over the fact<br>
that it was HIS sloppy diplomacy that created the gulf crisis AND Somalia.<br>
Oh yeah Bill C sure looks like Satan compared to that.<br>
Makes me wonder how many other things the Prez lied about. <br>

That's never been the point regarding Christianity.  We've ALL sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God, which was the whole point to Jesus' death.  Sure, some fools will try and take a stand of moral superiority, but they're only fooling themselves.  Please don't chuck the whole religion simply based upon the bad choices of a few.  Because a Republican lies to you, do you toss the whole party?  Because a Hare Krishna lies to you for that flower donation, do you toss all of them?  Because an atheist lies to you to get your money, do you toss all of it?<br>
<br>
Merentha:  Why should the punk's Freedom of Choice trump mine?  Aren't we both equally capable of voicing our opinions?  If he chose to engage in debate over the contents of the Bible or some other discourse, I would've been happy to engage him in same.  After all, that's why I was there.  However, to have him burn a book I find to be enlightening and sacred, that's going too far.  (He was taken away by campus cops, not I.)  If he was burning some other books because he didn't approve of their content, I would probably have done the same.<br>

Treage:  No separation of church of state in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.  That phrase is from additional writings of Jefferson.<br>

He wrote passionately and quite well, but his argument was based on emotion, not the Constitution, facts or law, so I dismissed his argument as specious.  <br>
<br>
He described students praying in school, which is fine and perfectly allowable by the Constitution.  Students can pray in school by themselves, students can meet with other students and pray, students can read the Bible, the Koran, the Book of Mormon whatever, and I fully support their right to do so since those rights are protected under the 1st Amendment and Freedom of Speech.<br>
<br>
I repeat that school led/facilitated prayer is a violation of the Constitution and the Establishment clause.  The government can show no preference for any religion over another.  <br>
<br>
It's interesting to see how those who advocate the breaking of the wall of separation between Church and State always assume that the State Church will be their church... <br>

That statement is not taken from a religious book.<br>
It is a generalization for us to interpret, just as much as the Constitution is for us to interpret.<br>
So I still think after all this debate it is Constitutionlly sound, and do not see any religion in the pledge, or religion in state.<br>

<br>
Let's try and get back to the subject at hand.  Please indicate how the phrase &quot;under God&quot; is either establishing a religion or prohibiting the free exercise of religion.  The separation argument isn't from the Bill of Rights, but Jefferson's other writings.  As we are talking Constitutionality, we need to stick to the source.<br>
<br>
Hearing the Pledge read, isn't stopping you from exercising your religion.  Requiring the Pledge to be read, isn't establishing a religion.<br>

Isnt it obvious that saying 'under god' forces the person saying it and the listener<br>

What is they dont wish to do that? Is 'their' choice then subordinate to the<br>

god exists. I also dont care if I am. It doesnt matter to 'me' <p>“It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster.”

<br>
That is your opinion.<br>
<br>
Where are your facts to back up your opinion that hearing the Pledge read or being required to recite the Pledge is not unconstitutional?<br>
<br>
You have yet to have given one cite, or one iota of evidence, law or history to back up your claim, whereas I have given pages to support my side of the argument.<br>
<br>
This is the real reason I left this thread initally, no one with an opposing view will post a VALID argument, relying instead on feelings, thoughts and opinions.<br>
<br>
This is what the court in question had to say (note, they made their decision based on their study of the Constitution):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Citing a concurring opinion in a Supreme Court decision, the 9th Circuit said, &quot;The Pledge, as currently codified, is an impermissible government endorsement of religion <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> because it sends a message to unbelievers 'that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->'&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The recitation that ours is a nation 'under God' is not a mere acknowledgment that many Americans believe in a deity. Nor is it merely descriptive of the undeniable historical significance of religion in the founding of the Republic. Rather, the phrase 'one nation under God' in the context of the Pledge is normative,&quot; the court said in its decision. <br>
<br>
&quot;To recite the Pledge is not to describe the United States; <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> instead it is to swear allegiance to the values for which the flag stands: unity, indivisibility, liberty, justice and -- since 1954 -- monotheism.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/26/pledge.allegiance/">www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/06/2...llegiance/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
So, to sum up:<br>
<br>
1) I provided evidence that many of the Founding Fathers were not Christian and were in favor of the separation of Church and State.<br>
<br>
2) I provided evidence that the original Pledge did not contain the words &quot;under God,&quot; they were added during the 50s in an attempt to separate Communists from the rest of our citizens.<br>
<br>
3) I provided a definition of the Establishment Clause.<br>
<br>
4) I cited landmark cases of the Supreme Court related to these issues.<br>
<br>
Discuss.  How about some facts or Constiutional interpretations to go with those opinions?  The argument &quot;I don't think it's unconstitutional becuase that's the way I feel&quot; is a pretty lousy argument. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ufeathersilverthorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feather Silverthorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 234<br> <font color=#E9D756>(7/2/02 12:30:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/femarrdragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3442.topic&index=219>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chiteng</span><hr size=1> I am a guy.

Lets use the prohibition period, times changed, attitudes changed, opinions of the alcohol where made, debates of the law where made. The law was changed, after opinions where made that alcohol was ok.<br>
So when we give opinions is how things are made and changed.<br>
