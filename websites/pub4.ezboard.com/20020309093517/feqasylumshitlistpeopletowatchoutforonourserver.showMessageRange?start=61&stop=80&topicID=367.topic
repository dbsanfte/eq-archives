You only further prove our arguements in guildchat that you were NOT SA material. You don't have the drive, the commitment or the self sacrifice it takes to be in a powerful guild. And thats why we refused to let you back in. You can hate me but I have a theory, most people hate me because I speak my mind. Let me say that again. People hate me because I don't back into a corner and ignore things I see going wrong. I'm a very strong person and I'm not afraid to show it. You do good, then I'll tell you. I expect the same treatment. If I fuck up, I wanna know. Thats the only way you can grow as a person in RL, and a character in this game. So you flipping me the bird or whatnot, does not affect me. Its largely because you have a hard time accepting that YOU fucked up. And now you're paying the price. Your attitude is not needed on raids. You don't know half the shit that you think you do, how could you? Like Mystique said, and she stood up for you many times. You hardly EVER came to raids. Blame it on what you want, but like she said. You were on your twink screwing around when SA was struggling for wizards. We don't have that problem now. I feel bad for you that you feel you must speak down to everyone on that raid because you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THINK</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you know what you're doing. When thats far from the truth. <p><b>Elidrin Blade'Storm</b>

  I am sure everyone has an opinion on this subject, not just in Savena's case, but in all raids where a question of insubordination comes forth. <br>
<br>
  It is unfortunate one of our own was involved and resulted within this forum. I neither condone or defend their actions here, merely to post here to seek some resolution to this thread. The issue is now with the EoN leadership.<br>
<br>
  I will personally not post here any results from our talkings with Savena to justify Jedaka's position or defend Savena. I will handle it in game. I will leave the public posts to their discretion.<br>

Here is a piece of info: The thread is not about a problem between Jedaka and Anevas as such, but between Anevas and myself. And this raid was the first time EVER that I met her. Anyone thinking that there is some old war axe buried here, think again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
The point of this thread is Anevas' refusal to follow the instructions of the raid leader, and refusing to give people buffs in a way that would allow them a chance to survive. And not some matter of ancient hatred.<br>
<br>
Due to these things, yes, I do not like her. My first opinion of her however, before the buffing, was that is -did- like her. Keep in mind, that no matter what Jedaka is posting, the things he describe actually mostly happened between Anevas and myself, with him merely witnessing it.<br>

If you or someone else involved needs to talk to me, don't hesitate to send me a tell. I'll take the time needed to answer any questions, even meet with you if you feel that would help things. Also, if the EoN leadership needs to post something for me to read, but does not wish to use a public forum, your guild leader should have access to the GM forum, and I do as well. So, if you need to post in semi privacy, you can do it there. I wish to see this matter settled in some way as much as anyone, and the shitlist is hardly the best place to do it. <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

Also no,  this is not some old grudge that has posted this here,  I used think think Savena was an ok person because she was in Heart of the Phoenix for a while,  till she left to join SA,  but this was the first time being in a raiding situation.  I did not even recognize that Anevas was Savena backwards untill Anevas started acting up.<br>
<br>
And thank you the person from EoN that posted they will show the results of what the leadership of that guild will decide about Savena.

<br>
I let that be in the past and didn't take action on it. It wasn't worth it, and I deemed it to be a oversight or honest mistake.<br>
<br>
However some of the things she has posted Contradict what she was telling our Freeti group the other night.<br>
I&quot;m not sure that sit wells with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

on the boards she is quoted that she was not kicked out, she quit.  Savena...you told the group that &quot;so i log on later and instantly Ketsui gets someone to port him to me and he guildremoves me.&quot;<br>
<br>
her next words left a sour taste in my mouth.<br>
<br>
she talked about how she told ketsui that all the wizards were mad at him now and would lock him out of their accounts and refuse to go on raids...she went on to talk about that EVERY sa member was Forced to give ketsui thier account information and proceeded to bash for a good 15 minutes on the mentioned subjects.  She also tried to convince the group that she chewed ketsui out and gave him a leture and told him off.<br>
<br>
To Generalize,<br>
<br>
I have no anomosity towards her...but the words she uses to tell Untruths or partial truths do make me wary of her.  And I am not fond of someone giving false appearance on thier actions...<br>
<br>
Given that, I am not sure i can believe whatever she says in her defence...because instead of defending...I saw Bashing and Blaming...<br>

No,  having 4 fake buffs is not about saving caster mana,  4 was the number picked to balance 2 issues,  one issue is the more fakes you have the less real buffs you can get,  the next issue is that Vox dispells 4 buffs at a time so fakes ARE needed.  Also,  fake buffs are the worthless buffs that aren't used on the raid IE. see invis,  levitate,  low mana cost and useless.  I also can't believe you think Ulaian is an &quot;idiot&quot; for following raid leader decisions.   Also,  this isn't a matter of Anevas &quot;getting mad&quot; she endangered an entire group and if perhaps 1 other cleric acted like she did Vox would not be dead. <p><img SRC="http://www.geocities.com/diezzal99/Jed.jpg" height=206 weidth=432> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/utuonetar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuonetar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b!</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/16/01 2:26:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=367.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Savena - Alternate Character : Anevas</span><hr size=1> why are you the only one saying she endangered the raid?<br>

There were several other clerics present, so the raid was not in real danger. But, very much endangering the group though. I fully understand that you want to defend your guildmate, I would probably do the same thing, but don't you find it curious that not -one- of the people who were actually there, has spoken out in her defense? <br>
<br>
The one person I had expected to do it, Ryogahibiki (who is also in EoN, and was in the group. And stayed for the duration), has not posted at all. Though of course he may just not read this forum <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I have said before, and I still hold that opinion, that I agree this may not be an incident worthy of the shitlist. But, trying to turn this into Jedaka having a personal problem with Anevas is not even bending the truth. It is lying. I guess you had to be there to understand... Not meaning to call anyone a liar here, just keep in mind you weren't there. Only the ones who -were- there really know what happened, and so far they are all in agreement. Except for Anevas, who is the subject of this topic. <p>Ulaian Moonleaf <BR>

Seriously, giving your account info to anyone is pretty silly ... only prson that has mine is my RL fiance' .. and I don't think he even remembers my password.  In some cases where you are certain you can trust the person I suppose it'd be okay .. but just not something I'd feel comfortable doing.<br>
<br>
And Tuonetar, her actions have been verified by a few others by now, so even if it was a 'personal' problem, her behavior is quite clearly a problem for more than just one person.  Admittedly, he should have gone to EoN first, but sometimes people do things in the heat of the moment ... I wouldn't fault him for that. <p><br><img src="http://web.InfoAve.net/~tajulian/TankGirl_Sig1.jpg ">

You see the power of sugestion is at work here. Nothing concrete about this thread screams at me as being more 'vendictive' than exposing a players alt char. Has nothing to do with Anevas , but now you associate Anevas with this incident. <br>
<br>
You gain N-O-T-H-I-N-G from exposing a players alt char in this thread other than displaying your desire for them to be railed.<br>

<br>
Ok, I am going to try and clear some stuff up here and hopefully put an end to this, though whether or not this end's is all up to the Readers.<br>
<br>
Hmm, where to begin.  Well I guess the Using Resist Fire as a Fake is as good as Anywhere.  In Essence 1 and only ONE thing come's to mind, I AM IN CHARGE.  There I said it, and to let everyone know I really didn't want to say it, for all those that are upset about me saying that don't be, I am upset enough at myself for having to use it and say it.  You know in Mission Impossible Two were, Tom Cruise say's to the Girl(sorry don't remember name) &quot;Would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to go&quot; and she says &quot;Yes&quot; and he shouts &quot;THEN FEEL BETTER.&quot;  I love that part, and well that is how I feel right now and will feel even more so at the end of this Post.  Basically if you don't really like what I am saying, or think that I could have put it nicer, or it's leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, well guess what I have worse of all those, and with how far this has gone, and with how people never understand what you said becuase you didn't say it boldly and plainly enough, I am sorry but this is true, lots and lots of people take word's and sentences out of Context, I will attempt and try to make it here so that everyone understands and you won't be able to misunderstand anything I say.  Ok, now let's get on with answering all the good and bad remark's in Reference to me and my Raiders.<br>
<br>
NUMBER ONE THING I WISH FOR EVERYONE TO TAKE NOTE OF RIGHT NOW IS THAT THIS WAS MY RAID AND THAT I WAS IN CHARGE.  That mean's everyone is to do exactly what I say, and if they didn't like what I told them to do, or wanted to do something else, they need to do one of two things, talk to me about something they found in error with what I was doing, which I would look at and take into consideration unless I already had, or Two to Leave.  Personally I prefer the First one, I am sorry but I am a very forgiving person, and I find that a very good trait, but at the same time can get you into a lot of trouble, do to people taking advantage of that.  Let's say I took 47 friends on this raid, which is essentially what I did, or at least 47 people I knew, and I was confronted with a situation where I could lose one friend or another friend, or even lose one friend or five friends, I would opt for neither situation, I would opt for the immpossible and most of the time do it, to keep all friends.  Yes It can be done I have dealt with it and done it on many Occasions, mostly RL some Ingame too.<br>
<br>
Ok, as I stated in the First Post this should have been taken to Guild Leaders not to the Message board.  Yes it was hastily rushed here, but so are alot of other Shit List Articles.  But at the Same time it has its points which Varifies it as a worther Shit List Article and Material, so there is no problem with it being here, other than it should have been attempted to be solved ingame first not rushed to the Shit List.<br>
<br>
As for Buff's, I shouted Loud and Clear to not begin Buffing until I gave the GO.  I shouted loud and Clear Only Four Fake's, and for people to talk with there team to make sure people only had four fake's and no more, For everyone to say when they had four fakes to there team, and for team to cooridinate who would to which fakes.  I shouted very Plain and clear that Resist Fire was not to be used as a Fake as to that it interefered with Magicians and Wizards Elemental Armor which gave them a good amount more Resist Cold and Fire, the Cold of which they needed.  Anevas In all three cases did not follow my Directions and did as she thought was right.  This was very Wrong and did indeed endanger all of her teammates lifes in the fight to come, and by Endagering One Whole Team, that Resipercates on the Whole Raid Endangering it.<br>
<br>
Yes Anevas Did Abandon her Group.  Yes I did talk to Anevas.  Yes I did tell Anevas that if she was Going to Stay she would have to Follow my Instrutions.  Yes I did move a Druid to Ulaians Group for them to have a Healer.  Yes I did put Anevas into a New Group.  Ok that should do it for the Yes's.<br>
<br>
No I did not Beg Anevas to Stay, though Yes I did ask her to stay but told her she had to do what I said.  No I did not just Reasign Anevas to a new group, she did abandone her group and after talking with her I gave her a new group Assignment, and Replaced the groups Healer.  No I did not know that Anevas never Joined the new group I assigned her too, whether the group assignment shout was missed or Anevas didn't want in a New group, I don't know.<br>
<br>
Ok, to Clarify some thing's that are really Stupid.  1. This is not a Personal Vendata, or a long since Grudge that has been held for 40 Lvl's, perhaps you have a similar experience that is such, and this look's like your same problem, well it's not, if you haven't had then I really don't see where the heck you are getting some of this stuff from, and I really don't want to know.  2.  This in NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM, is anywhere similar or even comparable to A ONE TEAM CAMP IN HIGHPASS, or anywhere else for that matter, if you are Lvl 20 and decided to take a peek at the board, and see what was happening in the Higher life of Lanys, well stop Posting AIDING TO THE PROBLEM, Because you don't know what the HELL you are talking about, if you are say 50th Lvlish and believe that this is in Comparison to a One Team Camp, well All I have to say is &quot;GO on more raid's and learn something, or go back to Highpass.&quot;  I am sorry but stupid comments like that are not helping here, and yes neither is this reply to those stupid statement's But I am trying to go through and go over everything and hopefully just put a Bleeping Stop to this.<br>
<br>
Ok, It is getting late and I feel Really Really Sick after writing this Post, and remember &quot;Would it make you Feel Better if I didn't want you to go&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;THEN FEEL BETTER.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't like this post anymore than you, just hope it clears up some item's, stops people from making stupid post's because they don't know what the HELL they are talking about.  I didn't say it, but that would mainly be do to the fact that they weren't there, along with perhap's being Lvl 20 or never having been on an actual raid before.  In General hopeing to put this Thread to a Complete Stop, the Point has been made known, the Guild Leadership is now taking a look into it as should have been the way from the start, like experiences have been brought fourth, Several peoples Standings have been burnt and singed, and of course as with any Post anymore an SA Bash took place and SA Flames were Ignited, for No Post can go without a Bit of SA Flames and sort's.<br>
<br>
P.S.  I tested the Resist Fire Buff being fixed and Stacking with Wizard and Mages Elemental Armor tonight, and Yes indeed it was fixed.  Small Praises to Verant for making my Vox Raid's quite a little bit easier now, for I don't have to go through the Explanation of why not to use it, and Can use it.  Damn Verant for not Fixing My Drum's working with Selo's Yet.<br>
<br>
LEOLAN OR XIAN a Favor Please, Lock this Thread not Delete, let this now be taken care of In Game where it should have been taken care of In the First Place.  The Leaders of EoN are working on and Going over this Problem.  Nothing more need's be said or stated on this Thread, no more people's Reputation need's to be singed and stained for just making the smallest little comment on this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#E5E5E6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uulaian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulaian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cyber Pimp</span><br> <font color=#000033>(1/17/01 4:47:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub4.ezboard.com/feqasylumshitlistpeopletowatchoutforonourserver.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=367.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Savena - Alternate Character : Anevas</span><hr size=1> Binoche, the person who was in the group, and did what has been described here, was in fact Anevas. Thats why I keep referring to that name and not Savena, as I have no way of being 100% certain it is the same player (though I do think so heh, one is the other backwards after all).<br>
<br>
As for her not abandoning her group. She left the group without any warning, and she was reassigned because I had to ask Gabriele for another healer, and explained -why- we suddenly needed a new healer when we already had a cleric assigned. <br>
<br>
Anyways, if you read through Gabriele's post thoroughly, you'll see that it too corrolates to the layout of events posted by Jedaka, and backed up by all the other members of the group who have posted here. Even with all this though, I still think Gabriele did a helluva job leading that raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But thats a different story...<br>
<br>
Im not going to get into a 'disect post' game with what Gabriele posted, I think everyone here is fully capable of reading it heh, but im sure someone will do it. Always seems to happen of the shitlist, and so far this thread has been almost free of it... just remember to read the actual post first, rather than other peoples quotes hehe.<br>
<br>
[Edit] 2nd paragraph used to read 'As for here abandoning the group' and 'she was resigned'. Fixed that now.

 According to your logic, since I have never been in a nuclear explosion I am not qualified to comment on it or have an opinion about it. The specific mechanics of higher level raids are the subject of much discussion outside of the game. Any literate person who wishes to can educate themselves as to the intricacies of those mechanics, without ever going on a high level raid, or even playing EQ for that matter. Some higher level players would do well to remember that once they have achieved the highest level possible all the lower level players they have been condescending, rude or insulting to will still be gaining levels and will someday be equal to you. You can bet you won't have their respect or friendship at that stage of events. I would forbear ever going on a high level raid if I knew the only way I could manage it was to subject myself to such a caustic personality as some egotistical players present.<br>
 Telling other high level players that disagree with you that they are stupid and need to go back to Highpass is rude and arrogant. (see velvet glove vs. iron fist above)<br>
 Leaders are known by their knowledge, skills and abilities....Good Leaders are cherished because they inspire loyalty and obedience....Dictators demand...Good Leaders ask with every expectation of being answered positively. Good leaders are considerate of the feelings of their followers and encourage communication, discussion and explanantions....not just CAUSE I SAID SO. <br>
  That may be fine in the heat of battle, or other emergency situations, but not for any preparatory stage of action. A calm, polite, well thought explanation usually clarifies any misunderstanding between mature, intelligent people. <br>
  I guess my comments resolve to basically one thing:<br>
<br>
    If we are striving to be mature, considerate players who derive enjoyment from all aspects of the EQ experience, there is no room for rude, crude, inconsiderate, overbearing, opinionated, vulgar, insulting or demeaning language in communication...in game, on the associated boards...anywhere you present your written message as a reflection of your personality and values. I would think any mature person would want their best foot forward when people they do not know will be forming an opinion about them from their statements, in whatever format they may be presented. Examples speak louder than words. Always.<br>
<br>
  Good hunting and safe travels to you all.<br>
