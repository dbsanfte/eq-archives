Just play and be nice dammit! Causing so much conflict makes the game that much more unenjoyable. (is that a word?)~shrugs~<br>
Fighting and flaming eachother never seems to get anyone anywhere imo. You got a problem, bite you friggin lip if you cant handle it in a mature fashion. There always is going to be something going on that you wont like. Can you change it? Not usually. Can you live with it? You sure as hell can. I personally dont see what came out of this post but some strong dislike for people.<br>
Anyways, grats on Inno, good job peeps.<br>

<br>
That being said, I have a few more things to add to this arguement.<br>
<br>
<br>
First, THERE IS NO BREAK IN HATE! This is why people get labled farmers. Anyone can go up there and kill mobs, loot them, leave, without a problem. Someone pointed out there dislike for drall saying, &quot;they were just here for loot, so there was no problem&quot; (paraphrased). Well, could you perhaps give another way of putting it. There was nothing derogatory (I cant spell, forgive me) about that statement. Drall was simply letting us know that they would not (intentionally) be in our way.<br>
<br>
All right, Kzz, you basically said that the gods are easy. I beg to disagree, but this is not my point. No one, on anything less a Dick raid (whether others were there is irrelivant, it was your raid) has EVER killed Inno. Therefore, I feel this is a large accomplishment. Regardless of its difficulty (and he sure as hell wasnt &quot;easy&quot;).<br>
<br>
Killing a dragon is nothing like killing a god. First of all, dragon roar is much easier to resist compared to Gravity Flux. Obviously, you feel otherwise, and we could argue back and forth all day without an outcome. All i will say, is that for ME, there has been no contest, maybe i have been extremely lucky on dragons and extremely unlucky on gods. Ive resisted gravity flux maybe 1 in 5 times. I resist dragon roar most everytime. If i ever find myself running, i am suprised. As i said, maybe its just me.<br>
<br>
On to the rogue weapon rotting. I first want to ask, when was anyone in SF called over to loot something in the affliction camp? I dont see this as a big deal, but yes, it shows courtesy, and someone pointed it out. I dont recall this ever happening. Now... most importantly, we didnt kill Inno and think, hey, this is going to rot. We thought, shit, lets get our rogue up here. Granted and needless to say, he didnt make it. HOWEVER, even if we had not had someone on the way, it is still up for debate whether to have someone outside the raid come up and simply loot something which they in no way earned. If the decision was left to me, i honestly do not know what i would do.<br>
<br>
About mistakes... everyone makes them. We have made them, dick has made them, we all have. However, on that night, we made no mistakes that effected affliction. We, on the other hand, were basically run over because they let a spite run. We got trained, pure and simple. This was the first thing, and there was no apology. Then we head up to Inno, we get ran over, 6 mobs. ouch. this is when things got out of hand. Needless to say we were angry. Comments were made. I think the situation was solved when i simply shouted, &quot;Why dont we ALL shut up?&quot; and everyone agreed.<br>
<br>
Back to the original issue, Affliction did not do us a favor by LETTING us up there when they were. We had just as much right. I still dont know where this is coming from. We did not come up while they were there. We planned it all day, then as soon as the servers came up, we were there. Ill admit that things were a bit silent between the two groups, but i do not see how storms fury is at more fault than affliction. Perhaps, im missing something, maybe someone could explain.<br>
<br>
Thats all for now. ::sigh:: <p><IMG SRC="http://fareal.com/Destian.png">

<br>
&quot;First, THERE IS NO BREAK IN HATE! This is why people get labled farmers.&quot;<br>
<br>
If this is so, then you are 3 times as much farmers as us, because you were in hate 3 days &quot;prepping for inno&quot; and one day actually doing it.<br>
<br>
&quot;when was anyone in SF called over to loot something in the affliction camp? &quot;<br>
<br>
This never happen..someone misinterpretted this during the thread.  They meant to say we called someone outside of guild to come get loot.<br>
<br>
&quot;We, on the other hand, were basically run over because they let a spite run. We got trained, pure and simple. This was the first thing, and there was no apology. Then we head up to Inno, we get ran over, 6 mobs. ouch. this is when things got out of hand. Needless to say we were angry.&quot;<br>
<br>
We have explained this roughly 20 + times now.  We were doing NOTHING and you said we trained you.  Oh, but I forgot.  We are scrubs and your are a flawless powerful uberguild...you couldnt never admit to screwing up on your own.  The reason their was no apology is because we did nothing wrong.  Pure and simple.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back to the original issue, Affliction did not do us a favor by LETTING us up there when they were. We had just as much right. I still dont know where this is coming from&quot;<br>
<br>
Your guild SAID we could have hate on friday.  Your guild had hate the past 3 days.  YOU WERE BEING GREEDY AND DISRESPECTED what you previously say.  Lets see how you feel.  We will go farm hate for 3 days, then say you can have the zone the next day.  well, the next day comes along and it turns out you cant have the zone because we insist upon sharing it.<br>
<br>
&quot;We planned it all day, then as soon as the servers came up, we were there. &quot;<br>
<br>
More disrespect, because, again, you said we could have the zone then intentionally planned to get in our way because your mission was sooooooo much more important then our pointless 'farming'.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Ill admit that things were a bit silent between the two groups, but i do not see how storms fury is at more fault than affliction. Perhaps, im missing something, maybe someone could explain&quot;<br>
<br>
If you cant see this by now then the subject should be dropped.  All points have been made, you can look at it how you choose.  Your stance on the subject just informs me more of your character.  Once again the server is overcrowded...the NEED to be in hate 4 times a week is a problem. Plain and simple.<br>
<br>
PS:  Because of your guild (mainly rhamels remarks *before he apologized) 2 of our monks left cause they couldnt take your crap.  Thx for screwing up our 1 night a week in a plane for your oooh soo uber mission.<br>

Job well done.  <br>
<br>
I hope you know our night was nearly ruined.  2 of our monks left and koryo (kzzern) was nice enough to come help us.  Thx a ton kzz. w/out you our night was over.  Santhini is new to hateplane and there is no way she can pull solo.  <br>
<br>
Jubei, they didnt PnP us.  Khel talked to members of SF and informed them of our plans friday night.  We got there at the exact same time basically.  Nope, no PnP involved.  I'd like to say though they made the PnP rules because of guilds like storms fury who need to be in planes more than others in order to accomplish their uber mission over our mortal farming mission. <br>
<br>
Vexthorn.  Bah khel will get his own.  Could really care less.  All I know is when we get loot we cant use, someone is immediatly called to come get it.  Thats our point of view though.  Cant blame ya for having yours.  When rogue arms dropped Maeghant and Shadowe were given tells to get to hateplane.  They arrived at same time.  Shadowe won.  Lookin good shadowe.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to state for the record one of your members (Yadan is his name I think) went ld and couldnt log back on.  After the ooc attacks on us, the vexthorn rotting, we offered to help.  He came back after SF left the zone and had no idea where his body was.  Khelder took around 30 min to look around the zone.  At this point we were just getting ready to leave.  After searching for 30 min and having no luck, we left.  That kinda shows you a bit of khels character.<br>
<br>
Wanting the best for your guild and taking challenges is not greed.  Absolutly not.  Getting those items at the expense of others is my friend.<br>
<br>
All and all, great job khelder.  You didnt get upset and kept things as civilized as possible up there.  You have a great rep on the server and when people have a conflict with you, its discussed in a civil manner.  Recently due to overcrowding we had problems with DG and Sharasali.  We learned to work together and have respect for them.  We talked it out like adults and both parties benefited I think.  I would say your the only person/guild khelder has a problem with on the entire server.  To me, that says a lot.<br>
<br>
If we want to play the bully people around game then thats fine.  I think everyone sacrificing a little would benefit people more.  This is only my point of view.<br>

Very nice nite killing Innoruuk. Had fun.<br>
<br>
There was one problem with our puller being fucked up and yelling ooc. Unacceptable. Sorry.<br>
<br>
There is a post by Jubei that has made me put MS on my hate list. Sorry.<br>
<br>
There is a post by another ass-hole that has made me hate Affliction. Sorry.<br>
<br>
I LOVE YOU KZZERN! Can you get me a shiny sword?! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Sorry.<br>
<br>
I have a rogue BP, a Pali sword, a rogue dagger, bard arms and gloves, and a GB in my bank. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Now, all BS aside:<br>
I personally would not run into a plane to loot gear. Just me I guess, but I like earning my things. It gives me something to do. I would have liked to have a rogue get the god-weapon. We did not have one help kill Inny, so no rogue got it, damn.<br>
If SF is assembled from guild rejects then I must say that I am proud to be associated with these rejects. We have killed lots and scored much. Discusting to be the target of such flaming, but it happens. The United States was founded buy fuukin rejects BTW. HAHA<br>
<br>
Now whatever bad I said, please flame away... it shows how much better then me you are.<br>

I missed friday's actual slaying, but I was there on Wednesday clearing the path to inny.  I pulled from about 11am pst til round 4am when we were just too tired to make a 5th attempt on inny.  That's a long long time in PoH and I totally understand if people think that we're up there getting mad loot, but the whole time we were up there we got 1 jacinith, 1 diamond, 3 bard arms and a set of rogue gloves (which didn't rot btw).  That's it, that was our mad haul from 17hours in hate.  Divine Grace came up at one point and after some initial tension they just hung out in their corner and did their thing.  At one point I pulled the Maestro solo back to our FD spot and drall said &quot;Let somebody else kill him, we're just here for Inny.&quot;  I know Drall is a kind of abrasive guy, but leaving a once a week spawn up that we could have taken at least makes him not a total prick).  <br>
<br>
It's hard when this game focusus so highly on the &quot;uber-loot&quot; priciple (heck I did my time to get my RotLC and Treant Fists) to see why a group of folks would want to do something just for the fun of it and to bask in a little bit of vanity after the deed (heck Beowulf got a whole epic poem written about him and he just ripped Grendel's arm off).  I haven't known Drall very long, but I do know that he put this post up because he did something that made him happy and I don't really see why folks are trying to take that away from him.  I mean it can't have been that long ago that you didn't have a guild you were lvl 18 and you were killin orcs in HHP with a bunch of strangers having the time of your life (heck hhp is still some of my best eq memories, I didn't know about spawn times or rare loot, I just ran around and whacked stuff).  Anyways that's all I gotta say.<br>

First off I'd like to know who Affliction spoke with about being in Hate that night. To my knowledage no one except LoV has even made an attempt to tell us they would be going to a plane this weekend, and they posted it on our boards.We did not intintuly try to horde in on someones raid this is childish and yes greedy. We have had PnP pulled on us by another guild and It sux.<br>
<br>
As far as the Vex rotting well the first reaction to it droppimg was get Kal up here now! He was in Lguk and had a port almost immeditly, unfortuitly he did not make it. If our rouge would not have been on Im sure Khel would have been offered the oppertunity to come up and loot it.<br>
<br>
As to our mission being more important then theres well to us maybe it was. We had worked very hard all week getting the tactics down and our ppl ready.To others this is greed because we were in Hate for 3 days, if this is how you feel then so be it. However I dont see it that way. we have been on loot runs there before and done rather well, but in comparison to those runs the last 3 days in Hate paled. Lets see we had 8 drops in 3 days that we were so called farming. Compared to 16 drops in 1 day when we didnt try to move toward Inno. You do the math.<br>
<br>
As to not being able to get to Inno withut Affliction killing the roamers, Hmmmmm I belive we would have made it to him sooner rather then later due to the cross pulling that was happening.Chuck I dont know why you would say that we couldnt get to him without Affliction there but your very mistaken.<br>
<br>
Ppl will call us greedy, disrespectful, and whatever else they can think of. Thats there right and even if they know better its going to happen. We cant change that and I for one am not going to try anymore.Ppl flame because there mad or they think they deserve somthing they didnt get but when all is said and done there will be another flame next weekend about how MS did this or how TTS did that. Its all pointless. You cant call planes you cant call Hate you cant call Fear you cant call Sky, if you could there would have never been a need for someone to think up PnP rules now would there. PnP rules were put in the game to give all a chance at a zone but they have been twisted to cause strife between ppl and I guess even though it wasnt used this weekend it has caused said strife. You dont see us flaming on boards that XXXXXX guild pulled PnP on us this week do you? No you dont. Why because we lived with it. Yes ppl were mad, yes ppl wanted to retaliate in /ooc and /shout. Did we no. Why because we are better then that.<br>
<br>
AS to all who think us greedy farming direspectful whatever, fine your right. I wont lose sleep over it.And to those who have said congrats we thx you all for your kind words and we apreciate your support.<br>

1) SF ported up AFTER Affliction, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
2) You spent 3 nights in Hate this week already, yet you still had rights to come up and flame us and call us farmers.<br>
<br>
3) You asked us to camp out during your fight w/Inno to cut down on lag.  Are you fucking kidding me?  You expect us to give you any respect after you butt in on our raid, hog the zone, and disrespect us?<br>
<br>
4) As for your 8 drops in 3 days compared to 16 in 1 day, that is irrelevant.  You were still in Hate 3 days, what you chose to do w/your time up there is your own business.  The point is you show a little goddamn courtesy and you give others a shot at the zone. <p>Eurmuthur Edgecrusher

<br>
Man I just have one thing to say about this entire situation.  Hate can be done with two groups on either side.  Fear can't so long as Cazic is in the zone.  And even if you take away cazic you shouldn't share it because it will be a fight over who pulls what. <br>
<br>
In the plane of hate it is a little bit easier.  In the case of Innoruk it should of been handled a little better.  I am not sure on the relationship of the two guilds that were there but I do know this, if at any point the other guild made it easier for the guild to kill innoruk by any means, whether it was clearing the area or helping with a cr.  The other guild should of had the right to help or been in on the loot.  In this situation the vexthorne.  That is the best rogue weapon in the game and it decayed because of greed.<br>

&gt;&gt;&quot;when was anyone in SF called over to loot something in the affliction camp? &quot;<br>
This never happen..someone misinterpretted this during the thread. They meant to say we called someone outside of guild to come get loot.<br>
<br>
Sorry this was my mistake.  Somehow I thought Shadowe was in SF when she came in.  I realize now we must have called her into the zone.  Sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
But still, regardless of flames and being pissy, to let God loot rot when there is someone in zone that can use it (even on the other team), is just wrong.  And I bet the guild chat was something along the lines of &quot;Should we let Khelder loot it?   Nah...screw those guys.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes you were trying to pull up your own person, but you should have had Khelder there so he could loot at the last second.  For shame guys.<br>

As far as DG &quot;enforcing PnP&quot; it's kinda hard not too when you're there 24/7. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think it was SF who actually used that PnP on DG first, what goes around comes around, or as they say &quot;Treat others as you would have them treat yourself&quot;.<br>
<br>
  Drall next time you're guild does something great, why post this type of bragging, I-got-the-biggest-balls post and avoid some of these flames. Instead of calling people who want to equally have a chance at poh to themselves farmers, maybe you should thank them for letting you try Inno 4, 5 times to get it right first.

As kalten said, neither guild was SETUP, we both ported at the same time, hence there was no crashing of someone's raid. Neither guild was anywere close to each other, neither guild helped each other at ALL all night, Neither guild used pnp, neither guild has a right to the zone just because they planned something. As for all the affliction member's who were so damaged by us somehow, well I offer my apologies, the ranting via ooc wasn't right and everything was fine until about 4 or 5 am, I got ressed and came back to flaming etc etc so I shot back, Only thing I have to say is dg pulled blatant pnp rules on sf last week and I don't see one gripe' one post' one flame by sf on them. <p>Drall Daboff<br>
