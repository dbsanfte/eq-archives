It's completely justifiable to limit loot to classes.  But to limit loot to lvls doesn't make sense.  Everyone contributes, and we all stand an equal chance of getting killed, so why then would there be some reason that we would be out of a roll?  Because people will have less chance to get an item before they level?  You know what I have to say to that?  BS!  If you wanna get the books off of nag or vox, then DON'T level past 52?  I don't remember it being difficult to avoid lvling.  And with luclin you can put those exps to something else just as useful.  And on top of all of that, ever since kunark there have been alternate dragons to get the books off of.  I believe that gorenaire is supposed to drop the same book as vox.  Verant has considerable fixed/changed this quest.  No more Neriak, and yet loot rules are still based on a quest that doesn't even exist in original form anymore? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uumbrae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Umbrae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.newcreations.net/3d/cubebullet/bulletb_ss1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/15/01 8:50:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> So run a dragon raid and make your own rules <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#575757><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uionas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ionas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Veteran</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/15/01 8:51:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> I think the justification behind this is that lower levels don't have as much to contribute to the raid apart from cannon fodder.

The loot rules are made by the leader, if you do not like them make up your own raid.<br>
<br>
For the last year or so the rules have been the same and Jex is just useing the passeddown loot rules myself and many others used.If you do not like them, spend more time getting exp,Sorry to sound rude but thats the way it has been, is and will be for awhile.<br>
<br>
I stayed level 52 for 3 months..Now tell me you would like to stay 52 for 3 months and i will stop here.There are 8 wars and 3 bards on a raid for naggy most of the time.What are the chances of a bard getting a scale?A single bard can wait a year to get a scale if not called.<br>
<br>
I went to kill nortlav a few times and he's VERY hard to kill. I never did get to kill him.<br>
<br>
if you limit the level the level 50 51 and 52 has a better chance to win and not stay 52 for as long as you would have to.. <p>Brecht Bertolt <BR>

Every person before me did the roll at 48 for all. I changed my raids to make epic pieces different, I think they should be 50+. That is especially true for Paladins and the God-Forsaken Book. It would make a paladin that has been fighting dragons for 15-20 pops extremely mad to lose a book roll to a lvl 48 paladin on his 2nd or 3rd raid. Myself, Autvincere, Kalahari were the last of our slot to get the books, I know people that got books on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> raids that are 55-60 now, while I just dinged 53 this week. It sucks, but most of us will never even kill Gore, Tal, or Sev, so we have to wait at 52. I was there personally for 4months. Consider the books a right of passage, as they are the hardest part of our epic.<br>

well i havent read much on epics, but isnt it true that the epic quest guys dont respond to you or give you your reward if you are below 50? because that would make it the person on the raid will use it and not just have it sit in the bank for levels till they were ready to go on, that way this particular person 50+ can go on while u still have time to wait. same with the scale IMO. it makes sence.<br>

<br>
I've seen too many people (Brecht, Temperance, Kerna, and several other bards/paladins) stuck at lvl 52 waiting and wanting their epic pieces to move on... attending the raids weekly to better their chances and even leading their own raids to get it done... its NOT a fun battle im sure.<br>
<br>
If you're level 50 and you need it you have a lot more time/opportunity to go on the vox/naggy raids (weekly on the norm/nightly due to patching) they, however, dont have as many opportunities unless they penalize themselves to be able to make the raids... you can still attend the raids without the penalties.  You can go and exp... take a night off to kill a dragon... go and exp... etc etc... they, however, have to refrain from leveling at all.  I didnt level past 52 for several reasons 1. I wanted a shot at the eyepatch 2. I wanted to be there fighting along Kerna until he got his book.<br>
<br>
but anyway...<br>
<br>
I've done 52 only for epic pieces... I've done 51-52 only for epic pieces... I've done 50+ only for epic pieces... I've had raids where there was NO level requirement... when I do the raids (if you've raided with me and payed attention to my loot rules posted) I often alter things slightly to make the odds better for the people involved giving everyone an opportunity to take advantage of what will best suit them.<br>
<br>
Just like with me giving the lvl 60 clerics who come along a shot at the eyepatch, or like tonight the pally a shot at the RBB... thats how I do it... I now post that on my threads... "Buffers who come along to help with the dragons who are too high to fight WILL be allowed in my randoms" (this is especially nice when the buffer is a lvl 60 cleric giving everyone lvl 56 res's after the fight) and as always if you dont like it... dont come /shrug<br>
<br>
I do the dragon raids for fun... yes I have always wanted to lead a Vox raid and "win" an eyepatch but I honestly have more fun seeing my friends and devoted raiders go home with the items they need/desire because thats what makes it worth it.<br>
<br>
I would give up any dragon loot item from Vox or Naggy to see half of the raiders I raid with regularly go home with something they need (especially the epics) <br>
<br>
I led the raid the other night and held the res stick for me... I've never held loot for myself before but I was only leading the raid because no one else was and it gave people an opportunity to get the items they desire without having to take on the hassle of leading the raid.... and plain and simple if they didnt like the rules they wouldnt be there.<br>
<br>
By you leaving the raid before it started you made the right choice... you were not happy with the loot rules so you left.  But it comes down to this "if you dont like the rules do it yourself" I cant think of any other way to say it.<br>
<br>
Now on a side note... I fucked up bad on loot for Naggy last night and I want to apologize to everyone who was pissed off at me as well as offer an explanation...<br>
<br>
I let a monk random on the scale... big mistake...<br>
Jaky had sent me tells through half of the raid asking about the rules for the scale... I told him bards/warriors 51+ he kept asking if he could roll, kept sending tells, half of what he said confused the hell out of me and I just got tired of it... I wasnt paying attention to what class he was but with all the spam and chaos eventually I told him he could random... then when it came time to do the loot I was so frustrated by him badgering me I said fuck it and let him roll...<br>
<br>
I should have said "no fuck off" but I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  I have never wanted to do Naggy... and almost all the raiders who know me know that.  I didnt plan to do Naggy in the first place, Celoria was... unfortunatly she couldnt make it and since it had been posted I took it over.  Im glad I did it, I know everyone says Naggy is easier than Vox but honestly I have Vox down to a T most of the time... Naggy however is something that just isnt my thing.<br>
<br>
Im sorry for screwing up the loot... he didnt win anyway so it didnt hurt anything... no reason to be all pissy about it.  But I am sorry... those of you who know me know that thats not something I'd normally do... EVER, and its something that I will NEVER do again.<br>
<br>
(prepare for the beginning of my bitching here)<br>
<br>
After finding out everyone was hell bent and pissed off about the randoming... I find out Jaky aka Golems was also a raid leader (old world dragons) and if this is true I'd really like to know what possessed him to be such an ass about the scale and why he'd be so pushy about randoming on the item.<br>
<br>
As a person who does, or has been a known leader of the raids I'd expect a bit of respect and not the type of behavior that was conducted during the raid.  (the constant messages about loot, the begging to be in the random etc)<br>
<br>
Im sorry Jaky but I dont know you, it just wasnt cool.  Not only did you not fight the dragon but you spammed the hell out of me making my job more difficult than it already was with no concern other than your status on the loot rolls.  <br>
<br>
Anyway... Im dead feking tired... Im blabbing... Im sorry<br>
<br>
Once again to last nights raiders (team naggy and vox) thank you all for a job well done.<br>
<br>

If however you are content to stay sub-53 and go on endless Nag/Vox raids go for it.  Just stop complaining that you're lack of effort isn't rewarding you enough.<br>
<br>
Stanman111 - Everyone contributes, true.  Some (a LOT) more than others however.  We all stand an equal chance of getting killed? Not at all.  Lv 45 caster is much more likely to die than a lv 52 warrior.  Not taking into account player skill, class abilities, hit points, positioning, aggro management, etc...<br>
<br>
Oh and the 'fair loot rules'? What's the point of giving a pally book to a level 46 paladin that plays 6 hours a week and will almost certainly never finish their epic when a lv52 pally has attended countless raids to get the book so he can finish? It's called *realism*<br>

No I dont but thats not the point. An epic weapon is not &quot;required&quot; to play this game. Yes I understand all that bullshit about an &quot;accomplishment&quot; and what not but you can still have fun and be effective without it. Hell there are pally weapons out there now that make the epic look gay and im sure there may be some bard items like that too. Combined with the fact that ive seen dragons like gorenaire and talendor stay up for days at a time then yes staying at 52 for your scales or books when you could be leveling and experiencing the rest of the game is lame.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/ucaoilfhionn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caoilfhionn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Erotic, exotic & a little psychotic</span><br>  Posts: 637<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/16/01 9:07:58 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.altdzin.com/tgl/cao.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> Actually, I'm going to have to agree with Trech here.<br>
<br>
And I'm perfectly in my rights to do so, as I am a paladin, who shot right past her chance to go after Naggy/Vox for my books.  <br>
<br>
Anyone bitching that they are having to stay 52 or below for their books/scale, whatever....it's no ones fault but theirs.  You don't have to LIKE the choice you make, but it's you making the choice not to level.<br>
<br>
Why can't people take responsibility for the choices they make?  I knew damn well when I leveled past 52 that Naggy/Vox were behind me.  And folks are right, there are other ways to procure the scales.  I feel bad that it's so difficult to get the scales/books, but it's a known equation and has been this way for a loooong time.  The only folks that had the right to bitch were the folks over 52 at the time they made the change. <br>
<br>
As for the loot rules, I'm going to be honest here, if 50 and below can't roll on loot, why are they even invited?  If they are nothing but a deadweight, not providing any use or benefit to the raid, I don't understand why you want them there?  Surely there's enough 50-52's to make up a raid force, isn't there?  And if there's not, if you need the others to succeed at the raid, then your answer lies right there, they provide something, and are therefore deserving of loot.<br>
<br>
If character (a) is invited on a raid, and they are pre-50, and it just so happens that character (b) is also invited and is 52 and been waiting for months for their piece, how is that the fault of character (a)?  It's not, it lies solely on the shoulders of character (b) for having such shitty luck.<br>
<br>
I'm quite often asked to attend pickup dragon raids when I play my enchanter.  Thank god I turn them all down. <br>
<br>
&quot;so and so tells you, Hey, we need enchanters on this pickup raid, would you like to attend? We need you, but you can't roll on loot, because you're not 50 yet, care to join?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;you tell so and so, um, thanks but no thanks, you obviously don't need me that badly, eh?&quot;<br>

How much do you have of it right now? Do you even know what you do with the books once you win them? A lot of Paladins I've talked to DON'T (GAH!). The books are 50+, and sometimes 51+, so only Pallies who are closer to 1) Not being able to raid Naggy/Vox anymore 2) Finishing their FA can get them. If you don't like it, go level. It takes 2 days to go from 48 to 50. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2775" target="_spanel"><img src="http://titaniumone.hypermart.net/fisarik_sig.jpg" border=0></a>

Exactly Cao. Also that shitty rule just perpetuates the problem. If I am a bard and have been attending raids since I was level 46 only to be allowed to roll on the scale when Im lvl 50-52 then youve just exponentially decreased my chances of getting said scale making even more and more raids I have to go on before I get one. If some of these folks were allowed to roll on books and scales pre 50 maybe they wouldnt feel like they had to spend 5 months at lvl 52 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub4.ezboard.com/uslvrclvr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SlvrClvr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#E9D756>(12/16/01 10:18:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I have a bitch about loot rules</span><hr size=1> You know the raid rules... you don't like it DON'T attend! just like you said... it's YOUR CHOICE... just like it's the choice of that bard or paladin to stay 52.<br>
<br>
i fully agree that a raid leader can restrict who gets what. Leading a damned raid is by no means easy or fun, and by god i'll (and anyone else leading raids) will run them how they see fit. <br>
<br>
I'm lvl 56 now, i also have a 59 warrior still needing his scales... i know damned well that i will never have a chance at killing gore, scalekeeper, or talendor... for a LONG time. why? because my guild isn't ready to do so... just like the thousands of other people out there who play this game. you can't just do a pick up raid to kill these dragons... well i take that back... i'm sure someone could, but it would be beyond extremely difficult.<br>
<br>
like someone said before... QUIT WHINING about your choice.  and my god... if you don't like how raids are being run, RUN YOUR OWN!! i'm soooooooo TIRED of people bitching because of how raids are run but they will NEVER even attempt to run their own.<br>
<br>
Unlike killing the higher level dragons, ANYONE can lead a raid.  They're just to damned lazy to do so!<br>
